4961718,4,B00664AM02,"'Song of Lunch' is a short BBC film brought to us by Masterpiece Theatre. It is a film of love lost.

Alan Richman plays 'He', no names mentioned. He is an editor and sometimes poet. He has arranged for a meeting with an old flame, and it turns out, 'She', played by Emma Thompson, left him for someone else. He does most of the narration, telling his tale, a sodden tale it seems. He plans the lunch at an old restaruant they used to inhabit, and he relives the days of yore down to the tablecloths and the owner. It turns out eveything has changed, as it is won't to do after 15 years. Strike this as a real negative for him. He starts drinking as soon as he sits down. It appears that liquid meals are his style. She comes in the door, much better looking and dressed than he remembers. In his mind he starts reliving the memories of her. She has to bring him back to the present several times.

""He"" however, is stuck in his own mind. As the drinking resumes she makes the statement that he is ""out to lunch at your own lunch"". That pretty well sums it up. He is very frustrating, you want to kick him or slap his face. We have all met people like this, and it is often that the alcohol brings out their worst side. He is not a likeable person, and he keeps talking. I wanted to say to him, ""shut up and let her talk."" She has a lot to say and most of it is 'right on'. She remembers correctly and after this lunch she must be thankful that she did not end up with him.

We have a portrait of this couple, the lives they had together and the lives they lead now. She knows him well and tells him that his poetry is not his therapy. It is quite apparent that he needs the latter. He is an insufferable prig from my viewpoint, and I wonder how the rest of his life will evolve. The film's camerawork is superb. It is the faces and the expressions of these two that convey most of the story. Memories are made of this, it seems.

4961719,3,B00664AM02,"I caught this on PBS last night and thought it was OK. Former lovers meet after fifteen years and it's obvious why they never became a couple since he's an egotistical, leering drunkard and she's absolutely smug in her marriage and sons.
The two never are given names but are referred to as ""he"" and ""she"", which suits the anonymity of Thompson and Rickman to the audience and finally to each other. Adapted from a poem by Christopher Reid, I found the long camera shots on ""he's"" face, he does all the internal dialogue, a little too long. When ""she"" speaks, it's almost startling since the viewer has forgotten ""she"" is still there and it's obvious, so has ""he"". Why did these two meet after all these years is never made clear, though ""he"" is a bit of a stalker and once went to Paris to lurk outside ""she's"" apartment where she lives with husband and children--very creepy. ""She"" is pretty dull and ""he"" is just awful, but watching Song of Lunch made me think about past relationships we yearn for that in the cold light of noon, were never going anywhere and it was better that we just moved on.",1321228800,3,1100,4.477611940298507
4961720,2,B00664AM02,""" A Song of Lunch' is a terribly sad waste of acting talent--Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman star in this attempt to bring to life a pretentious poem about a couple once intimate who have gone their separate ways for a dozen years and now meet for lunch in a restaurant they used to enjoy when they were together.  It is a study of age and change and loss; the man in particular has never recovered from the the breakup of this relationship.  Poignant though it is, the man is so determinedly narcissistic that he corrodes any sympathy the viewer might otherwise have developed.  Except for the luminous Emma, there's no reason to watch--poor Alan Rickman gets to do noting but look semi-conscious for an hour.",1321142400,11,709,4.611111111111111

4961724,3,B00664AM02,"Right off the bat, you are told that Alan Rickman plays a very unlikeable character here because his inner voice is overly complicated and self-regarding.  He dresses up everything he does with complicated descriptions.

His most leering and bizarre and obviously alone too much with his own thoughts temperament is obvious without showing him transfixed by a young waitress in the way that he thinks about Emma Thompson who previously played his wronged wife in Love Actually.  So this short play could be an epilogue to that relationship in which she gets away from him and flourishes with a better person (pictured on a back book cover as her real life husband).

It's clear that she should not have accepted his lunch invitation and that she didn't do it to be kind (crossing the tunnel from Paris) but because she needs to put him in his place in a nonoffensive way so he understands that while she has a better life, he musn't feel nasty about it or over attribute the importance of their past relationship.  He stood outside her Paris residence a few months earlier so possibly she espied him and is taking precautions.

I wouldn't recommend this film.  It's nice to see Emma Thompson looking so pretty with plum eye shadow and nice earrings but Alan Rickman does a thorough job of being awful - just dirty minded and souled and inappropriately entangled with someone(s) better than he deserved when he was younger and they were younger.  He's unable to have such opportunities for swan meat these days and seems to be gagging with frustration.  Nice older men aren't lonely even if they are not in a relationship - not only do they have inner resources but they are attractive to others so someone will always want to talk to them.

And that's where Massimo comes in.  I think that a certain type of man who takes care of his own family and a type of culture that is not as judgmental and twisted as Alan Rickman's inner voice would create a safe place to age with bonhomie and camaderie.",1415491200,2,1996,4.642045454545454

4961726,5,B00664AM02,"A stellar performance by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman in this beautifully scripted and  thoughtfully directed film version of Christopher Reids provocative poem. The film is a fitting tribute to the poet whose tantalising narrative encapsulates the trials and tribulations of a relationship breakdown and its consequences.
The setting could be just around the corner from you or me, a place that is part of ones identity in a particular time that fades with the process of aging and can never be retrieved.
Tension between the estranged former lovers is portrayed through the stunning repartee and has one occasionally feeling a bit voyeuristic and maybe even a little affronted. Nonetheless the film intelligently handles intimacy of a particular kind, the kind that can make purists feel uncomfortable, and social rebels triumphant.  A daring venture that is undoubtedly successful in its representation of a Christopher Reid classic.",1409356800,,938,5.417808219178082

Song of Lunch contains everything you need to appreciate the value of 50 minutes of your time -- startling performances, clever dialogue, and patient pauses.  Thompson and Rickman go way back as colleagues.  Their mutual comfort, while evident in every moment, does not disguise the tension of misunderstanding stemming from evaporated feelings.  Emma's monologue near the end is worth the price itself and Alan's descent into the haze of liquid memory commands both attention and pathos.  A grand example of the ""moment"" lending significance to the ""thing.""",1400284800,,584,5.304347826086956

If I want to watch someone be a drunken boor (as Rickman played in this film) there are some relatives I could invite to dinner. Loved the premise of two interesting people who cared for one another once getting together after years. The story could have been so much more rather than descend into drunken rudeness. Thompson's character was lovely, and deserved a better dinner companion. Imagine if a gentleman of her quality had sat down to dinner with her, and the fascinating conversation they might have had. I guess my expectations were dashed as I thought these two actors would play characters who were more sympatico and sober.

Watch this with the subtitles turned on, so as not to miss the brilliant poetry.

This performance by Alan Rickman deserves many awards.  The witty internal monologue, delivered just perfectly, is complimented by the best performance of slowly increasing drunkenness in modern television history.  Each sip, each sigh, is perfect, as the mid-priced Chianti slowly colours the entire performance.

Rickman's performance compliments the poetry.  When he orders the grappa, the play crystallizes before your eyes.  This is both bathetic and laugh out loud funny.",1366588800,4,565,5.576470588235294

4961750,4,B00664AM02,"This movie is really written for TV.  Perhaps an hour or less long, it is a kind of poetic storytelling that only two great actors like Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman can pull through.

Two former lovers decide to meet for lunch after not seeing each other for nearly 15 years.  In this movie they are nameless.  He is an editor living a mundane life that is boring both professionally and personally.  He is a failed writer who never published anything after his first book of poetry failed to find readers on the market.  She on the other hand, is happily married to a well known, bestselling author and lives in Paris. As their lunch progresses it becomes obvious that ""he"" is on the loosing end of this reunion.  Their mutual reflection on their former relationship seems to shed the kind of light that is different for each one of them.  It is a story with deep emotion that has a very good message - for every love there is a time and place.  Love must be nurtured and protected from the outsiders, because ""muses"" and ""princes (of death/a metaphor)"" are meant to test it. And when test like that happens to any couple it typically brings victory to the one that was wronged and the other has the eternity to reflect on it with endless remorse and regret about the missed opportunity for happiness and fulfillment.  What is in the past is past.  Life moves on.  Everything else ends or dies.

Wonderful, witty dialogue that two character actors (Thomson and Rickman) bring to a sober end.  Loved it!",1356307200,3,1505,4.5464684014869885

4961754,3,B00664AM02,"First off, let me say that if you're a fan of British poet-writer Christopher Reid, you'll probably enjoy this offering from PBS' Masterpiece Contemporary series, which originally aired in November, 2011, as it, one would think, would seem to be a faithful adaptation of his prose poem of the same name.  Or, if you're a fan of actors Alan Rickman or Emma Thompson, who play the two principal characters - referred to only as ""he"" and ""she"" - ex-lovers who meet for lunch for the first time in 15 years, you'll probably delight in their sublime, nuanced performances.

However, while I enjoyed watching two distinguished artists ply their craft, I just couldn't warm to the ""he"" character becuz, as a bitter, effete, lecherous, alcoholic boor, he was very unsympathetic and - even worse - a cliche (esp since he's a failed poet/writer).  A further complication is that the storyline became predictable after he downed his second - if not his first - glass of wine.

Despite the wonderful performances (esp by Rickman) and the somewhat clever analogy regarding the changes to the ""she"" character and to the restaurant in which the ex-lovers dine wrought by the 15 year interim, upon the conclusion of THE SONG OF LUNCH, I just couldn't help feeling that I had just wasted 50 minutes.",1330214400,7,1282,4.840182648401827
4961755,3,B00664AM02,"This DVD contains an episode of the new Masterpiece Contemporary drama series being shown on TV. It originally aired on the BBC and probably BBC America, though it may have been on PBS as were some other Masterpiece Contemporary shows.

As noted by other reviewers, it is ""narrative poem"" and it's Alan Rickman's voice-over which fills much of the audio track. It's a simple story of two former lovers meeting 15 years after they have separated. It's a ""lunch date"". To say how it works out would be a spoiler alert so I won't go there. I will say that there is not a lot of conversation between them, so Emma Thompson doesn't get to say a lot (nor Rickman when he is not the off-screen narrator). But Both are great actors and Thompson has a face I could have the camera stay on for hours! Sadly the film is short; just 48 minutes. There are no special features on the DVD except for a few BBC previews.

I enjoyed spending the 48 minutes with these two great actors but wouldn't exactly call it a ""Masterpiece""

4961756,5,B00664AM02,"THE SONG OF LUNCH is an exceptional, very unique television drama.

The one-hour show is, in fact, adapted from a beautiful narrative poem by Christopher Reid, most of which is presented in a voice-over as stream-of-consciousness thought.

Alan Rickman plays a bitter London book editor who is meeting his former lover (Emma Thompson) for lunch at the restaurant they used to frequent.  The couple hasn't seen each other for fifteen years.  She is now a wife and mother, living in Paris, married to a successful writer, while Rickman, having failed in his artistic endeavors, detests his low level position at the publishing house where he works.

The reunion does not go well from the start.  Not only has the restaurant changed from what Rickman remembers, but also once Emma arrives, he begins to over indulge in the grape and his attitude becomes surly.

Director Niall MacCormick has done a fine job of keeping this low-key drama engrossing and seemingly unconfined, not an easy feat since most of the action is set in the restaurant at a small corner table.  And, of course, Rickman and Ms. Thompson are nothing short of brilliant in their roles.

THE SONG OF LUNCH is on DVD from BBC Video.

4961757,2,B00664AM02,"I love both Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose performances in this film are superb, but, quite frankly, the ""Song of Lunch"" gave me a nasty case of indigestion!

There is nothing worse than dining at a restaurant and being anywhere near a man and woman in the midst of a tiff, especially when he is embarrassing her by drinking too much wine. Precisely because Thompson and Rickman are so skilled at their art, I felt as if I had been thrust into the midst of these ex-lovers' problems (mostly his, actually; she had the good sense to leave him long ago for another man whom she married happily). I wanted to pay the bill and leave--or turn off the telly--especially when he began guzzling that second bottle of wine.

Although I was initially willing to accept the literary device of poetry, which Rickman delivers peerlessly in voice-over, after a while, it seemed merely pretentious and self-indulgent.

What I will say is that Alan Rickman's ability to convey a very complex character with nothing more than his facial expressions and a voiceover track is mesmerizing.  I did not want to like Song of Lunch, the only reason I tuned in is because I'm a diehard Rickmaniac.  I was very surprised to find that I was drawn into they way Mr. Rickman was able to convey vulnerability within a self-centered, egotistical character within the first 5 minutes.  Emma Thompson, as the no-nonsense former flame is as excellent as always, but I felt a bit sorry for her, she gets very little screen time and is almost set dressing.",1322524800,6,725,4.596899224806202

While he wrote only one book and is unsuccessful, she married a very successful author and is enjoying her life with her husband and children. The action in the film is sparse, but very telling. The acting is perfect. The film excells in the poetry of its language.",1322524800,3,548,4.6020408163265305

There are two positive reviews here already which I second and can't improve upon.  Personally, I loved this, but as noted it's not for everyone. It's mainly the inner monologue of ""He"" with Rickman and Thompson serving as eye-candy, depending on your opinion of them.  I find his character is probably the most realistic one I've seen him play.  Not to say that I would like to have a lunch like this with him!  He is peevish, egotistical and self-destructive.**  You may fail to be drawn in by him at the beginning and just find him a drunken bore or a creepy stalker as some other reviewers did, or (SPOILERS) you might find the way he screws it up a little heartbreaking, willing him to do or say things differently - some people might find that a bit painful to sit through.  However, I didn't find the ""poem"" or the concept pretentious, at all.  I can't hear ""Happy Times"" anymore without thinking of TSOL and feeling that bit wistful because of it. And on the other hand if you are a Rickmaniac (LIKE ME), you may be so distracted by the illusion of having him sitting across the table from you that you may not care how badly he behaves...

**Mmmkay, people, to amend my review ...I am talking about the FICTIONAL CHARACTER ""He"", NOT Alan Rickman, himself!!!  I find AR's portrayal of such a CHARACTER: washed-up, bitter, an alcoholic, is a REALISTIC portrayal of SUCH a PERSON, which is NOT Alan Rickman, playing himself! FAR FROM IT!

In that story lies only sadness. Even Alan Rickman's lucious voice-over as he read the poem did not comfort me. And the grappa was also all too familiar. After guzzling a few bottles of wine, my family always switched over to some knock-out punch-beverage such as grappa, sambucca or brandy, then proceeded to drive home. It's a miracle they didn't kill anyone in the process

For me, the entire move started off badly when the producer or whomever, chose to cover Alan Rickman's warm brown eyes with fickle green ones.  Perhaps we needed those to take us from a grand an actor beloved by millions, to a character whose future lies in the gutter to which he is rapidly heading. Rather than keep this movie, I have decided to throw it away.

While I am happy I purchased and saw this movie, I can't say it's one of my favorites...",1498348800,,292,3.8983050847457625

8493683,1,B00664AM02,"It just was not a good movie. The acting was wonderful, and they did they best with the terrible material, but the movie just never does get good.",1456099200,,146,4.25
8493684,3,B00664AM02,"I didn't know this was sort of a vignette or episode rather than a movie. The plot is interesting enough, and the acting is always good, but it focuses on one lunch date with spotty references to their past. While a film like this at this length might seem enough for this situation, it was a bit too short and contrived. I was a little confused about the ending and what the connection was; it may be that I was being a little dense. Alan and Emma usually are dynamic together, and I just wasn't feeling it with this one.",1449705600,,522,4.23

8493686,5,B00664AM02,Very rewarding movie based on a poem. Reviews are way off...just need to understand that this is NOT an action packed love movie. It is a very well performed piece of art.,1430697600,,171,4.375
