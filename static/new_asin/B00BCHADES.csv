8565947,5,B00BCHADES,"Outstanding Swiss film which exposes the barbaric treatment of orphans at the hands of Swiss farmers up until 1960. The children were referred to farms where, even tough they were meant to go to school, they spent most of their day working beyond their physical capacity and for very meager food. Arrestingly beautiful alpine landscapes. Untouched antique  farmhouses. Authentic village celebrations. Adorable school house.
Very fine cast. German language, English subtitles .",1492905600,,476,5.611111111111111
