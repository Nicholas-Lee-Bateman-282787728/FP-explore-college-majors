2336308,4,B0009Y02AU,"Fourteen felines were used to make the screwball comedy RHUBARB; the most famous of these was ""Orangey,"" who 10 years later was ""Cat"" in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Old Wrigley Field in Los Angeles appears here; sports fans may recall this park from the early '60s TV show, ""Home Run Derby.""

""Rhubarb"" is the story of a feisty feral cat who steals the golfball of an eccentric millionaire ball team owner, along with the man's heart. He eventually captures the golf course dweller and names it ""Rhubarb"" (which in baseball lingo is a heated argument, usually between the umpire and a coach, manager or player). After they'd spent two contented years together, the man who is now dying leaves all his money and the sports team to Rhubarb.

The players aren't too happy with being owned by a cat and they stage a mass walkout. Rhubarb's appointed caretaker, Eric Yeagar (Milland) uses some trickery to convince the superstitious team that their cat is in reality a lucky charm. Believing they can't lose makes the once faltering ""Brooklyns"" invincible; they win the pennant and are huge favorites to repeat in the World Series. Bookmakers overwhelmed with the number of ""sure bets"" decide to eliminate the source of Brooklyn's success-- Rhubarb.

Among the movie's extensive number of uncredited actors are Strother Martin ('Shorty' McGirk) and Leonard Nimoy (young ballplayer). Watch in the final scene for a cameo by Paul Douglas (Jan Sterling's husband), who uses a play on words to plug his latest project, ""A Letter to Three Wives.""

Bill Frawley also appeared in two other baseball movies (that starred William Bendix):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BABE-RUTH-STORY/dp/B000NA7WSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BABE RUTH STORY</a>&nbsp;(1948) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KILL-THE-UMPIRE/dp/B000MNOX80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KILL THE UMPIRE</a>&nbsp;(1950), which is presented here as a double feature along with SAFE AT HOME (1962) (includes cameos by the '62 Yankees).

2336309,5,B0009Y02AU,"If you've never seen this 1951 screwball comedy, you have missed a real gem. A cat that can fight and beat dogs, an eccentric baseball team owner who dies and leaves the team to the cat (Rhubarb), the cat's guardian (Ray Milland) whose fiancee is allergic to cats, a group of gangsters who believe Rhubarb is hurting their earnings in the field of betting (the team begins to win after they believe Rhubarb is good luck), and the dead owner's relations who have been left penniless by Rhubarb usurping them in their inheritance all mix together to make great fun for cat lovers and baseball lovers alike. Nobody remembers this one very much because it is rarely televised and also because it was made by Paramount, a studio that tends to neglect its many classic films. In fact, the expression that the Joker utters in the 1989 Batman film : ""Never rub another man's Rhubarb"" refers to this film, although almost everyone assumed a more unsavory meaning for the expression. The baseball team in this film starts to turn their luck around when one batter pets (rubs) Rhubarb before a game. It really is a great family movie, but not many people at all have seen this one and thus few understand what the Joker was talking about.

This film is finally coming to DVD July 1. That is the good news. The bad news is that there will be no extras included.",1211414400,38,1349,4.551440329218107

It's a cute story of a losing ball team that is inherited by the cat of the rich owner.  The owner's daughter is not happy and seeks revenge.  The team manager gets the duty of the cat's caretaker, despite his fiance's cat allergy.  The cat is not known for it's friendliness, by the way.  Of course it has the required happy ending for movies of this era.  My 6 and 8 year old kids even enjoyed it.",1168905600,2,573,4.163636363636364

2336336,5,B0009Y02AU,"Most folks know ""It Happens Every Spring"" starring Ray Milland but have less knowledge of his other baseball comedy ""Rhubarb"". Probably falls into the scatterbrain comedy category Rhubarb is just a fun movie (yes probably more fun if you are also a cat fan) with some predictable turns and some not so predictable turns. Stocked with plenty of stars of the late 40's (Ray Milland, William Frawley), upcoming stars (Leonard Nimoy, Strother Martin) and backed with a great group of character actors who you will immediately recognize. Also a nice tip of the hat to the crazy that Brooklyn baseball fans were at this time period.",1461024000,,626,4.915094339622642

2336341,5,B0009Y02AU,"This is a solid, well made, delightful little comedy from 1951.  The cat, when we first encounter him, is feral.  He steals golf balls from millionaires, while another millionaire, T.J. Banner, watches gleefully from a shady spot on the golf course.  Banner happens to own the Brooklyn Dodgers.  (The Dodgers are the club clearly intended in the movie, though they're called something else.)  The teams manager is played by William FrawleyFred Mertz in I Love Lucy.

Banner tells the club's press agent, Eric Yaeger, played by Ray Milland, ""That cat I have got to have!""  Eric manages to catch the cat and deliver him to Mr. Banner, who names the snarling orange buzzsaw Rhubarb.  Rhubarb and Banner bond, and Banner leaves everything to Rhubarb in his will$30 million, plus the Brooklyn Dodgers.  He appoints Eric to be Rhubarb's guardian.  Banner's hostile daughter, Myra, becomes Rhubarb's vicious antagonist, determined to break the will.  In the last line of his will, Banner says, ""I only regret that I won't be here to see the fun.""  You should be there to see the fun.

This is a good film for a family, without being saccharine.  (There's plenty of anthropomorphizing, of course.)  Besides the appeal to kids, older adults might like to see the period cars and clothes, along with a boatload of fine character actors playing bookies, gangsters, and ball players.  There are fewer character actresses, but they're memorable.  One is Madge Blake, playing a woman who brings her Persian cat to the ball games to meet Rhubarb.  Blake had a long filmography, including ""An American in Paris"" and ""Singin' in the Rain.""  There, she was Dora Bailey, the society gossip columnist who interviewed Gene Kelly at the opening of his movie ""The Royal Rascal.""  In the 1950's, Blake may have defined a certain type of woman for us:  the plump, foolish, charming matron.",1448150400,4,1864,4.929260450160772

2336390,4,B0009Y02AU,"Sweet family movie that cat fans will especially love. However, if you're a fan of the hilarious novel by H. Allen Smith, you should know that many elements of the original story were modified or dropped altogether, while storylines that had nothing to do with the novel were added to the movie script. Even though the motion picture rating system didn't exist in 1951, there must have been a consensus to ensure that the movie version of ""Rhubarb"" would be for suitable for general audiences. A movie version that matched Smith's novel more closely would have earned a PG13.",1415232000,,575,4.818181818181818

Keep your eyes open for a young Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke) and Leonard Nimoy (strange visitor from another planet...Bazinga!). While not Oscar material, it's just a fun, ""can I haz bazeball cat"" movie.  Buy it!  P.S.

If you liked the movie ""Miracle on 34th Street"", you will also love ""Rhubarb"".

Rhubarb is not a lovable cat, but he maintains his dignity and is loyal to his owner, Gene Lockhart ... and also to the baseball team which he inherits from his owner.

2336472,5,B0009Y02AU,"I had heard of this movie, and was thrilled to see it finally released on DVD.  As soon as it arrived, I opened it up and popped it in the DVD player.

We first meet Rhubarb as a rather nasty feral cat who hangs around at a golf course and steals golf balls.  Millionaire T.J. Banner takes a shine to the kitty, and adopts him.  The two become fast friends.  Banner owns a baseball team called the Brooklyn Loons.  When he passes away, he shocks everyone, including his cat-hating, money-hungry daughter, Myra, when the will is read, and Rhubarb inherits the bulk of his fortune, including the baseball team.  Myra doesn't even get to be the cat's guardian; that role goes to Eric Yeager, the team's publicist, who also must run the team.  At first, Eric doesn't want the role, but after a run-in with Myra, he changes his mind, and so the fun begins.

The ballplayers are not thrilled at first to be working for a cat, but Rhubarb soon wins them over, and becomes a good luck charm for the team.  He becomes very popular with the fans, especially with a pretty lady cat.  But if life went smoothly after that, we would not have much of a movie.  Eric's fiancee, Polly, soon realizes she is allergic to Rhubarb.  There is also an attempted catnapping/murder, a court case, as well as a real catnapping later on in the story.

This movie is funny and very well-acted, with a wonderful story with a happy ending.  It's the kind of movie that they don't make any more, but you wish they still did.  If you have kids, you don't have to be afraid to let them watch this.  It's a fun movie for everyone.

There is another baseball movie starring Ray Milland, ""It Happens Every Spring"".  I have an old VHS copy, but I wish it would come out on DVD, it is just as good as this one.",1350432000,,1773,4.334346504559271
2336473,5,B0009Y02AU,"If you enjoy light romantic comedies from past times (1951) this movie is for you.  Rhubarb is a cat of uncertain paternity but no uncertain personality who finds himself a millionaire and mascot of a losing baseball team.  Through a series of mishaps and high-jinks both cat and team end up winners, boy gets girl, and miscreants get their come-uppance.  Ray Milland, a dashing young man in this movie, makes the perfect hero to counter lovely Jan Sterling.  A ""rhubarb"" in baseball slang mean a fight or argument, and the feisty cat, in a turnabout of the usual pecking order, is not afraid to take on any dog and he comes out the winner every time.  This refreshing movie is a good antidote to the doom and gloom of current times.

This movie will not necessarily please everyone.  It's in black and white, and the style of stories and movie-making has changed rather drastically in the past 60 years.  But for those who like the genre, it will be a good choice for an evening's entertainment.",1349395200,,996,4.619318181818182

So when I discovered it was available through Amazon, of course I had to buy it.  Though more expensive than most movies, it was worth every penny of the cost, as now I can watch it whenever I want.  It is a movie that I will feel free to view with my grandchildren, and I know they will enjoy this special movie about a cat who owned a baseball team.",1519776000,,455,3.978021978021978

The millionaire dies and leaves his estate to the cat, provoking a legal challenge from his greedy daughter.  Caught in the middle are the team GM (Ray Milland) and his long-suffering girlfriend (Jan Sterling).  Generally bright film satirizes baseball tradition, hero-worship and early commercial television, but the real star of the show is Rhubarb (real name: ""Orangey"").  Look quick for Leonard Nimoy as one of the ballplayers.  I paid less than ten bucks for my DVD back in 2013.",1508198400,7,602,5.361702127659575

Considering it was made way before there was any CGI it is amazing how they got the cat to act (fetching golf balls, chasing dogs, being ferocious as well as sweet).  The old billionaire who adopts the cat because he is tired of ""Yes"" men all around him and likes that the cat is so feisty  has some great lines.  One is ""I like to eat artichokes because they fight back.""  Really worth the rental fee if you want to lighten up and have a good laugh.",1486425600,2,535,4.0476190476190474
