8652805,5,B00JPFTXR2,This Barney DVD is all about having fun outside with friends.  I like to put it on to cheer up my daughter when its rainy outside so she can think about all the fun she will have when the rain goes away.  It features typical Barney songs that I admit I sing along to and its very kid-friendly.  Even though my daughter has seen tons of Barney DVDs they never get old to her.,1406073600,2,374,4.027027027027027
