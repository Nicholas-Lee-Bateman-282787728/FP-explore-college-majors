8528903,5,B008MC27KE,This DVD certainly is not for advanced users of Nikon cameras but for amateurs like me who use this amgnificient camera from time to time it is a real life saver. You can watch any chapter you wish as this is DVD. When I go shooting I rewatch it for being better prepared. I highly recommed it.,1353542400,,294,4.175438596491228
8528904,2,B008MC27KE,"This was a very superficial, poorly produced item...sorry I spent my money on it. There needed to be more guidance as to preferable settings. Video information was minimal and not especially useful.",1349913600,,198,5.21875
8528905,3,B008MC27KE,"I suspect most owners of $3,000 cameras will be well aquainted with the fundamentals of photography. On second thought, that assumption could be wrong. I have owned several previous Nikon SLR cameras, and Nikon has introduced us to this high resoultion technology. If you are a first time Nikon owner, for example one of the Canonites leaving the pack to become a Nikonian - this video could be helpful. Newbies who bought Nikon D800/D800E as amateur photographers without much skill or experience, you will require other sources of education in addition to this talking camera manual.

On the positive side, this video is only a small investment that if viewed before, or during your unboxing ceremony - time well spent. However, I've owned the camera for months, and had already taken thousands of photos with it. So, I'm looking for more advanced information, insights, etc., at lot more than a review of basic settings.

Yes, he systematically points out the location of every button, switch, and menu item. I had already read the Nikon guide, and quickly went from very interested to bored. You might be left wanting a deep dive into more advanced examples of work that could be produced with this extremely high-resolution camera. Not much indication that the guy actually uses the D800 camera to produce high quality photographs, yet he is obviously a knowledgeable camera user. I didn't learn enough new information, my bad.

He is a fast talker, so you will be done viewing in no time.",1349568000,4,1494,4.920634920634921
