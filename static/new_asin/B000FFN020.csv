8121925,5,B000FFN020,"Racing Through Time-Jaguar & Les Mans. Jaguar on Cover and looks like replica of 67' Le Mans Corvette-Interesting DVD:

Although the Dvd is about Jaguar,and The Le Mans Program does not show any Visible Vettes that I can see,there is good footage here,Unmastered it seems but pretty good. There is brief footage of the Rover Car At Le Mans(Turbine),Lots of Ferrari,Maserati,Aston Martin,great sound/color period footage and some brief later on Modern Vintage Racing. The Jaguar portion covers up to the Ford ownership,and it is a brief history,with Interviews from Racing drivers,both movies are Narrated by A Briton and the Dvd is from Canada. Despite it's cheap price it is a good deal despite the cover and lack of Corvettes in my view. For a Amateur Production not completely amateur but independently done is better like it. I'd recommend it to Le Mans Racing Fans and Jaguar Fans.",1420675200,,886,5.0272108843537415

I won't even bother commenting on the all-caps, but I guess the only reasonable excuse for such an error-riddled DVD case and ""Editorial Review"" is that the distributor, Front Row Entertainment, is the low-budget outfit in Dubai UAE, responsible for the current DVD distribution of such gems as ""Love Laughs at Andy Hardy,"" ""Tarzan and the Green Goddess,"" ""Worst Crimes of the 20th Century,"" and ""Bikini Bistro,"" to name but a tithe of their classics. It's 2012, guys. Sir Stirling Craufurd Moss, OBE FIE, will be 83 this year, and started his competition career in 1948 -- haven't you had quite enough time to learn to spell his name? And ""Les Mans?"" It's ""Le Mans;"" and speaking of ""it's,"" the ""apostrophe s"" usually denotes the possessive, but by one of the many quirks of the English language, in the case of the word ""it,"" the ""apostrophe s"" denotes a contraction of ""it is,"" NOT the possessive ""something that belongs to 'it.'"" The possessive of ""it"" is ""its"" -- no apostrophe (""Jaguar from it's founding in 1922"" is incorrect; ""Jaguar from its founding in 1922"" IS correct, as would be ""Jaguar's founding in 1922""). If you're going to distribute to the English-speaking world, learn English. As for ""Les Mans,"" it's just plain wrong, as is ""LeMans"" -- it's ""Le Mans.""

The video is OK -- just -- though culled from sources to whom one hopes Front Row Entertainment has actually paid the licensing fees.",1327622400,,2340,4.951653944020356
8121927,4,B000FFN020,"Being a Jag owner and enthusiast, I thought I'd give this video a try. It does portray a lot of good, never before seen at least by me, racing footage from different race tracks and Le Mans during the golden years of sports car racing featuring not just Jaguars, but many other marques also. Found it to be quite entertaining and recommend it to anyone interested in vintage racing history.",1299801600,,390,4.585714285714285
