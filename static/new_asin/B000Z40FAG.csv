8632500,5,B000Z40FAG,"I loved American Masters special ""Still Life"" about Marilyn Monroe I know so much about her, but this show told me alittle bit more where I actually feel like I know her. It had such an awesome array of people who knew her and they made her real and explained in a different way why she was and is so special.",1279411200,,309,4.081967213114754
8632501,5,B000Z40FAG,"This was an absolutely excellent documentary by PBS & American Masters about the people who photographed Marilyn Monroe. They all share their thoughts on working with Marilyn, what it was like to photograph her, and what her personality was really like to them. Norman Mailer & Gloria Steinem also share their thoughts, and they and everyone else is so fascinating to listen too. If you are a Marilyn fan, and/or interested in photography you should definitely have this in your DVD collection.",1211760000,3,494,5.036585365853658
