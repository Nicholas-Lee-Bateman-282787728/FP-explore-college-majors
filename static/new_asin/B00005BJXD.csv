The DVD is high-quality in that the viewer feels as if he/she is freefalling and parachuting along with the persons on the video. With ""Freefall Extreme"" you become part of this thrilling adventure.",1107734400,6,376,5.080645161290323
7937675,4,B00005BJXD,"This double featured DVD containing two documentaries that complement each other. It has great replay value; being new to the sport I have seen it several times and tortured my friends and family with it. It is a good introduction to the fastest non motorized sport in the world that walks the viewer through some basic principles on the physics behind skydiving and offers a brief historical view on the sport.
Seasoned skydivers will probably take exception to the strong bias in the documentaries that overemphasize protagonist, Adrian Nicholas, while more prominent figures are ignored. This is the main reason while I cannot rate this DVD above 4 stars.
All in all this is a good bang for the buck and a useful tool fot skydivers to explain the sport to outsiders.",1015632000,19,769,4.833333333333333
