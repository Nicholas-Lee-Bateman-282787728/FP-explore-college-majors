Sweet Paradise and the Jewel house are important in these four episodes. The fashionable Oshare appears in an interestesting episode; Boss and the hamchanzu try to teach her how to be a ""working class"" Ham.

It is a Region 2 DVD; be sure your player plays Japanese stuff.",1366502400,,472,4.674698795180723
