New challenges face Misa, Usui and the rest from a woman-hating hypnotist who tries to get rid of the female portion of the school as well as break up the dynamic duo.  But when Misa find out, she gives him the ultimate punishment, help the girls set up the school for the open house.  Then the ladies of Maid Latte are off to the beach for a much deserved vacation, and tagging along is Aoi and Usui.  The beach house is run by the managers sister, but when they learn that she is in trouble the staff jump to the resuce making a beach house maid cafe.  ALso here is where some feelings between Usui and Misa start to surface a litte.  Then the vice president of the rich high school wishes to make a butler bistro where the maid cafe is, can Misa show up the guys that maids are better than butlers.  But the biggest problem is when a old friend of Misa's come back to town and hopes to woo her, can Usui step up and finally break the wall between him and Misa before it is too late.

The series comes to a roaring end, with all the characters you love from the first series, and some new ones as well.  It is in Japanese with subtitles, but it does not distract from the story, and i like the notes they put in the episodes that explain a little more of Japanese culture and behaviors.  Definately a good series.",1315526400,7,1367,4.163498098859316

8451220,4,B0050I9756,"I have not purchase Maid sama through Amazon but I have recently viewed maid sama. I love that series but I'm afraid the English version could have been better is the English voice actors did not do some of the characters Justice and at times the characters sounded Bland, dull or really didn't fit the character personality... I'm afraid the Japanese voice actors Maid sama Justice.. and this is where the four stars are given to normally I like the English version of Japanese anime but only if the voice actors don't sound high pitch, annoying, or uses a voice that does not fit the character's personality",1497484800,,609,4.700934579439252

8451226,5,B0050I9756,"This Show is soooo cute. Collection two consist of episodes 14-26. Even though the manga series goes further than this anime series, the show actually has an ending. Unlike most anime series that seem to just end this one gives you an actual ending. I admit that its a girl power and slightly corny show but I think overall it is a very good romantic comedy.",1349654400,,358,4.4393939393939394
