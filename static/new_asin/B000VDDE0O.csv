2936815,4,B000VDDE0O,"You've got to be kinding. No one has thought to release this on DVD yet? This is show that started it all. It was the beginning of the slew of teen shows that have invaded Fox and the WB networks for the past few years. Without Beverly Hills 90210 there would have been no Dawson's Creek, no Felicity, probably even no Buffy the Vampire Slayer, even though that one is more bizarre than the others. And if these shows are good enough and popular enough to be released on DVD, then Beverly Hills 90210, without question, should be released on DVD, as well. It would be greatly appreciated amongst the show's fans. I would also like to relive one of my favorite high school past times.",1049760000,16,683,4.428571428571429

2936848,4,B000VDDE0O,"For all practical purposes Beverly Hills 90210 is actually three different series- the high school years,the college years,and post college.
The one that made all the headlines and made TV history for Fox is generally the high school years,and this box has it all.",1207612800,,264,5.0227272727272725
2936849,5,B000VDDE0O,"Before I started college for my second year back in August of 2001, I started to watch this show faithfully again. The show was at it's best when they were in high school and in college. After they graduated college the show lost it's momentum in my opinon. I always thought that Brandon should've married Kelly or they should have killed off more characters besides Scott. All in all this was a very good show. But whatver happened to the rumored spin off where Steve was to be princpal of West Beverly ?",1207008000,,505,4.440860215053763
2936850,5,B000VDDE0O,"90210 is my favorite show of all time.  Watching the first 3 seasons takes me back to being a kid, and it was just as great watching all of the episodes a second time around.  Can't wait for season 4!",1204934400,,200,3.975
2936851,4,B000VDDE0O,"This television series was mandatory viewing for me and many other pre-teen/teenage girls during the 90's. The 'high school' seasons which effectively established it--and not incidentally also the then-start-up FOX network are all bundled together in this set.

It's just the individual box sets packaged together. Plus, there are not any extras after the original separate offerings have been released. Some of the music from the original episodes remains changed from the original airings. So this is why I (unfortunately) cannot give it the complete 5 star rating which I know this segment of this series otherwise REALLY deserves.

I swear these seasons of this show is better than vitamin c when you are having a really bad week. It takes me back to junior high and when I had posters of this series plastered all over my room.

Who can forget the very first time they saw Dylan McKay (""The Green Room"") or when Scott Scanlon accidentally blew his brains out after a period of being alienated from his once best-friend David Silver (Brian Austin Green)?

The initial plot of this series was supposed to be about an average Midwestern family attempting their best to fit into ritzy Beverly Hills after a job transfer.

But the Brenda and Dylan romance really is what cemented this series. Dylan is the brooding child of hippie Iris McKay (Stephanie Beachham) and white collar criminal Jack McKay (Josh Taylor). Jim Walsh(James Eckhouse)  is initially concerned when his 'bunnyfish' develops an interest in the alcoholic surfer, but soon sees the good underneath his troubled exterior--like wife Cindy (Carol Potter) had all along.

Brenda's new friend Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) also deals with family problems of her own. Her mother Jackie (Ann Gillespie) is a former model who seems to be ultra glamorous and hip. However, mom has a history of drug and alcohol abuse. It is hard for Kelly to be the 'parent' when she herself is trying to figure everything out--and needs guidance to do the right thing in some situations.

I think that the character whom I inadvertently ended up being the most like in high school was Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris). Andrea was obsessed with making the Beverly Blaze a hard-nosed investigative newspaper and was not a `party girl type' who had lots of money to throw around on her clothes.

In order to attend the prestigious campus, Zuckerman sleeps on a couch of her grandmothers--an admittedly 'grey area' of school residency legality for the sake of this series.

That revelation and other 'issue-oriented' episodes (such as one where Brandon discovers a girl he likes is really a teenage mom) gave the early years of this series so much more storyline depth than competitors (Saved by the Bell?) while also keeping a balance from sinking into complete over-the-top escapism and unbelievable plots.

This is all the 90210 you'll ever need.",1192579200,4,2891,5.014613778705637
2936852,5,B000VDDE0O,"90210 was one of the best shows from the 90's. While the later episodes are not as good, the earlier episodes were great. I can't wait for this season to come out on DVD December 11th!",1187827200,,184,4.138888888888889
2936853,5,B000VDDE0O,I can't wait for the 3rd season to come out.  I have the first and second season.  I really can't wait to see the whole Brenda going off to Paris with Donna and meeting that hot superman guy and Dylan and Kelly getting together those were my favorite episodes.  I have to admit though I also really liked the Emily Valentine episodes in the 2nd season. Breaking up is hard to do :),1186704000,,381,4.191780821917808

2936855,5,B000VDDE0O,"Seasons 1 and 2 were a great start to a show that has stood the test of time, but Season 3 is when they really started to hit their stride. This of course features the beginning of the most important storylines in the whole series. Dylan/Brenda/Kelly love triangle, Dylans dad gets blown up which sets up the most intriguing storyline of them all as Dylan will set off on a roller coaster ride the next 2 and a half years trying to deal with it. Brandon begins to show the leadership quality that would lead him through college and the real world. Andrea sets off into a recurring theme, not being able to finish anything she starts. Steve gets into some major trouble (which will also be a recurring theme) and nearly misses graduation because of it. David deals with trying to graduate early with his friends, and copes with the consequences of that. Just a fantastic season. Basically this season to the point where Dylan leaves early on in Season 6 is the golden age of the series.",1185580800,2,985,4.5083798882681565

The best character is Brenda (which is why I stopped watching the show when she left). I think the show was most exciting when she was on it. After she left I just couldn't get into it.

On virtually ALL of the Dawson Creek DVDs (all seasons) the songs are different (most) -  Like R.E.M. is removed, even the famous starting credits by Paula Cole (""I don't wanna wait"") were removed from Season 2 on!

I cant wait till it comes on DVD.

I did some research, and came up with that it won't be out on DVD anytime soon due to copyright problems, and furthermore, when FOX and its other companies that produced 90210 tried to come up with other ways around it, no one wanted to actually do the work of taking out the music, because it takes away from the show. The same is with Melrose Place. It is sad, because the longer FOX waits, the lower the profits. I guess this is what POOR MANAGEMENT looks like. Perhaps a MANAGMENT representative can explain all the dumb shows, and really old shows that have no actor or actress existence around anymore cause they are dead, come on JUST RELEASE THE SHOW ALREADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!",1142985600,2,753,4.626865671641791
2937031,5,B000VDDE0O,"I, like all 250 of us who have written reviews here wondering when we will get our OFFICIAL releases of the series on DVD, have been Googling my little heart out looking for answers. Today I opened an offer for a free Netflix trial and decided to search their site for any version of 90210. To my surprise a listing for the complete first season popped up, but not being a member I wasn't able to see ordering info or further details so I called customer service. They looked on imdb.com (a movie info website) and told me it came up as being released. However, it didn't show a release date or where to get copies. When I looked it up on that site, I only saw what looked like a very detailed accounting of all 10 seasons, complete with episode titles, cast, and air dates - but no sign of release.

  I have heard a theory that the reason for the hold-up on the DVD release is that the producers did not acquire the rights for all the music (songs played on episodes) for DVD distribution. They only had rights for TV, so knowing how many songs were featured in each episode btwn the jukebox at the Peach Pit and the live music at the After Dark, etc., I guess they have their work cut out for them. Still, it's been 6 years and we are aching for those DVD's.

After I had my weekly dose of Beverly Hills, 90210. I couldn't wait for the next day to discuss with my own close friends, the happenings of my TV friends at West Beverly Hills High School. I used to talk about them like I knew them. I did in a way, I grew up with them. As they matured, so did I. I watched them graduate, then I graduated. I watched them enter college, then I entered college. They were in crazy relationships and so was I. LOL

Seriously this show follows the lives of a close knit group of friends that spanned a decade. Not many shows can say that. It's sure to leave a lasting impression on all who watch.

I was so pleased to learn the series would finally released on DVD. I'm looking forward to it!",1123891200,2,864,4.130952380952381

I heard that they can't release it because they need to get permission from all the music artists on the show.  My opinion is, take the music out if you need to!

Surely the inability of fans to be able to get a copy of 90210 on DVD will see a diminishing interest in the release the longer time goes by.

There was no point for them to start producing the seasons if they were going to lose the property. Secondly, unlike The OC where the featured bands sign DVD contracts ahead of time, the bands featured at the Peach Pit After Dark signed no such thing. The bands want too much money to have their material released on DVD. If you're a fan of the show, you know how many songs they used. From the overplayed R.E.M.in the first couple of seasons, to the more obnoxious bands at the PPAD. I'm sure whoever picks up the rights to this show will get them into production soon.

Although I LOVE Saved by The Bell, it didn't cover half of the topics expressed on 90210. Not to mention, this show had a successful run on FOX!

90210 had such a big following-people born in many different generations followed 90210. A lot of us grew up on 90210!

I cant believe that its now 2004 and 90210 ended in 2000 and they still haven't released it due to liabiliy/legal/music rights problems.... if the music was on 90210 weren't they giving 90210 their rights to air them on tv- which they were probably paid for and in turn 90210 made money from all of us watching the show.  So, whats the problem? Aaron Spelling isn't getting any younger & he needs to hurry up and get with the program & release 90210 on DVDS, or maybe (fingers crossed), bring back 90210 on tv!! i wish!!!

I have seen virtually episode, and to this day, many of my friends and I spend weekend mornings watching reruns on the FX Network.  I would most CERTAINLY buy ANY season of ""Bev-niner"" on DVD, and would buy additional copies as gifts for my fellow Niner-junkie friends.  I can't believe that ""Saved By the Bell: The College Years"" has THREE SEASONS out on DVD while not a single season of 90210 has been released yet.

Apparently, Lions Gate Entertainment does not have the clearance to do a complete season set of 90210. There're some licensing and legal issues involved with Spelling Entertainment. However, they are so far able to sign off the Pilot episode (around 90min., released on 15-Jun-2004). Furthermore, lots of episodes featured pop & rock songs that will introduce a huge music rights costs. I believe Lions Gate is working hard to resolve the issues. As a big fan of 90210, keep seeing other ""not-so-popular"" TV series DVD sets coming out and still not 90210 really upset me and make me jealous, but hopefully time & patience will eventually bring us the ulitmate reward --- Beverly Hills 90210 First Complete Season DVD Set.

Brandon worked in the Peach Pit at the same time I was working in a fast food resturant, and just like him I was saving for a car too. I found Dylans character to be interesting, him being somewhat of an ""outcast"" even though he is very smart. Some of my favorite episodes are when Brandon's ex girlfriend from Minnesota visits him in califonia, and finds ways to sneak into his room late at night. This was a very entertaining show. Please release it on DVD, and make it a good picture transfer complete with all the original music. I would also love to have some cast commentaries on the DVD's, even if only for a few of the shows.

I will definitely be the first in line to purchase all seasons when they come out. (Whenever that is) There really isn't anything on T.V. nowadays that have the same appeal as 90210 had when it was on T.V. My vote for 90210 on DVD is here!!!!",1075248000,,427,4.618421052631579
2937447,5,B000VDDE0O,"Like many other gen-xers I came of age with this series which helped the pre-teen marketing machine rebound from declining New Kids on the Block popularity. This same series was also responsible for catapulting the Fox network into competition with the then-big three (ABC, CBS, and NBC) of broadcasting networks.
Initially centering around the requsite transition period of a strait-laced midwestern Walsh family after Jim Walsh receives an involuntary tranfer to his firm's LA branch, the series revolved around fraternal twins Brenda (Shannen Doherty) and Brandon's (Jason Priestly Walsh)adventures with their new found friends.
Their friends had a far more permissive home life, but the Walshes soon learned these same people had less than stellar personal demons they were working (or not)through. Between Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth)'s drunk/formerly coke-addicted mom and Dylan McKay (Luke Perry)'s own drinking in an attempt to forget his bitter family battles, this series is busting with juicy conflict.
Despite being produced by Aaron Spelling (whose daughter Tori convieniently is part of the cast as Donna Martin) it is an excellent addition to your DVD library. Their litany of personal problems does not prevent any member of 'the gang' from being portrayed as a likeable and three-dimensional person (very rare for ""soap"" programs) if only given the chance.
Additionally Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris)is the book-smart editor of the award winning Beverly Blaze, but she is attending the prestigious West Beverly High under dubious pretenses. In order to receive a quality public education, Andrea sleeps on the couch of her Grandma Rose who IS a district resident. When she is almost exposed by (ironically) an award opportunity, all of the girls bond together to redecorate her sleeping area to resemble a teen girl's hangout.
Luke Perry and Jason Priestly no longer incite mob riots with their personal appearances, but this series is a must own for any gen-xer. Fox is shortchanging itself until it releases the series out on DVD.",1074384000,56,2055,5.365325077399381

I am not saying this just as a fan: a series that lasted for 10 years, defined a generation and was in lots of countries around the world (for example France is showing re-runs now) deserves a DVD release.",1073520000,2,512,4.4

The episode where Dylan loses his father in an explosion culminated at the same time I lost my 26 year old brother Ricky in a freak accident.  I was in my senior year of high school the same as Dylan McKay and the trivial pursuits of daily life in high school didn't interest me anymore.  Graduation meant nothing to me.  It was a very bittersweet time.  The one line that stuck with me and comforted me came from David Silver when Dylan was about to take a drink....""You can't run from what's in your mind.""  I cannot thank this series enough because in a time of absolute grief and uncertainty, I found solace and comfort in this series.  I am the class of '93.

Brenda and Brandon Walsh are two down-to-earth teens from Minnesota who move to Beverly Hills, California with their parents to begin a new life.  Their friends are children of the celebrity, spoiled upper-class.  Each episode is based on the relationships between the kids, their parents and, that behind closed doors, there is a lot more pain in their lives then what outsiders looking in judge as a privileged life.  As the series evolves, you see that these kids are not much different than most teens in the country---except, of course, the price of their cars.  Brandon is the only one who actually gets a job to pay for his wheels, even if it is a classic Mustang.
I have watched this show in reruns over the years but somehow always manage to miss the pilot eisode.  After about couple of years of absentia, 90210 is back on the FX cable channel weekdays at 9 am.
