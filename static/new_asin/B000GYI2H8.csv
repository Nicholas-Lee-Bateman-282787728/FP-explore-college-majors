8135279,4,B000GYI2H8,"If the love of baseball runs through your blood and you want to see a broader view on how the game viewed in a different part of the world you would enjoy this movie. It is true that the subtitles can be cumbersome, but if you can get past that then I would recommend this movie. I believe that part of the reason that we Americans love baseball is that it embodies many virtues that we carry with us in our lives. As culture has changed so has the way we have viewed the game. Some of it for the better.....some of it for the worse. In any case, the virtues of hard work, team work, persistence, overcoming adversity and other virtues are still on full display in the great game of baseball. This movie shows the Japanese culture's respect for these virtuous lesson's through the mundane way they prepare for an all important Country Wide High School Baseball Tournament. Players getting up at predawn hours to get to practice is just one small example. The various conversations and interviews with the players and the coaches shows a pure love of the game and the high drama that ensues when a young man is faced with the conclusion of his High School Baseball career. The player and coach reflections as the end the end draws near are poignant and nice moments. My favorite moment in the film is when one coach announces the roster for his team for the tournament and selects the last player on the roster....the player has nominal skill but a great work ethic. The praise from the coach and the sincere reaction from the player were the highlights of the movie for me. This movie is not for everyone...but if you love the game...you would enjoy adding this movie to your collection.",1277337600,,1687,4.516339869281046
8135280,5,B000GYI2H8,"If you want to understand Japan and the Japanese people, watch this DVD. It will teach you how a Japanese mind works a lot better than any lengthy book written by scholars on Japanese culture; moreover, it will do so a lot more enjoyably.",1188259200,,238,4.431818181818182
8135281,5,B000GYI2H8,"I saw the last half of this on TV last summer, I thought it was really interesting how they used baseball to relate the culture of America to Japan.  Really, it was just a story about high school baseball in Japan, but in their dedication and hard work you can see the values that define the Japanese culture.  It was dramatic and emotionally moving in parts, and that was one thing I really liked about it.  It sends a heartfelt message to the viewer and that is what made me want to buy it to see the whole film.",1174348800,2,514,4.171717171717172
8135282,4,B000GYI2H8,"A revealing peek into Japanese High School ball. The importance of the National Tournament there is more like hoop ""March Madness"" here. Their passion for the game is a marvel, as is the dedication and work ethic of the kids and coaches. After watching this film, it is no small wonder Japan won the 1st World Baseball Classic. Could have been edited with more drama from some of the games, but a nice film capturing the passion for the Tournament and its impact on all involved.",1173571200,,479,4.5813953488372094
8135283,5,B000GYI2H8,"I loved the way the movie followed the passion of the 2 very different teams, and how they each dealt with elimination in very different ways.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to gain new insights into the heart of baseball in Japan.  High school baseball is not life or death in Japan -- it is bigger than that.  Well done!",1167868800,2,336,4.301587301587301
8135284,5,B000GYI2H8,"Being a huge sports fan, I've seen a lot of sports documentaries in my life but this is one of the best I've ever seen.  In my opinion, Kokoyakyu is better than even Hoop Dreams, and I think Hoop Dreams is a great, great film.  Kokoyakyu captures the essence of not only Japanese sports, but Japanese society as well.

You'll find yourself rooting for the two teams featured in this film, especially the team with the always supportive and energetic kantoku (head coach/manager).  If this movie doesn't move you to tears in the end, then you need to check your pulse.

This is a must-see for all baseball fans, but casual sports fans will enjoy it as well.",1163030400,4,656,4.52542372881356
