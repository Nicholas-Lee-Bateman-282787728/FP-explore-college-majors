Kay Francis fans; you need to get this DVD.",1326672000,,241,4.431818181818182
8243973,5,B00125OLKC,"One of the documentaries in the DVD, Psychological and Rehabilitation in World War II, is the one that John Huston made of war veterans who were suffering from what we now call Post-trumatic Stress Syndrome, titled Let There be Light. The men profiled are not actors and agreed to have their treatment and group psychotherapy sessions filmed.  It is truly amazing to see the psychiatrists work with these men;  the hypnosis and sodium pentathal treatments are used on men who have developed stuttering, an inability to walk (psychosomatic), etc.  The psychiatrist who works with the men in group psychotherapy clearly has Freudian training and it is incredible to see him help the men understand that their reaction to the trauma of war was in some instances related to fears stemming back to their childhood.  The film, by the way, is narrated by John Huston's father, the wonderful actor, Walter Huston.

The background story of this documentary is equally interesting.  It was banned for viewing as it was thought to show the side of war that the miliary did not want seen.  They argued that the film should not be released for public viewing to protect the privacy of the men, who in fact wanted it released because of the benefit they had received. If you are able to get a copy of John Huston's autobiography, An Open Book, he goes into great detail about his admiration for both the mean and the doctors.",1300838400,,1411,4.7818930041152266
