From back of DVD: ""Cliff Jacobson has spent most of his life mastering the fine points of wilderness camping. His apprenticeship began at age 11 at a rustic scout camp set deep in the Michigan woods. It was 1951, before the days of nylon, fleece and Gore-Tex. He didn't have much money, and neither did his friends - so instead of ""buying things"" they relied on skills... skills to make fire when the woods were soaked from rain; skills to rig tents so they wouldn't blow down in the wind.

In this DVD, you will learn the forgotten skills that have kept him warm and dry on his wilderness trips. You'll learn how to tell a good tent from a bad one, and to make any tent more resistant to wind and rain. Discover how to:

Rig single and double rain tarps
Tie essential knots
Choose and use edged tools
Make a one match fire in the rain
And more!

One of North America's most respected outdoors writers and wilderness guides brings you this eye-opening look at the expert skills you shouldn't be without!""",1493942400,,1141,4.519417475728155
