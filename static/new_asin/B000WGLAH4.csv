8223212,1,B000WGLAH4,"The IMDB description and the DVD opening credits state that this is a Technicolor film.  Perhaps the original 1954 print is Technicolor; however, this Amazon version is plain old inglorious black & white!  The IMDB description states the length as 165 minutes; Amazon says 103 minutes; the actual run time of the DVD is 105 minutes.  It seems that almost a whole hour has disappeared from the original ...  Also, this copy is very poor.  Seems like it's a copy of a copy of a copy; and the sound isn't all that great.  That's just the technical stuff.  The packaging is downright tacky -- a plain, transparent plastic case with a stick on label and bar code -- no dvd case jacket.

The ""history"" is so compressed and ""dumbed down"" as to make it seem like an extended comic sketch.  The only redeeming scene, in my opinion, is Edith Piaf climbing the entrance gate and singing ""Ah! Ca Ira"" ...

I supppose I need to pay more attention to others' reviews before I decide to purchase -- ""Once burnt, twice smart.""",1334534400,2,1010,4.530386740331492
8223213,3,B000WGLAH4,"Versaille is fablous but NOT IN BLACK AND WHITE. I paid just under $23 for the DVD and was dreadfully disappointed because the movie was supposed to be and actually said ""In Technicolor"" and the whole thing was in BLACK AND WHITE. It was as if someone made a copy of the movie in B&W and was selling that one. It wasn't as fabulous in black and white and I don't like it nor want it that way. I'm about to return it for a credit to my account. So for this review, I will say no more.",1302825600,,483,3.938775510204082

  I saw this film in the fifties and enjoyed it greatly.  It was in colour and with French dialogue.  This version is in black-and-white (although the credits mention technicolour) and is dubbed.  The magic has gone.  Is it not possible to obtain the technicolour & French language version ?",1235520000,8,531,7.898305084745763
8223215,5,B000WGLAH4,"This film is a treasure. From the building of Versailles when Louis the 14th became a king in the 17th through Louis the 15th, 16th, the revolution and Napoleon the 1st, the 1rdu and the 1st world war to the museum it is today!! You will learn all abot France, Versailles and the famous people : writers ( Moliere, Corneille..) ministers, queens (marie antoinette..)and mistresses...It is amazing and great even for kids. Great decors as it is filmed inside Versailles. Great actors, the best french actors in the 50's : Edith Piaf is even singing the Marseillaise!! Orson Welles is participating. It is the Film to have if interested in French culture, easy access. Guitry did also a Napoleon, and a Paris movie. It is colored by the way!!!",1204848000,2,741,4.751937984496124
8223216,1,B000WGLAH4,"Sach Guitry was the son of France's most illustrious actor and the godson of Sarah Bernhardt. As such, he had access to the historical sites and costumes reserved for the finest museums, opulence the common tourist could never see on their own. Some of his films are like what could have happened if Preston Sturges had devoted himself to making historical epics. They're elegant and cheeky, fast paced, silly and entirely over dressed.
This is a terrific and gorgeous historical film being sold here by AMAZON as a shoddy DV-R with no packaging and a stick on label. It  features a murky black and white transfer of what appears to be a pan&scan vhs tape from a faded print. I'm returning it without watching it. I'd rather remember how beautiful those fireworks looked over the fountains at Versailles in the beautiful color print I saw and not mess around with this ugly desecration!",1203033600,18,886,4.790849673202614
