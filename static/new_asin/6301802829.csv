7915633,5,6301802829,This was an excellent tele-movie.  A shame it isn't available to the  masses on DVD.  And that it hasn't been given the Hollywood treatment that it so richly  deserves!!!,1522195200,,170,4.758620689655173
7915634,4,6301802829,"Of all the movie versions of the intriging story, this 1980's version is my favorite. Wonderfully twist of a female as the main character. Creepy not scary.  Creepy is a good thing!",1376179200,,181,4.65625
7915635,3,6301802829,"Belinda Bauer (Airwolf and Robocop II) and Anthony Perkins of Psycho fame star in this modern version of Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray story. Bauer is both beautiful and monstrous as a fashion model on the rise to superstardom. Through the years, everyone around her grows old and tired. Everyone except Dorian. Dorian is as gorgeous as ever. Gorgeous and haunted. Dorian never ages, but her screen test does. Her sins are adding up and it's getting ugly.
The climax is a true creep out.
Here's hoping it gets released on DVD soon.",1212796800,5,527,4.739130434782608
