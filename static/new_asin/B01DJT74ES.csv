7713203,5,B01DJT74ES,The most realistic portrayal of mania I've ever seen in the media. Inspiring for all.,1464134400,7,85,4.733333333333333
7713204,5,B01DJT74ES,"My partner and I saw this movie together in a local theater, and both of us fell in love with it. As a person who has a Bipolar I diagnosis, I saw bits of myself in both Carla (Katie Holmes' character) and Marco (Luke Kirby's character). Parts of this movie made me crave mania, and other parts of it reminded me of the destructive consequences that can result from decisions made while manic. My partner came away from this movie with a better understanding of my experience, and it was an excellent conversation starter for us. The way this movie portrays Bipolar I is, in my opinion, frighteningly accurate. I would disagree with the reviewer who says that this movie raises the question of whether bipolar disorder is a gift or an illness. I think it sends a very clear message that both exist in tension--it isn't either/or. My only slight criticism is that it implies all instances of mania are due to medication noncompliance, which is untrue and may lead viewers with bipolar loved ones to believe that the presence of symptoms automatically means noncompliance. But I'm still giving it five stars because it is the best mental illness movie I have ever seen.",1461196800,38,1167,4.697560975609756
7713205,3,B01DJT74ES,"""Touched With Fire"" (original title: ""Mania Days""; 2016 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Carla (played by Katie Holmes) and Marco (played by Luke Kirby). As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Fall"", and we see Carla giving a poetry reading (from her book ""Faded"") at a book store. Meanwhile, we see Marco arguing with his dad about the sloppy/sorry state of Marco's apartment, having decided to go not just off the grid, but ""off society"" altogether. It isn't long before both Carla and Marco end up in a psych ward. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is written, directed, scored and co-edited by Paul Dalio, for me previously unknown. Dalio takes the real-life book ""Touched With Fire"" by Kay Jamison, which explores the ties (if any) between artistic genius and bipolar disorder, and weaves it into a fictional tale of two artistic-leaning people who like ships in the night find each other by happenstance, and strike a special bond (or do they?). The central question throughout the movie: is being bipolar a gift or an illness? Along the way, we see the two main performers (Holmes and Kirby, the latter reminding me physically of Mark Ruffalo) give it all they can with the material at hand. Unfortunately, while the movie is well-intended, it falls short of compelling viewing. We should be emotionally invested, but for whatever reason I wasn't for most of this. Only towards the very end did I get a sense of what-might-have-been. One of the better side aspects of the movie is the mostly minimalist score, composed by the director himself. At the very end of the movie, Dalio leaves us with this dedication: ""For my wife, who shed light on this cold and dark stone"", wow.

This movie was filmed in Spring 2013, and just now reaches gets a theatrical release. It's frankly a miracle it made it to the big screen at all. The movie played briefly some weeks ago at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended very well, and I wasn't surprised this disappeared after only one week. If you have a particular interest in either the movie's subject matter or the main performers, I'd say this is worth checking out, warts and all, be it on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion regarding ""Touched With Fire"".",1459209600,17,2426,4.71933962264151

7713207,2,B01DJT74ES,"Its 2017 why can't we have a movie depicting people with bipolar disorder that take their medication. Every story is different and I know the director drew from his own experience. I have bipolar and I am an artist was diagnosed at 14  I take my medications everyday and track my moods. I have a great relationship with my family. Yes i have crazy stuff happen sometimes when I'm manic but it's well managed. There are two characters with the illness not one of them could have it together. Instead it was the cliche story we have all seen. If i had seen this when I was in high school I would have be a crushed a bit.

I found the whole abortion plot line disheartening especially since the child was wanted they had already painted the nursery.  There is at least a 50% chance their child would not even have bipolar disorder. ( I am sure my personal views cloud this viewpoint)  I guess would have preferred a plot line of carla leaving him.

 I just could not relate to the story aspects of the illness yes",1494460800,,1010,4.345744680851064

7713211,5,B01DJT74ES,"What's it like to be bipolar and a creative genius? The first part Marco (Luke Kirby) claims can't truly be known if you don't have the illness. Yet Paul Dalio, explicates it, likely clearer than anyone before, in this exceptional film. The second part, the creative genius piece, Dalio demonstrates through his skillful writing, directing, the stunning acting by a top-notch cast, the exquiste cinematography (Kristina Nikolova and Alexander Stanishev) and adept editing (Paul Dalio and Lee Percy). And he, Dalio, even composes the impressive congruent score. The filming accomplishes some extraordinary results, sometimes utilizing ordinary objects and compositions enlivened with just-right color and lighting. The British film director, David Lean, maintained that in good cinematography, one should be able to cut out any frame, throw a picture frame around it, and hang it on a wall. That's often the case here.  Back to the acting: I saw Luke Kirby in ""Take This Waltz,"" and became an instant fan. I also, have to admit, was struck by his singular and fabulous delivery, in that piece, of one of the sexiest monologues in film.  Katie Holmes, who plays the other lead, Carla, stuns, as the  published poet who's also bipolar, she mesmerized by the sun, as Marco (dba ""Luna"") is by the moon. Her performance is brilliant. All the acting is. Christine Lahte is authentic and inspired in the role of Carla's mom. A consummate actor, her performance in ""Out of the Ashes"" is memorable. The viewer connects early on with Marco's dad (Griffin Dunne), who is struggling to remain calm as he listens to Marco's wildly unreasonable rationale for giving up his job, no longer requiring utilities or money for food. Forgive all the superlatives, but the film is that good, delivering a fascinating multi-dimensional picture, not solely of the illness, but equally of 2 amazing characters who have it. I leave the rest of the narrative to you, in an effort not to spoil. Highly recommend!",1490486400,7,1983,5.058103975535168

7713234,3,B01DJT74ES,This could have been so much better. I think the characters were like caricatures and did not explore the true depth of being an artist and being bipolar.

7713295,4,B01DJT74ES,"A single hour and 46 minute *rush* of Bipolar perspective, in movie adaptation, for those unfamiliar with the psychotic lifestyle-experience. I can understand the mania and depression at points in the movie's plot, however the lifestyle portrayal is compressed (dramatized) into convenient movie format for your viewing convenience. If you enjoy book format, I highly (highly) recommend reading the book (same title, authored by Kay Jamison, Ph. D., also with Bipolar diagnosis) FIRST, BEFORE seeing this movie.

Basically, the male character educates the film audience about Bipolar through his dialog, lifestyle, and relationships. And, it's a love story (for appeal) and added drama. To its credit, ""Touched with Fire"" is an independent film, and film festival winner, and recorded natively in English dialog.

The way the movie has an interstitial that simulates depression: time passes in a void of sleep and sadness, weird dreams, lifelessness, self hate, hopelessness, helplessness, and loathing. The movie is overall sad, and unresolved, and all too true of Bipolar experience, which is why my eyes were teary through almost the entire second half.

It is important for the general public to see Bipolar and its unique characteristics enacted through plot and characterization. In common parlance, you may hear someone (without a diagnosis) say, ""I am having a 'Bipolar' day,"" etc., to explain various mixed events or emotions. That is similar to how someone else might reference A.D.D. (Attention Deficit, without diagnosis) by saying, ""I was feeling 'A.D.D.' at work this morning before my lunch break,"" to connote being very busy and feeling unfocused.

Overall, we MUST recognize and appreciate that people with Bipolar (as with certain other diagnosable conditions) do see the world differently, and DO therefore contribute greatly to our society, and DO increase our collective standard of living for better. Much highly valuable, prized, and praised art, music, entertainment, science, creativity, intellectualism, muse, and discovery do come from people with Bipolar, AND their immense work is also attributable to Bipolar. People with Bipolar can make tremendous contributions for many, many people at large. However, those suffering with Bipolar also pay a price, as they live decidedly more difficult lives, punctuated with pure havoc of emotional distress. Even clinicians will agree that bouts with Bipolar depression can be far worse and more mentally and physically taxing and impairing than many types of physical ailments.

In the spirit of the book and the film, to create a point of reference for interacting in daily life with people who have (or could possibly have) Bipolar mania or depression... just extend to them (especially, though also everyone, in general) your compassion, patience, and understanding. Common Sense: get to know someone well, before judging him or her; and better yet: just try *not* to judge other people in the first place. Help people to whatever degree you can, and ensure, positively, that you are more of a help than a hindrance. We're kind of all in this whole ""life thing"" together. Live well, appreciate others, and coexist.

Other: The author of the book (""Touched with Fire"") is in the movie as herself, which I think is an odd ('unique' at best) cameo. Four (of 5 possible) stars because the story is unresolved, dramatized, and stereotyped. Perhaps another movie will demonstrate how to more positively interact with Bipolar people.

Dr. Jamison is the tenured Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and suffers from Bipolar Disorder herself. She is also an influential and knowledgeable author of several novels including her phenomenal debut work: An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness. This novel first explained the illness in detail while bravely using her own experiences to tell her tale. Kay Redfield Jamison is a flawless author of Bipolar Disorder and this film is an attempt to put the notion of creativity on the big screen I have read Touched with Fire and would highly recommend the book. Whenever a film is made about mental illness, I feel it is always necessary for to view as it can begin a conversation and this is so very important. This work is worthy of this if not for the more than superior portrayals of the affected persons and families

Carla is a poet who had trouble reaching her audience during a poetry reading while they sat awkwardly motionless. She questions her mother, Sara (Christine Lahti) about what is behind her illness. Unprepared to fully explain it, she suggests she continue her medicine and see her psychiatrist which eventually leads her to sign herself into a psych hospital. Marco is also a poet of the rapping type who leads a life feeling like his life is steered by the moon thus he calls himself Luna. Marco believes the apocalypse is upon us. His father, George (Griffin Dunne) visits him only to see he is living in a huge mess with books opened for reading everywhere along with his power shut off. He is not able to use his healthy mind but is delusional in his beliefs. Carla and Marco meet in the hospital and quickly begin triggering each other until their respective manias reach the breaking point of psychosis.

While they are up each and every night unattended, they are doing things together believing that they are from other planets, stacking chairs to the sky and building objects from forks. It is not that I don't believe that mania can and, at times, does escalate to psychosis because it most definitely can; it is the situations shown while in a secure psychiatric hospital that had me questioning the aforementioned. There are no using forks unless they are plastic and while under supervision. There is no running around during the night hours and certainly not unattended. A psychiatric hospital is a safe place where people go to get help for their illness(es) and to feel better. I kept questioning why the staff didn't seem to' notice their manias climbing to dangerous levels during the day too, at group sessions, or personal therapy. Even the staff should have been charting their behavior around the clock.

Personally, I felt many will relate more so to Carla and Marco before they check into, and after they are out of, the hospital. They are still acting out towards their parents, society, life in general, and still are very manic while refusing any treatment. They are a couple in love by now and while lacking insight are trying different extremely risky behaviors together. Both are continuing to discount help from medication (which can be another issue with Bipolar Disorder).  Dr. Kay Jamison adds a cameo role as a clinician who tries to explain to the couple that medication treatment will not stifle their creative nature. There are a lot of people who would pivot to the contrary, though.

At a point, their personal experiences change drastically and they are forced to either take the medicines and begin treatment or change their situation. What becomes necessary, and also is very factual about Bipolar Disorder, is the personal decision to take the reins of their own illnesses and with a singular focus - fight for their own health. If both people in the couple are not completely committed to their own recovery, a relationship will not be able to get off of the ground without the same cycling behaviors. The performances by the parents are wonderful as they support their grown children and I was very impressed by their attitudes of genuine concern. 'A good effort by writer - director Paul Dalio (who also suffers from Bipolar Disorder) to show extreme mania in Bipolar Disorder 1. This movie should reach several people and many will identify with it.",1466640000,6,4621,4.843037974683544
7713300,3,B01DJT74ES,"All the actors did a great job in this film. Katy Holmes as Carla, Luke Kirby as Marco. Christine Lahti as Carla's mother. Everyone else did a great job.
I liked this movie but there was something missing, I don't know what. I found myself agreeing with Marco in many cases. The world IS way overpopulated & human beings Are like a virus, making the earth sick. He was also right about his assessment of the psychiatrist in the psychiatric hospital. Her face did look dead, dull, boring. He wanted to hook her up to jumper cables to give her some energy. I thought she looked dead, too.
I did Not like how Carla was tricked into signing herself into the psychiatric ward. That type of thing is what makes people with brain disorders mistrust the psychiatric community. She did need help. But I am not convinced that being locked up is a good thing.
I agree with one reviewer in that it's unlikely patients would be allowed to run around at night, building a pyramid of chairs to reach the moon. Nor do I think that metal forks would be available to paitients. I've never been hospitalized but that did seem put in for drama.
The depiction of manias was realistic in this movie. Trying to write even after the pen goes out of ink, talking a mile a minute, becoming delirious with joy. I've been there.
I was diagnosed with manic-depression/bipolar disorder at age 46. But I self-diagnosed at age 15, while reading a biography of Lord Byron. I told my father ""Dad, this is what I have. It's called manic-depression."" My father said ""You're not crazy. You're just a poet.""
All my life, I've had periods of Zero sleep (my parents said I never slept as a baby). I'd be up all night, painting, writing, drawing, walking for miles & miles, trying to wear myself out so I could sleep. I once heard a voice telling me to go climb a particular tree to get a message from the moon on how to cause world peace. So I should have been hospitalized but my husband helped me find a psychiatrist/GP/neurologist team who got  me onto good meds. It took 5 years to find the right meds (lithium damaged my liver so that is out for me).
I often miss the super manias, during which I'd finish a painting in one night. Majoring in Fine Arts, professors told me I was the most creative student they had ever had. But it took me 7 years to get my 3 degrees, due to falling horribly physically ill after super manias each Spring. So I was put in the ""normal people"" hospital with high fevers, strep throat & other ailments.
Back to the movie, sorry for the digression. I thought it was unreal that Kay Redfield Jamison would meet with two unknown people. You can't even email her at Johns Hopkins. I'm glad she was in the movie but it just didn't seem real that she'd agree to meet Carla & Marco.
And she said in her scene that your creativity isn't damaged by taking medications. I can no longer draw or paint (altho' I can still write poetry & have had many poems published in literary journals). I desperately miss painting! So I disagree with that. I love Kay R-Jamison, have been helped by reading her many books. But that part didn't ring true (for me).
One silly thing that bothered me in this movie was the mother shaving Carla's legs in a bath-tub. My mother is an RN. She taught us to Never shave our legs in a tub, you can get a UTI that way.
The movie depicted the manias really well. The fact that Marco was living in a huge mess, surrounded by random objects, books opened ""for easy reference"" was so believable. Carla & Marco falling madly in love was actually beautiful to me. Why shouldn't people with brain disorders fall in love? I wish they could have stayed together. It was kind of sad seeing Carla & Marco reading their poems at the end, a let-down from the powerful energies they'd had before. But it's so hard to exist in ""the real world"" if you aren't on good meds.
I disagree with one review, that the film-maker sold out to the pharm industry. Right now, there is no better treatment other than medications. I did cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy, primal scream therapy, extreme exercise therapy (running up the side of a mountain every day, at the behest of my therapist). I pray, play flute, dance, go for hikes. Did regular ""talk therapy."" Nothing calmed the manias until I began taking the combo of meds I am taking (for over 20 years now).
I hate the side effects (weight gain, being slower thinking, less creative). But until the scientific community comes up with better treatment, I will keep taking the meds.
A movie that I felt did a better job of depicting manic depression was ""Infinitely Polar Bear.""",1466467200,13,4620,4.480427046263345
7713301,5,B01DJT74ES,I watched this movie right after I saw an interview with Paul Dalio. He's quite an amazing person! I have family members who are bipolar so I can relate to his life story as well as the movie. I thought it was powerful and very moving. Bipolar can be extremely challenging to live with and this movie showed not only the hard parts but how they dealt with the disorder and learned to live their lives positively. The way bipolar brains function is so interesting and they have so much to offer...the challenge is figuring out how to channel all their thoughts and energy without loosing their very special sense of self and the movie portrayed that beautifully.,1466467200,4,661,4.610169491525424
7713302,2,B01DJT74ES,"I must say I was disappointed with this film. As I am bipolar, this shows only the extreme case with psychosis involved.

7713308,3,B01DJT74ES,"While some of the depictions of the mania & depression rang true the whole hospital stay was unrealistic. In my experience, patients are not allowed to roam around out of bed at night and certainly not without supervision. The other thing that was really silly was the sequence when they were running around building whatever it was and they pulled a bunch of metal forks out of the drawer. I've only seen plastic being used and that again, was supervised...I don't know how long they were supposedly in the hospital (it seemed like a decent amount of time) but it seems like the meds would have kicked in before they got so whipped up into a manic frenzy and wouldn't the doctors have noticed they were still acting so hyper (because when you're manic its not just at night so the staff should have seen the signs) and upped the dose or sedated them more? I know its just a movie and they have to dramatize things to keep it interesting but I found the hospital stuff took me out of the movie rather than draw me into it. And the patients in the hospital were a little hokey too.

I also agree with the reviewer that said there's nothing romantic about this illness. Failed relationships, abandoned jobs, the inability to get out of bed or the crazed notion that you should shave your head are more likely than some sweet romantic bonding off meds.

It was a decent movie but at times over dramatized.",1465862400,5,1402,4.4941176470588236

It's just that the way the movie began, I never felt a connection with either character or much of a sense of who they were besides the fact that they were bipolar and both in a manic phase.  And from that perspective, it was tough to ""know"" either character, so the empathy tended to be more with the concerned parents who were trying to find them help, or the weary doctor who sat up trying to help Katie's character make sense of her life, despite the fact that she wasn't thinking rationally.  More of an ""outside looking in"" perspective, which got long in this movie.

7713315,4,B01DJT74ES,"Touched With Fire stars Katie Holmes (Batman Begins) as Carla Lucia, a manic-depressive poet who struggles to recall what she was like before her illness took hold. Marco (Mambo Italiano) is off his medication and incessantly draws chalk images of the moon across New York City as he babbles about imminent apocalypse. When they are both checked into the same mental institution, there is instant chemistry between them, but their combined bipolar disorders swing them from incredible highs to tormented lows.

Director Paul Dalio is himself bipolar, and the films message is that the ailment is not dehumanizing. He goes even further, proposing that a chemical imbalance is something to be nurtured, not cured. His exploration of the links among manic depression, creativity, and romance is often fascinating, though his celebration often seems excessive. Would these two young people really be better off in a world of their own, subject to drastic mood swings? Could a serious relationship really endure?

Dalio alternates between reality and fantasy. In one sequence, Carla and Marco spin around blissfully in a Van Gogh Starry Night painting as snowflakes made of sequins fall. In another, they scream uncontrollably, lost in a fog of confused mania. There are harrowing scenes of patients being dragged away in a hospital, kicking, fighting, and screaming. Other scenes show acting-out behavior in other ways, notably hurling objects across the room. Language is pretty strong as well.

Ms. Holmes turns in what may be her best screen performance. She shows an impressive range of emotions and is particularly effective at portraying Carlas unbridled passion, not only for romance, but for life in general. The contrast between these scenes and those in which Carla withdraws into herself and transforms into an unrecognizable alternate self is a remarkable piece of acting.

The ultimate message of the film is that many great artists may have had what we now call bipolar disorder, their manic highs resulting in great works of art.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, photo gallery, making-of featurette, audio commentary with director Paul Dalio, and A Conversation with Paul Dalio and Dr. Kay Jamison. A digital HD copy is included.",1465171200,7,2268,5.254143646408839

Dr. Preston Bailey, Doug Riggs to explore more on the ever growing programed illnesses.  To keep this information away from the public and pretend in the ol ""brain chemistry off"" myth is just more Hollywood mind control. The DID and splitting on personalities has been going on for eons and many artists were
unsuspecting subjects of their time. Probably not all bipolars were programed but to ignore the topic
completely when dealing with the issue is redundant and naive. I give it one star for not even once

Not everyone with the disorder loves the mania and wants to be off meds.  More demonstration of trying to get meds adjust might be something to demonstrate and how difficult that can be might be something to show instead.  Also, mania is only part of it and movies tend to focus on that  It doesn't show enough of the depressive aspects which are the majority of the disorder.  They only touched on part of it and then show both of them as suicidal.  The hospital portion is unrealistic.  The would not have metal forks.  You don't just have ONE person watching.  You don't get free ability to walk around and be outside of your room at night.  That was such a joke!  You have to be in bed at a certain hour with lights out.
