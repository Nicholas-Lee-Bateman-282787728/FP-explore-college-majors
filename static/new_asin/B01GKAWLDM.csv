7763796,5,B01GKAWLDM,"I love all of Jessica's workouts so of course I had to buy this, since it's brand new. All 3 workouts on this video are fun and challenging.",1467763200,,140,4.035714285714286
7763797,5,B01GKAWLDM,"All three of these workouts were fun to do. They are energetic, but low-impact. Jessica shows modifications for a more advanced option, while Debbie shows modifications to make it easier. As usual Jessica keeps things fun so the time just flies by. I like that the step workout didn't have any super complicated moves. It's been a long time since I did step workouts, so I definitely didn't want something that was too hard to keep up with. The moves were easy to pick up and they will keep your heart rate up the whole time. I don't have a ball yet, but you can use a towel to do the Have a Ball workout. It's a lot of fun with different moves that keeps it interesting. Steady, Ready, Go is a good interval workout that is effective, but isn't hard to do. The moves are easy to learn and done at a good pace. The whole DVD is a great cardio workout that isn't too hard to do, but is still effective.",1467763200,,901,4.213872832369942
7763798,5,B01GKAWLDM,"I received this new DVD last night and did all 3 cardio workouts this morning for my daily workout. I used a small ball and stepper with no risers.

All three workouts include Jessica and her mom Debbie. The background is nice with a bright, home feel. The music is a little low compared to Jessica's talking, but I think its probably hard to balance the sounds without feeling like shes yelling. Most of the music on all three workouts had a beat, no words. I recognized some of the music, but there was alot of new music as well.

At the start of each workout Jessica gives a daily mantra, which I found really cool and inspirational. All the workouts are standing routines (no floor work) with no jumping.

At the bottom right hand corner, there is a 30 minute countdown clock on every workout.

Workout number 1 is called ""Steady, Ready, Go!"" (31:15 total mins)
*You do not need any equipment for this workout.

*She did about a 3 minute warm up and about a 3 minute cool down with stretching.

*There are 5 different intervals in this workout. Jessica shows us what the different intervals are during the warm up section.

*Although this workout is low impact, she keeps a steady pace for the ""steady"" portion, then the music beats speeds up more for the ""ready"" portion, and then an all out ""Go"" 60 second interval.

*I enjoyed this workout and I love that her mom Debbie seemed more confident and talkative in these workouts, than she has in any of the other DVDs.

Workout number 2 is called ""Stride and Step"" (29:55 total mins)
*You need a step (no risers) or small square space if you don't have a step.

*She did about a 5 minute warm up and about a 4 minute cool down with stretching.

*She keeps a steady pace the entire top since we use the step for the entire workout. She explains that she purposely did not do fast music or interval type music so we could stay safe using the step. I felt like it was fast enough to get a good fat burn and keep my heart rate up, but not so fast that I would twist my knee or get confused with the steps.

*I love step workouts but I don't feel very coordinated and I don't like high impact exercises. This workout was neither thank goodness! I used a full step no risers, not a half step like Jessica, and it worked fine.

Workout number 3 is called ""Have a ball"" (32:40 total mins)
*You need a small (non weighted) ball or a hand towel.

*I didn't feel there was a warm up to this workout at all. Although she did say after about 5 minutes that the warm up was over, but I didn't feel there was a music beat difference to it. You start immediately into the workout at a medium pace holding the ball, so I would recommend a quick warm up of your own if you start with this workout.

*You use the ball or towel for the entire workout.

*She does different ""coordination series"" exercises through out this workout; like a squat/ball chop and jog up/toss the ball in the air/jog back/bounce the ball on the ground.

*This workout was fun and I would highly recommend getting a small ball instead of a towel for this workout. I got a playground ball for $1.00 at my local Dollar Tree store.

I really enjoyed these workouts and can't wait to try her other new ""Walk Strong"" dvds!!",1467331200,60,3227,4.323383084577115

7763801,5,B01GKAWLDM,I am 68 and have excercised all my life. Right now trying to loose belly fat. This DVD is one of the things that is helping. All exercises are helping and I feel so good afterwards. Have to do a lot of stretches of course at this age. But very interested in all I can do to keep in good health. Will probably use more of her DVDs. She makes you sweat!!!,1520899200,,353,3.9166666666666665
7763802,5,B01GKAWLDM,"I love Jessica Smith workouts!  Any one you pick is certain to be a winner.  She will have you sweating with a smile on your face.  Her instructions and routines are challenging, but NOT punishing!  I love that she gives modifications for if you don't have the same equipment she does.  For the ""Step and Stride"" workout, I did not have a step, but her mom Debbie did the workout without one and I just followed her lead and got a great workout!

Jessica is positive and born to be an instructor.  If you want an easy and fun way to burn fat, look no further than this series of workouts.",1520553600,2,588,4.243243243243243

7763805,5,B01GKAWLDM,This is fantastic! I had back surgery a year ago and have really struggled finding something that would not cause me a lot of pain. Someone suggested Jessica Smith workouts to me and sure enough I can do them and feel good physically and mentally! I definitely recommend her workouts to any and everyone!,1515888000,,304,4.648148148148148

7763807,4,B01GKAWLDM,"In general I love Jessica's workouts. I got this because I wanted the step routine. I enjoy that routine although her step is the size of a small square, not a real step.  But her ball routine did nothing for me. I may need to try it again?",1513123200,,240,4.0
7763808,5,B01GKAWLDM,"Such good workouts. I love them, am glad they are only 35 minutes and have a timer. I like these better than any others in this instructors vast repertoire.",1508457600,,156,4.413793103448276
7763809,5,B01GKAWLDM,I enjoy all of Jessica Smith's DVDs! I have used home workouts since the 80's and know I get an effective workout without killing my joints with Jessica's well-cued instructions.,1505433600,,178,4.966666666666667
7763810,5,B01GKAWLDM,"Great work outs. Makes me sweat and I work out five days a week using this DVD for when I can't get to the Y. I am, ahem, 60+ years old and I can keep up.",1504569600,,154,3.3055555555555554
7763811,4,B01GKAWLDM,"Good workouts, but which one are the best to burn more calories and lose weight?",1503964800,,80,4.4
7763812,5,B01GKAWLDM,"This workout DVD has three 30 minute workouts. The first one requires no special equipment and uses interval training. The second one uses a step, but can be done without one. The third uses a ball or a towel can be substituted. All three workouts are interesting and effective. I like that the exercises are low-impact, but get my heart rate up and work my abs.

I would recommend mixing in another type of workout in addition to these. I like to alternate these workouts with some resistance and floor work. But these are great to get some aerobic exercise when it's cold out and you can't make it to a class or a track.",1502841600,5,622,4.408695652173913
7763813,5,B01GKAWLDM,"I have several of Jessica's Walk Strong videos, and I really enjoy them - or maybe more accurately, I don't hate them - which is important for me, since I am NOT someone who really enjoys working out.  They are varied enough to keep me interested (which is saying a lot because I get bored with my workouts pretty quickly) and are effective without being overly strenuous.  I certainly work up a sweat with these and feel the burn, but I do not end up exhausting myself and causing myself pain.  I do not really LIKE working out, so I have learned that if something makes me ""suffer"" I am not going to do it consistently.  However, with Jessica, I get as close to FUN as I am likely to get while exercising. Using her routines, I feel like I have gotten a good workout without totally burning out.  These Walk Strong videos also target different areas using different approaches which draw on a variety of techniques from Pilates to dance to yoga, keeping it fresh and engaging.",1501286400,7,978,4.47191011235955
7763814,5,B01GKAWLDM,Love it,1500508800,,7,3.0
7763815,5,B01GKAWLDM,"Im used to more intense workouts from beachbody, however I was looking for a workout to do in my third trimester. Most beachbody workouts have floor exercises and are too intense in later pregnancy. Jessica's workouts are perfect for what I needed! None of the movements in this DVD are done on the floor. Mostly a walking/cardio workout with light muscle toning included.  What I love is that you can take this at your own pace, add weights or a weighted ball for a more intense workout or just follow the modification and you will still get your heart rate up and a nice sweat. She is fun and I love that she includes her mom in the workouts. These two make a great team, they are encouraging, and make you feel like they could be your friends if you met them in person:)  They are also dressed very modestly which I greatly appreciate while doing these exercises in front of my kids.",1499817600,2,886,4.429447852760736
7763816,5,B01GKAWLDM,"I have had this DVD for over a year now and figured it deserved a review.  I enjoy this DVD.  It isn't one of my first choices from her catalog of work outs but I reach for it when I want a change from some of the others of Jessica's that I've been doing.  Have a Ball is a lot of fun, and while interval training isn't my favorite thing to do, it's something I know that I need to improve on, so Steady, Ready, Go, is a great place to start!

EDIT: I had originally given this 4 starts but really that's only because Jessica has other DVDs that I love more.  That didn't mean that this one deserved a 4.  So, after revisiting 2 of the workouts on this DVD, I wanted to come back and update my review.  I love the banter between Jessica and Debbie.  It makes doing an interval workout just a little easier.  lol",1498780800,,811,4.01875
7763817,5,B01GKAWLDM,Excellent,1497484800,,9,9.0
7763818,5,B01GKAWLDM,"ok. I just discovered Jessica Smith TV about a year ago and just recently started buying her dvds. I love this woman's workouts! This is a new favorite!! Its just a lot of fun! all 3 workouts are 30 minutes and they just fly by. I have to modify  a lot of upper body moves due to a bad shoulder but you lose nothing in any of these workouts by modifying your arms! Debbie ( Jessica's  mom) does several modifications and Jessica is  always saying "" do what works for you"". It's so refreshing to have a trainer that understands  that we all have different levels of fitness for different reasons! I highly recommend this did!",1497312000,,624,4.353448275862069
7763819,5,B01GKAWLDM,"Jessica is very encouraging, easy to follow, and full of common sense. Having two generations in the same video (Jessica's mom) is pure genius. I'm able to follow Debbie who is closer to my own age (57) and get the right cardio benefit without feeling like I can't keep up. You will love this exercise!",1496620800,,302,4.509090909090909

7763821,5,B01GKAWLDM,"These are the toughest workouts I've ever done. I am currently in week 2 of Jessica's Walk Strong 2.0 program, and I've never sweated so much or worked so hard. I really feel like I'm making great changes to my body, and each day, I feel a little stronger than the day before.

I started out about 100 pounds overweight. I've been working out daily for the past couple of months, but have seen more positive changes in my body in the past couple of weeks with these DVDs than the rest of the workouts I had been doing. I don't like going to the gym, so the fact that I can do these in the comfort of my own home is huge for me. I enjoy Jessica's positivity and daily mantras. If you plan on doing the entire program, you will need a small playground ball, a 6 foot medium resistance band, an aerobic stepper, a yoga mat, and two sets of handweights, one lighter and one heavier. I use 3 pound and 5 pound weights.

Please do not be fooled by reviews that these workouts are easy or boring. For someone who is very advanced, these may not be enough, but for beginner to intermediate, these will make you work like you never have before.",1494979200,3,1135,4.225806451612903
7763822,4,B01GKAWLDM,"This is the first Jessica Smith workout I have ordered. Her program will DEFINITELY make you sweat. I'm not sure it's a great program for people who are just beginning to exercise but for moderate to heavy exercisers this should be a decent program.

My only criticisms are that I'm not that thrilled with some of the music and some of her moves. Overall I would give this workout a solid A-/B+.",1494460800,,395,4.486111111111111
7763823,1,B01GKAWLDM,"Jessica doesn't tell you in advance what step she is going to do next, no count down to the change over, moves very quickly from one step to the next - recipe for injury if you try to keep up. Disclaimer is that I'm a 60 yr old, who has been working out with Leslie Sansone's dvds for months.  I bought this one just because I'd gotten bored with the 1 dvd I owned, but afraid that this one doesn't suit my needs.",1494115200,,413,3.9759036144578315
7763824,5,B01GKAWLDM,"This is a fun workout DVD. It has three 30 minute workouts, all completely different.
1. Steady Burn - 2 minutes at a slow pace, 2 minutes at a fast pace, then 1 minute super pace. Equivalent to 2.5 miles. I like that she shows you what the 1 minute intervals will be in the warm up.
2. Step and Stride - she uses a small step with easy moves. She never goes to the front of the step, so if all you have is regular step, you can use it. Equivalent to 2.0 miles.
3. Have a Ball - she uses a kid's plastic ball to work mostly the abs. Equivalent to 2.0 miles.
I'm not sure which workout is my favorite; they're all fun. Jessica works out with her mom, which I think is great. I was using LS videos, but they're pretty much all the same, and I don't like listening to the same conversation 100 times. I had to ramp up the workouts myself to get much out of them. Jessica pretty much sticks to talking about what you need for the workout, and I don't feel like I need to add to it. I already own three of her DVDs and will most likely purchase more.",1492560000,15,1045,3.957345971563981

7763827,5,B01GKAWLDM,Well it is certainly fun and I hope I am burning fat as well.  I have quite a few of Jessica's workouts and I never get tired of them.  It is also great that she can keep the new routines fresh and fun.,1490918400,,202,3.6744186046511627

7763839,5,B01GKAWLDM,"This little gem of a DVD has three cardio workouts, all about 30 minutes each.  I must love this DVD because every time I plan to do one of the workouts, I end up doing all three because I am having so much fun.

Each workout has Jessica and her Mom, Debbie.  Debbie is always doing a lower impact and/or an easier move than Jessica.

And, yay, the moves are perfectly timed to the beat of the music, something Cathe Friedrich never does.  There is a little countdown timer in the lower right corner of each workout.

STEADY, READY GO!
This workout has low impact, high intensity timed intervals.  Youll do 3 minutes of steady state, 2 minutes of a ready (slightly faster than steady) and finally 1 minute of a high intensity interval.

The moving mantra: Focus on what is possible.

The warm up consists of low impact versions of the interval moves.  And, the best part of all, Miss Peanut, Jessicas adorable French bulldog, makes a cameo!

Some of my favorite moves from this workout include: squat swim, diamond half-jack, skater half-circle and toe tap pull down.

STRIDE AND STEP
This workout uses a small step platform for added intensity.  Debbie is just stepping on the floor.  It consists of very basic step moves so even the most coordination-challenged folks can do this.  But, it requires you to think a bit about the moves, which I love.

All of the moves are low impact; there is no jumping.  Yet, my heart rate was elevated for the entire workout.  I even make it more challenging by using one riser under the step and wearing 2 pound weighted glove.  This gives me a nice little burn.

Moving mantra: Turn obstacles into stepping stones.

Some of my favorite moves from this workout include:  foot and ankle warm up, half-snow angels on the step, Charleston, alternate toe taps on the floor.

HAVE A BALL
Jessica uses a small playground ball and Debbie uses a balled-up towel.  Jessicas ball is a pretty pink; I want one.  Peanut also makes a cameo in this workout.

Moving mantra: Keep your eye on the ball.

The best way to describe this workout is fun and flowing.  I just love using the ball; it gives the workout a whole new dimension and it also works my abs!

Some of my favorite moves in this workout include: plie power circles, skater with figure 8 arms, alternate heel dig scoop.  There is even an ab/balance section at the end.

If you are looking for some cardio routines that work you without exhausting you, you will enjoy this DVD.",1483574400,2,2463,4.542141230068337

I was so excited to see the step and the ball make an appearance! I have been doing Jessica's Youtube stride and step and the cardio ball ballet workouts for a long time.  I was wishing she'd do another step workout, so she must have been reading my mind!  Please keep them coming Jessica!

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I felt that each workout wasn't as difficult as maybe they could have been. Her 6 mile mix was much tougher.

She does a great job of making the workouts fun and enjoyable without being super bubbly and annoying like some instructors.  As for this particular workout  - I thought it was an excellent cardio workout.  It definitely got my heart rate up and I was sweating by the end, but it was a good sweat.  I didn't feel like I needed to sit down and take a nap afterwards, rather I felt accomplished and energized.  If, like me, you just can't get into the Cross-fit, Insanity, kill-yourself workouts, but want to keep yourself healthy and fit; I highly recommend this video!",1471305600,6,674,4.661016949152542

7763877,4,B01GKAWLDM,"Step tip:  If you have a full step (rectangle) and not the half step (square) that Jessica uses, don't worry.  You can place your long step on the floor so that you stand at the base of the short side.  She never takes you in front of the step, so you don't really need to buy a half step.  I never saw that written anywhere and I could have saved myself some money.  You can also use the setup that her mom Debbie has by taping a visual square on the floor and not stepping up and down during the routine.

I had to smile at the reviews that said these DVDs were boring because they are about to kill me.  Those folks must be in great shape.  I may get to that level too.  I'm working on my attitude, but right now I exercise because I have to...not because it is joyful for me.  Just being honest.  Maybe I will change my mind later and think of these routines as boring and go for more gusto, but right now I'm just trying to get used to them.  Jessica and Debbie smile and are so nice about it...bless their hearts.  (I'm a hard sell.)

I'll keep working with the program.  Jessica's customer service is outstanding.  She encourages you to ask questions or send in your comments because she believes in her products.  ...and it shows.",1470096000,17,1238,4.2

7763882,5,B01GKAWLDM,"Walking, Walking Walking! I love any walking DVD and this one is one of my favorites. Steady, Ready Go uses intervals in an easy-to-do way. Plus, you've always got Debbie doing more low-impact/easier options to help in case you're not ready for all the energy of Jessica.

Have a Ball is my all-time favorite!!!! I don't have a playground ball, but Debbie uses a towel. I usually substitute a yarn ball and it's amazingly fun. I am always disappointed when the workout is over, which is always excellent. I love workouts that don't have you wishing it would just be over.

Stride and Step is also fun and you don't have to own a step to do it. However, it works best if you focus on a particular floor area and use that as your step, because you work more of your coordination and agility that way.",1469836800,,798,4.421768707482993
7763883,5,B01GKAWLDM,I really like these new dvds from Jessica. She is providing you with a variety of different 3 30 minutes of cardio workouts here. I found each one to be a different level of cardio and always provides you with a beginners level which I  appreciate. I enjoyed them all but found the stride and step one to be the most harder ones out of all three but to be doable. They are all fun workouts with great music as expected from Jessica. I've enjoyed her mom doing the beginners level and being in these new workouts with Jessica. They made a great team.,1469836800,,549,4.278846153846154
7763884,5,B01GKAWLDM,This is one of my favorite dvds in the 4 dvd series. My favorite workout is have a ball. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it but once I started it. It was really fun. The next day I could really feel it in my sides. Which is a good thing. I currently have a fractured ankle that is almost healed. I am able to do this dvd with no problems.

7763885,5,B01GKAWLDM,"I bought the six week transformation videos back in april and adding these videos to them gives me a great workout. I love the variety and the positive vibe I get from Jessica. I like that she is personable and has her mom do the easier adjustments so that I can get used to the workout. With summer being crazy with the kids out of school, I find this works well so the kids can watch their shows while mom works out in the basement. I definitely feel the workout and am sore from it which is great. She works all different areas of the body from circuit lower, upper and total, to walk aerobics, yoga, and more circuit training in these. There only about 30 to 35 min long and she tells you on the back what you need for extra equipment. Mostly hand weights, stretch band, ball, and step is what you need but her mom does the workout without sometimes so you can still do it until you get the added equipment. I loved that she added the step this time. Overall very happy with this purchase. I am not in the best shape and have lots of work cut out for me to lose weight and be healthier. This gives me motivation to do so.",1469491200,,1125,4.141552511415525
7763886,2,B01GKAWLDM,"I love Jessica but another reviewer mentioned these workouts were boring & I agree. They did seem poorly thrown together...as if in a hurry.  To give her credit, I liked the step workout the best.  I think she should do more step workouts but since she isn't an actual ""step"" instructor I understand why she doesn't.  This particular step workout may have worked better with a longer step tho (even tho I have the half step like hers).  I do like her stride & step workout on YouTube better tho. I just find I sweat more from that one.  As far as the ""Steady, Ready, Go"" workout...it was the most boring & had weird moves in it.  The ball workout was pretty boring too & I agree with another user that said she kept looking at the clock. Her ball workout on YouTube is better & her Cardio Ball Ballet workout is one of my favorite.  I will just stick to her YouTube workouts because they fly by.  That being said, I appreciate all her free YouTube workouts, the variety of workouts formats available, & the volume of them (over 400) on her channel.  I was really excited for these workouts so I am let down.  I think maybe she is putting DVDs out too frequently but I guess that is what her fans are asking for.  I can see she is trying to make them better & more like the YT workouts but she just missed the mark somehow. What I have noticed with the DVDs is that they are MUCH easier than the YT workouts so if you are a fan that likes the challenge of those, then you will find these way to easy. I just don't sweat much when I do them.  I feel her DVDs are always geared for the older population so if you are anything but a beginner you may want to try something else.  I do like her DVD sets that have the Cardio Kickbox Abs & the Barre dvd (notably the cardio routine on it).",1469318400,5,1782,4.145348837209302

7763892,3,B01GKAWLDM,"I like but didn't love this DVD and I have most of everything Jessica has put out as I'm a fan.  However, I don't think this matches her original Walk Strong series.  It seemed to be put together too quickly and while the workouts are good and the banter between her and her Mom is fun I prefer more professionally done videos.  That's just me, of course, and Jessica her Mom Debbie are delightful.  Other than ""Have a Ball!"" I honestly didn't enjoy the workouts and kept looking at the timer.  I don't think I'll be doing these again soon - I like Jessica's other ""Walk On"" DVDs much better, especially when it comes to HiiT.  Jessica and her Mom are adorable and my heart rate definitely rose (I wear a Polar F4 monitor) so it's a worthy purchase but I was disappointed.  I admittedly didn't do the step workout because I was so bored with the others but to each their own.

7763896,5,B01GKAWLDM,"First off, let me start by saying, I own ALL of Jessica Smith's DVD's (including the early releases from GAIAM, Women's Health and 10 Minute Solutions) and I TREASURE each of them for their own uniqueness.  There has not been ONE that has collected dust on my fitness DVD shelves, and I rotate through them quite regularly.  I have been the biggest fan of the workout DVDs and programs that include the biggest variety, feature new and challenging moves, and allow me to workout in a small amount of space with minimal equipment.  So when I heard Jessica had a new set of DVDs coming out, initially I thought, how can she possibly have ANY NEW MATERIAL.  I was wrong!  Jessica, is the MASTER OF NEW AND EXCITING WORKOUTS!  This DVD has EVERYTHING I love with the variety and FUN it promises.  Burn Fat & Have Fun will be a DVD I use regularly from this point on.

The DVD arrives, as pictured, in a hard shell case with the advertised artwork.  The DVD includes 3, 30-minute routines that can be modified based on your fitness level. (I have broken down each routine below)  As with all of Jessica's routines, we get Jessica's ever exuberant (without being too sweet or cheesy) cueing,  as well as modification demonstrations by Jessica, which are then performed by her Mom, Debbie, who has been a mainstay on several of Jessica's newer releases.  This DVD is set in a home,  in front of a large set of double doors overlooking a beautiful backyard pool and landscape.  The camera remains focused on both Jessica and Debbie throughout the entirety of each workout, so you're never left guessing what you should be doing.  (always a plus).  The music is always upbeat, and on cue for each routine and really makes you want to move your feet.  Some equipment is used during the routines, but you DO NOT NEED IT to be able to get a great workout with these routines, so don't let that turn you off from purchasing this DVD.

Walk 1:  Ready, Steady, Go! (Calories Burned: 375)
I loved this interval-based, 30 minute walk.  This entire routine is LOW IMPACT and there is absolutely NO JUMPING.  This routine is set
up in a 3-2-1 fashion, where for three minutes, you move at a moderate pace, followed by two minutes of a steadier paced followed by a minute, all-out, low impact interval.  This sequence is repeated 5 times, followed by a refreshing cool down and stretch.  There are the signature moves you see in most of Jessica's walking DVDs, such as the ""side to side"" walk, grapevine with clap, and hamstring curls, but MANY new moves I've never seen before in ANY of her routines, directional changes, and believe it or not, a brain teaser or two.  Jessica incorporates arm movements to help elevate the heart rate,  while your feet are moving, yet stay on the ground.  It's a win-win  situation.  The music is up tempo, and the beat is infectious.  I couldn't believe how fast the 30 minutes was over with, and I was ready to do it again.  As always, there is a modifier.  Jessica's
Mom, Debbie, joins on low impact modifications, but she's still working.  And the laughter and conversation between the two is so much
fun!  Debbie is opening up more, and talking more during the workouts, and it's so much fun to see her personality shine.  I just love the
dynamic between Jessica and her Mom, and feel like part of the family when I work out with them.  I can't wait to do this workout again and
again. 5/5 Stars.
Mileage Equivalent:  Approximately 2.5 miles

Walk 2:  Stride and Step (275 calories burned):
This routine was my favorite of all on the DVD for many reasons.  First, I modified, and didn't use a step, and I still sweat like crazy and had a blast, but second, the music was just so much fun!  (I recognized some of my favorite upbeat songs from my FAVORITE Jessica Smith DVD Cardio Abs)  Jessica uses a ""mini"" step for this routine, while Debbie, the modifier, simply uses a ""taped out section"" in the shape of a box on the floor.  You do not need to mark the floor to make this routine work FYI.  If you have a longer step, you can simply turn it length wise away from you, and work off the end.  Jessica uses her step on the LOWEST setting, but mixing up the rise height  can give you lots of room to grow.  This routine is not your typical ""step aerobics class"" and Jessica makes it clear that she is NOT a step aerobics instructor.  For me, this is a plus, because I do not have the coordination to do intricate choreography on the step.  What we do see is walking, with stepping up and on of the step (or in place if you do not have a step), knee and arm raise combos, hamstring curls with bicep curls and tricep kickbacks,  side to side chasse moves, and some coordination and mind-challenge moves.  There are also mini squats and lunges as well as side and rear leg kickback moves that BURN THE BUNS!!!.  I got a GREAT burn without using a step.
5/5 Stars
Mileage Equivalent: Approximately 2 miles.

Walk 3:  Have A Ball! (280 calories burned)
This walking-style, cardio based routine clocked in at 32 minutes in length, and we see Peanut for a few moments at the beginning of the workout before she heads off to take a nap.  The full routine is done standing.  This routine delivered as promises, as I literally HAD A BALL working my butt off, and working up a HUGE sweat without any high impact.  This routine incorporates the use of a small playground ball (I used a squishy ball from a Pilates kit I have).  Alternatively, you can use a hand towel if you do not have a ball.  This routine is kept low impact, with a few exercises giving you the option to up-level with the ball being used to elevate the heart rate, and improve hand and eye coordination as well as grip strength.  This routine is excellent for the core, using a lot of side to side, arcing, and rainbow like movements at the waist, and above the head.  Plus there is a SUPER FUN Coordination Series repeated throughout where you can toss and bounce the ball.  Fans of Jessicas ball routines on YouTube, as well as her Barre Fitness DVD will enjoy and appreciate this routine.
5/5 stars.
