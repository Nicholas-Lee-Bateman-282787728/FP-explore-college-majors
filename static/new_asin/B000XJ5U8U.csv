Few things to note:
Old 1980s cartoon graphics.
Some rules don't apply (such as 2-line passes)

This is a good start to teaching your kids hockey rules.",1323043200,,201,4.405405405405405

8228475,4,B000XJ5U8U,"Although I grew up in Northern Minnesota (which is major hockey country) the only type of hockey I was really interested in was the cute hockey players *grin*. Now grown up with nephews and a whole host of other family who are majorly into hockey I decided it was time to learn more about it. My nephews have this DVD and watch it all the time (their Dad is Canadian). As part of their efforts to teach me hockey we watched this DVD - and it was really cute! I finally figured out what icing is - and learned the difference between a Power Play and Penalty Killer. Then they dragged me to the pond rink by their house and we put the rules and info I learned into action. We had a blast!

If you have a child or want to embrace your inner child and learn about hockey then Peter's your guy :) Very enjoyable and cute!",1293321600,,816,4.132075471698113
