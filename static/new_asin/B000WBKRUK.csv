8222053,5,B000WBKRUK,"I have this DVD under the title ""Cardio Sculpt Fusion""--not sure why they changed the title, but she calls it ""Total Body Lite"" in the video, so I'm pretty sure it's the same thing. I used to do The Firm workouts 4-5 days per week and got in great shape from them. However, I had an ankle injury (from before) that got aggravated badly and stopped pretty much everything for several years in order to avoid surgery on my ankle. I have been so stressed out lately that I realized on my way home today I was actually CRAVING a Firm workout. I have a pretty large selection but chose this one for its low-impact qualities. It was really great--just what I needed. Enough energy to get the pent-up aggression out, but low-impact enough that I could get through the whole thing without stopping despite my serious lack of cardio in the past few years (I've only been doing some of the ballet barre workouts-very rarely, and some horseback riding a couple times a month if I'm lucky). I got a decent sweat going with this DVD, got through it before I had to get to class tonight, and it hasn't seemed to bother my ankle (or my back). My knees are a little sore, but I think that's because our carpet isn't very cushy at all--I'm going to use a mat next time. My knees feel like I've been kneeling for a while, not like they've been twisted or injured. It also didn't completely wear me out--I'm often way too exhausted after a workout to accomplish anything else that day, but this actually energized me--so this is what everyone means when they say they feel good after exercising! I think this DVD just got me back into working out.",1392076800,3,1628,4.43
8222054,5,B000WBKRUK,"I purchased<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Ultimate-Fat-Burning-Collection/dp/B002GRMVUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection</a>awhile back, and this 46-minute workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD. (Note:  this workout appears there under the name ""Cardio Sculpt Fusion."")  Emily Welsh leads this workout with 4 background exercisers, including Sue-Mi showing modifications; they are exercising on the Firm's newer, airy white set. Emily describes this as a ""muscle recovery workout,"" and she emphasizes that you don't want to fatigue your muscles during the workout. Given this, she uses light weights throughout--either a single 5# or 2 lighter weights (I used 3#). However, this is still a true AWT (aerobic weight training) workout in that you are constantly moving while using the weights, keeping your heart rate up the entire time.

Emily begins with a 5-minute warm-up. Rather than the Firm's traditional moves, there are some different exercises here, such as a spinal twist with a bit of a lunge (although Emily also does plie squats and lunge/glute lifts) as well as about 1 minute dynamic stretching. The first weights segment is 5 minutes long, and Emily has you pick up one dumbbell to start for a squat with balance and overhead tricep move. Next is a dip and scoop moving into a rear dip/side squat with arms. This is followed by the ""butt and back burner,"" a deadlift with leg extensions and arms plus side leg extensions. Emily concludes with some brief back stretches.

Another 5-minute weight segment follows. This one starts with a lunge/knee lift/chest opener combination, adding a leg extension. Next come side plies with external rotation to work the rotator cuff (nice!) and then a more standard Firm move, pivots with alternating biceps/triceps. The last exercise is a 1-arm row, but Emily adds a knee raise to this familiar move, and she again concludes with some brief stretching. The first cardio segment is also about 5 minutes long, and it begins with a step tap forward, adding a knee up and a leg extension. This is followed by a cross step with glute extension in a single-single-double pattern (Emily uses this pattern often). The final two moves are a V-step which expands into a larger turn step and a side lunge with knee; the entire sequence is repeated several times.

The next weights series (also 5 minutes) starts with a side lunge and then adds arm scoops and center kicks. Additional exercises are tap squats with clean and press and pendulum (a side delt move) with toe taps; again, Emily concludes with stretching. For the second cardio section, Emily states ""we're gonna get a little sassy!"" The moves include side hips, triple step, samba, and mambo. Although the moves themselves weren't all that complicated, it seemed like Emily tried to do a bit too much with changing the direction (L-R) and tempo. The final standing weights segment (5 minutes) begins with Figure 8 side lunges and then moves into lunges with knee lifts plus triceps/tummy toner. Without the weights, Emily cues chair pose to side squat to rear lunge, finishing with a twisting lunge (corkscrew). She finishes the segment with a moving warrior stretch.

The 5-minute floor work begins with ""star,"" a side plank move. This is followed by ""moving cat,"" which includes both a leg extension and a push-up. Next comes flying bug and only one slightly more traditional crunch move, circle abs. Emily begins the 5.5 minute stretch lying on the back for thread the needle, then switches over to the stomach for cobra and a thigh stretch. From a seated position, she moves through mermaid, a hamstring stretch, and a twist, and finally, she concludes the workout standing with inner thigh and neck stretches.

I really enjoy this workout! I like Emily, and I thought she did a nice job leading here. Those looking for a hard-core routine might be disappointed, but I think those who enjoy Ellen Barrett-style DVDs are apt to enjoy this as well. (In fact, although the crew here wear shoes, the workout is entirely low-impact and could be done barefoot, as with Ellen's workouts.) I consider myself to be a high intermediate exerciser, but I still get a lot of of this workout, and I will continue using it for recovery (or whenever I need a lighter day) as Emily recommends.",1360627200,4,4390,5.105849582172702
8222055,3,B000WBKRUK,"I was shocked to find out that Total Body Lite is the same work out at Total Body Fusion which I already had. The work out itself is great for a day when you do not want to push hard.  But, sadly, I already had it.  So, I will give it away and someone else can enjoy it.",1277424000,2,270,3.6379310344827585
8222056,5,B000WBKRUK,"Fyi this workout is now called (Cardio Sculpt Fusion). Good  for the days you want to do a light low impact workout. I really liked this one. The moves take a few times to catch on, but overall good light workout. In the beginning of the workout the instructor says that this is a recovery workout, it is exactly that.",1214006400,,318,4.3
8222057,5,B000WBKRUK,"Just an FYI to folks that this title has been re-issued. It's the same workout, just a different title. The new title is The FIRM Cardio Sculpt Fusion & it is available here at Amazon.",1197331200,9,184,4.285714285714286
