1646989,5,B00005Q3CC,"What can I say about this dream production that hasn't been said for this 2001 DVD and an identical DVD that was put out in 2003?[...]

Tebaldi's voice is unbelievably beautiful and the rest of the dream cast sing like a dream. For a 1958 recording, the picture is fine and the sound is excellent.  The only thing I didn't like were the cuts.  The scene in which Don Carlo reveals himself to Don Alvaro was cut, so we don't see why Don Alvaro knows Don Carlo is his enemy when they meet again.

Overall, it is an amazing production, and I highly recommend it.",1268956800,7,559,4.295238095238095
1646990,5,B00005Q3CC,This may be Black and White but that in no way detracts from the wonder of having three of the foremost opera stars of their day pour their hearts out in this most beautifully sung 'Forza'. Franco Corelli is magnificent and the pairing with Renata Tebaldi inspired. Ettore Bastianini's beautiful liquid baritone is superb. Whatever you do don't miss this!,1264809600,2,355,4.933333333333334
1646991,5,B00005Q3CC,"What other tenor could sing such glorious tones flat on his back??  That duet alone makes this a must have.  And Corelli tears your heart out with ""Tu che inseno.""  The audio does not do Tebaldi justice.  And this was before those high notes got so steely and a bit flat.  Her acting is much better than in the Tosca with London where she was into striking poses.  Corelli's voice records well.  Live he sounds just as on records, except the volume about triples from top G on up.  With Tebaldi you lose the huge sumptiousness of her voice in the mid range.  Until I heard her live I thought she was just quite nice but couldn't understand the fanatic fans of hers.  Live she was amazing.  The voice filled every corner of the hall enveloping us.

I do treasure my memories of seeing these 3 great singers and getting their autographs which I still have.",1247443200,2,854,4.403846153846154
1646992,5,B00005Q3CC,"Although it is in black&white, it is an important and precious historical document(Teatro San Carlo of Naples, 1958) and is definitely a must buy. The tenor Franco Corelli is outstanding as always, offering an extremely romantic and heroic interpretation of the hero (Don Alvaro) with his instantly recognizable strong, rich, dark, but highly artistically nuanced timbre.  By those qualities, he manages to convey all the aspects of the character, (as Minnie observed), ranging from the romantic hero in Act I duet (+ his exquisite looks), through the doomed warrior, and finishing with expiating monk.

Renata Tebaldi is another treasure of this recording. Both her singing and acting is otherworldly, taking into account the entire character of Donna Leonora in all its complexity (aristocratic woman in love, desperate expiating woman etc.) She portrays her role both with her ""voce d'angelo"" with extremely nuanced timbre (forte-piano, as well as with her theatrically noble acting.

The baritone Ettore Bastianini offers an extremely convincing interpretation of Donna Leonora's manipulating brother, Don Carlo, with his unique voice possessing a rare velvety beauty. His duet with Corelli's Don Alvaro (when Don Carlo visits him in the convent) is a real treasure and immensely precious artistic achievement. The Bulgarian bass Boris Christoff offers a noble and reverent Padre Guardiano, while the mezzo Oralia Dominguez offers and extremely believable gypsy girl Preziosilla. The comic scenes are marvellously made, as well. The conducting (by Francesco Molinari-Pradelli) is also at the expected level, together with the classically excellent and convincing scenery and costumes.

In short, you won't regret if you buy it.",1245628800,13,1731,5.595419847328245
1646993,5,B00005Q3CC,"Since the listing above is not very clear, let me start by telling you that the item I'm reviewing is the Hardy Classics DVD of Verdi's opera ""La Forza del Destino."" This is a 1958 Italian telecast from the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, starring Renata Tebaldi, Franco Corelli, Ettore Bastianini, Boris Christoff and Renato Capecchi. For knowledgeable opera lovers, the cast listing above will be recommendation enough. To everyone else, let me say that this is some of the greatest singing you're ever likely to hear.
The picture is black and white, the sound is monaural and the scenery doesn't look all that great, but you're not going to care. These singers convey the drama with their voices (as well as with their movements and expressions), and their singing makes everything about this production wonderful.
Hardy Classics has done a great job of restoring this video; the picture and sound are clear (although there are some unimportant visual flaws). I have seen this performance before, on video tapes that don't look or sound this good.
Get this one while you can. Also, check out other Hardy Classics opera DVDs of Otello, Il Trovatore and (especially)Rigoletto. All of them feature performances by important singers who are no longer active and all of them are sufficiently well restored that sound and picture quality are not significant problems.",1031616000,41,1363,5.008810572687224
1646994,5,B00005Q3CC,"This is really unbelievable and incredable what is going on on this video tape. It's not just names that really matters. What  matters is how these outstanding singers are performing and acting. I don't know to whom address at first. I guess, I start with Renata Tebaldi. She was known as Callas's greatest rival and this performance explains it why. As dramatic soprano, Leonora's role siuts to Tebaldi's voice to perfection. The only other soprano who can be compared to Tebaldi is Leontyne Price. Nobody gets even closer to these two. But Tebaldi has even advantage over Price: she is defenitely better in duets than Price used to be. When I've been watching and listening to the duet from the first act, tears came out from my eyes. Only one phrase: ""Alvaro, Io t'amo"" is sung with such impression and with such sadness in eyes and in voice that it's truly difficult to discribe in words. The second act duet with Christoff Tebaldi is really like an angle searching for the place of God. These is incredable. Franco Corelli...what can I say? From the first notes as he appears: ""A per sempre..."" in the first act, it is clear that he would triumph that night and he did. His voice is incredable and here Franco is at his peak. So brilliant at the high notes and what a perfect performance of ""La vita il ferno..."" in the second act.  Ettore Bastianini is my favourite baritone forever and here his is splendid, his voice is full, his singing and acting is perfect. And he never falls behind in the duets with Franco Corelli. Boris Christoff - I've never heard such a strong bass performance in my life. Duet with Leonora and then his ""Maledizione"" is terryfing and makes you cry once again.  I can review this video forever. this is top class, must have and really the best opera performance ever existing on the video tape. I have many recordings. None is even closer to this. This recording made me love ""La forza"" even more than I loved it.",975974400,16,1947,4.589080459770115
1646995,5,B00005Q3CC,"I've been Tebaldi fan since 1958. I heard Tebaldi many times on radio in this role. I had heard she always does better in performance with audience. This tape proves that. While the quality of the tape itself is  ""bumpy"" in places, the Tebaldi pianissimo is worth it.  Ravishing!  Of particular beauty are; "" Son Giunta.."", ""La  Virgine degli'angeli.."", and Pace, Pace mio Dio.."" It is sung in  Italian with no subtitles. It is spellbinding regardless. Worth purchasing,  if for no other reason than one of the greatest casts of the time. The  audio is surprisingly luxuriant. A collector's item, definitely!",945302400,17,608,4.96039603960396
1646996,5,B00005Q3CC,"I have always loved Tebaldi. In fact, I bought the CD edition of this first before the video. Much to my dismay, the audio on the video is MUCH better than the CD. Live and learn, but you don't have to. Forza is a huge  opera. Everything has to click. Believe me, I've done hunting for many  performances of this opera and this is definetely the BEST. Including  Callas, Price, et.al. Corelli has no trouble at all, Bastianini has no  equal in this role, and Tebali is devastating in this opera. Granted, you  will have to overlook the video defects, scratches and shadows, but the  audio is great and because the performances are so red-hot, these few  defects will quickly fade into memory. What can I say, all six voices are  at their peak and there will never be another production of ""La Forza  del Destino"" like this one. Never. A MUST have. Anything you will ever  buy in the future will pale.",926726400,29,900,4.466257668711656
7950077,5,B00005Q3CC,"This Leonora fit Tebaldi's voice like a glove.  She had all the technique and more to spare.  Her high notes and diminuendos are breathtaking.  She's well partnered by Corelli and she seems comfortable singing next to a tenor taller than she.  Bastianini looks great and sings with virility.  The Preziosilla of Oralia Dominguez  cannot be bettered, luxuriating in the humor of the role.  Why people complain about the Rataplan I don't understand; it's short and rousing.  Cristoff and Cappechi are perfect foils.  The convent scene shows Tebaldi at her best, rising in great crescendos and then diminuendos just as it's written.  The last scene is perfection and powerful.  I'm not disturbed by the shabby production.  It serves its purpose in any case.  Molinari Pradelli conducts an idiomatic performance.",1508112000,,808,5.21875
7950078,3,B00005Q3CC,"As another reviewer implied, I think this is best viewed as an historical document.
I'm not sufficiently knowledgeable about singing to rate the performances, but I see no reason to disagree with all the glowing reviews of Tebaldi's and Corelli's performances.
If you are not such a huge Tebaldi or Corelli fan to buy this merely for the opportunity to see their performance on video, however, you should be aware of what to expect.
First, this is very much a kinetoscope recording, and, as you might expect, very blurry.  Actually, I think it is, quite often, blurrier than you might expect, probably reflecting the challenges of broadcasting from an opera house as opposed to a TV studio.
The audio is mostly fairly good, but seems quite variable, generally good, and sometime very good, when Tebaldi is singing, somewhat less so for Corelli, the recording seems to capture the higher the tones better.  Whenever an individual is singing along with the chorus, the quality tends to be worse, sometimes much worse, although oddly not consistently.  I imagine that was harder to ""mike.""  When only the chorus is singing, sometimes the recording sounds great.
Finally, be aware this is definitely not a lavish production.  The painted scenery looks like it is left over from a 19th Century production.  At least that is probably less noticeable, given the black and white and blurry.
The plot is, of course, ridiculous, but if you are bothered by that, you likely wouldn't be watching opera.
One other note and NOTA BENE:  The disk contains an interview with Tebaldi, recorded years later, as a bonus, BUT it is in Italian, and, unlike the opera, has no subtitles.  The disk menu is also in Italian, but it is not hard to figure out what is what on it.
Hard to decide on stars for this, so settled on three.  If your main interest is in seeing these particular two singers together in a performance, then five seems appropriate, as many reviewers gave it.  If your goal is a performance that is going to look good on a larger screen TV, then one star might be appropriate from that point of view.",1481328000,,2095,4.746556473829201
7950079,5,B00005Q3CC,I loved it. It is an old production but the voices and  the orchestra are so good that you forget all that.  The choreography  is good in spite of the years.  The presentation is so fine that you forget that you are seeing it in black and white.,1477440000,,245,4.041666666666667

7950081,5,B00005Q3CC,Problem is. I cannot play it on my DVD player.,1431907200,,46,3.7
7950082,4,B00005Q3CC,"Another Tebaldi triumph, this time with Franco Corelli, rereleased to my utter delight. For decades Madame Tebaldi owned this opera. No Leonora has come to the fore since she stopped singing the role in the early 70's. ""Pace! Pace! has never been heard better, I'm sure. But here again, the video is taxing, although a bit better than ""Andrea Chenier.""",1431216000,,352,4.883333333333334
7950083,4,B00005Q3CC,"This gets four stars only because of its acuity and sound problems which have not been cleared up since I bought this performance from another source.  But we are lucky to have this version of Verdi's great opera by the fabled singers in it from 1958.  All are in prime voice and ready for another day at the opera except Renata Tebaldi isn't just another soprano.  She is sublime as she enters the convent to atone for her supposed sins.  That she does not find peace is brilliantly told to us in her grlorious Pace, pace, mio dio!  We have awaited her like now for too many years; we may be getting close as Netrebko assumes heavier Verdi roles.

Franco Corelli is all but unbelievable as Leonora's lover, Alvaro.  His arias are sung without strain throughout with squillo-filled high notes blasting to the uppermost rungs of the old Metropolitan.  And in his first duet with Bastianini, Solenne in quest ora, he gives us an exquisite diminuendo on each of the high notes that is ethereal.  Bastianini's rich, solid baritone indicates clearly that Verdi baritones are another species that don't grow on trees.  His Urna fatale comes close to matching Leonard Warren's.  Invanno Alvaro, with both Corelli and Bastianini pulling out the stops, brings the house down.

Presiding over all of this is no less than the marvelous Russian bass, Boris Christoff, whom the Met never heard due to visa problems, singing commandingly in all of his scenes.  It does not take long to accustom ourselves to a Russian-accented Italian padre.

We rarely hear Forza today due to a lack of big-voiced Verdi singers who also know how to convey the composer's warmth and humanity and move audience's out of their seats with thrilling singing.

It takes patience to bear the technical faults of the VHS.  We must be grateful we have at least his much to tell us why we don't hear Verdi today as we remember him then.",1426464000,,1896,4.717325227963526
7950084,2,B00005Q3CC,"Yes, the music is wonderful!!! If the libretto of this opera was better, it would undoubtedly be considered a masterpiece. Unfortunately, without the slightest change or embellishment, the plot-outline sounds like one of Anna Russell's funniest opera parodies! But if you want to hear the opera (and you should) this Italian television version will only be of interest to devoted fans of the singers. The film quality is exactly what you would expect of 1950's television (mediocre at best) and the sound is adequate. But simply as an operatic experience, the film is far from satisfying. There is no hint of direction, only the most primitive kind of staging, so you might as well buy a well-produced studio recording and simply listen to the opera. And (worst of all) the producers (probably in obedience to time constraints) abruptly lopped off every audience response...so one is completely frustrated in trying to enjoy this performance as a ""live theatre experience."" Film producers who don't understand the importance of the ovations and the curtain calls following a live performance should not be filming theatre or opera. For the average viewer, I think this video will be a very frustrating experience. [All of that being said, Tebaldi was obviously born to sing this role...so do buy her recording!]",1411603200,2,1311,5.130841121495327
7950085,5,B00005Q3CC,"I was in the opera house that night -- fifty-six years ago, as I write this. The excitement and tension was like a World Cup match and as vivid to me now as it was then.  As the principals sang their arias, their claques unfurled banners, cheered, shouted, and waved placards.  How the singers kept in their characters, I'll never know.  Every phase of the performance was the most extraordinary I have ever experienced. Anyone who loves opera, even a little bit, should have a record of that performance.

7950086,5,B00005Q3CC,"This is a record of an incredible performance.  This is of a standard we are not likely to see again for many years to come and how lucky were those who actually saw such a performance.

Renata Tebaldi was at her best vocally in those years. She commands the stage with her very sensitive acting and her wonderful singing. In the disc's extras, she talks about this performance and about the one she cherished even more, with Dimitri Mitropoulos conducting and Mario del Monaco as Alvaro. This was from Florence somewhat earlier than this. An audio recording exists of that performance but alas nothing visual. You can tell from her interview, what a charismatic but at the same time terribly shy person she was. France Corelli was one of the best tenors of his time and sings and acts beautifully throughout the opera. Ettore Bastianini gives one of his best performances on record, both visual and audio. Boris Christoff is the biggest asset in this performance for two reasons. First of all he was one of the greatest basses ever in the operatic repertoire, with an incredibly powerful voice, full of authority and emotional expression (just listen to his portrayal of King Philip in Verdi's Don Carlos, or of Boris n Boris Godunov) and an incredible actor. Secondly this as far as I know is his only visual record of a complete operatic performance and as such it must be treasured. The rest of the cast have smaller roles and they are all good. Francesco Molinary Pradelli conducts the score with great precision and feeling. The opera is presented very well, with period costumes and sets depicting the story accurately.

The big problem with this DVD is the quality of the image. It is absolutely deplorable. The sound is not brilliant, but just about acceptable. One may well wonder, why such treasures from such immensely important historical performances have not been re-mastered to produce an acceptable image. This is indeed an old performance, from 1958 and one cannot expect miracles from that time. But, just compare this to the 1954 Don Giovanni from Saltsburg with Siepi and Furtwangler. It is in colour and with a very crisp image for its time. Why does this Forza have to be presented in such a poor visual document? It deserves far better.

I still feel that this disc deserves 5 stars for the performance alone, in spite of the very poor quality of its visual content.",1297209600,4,2390,4.779661016949152
