7935726,4,B00005ASPQ,"I agree with Chris' view wholeheartedly, but let me emphasize that for 30 bucks you get so many amazing fights.  The other fights are really horrible, but the announcers are full of humor, making fun of the fighters who avoid contact with the superior foes.  The five fights by Sakuraba are worth the price alone + there are a lot of marquis names like Ruas, Goodrige, Kerr etc.  The early fights had ridiculous rules like no judges/draws so that it encouraged avoidance of a fight. Overall a great value - just use that ff button!",1128902400,,531,4.568421052631579
7935727,3,B00005ASPQ,"First let me say that I am a new spectator to watching mixed martial arts (MMA) events. Like many new fans, I was intrigued by the Ultimate Fighter reality show on Spike TV and wanted to see more.

Of course I had seen the early Ultimate Fighter Championship (UFC) events when it was more of a toughman contest than the sport it is today and didn't care for it back then. As many fans of MMA know, the UFC has evolved into a much better spectator ""sport"" having changed many rules and regulations over the years to make a better product.

I knew how the UFC had begun, but what about the other big promotion in Japan known as PRIDE Fighting Championships? This 5-disc set has the complete matches from PRIDE's 1-5. There are many now legendary fighters highlighted in these early events such as Gary Goodridge, Mark ""The Smashing Machine"" Kerr, Vitor Belfort, the amazing Kazushi Sakuraba, and many from the legendary Gracie family.

The good thing about this set is that you get alot of matches for the money. The bad thing is many of the matches on these discs are long and boring. They could have condensed these 5 discs into one highlight DVD and I would have been happy. You will find that you will be pressing the skip button on your remote quite frequently to avoid falling asleep!

Just like the UFC, PRIDE FC in the early years was testing the waters. There are many mis-matches (a 160lbs. fighter versus a 360lbs. fighter?) and many long matches that have the commentators begging for an ending. However, there are some gems. The Kazushi Sakuraba matches are just amazing and show a true star on the rise!

If you are a fan of the Gracie family, Kazushi Sakuraba, Mark Kerr and others then by all means pick this up. Otherwise get PRIDE FC's later DVD releases where the bugs of the events have been worked out. Great history, but terrible overall entertainment.

DISC 1: PRIDE 1 - 7 Fights featuring Kimo, Dan ""The Beast"" Severn, Gary ""Big Daddy"" Goodridge, Renzo and Rickson Gracie.

DISC 2: PRIDE 2 - 8 Fights featuring Kazushi Sakuraba, Gary Goodridge, Mark Kerr.

DISC 3: PRIDE 3 - 6 Fights featuring Kazushi Sakuraba, Gary Goodridge, Mark Kerr.

DISC 4: PRIDE 4 - 8 Fights featuring Mark Kerr, Kazushi Sakuraba, Marco Ruas, Gary Goodridge, Igor Vovchanchyn, Rickson Gracie.

DISC 5: PRIDE 5 - 6 Fights featuring Kazushi Sakuraba, Vitor Belfort, Mark ""The Hammer"" Coleman, Enson Inoue.",1123545600,,2400,4.665876777251185
7935728,2,B00005ASPQ,"Pride 11 is a great disappointment, even for loyal fans like me. Pride, as fans already know, is a sometimes-uneasy mixture of world-class mixed martial arts and painfully cheesy, professional wrestling-oriented hokum; as you can imagine, Pride has to work very hard to get the balance right. Unfortunately, when they threw the dice on this show, they definitely came up craps.
The Pride organization, in large part because of its links with Japanese professional wrestling and its large revenue stream, is able to buy the talents of arguably the greatest group of mixed martial artists fighting today - Sakuraba, Kerr, Vovchanchyn, Silva, Belfort and a family reunion's worth of Gracies to name a few. When these guys are matched against other top fighters, they really light up the ring.
Unfortunately, these fireworks come at a price. In order to keep demand in Japan high enough to pay for the shows, Pride officials also commonly place big name Japanese pro wrestlers and fighters in the ring based on their popularity rather than their skills. Sometimes Pride also finds big Americans who look tough but have no skills, to feed to their Japanese fighters. The results in these ""popularity"" fights are disappointing - if the fight is for real, the result is a sloppy, boring, lop-sided slapfest that brings out a lot more pity than excitement. If the fight is fixed (which is common for pro wrestling) then what results is the sort of scripted soap-opera that leaves real fight fans feeling ashamed and angry.
Pride 11, unfortunately, has all the bad elements and almost none of the good stuff - here are some of the ""lowlights"":
The great Mark Kerr is taking the night off.
Igor Vochanchyn, one of the top handful of heavyweights in the world today, is paired against pro-wrestling superstar Takada, a lukewarm fighter at best but a huge crowd favorite. Igor practically has to lead him by the hand through their queasy version of ""as the ring turns"".
Gary Goodridge, an experienced UFC veteran, is paired with Yatsu, which in Japanese means ""some guy"". This is not a coincidence, as the embarassing slob-fest which ensues will show.
Satake and Ogawa, in a ""Judo vs. Karate grudge match"", demonstrate why neither Karate nor Judo has emerged as a useful discipline in mixed martial arts.
Vanderlei Silva, always fun to watch, never gets the chance to show his stuff, and neither does Gilbert Yvel, his opponent.
Even Kazushi Sakuraba, truly the crown jewel of Pride, can't relieve the boredom. Sakuraba is impressive as always, but his little flash of skill can't illuminate what is otherwise two hours of gloom and disappointment.
Even the best have bad nights, and Pride certainly had a bad one when they put on Pride 11. By all means, buy some of the other Pride tapes, but do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.",999993600,3,2827,4.867219917012448
7935729,4,B00005ASPQ,"A surprisinly good Pride, since many people on the internet expected a lot of thrown matches and tomfoolery.  Only one was a fix, two Japanese fighters, Masaaki Satake vs Naoya Ogawa.  Ogawa's evidently a really popular pro-wrestler in Japan.  His opponent was a K-1 kickboxer (K-1 is the biggest and best kickboxing organization in the world), but mysteriously, Satake chose to slap at his opponent, instead of punching.  In addition, Ogawa won by a submission early in the second round, the 'fixed-fight-finish' in Pride - that's how questionable fights that Japanese pro-wrestlers win end.  Another Japanese former pro-wrestler, an aging Yoshiaki Yatsu, made his MMA debut, against Gary Goodridge, a former world champion arm-wrestler and Golden Gloves boxer.  Goodridge hit Yatsu repeatedly with uppercuts that would have knocked my head off and straight rights that would have turned my face inside out, but Yatsu never went down.  That's one hard-as-nails man.  An American wrestler (the real kind), Tom Erikson, formerly thought invincible, tapped out to a new and improved Heath Herring.  The most anticipated match of the evening, between kickboxers Gilbert Yvel and Vanderlei Silva, ended quickly in a 'no contest' due to illegal strikes, disappointingly.  Anyway, a list of matches: Alexander Otsuka vs Mike Bourke -- Naoya Ogawa vs Masaaki Satake -- Igor Vovchanchin vs Nobuhiko Takada -- Kazushi Sakuraba vs Shannon Ritch -- Heath Herring vs Tom Erickson -- Gary Goodridge vs Yoshiaki Yatsu -- Akira Shoji vs John Renken -- Vanderlei Silva vs Gilbert Yvel.  There might be one more, but I can't think of it right now.",993081600,3,1630,5.206896551724138
