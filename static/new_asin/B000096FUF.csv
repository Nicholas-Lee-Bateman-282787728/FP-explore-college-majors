7989798,2,B000096FUF,"This is a good documentary about John Lee Hooker. However, it's best to rent this dvd, due to the mediocre concert performance by Hooker. This is understandable, though, considering Hooker's advanced age. There are simply too many musicians on the stage with him, and he barely touches his guitar. The setlist is unimpressive. The documentary portion of this dvd is very interesting, mostly due to Eric Clapton's comments, which are insightful and informative. The bonus material with Clapton being interviewed about his love for the Blues and his first time hearing Hooker is a real treat, as well. Eddie Kirkland, Johnnie Johnson, and John Hammond should have had some more screen time on this dvd.",1216512000,2,700,5.095652173913043
7989799,3,B000096FUF,"ok. im a big fan of the hook. i mean it.  i was stoked to order this DVD after reading a bunch of 5 star reviews... but this film is anything but a comprehensive look back at the king of boogie.  it does have its bright spots... its john lee hooker for god's sake. but instead of reveling in the long, awesome carreer of the hook, it focuses on some of his last performances... which he seems to be more of a side man (he doesnt even play guitar for most of them).  i really wonder why they even chose to show the clip of his daughter singing with him... you will see what i mean when you watch it.(it makes him seem senile and out of it) again, it does have its moments... some great interviews and short performances (all interrupted... come on...) but i really expected more.... if it wasn't john lee hooker... this rating would be only 2 of 5 stars... rent it, and be prepared.",1114041600,17,881,4.201183431952662
7989800,5,B000096FUF,"It's hard, if not impossible, to sum up John Lee Hooker's life and influence on the musical world.  The world is a better place because of Mr. Hooker and this film gives us a rare glance into his mystical world.  Fascinating!",1093996800,2,225,4.463414634146342
7989801,5,B000096FUF,"This is one of the best documentary's I have seen of a great blues artists. There are interviews with about anyone who's anybody in blues, it shows the compassion and love of the music of the man. Plus great interviews with John, you can really see what his music is all about and his style a must have.",1076803200,2,303,4.241379310344827
7989802,5,B000096FUF,"I had the pleasure of meeting John Lee Hooker in the early 1980s. He was checking into a hotel and I heard the man next to me say, ""I give you this (a GOLD American Express card, rare at the time) and you give me a room."" Without looking, I said ""That must be John Lee Hooker."" and turned to him and said ""You have no idea of how much pleasure your music has given me."" We had a moment. A few months later I saw him perform solo with his pignose amp in the statuary garden at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC. This video captures the John Lee Hooker I knew, still a mystery, still a voice that symbolizes the blues, and still a poet among men. Most of the footage is from the years before his recent death and there is precious little to explain how this solo artist came to be able to put together a band that could fill stadiums and satisfy the crowd every time. He was magic, mysterious and the essence of soul and yet a very sexy and friendly man who must have suffered for his art. He was a survivor among many who died along the road and a man among men. I can only hope to be remembered as warmly as he will be. He knew who he was and what he was and he thrived on it.",1056672000,14,1174,3.916317991631799
