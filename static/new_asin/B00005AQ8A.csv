7935517,5,B00005AQ8A,"A phenomenal movie that takes crucial issues in singapore society (like productivity of the individual, capitalism, mental health, and social hierarchies) and situates the commentary within a metaphor that is ultimately literalized: loving someone forever, even in death. very powerful. Eric Khoo's first feature is definitely a spectacle.",1449619200,,339,6.083333333333333
7935518,5,B00005AQ8A,"This film illustrates loneliness and an inability to communicate. It is a slice of life film which uses the traditional Asian dramatic structure. This implies a lack of conflict, but emphasizes people and setting. While certain shots may be long and still, it contributes to the beauty of the pacing of this film. This is a thoroughly emotional and tender film, reminiscent of films by Wong Kar Wai. It must also be recognized that this is the director's first feature length film, and this provocative film marks a fine start to a career.",1352246400,,539,4.806451612903226

7935520,5,B00005AQ8A,"I totally 100% agree with ""bccheung's"" review on this movie! Couldn't have said it better myself! Well put and so true!
This movie may not be for everyone but... it should be. Anyone who has a true open mind and a true heart, will UNDERSTAND the PLOT of this movie as well as the story within itself.
Never heard of this movie before until one day recently I happened upon it while browsing one of my favorite online DVD stores. After reading the sypnopsis, I could ""feel"" this would be at the top of the list of my all time favorite Asian films/movies. After watching the movie, I was right and to this day can't seem to get this movie, the scenes, the wonderful and talented actor who portrayed ""Mee Pok"" the vendor seller of noodles out of my mind. It lingers on and on. You know it's a GREAT film/movie when one leaves such an impact in ones mind and thoughts for days on end. Truly this movie IS very thought provoking!
While reading ""bccheung's"" review of the movie, I HAD to burst out loud and say the same thing, WHY, JUST WHY...didn't Bunny tell Mee Pok the night she was hit by the car and he took her to his place, ""PLEASE CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL? Can't you see I am hurting and in pain - HELP ME!!!"" And especially later on, once she saw he was falling in love with her and she with him, ""If you love me, you will WANT to take me to the hospital to have me well again so we can spend the rest of our days together."" But I see now that upon watching this fascinating, mesmorizing, hypnotic film, that there would be NO film, no MEE POK and no story to be told had she gone to the hospital. All just part of the wonderful thought out plan by the Producer and Director! All the more reason one to see such a creative film/movie as this.
You go!! ... BCCHEUNG!!!!! :-) Really couldn't have said it better! Perfect review you gave. And... by the way... you are right... MOST people (especially in N.A.) would never understand the concept of what it's like to live, work and spend all of your life in poverty much less trying to know and understand what it must be like to be the kind of person Mee Pok is in this film.  I guess because of some issues in my own life and past, I truly can relate to Mee Pok. It doesn't take much to just get outside of your own mind and into someone elses...be sensitive for a change... get into another character...watch this movie and imagine if Mee Pok was YOU - what would YOU have done in his same situation??? Love is truly very POWERFUL - don't underestimate it!!(food for thought)! :-)
Ending note: I LOVE Asian film and I'm a caucasian woman 100% N.A. but find that it takes ""special people"" with special minds and imaginations to really love and appreciate a body of work such as this film. Other wonderful five star Asian films I recommend to any who is wanting to get into them as I have, you MUST see:  Farewell My Concubine, To Live, The Wooden Man's Bride, Ju Dou, Lust and Caution - just to name a few for starters. Once seeing these, you'll never want to go back to American films, you'll be ""hooked"" on Asian film.",1214870400,,3079,4.2615384615384615
7935521,5,B00005AQ8A,A mentally retarded young boy was secretly in love with a prostitute. One night he finds her knocked down by a car and takes her home. She might have recovered by his loving care. Unfortunately she dies. He continues to love the corpse decently.,1194307200,,245,4.590909090909091
7935522,5,B00005AQ8A,"I watched this film many years ago in HKIFF. I love it. And I am glad being able to see it again on DVD.
The majority of reviews by other customers are extremely bad. I was wondering if my taste is really so different and then realised these reviews are all from N. America reviewers. No wonder they don't get one of the main idea of the entire movie: it is about a man with super low self-image and zero self-confident. These personalities are not uncommon in Asian places because of the education, culture, competitive society etc. I am not going to talk about the cultural difference between N.A. and Asia. If you haven't seen such a weirdo, either spend a couple of years in places like Tokyo/Singapore/Hong Kong, or watch this film (because the performance of the Mee Bok Man is superior).
Background:
The story is about a lonely fish ball noodles (Mee Bok) stall cook. He has no self-confident at anything. He rarely talks. He would rather let others to take advantage of him instead of confronting. He lives in the past. For people who know him, he is a joke. For others who don't know him, he's simply a loser. He doesn't even has a name.
Bunny is a prostitute. She kills her time in Mee Bok Man's stall when she has no business. She is pretty good looking and she got more business than others in her gang. She always look for someone who can bring her away and let her start a new life, for example, her caucasian photographer boyfriend.
Mee Bok Man has a secert crush on Bunny. But he just don't have the courage to do anything except serving her Mee Bok.
Main Plot:
I can't agree to other reviewers who say there's no plot. I do agree there's one place in the plot that doesn't make a lot of sense: why not going to the hospital? The story may be simple, a bit werid, and may not be entertaining enough for Hollywood movies lovers. But it's unfair to say there's no plot.
The plot is: Mee Bok Man is always struggling for how to approach Bunny. And then one day Bunny got hit by a car. Mee Bok Man brought Bunny to his place (because Bunny can't go to the hospital??). He treats her the best.  Bunny wanna go home at the beginning, but she's just too weak. Bunny was recovering slowly. And start being moved by what Mee Bok Man has done... but at the time they fall in love with each other, Bunny dies from her injury. Mee Bok Man blames himself. He start sealing the windows, and spent the rest of the days with Bunny...
There are also some nice touches in the film like Bunny's brother revealing Bunny's dairy reverse-chronologically, the linkage between Mee Bok and Bunny, and the ending of the film.
Overall, this is one great asian art film. The plot is not perfect. But both the director and the actor did a great job in portraiting Mee Bok Man.",1068249600,6,2763,4.375486381322958
7935523,1,B00005AQ8A,"Extremely bad and poorly executed.  Filled with colorful vulgar languages and pretentious, fake accents, it is easy for viewers to see how self conscious the actors and actresses are. Eric Khoo tries too hard to be artistic and philosophical (through Bunny's diary), but turns out to be mundane and shallow.  The movie is made by a novice film maker with poor filming techniques.  Do not waste your time and money - it's a pain to watch this movie!",1041292800,,448,4.717948717948718
7935524,5,B00005AQ8A,"This is a great first feature.  Its a sad slice of life love story set in a Singapore that you'll never find in a travel brochure.  Yes it's a little first filmish, but it very well done.  Great for people who like unusual, off-beat arthouse films.",994809600,6,248,4.3478260869565215
