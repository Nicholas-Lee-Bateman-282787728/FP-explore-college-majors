It works, even on my Mac which runs Tiger, but I'm going to need to upgrade or just get a new Mac, as the OS on my computer is way out of date. The picture is crisp and clean. This Tom and Jerry cartoon is quite the mid-'80s style, even Tom's baseball cap looks '80s. I can't wait for more season sets after this one!

After all, I highly recommend this. ^_^",1367884800,,530,3.990566037735849

5551895,4,B00B1LM74O,"Yes, we all love the silly and slapsticky antics of Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, but let's face it: some of their mercurial mayhem can be a little too intense for younger viewers.  That's why there's ""Tom and Jerry Kids"", a new classic series finally running their way on to DVD for the first time !

This two-disc set contains the complete first season consisting of 13 epic episodes starring younger versions of Tom and Jerry whether they're getting along like pals, or just running around the house and beyond like their ""grown-up"" selves.  Oh, sure they can get a few bumps and boo-boos from time to time, but it's still good, wholesome entertainment for the entire family.  But you know, the duo aren't the only ones that have the attention.  These episodes also contain fun adventures starring Spike the dog with his son Tyke, and Droopy the dog with his son Dripple (Who knew ?).  And they'll take the term ""doggone funny"" to a new level.

So if you're a fan of Tom and Jerry, old or new as seen on the Cartoon Network, or even Droopy, you're definitely one to get this DVD set.  But of course, there's a similar series called ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" which also features younger versions of classic Hanna-Barbera characters, also available on DVD.  Come to think of it, I'd also like to see ""The Flintstone Kids"" on DVD, too.  Whenever that is....",1372550400,,1359,4.578512396694215
