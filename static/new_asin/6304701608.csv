Now for the movie. The book is written from the dog's perspective.  The movie is more from Heston's position. The plot was changed. The  characters in the scenes were incorrect. My 10 year old son kept nodding  his head; saying, hey, this didn't happen......",934416000,4,490,4.534090909090909

This one has him playing a really different part...more believable, but extremely realistic.

-I would disregard any other versions of this film as of this date (18.05.2012); I admit it has some dodgy editing (Buck with blood, Buck without blood, possibly different Buck, etc.) but this is a lovely film.

I gave it five stars because it arrived in the post (co-incidentally) just a day after my own German Shepherd Alita died, so there was an emotional value in it for me as well...If you don't shed a tear at least ONCE during this movie, you need to be put up against a wall and SHOT when the next revolution comes along (!!!)  :)",1337299200,,676,4.357142857142857
922179,4,6304701608,This a great video that follows the original book fairly closely.  It does leave out some key scenes but it does not change the book.

The story itself is well done, capturing the bond between man and dog very well, following London's story as well as I remember it. However, the video quality is quite poor, appearing to have been duped from an old, badly faded and scratched film copy. Some scenes have only sepia and faded purple tones remaining.

Given a better DVD copy of the original film I believe I'd rate it 4+ stars",1295740800,,691,5.97979797979798
922184,2,6304701608,"I give two stars because one star is too harsh. Call of the Wild is not the worst movie, but the quality of the dvd is very aweful like it is an archaic film which affects enjoyment of the movie. This movie is very similar to White fang : the wolf/dog, a loyal companion of the human, people saying the wolf/dog is vicious, accidently finding gold, a character falling into the ice lake and running around the fire to keep warm, enemies attacking the cabin and also lighting it on fire, wolf/dog parts with main character but reunites several times. Music and scenes are not that great.",1288742400,,586,4.485981308411215

922266,5,6304701608,"This is Jack London's classic tale about survival in the bitter north during the gold rush. If you're a mom & think this is a story for children you are mistaken. This is a story for adults about harsh conditions, harsh choices & harsh outcomes. The cast is outstanding & in great form here.

If you're unfamiliar with the story I say great go get the book at a library or buy your own & read it. The movie is 5 stars but the book is greater & it's the book that is the classic. The movie rides the books tail. All will find something to learn, something to admire & something to detest about this story. Don't miss yours. I've purposefully left out any story detail & hope you get to it before someone else tracks through your virgin snowfall. Enjoy! Movie gets 5 Stars.",1265673600,2,771,4.280821917808219

922268,5,6304701608,Great adaptation of the Jack London classic novel.  I just love Charleton Heston in this role.  He looks liek the rugged kind of man you would see in Alaska back then and even now.,1213747200,,180,4.264705882352941
922269,4,6304701608,"If you like Jack London's The Call of The Wild, then you'll probably love this internationally cast, (dubbed, save Charlston Heston) and earnest adaptation of the classic fiction with shanghied german shepherd, Buck, sold into the 19th Century Yukon dog trade, where he finds guidance and companionship in dog sled mail rider, John, (Heston). What appears to be a small budget for the film, does remarkably well in capturing the crude and bawdy Yukon gold rush boom towns, and the genuinely wintery and snowy northern wilderness. The film pulls no punches in delivering the violent aspects of the book, (the dog trade is crude and ugly), and animal star, Buck, (as himself, the credits say), would make Lassie proud.",1168473600,3,716,5.025210084033613
922270,4,6304701608,"I see there have been some negative views on this particular film on which I disagree. Of the many remakes following after, I have to say, this one is the best of the bunch. I guess I'm a Charlton Heston fan die-hard. I simply like the man; think I've seen most of what he has done. In his acting--can't say a bad thing about him.
I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for the longest time, so why haven't I gotten it yet? Guess I'm waiting for the right time. At the moment, the price seems to be right. Perhaps after the New Year, that will be the right time. There are a couple of other movies I'd like to get first.
Call of the Wild is a classic people. I guess I just was brought up right---to appreciate the 'films of yesteryear',---like my mother. She appreciated them too. And she did have a few favorites. And I share some of those favorites, but this one--no. This one's just for me, dispite the it's somewhat an oldie, sort of--in a way, from my point of view.
But in Call of the Wild, it really isn't Heston that's the star, it's the dog who potrays Buck. He's the one who more or less, 'runs away with show/bone', so to speak. Early on in the film, Buck feet bleeds and is made booties until he can take the pace. And after a while Buck prooves he can stand on his own; his love for John is unyielding. Between man & dog, it is a powerful story; what a man won't do for a dog and what a dog won't do for a man. Food for thought.

922271,5,6304701608,"This wonderfully naturalistic movie is not for the weak at heart. The story line was taken from Jack London's adventures in his own life experiences. Charlton Heston did an absolutely wonderful job acting out the part, Buck the dog made the entire movie perfect! So this movie more than deserves the 5 stars! This story was taken from the late 1800's during the great gold rush days, hard core times for many men... it's not supposed to be easy on the emotions!",1164499200,9,461,4.634146341463414
922272,1,6304701608,"The book was wonderful.  I was looking forward to showing the movie to my class, the one with Charlston Heston.  It is really bad, does not stay with the book, bad editing, very bad acting, except by the dog.  The class and I were disappointed.",1115596800,,244,4.377777777777778
922273,2,6304701608,"Imagine my sense of serendipity when, having just finished reading Jack London's classic ""Call of the Wild"" with my 9-year-old, I found this DVD release on sale for a dollar!  (Some company called Double D has just released a series of ""classic"" films, TV shows and cartoons at this rock-bottom price.)  Well, let me say it was worth the buck (pun not intended), but just barely.  My son enjoyed watching it, but mainly because he's just finished the book.  He had fun pointing out the incosistencies with the book, too.  (It only took a 9-year-old to figure that out.)  First and foremost, John Thornton becomes the main character throughout the story, rather than near the end as in the book.  (I guess Heston wanted a bigger part.)  But enough about that.  If it weren't for Heston (not my favorite actor, but by far the best one in the film), this wouldn't be worth the plastic it was burned on.  The ""international cast"" (I've learned to beware of that label ever since watching those Robert Halmi miniseries fiascos on TV) are unknowns, and rightfully so, and the dubbed-in dialogue for the foreign-speaking actors is even worse.  The soundtrack - early 70's bad electronic - is atrocious.  And the DVD was apparently copied from a scratchy print.  Lastly, as mentioned by other reviewers, this is not a film (or story, for that matter) for very young children.  There is mild profanity and moderate violence, particularly the dogfights, which were so vicious that I hope ""no animals were harmed in the making of this picture."" It desrves at least a PG.  But it is, apparently, the only version of the story on DVD (or VHS?).  So if you really want a rather bowlderized version of a classic story for a dirt-cheap price, or if you'll watch Charlton Heston in anything, by all means buy it.

(P.S.: If you want to see a Jack London tale done well, buy or rent the 1991 film ""White Fang"", starring Ethan Hawke and Klaus Maria Brandauer.)",1108944000,8,1941,4.678466076696165
922274,3,6304701608,"this charleton heston version is not the only version of this

famed novel in movie form.

some years ago, the 'family' channel' aired ""call of the wild"" starring rutger hauer. i don't know if it was made for tv  or what but it was outstanding--superb!!--one of the finest animal movies of all times. moved one to tears and the dob used to portray ""buck"" was superb.

i just cant say enough about the movie--i have an old copy and watch if all the time. it so sooooo moving

ive never seen a rendition of a jack london movie this good--its riple better than ethan hawke in white fang and i love that movie too.

it would rate a 12 on a scale of 1-10. the music to the rutger hauer version alone was worth the movie--incredible--

if anyone knows where one can get copy this tv movie better

share it bc these people on here watching the heston version

are missing out one of the greatest animal movie versions ever.

the hauer version is stunning photography, incredible hautning music scoree and simply oustanding performances.

922355,4,6304701608,"True to the book by Jack London, the dog Buck is kidnapped and taken to Alaska to be a team dog.  Buck is not a purebred German Shepard but a mix with Rottweiler.  Unlike the book, there are women in Alaska - prostitutes and saloon keepers.  Buck develops a loyalty to Charlton Heston.  The lighting of the DVD is deliberately toned down.  On a bet, Buck proves he can haul 500 pounds on a sled which keeps him from being shot in the head.  Out in the wild, he makes off with a female wolf, who has a litter of his puppies.  Charlton Heston, panning for gold, is killed and buried in the snow and ice.  Buck attacks the attackers.  Like the book, Buck joins a pack of wolves at the end, abandoning any human contact.  There is not a lot of blood, only to show that Buck has prevailed.  Buck has found freedom at last.",1098144000,11,817,4.173076923076923

922358,1,6304701608,"It's never a good plan to make a film where the dog is named Buck and the star is called Chuck, but  this film's got more problems than that. Silly acting, weak photography, and a mediocre script that only sparks when it turns violent and nasty. In Charlton Heston's thoughtful 'In the Arena' autobiography, he considers this film ""a total failure"". He may not know good politics, but he has enough taste and sense to avoid film debacles most actors of his age have lived off for decades. So if Chuck actually writes ""please don't watch this"", listen to the man. Or listen to Paramount Studios, which shelved this film after they saw it.
""The Call of the Wild"" is not unwatchable, but it's bad enough, one of the worst movies in Heston's career. Place this on the Turkey shelf next to Heston's equally bad ""The Awakening"", a ridiculous 1980 Exorcist/Omen knockoff. I haven't read Jack London's book, but this movie seems, um, a very loose adaptation.
The extras in the Alaska town are played by an assortment of German/Italian/British/American/Spanish actors, mostly overdubbed. What gems they say: one jumps onto a bicycle and yells ""Yippee! Yippeeeee!"" (Note: ""Yippee!"" will never be acceptable in a Hollywood script, and is punishable if done in real-life.) Heston's human co-star runs into that same town, yelling ""Hi! Hi! Hi!"" like a stoner coming down from the mountain commune. If all of the movie was as corny as the townspeople, we might have had a comedy for the ages. Alas.
As amusing as the vomiting town drunkard was, it was Charlton Heston, always a powerful presence, who kept me watching. He looks a little grumpier than usual, perhaps he noticed that the many wolves in the film are actually hybrid dogs that don't look much like North American wolves. However, his scenes with Buck are touching, against all odds and logic. I never thought of actors having on-screen chemistry with animals, but Heston proves it does exist. Those scenes keep the film from being a complete waste of film stock, but there aren't nearly enough of them.
Still, this dull film contains one classic Chuck Heston line - words he was born to speak: ""Mister, if you touch that dog again I'm gonna shoot ya!"" Yippee!",1024704000,11,2208,4.7952755905511815
