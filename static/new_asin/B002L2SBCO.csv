All in all it does not have enough Carthage content for the video to have it as its center piece.  It is more about the Phoenicians with secondary educational aspects relating to Carthage. Unless you have a good base knowledge of the Mediterranean and its history this video may move too fast for you. I have sailed the Med extensively and know its background and history.  Maybe that's why I question its content. But I will give it a ""one thumb up!"" for the antique black and white early film footage of the fighting and battle scenes from very old movies.",1316649600,,649,4.483050847457627
8372347,4,B002L2SBCO,"Truly poor reproduction on a fascinating subject.  I ordered the ""Mycenaeans"", ""Minoans"", ""Phoenicians/Carthage"", and ""Thera/Santorini"" dvds.  First delivery had no narrative, only music.  One of the 4 dvds had no visual. The 4 dvds AS A WHOLE went back and forth to Amazon 3x before I got a decent (i.e., viewable) item.  However, they are ONLY viewable on my TV dvd player; they will not play on my HP Pavilion pc. The audio is ""underwater"", like they were submerged.  Hard to hear the narrative above the music.  Nutty, really.  Truly poor electronics.  Very frustrating.  And -- I used a LOT of postal tape.  However, I love the subject matter and I wanted very much to see these capsule takes on these cultures.  Was it worth it?  Yeah, but I need more tape. I was not reimbursed for that.

  Along with these 4 dvds, I ordered ""The Celts:  A Journey Back in Time (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)"".  This, too, was defective.  However, they sent a copy and a duplicate, simultaneously.  I AM STILL trying to get a refund for the duplicate (which, of course, I sent back.  More tape.)

  Very surprising -- I've never had such problems with the quality of Amazon's products before (re dvds).  They were VERY GRACIOUS and replaced eveything, sending out new items immediately.  But -- as you can see -- the process got messed up and confusion reigns.  Time out of my life; time NOT spent watching the dvds.",1307059200,,1414,4.669387755102041
