3774682,5,B001RE9HGQ,"Saw the production in 2002 in San Francisco after gearing up with the Nagano/Salzberg production on CD that had just surfaced at the time on DG. That box set contributed to many's fascination with the brilliant Messiaen.

Gorged on this opera a few times in a great breakthrough production with Sir Willard White as Saint Francis.  The whole thing was incredible beyond words.  Hoping to see the production commercially available - but never materialized.

Been waiting since then for any DVD of this Opera to become available, but began to think it would ever be released  -- even though the piece had some momentum at the time. Even if it was released, was afraid it would fall short of the potential due to the complexity of the production and difficulty to the performers.

However, this DVD is in a class by itself, I concur with the other reviewers ""TC"" and ""Paolo"" - who have done a great job detailing the accomplishment.

Having this release in the catalog at this quality and level of commitment is a major achievement -- a thrill -- moreover OPus ARTE and Pierre Audi have reached a pinnacle that may never be matched on DVD ever again.",1244160000,16,1147,4.676616915422885
3774683,5,B001RE9HGQ,"Messiaen spent eight years creating Saint Francois d'Assise, his only opera and one he probably understood that (for an host of reasons) would prove something of a trial for both performer and audience.  But, man of faith that he was, he also must have sensed that, for anyone willing to go along with him for the ride (and it is as inexorable one as any I've been on) - there is much to love, and yes, rejoice in.  Now, after 25 years, the work has finally made it onto commercial video and the three disc set for OpusArte could not be more welcome than they are right now.

As much as I love Messiaen the beginning of this score has always been something of a tough row to hoe.  I have a mild impatience at the sameness of the orchestration with which Messiaen begins, a seemingly endless, unrelenting twofold `smear"" created by the striking of a loud chord, followed by a downward glissando: Yahhhhhhhh---da!  This sort of falls into a universal rhythm that returns throughout the opera:  a couple of sung (often unaccompanied) words, followed by that ""yaahhhhhhh-da!""  This effect is then punctuated by a fury of wild rhythmic punches from the entire orchestra, winds, brass, bells, strings, percussion - all of it comes blasting past your ears at once.  Ah, but if we stick with it we find a ""miracle"" just waiting to happen - and happen it does.  Having heard this score many times over the past 25 years, my reaction has almost always been the same:  prickly annoyance until Messiaen and his forces beat me into submission resulting in one of those ""aha!"" moments.  (How very religious!)

In the title role, Rod Gilfry provides his own miracle. It is one of the greatest assumptions of a role I can recall witnessing.  I never once felt Gilfry to be playing Francois so much as inhabiting entirely Messiaen's vision of the beloved saint, and making him his own.  While other Francois (including Jose van Dam, the creator of the role) have been equally firm of voice and capable of singing this remarkably difficult music, Gilfry crosses a line they did not.  Into this often austere music, he injects a Francois as full of joy as he is contemplation and seeking, his face a remarkable mask, mirroring seemingly endless expressions - not one of them false or forced. Through voice and visage he practically ""beams"" Saint Francis out to us.

Firm of tone, equal in almost all registers, Gilfry's delivery of Messiaen's own text mixes the ""matter of fact"" declamation of his predecessors, tempered with a beauty of sound combining elegance with great emotion. I believed in Francois and his journey . . . in his every effort to humble himself to the greatest degree possible, to rid himself of every fear and doubt so as to be brought closer to his God.  It is a remarkable journey.

We see his first weakness when, to his great embarrassment he admits his repulsion for lepers.  He prays God to purify him . . . change him, so he may learn to love the lepers. That prayer is answered by the arrival of the pathetic, suffering Leper to whom Francois immediately offers comfort and peace to.  While The Leper howls of his pain, Francois shares how suffering is a trial so we may, in some small way, comprehend the suffering of Christ, making His sacrifice and love all the greater.  The Leper continues, sharing the suffering he endures at the hands of other monks.  The Angel (Camilla Tilling) appears from high above the stage, her pure and gentle message:  God loves him.  Francois interprets the Angel's message for him: Your sorrow is in your heart, and God is far greater than your heart.""  Here is some of the score's first, ""traditionally"" beautiful music and Messiaen could not possibly have used it to finer effect - the result is overwhelming.

The Leper thanks Francois for his kindness but Francois admits, ""I have not loved you enough"" and, raising the diseased wretch's head to his own, kisses him, encircling him in his arms. Here, Gilfry's face radiates pure love and tears well in his eyes - and suddenly:  The Leper is healed.  I found myself so completely overwhelmed a break was necessary before continuing with Act II.

Though Act II runs just shy of two hours, its three scenes played out almost before I realized they were over.  The first two scenes are dominated by the presence of The Journeying Angel and his interactions - dazzling and beautiful - with Frres Masse, Elie and Francois.  The 3rd scene (Tableau 5) is the famous ""sermon to the birds"" and here the stage becomes filled with color, children, puppets on a set filled with crudely made trees of 2X4s on which Frres Masse, Francois and the children write the names of (and draw) the birds of which they sing. The children take to some fanciful street art which later creates a magical special effect at the end of the scene.

Director Pierre Audi sets the massive stage alive - placing the enormous Hague Philharmonic center stage, set among acres of scaffolding, platforms and an enormous open dome above the stage from which the chorus sometimes sings, (and which fills magically with stars upon Francois' death). Stacks of of wooden crosses separate the orchestra from the central playing area, a raised platform between all the scaffolding. Angelo Figus' costumes are elaborate takes on ancient liturgical looking robes, of stunning yet crude construction and looking of skins and feathers.  Each Monk's is rich with color, tied with wrist-thick ropes and envelop each brother like a living sarcophagus. Upon receiving his stigmata, and in preparation for his death, the barefoot Francois sheds his final robe (rich, black) to finish the ""opera"" clad only in a simple white gown, symbolic of his attainment of grace and purity.  It's a simple, yet powerful effect.

As a great fan of Tom Randle. it was especially nice to see him cast in the important role of Frres Masse, injecting (along with the children) a bit of levity into some otherwise very lofty proceedings.  His voice still marvelously expressive and he remains (for me) one of the very best actors to be found in opera.

Not as beautiful of voice as Randle, but also marvelously expressive is Hubert Delamboye as The Leper.  His transformation scene is powerful and the sense of joy shared by him and Francois upon it one of the opera's most powerful and emotional scenes.

Smooth voiced, Henk Neven is affecting as Frre Lon, as is Donald Kaasch Frre Elie (if a bit wide of vibrato).

Maestro Ingo Metzmacher does the near impossible keeping together the massive forces of the cast, the Hague Philharmonic and De Nederlandse Opera Chorus in what can only be deemed as an absolutely thrilling reading of Messiaen's magnum opus.  The wildly divergent sounds they are required to achieve - muscular, bold, provocative come through loud and clear, but they also provide many moments of truly rapturous beauty.  This is evident nowhere more so than the final chorus, - staged magnificently.  As Francois ""disappears"" the chorus rises to the front, like witnesses of a medieval pageant - but also providing the voice of God - as a blazing, golden light suffuses everything, and the stars twinkle above all through the dome - a window to heaven - in what is perhaps the loudest crescendo in all of western music.  The effect created here is truly otherworldly. breathtaking and sui generis - feeling both like a coupe de theatre - and a holy rite.

I must again single out Rod Gilfry's performance.  Onstage for four plus hours (and in all but one scene) he provides consistently beautiful singing, a commitment and intensity that is - from start to finish - nothing short of remarkable.  He IS Francois.

3774684,5,B001RE9HGQ,"Although he liked opera and delved into the operas of Mozart and Wagner, Messiaen never thought he would compose an opera himself because he believed that he is incompetent to do so. But after receiving a request for a new opera from the Paris opera, and with the encouragement of the French President Georges Pompidou he began working on his only operatic work Saint Franois d'Assise in 1975. He wrote the libretto and writing of the music continued until 1979. Orchestration of the new opera extended until 1983 and in this year, the opera was presented for the first time in Paris.

This month appeared on the Opus Arte label a new DVD version for Messiaen's opera that was recorded in June 2008 at the Dutch opera in Amsterdam (De Nederlandse Opera). The opera is set in the 13th century, and deals with episodes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi: He teaches his fellow friars, heals a leper, has an encounter with an angel, gives a sermon to the birds, hears the sound of Christ and than receives the Stigmata and dies.

The opera is an enormous creation that lasts for over four hours and was written for a mammoth orchestra that includes nine percussion players, a huge choir and nine soloists. This opera has a meditative and philosophical character and expresses a deep religious feeling. Messiaen used in the opera a variety of the composition techniques that he was using during his life like birdsong, elements of Serialism, plainchant etc. Relatively to the length of the opera, there are not too many occurrences. The drama moves on a very slow time scale and is quite static. In this aspect reminds me of Wagner's Parsifal. The third act is the more dramatic part of the work.

The vocal writing for the singers derives from the French operatic tradition at the beginning of the 20th century - echoes of Debussy and especially it reminds me of the Ravel and Poulenc's operatic music. But in the orchestral writing it is definitely Messiaen's own sound that is familiar from other works I know like the Turangalla-Symphonie. The vocal writing for the singers is in general slow and without pathos. Expressions of the emotion are very limited and almost everything is sung with some kind of a stoic tranquility. In particular the friars singing sounds more like ecclesiastical hymns than as operatic dialogues and monologues.

In contrast with the singing, the orchestral music is extremely vigorous, and complex. There are quite a few orchestral interludes. The orchestral sound is rich and varied and there is a great use of a big battery of percussion instruments from the xylophone family (xylophone, xylorimba, marimba, glockenspiel and vibraphone) especially in the first act. In the second act there is a long scene that deals Saint Francis preaching to the birds. Here Messiaen that was also an ornithologist, expresses his love for birds music and the orchestra mimics very impressively the sounds of different birds. In this act he makes a very prominent use of string glissandi that creates a special and bizarre feeling. In the first scene of the third act, where Saint Francis receives the stigmata, the orchestral sound becomes extremely vociferous and harsh and here one can hear clearly the sound of three Ondes Martenot (Messiaen said about this instrument that it is 'very rare in an opera!').

And now to the new DVD from Amsterdam:

Pierre Audi, which is one of my favorite opera directors, directed the opera in Amsterdam. Like in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen that he directed in the Dutch opera ten years ago, the colossal orchestra sits in center the stage and everything actually occur around it. The decor is made of a system of scaffolding and other items and has an abstract character that is quite hard to describe. There are a few other simple additional elements like trees or a big pile of metal crosses. Everything is symbolic and hinted. Normally with Audi, the costumes are made of crude and simple wool, and have a raw look. In Amsterdam Saint Francis gives his sermon to the birds that are actually children that are painting birds...

The Hague philharmonic orchestra is conducted by Ingo Metzmacher and undoubtedly he controls brilliantly this massive forces. The Chorus of De Nederlandse Opera contributes impressively in particular in the first scene of the third act when Saint Francis receives the stigmata. What an overwhelming piece of music this is!

The leading role St. Francis is sung by baritone Rodny Gilfry. This is an extremely difficult and exhausting role. He sings for almost three hours. In the interview with him that exists in the DVD he tells that this role was almost impossible to memorize and this is the most difficult role in his entire career. For my taste he is very impressive in particular in the last scene. Another excellent singer is soprano Camilla Tilling in the role of the angel. She has a beautiful voice with pure high notes. British tenor Tom Randle is very good as Frre Masse. Dutch baritone Henk Neven is an excellent Frre Lon. And one should mention Hubert Delamboye singing in the short but significant role of The Leper.

To sum up: This is a powerful rendition of a great opera, but it takes a lot of concentration and patience to enjoy it.
Highly recommended for those who like this kind of music.",1238198400,58,5306,4.834801762114537
8337776,5,B001RE9HGQ,"Impressive in almost every aspect, this performance is almost 4 1/2 hours long playing time. There are 120 players in the orchestra, including woodwinds and tuned percussion, and the chorus has 150 voices.  Combine that with an impressive staging, filming, and solo voices, and you get an amazing result. The music is purely Messiaen, so it cant be put in one box - there is almost everything for everyone.
I was particularly moved by the sonority of the orchestra that produced everything from scary knock on the door music (scene 4) to bird song music (scene 6).  The music recording is excellent and conveys the immensity of the sound. The music themes repeat themselves in great amount, so although they are not the tonal melodic type, they become familiar to the ear and allow the abstract and religious libretto to be well conveyed.
The staging is centered on the protagonists with many crosses surrounding the center of the stage. In addition, the full big orchestra is on stage behind the crosses. It does have some interesting effect.
Of note is a camera placed on top of the stage.  The shots filmed through it give a very special effect that I have seldom seen.
This is an opera with almost no dramatic plot, which, combined with music of various types and the long duration, seems to me a very difficult proposition for the stage.  This recording allowed me to watch it scene by scene over several days, which I believe gave me a better chance to appreciate it than would have been possible in a single sitting at the opera house.
The extras include a short interview with the children who performed as the birds. Very honest and cute kids!
I don't know of any other video recording available, so if you are interested in this late 20th century opera, I strongly recommended this recording.",1470182400,2,1802,4.729299363057325

8337778,3,B001RE9HGQ,"Another reviewer has stated it so well, that I cannot but rpeat his comments: No to the cacophony that some people call music.  No to the slow pace, which makes it seem an oratorio, not a real opera. Superb singers and production.  I have had to take long breaks between records, because it was all too much to deal with.  As far as ""Catholic"" operas go, I'd rather listen to Murder in the Cathedral or Dialogues of the Carmelites, my absolute favorite.",1435536000,,453,4.5
8337779,5,B001RE9HGQ,"We have just seen a Francis enthroned in the chair of Peter. Pope Francis the First proclaims his own inspiration to come from Francis of Assisi, they are both unique and so is Messiaen's great celebration of the saint, but it hardly gets a performance, and when it does (as in London recently) hardly anyone attends. Meantime Verdi and Wagner, neither of whom ever goes short of an audience, are being doubly feted simply for having been born, like much of humanity, in a year ending with the digits 13. Messiaen's masterpiece must be frightening people off I suppose; but if so let me say `Be not afraid.' This superb production ought to save a few musical souls, as surely as Frre Leon was redeemed from his early timidity, crying repeatedly `J'ai peur de la route.'

I believe that there is at least one fine cd version of Saint Francois, but it's important to see as well as hear this work. The staging is my idea of excellent, not quite minimalist but austere in keeping with its theme. Lighting is monochrome to start with, colour later adding warmth when the angel plays her solo to the overwhelmed and nearly unconscious Francis, then during the famous `sermon' to the birds and again during the magnificent triumphal finale. The monastic robes of the Friars Minor are suitably rough looking, and the angel's finery is eye-catching without being out of keeping. The odd man out in this respect is the leper, but he has to be strongly characterised, so I have no problem with his stylised leper's rags. No real attempt is made to have the various actors `look their part'. Rod Gilfry in the title role in particular is a fine rugged Califorrnian with Hollywood looks. However I for one have to suspend so much disbelief on being fed with so much Catholic mysticism that I am not looking for plausibility in minor respects. The orchestra and chorus are actually within camera range, but all one can really see is a distant back view of the conductor, and that suits me fine.

One touch of fresh thinking, very successful so far as I'm concerned, is the so-called sermon to the birds. This is really more a kind of lecture to the birds, telling them about themselves. What this production does is make it into a class on ornithology given to a stageful of children. These act their part very well, and the birdsongs are of course entrusted to the composer's practised orchestration, represented as he usually represents them through a lifetime of fascination with the musicians that he believes the finest of all and the most in direct contact with the deity. This being a dvd, the sound has to come through my B-speakers, but I have no complaints with it. It is clear, it is vivid, and it is typical Messiaen. It is even extra-typical in one respect, in having no fewer than three ondes martenot, their players given individual recognition in the liner. These queer contraptions would hardly fit in Wagner, but this is Messiaen and he understands them.

The vocalists cover themselves with distinction, and I include the chorus, who have a lot to do in the final tableau and have to turn out a super-Handelian climax at the very end. There is no problem with tone quality anywhere that I noticed. All the soloists are excellent, but of course everything depends on Francis and the angel. Gilfry is superb, and even his French sounds good to me. Camilla Tilling has the solitary female role, and she brings it off with aplomb, giving a new meaning to the clich `pure as angels'. The work as a whole calls for a surprising amount of acting, but in the absence of duels, triumphal marches, love scenes and whatnot the acting is largely a matter of facial expression seen in closeup, and that devolves more or less entirely on Gilfry. He may not look anyone's idea of St Francis, but he does really quite well without being any obvious candidate for an acting Oscar or a BAFTA award.

This is the story of the progress of a soul towards closer union with God, in the fashion so beloved of mediaeval ideas of the religious life. To me the miracles, angels and such like are fairy tales and the mysticism is fantasy and make-believe. However from anything that I have read about Olivier Messiaen this was very much not his outlook and he seems to have swallowed the whole spiritual repast like some mind-altering meal that did not need drugs or substances. In addition he is a great composer, if you can take him at all, and I own up to being a bit of a Messiaen-junkie myself. I am perfectly ready to enter into his world so far as I can, and I do not find the `plot'of this drama in any way static but on the contrary deeply involving. As well as the music Messiaen wrote the libretto, but the music is the thing here. I suppose that its failure to draw the public so far is down to some combination of M's general musical style together with the overly repeated canard about supposed lack of `action' or static scenes. It does not take much familiarity to dispel the latter view although the work must be as long as Goetterdaemmerung, and it could even be that this, of all M's compositions, may actually win over some music lovers who have yet to respond to, say, Turangalila or the Eclairs de l'Au-dela.

There are a few little extras on the first disc. The cast-list and the heads of the musical numbers just duplicate the liner, and the spoken summary is very little different. However there are some interesting short interviews, in English, Dutch and German, including a talk with the children. I recommend this before you start the actual opera. It might put you in the right mood.

8337780,3,B001RE9HGQ,"Of all the opera dvd's I've watched in the last year or so (which is many), this one sets me up with my biggest dilemma- because I'm so divided about it.  Music- NO, opera- NO, performance and production- a big YES.  I'll elaborate.

Olivier Messiaen is one of the major 20th century French composers who worked in a complex musical language- dissonances, atonal, multi-harmonic, etc.  I'm familiar with some of his songs, but little of his orchestral output, which is his major work.  This is his only operas, commissioned by Paris Opera in 1975 and completed in 1983.  It is a bout the life of Saint Francis on Assisi.  It is a difficult work to get into- at least for me.

The music is harsh, with many dissonances, and striking percussive elements, especially the many xylophone-like instrumental passages.  It is apparently very hard to sing (Rodney Gilfry in his interview so indicates), and I didn't find it any easier to listen to.  Without going on at length, the music was a very difficult and not enjoyable for me.  Without a tune, I couldn't hold onto anything.  No apologies here- it just doesn't work for me at all.

The opera?  Well, it is a series of scenes or tableaux, rather than a lineal story, focusing on key myths of Franc's life.  For me this is not a problem.  I've enjoyed many operas that don't have a strong story element to them (""Nixon in China"" is one, for example, and there are others.)  Here, there a few scenes that really worked for me (the leper scene and the final death scenes), and others just didn't have enough to them. And, again, musically they were a struggle for me as well.

This is also a religious piece, with very strong liturgical aspects to the story, character, etc.  But, not being a Christian, these aspects didn't touch me either- I'm not a religious person, and the stories of the saints don't affect me.  So this fundamental element to this piece also didn't work for me.

So, what's left?  A fantastic performance and dvd production.  First the performance..

This is a very big piece.  It clocks in at over four hours, and has a chorus of over 150 and an orchestra of over 100 persons.  VERY BIG!  The staging was excellent!  Opera Netherlands is to be commended for taking on this monumental work and pulling nit off extremely well.  The director, Pierre Audi, really handled all aspects very smoothly. (He likes to put the orchestra on the stage, as he did with his Ring Cycle, but it is off to the side and not very visible or in the way.  I don't think it adds anything to the production, but I'll give him his druthers.  Maybe it makes the music and performance better.)  The movements of the characters, the skeleton staging surrounding the central area, the movement of the chorus- all worked very well for me.

Rodney Gilfry as Saint Francois was fantastic- powerful, moving, effective.  I've seen him live, and this captured his performance very well indeed.

Finally, I must mention the Netherlands chorus.  Kudos to them!!  They were the highlight of the dvd for me. I'm sure it took a lot of work for them to learn this difficult score- and they were terrific, and the chorus director Martin Wright.

Finally, the dvd itself.  The video, and sound were outstanding, even without a blu ray edition. Subtitles were perfect.  There were a few small extras- interview with Gilfry, the children (quite fun as they didn't get the music at all) and conductor/director.  I would have liked more, but what I got was good enough.

So, a split decision for me.  Terrific performance of a work that I didn't really like.",1363651200,4,3580,4.64274322169059
8337781,5,B001RE9HGQ,"Today, I finally put my fears behind me and permitted myself to establish my first contact with the totally different and peculiar music (to say the least) by Olivier Messiaen through his opera Saint Franois d'Assise in DVD. It was a big surprise for me! It has awesome and new sounds (sometimes frightening ) for our ears, angelical solos by an angel , very interesting effects produced by the strings, great choruses, a moving interpretation by baritone Rod Gilfry and a very apotheotical end!

The scene with the curing of the leper was one of the most cathartic experiences I have ever had.  No wonder Messiaen was so ardently Catholic... this story is so beautiful and graceful that it had me thinking about conversion.
Rod Gilfry should obviously be commended for his endurance and vocal prowess as other reviewers have mentioned, but I was blown away even moreso by his acting chops.  Something one learns to accept after years of watching opera is that diva/o's chronically overact. Mr. Gilfry outdid himself with an elegance and austerity complementing Messiaen's insistent but glacially-paced score.  The tears that he shed as he embraced the leper could not have been more real or affecting.
The DVD is worth it for this scene alone.",1282780800,4,914,4.915584415584416

About 1/3 (my guesstimate) were as spellbound as me. A few hollered in protest or walked out - a good sign that here is something to get your teeth (not exactly, let's say your mind & heart) into.

The music is top Messiaen. I have no idea how to describe it, it's so extraordinarily inventive, moving & unlike anything else. For me it is a work of heart & mind & I suppose I should add the obvious: soul.

But one doesn't have to be religious (I am far from that!) to appreciate % love this work. The story is dramatic but there is humor too. The performers are just fine; Gilfry is a wonder in every aspect of this, I imagine, difficult role. - I could quibble about the scenery, but it works well enough. Besides I am not one who goes to operas for the sets & costumes.

That just about sums it up from my point of view.  I bought it because I am always trying to expand my experience and knowledge of opera.  But this work feels as if it goes on as long as Messiaen took to write it.  Comparatively it makes the longeur bits of ""Die Meistersinger"" seem to be written by Rossini.  I am not saying that I regret having bought it, despite the price; but I would like to emphasise that it is not everybody's cup of tea.
