8334498,2,B001H1MXX8,"I waited a good three months for the release of this DVD and ordered it the very day it became available. The first DVD I received froze-up approximately one hour into the program. I tested it on three separate DVD players, and the program froze in the same place on each deck. I immediately returned the DVD for a replacement; which Amazon handled promptly and efficiently. The second DVD arrived within a few days, but unfortunately this DVD would not load at all on any of the three DVD players I own. For $40 I expect more from a product.

As for the program itself . . . the portion I was able to watch, the information was very basic and common sense stuff. I admit, the information I was most interested in was scheduled for the latter half of the program which I was never able to see, so I can't fairly comment on that.

I am returning the 2nd defective DVD for a refund.",1279497600,,880,4.295180722891566
8334499,5,B001H1MXX8,"I decided to get this cause I got one of the other DVDs that Mr. Salman did for the Canon cameras just to see what this was like and I can say that it's a great over-view of the whole low budget movie making process with a lot of great tips. It's a long seminar, so there's not a lot going on besides him talking which is too bad, and it's a lot of information, but it's all interesting. If you want to get a good sense of what it takes to make low-budget movie this is a great DVD.",1256947200,,482,3.83
