3444284,5,B0019VRF6Q,"Llana Lloyd's outrageous true life story is simply beyond belief.  How many shocks can a girl take when she is born in the Fifties and can't explain to her friends that her mom is a racecar driver in the demoliton derby and also strutting in gay bars as a notorious figure but still married to her father? Talk about a soap opera! Llana escapes from her home life by venturing off to the Sunset Strip in Hollywood where she meets rock stars galore and becomes a groupie during the glam rock era of the 1970s. Ms. Llana Lloyd appears on dozens of talk shows and is the first child of gay parentage to come out of the closet. Angela Bowie gives Llana the gift of glamour and confidence and with that, Llana's life really starts looking up!!! A sizzling tale of survival with a blitz of glitz and glam!

3444285,5,B0019VRF6Q,"""Glitter Goddess of the Sunset Strip"" is a gutsty family tale with a lesbian mom, a groupie daughter (Llana Lloyd) and a schzophrenic father...all true and well documented. A tribute to the 1970s era of decadence with tidbits of Llana's affair with Alice Cooper, Angela Bowie (David Bowie's x-wife)and Mickey Rooney's son, Teddy Rooney.  A real blitz of glitz and incredible talk show footage with Llana being featured on talk shows galore proving that gay families do exist! Llana lives life on her on terms and has a ball breaking story to tell that will educate, thrill and give hope to those who can finally come out of a lot of closets with great pride!",1293062400,,658,4.721739130434782
8275393,2,B0019VRF6Q,"This was a rather boring film about Llana Lloyd who was a ""mental groupie"" and Hollywood beat reporter. She was messed up as a child, or not messed because her mother was the ""most sought after lesbian in Orange County."" She drove demolition derby, had different girlfriends all while the schizophrenic dad lived in the house. Llana claims Alice Cooper was her therapist. She also idolized Angie Bowie to the point of nausea.

The film is a docu-drama which incorporates family home movies, TV interviews, and some very bad reenactments. Llana founded a kids of gay parents support group because they're not really messed up...they keep telling themselves. I did learn a new phrase I never heard before ""Nelly Kiki"" which doesn't seem to be in an on-line slang dictionaries, although it was explained in the production.

8275394,4,B0019VRF6Q,"An incredible story of survival really...llana survived a very difficult childhood, and survived the crazy 70's Hollywood scene. It's amazing that she went through all of that without losing her mind! She's an amazing person. This is a magical little time capsule.",1374969600,,264,5.309523809523809

8275397,5,B0019VRF6Q,"Llana Lloyd's tell-all is so well done! Llana seems so honest and so articulate and Lana is so beautiful! Those were some heady days and Ms. Lloyd has brought back many fascinating memories of the wild days at the Rainbow, Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco and the thrills and chills from her flashy, glamorous past! The scenes upstairs at the Rainbow were staggering!  Thank you Llana for sharing your mind-blowing, decadent and mesmerizing by-gone days of glitter and gorgeousness!

8275398,5,B0019VRF6Q,I am thrilled to see the Glitter Goddess revived!  I did the editing for this film all those years ago and was very happy to hear that the film was now available online on DVD. This is a must see for anyone interested in taking a fascinating peek into the 80's Hollywood music scene and the efforts of one woman to find her way through the many obstacles life put in her path. A true story documented with many actual film clips and personal home movies (long before digital became available). Enjoy!,1340582400,3,500,4.434782608695652

8275401,5,B0019VRF6Q,"To those of us blessed with an Ozzie and Harriet childhood home this is an amazing and almost unbelieveable true life story.  I will always be thankful for the time that I met Llana in Beverly Hills and that she is a dear friend of many years and yet until seeing this movie I did not realize how much she has overcome!  Besides being a fun Hollywood glitz movie, this is the story of a strong, spirited and creative woman who has triumphed over her past. Llana did not allow herself to be a victim of all the insanity! This movie will be inspiring to anyone dealing with past issues. You can achieve peace, happiness and love too!",1336435200,2,631,4.338983050847458
8275402,5,B0019VRF6Q,"Llana Lloyd is a true survivor.  Llana was born in a bad place at the wrong time.  However her timing got better when she turned her scars into her stars and met Alice Cooper, John Lennon, Chuck Negron of Three Dog Night...And KILLER KANE of THE NEW YORK DOLLS!  I enjoyed this autobiographical movie and particularly when Llana appears on People are Talking, a Boston talk show, a tender sensitive woman calls in and states ""I, as a mother, heard your child like voice and my heart broke for you.""  What a touching story.  I am so touched that Llana's father instinctively became the nurturer to his darling daughters.  These are not every-day ordinary people, but I can certainly relate.",1335052800,2,689,4.7
