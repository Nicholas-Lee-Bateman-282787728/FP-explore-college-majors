1889079,1,B00009RGCE,"I was in Europe and Israel around the time of the daily multiple suicide bombers, blowing up civilians in busses and restaurants, shooting people on the streets, with Arab civilians dancing in the streets afterwards -- passing out sweets to kids and calling the dead murderers ""martyrs"" -- and I asked my Jewish friends aloud ""when will Sharon do something to stop this madness"".  I could not imagine the US, for example, sitting by while Canadian terrorists did such a thing.  Finally, action was taken.  The IDF was sent out, and Jenin was one of the major targets as that's where the bomb-making factories were located. And the whole world, which previously had only been yawning with boredom at the sight of Jews being blown up and mutillated, suddenly went berzerk with indignant ""outrage"" against the Israelis.  European newspapers shouted ""MASSACRE IN JENIN"" as PA spokespersons unashamedly claimed ""thousands of civilians are being massacred"" and called upon the world to come and save them.  Nothing of the sort was happening, however, but this did not stop Amnesty International, Human Right's Watch and various UN representatives from repeating the Palestinian claims without examination.  All the Palestinian claims were reported internationally as if they were ""fact"", while all the Israeli denials were reported as ""claims"".  ""BLOODBATH"" was one headline, in bold red letters, from The Guardian, as I recall, and the UN then sent a well-known antisemite to Israel to ""investigate"".  Understandably, the Israelis refused that man entry, and also refused to allow BBC and other Left-wing ""human rights"" groups in, given their happy willingness to repeat the PA claims without reservation.  The film ""Jenin, Jenin"" basically repeats this story, up to this point.  What it does not say, however, is what happend next.  Finally an acceptable UN investigation team arrived, and so did other international human rights groups, finally to determine that something around 57 person, most of whom were militants carrying guns, had died in a hard military clash in the heart of Jenin, including 23 dead Israeli soldiers, that the IDF had used loudspeakers to warn people away, that only some buildings in the center of the heavily-fortified Jenin center were bulldozed, and there was NO MASSACRE. It was discovered that the Palestinians had dug up old graves, and planted corpses into the rubble, to inflate the death figures, and with my own eyes I saw one funny episode on Israeli television, where a coffin was dropped during a loud and angry Arab funeral outside Jenin, but the ""dead man"" inside the coffin quickly scrambled back inside.  This was caught on video.  And so forth.  Even the PA was finally forced to accept this -- but this film will not give the facts.  It is pure Arab-Islamist propaganda, in the same category as those who claim 9-11 was the product of a CIA/Mossad conspiracy.  Save your money.",1075593600,19,2920,5.077405857740586
1889080,1,B00009RGCE,"This film is a documentary of the Israeli action in the Jenin Refugee camp in 2002.  Israeli troops went charging into this camp in response to numerous terrorist bombings.  The army had intelligence that the camp was literally chalk full of terrorists and weapons.  During the fighting that ensued rumors leaked out that a `massacre' had taken place.  The western media quickly arrived and interviewed left wing Israeli activists and Palestinian `survivors'.  The Palestinians told a tale of mass graves and `genocide' and a little known Israeli Arab(Arab living in Israel) took up a crusade to `document' the `massacre'.  This film is his documentary.  It details a series of interviews of Palestinians who supposedly witnessed the Israel incursion and the subsequent battle.  These Palestinians all claim to have witnessed the mass murder of their compatriots at the hands of non-other then the butcher of Sabra and Shatilla, Arik Sharon.
Of course this is one half of the story.  The second half is that this documentary is mostly propaganda and hyperbole and does not bother to reveal the subsequent investigation by the U.N, Israel and other bodies that concluded only 30 people had been killed, almost all of whom were young men who were probably combatants.  The Investigation proved beyond doubt that a `massacre' had not taken place.  The investigations also proved that the Israeli army had gone to great lengths to not harm civilians, but due to the crowded nature of the camp some civilians had been killed, by mistake.  `Jenin Jenin' is a battle cry that was created to infuse westerners with hate towards Israel.  The documentary tries to show that Israel is a veritable `fascist' state that routinely rounds up Palestinians and massacres them. This film is almost all lies and the interviewees either were telling lies or they simply had thought they witnessed something that was incorrect.  Frequently during the fog of war it may seem that hundreds of people are being killed when in reality only a few actually die and most end up wounded from shrapnel.  This is frequently the case in a small arms fire fight, it may seem like a terrible battle but subsequent casualty lists will show it to be mostly bloodless.  The Palestinians saw hundreds of tanks and Israeli soldiers and the volume of fire certainly made them feel that a massacre was taking place.  But the documentary doesn't include any of the actual footage of the conclusions of the investigators, and its images are mostly propaganda meant to convey that terrible destruction took place when in reality a small portion of the camp was damaged.  Recommended reading to accompany this film is `Image and Reality' by Finkelstein, `Case for Israel' by Dershowitz and `The new anti-Semitism' by Foxman.  This will help balance this very biased documentary.

So creating new myths and searching for new demons is an ongoing process. How is it possible to have a State of Palestine, that competes with Israel for economic prosperity?
Jenin was simply another means within this process of eradication, a slow ""ethnic cleansing"" grabbing more land in the process with bogus construction fences(some 2 billion US dollars),to control the West Bank, that has aquifers beneath that supplies Israel and the settlements with water.
Jenin in northern West Bank, was the place of temporary unity of various militias, Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. It was for three days  April 2 to 5, 2002 that Israel tried to take over the camp were they resided that was booby-trapped. On April 9 the Israelis requested a ceasefire to evacuate eight wounded soldiers and 13 corpses, this after 60 Palestinians died, an unknown number injured and a massive destruction of property which had left some 5,000 Palestinians homeless. Israel had produced some 215 airstrikes, as well as numerous Apache helicopter incursions.  On the Israeli side 23 soldiers were killed and over 100 injured in Jenin.
This film is banned in Israel,it is part of Sharon & Company's propaganda to keep Israelis as ignorant as possible on their ""politicide"". We hear more struggling voices here. The film is mostly interviews with Palestinians, children,mothers, and fathers who had seen their children die before them, or a father running unable to help his child who fell due to a explosion.

1889087,5,B00009RGCE,"This movie was initially banned when released in Israel, due to allegations that it was a vehicle of propaganda and included lies. Within the last year the Israeli court decision to ban the movie was over turned. In the documentary, director Mohamed Bakri interviews people from Jenin whose houses were demolished, who witnessed the many deaths and destruction of property that resulted from the violent Israeli incursion into the West Bank town of Jenin in 2002.

Israeli and International Human Rights groups, as well as many foreign countries denounced the incursion, since collective punishment (such as Israel's routine demolishing houses of suspected criminals; which leaves many families rather than only an alleged criminal homeless) is illegal. There were also stories of an incredible amount or casualites.

Israel refused to allow the UN-appointed commission of inquiry or any medical teams to investigate the area during and immediately following the attack (denial of medical teams to treat the injured also violates international law). People who were present described the scene as the equivalnet of genocide and the term massacre was used frequently by reporters who finally found a way to enter Jenin. Photoraphers who were seen attempting to take photos of the destrcution were shot at by Israeli Defense Forces. I remember seeing the horrifying images in papers because I was in Europe at the time, where coverage of the Middle Eat is more objective, and they gave nightmares. By comparison, the US media paid little attention.

The Israelis who opposed this film, and not all do, claim that one the people interviewed did not really sustain his injuries from the Israeli actions (the old man in the hospital). They also claimed that an insufficient number of people died in order for the act to be considered ""genocidal"" or ""a massacre.""

The movie lets the victims tell their version of the story, which the US media never covers. I doubt it, but I suppose there is a possibility that the onld man may be a person who embellished his tale for the documentary, just as there has been books written by Jews (and well received by book critics) about the horrors of the Holocaust, but who in fact actually lied when they said that they personally experienced them.

What is devastating to watch is the all the children who are casualties of the war, and to hear the hatred that is being caused by the violence. Here is a new generation displaced, and full of more anger than any before. How can practices that excite such hatred and hoplessness help improve prospects for peace?

The facts that remain undisputed: that many civilians died and much personal property was destroyed; the level of destruction; and that many children were made homeless, are scarred for life (and it is easy to see how they could feel hopeless about peace and become the new recruits for suicide bombing). When Israeli forces destroy Palestian homes, the Israeli state prevents most from rebuilding their houses, by denying them permits and demolishing any houses that are built without the permits. The documentary is not able to demonstrate fully the extent of the damage.

As an American, it is sickening to watch the docmumentary and realize that the US is paying for this destruction; it gives Israel more aid than any other country and most of the aid is received in the form of arms used to ruin the lives of Palestinians. It also made me wonder what the US troops are doing to the Iraqi civlians, since they recieved training from Israeli forces, and the US media is nortorious for only preenting the story that the US administration wants its people to hear in times of war.

Remember too, while watching this that Jenin is in the West Bank. Palestinians either live in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, and there is a great difference in living standards between the two. More documentaries (Gaza Strip, A Death in Gaza) have been made that demonstrate the institutionalized horrors of living under Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip, which the inhabitants and the IDF stationed there often refer to as ""hell."" In comparison, the West Bank has more arable land, much of the water that the Israeli population uses, and is much more desiraeble to Israeli settlers. Any destruction of Palestinian property in the West Bank seems like a covert tactic to encourage the people to flee as refugees, so that new illegal settlements can be built by the Israeli state and more Palestinian land can be be grabbed.",1106956800,45,4509,4.923684210526316

Palestinian producer: False film funded by PA
Documentary claims Israeli army committed war crimes
January 17, 2005

A Palestinian filmmaker who produced a documentary alleging Israeli troops committed war crimes in a refugee camp admitted in a deposition last week to falsifying scenes, using inaccurate information and obtaining financing for the project from the Palestinian Authority, WorldNetDaily has learned.

Muhammad Bakri, producer of ""Jenin, Jenin,"" a documentary that claims Israel committed genocide in the Jenin refugee camp in April 2002, admitted in a deposition to inaccuracies throughout his film. The filmmaker is being sued by five Israeli soldiers visible in still footage in the film, which alleges IDF troops killed a ""large number"" of civilians, mutilated Palestinian bodies, randomly executed and bombed women, children and the mentally and physically impaired, and leveled the entire refugee camp, including a wing of the local hospital.

The documentary doesn't show footage of the alleged atrocities, but in some scenes, faces of the soldiers now suing Bakri were superimposed over ""eyewitness testimony,"" and it was indicated they had committed ""war crimes.""

But Bakri, in a deposition obtained by WND, admitted he ""believed"" selected witnesses but didn't check the information they provided.

""I believed the things that I've been told. What I did not believe was not included in the film,"" said Bakri.

When asked about a scene in which it is implied Israeli troops ran over civilians, Bakri admitted to constructing the footage himself as an ""artistic choice."" He also answered ""no"" when asked if he believed ""that during the operation in Jenin, the Israeli soldiers killed people indiscriminately.""

In perhaps the most explosive element of the deposition, Bakri admitted his documentary, which was screened in theaters around the world, was financed in part by the Palestinian Authority. He said Yasser Abed Rabu, Palestinian minister of culture and information and a member of former PLO leader Yasser Arafat's executive committee, ""covered a part of the film expenses.""

Israel entered Jenin, which was considered a center for terrorist recruitment and operations, as part of its Operation Defensive Shield to crack down on increased suicide bombings by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. Israel sent infantry units to fight house-to-house and lost nearly two dozen soldiers to ambushes, Palestinian snipers and booby-trapped houses.

Claims of a massacre were immediately made following the operation by the Palestinian leadership, which spoke of upwards of 500 civilians killed and thousands wounded, but it was later determined 56 Palestinians, mostly gunmen, were killed, and 23 Israeli soldiers died in the battle.

Media accounts, documentary evidence and investigations by several international humanitarian organizations quickly proved there was no massacre....",1106092800,15,2929,5.619047619047619

1889090,1,B00009RGCE,"Five Israeli Defense Force soldiers pictured in this film are suing Palestinian filmmaker Mohammed Bakri for allegedly falsifying information about them. The film charges Israel with genocide in a refugee camp, despite proof that nothing of the sort actually happened. French director Pierre Rehov last year created a film, ""The Road to Jenin"" (available online) that blasts these charges to bits.

In a January 2005 deposition, Bakri admitted to falsifying scenes, using inaccurate information and obtaining financing for the project from the Palestinian Authority.

The film implies that five IDF soldiers (seen in the film's still footage) in April 2002 killed a ""large number"" of civilians, mutilated Palestinian bodies, randomly executed and bombed women, children and the mentally and physically impaired, and leveled the entire refugee camp, including a wing of the local hospital.

But this ""documentary"" contains no footage of the alleged atrocities. Rather, it superimposes the still images over ""eyewitness testimony,"" thereby suggesting that they committed ""war crimes"" in Jenin.

[Update, Dec. 20, 2009: In July 2008, an Israeli court ruled that the film was indeed slanderous --- but threw out the IDF plaintiffs' suit against Bakri since the film had not personally singled them out.]

Palestinian sources likewise made false allegations of mass murder in April 2002 following the Jenin battle, when they claimed that IDF forces had killed upwards of 500 civilians and wounded thousands. However, the United Nations concluded in a thorough investigation that only 56 Palestinians, mostly gunmen, were killed --- while 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the battle by booby-trapped houses and suicide bombers, facts that physical evidence confirmed in investigations conducted by several international humanitarian organizations.

There was never a massacre in Jenin --- except the massacre of 23 IDF forces.

Israel entered Jenin, a terrorist recruitment and operations center, during Operation Defensive Shield to halt a 2001 and early 2002 wave of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigade suicide bombings. To spare civilian lives, Israeli infantry units fought house-to-house and lost nearly two dozen soldiers to ambushes.

Several ""witnesses"" in this film describe IDF ""brutality,"" claiming that Israel attacked and killed ""many, many"" Palestinians with tanks, planes and snipers. But Bakri, like so many others who've made similar false charges, doesn't list the number of Palestinians killed --- much less their names.

Rehov's film disproves Bakri's claims, and was cited in the Israeli soldiers' lawsuit. Bakri, for example, charges that Israel fired 11 missiles at a Jenin hospital, leveling the facility with patients inside and later refused to let emergency personnel access the area. Dr. Mustafa Abo Gali says, ""The whole of the west wing was destroyed. Fighter planes launched their missiles every three minutes."" Gali makes the same claim in Rehov's film; but the latter also filmed the ""damage,"" which consists of a small hole outside the building, where the entire west wing remains very much intact. Rehov also shows aerial images of the hospital from the last day of Israel's Jenin incursion; the hospital was fine then, too.

Moreover, IDF medical officer Dr. David Zangen tells Rehov (on film) how the soldiers treated wounded Palestinians, including Hamas ""fighters."" This testimony is validated by film shot--at the time--of an Israeli soldier issuing orders that Gali receive all necessary medical supplies.

The inconsistencies in this film's ""witness testimony"" are quite plain. One older interviewee claims that Israelis forced Palestinian prisoners to fully undress ""in front of their brothers, sisters and children, who were used as human shields."" But Bakri's accompanying images show a group of Palestinians, all of them wearing pants.

The film also alleges that the IDF shot unarmed Palestinian villager Ali Youssef in the hands and feet. Rehov interviewed Youssef for his documentary: Youssef was shot once in the hand--while standing in a housing complex with Hamas gunmen.

Moreover, Israeli medics treated Youssef, discovered a congenital heart problem, and transported him to Israel for treatment in an Afula hospital. Hospital papers confirm Rehov's findings that Youseff was not shot in the leg at all.

The film also contains deceptive techniques to create false impressions of a massacre. In one scene, a tank heads toward a crowd. The image then blacks out, suggesting the people were all killed, according to Dr. Zangren, who adds that Bakri was not in Jenin at any time during the battle. Yet he deceptively juxtaposes images of Israeli tanks and snipers next to shots of Palestinian children.

The five soldiers suing Bakri in Tel Aviv sought more than $500,000 in damages. It alleged that Bakri's false claims had endangered the soldiers' lives: As Israeli reservists, they remained in constant professional contact with Arabs, some of whom could recognize and attack them as a direct result.

1889091,1,B00009RGCE,"Should an army intentionally incur more casualties in order to minimize civilian deaths in an enemy city? It's not always an easy decision. Still, in Jenin, the doves in Israel won out, and the battle was handled in a truly heroic and humane fashion. That made no difference to many antizionists, who automatically told the usual lies, such as the ones on this DVD. But it made a big difference to the Israelis, the vast majority of whom are very proud of Israeli behavior in Jenin and see the lies about Jenin as far worse than those about many other battles.

The battle for Jenin was a test for antizionists. And many of them flunked it. This movie is a good example of that.  But it is not the only example.  British newspapers such as the Guardian, the Evening Standard, the Independent, and the Times also flunked. And the usually very varied Israeli press was close to unanimous in condemning the lies in these newspapers.

According to Dr. David Zangen, who was actually in Jenin during the fighting (Bakri, who made the film, was not there until two weeks later), there are several major lies in this movie. Here are three examples of them:

1) The film says that a wing of the Jenin hospital was destroyed and that the Israeli Defence Forces purposely disrupted the supply of water and electricity to the hospital. In fact, the IDF troops were careful not to enter the hospital, even though they were aware that it was being used to shelter wanted people. The IDF maintained the supply of water, electricity and oxygen to the hospital throughout the fighting. And no part of the hospital was shelled or bombed.

2) There was a very strange claim about a fatally wounded baby who died after soldiers prevented his evacuation to a hospital. But no body of a baby was found, nor was the name of this baby ever revealed. The person making this claim also told of tanks crushing people alive: this simply did not happen.

3) Bakri's film mentions mass graves in which the Israeli soldiers put dead Arabs. However, there is agreement that only 52 Arabs died in the battle.

This DVD is indeed anti-Israeli. But it is not really pro-anything. It is propaganda that simply serves to make the world more violent, hate-filled, and murderous.",1106092800,10,2241,4.67005076142132

In response to the reviewer who says ""Every international organization that investigated the matter concur that there were 52 Palestinian dead in Jenin"". We will never know the true number of deaths because human rights organizations like Amnesty International were not allowed in. The IDF tightly controlled access to Jenin afterwards. Why? Also, 22 of the 52 admitted dead were civilians. The ""battle"" also left over 4,000 people homeless. All terrorists I'm sure.

1889093,1,B00009RGCE,"I watched Muhammad Bakri's film Jenin, Jenin in a limited forum, with

Jerusalem Cinematheque Director Leah Van Leer and several journalists.

After the private screening, I responded and indicated each lie and lack of

credibility. One of those present at the screening was outraged: ""If you

don't accept the facts in the film, you apparently don't understand

anything; how can you be a doctor?""

For a moment, I forgot that I had been in Jenin last April, serving as a

regional brigade doctor, while this viewer had, at best, been fed on rumors.

Bakri expertly weaves together lies and half-truths until it becomes very

difficult not to be seduced by the distorted picture he creates.

I did not succeed in convincing the Cinematheque management to cancel the

screening. I was told that the pictures of destroyed homes were authentic

and that there was, therefore, truth in the film, and that the film would be

shown around the world in any case. Even so, I was invited to its premiere

screening in Jerusalem and I arrived in order to explain my position to the

audience. Following are several points that I wished to raise to the

audience:

1. Dr. Abu Riali, director of the hospital in Jenin, claims in the film that

the western wing of the hospital was shelled and destroyed and that the IDF

knowingly hit the hospital's water and power supplies. There never was any

such wing and in any case, no part of the hospital was either shelled or

blown up. IDF soldiers took care not to enter its grounds even though we

knew that it was serving as a refuge for several wanted fugitives. We

guarded the water, electricity and oxygen supplies to the hospital all

throughout the fighting and assisted in setting up an emergency generator

after the city's electrical system was damaged. Bakri himself is seen in

the film wandering the hospital's clean and well-kept corridors, but not in

the blown up wing. I met him outside the theater and asked him if he had

visited the western wing. At first he said no, then he corrected himself

and said, ""You remember one moment in the film with shattered glass - it was

from there."" It is important to point out that this Abu Riali is one of the

""authorized sources"" for the claim of a ""massacre."" At the beginning of the

operation, he was interviewed on Al-Jazeera television and spoke of,

""thousands of victims.""

2. Another impressive part of the film is the interview with a male

75-year-old Jenin resident who mumbles and cries and tells how he was taken

out of his bed in the middle of the night, shot in the hand, and after he

failed to obey the soldiers' command to get up, was shot again in the foot.

I met this very same old man as he was brought to me after an operation to

clear one of the Hamas cells' houses in the refugee camp. He had indeed

been lightly injured in the hand and was suffering from a minor scratch on

the foot, but certainly not as the result of a bullet. IDF soldiers

transferred him to a secure station that had been set up to treat wounded

and there he was treated by me, among others. One of the military doctors

identified diagnosed a heart problem. We suggested that he be transferred

immediately to Haemek Hospital in Afula for treatment. He asked to be

treated at the hospital in Jenin since he did not speak Hebrew. After the

hospital refused to admit him, we transferred him to Afula and he stayed

there for three days in the internal medicine department for treatment of

his heart problems and the anemia that he suffered from as a result of

another chronic illness.

3. Another person who was interviewed spoke about a baby who suffered a

chest wound from a bullet that entered through his chest and exited his

body, creating a hole in his back. According to the film the baby died

after IDF soldiers prevented his evacuation to hospital. A baby's body with

this type of injury has never been found. Moreover, such an injury would

have been fatal, and evacuation would not have saved his life. What is this

baby's name? Where did his body disappear to?

4. The same person interviewed also told how, using his finger, he opened

the baby's airway in his neck after he was injured.

Again, a complete lie. Such an action cannot be carried out with a finger.

This ""witness"" adds that tanks ran over living people many times until they

were completely crushed - this never happened and is imaginary.

5. The film mentions a mass gravesite that IDF soldiers dug for Palestinian

dead. Every international organization that investigated the matter concur

that there were 52 Palestinian dead in Jenin, and that all the bodies were

returned to the Palestinians for burial. Bakri does not bother to show the

supposed location of this mass gravesite.

6. Israeli planes that supposedly bombed the city are mentioned in the film.

There were no such planes. In order to prevent civilian casualties, only

focused helicopter fire was used.

7. It is interesting to note that Bakri was not present in Jenin at the time

of the operation, and only arrived two weeks after it was completed. In

pictures shot at the site in the center of Jenin, the damage appears much

larger than it was in actual fact, and the martyrs' pictures and jihad

slogans - which had been present at the time of the IDF military operation -

had disappeared from the walls of houses. The film systematically and

repeatedly uses manipulative pictures of tanks taken in other locations,

artificially placing them next to pictures of Palestinian children.

In general, this is a vulgar, but extremely well done, work of manipulation.

At the conclusion of the film, hundreds of viewers gave Bakri and the film's

editor a standing ovation. Bakri asked the audience if there were any

questions. I presented myself, I went up to the stage and began to

systematically list the lies and inaccuracies in the film.

At first there were whispers in the audience, and later scornful calls, and

I was labeled a ""murderer,"" ""war criminal"" etc. I had barely succeeded in

finishing my second point when a man in the audience aggressively came up on

stage and tried to take the microphone out of my hand. I decided not to be

dragged into violence. I allowed him to take the microphone and left the

stage. I was surprised that only a few people stood up for my right to free

speech and free expression. I was shocked that the audience was unwilling

to hear the facts from someone who had physically been there.

It was difficult for me as a person, as a father and a doctor to hear calls

of ""murderer"" from my people. I said that I did not kill anyone. But the

calls became more heated, immense hatred was directed towards me. It left

me with a hard feeling that has not subsided. I am not sorry that I went to

the Cinematheque that evening. I am certain that in any case there were

people who heard my doubts, and that this changed a small amount of their

feelings towards the ""facts"" they saw. I am sure there were other people

who were shocked at the intolerance demonstrated by the audience, but even

so, it is hard for me [to accept] that they were the silent minority.

Allow me to say what I was unable to say to those people that evening. I am

proud that I was part of this excellent and ethical force that operated in

Jenin, regular army soldiers and reservists with motivation and a fighting

spirit, who went to destroy the terrorist infrastructure in its capital.

Many suicide-bombers came from Jenin, and were responsible for the murder of

the elderly, women and children on our streets. I am proud that we were

there, that we fought, and I also am proud of the morality of the battle.

The camp was not bombed from the air in order to prevent innocent civilian

casualties, and artillery was not used even though we knew about specific

areas in the [refugee] camp where terrorists were holing up. IDF soldiers

fought against terrorists, and terrorists only. Before destroying a

building where terrorist fire against our soldiers had originated from, as

many warnings as could be allowed, were given, so that the people could

leave without injury. The medical team administered medical aid to all

casualties, even if they had Hamas tattoos on their hands. At no point was

any person refused medical treatment.

This battle, heroic on one hand and ethical on the other, took a heavy toll

from the best of our fighters! We who had to be there - the soldiers that

fell there, their families and the IDF - do not deserve that Muhammad Bakri

should incite the world to murder and hatred at our expense.

1889094,1,B00009RGCE,"Should an army intentionally incur more casualties in order to minimize civilian deaths in an enemy city?  It's not always an easy decision.  Still, in Jenin, the doves in Israel won out, and the battle was handled in a truly heroic and humane fashion. That made no difference to many antizionists, who automatically told the usual lies, such as the ones in this movie. But it made a big difference to the Israelis, the vast majority of whom are very proud of Israeli behavior in Jenin and see the lies about Jenin as far worse than those about many other battles.

The battle for Jenin was a test for antizionists. And many of them flunked it. This movie is a good example of that.  But it is not the only example.  British newspapers such as the Guardian, the Evening Standard, the Independent, and the Times also flunked.  And the usually very varied Israeli press was close to unanimous in condemning the lies in these newspapers.

According to Dr. David Zangen, who was actually in Jenin during the fighting (Bakri, who made the film, was not there until two weeks later), there are several major lies in this movie.  Here are three examples of them:

1)  The film says that a wing of the Jenin hospital was destroyed and that the Israeli Defence Forces purposely disrupted the supply of water and electricity to the hospital.  In fact, the IDF troops were careful not to enter the hospital, even though they were aware that it was being used to shelter wanted people.  The IDF maintained the supply of water, electricity and oxygen to the hospital throughout the fighting.  And no part of the hospital was shelled or bombed.

2)  There was a very strange claim about a fatally wounded baby who died after soldiers prevented his evacuation to a hospital.  But no body of a baby was found, nor was the name of this baby ever revealed.  The person making this claim also told of tanks crushing people alive: this simply did not happen.

3)  Bakri's film mentions mass graves in which the Israeli soldiers put dead Arabs.  However, there is agreement that only 52 Arabs died in the battle.

This film is indeed anti-Israeli.  But it is not really pro-anything.  It is propaganda that simply serves to make the world more violent, hate-filled, and murderous.",1105056000,12,2259,4.677664974619289
1889104,1,B00009RGCE,"Jenin was a terrorist base used to launch suicide attacks against Israel that killed Jews, Christians and Israeli Arabs.  Every piece of supportable evidence debunks any massacre claim.  Even the UN, which is openly politically biased against Israel, stated that there was no massacre and also stated that Jenin was a terrorist base camp.  The Arab world has many legitimate issues with the west.  But continuing to propogate total falsehoods will not solve any of the problems and will not help the Palestinian civilians who are caught in the middle.  Israel will make peace with a real partner as they did with Egypt and Jordan.  No peace can be made with terrorism and terrorists.",1105056000,24,683,4.947368421052632
1889105,1,B00009RGCE,"Jenin, Jenin, like its sister movie Gaza Strip is an emotional film, but it is worthless propaganda.  Just as the people of Gaza were whiners, so too are the people of Jenin.

The people of Jenin blame everyone; from the great Satan, to Israel, to the heretics of the US.  But they NEVER take responsibility for themselves.

Once the people of Jenin stop whining and take responsibility and accountability for themselves, they will get out of their rut.  Until then, the endless cycle they weep about is of their own doing.

People of Jenin, stop whining and grow up.",1102291200,17,567,4.6767676767676765
1889106,1,B00009RGCE,"""Jenin Jenin"" did not set up the background as to why Israel had gone to the camp. In April, 2002 a suicide bomber who lived in Jenin blew himself up in a Netanya hotel where Israelis were celebrating Passover. He killed 29 innocent people. Prior to this bombing, the IDF had withdrawn from the West Bank because of a tentative ceasefire.

The part of the movie with the old man who claims he was shot in his hand and his foot was staged. This 75 year old man was originally treated by Israelis, not Palestinians and his wounds were not bullet wounds and had nothing to do with IDF operations in Jenin. He wasn't even in the hospital for his wounds, he was in the hospital for heart problems and anemia.

There are also many claims in the movie that the IDF used F-16's and destroyed much of the city. The IDF had no F-16's or jetfighters deployed. They used precision helicopter fire, no bombs, and also used hand-to-hand ground combat.

Aerial photographs taken by Israel, and authenticated by the international community, show the destroyed buildings occupied an area a bit larger than a football field. This is very different that what the movie shows and claims.

Dr. Abu Rali who was interviewed throughout the movie, claims that the west-wing of the hospital was destroyed by Israeli forces. The hospital in Jenin has no west-wing and never did. No part of the hospital was damaged by Israeli fire. This is why no footage was shown in the movie of the destroyed wing. It was a lie. When Bakri was asked by an Israeli reporter if he visited the destroyed wing he said ""No"" he then later changed his story and said that when in the film, he showed a falling piece of glass, this was in the destroyed wing.

Dr. Rali also claimed that Israel cut off water and electricity to the hospital when, in fact, Israel brought them water and a generator to ensure the hospital received continuous electricity.

Dr. Rali, though not shown in the movie, also rejected blood brought in from Israeli aid groups. He refused to use Israeli blood. To solve this problem, the Israeli groups organized blood delivery from Jordan.

One person claims that Israeli tanks ran over Palestinians that were tied down. When the footage rolled it cut off just before the tank ran them over. There was no proof that the tanks actually ran people over found by anyone anywhere.

Another claim is that a baby was struck in the chest by a bullet from an Israeli rifle. They do not say the baby's name, no international aid group or organization has found evidence that this happened even though multiple groups interviewed extensively throughout Jenin.

Muhammad Bakri, the director, is a member of the Bakri family that resides in Beina, Israel. Two relatives of Muhammed Bakri, Ibrahim and Yassin Bakri, were arrested for aiding a suicide bomber that killed 9 Israelis at Rimon Crossroads.

Human Rights Watch, after spending 2 weeks in Jenin after the military operation, doing extensive surveying, interviewing, and research, did not find evidence of systematic summary executions as claimed by some in the movie.

Tents- There was no sign of life in the tents. The man and his baby went into the tent as if they were just moving into it but the movie was shot weeks after the operation in Jenin. Everybody would have been there already.

The Operation

Jenin's history- Since the Intifada started in 2000 more than 20 suicide bombers have come from Jenin.

Palestinian casualties and massacre claim- There was no massacre and this was confirmed by the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, the European Union, and the United Sates. The Palestinian Authority has backed down from the claim that over 500 were killed. They now say that about 56 were killed, 34 were armed militants. Israel claims that between 50 and 60 were killed and 43 were armed militants. Israel admits there are more dead than the Palestinian Authority does. So how are they trying to hide something.

Israeli casualties- During the Jenin operation, Israel lost 23 of its soldiers which proves that there was an intense firefight. If militants can kill 23 trained soldiers there must have been a lot of them coming from all directions. This may explain why there was some loss of innocent life.

""Innocents""- There was a loss of innocent life. For the intensity of the fighting this number was kept extremely low. Had there been more loss of innocent life, the Palestinians would have blamed the Israelis even though children were believed to have been fighting.

""Believe me, there are children stationed in the houses with explosive belts at their sides.""

-Abu Jandal, Islamic Jihad

Destroyed Buildings- Many of the building were booby trapped and destroyed by the Palestinians' own bombs. Estimates are that over 50 buildings were booby trapped.

 ""We had more than 50 houses booby-trapped around the camp. We chose old and empty buildings and the houses of men who were wanted by Israel because we knew the soldiers would search for them.""

1889107,5,B00009RGCE,"Calling this video a deceptive tool of propaganda is the same as saying the Holocaust never existed. Most educated individuals do not doubt the horrors committed by the Nazi regime, just as most educated individuals are aware of the horrors inflicted on the Palestinians at the hands of indicted war criminals like me, Ariel Sharon.",1100217600,12,332,5.054545454545455
1889108,4,B00009RGCE,"Palestinian filmmaker and actor Mohamed Bakri, traveled to the refugee camp of Jenin to document the devastation there. The camp was home to 1000s of refugees before it was ploughed over by Israeli tanks. One comment compares the devastation to resembling an earthquake, and after seeing the film, I would agree with that. However, as the film points out, if this sort of devastation occurred anywhere else, the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations would swoop in and start digging out the bodies--this does not happen--and the incident is largely ignored by the world.

The film footage is quite frankly devastating--piles of rubble everywhere you look, buildings covered in graffiti, and families trying to live in shelled out homes. Of course, there are also hundreds of little tents erected for the refugees.

Interviews include local doctors who express frustration at the bombing of their hospital and efforts to recover the dead. Other interviewees include various Palestinians who were shot as they emerged from their homes. By far the most chilling interviews were conducted with a little girl--I'd approximate her age to be about 12. She was obviously an intelligent, articulate child, but instead of the normal 12-year-old concerns, she is focused on rebuilding and never giving up her homeland, and she even relishes the thought of what she'd do to Sharon if he dared show his face in the camp. Such intense nationalism in one so young should give pause for thought. And if that's not enough, there's one scene with small children marching through the streets of Jenin chanting, ""Jerusalem is ours."" Violence begets violence, and ultimately, the children of Jenin are victims of this endless cycle of violence and hate.

Some viewers feel this film is propaganda and others see the film as a desperate cry for recognition of an atrocity. ""Jenin Jenin"" has value to the viewer who wishes to learn and experience more on the tragic subject of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I doubt I shall ever forget the Palestinian father who expressed pride that his children are not growing up in fear, and I shall most certainly never forget the ferocity of the little girl who loves her homeland. She reminded me so much of Leila Khaled (author of ""My People Shall Live."")

The film left me with many questions--for example, I wish some background had been given concerning the Jenin incident (the Israelis were there after Palestinian fighters). Most documentaries tend to take a hands-off approach these days and hold commentary to a minimum. ""Jenin Jenin"" follows this standard and suffers as a consequence. The film is mostly interviews with local Palestinians mixed with some footage. At the beginning of the film, the hand-held camera was a bit too jerky for my tastes, and there were instances when I wished the subtitles had remained on the screen for a few moments longer.

Extra features include bios of the filmmaker and the producer (he was shot shortly after making the film). And there is also a photographic 'slideshow' with an accompanying letter read by the physician who founded KinderUSA, a charitable organization devoted to the children of Palestine--displacedhuman",1098230400,39,3199,5.120689655172414
1889109,1,B00009RGCE,"Okay folks, it's really simple.  This film was produced and financed through the Palestinian Authority. It is propaganda, not fact.

This film does not acknowledge that the U.N. and humanitarian groups certified that there was no massacre: 30 armed terrorists, 22 civilians and 35 Israeli soldiers were killed -- NOT 3,000 civilians, as the Palestinian Authority claims.  This film also won't bother to tell you that the Israeli military operation, Defensive Shield, came on the heels of nearly daily suicide attacks within Israel's internationally accepted borders, which murdered over 130 civilians in April 2002 alone, including those who perished in the Passover Massacre at the Park Hotel in Netanya.

We regularly support aerial bombing of enemy targets in Afghanistan, even in Iraq, yet we fail to support Israel's care in refusing to use this tactic and instead commiting ground troops to the more risky (for Israeli soldiers) urban warfare approach, in a bid to prevent civilian deaths.

No one reviewing this film, or the film itself, acknowledges that the presence of armed groups and their weapons caches and factories WITHIN civilian areas is a war crime and that the Geneva Conventions themselves acknowledge this fact and remove protections against civilian areas which harbor military and paramilitary targets.  They certainly won't mention the many 'staged' funerals which were put on for the international media (there was some famous footage where a dead body fell off it's stretcher, then stood up and climbed back on the stretcher so that the 'funeral' could progress).

If you're interested in the truth, and prefer to not be  brainwashed, I would recommend Canadian journalist Martin Himmel's ""Jenin: Massacring the Truth"", which utilizes home video footage from Israeli reservists and Palestinian terrorists, who filmed the conflict, as well as frank interviews with the terrorists themselves.  Unforunately, Amazon does not yet offer this documentary, but it is available elsewhere online (do a websearch).",1098057600,19,2031,5.4222222222222225
1889110,5,B00009RGCE,"Like the Checkpoint, this documentary offers a masterful account of the unfathomable suffering of the Palestinian people. It presents compelling evidence of the countless human rights violations perpetrated by the Israeli army in Jenin. In addition to providing revealing footage from Jenin, this documentary contains numerous witness testimonies. There is no doubt that what happened in Jenin constitutes a serious violation of international law. Unfortunately, as has always been the case in the past, whenever Israel comes under severe criticism some people go at great lengths to deny what happened. To these people, proof makes no difference, to them Israel is never guilty. Apologists for the Israeli regime strongly believe that Israelis are infallible and omnipotent. That Israeli soldiers target young children and impose curfews is unimportant to these individuals. That old people, women and young children are constantly subjected to degradation and harassment at the so called checkpoints makes no difference either. In the documentary Checkpoint, the Israeli soldiers refer to the Palestinians as the cattle, not as decent human beings worthy of respect. Furthermore, they harass the Palestinian females and use derogatory remarks when these girls cross the checkpoints. Imagine what it must feel like being stopped on your way to work and on your way home. Contrary to what some people think, the Palestinians are not free. Given that their movement is severely restrained and given all these curfews that are being imposed on them, are they really free? Israelis feel omnipotent having the U.S. government on their side. Given that Israel is militarily superior to the Palestinians, how can this be a fair and balanced conflict? The Palestinians are throwing stones while the Israelis are utilizing sophisticated weaponry with which they target young boys throwing stones at them! Talk about gross injustice. I strongly recommend this documentary. It is a tragic story of powerless people facing a much more powerful adversary. It is a tragic story of the people devoid of hope and of the people in great despair. It is an unfathomable tragedy taking place before the eyes of the entire international community. It leaves one wondering, does anyone in this world care about human suffering and justice?",1096848000,23,2318,5.3884297520661155

1889112,1,B00009RGCE,"I wrote this review years ago on May 17, 2004, and now May 19, 2009 make this addition and update to my review. Many people here and elsewhere have commented about the lawsuit against the producer of this film.
As has been reported elsewhere the producer Mr. Muhammad Bakri,  who had claimed Israel committed genocide in the Jenin refugee camp in April 2002,  has  ADMITTED in a deposition to inaccuracies throughout his film. The film maker was sued by five Israeli soldiers visible in still footage in the film.
The deposition reportedly  shows that:
 ""When asked about a scene in which it is implied Israeli troops ran over civilians, Bakri admitted to constructing the footage himself as an ""artistic choice."" He also answered ""no"" when asked if he believed ""that during the operation in Jenin, the Israeli soldiers killed people indiscriminately.""  Bakri additionally admitted his documentary, which was screened in theaters around the world, was financed in part by the Palestinian Authority. The producer Mohammad Bakri stated that  Yasser Abed Rabu, Palestinian minister of culture and information and a member of former PLO leader Yasser Arafat's executive committee, ""covered a part of the film expenses.""'

  So we now have the film producer, admitting under OATH, that the film is NOT accurate, that he did not verify the accounts of persons interviewed AND in fact had staged and fabricated parts of the film.  I wonder in light of these admissions by Mr. Muhammad Bakri , the film producer,  if any of the reviewers here would change their view of this fictional film.

TO show the contrast between the laws and government of Israel and that of the rest of the Middle East, the law suit by the IDF soldiers was eventually dismissed.  While the Israeli Court did determine that the film was inaccurate and was slanderous, it also apparently determined that the film was not directed against the particular five soldiers who commenced the law suit.  Therefore those five particular IDF soldiers could not prove that they in particular were slandered and the lawsuit was dismissed.  In other words the Court determined that the slander in the film was directed against the whole population of Israel or the entire IDF,  and not at the five specific soldiers. Therefore those five particular soldiers cannot bring the lawsuit against the Producer Muhammad Bakri.  The five soldiers did receive as part of a cash settlement money damages against the movie theaters that had shown the film at that time

This was purported to be a ""documentary"" not a fictional work. This film was not just for entertainment but to educate as to what occurred.  That is why I have stated below, in my original review that if this is to be treated as a film of fiction, of the imagination, then that is fine. But as a documentary it is simply a fraud.  A film by Pierre Rehov, The Road to Jenin,  challenges Bakri's allegations and may be a better choice as a documentary
It is a terrible thing to create a film of fantasy and pretend it is a documentary.  In injures the truth which is always under a  continuous shadow and darkens the  hope to seek a resolution in the Middle East.  Kenneth Ellman, ke@kennethellman.com

Original Review of May 17, 2004
I have read the various reviews and comments about this film.
IF this film was distributed as a work of Fiction having no connection with reality then I would not rate it at all. A work of fiction is not held to any standard of factual reliability so and it would have no connection with the real world.  Each person chooses his or her own fantasy to enjoy.

Apparently this film pretends to make a record of what actually occurred.  The incidents alleged to be addressed by this film have been carefully investigated by various International Organizations including the United Nations (no friend of Israel) and also  by the United States, and Israel itself. Various other governments were seriously concerned with the allegations.  These Official investigations and records are  available and fully document what occurred. The Official investigations show beyond any question that Israel did not destroy the Town of Jenin and  did not intentionally kill the civilians  who might have been in the area of the battle. Israel did not cause the death of the people as alleged in the film and as alleged at other times by various propaganda.

SO the question is: what do the comments here about the film reveal. It reveals that many people are easily deceived and apparently not willing to actually read the investigations conducted over the allegations.  IF you are not interested enough to find out the truth by reviewing the voluminous records and studies conducted by reputable and reliable organizations then why pretend that you care?

Someone who cares wants to learn the truth and not just watch a film or tv program. Reading takes a little work but it is a great reward. Are the viewers  of this film just commenting on this Amazon site about how they liked this work of FICTION? This imaginary film?
OR do they actually believe that these things happened as the film pretends and fantasizes?

SO it is very, very, sad when people who apparently care so much about an allegation are not willing to make the effort to read the studies and reports about the incident but accept a film of fantasy as being reality. If this type of  NON fact checking and intellectual dishonesty continues to pervade our American  culture then we will be further distanced from reality and our judgments will become weak and ineffective. Nothing is more important than Truth and making the effort to find the Truth. One of the reasons why Peace is so hard to achieve in that area of the world is the way of life that the Truth is secondary to social feelings and needs. Peace cannot be achieved by falsehood. This film is just another stab at the Arab and Israeli people in that region by continuing to portray fantasy as reality. It is an insult to all viewers.

What is unforgiveable is that, (thanks to Washington's complicity and support)Israel continues to get away with daily murder and human rights abuses galore condemned by millions of civilized people everywhere, numerous international organizations and scores of principled Israelis and Jews.

Jenin Jenin is about what happened to the Palestinians living in the refugee camp.  It is an excellent film, and for his efforts, Bakri earned two international film awards.

The fact that some Israeli soldiers are now suing Bakri is nothing to frighten you away from this film.  The Israeli military, despite its defenders in the U.S., was condemned by numerous human rights organizations for its actions during the invasion.  I personally know many Palestinians who could attest to numerous human rights violations, and I have encountered that army many many times over the years in living in the West Bank.  In the past, the army was not like it is today, mainly because the settler movement is now inside the army.  In the past, settlers would get exemptions for purposes of religious study.  When Oslo was signed, they started to worry about Israel giving up settlements and started going in and staying in the army.  This change in the composition of the armed forces helps account for the kind of brutality in the film as well as documented by many many Palestinians during that month.

I have showed this film to many, including students, who found it an excellent resource on what occured in the camp.  What is fascinating about Jenin, Jenin is Israel's banning the film in Israel rather than engaging it.
