7980433,3,B00008973L,"Walking on Water was critically acclaimed upon its release in 2002 in Australia.  It focusses on a range of individuals who are all linked to a friend who has died of AIDS, assisted by euthanasia.  However, the euthanasia does not work, so one of the friends (Charlie) helps the process by placing a plastic bag over his head.  This, of course fuels much friction with the remaining friend's, even with Charlie himself who now has to live with the guilt of what he has done.

Walking on Water has moments of brilliance, but overall it is not the masterpiece I had been told it was.  I found it difficult to care for any of the characters, and at the end of the day, that was the director's intention (I think).",1137888000,3,710,4.430769230769231

Were that all movies had the emotional and spiritual impact of this fine film written by Roger Monk and directed newcomer Tony Ayres.

The setting is Sydney, Australia and the mood is established by cinematographer Robert Humphreys' panoramas of the ocean and inlets and coastlines surrounding this city.  Gavin (David Bonney) is dying with AIDS and has been attended in his home by his friend and business partner Anna (Maria Theodorakis) and caregiver Charlie (Vince Colosimo) and Charlie's lover Frank (Nicholas Bishop).  It is Gavin's wish to die with dignity and when the time comes for the assisted suicide, the designated doctor Dr Simms (Timothy Jones) administers IV morphine while Gavin is surrounded by his extended family as well as his brother Simon (Nathaniel Dean) and wife Kate (Anna Lisa Phillips) and his mother (Judi Farr).  The euthanasia does not seem to be working and in desperation Charlie places a plastic bag over Gavin's head to hasten the requested death - a deed that will haunt Charlie and the rest at the bedside.

Anna remains apparently calm in the immediate aftermath, tending to the 'funeral' arrangements according to Gavin's requests.  Gavin's mother appears to want to make up for years of distance by interceding in the plans and the will, but Anna is strong and the service goes as planned.  After the funeral the mother and Simon's wife leave to return to their home away form Sydney, leaving Simon to remain until Gavin's ashes are ready for transport.  In this 'home' things begin to disintegrate: Charlie attempts to evade his guilt about his final assistance by anesthetizing himself with morphine elixir, cocaine, alcohol and barhopping.  His behavior further distances his lover Frank and the latter ends the relationship.  Anna finds emotional outlet in placing demands on Charlie and eventually sublimates her loss by escaping into physical encounters with Simon, taking him to bed and to bars and to drugs all of which eventually awaken Simon to his infidelity to Kate and results in his leaving the 'home'.

The climax of the film is the confrontation of those who were closest to Gavin - Anna and Charlie - who in despair vent their rage so intimately associated with the death of a loved one  and search for a path of recovery.  It is this means of healing that comprises the ending of this richly tender film.

Actors Vince Colosimo and Maria Theodorakis are  exceptionally fine in their roles and the supporting cast is homogeneously fine.  Judi Farr gives one of those cameos that breathes 'best supporting actress'!  The concept of how extended families intertwine with genetic families in times of stress is as well shown in this film as any in memory.  One criticism: much of the excellent script is lost to poor sound editing, to the good but overly loud music, and most important to the lack of English subtitles for those of us who are not intimately familiar with the varying Australian accents!  Watch this film twice and with trained ears you'll appreciate it even more. Grady Harp, May 05",1115424000,3,3281,4.930909090909091

Another great Australian movie to prove that we have the right stuff. This is a touching drama about a group of friends who come together over the death of one of them, Gavin, from AIDS. In the beginning of the movie, Gavin is still alive but quickly deteriorates. From there, we learn that his parting wishes left for his friends who have been by his side for 18 months is to end his suffering when it gets this bad. The matter is complicated when Gavin's mother turns up at his side and proves to know nothing of her son's wishes. A doctor is brought in and a lethal dose injected, but in a heart-wrenching scene, he fails to die, after many attempts in the end it is Charlie (Colosimo) who ends it by suffocating him. After this gruesome end, all the friends and family are disturbed and we are taken into their world for the following few days. Excellent acting all round by a stellar cast of relative unknowns ensure this movie is presented honestly. The characters of Charlie and Anna (Theodorakis), the two housemates are both hugely affected by the happenings and their lives are thrown into turmoil as are their mental states. Very moving film about real people.
