8088582,4,B000BLBZDO,"These UFC fight packs that put two payperview events in one set are a great value. UFC 47 pits Tito Ortiz against Chuck Liddell. This was a much anticipated fight and the event was electric. UFC 48 has Shamrock taking on Kimo. The best part of this dvd might be the co-main event, with Tim Sylvia and Frank Mir fighting for the UFC Heavyweight title.

Both of these dvds had some important outcomes that carried over to future events. As usual, each dvd comes with special behind the scenes footage of the fighters and the event. Good deal for a UFC fan if you haven't seen these fights yet.",1147219200,2,591,4.422018348623853
8088583,3,B000BLBZDO,"it was a good buy, but one of the bouts in 47 wouldn't play, on my computer, a dvd player, or a ps2.  frustrating, but I'm over it.",1142380800,,131,3.6785714285714284
