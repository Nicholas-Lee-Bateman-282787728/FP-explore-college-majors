I don't like it. Under Mystic, I really imagined something better.",1255219200,,132,4.541666666666667
8261846,3,B00168X0L6,"Firstly, do not confuse this Mystic India, A Musical Journey through India,
with the ultra elusive IMAX Mystic India (The Story of Neelkanth) as I did.
This is a collection of Indian Music - 25 music videos in all - being all the World Music videos released by Music Today 2002-2005, copyright Living Music India Ltd - nothing to do with Dancing Dolphins and IMAX.
Production values for the videos are high - mainly ghazal type songs with some semi-classical sarod etc.
RRP for the DVD is 295 rupees, about $US7.50, so the retail price does not impress. You'll get no information booklet to the tracks for your money either.",1225843200,11,624,4.681818181818182
