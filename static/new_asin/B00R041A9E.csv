6891203,5,B00R041A9E,"UPDATE: MAY 1st 2015: RECEIVED MY COPY.  A FEW THINGS:

Although it does not register on here, that I see, I bought this via Amazon, so it should be showing me as a ""verified buyer"" but for whatever reason it is not.  Oh well.  My copy got here on Tuesday, and I have to admit I was highly disappointed in the lack of special features.  It's basically three individual season blurays inside a case, so there's no special packaging or anything like that, in case anyone was thinking there was.  The packaging is fine and it looks nice on the shelf, although admittedly the paper that is used for the case feels a bit ""thin"" and ""cheap""..

The problem is the lack of special features.  There's almost nothing on here, which is disappointing considering they had to have a lot of stuff to work with.  They put out a webseries hosted by the actor who portrayed Axl's mortal best friend Zeb going into the history of the God's and whatnot.  Where's that?  There's no blooper reels, there's no behind the scenes featurettes, no puff pieces, no nothing, almost.

What there IS, is a few (read: 2) special features on Season 1.  There's a commentary on the pilot episode featuring Tim Balme (who plays Mike) and Emmett Skilton (who plays Axl) as well as the episode director Mark Beesley.  Also on Season 1's set is a ""Bonus Cast Interview"".

And that's it, that's all for special features for the entire series box set.

The only thing I can think of is that they have a bigger set coming out later with a ton of extras, but that isn't likely I wouldn't imagine.  For starters, here in the USA, they put this out before the 3rd season was even aired on the SyFy Network, which leads me to think the ratings weren't that great, so they won't be airing Season 3 here.

If they WERE going to release a SECOND TV series (which happens I think less often than individual movies, due to the cost in putting out a set with so many discs), it would more than likely be a New Zealand release, but I could be wrong.  Depending on how well this show does on Netflix, where it was recently added, you never know.

Bottom line, this is a fantastic show that if you really like the show, I would suggest you buy this.  Very good price and it's a very entertaining program.  If you're on the fence, I would just suggest checking it out on Netflix and decide for yourself later if you want to spring for a box set with almost no special features.  If all you want is the show, well you're in luck!

Original Review Below:

For the past three years I've been enthralled by a New Zealand television series called ""The Almighty Johnsons"".  As someone who lives in America, I enjoy finding shows from all over the globe that interest me.  I've been fortunate to discover a lot of really cool shows over the years from outside of the country, whether it's Canada's ""Durham County"", ""End Game"" and ""Little Mosque On The Prairie"", to Australia's awesome action series ""Rush"", or the UK's ""Hustle"" and ""Spooks"".

Often I have to find ways to see these outside the mainstream, as these shows don't tend to air here in the states, although a few have recently started showing here including the delightful Little Mosque, as well as this show itself, now having aired on the SyFy network here in the states.

The Almighty Johnsons, is a show about four brothers who are reincarnated Norse Gods, with the youngest brother, Axel, being Odin.  The basic premise is that Odin needs to find his wife ""Frigg"" (The Goddess of Marriage), and if he dies before finding her and performing the marriage ceremony, thus allowing all the Gods to ascend to Asgard and gain 100% of their powers, then all the Gods and all the humans will die.

For the last three seasons we've seen Axel get close, and there have been some red herrings thrown about as to who the Frigg would be revealed as.  I won't spoil that for those who are interested in catching the series.

There are certain shows that you watch and you get caught up in thanks to the great writing and acting in it.  Recently the best example of that is Breaking Bad.  It's kind of amazing to see the incredible reaction the show has gotten over the years, and how it's built to this crescendo as the finale episodes have aired.  It's truly like nothing I've seen before that I can recall.

Breaking Bad's success is owed to it's phenomenal writing and acting and how it really sucks you in and you are just enthralled by everything about it.  I feel that way about Almighty Johnsons, although the two are drastically different series in tone and style.

Where Breaking Bad is based (mostly) in reality, The Almighty Johnsons is more of a sci-fi fantasy type series dealing with Norse Gods being reincarnated.  Not exactly art imitating life.

That said, the show is brilliant all on it's own.  The cast is perfect pretty much all around.  Emmett Skilton who plays Axel Johnson (Odin) is fantastic in his role and his relationship with his mortal friend Zeb (Hayden Frost) is genuine and often times touching.  Despite the worlds difference between the two, they are still best buds no matter what.  It's been quite enjoyable watching the two interact and I think that is one of the things I'll miss the most,now that the show is done.

I think out of all the TV Series Finales I've seen, this one really nailed it more than any.  I mean every step of the way was crafted in a way that would wrap up the series if they in fact were cancelled after their third season, which they were.  There was confusion over whether or not there would be a Season 3, so I think if they had ended this on a big cliffhanger, that would have been a betrayal to the fans.

There is none of that, and what you have here is ...I know I keep saying it, but perfect.  That's the first word I thought of when I finished it.  It's perfection.  It balanced the right tone, it wrapped up important storylines, and it not only directed the storyline towards the end that was promised from the very 1st episode, but it also leaves it open for advancing for more seasons.

The show kind of hit all the buttons that I wanted.  It brought a satisfying conclusion to the Mike/Axel/Frigg storyline, while mending the feelings between the brothers.

I can't really reinforce that last bit enough so I'm saying it again.  This is a series that really properly nailed the ending wrapping up all storylines in the best possible ways.  How many shows have you gotten invested in and then found out they got cancelled and it left on a cliffhanger?

Or worse, they knew they were ending and wrote a horrible ending.

There's not many shows that I can think of that really stuck the landing on the series finale of a lengthy series of 3 seasons or more.  ""Lost"", which I thoroughly enjoyed and I liked the ending, turned a lot of people off with the ending to it.  ""Dexter"" just completely went sideways with it's bogus ending that they did (I was fine with it -- for the most part -- up until the final twist reveal), and I was kind of frustrated with the recent ""Burn Notice"" finale as well (which pulled a similar twist reveal at the end as ""Dexter"").

So on the heels of both the Dexter & Burn Notice finales, I was nervous about the finale of this, and whether or not it would follow in a long line of (hopefully not) Series finales.

Fortunately it was a perfect ending, if it is to be an ending.  The words I want to say and the words I can think of to say are drastically different, because there are so many things I wish I could articulate about how this finale made me feel, and yet I can't truly do so.

So just take this review for what it is: Final thoughts on a great show, IMO, by a fan.  And hopefully you all who read this will give it a shot and come to love it like I do.

I have been waiting a long time to get this on DVD, and so I was thrilled to see that a complete series set on Bluray at THAT has been scheduled for release!  These are, allegedly, the uncut versions from New Zealand (which has a good deal of cursing and some nudity as well that were no doubt excised from the SyFy Channel Airings)  When I get my copies I will update my review with the verification.",1422144000,32,8162,4.403204272363151

6891224,2,B00R041A9E,"SPOILER ALERT  There are spoilers in here for the first and second seasons of the Almighty Johnsons

Let me just start with the fact that I actually enjoyed watching this show, in a ""this is dumb, but I can't stop watching"" kind of way. With that being said, I also noticed that there were a TON of problems regards to its portrayal of women and minorities. In the second season specifically, Maori culture is inaccurately portrayed, belittled and implicitly made fun of. And while the casting was PC, the overall tone of their portrayal was honestly just plain painful to watch.
The first thing that bugged me right off was the music that they play in the background, as it is either reggae or some kind of sci-fi esque music that implies that they're aliens or something. This ties into their portrayal as not being very financially stable- they drive a crappy van, their meetings are held in a garage, and they ask for weed as repayment for a murder, so that they can sell it. They are constantly making fun of the characters and objectifying them. The Norse goddesses are constantly making objectifying remarks like Ive always had a thing for brown boys, they're quite naughty. They are also constantly making fun of Jeromes character as being ridiculous and misogynistic, and therefore takes validation away from any of his claims in the show. In this vien, these characters seem to just be there for some comic relief (although I think they failed hard on this one, because I definitely did not laugh). Theres an especially offensive and painfully awkward rapping scene that somehow is supposed to be representative of what actually happens at a hui, and their whole ceremony (hui) is totally made fun of.
The inaccuracy of their portrayal of Maori culture, and their lack of research is also incredibly apparent, when a simple google search gives you more accurate information than this show does (Im not going to pretend to be an expert on Maori culture, but from the research I did do, it seems like theres a lot of reinterpretation that the writers did, especially in regards to the prophecy that seems to mirror the Norse prophecy almost exactly). I understand that creative license is applicable to some extent, but whats really terrible to me is the amount of time tediously going into each Norse god and goddesses backgrounds and mythology, and totally butchering the Maoris. This ties into the portrayal of the Maori Gods as being underrepresented in the show (theres only 3 Maori gods, yet somehow there are like innumerable Norse gods and goddesses just wandering around NZ???? Please tell me how the hell this works). The Maori gods that are represented are also compared to the Norse gods as being not as powerful or important, and that they don't have as cool of powers as the Norse gods.
Finally, the biggest issue I saw right off the bat, was that this show completely embraces the neocolonial narrative that because you have lived in a place for a couple generations that means you're entitled to it, because its not the same as when your ancestors came in and took the land. This was really solidified for me when one of the Norse goddesses says (as a response to Jerome saying their gods have been there forever and always): youve just been here longer than us and that thousands of years is still not always.
This show, especially this season, ultimately supports the idea that the colonizing religion is the correct religion, because Gaia ultimately becomes a Norse goddess and so the Maori ones just kind of disappear and aren't important for the rest of the show.",1465430400,,3592,4.773311897106109

The lives of the Johnson family was always something we looked forward to from week to week. By the time we started ""streaming"" the show, it was just starting the third and final season. It's low on budget but high on quality story lines and character development. All of the episodes are uncensored versions from New Zealand.

The two reasons I do not give this 5 stars is the following:

1) There are only 2 special features in this entire set. A short video where the main cast talk about their respective characters and a commentary track for the first episode.

and

2) The lack of 5.1 surround on a blu-ray set. It is only in English 2.0.",1454457600,2,775,4.287671232876712

6891235,3,B00R041A9E,"Long ago, the Norse God pantheon descended to live on Earth, specifically Norway. To do so, they inhabited a succession of human bodies. Then, 140 years ago, a group of mortals started hunting them, burning down the gods' homes and killing them.  Well, the gods couldn't be killed; but their human vessels could.  So the gods secretly boarded a ship and sailed to a land where they thought they'd be safe. An island near the bottom of the southern hemisphere  New Zealand.

And that brings us to present day Auckland. It's Axl Johnson's 21st birthday. He has his two flatmates, Zeb and Gaia, to help him celebrate. Along with a stolen trampoline. And a goodlooking woman in a short tight dress who tries to kill him. Twice.

And then his cousin and 3 older brothers take him to a meeting in the woods. More than a meeting  it is a coming of age ceremony. It is time for Axl to become a god.

Yep. This gangly immature man is Odin, Fatherall of the Norse Gods. And his brothers are gods, too. The trouble is, none of them will have their full god-like powers restored until the prophecy is fullfilled: ""Odin will find his Frigg and the full powers of Asgard will once again flow through our veins.""

Over three seasons we watch the travails, the conquests and fights and the heartbreaks of the Johnsons and the other Norse gods. Underlying it all is the quest for Odin's destined mate, Frigg, who may not yet know she is Frigg if she hasn't turned 21.

""The Almighty Johnsons"" originally aired 2011-13 in New Zealand. I'm glad to say that the end of season 3 does not leave you hanging. This is probably because the show had been cancelled after 2 seasons, and fan protests brought it back for a 3rd  so I suspect the producers decided that the 3rd season needed to show some resolution.

There are parts about this series that I enjoyed. The off-beat characters are funny and inventive. For example, a sheep-farmer named Derrick is really Thor. Immensely strong and little thick, he does love his hammer.  And Colin Gunderson, successful and venal businessman is actually Loki, the god of fire and nasty tricks. He is a great bad guy.

The plotting of the various episodes can be hilarious, too. Nothing is classic mythology-like, this is over-the-top plotting more like a Terry Pratchett novel. That's good, actually, because real Norse mythology always seemed dark and depressing to me. That said, though, it took me until episode 6 of the 1st season before I stopped wondering if this series was going to be worth my time. And then I binge-watched through some good episodes. And then I stalled on some tedious episodes (especially in season 2). Repeat.

The disclaimer on the disc case states: ""This program includes material that may not be appropriate for younger viewers. Viewer discretion is advised. May contain suggestive dialogue, coarse language, sexual content, and violence."" This is a massive understatement. The F-bomb and other sexual language is constant. The nakedness and sex is constant.  Recreational drug use is prevalent. The violence, however, is average.

English subtitles are available on all the episodes, and I enjoyed watching the show with them. How else would I know that the goddess who pronounced her name Shoff-in was spelled Sjfn.

The BluRay/DVD sets have two Bonus Extras, both on the 1st disc of Season 1.
A.  ""Interviews With the Cast"" (5 minutes) No subtitles on this, which has short interviews with Emmett Skilton (plays Axl), Dean O'Gorman (plays Anders), Tim Balme (plays Mike), Jared Turner (plays Ty) and Ben Barrington (plays Olaf).
B.  Commentary Track for Episode 1, Season 1. Commentators are Tim Balme, Emmett Skilton and Mark Beesley (director). This was recorded in March 2011. Beesley says: ""It's hard to tell, when you're first watching this show. Is it serious? Is it a thriller? Is it scifi, is it fantasy?""
They wanted to avoid the conventions of fantasy and scifi, and I'd say they definitely succeeded in that.
I didn't notice this until I watched episode 1 with the commentary and they pointed it out. Near the beginning, Axl is chasing a woman, literally, outside in the very cold night. His 3 older brothers chase after him. You can see everybody's breath but Hod's. A clue to which god he is.

Overall, I liked the humor and off-the-wall characters. I liked the twists and turns and unusual-ness of the plotting. But the cussing and sex was repetitive to the point of detracting from the show. What could have been cool plots got watered down or interrupted too often. I guess I'm not the right demographic for this show. So my rating is that it is a bit better than just OK - say 3.4 stars rounded down to 3.

It's simply a very fun show with a cast that clearly loves their roles, and the regular nods to Norse mythology (integral to the plot) make it a fun research piece, too.  While it's somewhat loosely based on said mythology, I find this show surprisingly easy to relate to, especially in terms of the main character (Axl) and his struggle to find his place as a twentysomething everyman (who happens to be the reincarnation of the Norse god, Odin).  The rest of the cast is amazingly strong and each character seems to get plenty of attention as the series progresses, and characters you may have forgotten in one season show up again to refresh the storyline from time to time.  In short, it's a fun show with a unique New Zealand flavor that should really have been continued, second only to Firefly in the criminality of its cancellation.",1444780800,2,953,4.654761904761905

Will be re-watching from time to time, I'm sure.  The story was fun, the episode writing was good, the characters were well done, and the acting was good to great.",1437955200,,334,4.285714285714286
6891251,5,B00R041A9E,"Love this show. Was so surprised to see how cheap the whole series was. I haven't finished the series yet but my sister and I have really been enjoying it. We found it on Netflix and had to have it. Much better to watch on blue ray.

Really interesting fun entertainment.

I like all kinds of shows with all kinds of genres but what I noticed about this show was that it had the PERFECT amount of everything without it going too extreme from one to the other. It has a good amount of comedy, which is refreshing and makes it easy to watch. While other times it has very deep and serious moments, and others you'll worry when no one else seems to. You'll feel for the characters because some are so likeable and you'll want the best while others, you can't wait to be rid of.

It's an easy to watch show.",1437868800,,803,4.201298701298701

6891253,5,B00R041A9E,"I just finished watching season three and this has become one of my favorite TV shows of all time.  The idea is unique and creative with Norse gods/goddesses living in downtown Auckland, NZ.  But,is very believable and fun to watch.

The actors were great and I fell in love with the show during the first episode.  They must have known it was going to end because the last episode(s) tied up any loose strings and it ended beautifully.  I wish American TV shows would tie up loose ends instead of just ending on a cliffhanger never to be seen again.

The language is a bit rough at times but I think other countries allow more in the way of language and nudity than American TV audiences are familiar with.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to others.

I wish there would be more seasons but as they ended it clearly, I don't see how there could be more to add.  But this is a series that I will watch again and enjoy it all over.",1436745600,,945,4.293785310734464

6891262,5,B00R041A9E,"What a wonderful surprise!  I listlessly watched a Netflix episode - I was unimpressed with the effects and the slightly different presentations.  Meaning the effects were more in line with an old Star Trek tv episode than what I've come to expect lately. Scenes that would have been drawn out and made much more bombastic in an American show were abrupt and to the point.  After the first episode, however, I became a little curious about the brothers' interactions with each other so I stuck it out... I am so very happy I did!  What a genuine gem.  Diamond in the rough as it were.  The premise is silly but unique.  As previously stated, the effects aren't to write home about, but who cares?!  After I got to know the Johnsons in the 2nd episode a bit more, I was hooked.  Funny, surprising, and written without the expected formulaic moldering cuts from every tv fantasy(?) show from well-known American shows.  Also, I liked the music.  I think most of it is New Zealand originals, again, unique in my experience.

If you enjoy humor and personalities and all the hoopla that goes along with those - don't miss this!  It's only 3 seasons, but again, unlike countless American shows, they actually have an ending.  Enjoy!  Also, a bit of a warning here - I was a little shocked at all the sex scenes.  They do it well, but I'm a little old-fashioned and until I got into the spirit of it, I was a bit taken-aback.",1434672000,5,1419,4.5058823529411764
6891263,5,B00R041A9E,"Purchased this complete set of DVD's after a friend mentioned enjoying it. Although at times the characters' immaturity was aggravating, overall the storyline was compelling and the ending resolved the fate of the characters, which was a relief, as that doesn't always happen. :) If you're interested even a little in Norse mythology this is a fun series.",1434326400,,355,5.137931034482759
6891264,4,B00R041A9E,"Something very 'down to earth' about this series.  Has a charm that I haven't seen in any American TV series!  It's kinda hard to know why, but you find yourself eagerly watching one episode after another.",1434240000,2,205,4.666666666666667

An unlikely premise -- the experiences of a family coming to terms with their heritage as Norse gods -- which could have been silly but, thanks to a great cast and good writing, is not.  At times humorous, and at times serious.  It doesn't hurt that the family is full of very good looking young studs who do not hesitate to remove their shirts, either.
