8385879,1,B0030HJERK,"I love this show however this DVD will only work on Pal 2 whatever that is? I guess it's England and maybe the
East coast So, why did this company sell it to someone
On the West Coast? I tried this DVD set in 4 different DVD player and my computer it wouldn't work in any of them' I watch this program on Netflix before they took it off. The BBC series is very good !
To add insult to injury it cost me more to send it back than I paid for it plus time spent wrapping it and going to the post office.

8385881,5,B0030HJERK,"I got hooked on USA's version of Being Human with Sam Huntington as the werewolf. I had to see the British version. It's very good!  I could get hooked on this one, too!",1380326400,,169,4.121212121212121
8385882,5,B0030HJERK,"Season 1 - Very inventive series, which morphs somewhat along the way during it's first 6 episode season. A vampire. a
werewolf and a ghost all share a small house in England. They desperately want to simply fit in, be accepted and not hurt
anyone. It's got a lot of dry wit and some real emotions as well, with strong performances throughout. Someone remarked
it's like `Seinfeld' with undead characters, and that is part of the appeal early on, seeing these characters more in human,
often humorous ways than in scary supernatural ones. But over the course of the season, the supernatural and darker tones
become more and more prominent. This leads to some confusion in tone at times, along with some messiness as to just
what the rules of the game are for these creatures. There's also a few hard to take leaps of faith (e.g. a human character
who hardly seems fazed when he leans the true identity of our three leads.). When it first turned from `dramedy' to drama,
and the supernatural elements began to grow stronger I was very disappointed, as it seemed like the show was losing what
made it unique, but then it regained it's balance by amping up the emotions along with the other-worldly, and making the
characters' pain at being trapped between worlds, and their love for each other moving and real, while avoiding (mostly)
clichs or the familiar. I'll be very curious to see where it goes from here.

Season 2 - 8 episodes. While still uneven at times, with it's goofy moments of humor not always meshing smoothly with it's darker
and more emotional sides, the series has grown even stronger in it's 2nd season. While still not (for me) up with the all time great
series like The Wire or Mad Men or Breaking Bad, at it's best, it's an amazingly potent mix of heartrending drama, dark, off-beat
humor and some effective horror as well. But this is horror with all the rules reversed, with the `monsters' being the human race,
and the heroes our vampire werewolf and ghost who simply want to live like other people. At times, in an odd way it reminded me
of ""Dexter"", the outsider with scary possibilities, who wants to fit in. But whereas Dexter is all about emotions repressed, here the
emotions are on the sleeve (occasionally a bit too much, and there are a few soapy moments). Much like the first season this starts
strong, seems to lose its way a bit in the middle, with some forced humor, and repetitive moments but finishes with such a kick that
its easy to forgive any lapses. The acting is on a very high level, the writing is witty and human, and the direction and camerawork
can be very effective at creating mood and scares on a TV budget. Not perfect perhaps, but it's a rare TV show that can make me think,
laugh, cry, and send a shiver down my spine all in one episode. Some great and inventive use of rock tunes to set the mood tops it off.",1356566400,,2865,4.530888030888031
8385883,4,B0030HJERK,I like this show..about the blu-ray. Pretty good transfer for the most part. There are times when the shots don't look like HD. But over all..very nice smooth colors.,1283126400,,166,4.758620689655173
8385884,5,B0030HJERK,"American buyers should be aware that this BluRay set is exactly the same as the two individual releases that came out in the UK, meaning it is encoded at a 50hz refresh rate, which is INCOMPATIBLE with most American BluRay players and TV sets (yes, the PS3 is one of the players these won't work on). the only difference is an added cardboard slipcover.

You have to have one of the following two setups to play this (or any other) 1080/50hz disc:

1. a player that can output 50hz discs at their native 50hz rate, PLUS a TV that can accept a 50hz 1080i input signal
2. a player that can convert the 50hz refresh to the 60hz standard preferred by American sets. This is similar to a PAL-to-NTSC standards conversion

VERY FEW American players/HDTVs can cope with 50hz discs. The Oppo players (BDP-80 and BDP-83) are among the few that can both output 50hz native AND convert it to 60hz, depending on your needs.

MOST British television shows these days are shot in 1080/50hz, because the Eurpoean HDTV standard is still on the same 50hz refresh rate that the old PAL standard was on. Many (but not all) British BluRays are encoded at that same 50hz rate to keep the signal pure/as intended, although some are converted to 60hz to appeal to the import/export market, so it's always best to do your research on these things!

If you'd like to evaluate your equipment to see if it compatible with 50hz or not, check out this site: [...]

Bear in mind the site might not be an all-inclusive list, but it's a good place to start your research. Bottom line: if you're unsure whether your TV can do 50hz, you need a player that is able to convert the 50hz signal to a 60hz one, or have an external processor that can.

*****

UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!  There will be a Region-A (American-compatible) release of Season 2 happening September 21st (to go along with the US release of Season 1 which is already out), so if you can wait a couple months, those of you without the 50hz technology will be able to finally see all the episodes without possibly importing the British set which likely won't work on your equipment.",1280188800,22,2112,4.536842105263158
