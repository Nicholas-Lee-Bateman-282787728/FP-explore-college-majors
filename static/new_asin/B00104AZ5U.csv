3045508,4,B00104AZ5U,"This video, while not authorized by the Zappa Family Trust is a cool document of the short-lived 1988 Zappa big band. A warm introduction is given by Frank in Spanish (learned ""parrot fashion) and the tight, well-seasoned band of the ""Broadway The Hard Way"" album kicks in with a mixture of fresh material and old favorites. Five horns, Ike Willis on vocals, Mike Keneally on stunt guitar, and a real-live Synclavier on stage. And some truly mind bending guitar solos by the maestro. Great fun. The aspect ratio is 4 by 3, the audio is stereo, and the video quality is ok, but not great. It's all about the music. If you enjoy this type of entertainment, you will not be disappointed.",1224806400,2,684,4.614754098360656
3045509,3,B00104AZ5U,"It's not an official legal Zappa release. You can get it for free on torrent sites, possibly a better copy. It's a good quality video taken from a TV special. It's great, but you shouldnt pay 30 dollars for it. For an unrelated reason, maybe, visit Zappateers.com. It's an awesome 1988 concert with Bruce Fowler, Walt Fowler, Ike Willis, Ed Mann, Bobby Martin, Scott Tunes, Chad Wakerman, Mike Kenelly, and I forget the other horn players. Some of the songs are The Black Page, Big Swifty, Black Napkins, Sofa, a cover of I Am The Walrus, Strictly Genteel and many more great songs. By the way, that IS Strictly Genteel at the end and not a Sofa variation as another reviewer said, Sofa is played in the middle of the show. I'm a musician, I know and play both pieces quite well, I am very familiar with the different arrangments of both over the years, and I can tell you without a doubt that the concert ends with a great performance of Strictly Genteel.",1217894400,22,956,4.5

This is clearly a 2nd or 3rd generation dub from some videotape, so already, it's NOT the best video.  Given that, I could deal with it, and occasional additional distortion to the picture, but what's incredibly frustrating are the drop-outs in the sound!  At least every 5 or 10 mins, there's NOT just a click, but an actual drop-out!  At least 20-25 drop-outs are scattered throughout the whole thing, and occasionally, other minor distortions in the sound, which I could ALSO deal with, but NOT DROP-OUTS!  It's basically unlistenable, and it's unlikely that I will watch this again, despite the fact that the performance is cool -- it's just an excercise in frustration.

I was warned by some of the guys on the Zappa.com forum, and they were right.  I wouldn't pay 3 dollars for this thing.

3045536,5,B00104AZ5U,This is a band that was close to Frank's heart. You can tell by this show just how good this group is. A nice mix of songs from throughout Frank's catalog so far. This is a straight show no overdups this is what was heard that night as they played. The band is very tight but having fun with the music as well. Frank used humor in his not only to make a point but also to entertain as well. These guys are good listen to I Am the Walrus it is spot on. Now of course I am a big Frank Zappa fan and have been following his music from the beginning so I was already sold on this before I heard it but this is a special threat to not hear these guys but to watch them as well.

3045538,4,B00104AZ5U,"Too bad so many of you folks got a (apparently) bad copy, mine is definitely better than the hi-fi VHS tape it replaced. In fact I think that's exactly what it is, a VERY well done job of capturing a 1st gen VHS, or maybe even from the source tapes themselves. (Though the VHS I had still had a few Spanish TV commercials, which was pretty cool the first few times I watched it).

And it is also better than the bootleg DVD a friend downloaded from the Internet several years ago and burned on a DVDr, which might be what many of you are getting (I bought mine right here on Amazon from a 3rd party vendor).

There are 2 sound drop-outs on mine but, if my memory of the VHS is correct, are right before (or after) commercial breaks. So, yes, both were on both the VHS and the bootleg DVDr so are probably on the source as well and can't be fixed unless ZFT has their audio tapes (which I'm sure they do, Frank was recording EVERYTHING by then).

I can also say it is better looking and sounding than a good half-dozen concert DVDs I have that ARE official releases.

Until the ZFT pulls their collective heads out and officially release this, or any show from the 88 tour, I was MORE than happy to spend $12 on it!!

So, until there's an alternate choice, 4 stars from me. When there's another version to compare it to, well, we'll see!",1348617600,,1336,4.244094488188976
3045539,3,B00104AZ5U,"This is difficult to rate.  This performance was from the 1988 tour that has been regarded as one of the best live bands Frank ever took out on tour.  It was the band behind such great cds as The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life, Broadway The Hard Way and Make A Jazz Noise Here as well as some performances on the later YCDTOSA discs.  That alone should make this a worthwhile investment.  This DVD only received 3 stars from me for a few reasons.  First off the multi-generational copies that are being sold from vendors really makes for a tough video to watch.  I didn't notice the sound drop out on my copy as much as other reviewers did but maybe I just didn't pay attention. Possibly some discs are worse than others. The disc for sale here says it's only 90 minutes long. That may be a mistake as the copy I purchased quite a while ago is over 2 hours long.  Though I did purchase it elsewhere.  You can download for free the 2 hour plus performance off You Tube if you like and the picture is remarkably clean.  I've been watching it for a better part of an hour now and I haven't noticed any sound problems. All in all I am genuinely pleased with the quality of the sound and picture of the download.  I'm watching it on a large screen high def monitor and it looks and sounds great.  I don't necessarily agree or support pirated material but if Gail and the ZFT clan don't see fit to ever release this material, I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to grab it.  (ZFT clan, where are The Roxy performances??)  When I purchased this way back when I did assume it had some ties to Frank or the FZT.  Apparently not.  On a side note, you may want to pick up a copy of the new book by Andrew Greenaway called ""Zappa The Hard Way"".  It documents the 1988 tour.  It's a great book and is full of interviews with the band and FZ himself.",1323475200,,1849,4.192634560906516

3045541,1,B00104AZ5U,"Hi:

This is a great performance from a 1988 show in Spain.  It was broadcast on TV and recorded on a VCR.  After passing several generations, it was bootlegged.  With a little searching on the internet, I am sure that you can find the entire show.  There is a version that did not have a song interrupted by a Pepsi Commercial.  I would not support bootleggers buy purchasing this item and I think a crisper music and video version exists on the internet.

If you like all live performances, I would recommend from the ZFT, The Torture Never Stops and when the ZFT get around to releasing it, the Roxie Shows.

3045542,3,B00104AZ5U,"Of course the Zappa tour of '88 is the stuff of leg ends, Scott Thunes squaring up to Ed Mann (you looking at my bass percussion boy?) etc. So it was which much anticipation that I purchased this DVD of the Barcelona concert, however upon viewing I was initially pretty disappointed. The quality of the picture is not good by today's large screen standards, it has a hazy, contrast-and-definition-lacking, fuzzy bear quality to it. I suspect this concert was broadcast on Spanish TV back in '88 and this is a 'cash in' transfer to DVD. It looks like someone who works at El Spaniol ITV has got a VHS out the back door and burned it to DVD on a PC in their bedroom. Now to the sound quality, well it's kinda Lo-Fi at best. It's stereo but the mix is BASS HEAVY, lacking in top, detail and some instruments (trombone) are not even in the mix, eg. when Bruce Fowler takes his solo! The worse part is there are drop outs, and very bad clicks and pops all the way throughout which really does interfere with your enjoyment of the material, especially when you crank it up. This is a travesty really when you consider Frank Zappa's continual quest to make his recordings the best possible sound quality he could all throughout his career. I don't quite know what's going on here, I mean this is not an 'official DVD' and I suspect royalties are not making their way to the Zappa estate from it, you certainly could never buy this on the high street, should it even be for sale on amazon? Also the photo on the front of Frank is not congruent with his look in '88, it's from a totally different era when he had long hair.

Now to the up side. what makes this DVD is the actual musical content and that band. This really is the Best Band You Have Never Heard in Your Life! They swing from classic reworked vocal Zappa, through reggae Bolero & Stravinsky references, to 80's catalogue and of course top notch instrumentals like Big Swifty and Water Melon in Easter Hay, which are nothing short of SUBLIME. These guys really can play, the band are very tight and the arrangements are complex - it is simply a joy to behold. Verdict? I would say ultimately it's only a tenner or so delivered so buy it and if you can't live with the sound once you watched it a few times sell it here again. Finally, the Zappa estate must know about this DVD, here's an idea: Get hold of the original footage and clean it up, and if there is a UMRK recording of the concert use that for the sound. Then we could have a pristine remastered version of this concert with 5.1 and all the bells and whistles, it would sell like hot cakes. They could maybe even get some interview footage of the participants for the DVD extras and then we could finally find out what went down on that '88 tour which caused it to implode and leave Frank $400,000 in the red.

3045543,1,B00104AZ5U,"When I saw this under ""Today's Deals"", I got excited. I thought maybe this was finally being released officially.
As soon as I got to the product page, I could tell right away it is indeed a bootleg. For starters, the label is ""101 Distribution."" Have you ever heard of it? I haven't.
Second, the cover art....neither the stage nor the large picture of Frank is from 1988. Not even close.
It's bad enough that there are bootleggers making money off of this garbage on Ebay, but do we have to be wary of Amazon now too?
There has been an ""unofficial"" fan copy of this in circulation for years, and the quality is better than this one (re-dubbed audio and relevant artwork). Best of all, it's for FREE trade, not selling. You just have to know where to look.

Until such time that they release an official version of this made from the master recording, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money and find a better copy elsewhere.",1272844800,2,951,4.4655172413793105

And if you are like me, and I think you are if you are reading this, you have everything that FZ and the ZFT has put out in the market already, so this is a four star based on this information...

We would, I speak for a lot of FZ fans, love to have the ZFT put this out proper.  The music deserves it, the fans deserve it, and obviously FZ wanted to do it or he would not have filmed it.  So, do us all a favor DZ, GZ and put this out so I can toss this bad copy of very good music into the bin.

I suspect this concert was broadcast on Spanish TV back in '88 and this is a 'cash in' transfer to DVD. It looks like someone who works at El Spaniol ITV has got a VHS out the back door and burned it to DVD on a PC in their bedroom. Now to the sound quality, well it's kinda Lo-Fi at best. It's stereo but the mix is BASS HEAVY, lacking in top, detail and some instruments (trombone) are not even in the mix, eg. when Bruce Fowler takes his solo! The worse part is there are drop outs, and very bad clicks and pops all the way throughout which really does interfere with your enjoyment of the material, especially when you crank it up. This is a travesty really when you consider Frank Zappa's continual quest to make his recordings the best possible sound quality he could all throughout his career. I don't quite know what's going on here, I mean this is not an 'official DVD' and I suspect royalties are not making their way to the Zappa estate from it, you certainly could never buy this on the high street, should it even be for sale on amazon? Also the photo on the front of Frank is not congruent with his look in '88, it's from a totally different era when he had long hair.

Now to the up side. what makes this DVD is the actual musical content and that band. This really is the Best Band You Have Never Heard in Your Life! They swing from classic reworked vocal Zappa, through reggae Bolero & Stravinsky references, to 80's catalogue and of course top notch instrumentals like Big Swifty and Water Melon in Easter Hay, which are nothing short of SUBLIME. These guys really can play, the band are very tight and the arrangements are complex - it is simply a joy to behold. Verdict? I would say ultimately it's only a tenner or so delivered so buy it and if you can't live with the sound once you watched it a few times sell it here again. Finally, the Zappa estate must know about this DVD, here's an idea: Get hold of the original footage and clean it up, and if there is a UMRK recording of the concert use that for the sound. Then we could have a pristine remastered version of this concert with 5.1 and all the bells and whistles, it would sell like hot cakes. They could maybe even get some interview footage of the participants for the DVD extras and then we could finally find out what went down on that '88 tour which caused it to implode and leave Frank $400,000 in the red.

3280040,1,B00104AZ5U,"When I saw this under ""Today's Deals"", I got excited. I thought maybe this was finally being released officially.
As soon as I got to the product page, I could tell right away it is indeed a bootleg. For starters, the label is ""101 Distribution."" Have you ever heard of it? I haven't.
Second, the cover art....neither the stage nor the large picture of Frank is from 1988. Not even close.
It's bad enough that there are bootleggers making money off of this garbage on Ebay, but do we have to be wary of Amazon now too?
There has been an ""unofficial"" fan copy of this in circulation for years, and the quality is better than this one (re-dubbed audio and relevant artwork). Best of all, it's for FREE trade, not selling. You just have to know where to look.

Until such time that they release an official version of this made from the master recording, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money and find a better copy elsewhere.",1272844800,2,951,4.4655172413793105

3280042,4,B00104AZ5U,"Yes, this is a copy.  And as far as I know, this is not authorized from the ZFT... but, it is good music.  Hell, this is great music.  And if you are like me, and I think you are if you are reading this, you have everything that FZ and the ZFT has put out in the market already, so this is a four star based on this information...

We would, I speak for a lot of FZ fans, love to have the ZFT put this out proper.  The music deserves it, the fans deserve it, and obviously FZ wanted to do it or he would not have filmed it.  So, do us all a favor DZ, GZ and put this out so I can toss this bad copy of very good music into the bin.
