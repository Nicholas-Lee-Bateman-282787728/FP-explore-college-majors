8527003,4,B008DH9GRA,"This video is to go with your owners manual. I found it useful to learn more about my camera, mainly for two reasons. The first reason is that it goes more in-depth than the manual and explains the functions. Second is that I personally learn better by watching than reading. I gave it it four stars because I feel the man speaks too quickly. I guess they had a time limit and had to get as much information as possible with in that time period. It is almost an hour and a half, if he had spoken slower I guess it could be more like two hours. At least I can watch it over and over, so it's like having a guy explain your camera to you for an hour and a half as many times as you want. I'd recomend it, especially if your an amature photographer, which you probably are if you're using an entry level dslr like me. In short it is a very informative dvd, I just wish he would have spoke a little slower.",1363305600,8,902,4.044692737430168
