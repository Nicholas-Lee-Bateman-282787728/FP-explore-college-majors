172592,3,0966332539,Its a great play...wish it was still being performed but not worth the $98 dvd purchase ticket they are asking for it. :(,1389225600,2,121,4.304347826086956
172593,4,0966332539,"Came fast, and as described. since it was a live production you need to watch on a large screen, which wasn't available to me.",1386374400,,126,4.291666666666667
172594,5,0966332539,"Even though an older production, the quality of the dance and music coupled with the ultimate story that is related makes this video a timeless classic. My daughter is enjoying it with me as much as I enjoyed it when I first viewed it 20 years ago. Outstanding music and choreography with the fast pacing keeps the interest of any lover of the arts. Highly recommended!",1365897600,2,369,4.606060606060606
172595,5,0966332539,"I first saw this performed live at Victory Christian Center in Tulsa; where it originated. I then saw it every year following on Easter Sunday until they stopped performing it (wanting to now focus on other performances.)
I bought the videocassete at one of the shows, and have since worn it out watching it over and over. I have probably seen this play 30+ times. It is a wonderful allegorical story of the fall of the angels, the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden, and of the Life, death, and Ressurection of Jesus.
Yes, it's a Christian movie. It is also beautiful, and powerful, and haunting. I wept the first time I saw it. I am still moved to tears at times.
Buy this movie. It is worth far more than the $(...) asking price.",1014681600,17,739,4.401459854014599

7793874,5,0966332539,bought this because my younger sister seen the live performance on TV and we only caught it from the middle to the end but she loved it. It never came on again so I decided to look for it online. :( unfortunately we still have not watched this due to VHS and at the time of purchase it was only available on VHS.
