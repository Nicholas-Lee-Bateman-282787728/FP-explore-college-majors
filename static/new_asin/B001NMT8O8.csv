8327371,3,B001NMT8O8,"The fine team at Creature Productions have released their best film to date.  ""Dark Dimensions"" is an enjoyable, well crafted adventure film that showcases exactly what this John Lewis led group is capable of.

The Book of Keos is a highly sought after artifact.  Centuries later, the Monks who protected the book, have found the book and continue to protect it from those who would open the pathway to heaven and hell.  Darrel, while translating the ancient text, is under intense scrutiny and danger as the forces gather around him.

Cast members Joel Wynkoop, Natasha Raabe, Nick Cuti, Erica Heflin, Mckea Dietrich, Al Rosenthal, and Andrew Vigo put in credible performances.  Nick Cuti is a convincing FBI boss while retaining  humor in the face of the unknown.  WIth any film, there has to be humor, and Louiss, the one eyed man (""I've Got my eye on you..."") keeps the edge off the film and provides comedic breaks much like Gabby Hayes used to for Roy Rogers.

If there is any fault with the film, it is the  beginning sequence with the massacre.  Sure, this is no blood bath, but some blood would have been good on the blades and clothes of the monks.

Great things are in the cards for Cuti and his film making compatriots.  Keep an eye on'im!
