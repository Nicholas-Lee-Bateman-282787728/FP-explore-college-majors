8230863,5,B000Y1XCO6,"My Granson is 5 and he loved the part about the Dinosaurs, but didn't care for the the part about the Horses. It wasn't very interesting.",1363564800,,137,4.3076923076923075
8230864,5,B000Y1XCO6,"I love the energy in BackPack Jack.
A fun way to learn about things.
I bought a few. I give them as gifts.",1359504000,,106,3.652173913043478
8230865,5,B000Y1XCO6,"My son is absolutely crazy about dinosaurs.  He loves all the Hard Hat Harry Series very much, especially All about Dinosaurs.  I would recommend this video to children who are wild about dinosaurs.",1339286400,,198,4.96969696969697
8230866,5,B000Y1XCO6,"My son loves the ""Back Pack Jack"" series of videos and ""All About Dinosaurs"" was no exception.  Its a short video which is an upside for a 2-year old attention span.  The bonus section on horses is just that, a bonus, so I won't waste much time talking about it.  The dinosaur section is great for young watchers as there is no violence or blood to frighten.  I especially like the little quizzes on dino facts throughout the video.  Perfect for my dino-obsessed 2 year old son.",1334534400,,478,4.448275862068965
8230867,1,B000Y1XCO6,the DVD did not work at all it had a crack on it I will not buy anything from this seller again,1291939200,,95,3.3636363636363638
8230868,5,B000Y1XCO6,"I got this for my two grandsons ages 6 and 8.  They both enjoyed watching the whole video and then went outside to look for fossils, using exactly the method the video showed.  It is educational and well done.  If you want a children's' video about the history of dinosaurs it is great, if you just want to entertain a 2 year old with visions of dinosaurs this is probably not the correct video.",1228953600,4,395,4.3108108108108105
8230869,1,B000Y1XCO6,"I didn't like this video at all and neither did my son who LOVES dinosaurs.  First, it's mainly about fossils and only has about 6 minutes of dinosaurs in the 20 minute video.  The DVD states that it's 55 minutes long but the dinosaur section is 20 and then the rest is about horses.  If it's titled ""All about Dinosaurs"" then why is more than 1/2 of it about horses.  I'm very disappointed!",1218067200,5,391,4.315068493150685
8230870,5,B000Y1XCO6,"I purchased this DVD, for my two sons, ages 6 and 9.  Both seem to enjoy watching it.  I do think it is better suited for the younger child, but both found it educational without being too serious.  We viewed the DVD together and found the new format featuring Backpack Jack and his friends very appealing.  Hope there are more to come.",1204243200,5,336,4.370967741935484
