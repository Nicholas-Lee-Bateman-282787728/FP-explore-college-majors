7987726,5,B00008XERB,"I must agree with the previous reviewer for 'Wild Arms' volume 1-2.  There was nothing really special about this anime, since each show didn't really lead to a main story line. Most of the episodes pretty much stuck to the same plot: Sheyenne trying to find his body and the girls trying to steal...er...search for new treasures. Most of the shows in volume one and two, had its own storyline and had very little correlation to how Sheyenne ended up they way he did. Volume three started to get interesting since it dove into the mysteries of Sheyenne's past. Thus, giving hints as to what happened to him. I'm not saying that one and two were not good.  I found the episodes rather amusing, however; the show strayed from the main plot.
So what about volume four? Well, it's a lot better than three.  Yes, it gets better with each volume-hoping volume 5 is better than four.  The first episode for this volume deals with Mirabelle and her unwanted betrothed. Thus, this episode has nothing to do with the main story line. More filler...but it was amusing to watch a bunch of vampires attack Sheyenne for his tasty blood. The next two episodes deal with what happened to Sheyenne's body, and why it was taken from him. People who enjoy the game will see some familiar faces in these episodes.  (Zed, Irving, and that dog guardian..can't remember the name.)  The last episode of this volume, is somewhat filler. I can't say it's really a filler episode since the ending deals with someone from Sheyenne's past.  (Hey I'm not giving anything away. Go see it for yourself! :P) This is also a fun episode to watch.
As for the DVD, it comes with two music videos, outtakes, model sheets, Japanese dvd preview, and ADV trailors.  The music videos are nice and the outakes are rather funny.
So far, I enjoyed this volume of Wild Arms a lot and I think its must see. So far each volume gets better and better, and hopefully the last volume will top this one!  ...",1056844800,,1955,4.562857142857143
