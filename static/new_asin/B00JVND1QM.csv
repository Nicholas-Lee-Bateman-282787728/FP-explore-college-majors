6391701,5,B00JVND1QM,Awesome film,1483574400,,12,5.5
6391702,5,B00JVND1QM,"Haven't watch yet. Didn't know it cost money, but I love AC/DC",1473638400,,62,4.25
6391703,1,B00JVND1QM,I didn't like the DVD,1466812800,,21,3.4
6391704,2,B00JVND1QM,"Two discs, a 15 minute DVD and CD with music. Not what I expected. Disappointed.",1463702400,,80,4.4
6391705,2,B00JVND1QM,I have just gotten this video and I was anticipating that this dvd would  cover how he has gotten the AC/DC gig. It is only nothing but interview clips and a music video of his former band Geordie which can all be found on YouTube.  The saving grace of this video/music cd set is the Geordie music which I really enjoyed very much and it is hard to find.,1429056000,,354,4.115942028985507
6391706,2,B00JVND1QM,"It is sad to say this dvd does not give it you anything behind the scenes or the story of how Brian joined AC/DC. If you are a fan then you already know but it would have been nice to see some new info. The dvd is just pieced together interviews that don't give you anything at all. The cd is the only saving grace. It gives you songs from Brian's days in Geordie, his pre- AC/DC band. Which, if you are a diehard fan, you probably own.",1427414400,3,436,3.965909090909091
6391707,5,B00JVND1QM,am a AC/DC fan and this is great to have,1414800000,,40,3.1
8654036,1,B00JVND1QM,"Just a bizarre watch, the audio is about three seconds ahead of the video, they only play about 60 seconds of great concert footage for each song and you get morons talking about nothing or things that were pretty obvious. They didn't do the great AC/DC any favors with this crap.",1493856000,,280,4.509803921568627
8654037,1,B00JVND1QM,"The interviewees seem to not understand Rock N Roll, AC/DC or Brian Johnson. Like they were reading more into the band for their own egos.",1490659200,,138,4.56
8654038,2,B00JVND1QM,I get two stars for the music. The audio track was off sync with the video. The information was good and informative,1486339200,,116,4.318181818181818
8654039,1,B00JVND1QM,The audio does not sync with the video. Tried it three times. Not worth your time.,1486166400,,82,4.1875
8654040,1,B00JVND1QM,I was robbed. Terrible waste of my money. Nothing about his AC/DC stint. Just some grainy videos copied from worn out old VHS tape and a cd of old Geordie songs I don't care for. Some jackboot selling this crap is laughing all the way to the bank with my money.,1485820800,,261,4.137254901960785
8654041,1,B00JVND1QM,The beginning of this video was so bad I stopped watching after 3 minutes. Audio and visual were out of sync.,1485475200,,109,4.238095238095238
8654042,4,B00JVND1QM,"I love ACDC, and overall it was good.  Have seen better documentary DVD's on the band, but would say worth watching",1485129600,,115,4.476190476190476
8654043,5,B00JVND1QM,True no frills R&R,1484697600,,18,3.75
8654044,3,B00JVND1QM,Solid reviews of some of AC-DC catalog. Just wish the concert footage would've been alot clearer and remixed with the audio records of the concert from the mix board.,1484092800,,166,4.758620689655173
8654045,1,B00JVND1QM,The sound timing was way off,1484092800,,28,3.8333333333333335
