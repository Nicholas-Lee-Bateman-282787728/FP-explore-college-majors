2475827,5,B000DZG5R4,This movie taps into the seedy subjects that main stream Hollywood wouldn't really touch. It is Sal Mineo's best performance.,1323734400,,125,5.3
2475828,2,B000DZG5R4,"After waiting years for a proper release of this, one of my all-time favorite films, I am sad to see that it is a censored print.  While the infamous poolside scene is included, other scenes have been noticeably trimmed.  Such as the 'crank call' scenes are a bit toned down, and all indications that Sal Mineo's character masturbates and climaxes during his conversation with Nora have been cleverly removed.  A scene where Lawrence (Mineo) is cruising the porno magazine rack and looking at topless models is gone.  The scene where he attacks Elaine Strich in the alley is edited in a way that you cannot tell that he gropes and possibly has sex with her after he strangles her.  The scene where his mother seduces him is cut in a way that you can barely understand what is happening!  The climactic rape scene is softened/shortened a bit, etc.. Even the opening scene is cut, and shots of Sal in his briefs. I realize that this was the first film to show a man in briefs and it was controversial at the time, so I am assuming this is an old print. There are possibly other edits that I am forgetting, but I found this censorship very annoying, especially considering all the garbage that passes for entertainment today, being released uncut.  While the picture quality of ""Who Killed Teddy Bear"" is improved for this legit release, I will be keeping my bootleg, which might be a bit blurry, but is at least presented in it's uncensored glory.  Also I find it strange that I am the only one to notice the cuts...",1308009600,28,1514,4.560885608856089
2475829,5,B000DZG5R4,"Homoerotic indeed! After his unforgettable Plato in ""Rebel Without a Cause"", followed by a profitable series of roles in various mainstream Hollywood movies, Sal Mineo's career was in need of regeneration in the 60s. Mineo was indeed aware of cultural trends, with a boldness to involve in tough, controversial stuff. This one is the right example, full of wonderful touches of camp, sleaze, hints of vintage pulp, exploitation, phone harassment and masturbation (in veiled darkness), then enticing muscle work-out at the gym, exhaustive period dancing of the Twist in seedy NY night club, policeman's lines on investigated cases of sundry sexual aberrations while listening to victim's recounts on tape as little daughter listens on next door in bed, hints of fraternal incest between Sal Mineo and a neurotic, retarded sister whose beloved teddy bear had been murdered... and.... Elaine Stritch trying to bed Juliet Prowse (unsuccessfully, of course). Well... it aint the stuff of Prowse's Elvis or Sinatra musicals... rather nearer to Stritch's Sondheim songs.

All this plus Sal's outfits, when much dressed at all, namely the tightest fitting white jeans ever seen in black & white. The movie was too much for the times and flopped, it was not released in the UK for years, and 11 years later poor Sal Mineo ended up murdered sordidly at 35, before so much more could be achieved. Yet, if not as mamoth as James Dean's, his story is indeed legend.

Today 'Teddy Bear' has been released on DVD in this non-USA format, otherwise only available on VHS. Interestingly, Sal Mineo had produced a staging of John Herbert's prison-gay-themed play ""Fortune and Men's Eyes"" in 1971, the same year a film version of the play was released by MGM, sadly available only on VHS. Shouldn't there be a digital release of both these films for the whole world to enjoy?",1306281600,6,1855,5.01948051948052

For the past several years, I've wanted to get my hands on a copy of the rare 1965 film ""Who Killed Teddy Bear?"". A few months ago I found a cheap bootleg copy and snapped it up, finally popping it in the DVD player last night.

Was it worth the wait? Well, I'm not sorry I watched it, but it wasn't the must-see I was expecting.

In 1965 New York, Juliet Prowse spins the latest records at a nightclub managed by Elaine Stritch. Poor Juliet becomes the target of a telephone stalker and a police detective who specializes in psychosexual criminal behaviour takes it upon himself to protect her.

Nothing too exciting happens until the middle of the film when Sal Mineo is introduced as a busboy at the club who has a mentally-challenged sister to take care of. There is an obtuse flashback that shows the little girl falling down the stairs after Sal leaves her unattended to go make out with a strange girl who stands in the doorway flirting with him. (Oddly, the girl looks like Mineo himself in drag.)

Next Stritch tries to put some lesbian moves on Prowse, who promptly throws her out of the apartment with Stritch only clad in her bra and slip and Prowse's fur coat. Even though Stritch is at least 20 years older, Mineo mistakes her for Prowse and ends up strangling Stritch on a rooftop. This is the first time I've seen Elaine Stritch in anything, having heard of her because she auditioned for the Bea Arthur role of Dorothy in ""The Golden Girls"".

The most famous thing about the film is probably the scene where Mineo works out at the Y in skimpy square-cut swim trunks, not an ounce of fat on his tight, compact frame. (See my screen-grabs in the Images section of this product).

We have a montage of a sexually-frustated Mineo lurking about dirty bookstores and peep shows before he ends up back at the nightclub after-hours with Prowse, who teaches him to dance with wild abandon.

They whip themselves into such a frenzy that Mineo tries to violate Prowse until the cop puts the pieces together and arrives to save her while slapping the daylights out of Mineo, who flees and runs through traffic until he is shot down.

I found this film to encapsulate all the elements of those lurid pulp novels of the '50s and '60s.

It's no masterpiece but interesting as a time capsule and for Mineo in his prime.",1286755200,4,2362,4.536470588235294

2475832,4,B000DZG5R4,"I have such a high regard for this movie, I can not give it a five-star rating.  I take off a point for ""effort.""  Startling?  And effective.  This Region 0 Great Britain DVD presents the first time this movie has been issued (from Network) in a mainstream version but also the first time it was presented to Britain due to censorship there in the sixties when the film was initially released by a new little studio, Magna in 1965.  I thought it my duty to check this out.  A lot of the companies that featured this film in their catalog have been vying for the inclusion from what must have been an edited for television version that cropped up and did not include the now infamous ""pool scene.""  Research shows the Network version was released in January 2009 and after that versions with the pool scene became readily available and, it was a close call, but this DVD too features the body-building/pool scene that fans today want to see of Sal Mineo who like everyone in the cast (Juliet Prowse, Elaine Stritch, Jan Murray) went into an entertaining foray into the underbelly that Sal was working his way back from/into a comeback before his virtually senseless murder.  This film has everything to survive in cult status, and now what might be furthermore impossible, is the task to produce a restored version.  The writing and direction would today lead places, but this film was ahead of its time.  Of several clips posted on youtube, this has everything except the images are not quite as clear in the title sequence of Lawrence and Nora together in his dreams that I believe it should have, but the entirety of the credits themselves are there which is a vast improvement over some versions that have been issued.  The film was still ""ahead of its time"" in 1996 when it was first re-issued on the big screen in cities like San Francisco.  That Sal, found unquestionably to be gay during the events surrounding his murder investigation, could have put gay icons on the map while he was alive but fate seems to have him and the film remain in the troubled zone of James Dean and other rebels, on the verge of something new and exciting, but yet amiss.",1259625600,11,2157,4.588541666666667
2475833,3,B000DZG5R4,"First caveat: beware the VHS version offered through Amazon Marketplace. I bought this and discovered it to be a homemade copy of a copy of a VHS original, with no documentation. The picture quality is dreadful.

That said, the movie is very interesting. True, it's trashy, but fascinating. It's a shame that the 60s were so naive! All that good stuff that they couldn't actually say or show...but my, they certainly hinted! Unless the version I had was censored, I see nothing revealing or titillating about the swimming pool scene. However, in an earlier scene Mineo is wearing white jeans that show more than ample equipment.

Sal Mineo has somehow gained the reputation of being a trashy actor. Why, I don't know. Jimmy Dean may well have been a genius, but for my money, it's Sal Mineo's performance in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE that makes the movie. THE GENE KRUPA STORY has its weaknesses (not least of which is that, over a 40-year span of time no one ages a day!), but Sal is not one of them. His performance is strong throughout. In GIANT apparently his best stuff was destined for the cutting-room floor before it was even filmed, since director George Stevens wanted him on board only for marquee value. I gather it worked: Sal's fans paid their money...and then got two minutes of him onscreen. Can you say ""Rip-off""? (I thought you could.)

There are so many movies worthy of DVD treatment that get neglected while anything made recently gets the full DVD marketing. It's a shame. This movie really does deserve to be looked at again.",1189382400,13,1544,4.711111111111111
2475834,5,B000DZG5R4,"I am an avid fan and collector of the late great Sal Mineo's work
and I have been waiting for this elusive title to be released to DVD
as soon as possible because it is a gem of a movie and
in his body of work in general.
Of course back in 1965, nobody ""got"" this movie at all and
were terrified by it's raw, racey and unflichingly acted
subject matter that would not even be given a second thought today!
Sal Mineo jumps off the screen in this one and oozes both
sex appeal and menace at the same time!
This movie included some scenes that were firsts for it's time
(the infamous pool scene), the ""tighty-whitey"" scenes, and
those white jeans that looked like they were melted, mixed & poured
onto Sal's diminuitive but very taut physique!
Juliet Prowse and Elaine Strich were both good in
this too, and the lesbianism aspect was very taboo then too.
For 1965, this movie was so far ahead of it's time that it's ridiculous!
Sal Mineo was a bold & forward-thinking man as well as a gifted actor!
May he one day get the recognition he deserves.",1176163200,23,1043,4.326530612244898
2475835,3,B000DZG5R4,"Conversely frenzied with overwrought direction and rendered flatfooted with early sixties naivete, this oddly paced, offbeat psychodrama is nonetheless worth a waltz because of Sal Mineo's jazzy foray as a disco waiter swirling down the drain of sexual schizophrenia.  Passing in and out of his orbit are Juliet Prowse as a repressed wannabe actress, Jan Murray as a widower of a sex-crime victim, and Elaine Stritch as a closet lesbian.  Unfortunately, Prowse gets more chance to prance than Mineo (or does it just seem that way?)  Anyway, it's worth sitting through this feature just see Sal do the jerk!",1167696000,9,606,5.101010101010101
8102998,5,B000DZG5R4,"An excellent cult film that was way ahead of it's time just like it's star, the great Sal Mineo who gives an outstanding performance. Released in 1965, this film breaks all boundaries for it's time. Featuring hints of masturbation, voyerism, pornography, lesbianism, rape, incest and stalking. It's tame by today's standards but shocking enough to have been censored at the time. The film centers around Nora (played by Juliet Prowse) who begins getting obscene calls. At first she disregards them as a prank calls, but soon realizes the caller is very serious. This sadly ignored masterpiece truly deserves a fully uncut blu-ray release.",1467158400,2,638,5.203883495145631

A lot of people seem to dismiss this as a lousy, trashy movie worth seeing only for the shots of gorgeous Sal Mineo in tight pants, tighty-whities, and even nearly nude in tiny speedo briefs.  I actually thought it was a decent psychological thriller, despite a few loose ends.  It's never made clear just who the older woman is who makes love to Sal's character ""Lawrence"" when Lawrence's kid sister happens to peep in, freaks out and falls down the stairs, thus damaging her brain and scarring Lawrence for life. Is that Lawrence and kid sister's mom, or just some random girlfriend, hooker, neighbor lady?  I choose to go with the ""mom"" interpretation since it's the most guilt-inducing and traumatic interpretation, and given that Lawrence grows up to be a peeper, stalker and homicidal sex maniac, he needs all the justification he can get. Similarly, I wasn't clear on whether Lawrence actually rapes Norah in the end, or stops before he actually does the dirty deed (they both stay dressed throughout so it's hard to tell), but figured he probably raped her and the depiction onscreen was as much as the filmmakers were allowed to show and still get it past the censors.

The parts of the movie I enjoyed and admired the most were the very detailed and nuanced parallels between police detective Lt. Dave Madden  (Jan Murray) and Mineo's Lawrence. Both of them
 - are obviously hot for Norah (Juliet Prowse);
 - have a traumatic event in their pasts that affected their sex lives;
 - are the main caregiver to a child at home - Lawrence's damaged sister has the mind of a child;
 - read porn and other perverted books;
 - take an obsessive interest in obscene phone calls - Madden sits around listening to tapes of them in the evenings rather than spend time with his kid or even take her a requested glass of water;
 - creep on Norah in different ways - with Lawrence it's obvious, but Madden also tapes his conversation with Norah on a hidden recorder without telling her, follows her around during at least part of the day, and just happens to be driving by her apartment at weird late hours after he has been sitting around listening to women on tape talking about obscene calls;
 - have the same type of telephone (on their table full of porn books);
 - even wear huge pinky rings, which show up on the hand of the obscene caller, on Lawrence's hand when he's pacing around smoking, and on Madden's hand near the end when he's whacking Lawrence around.

The parallels are so obvious as to lead the viewer down the path of wondering which one is actually the obscene caller - or is it someone else entirely - for much of the film, until the answer is revealed, more or less.  I did wonder if the reason that Madden doesn't arrest Lawrence for rape and murder at the very end, but instead just beats him up and lets him stumble out on the street, is because Madden has realized the parallels between the two.  Of course, it could also be that Madden is just so sick to death of the whole filthy world he didn't bother to make the arrest, and figured he'd make a call and let the officers round the perv up later, which does seem to be what happens since I don't think even NYC cops in the 60s would shoot a guy just for jaywalking in traffic (I could be wrong though).

What I didn't like about the movie: The fact that Norah acts progressively more and more scared to death as the calls get worse and worse, like you'd expect, but then after Marian (Elaine Stritch) is actually killed outside Norah's apartment while wearing Norah's coat - in other words, it's pretty obvious this wasn't just a random creep popping out of a dark alley - Norah gets all blase about the whole thing and is suddenly no longer afraid to go out by herself, go home alone or hang around late at an empty workplace with a guy she barely knows and then walk home afterwards. It doesn't make much sense, unless Norah had somehow decided it was evil lesbian Marian making all the calls in the first place, which seems unlikely given that the calls sound very male.  Or maybe Norah is just so relieved about disposing of her overprotective boss, she figures what else could possibly go wrong?  In any event, the movie jumped the shark a bit for me at that point.  Fortunately, by then it's almost over.

Also kind of annoying that the lesbian character had to be killed off, but it was 1965, I guess.",1424563200,,4406,4.515723270440252

Love the grainy black and white cinematography and the cheesey music and goofy dancing of the era.  Sal Mineo has never been sexier or sadly creepier.  Always trying to push the envelope, seeing that that sexual revolution was about to explode,  he was always good in anything he did from the time he was about thirteen.  Sadly his honesty worked against him in socially paranoid hollywood where he refused to conform to peer pressure and stay in the closet like the other sad gay actors of the same time period",1391904000,2,655,4.7105263157894735
