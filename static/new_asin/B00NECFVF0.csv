8677586,4,B00NECFVF0,"It's an interesting reworking of the story I'm familiar with, and the unfamiliar parts of the plot weren't so jarring that they ruined anything for me. I'm curious if the LN is radically different than the manga/anime or if the writers of this movie just took some liberties with their interpretation.
 Although I did enjoy this movie, I really have to point out some issues I had with it. The English subtitles were pretty terrible, even to the point of being humorous. In some cases, it was poor grammar, while others it was more a matter of choosing the wrong translation of certain japanese words. The acting was... well... about what you'd expect I guess. The video quality was poor. I really didn't like the casting although I haven't personally read the LNs so maybe the visuals I'm comparing them to are less true to the source. The attempt at ""male gaze"" shots was pretty bad, too. The idea itself doesn't bother me, more so the execution. It was it too awkward to be erotic, while not being absurd enough to be humorous in most cases. I mean, I laughed. Not because I was supposed to, but because of the magnitude of fail at some points.
 I really did laugh a lot though, so overall I don't regret my purchase at all. I felt inclined to give a poor rating because the quality of the movie is objectively terrible, I think. Perhaps in Japan this is the equivalent of a Hollywood film, but as an American, I feel like a couple of motivated teenagers with smartphones and a computer could've produced a more polished final product.
 I liked it, though. If none of the stuff I mentioned bothers you, and you enjoy the show, you'll probably like it too.",1423699200,,1658,4.538461538461538
