8685675,4,B00OZ2YCOE,"This is a series which could have easily been made for kids and adults.  The humor is real and often goofy, and based upon the traits of the characters.  Unfortunately, there is a dropping of F-bombs throughout (and the irreverent use of the words ""God"" and ""Jesus Christ"").  And you never know.  One episode was devoid of them; another had a half-dozen.

Because of the mixture of ages in this show, it works for the same ages at home.  For if you don't want to expose your child to vulgar language, then you need to bypass this show (Australia has warning labels on them, and personally, I would add 2 years to the minimum age listed).

For me, one of the biggest problems of Aussie shows is language (bad language; not their accents).  But, speaking of that, I believe this is subtitled.

This show can be found elsewhere; I think only in region 4, which means you need a region-free DVD player.",1500076800,,898,4.493827160493828
