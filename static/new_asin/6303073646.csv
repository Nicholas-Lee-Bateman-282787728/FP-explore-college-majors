7836321,5,6303073646,"If you are a coach fan you have to get this video. I know VHS is outdated technology, but I have it on DVD also. This is like a best of for a fantastic show that will have you laughing your head off.",1368316800,,199,3.6511627906976742
7836322,1,6303073646,"Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but I just didn't find this show believable. There is no Minnesota State and there isn't an NFL team called the Breakers. If you can't get the facts straight in the beginning how do you expect to win a viewers trust as the show moves on. And Jerry Van Dyke as a football coach? Was Don Knotts not available?",1137456000,,351,4.333333333333333
7836323,5,6303073646,This show was great and I would love to buy the series on DVD.  I'll even buy the episodes when Hayden moves to FL to coach the Breakers!,1122336000,7,137,3.892857142857143

7836328,5,6303073646,"This is a wonderful tape showing many of the greatest clips from the seasons of Coach. This tape did a really great job of interviewing all of the cast members of this show. Coach is my all time favorite show and I really want the sesaons to get released on dvd, when is this going to happen. The cast members which include Graig T. Nelson, Shelley Fabares, Clare Carey, and Bill Faberbake are wonderful. I encourage this show to anyone who has a sense of humor. Please release the complete season on dvd.",1093564800,7,505,4.440860215053763
7836329,4,6303073646,"The first part of the tape could be better. I thought the Mary Hart interview was pretty hokey back when it was broadcast. Also, they left out some of the funniest highlights of the series.
The ""bloopers"" and outtakes are hilarious though and make this tape worth buying. What I'd really like to see is this wonderful TV series in a DVD box set!",1028332800,10,345,4.40625
