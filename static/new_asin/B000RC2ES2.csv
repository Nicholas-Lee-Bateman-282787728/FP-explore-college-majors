2863991,5,B000RC2ES2,"entourage is truly a awesome show, if you are a sex and the city fan you will love this show! The characters are so realistic and Jeremy Piven brings something to this show,it would not be the same without him. I think it is well worth the money. Once you start watching you will crave more!",1190160000,5,291,4.214285714285714
2863992,1,B000RC2ES2,"it used to amaze me years ago when a company called 'ronco' used to advertize junk on tv and millions of americans would buy it.
i'm not amazed anymore, more like disappointed, because mediocrity
seems to be what most americans want everyday.
calling ""entourage"" mediocre is probably being too nice. this is a
low-quality series with pathetic acting being watched by a ""clockwork orange"" audience. (you know when they had to prop alex's eyes open so he had to watch the unwatchable.)
after really lowering the bar with ""sex and the city,"" hbo has put it underground with this tripe.
hbo used to be an excellent alternative to network(mediocre) tv with series like ""six-feet under"", ""oz"", ""carnivale"". these were well-written,well-acted programs that were a pleasure to watch and would also challenge one's intelligence.
hbo hasn't reached ground zero yet; they still have ""the wire""
""curb your enthusiasm"" and ""big love.""
note to hbo: don't look back, showtime with ""brotherhood"", ""dexter""
and ""weeds"" is catching up and perhaps pulling ahead.
dragging dead weight like ""entourage"" can only slow you down.",1190073600,8,1105,5.17877094972067

Excellent scripting, dialogue, cinematography, etc. No slut-shaming--big plus. It's taken for granted that women like sex too. But the foul language was a bit heavy, and annoying to constantly see only 20-something models populating nearly every scene.

2864033,3,B000RC2ES2,"I won't give anything away about our boys but nothing really mindblowing happens in this half a season. Splitting the DVD set into two was a dumb idea for fans of this show. Can you say ""marketing""?

The extras are so-so although the lengthy cast and director/producer sitdown Q&A reveal a lot but they do seem obsessed with location shooting. As someone who does not live in LA, I could care less how accurate the settings are. Who really cares they are shooting scenes at an actual restaurant or bar the Hollywood glitterati hang out at? It means zip to myself.

I do like the scenes at Laker games or at concerts but as far as the rest, they could shoot on the moon for all I care, as it's the relationships between the four guys that drives this show not the locations.

I'll be honest, the series better pick up in Season Four as the only decent storylines are Turtle possibly gaining an actual girlfriend and Ari and Lloyd having a nice moment in one outstanding episode.

Plus I still don't get Vince as a sex symbol. The guy looks wimpy and is not even remotely cute (this taken from a straw poll of ten female co-workers) and even in this series Adrian Grenier still can't act his way out of a plastic bag (re., check his IMDB list of credits).

Watchable but total fluff really.",1326672000,,1288,4.417721518987341

A few weeks ago I got every season of this show from my local libraries and watched them in order during a very funny week. Without a doubt I enjoyed season three the most, mainly due to Piven's great story line, and Dillon's constant wry hilarity. This is also the season where Ari's assistant Lloyd comes into his own, and he does it very humorously. The writing is strong throughout, the cast thoroughly tight with their comic timing, and in general I laughed my ass off frequently.

While not the funniest tv show ever, it's certainly one of the best of the last decade, and this is one season I'll gladly rewatch in the years to come when I need some good humor.",1262390400,,678,4.416

2864045,5,B000RC2ES2,"Interesting for a show that follows the entourage of a Hollywood actor, and makes much of the dichotomy between ""the artists"" (who lean towards prestige projects with actual acting, writing, etc.) and ""the suits"" (who ALWAYS have an eye on the money-making potential of a project) that HBO decided to break this admittedly SLIGHTLY longer season into two pieces - and charge the same for this 8 episode set as for the other 12 episode sets.  The show that glorifies the artist and derides the suits is presented here in a COMPLETELY ""suit"" decision.  Sad.

Do you feel a little jerked around?  I do.

This is not at all an indictment on these 8 delicious episodes.  Vinny has a professional breakup with Ari, but Ari still hovers just over Vince's horizon, trying to woo him back.  Johnny Drama's show ""Five Towns"" debuts and the wonderful insecure bravado almost melts down when the reviews start.  In one wonderful episode Drama is the targeted for a ""Punk'd"" type show hosted by Pauly Shore. After stealing a parking spot from UFC Champion Chuck Liddell Johnny is convinced that the professional brawler will be coming for revenge.  They go home and tee up UFC footage - showing Liddell pounding another professional into smithereens.  It is really a tribute to Kevin Dillon's acting ability that I simultaneously felt  sympathy for Drama and was laughing my head off as he whimpered to his buds ""sweet, merciful Jesus"", imagining Liddell doing some similar damage to his insecure face.

Vince has a new agent, played by Carla Gugino, after firing Ari, and the tension between the three of them is palpable.  There are several excellent Ari moments - such as Ari's sudden acquisition of a little humanity making him unable to fire an agent who is losing money.  Ari's shrink tries telling him that his new compassion is a GOOD thing, but he is desperate to get his ""edge"" back.  Another brilliant episode has Ari and another of his Jewish clients (Nick Rubenstein, played in matching apoplectic fashion by Adam Goldberg) trying to close a deal on Yom Kippor - while surrounded by their families and other worshipers who think that doing business, using any transportation other than foot, even using a phone, is a sin against God.  Ari has never been more torn.

Turtle gets a hot romantic interest - the daughter of the custom car shop where he has Drama's cruiser fixed up.  Eric is mainly a sidekick to Vince, although in one humorous episode he is hoping for a weekend retreat to Napa with girlfriend Sloan.  He gets his wish, but as the saying goes - be careful what you wish for...

So - 8 excellent episodes of a superb series - with you the viewer jerked around by exactly the kind of people the creative artists of this series despise.  Ironic, huh?",1253664000,,2761,4.7343096234309625
2864046,4,B000RC2ES2,A friend recommended the series and I put the first season on netflix. It only took 3 episodes before I returned it to netflix and bought the first two seasons. It's been loads of fun watching their antics and this season continues the fun.,1252886400,,240,4.4772727272727275
2864047,4,B000RC2ES2,"I've been eating up the ENTOURAGE shows and have watched the entire first five seasons in about two weeks.

But I think I hit my first moment in the series where I didn't believe it in a second.

When Vince meets with the Saudi prince for financing for his dream project, MEDELLIN, he's expected to have sex with the prince's wife.  For the wife, it's a given.  For the husband, he demands it to keep her happy.  And Vince bails.  Why did this ring false to me?  Because Vince has had sex with EVERYONE in Hollywood, from his co-stars to the girls hanging out in Starbucks to a cashier in a Barnes & Noble to his new agent.  Plus, he even tells Eric that he has a ""thing"" for Eastern European women--which the Saudi prince's wife is the stereotype.

The Pablo Escobar project means everything to Vince.  He's willing to sacrifice his career, his finances, even Ari to get his hands on it.  And he can't ""act"" like he's enjoying the hot Eastern European wife of a nut who's offering more than double the budget for the movie?

Maybe I'm reading too far into the show...but my point is that it's a great enough show to pay this kind of attention to.

The scenes of Ari and Lloyd are worth it alone.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched the highlights online.",1252713600,,1265,4.35042735042735

Because that is how I grew up and it is so incredibly done that it transports you back to your high school, college and first working days.  Admittedly, women might not get it (my wife thinks I'm a dolt for watching it), but this is a show for guys of all ages.

The writing is superb and the acting is just as good.  It is a very fast 30 minutes with each segment leaving you hungry for more.

If you haven't watched this series, pick up Season 1 and sit down to an unbelievably funny and crafty show.  My hat is off to HBO on this one.",1241654400,,835,4.301282051282051

2864065,5,B000RC2ES2,"I didn't start watching Entourage until the 3rd season on HBO, but I have gone back to purchase all the seasons on DVD and have thoroughly enjoyed them!  There is drama, action, suspense and a lot of laughs.  I think the show has a wide audience appeal.  My wife has enjoyed watching them and is looking forward to the 4th season being released so that she can watch the shows in order.",1197331200,2,386,4.333333333333333
2864066,1,B000RC2ES2,"I really wish I could offer a review of this product but since I have yet to receive it, eventhough you took payment for it exactly one month ago today, I am not able to offer an opinion.

The payment was deducted promptly, the tracking number came prompty, ....and the tracking number goes no where, I only received a response to the first email I sent, after 16 days had gone by, telling me to wait 7 more.  I thought, surely someone just made an error getting it out and they are sending it now....WRONG!!!!  No one will respond to any other emails I have sent demanding my product or my money refunded.  Quite frankly, I am suprised I am being sent an opportunity to submit a review since at this point I am not only being ignored as a consumer, I also have been stolen from as the money was processed and I have NEVER REVECIVED THE PRODUCT!!!!

Someone should really check into your customer service skills!

2864067,1,B000RC2ES2,"Why does HBO consistently decide to jerk their fans?  Almost $80 for a ""complete"" season of this show!  And the same amount for ""THE SOPRANOS"", ""ROME"", and ""DEADWOOD"".  Sure they're great shows, but come on ... Showtime sells WEEDS and DEXTER in the $20-$30 range and NBC gives us an entire 24-episode season of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS for just $19.95!",1194134400,33,348,4.766666666666667
2864068,4,B000RC2ES2,"Unfortunately, Entourage is starting to sell out for the money only putting 8 episodes in this collection. HOwever, if your a big entourage fan you can't just skip owning this season. On the other hand its good to see they didn't cut Ari out completely and Drama is still at his best. What else can I say except its still Entourage!!!",1193961600,,334,4.491803278688525

2864070,4,B000RC2ES2,Selling season 3 in 2 parts is really biting the hand that feeds you. I absolutely loved parts 1 & 2 but spending 30 bucks for 8 episodes (the length of part 2) hurts my frugal nature!,1193702400,25,184,4.0
2864071,5,B000RC2ES2,"if HBO isn't in fact like traditional TV, this is not your common HBO series, i haven't found so many great aspects brought together in a single theme, from chapter one till now this is great and just gets better, i hardly can wait for the next season",1193702400,,251,4.25
2864072,4,B000RC2ES2,"First off, I'm just bitter about the part 2 hiatus. I don't know why it took so long for season 3, part 2 to come out but it was worth the wait. Entourage hits it off with Ari returning to the good guys after some Ari-antics. Definitaly worth the wait (although they were testing my patience) and I'm already waiting for season four to come out.",1193702400,,345,4.242424242424242

2864074,4,B000RC2ES2,"The boys are back at it and provide plenty of laughs. Drama continues to be my favorite character in the series, while ""E"" needs to be taken out back and beaten.

looking forward to next season.",1191888000,4,194,4.388888888888889
2864075,4,B000RC2ES2,"Entourage is a great show and the only reason they are spliting the dvd's up is because the season was split up. It's so worth it because its the conclusion to the best season of the show thus far, season 4 was so so just for the record. Season 3 part two is a fantastic conclusion to a cliffhanger midpoint. I'm glad it's on DVD and I cannot wait to watch it. What I am hoping is that the next season will pull this show out of last seasons funk.",1191283200,4,447,3.977777777777778

I ordered one copy and it was defective, got a replacement, same problem.  I'm just glad I'm paranoid enough to watch them as soon as I get them just in case this happens.  I love the show but this is really annoying to have to deal with.  So far I'm on season 4 and this part 2 of season 3 is the only one to give me trouble.",1517529600,,500,4.11340206185567
