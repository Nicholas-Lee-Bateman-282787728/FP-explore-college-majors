8349634,1,B000A59Q9Q,"don't waste your money on this dvd, this is my second bad experience with v.i.e.w. dvd's the other was airto and flora purmin, it was better but also had bad sound quality,was to short, and boaring except for 5 minutes of flora singing towards the end.  I also understand that the louie bellson, and the ron carter, art farmer dvd's aren't so great either.  These happen to be two other dvds that I might have been interested in.  The Latin Nights is very dull, uninspired, poor sound quality, I didn't even make it through one watching, it is that bad, and I am a big fan of Latin music, I bought my dvd at circuit city for $11.99, I think tito puente is put on the cover only as a draw, because he only performed about 2-3 mintues at the very end, and it wasen't very good either. I don't think I will be buying anymore v.i.e.w. dvds.  I called circuit city and told them I thought it was a poor dvd, they said, to bad. I called v.i.e.w. and told them it was a poor dvd, after trying to sell me other dvd's and cd's he offered me $10 off on my next purchase at their site, which is still to much because at their site their dvd's are $20 plus shipping",1161734400,8,1153,4.15695067264574
