6167388,5,B00HKK0MXI,"This was the perfect yoga DVD for me. I'm one of those people who was torn between doing my yoga and going to the gym and what I love about the Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVD's is that they are the best of both worlds, this one especially! The first part consists of some warm-ups and poses which are held with deep breathing. These are strengthening for both the upper and lower body. Then there is some really great ab work followed by an easy to do floor cardio routine. There is also relaxation and meditation. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get the deep strengthening and calming of yoga with the benefits of more active exercise. When I think about it, this is really a genius presentation!",1300147200,4,701,4.358778625954199
6167389,4,B00HKK0MXI,"I have and love doing RaviAna's Fat Free Yoga DVD. When I first saw the poses in this new workout, I was a little intimidated, but once you actually try the poses, they're doable, even if you have to do the modified version (as I did for quite a few of them). My only hope is that your floor is somewhat soft, because some of my joints hurt doing this on my hardwood floor (and I'm in my twenties...)!
My only gripe with this DVD is the scenery in the background is a little too fake for my eyes and is also distracting.
However, Ana's smiling face is lovely as usual and the music is enjoyable (some of the tunes definitely borrowed from Bollywood, might I add!). I also like how they show side and front views of Ana as she does the poses for a better idea of how to position your body.
The cardio aspect is not too strenuous (like you would get in an aerobics class at your local gym) but I did break a sweat and I definitely felt my muscles working.",1300060800,20,953,4.129032258064516
6167390,5,B00HKK0MXI,"This is the only style of yoga I do because its the one that gives me real results. Kundalini Yoga can seem pretty odd if you are new but from my research, I have come to realize that this is the most ancient form of yoga there is. It seems to have in addition to familiar yoga forms elements  of calisthenics and aerobics. It is very active and physical and somewhat challenging but at the same time it is accessible to the masses. As they say ""...if you can breathe you can do it!"" The important thing is it works! Your life will definitely change as a result of Ana & Ravi's practices. Mind did, in more ways then I can list, because overall this is more than just exercise, its a complete body/mind/soul overhaul.
The main sets are Nerves of Platinum and the Body Bliss. I felt stronger immediately followingthe first time through. I guess my nerves needed toughing up! I enjoyed the Body Bliss set immensely even though it was a challenge. I kept up and indeed, felt the bliss! I am looking forward to the challenge of their new Yoga Bootcamp!",1300060800,5,1048,4.402061855670103
6167391,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I did this again today and I feel awesome! The Body Bliss set is so amazing I think I am becoming addicted to it! It gets me in the zone big time!!! I really break a sweat (nothing like a good yoga sweat!). It feels tough, then it feels like I can go on forever, then its tough again, and then effortless, than tough then - another breakthrough and bliss! It's bringing out my inner athlete lol! Full cardio session on the floor! Why didn't anyone ever think of this before! Thank you Ravi and Ana for bringing one of the lesser known but very amzing Kundalini Yoga sets to us! As someone said in one of the reviews below (or somewhere else), there are so many valuable Kundalini Yoga sets that you could literally do a different one every day for at least a year and never repeat and all lead to the same place - BLISS - by a different route!

I have been doing Ana & Ravis DVDs for some time now. They get better and better. The music on Body Electric is awesome. The Mantra chant delicious.",1300060800,5,993,4.198952879581152
6167392,5,B00HKK0MXI,I did the BODY ELECTRIC 2day!! OMG! ANA! You KICKED MY BUTT in a good way! Sweat Popping off with all flying colors LOL! I love the NARAYAN HARI CHANT!! I love the music!!! You ever thought about putting your CHANT SONGS on ITUNES as MP3 downloads??? I wish you could because its nice! (SUN~YA),1299974400,7,294,4.363636363636363
6167393,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Beautiful!  I just finished doing this dvd and I absolutely loved it!

I was looking for something challenging, true to Kundalini yoga, with good fun and engaging sequences and meditation, etc. and this is it!

The Body Bliss Segment is a fun Kriya that is also delightfully challenging! I mean, power to you if you make it through the whole way the first few times! You may have to stop and start and Ana & Ravi give you that concession if necessary, of course all the while they are encouraging you to do your best. This set actually gives you a great cardio workout even though you are on the floor the whole time - talk about no-impact aerobics - genius! This set is to ""Master your Domain"" or, to make life suck less. Whatever! It works and it feels great! I loved every challenging minute!",1299974400,4,795,4.431506849315069
6167394,2,B00HKK0MXI,"I am a huge fan of Ana Brett and Ravi's older videos (basically anything where her hair is brown, not blonde).  I credit Ana and Ravi for starting me on the wonderful path of yoga 3 years ago.  Yoga has changed my life in so many positive ways and I've never looked back.  However, I am not a fan of their newer videos, this one included.  I must say, the workout is challenging (although very repetitive), and I was sore the next day. But this is not yoga, and having ""Kundalini Yoga"" on the cover is misleading.  This is more like a loose interpretation (note LOOSE) of some basic yoga poses made into some kind of strange techno aerobic exercise video.  I found the scenery and music very distracting, and the majority of the ""poses"" very untraditional-like they were made up by Ravi/Ana.  I love yoga because it is a beautiful combination of strength and calmness, and this video is the opposite of calming.

If you want a challenging YOGA workout, I would suggest Shivea Rea's Daily Energy or Fluid Power.  These videos are beautifully shot with soothing music, but the workout is intense.  And Shivea Rea does actual traditional yoga.  Or, if you enjoy Ana Brett (as I do), try any of her older videos (think: brown hair Ana), like Navel Power, Warrior Workout, Fat Free Yoga, or Ultimate Stretch.

I will not be purchasing any more Ana/Ravi videos.",1299888000,32,1355,4.6
6167395,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Many of the postures in this DVD are long and broad. As the theme is about energy, I imagine the large amount of space so many postures take up reaches into the auric field. There is lots of back and forth movement, arousing the energy body.

One of the musical tracks made me laugh -- a bluegrass version a Hindu mantra. I admire Ravi and Ana's ability to juxtapose things.

This has always been apparent in their approach to kundalini yoga, as they infuse it with aspects of other yogic traditions. I particularly enjoyed side arm balance, for example, in this DVD. It's a posture I haven't done since I started kundalini yoga, and realized those muscles benefited from being reactivated.

Similarly, all the kundalini yoga meditations that I've done to this point, have been attached to a mantra. But the first meditation in this DVD continued with the gong sound that began in the relaxation that preceded it. One begins this meditation in a peaceful, silent, expanded state and is already ""out there"" without having to work at quieting the mind or occupying it with a mantra to chant. What follows is a more traditional kundalini mantra meditation.

I like this DVD. Not too strenuous, but interesting, leaving me totally relaxed.",1299283200,8,1235,4.811320754716981
6167396,5,B00HKK0MXI,"After doing The Body Electric Workout, I could probably light my house(even the whole neighborhood!) with my own internal electricity! :) I did the entire DVD straight through. It starts out with traditional warm-ups, so I thought it would be pretty mellow. But, it progresses along, getting a little more challenging with each segment...culminating with the Body Bliss segment.(see below description for details) I really feel charged and ""in tune"" after doing this workout. I can feel it working on my nerves for sure. Whenever I have a hard day and my nerves feel raw, I can tell this DVD will strengthen them...I guess that's why they used the Nerves of Platinum description. I highly recommend this DVD and their other new one, Boot Camp. I can't get enough of these two right now. In this DVD, you'll recognize Ana's red RELAX shirt and her pink Speedo top that she wore in one of her Facebook photos, I believe. The music is a blend of styles. There is almost a folksy twang in a couple of them and like an Indian hip-hop in some. They all invoke a feeling of well-being, joy, and are definitely feel-good songs! (The one in the Body Bliss segment has an intense enough edge added to it to help give you the determination to keep going.) The background is the same mountain one as in the previous DVDs.
Kundalini yoga is so great for your body, inside and out. I've been doing Raviana's yoga for years and it has given me amazing gains physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Also, many people I know have found it helpful for anxiety, OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), excess weight, and health problems in general. I took a short break from Kundalini Yoga recently, and found it harder to stay as lean(I gained 5 pounds, which doesn't sound like a lot, but I'm used to my ideal weight)and had more anxiety. So, now I'm back on track! Ever since I started Kundalini Yoga several years ago, I've been nice and lean without even really trying...just doing Kundalini yoga, eating right, and dancing. I'm only adding this to encourage people that you don't have to beat your brains out at the gym trying to get to your healthy weight. Kundalini gets everything covered in a minimal amount of time by working on the inside to the outer.
Anyway, back to the DVD!
Here is a break-down of the segments:
INTRO: 1:08-
Overview of the DVD
TUNE-IN: 2:06-
the usual Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo, but with different background sounds from their previous DVDs
WARM-UPS: 9:20-
Starts seated, with spinal grinds. Next, sitting on heels, flexing the spine forward and back. Then, doing a side stretch sitting on your heels, repeatedly stretching over side to side. Then, sitting cross-legged, arms behind head, twisting with Breath of Fire(rapid breathing through nose). Next, wide-legged rowboat(sitting wide-legged, arms folded bringing them down, then bringing legs together and sitting up). Then, wide-legged forward bend.
NERVES OF PLATINUM PART 1: 11:00-
Start standing, fingers interlaced at the base of your spine, exhaling bending forward and inhaling back up. Then, horse stance(standing, legs wide, feet out-turned, knees bent) with arms parallel, palms facing out. Next, wide-legged standing forward bend twisting from side-to-side with alternate arms raising. Then, holding a wide-legged forward bend. Next, laying on your stomach in locust pose(legs raised). You do this twice. Then, you raise up on your elbows, hands in fists by your ears, and on your toes. You raise one leg and hold with long deep breathing. Challenging core pose! Then Stretch Pose(lying on your back, head and shoulders raised, hands underneath your hips, legs raised), with long deep breathing.
NERVES OF PLATINUM PART 2: 10:00-
You begin in the up position of a push-up, but with the tops of your feet on the floor. Then, back platform pose...hands behind you, body raised, legs straight, only your feet and hands touching the floor. Next, side plank pose. Then, seated cross-legged, with your thumbs and ring fingers meeting, arms 30 degrees parallel to the floor, outstretched in front of you...you stare straight ahead with long deep breathing...Ravi Mudra I believe they called it...this exercise is said to be good for the adrenals.
BODY BLISS WORKOUT: 22:30-
You start with an ab crunch...balancing on your sacrum, knees bent, pulsing your upper body side to side. Next, V Pose...balancing on your sacrum, legs straight, with Breath of Fire. Next, lying on your back, double leg lifts with Breath of Fire through puckered lips. Then, on your hands and knees doing alternate legs lifts behind you with Breath of Fire through puckered lips again.(This is done for quite awhile...challenging!) THEN, you repeat this exercise, but with alternating raising your arms in addition to the legs. This is done for quite awhile again.  Next, now that your glutes are about to fall off, you stand up and do squats with arms outstrethed in front of you. You'll want to yell at Ravi(my Raviana yoga friends and I always joke about yelling at Ravi for working us so hard, but that's one of the things we love him for!)(When we heard about the new Boot Camp DVD, we joked that we were scared of what Ravi would have in store for us! LOL)...I love that they challenge you. True gurus bring out the best in their students and help you to realize your full potential. Next, you sit on your heels, arms up and raise and lower them to parallel, moving the palms; palms up and palms down as you raise and lower your arms.
DEEP RELAXATION: 4:00-
A good relaxation with Ravi's wonderful words and gong!
3 MINUTE MEDITATION: 3:00-
A seated meditation with the gong. You sit quietly, cross-legged, with your hands upturned on your knees, thumbs and index fingers meeting.
MANTRA CHANT: 5:30-
Seated cross-legged, hands on your sternum, you chant ""Narayan Hari""
CLOSING PRAYER: 1:20-
Traditional closing prayer and Sat Nam.
(after this is Ana doing a short little fun dance...same as the one on the Boot Camp DVD)
BREATH PRIMER: 3:30-
Breath explanation and demonstration of Long Deep Breathing and Breath of Fire. Same primer as on their previous set of DVDs...the one with Ana in a purple top and shorts and her hair in a long pony-tail.
RENEW YOU, THROUGH AND THROUGH: 5:25-
Seated cross-legged, arms outstretched in front of you, parallel to the floor...one hand in fist, the other hand over it, both thumbs up side by side. You hold your breath out as long as you can, inhale, and repeat.

Here are the PRE-SET workouts the DVD comes with. Each one is a combination of the above exercises:
ALL-IN-ONE-MINI-WORKOUT: 40:00
NEW NERVES: 49:00
TOTAL BLISS: 50:00

6167399,5,B00HKK0MXI,Super fun! I love how balanced and invigorated I feel after doing this DVD. Great one for women to balance hormones around that time of the month. Ana's vibrant spirit is infectious! This DVD offered a nice dose of calming seated poses as well as energizing light cardio. I literally can feel myself vibrating all over when I finish this DVD. All of Ana and Ravi's dvd's are like natural anti-depressants and they keep you buzzing all day long. I've never looked forward to doing a workout DVD the way I do with Ana and Ravi.,1448668800,2,525,4.479166666666667

6167404,4,B00HKK0MXI,I own several of the couple's DVDs.  There is a very long leg lift section that I feel is too long and doesn't really do a whole lot.  I wish that this segment were shorter and something else was incorporated but the first section  is spot on.,1430006400,,243,4.127659574468085

6167406,1,B00HKK0MXI,"It's so annoying.  You move your  legs up and down for about 5 minutes, which is soooo boring, then you do it again but this time lifting alternating arms.  BORING.",1427414400,,164,4.4
6167407,4,B00HKK0MXI,"Very well done. Love the breathing and the ""exercising from inside out"". I like the selection of poses and I just do the best I can when it gets too hard for my 68 year old knees and joints. But the more I do it, the more limber I become. I use these videos in a rotation with some of my own yoga moves, stretching and balance exercises too. Also some Sit & Be Fit to give me a real variety. But the Kundalini Yoga is great and my most frequent practice. I like the way they explain the poses' effects on the body and how it helps your thyroid, liver,  etc.",1422835200,10,557,3.9732142857142856

6167419,5,B00HKK0MXI,"There is something magical about Ravi Ana's workouts.  It must be all that breathing and movement.  This latest workout doesn't disappoint.  I find this workout especially therapeutic if I am feeling tired or out of sorts.  I feel so wonderful and energized after I finish!

You can also design your own workout using the matrix option.

Why I love this workout:

* Even though you aren't pounding your body with high impact, you feel so energized.

* I am becoming more comfortable in my body. The first few times I did the shake dance, I felt like a total dork.  But eventually, I just focused on the movements and sensations and lost myself in the dance.  I felt so refreshed afterwards!

* The clean white set.  I didn't care for the fake looking scenery in the earlier workouts.  I much prefer this type of set since it is not distracting.  Ana's yoga mat is a pretty yellow one, with butterflies on it.

* The upbeat music.  It didn't really sound like ""yoga music"" to me, but it fit the happy, peppy vibe of the workout.

* The fun new exercises.  I especially liked the two where you are lying on your back, with one leg extended straight up, while moving your arms up and down.  I love Ana's analogy of being a beautiful and graceful animal while peddling your feet in down dog.  Okay, so I'm sure I don't look anything at all like a graceful animal in this pose, but it's fun to visualize.  Picture all of your bones dancing, as Ana says.

* The graceful movements.  It seems the movements were really flowing in this workout.  I felt very smooth and coordinated while in horse stance and moving my arms in small circles.  I also love the curtsy moves.

The only thing I didn't like about this workout is that the transitions between sections were sloppy.  For a moment the DVD would ""freeze,"" the music would stop and then you would proceed to the next section.  This is sloppy editing and shouldn't happen.

If you are a fan of Ravi and Ana, you should try this workout.  If you are new to Kundalini yoga, you would also enjoy this workout.",1406937600,8,2386,4.541176470588235

6167421,2,B00HKK0MXI,"I have problems with my hormones and through I would give this a try. This was a joke. the breathing out loud parts made me feel like an idiot. I have done yogi before, but this dvd was not for me. Some others may love it, just was not my cup of tea",1403308800,3,249,3.7169811320754715
6167422,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I purchased 8 of Ana Brett & Ravi's Kundalini DVD's so far, with plans of purchasing more of them.  I love each and every one of them!  Each one has something different to offer in one way or another.  I rotate them so never get tired of the same old routine.  I feel happier when I practice Kundalini yoga, and am more physically fit.  I am a better person because of Kundalini yoga.  I love the music, instruction, & chanting as well.  Ana is very positive and uplifting as well as an excellent teacher.  Ravi is awesome in his instruction as well.

6167425,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Absolutely LOVE this DVD.

If you read my reviews, you know I am a big Ravi/Ana fan.  I have 19 DVD's counting this one.  This is my latest favorite!!

I got this in the mail and just watched it first.  The sets ""look"" deceptively simple, but once you lay on the floor on your stomach  and kick your heels to your butt for a minute or two, you'll see what I mean...it looked simple..not.

I was very perplexed by the complaints in the negative reviews.  Everything that they didn't like I liked.  I read the reviews before buying this DVD and expected terrible singing, bad music. overly sexy clothes and extremely repetitive and boring exercises...no, no, no, no and no!

I so enjoyed the music and Ana's singing voice is so soothing and peaceful.  The tone is right on for the DVD.

I think Ana dresses appropriately for this DVD.  I'm fact, I think she wears more clothing  in this DVD than the others, but I don't practice with my eyes open, so I don't focus on her looks.

I couldn't be happier with the practice and mantras. I sometimes practice Iyengar yoga, which is a bit more static, but found that Kundalini fits my style more.  I like to dance, ride motorcycles, hike and this type of moving yoga is more my style.  If it's not your style that's fine.  It's not wrong or bad...maybe just not for you right now.  I find myself going through phases and sometimes I may ""need"" a vinyasa flow or a Iyengar practice...

This is truly a feel good DVD...Happy Hormones is the right title...Thank you again Ravi and Ana for such a wonderful, thoughtful practice.",1397952000,4,1566,4.46643109540636
6167426,4,B00HKK0MXI,I just started an exercise program with Kundalini yoga. Ana Brett & Ravi Singh Kundalini Yoga DVDs are fun and easy to follow.,1397779200,,126,4.521739130434782
6167427,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Oh my. Thank you so much, Anna and Ravi. I have about 8 of their DVDs currently and another kundalini dvd. This has taken over from Navel Power and another as my favourite. My inner child adores it. It is sooooo much fun. It is releasing and freeing blocks on a deep level and I have had to check the clock two days running doing the workout because it felt like only 10 minutes had passed where it is such fun. I love that there are two choices of warm up too. Choosing the second one is such a lovely treat for me as done the first one for the last five years on the other dvds. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",1397779200,6,613,3.991869918699187
6167428,5,B00HKK0MXI,"So.... I knew I was feeling on top of the world after I did this workout three days in a row (I only did the 20 minute Body Bliss workout) BUT, random people - all over - co-workers, friends and even strangers would comment on how I am just ""glowing""...seriously - I don't know how doing a bunch of leg and arm lifts can have such an affect - but, after doing this workout I feel my whole body buzzing and so many people commenting cannot be wrong.  I now do this workout (still only the 20 minute Body Bliss) before I am going to party or just want to be noticed - and also when I just want to feel really, really good... it is that AWESOME!!!

I have all of Ravi and Ana's DVDs and rotate them pretty much on a daily basis.  I especially love the fact that most of their dvd's contain shorter sets (many are 10 minutes only) but, still extremely effective.  Keep up the good work - your DVDs are phenomenal and work (quickly!!).",1397520000,6,930,4.15

Great instruction, Demonstration of poses, Music, Love the chants, yoga postures, and breath work! Great for the health of my body, mind, and spirit! I am grateful that these teachings are available for home use!",1395878400,3,353,4.53125
6167431,1,B00HKK0MXI,Not as good as it was promoted. The previous Journey Through chakra was much better. I felt it was wasting my money & Disappointed.,1395619200,3,131,4.5
6167432,5,B00HKK0MXI,Ana and Ravi have really outdone themselves with this fun and effective workout. They are so down to earth yet inspiring and the music and flow of this is awesome. They're really tuned into what their fans are looking for. I'm in my late 40's and this was tailor made for me.,1395273600,,275,4.3076923076923075
6167433,4,B00HKK0MXI,"This DVD is good, but it is not very physically challenging for me. For the most part it is a pleasant workout (with the exception of the shake dance, with I think is ridiculous, so I skip that part). Also some of Ana cueing  is really corny.

But these are small things that I can easily look over, and I would recommend adding this DVD to your collection for days when you want an easy workout.",1394928000,3,396,4.197368421052632
6167434,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I found this dvd in perfect timing to help me recover from a difficult surgery for endometriosis.  My hormones were crashing and migraines were making me very sick.  I have other yoga dvds including several of Ana&Ravi's but did not feel well enough to do them.
This set of exercises is easy to do with modifications at first, then the intensity can be increased.  I couldn't do much of the leg lifts or cobra on belly poses at first, but now I can do the entire dvd feeling terrific the entire time.  The breathing exercises have helped diminish my headaches, hot flashes and anxieties.  I am very grateful for this therapeutic practice.  Thanks so much Ana and Ravi!",1394150400,18,668,4.61864406779661
6167435,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I have all of Ana and Ravi's DVDs and when I first went on-line some of the reviews for this one were ""meh"" so I dawdled doing the whole thing.  I think this is one of their best, actually! It includes some fresh moves with a dance-like feel that is a great addition to the usual kriyas.  The warm ups include the grinds, flexes and twists as usual but has delicious long sciatic stretches.  The Happy Hormones sets cover good physical bases (ab and core work) and some new fun lunges, and horse-stance squats.  I especially love the fluidity of the undulating cobra and horse.  The shake dance is awesome for your lymph system and relieving tension.  The mantra chant is beautiful and calming.  I felt fantastic after doing this DVD - so relaxed, peaceful and refreshed that it moved me to write a review ASAP.  I'm glad that the negative reviews are getting fewer and farther between because this is not one to miss.  I love that I really feel like I get a bodily workout, meditation and focus for my mind, spiritual uplift, and deep relaxation all in one. ***UPDATE*** - I wrote this review after doing the DVD for the first time.  I had to update to report that my inner thighs, glutes and hamstrings are all still sore two days later from this workout!  The lunges and squats really work your muscles in ways their other DVDs don't target.  I'm very happy with this complete and thorough routine.",1393200000,9,1401,4.515873015873016
6167436,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Full disclosure - I've been an avid fan of Ravi Singh for almost 20 years, and when Ana came along, it was just that much better.  But I have to say, the last two DVD's, Yoga Boot Camp and Body Electric were a little disappointing to me, especially after the amazing triple hits of Solar Power, Transformer and Mediation DVD.  But this Happy Hormones DVD really hits the spot.  It's just the right length, challenging without feeling damaging, and I'm now a firm believer in the endocrine system!  This DVD has a lot of good basic moves, Sat Kriya, stretch pose, forward stretches, cobra, with some fun new twists.  The shaking dance is awesome!!  Yay Raviana!!!!",1393113600,11,663,4.672413793103448
6167437,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I currently own 18 of their DVD's and love them!  I am a yoga teacher and converted power yogi.  I felt like I discovered a whole other experience when I started doing their practices.  If Ana and Ravi told me to spin on my head, I would do it, I have that much positive experiences with their practices.  I had been asking them about what DVD's support hormones, and they were able to point to practices here and there on their DVDs (Fat Free Yoga: Lose Weight and Feel Great & Dr. Yoga House Call), so I was excited when they came out with an entire DVD devoted to this.

Having said this, this one is slower paced and less intense than their Yoga Beauty Body which is also geared towards female strengthening, lengthening and glandular balance.  On their Happy Hormones DVD, they mention exercises that stimulate the pituitary with BOF (Breath of Fire), the Thyroid (the master gland), the sex organs (sat kriya/ rectum-sex organ-navel squeeze and release), and the spine which they say ""supports every organ via the nervous system"".  All in all it is a very well balanced and comprehensive practice.  While I have not experienced the ""kundalini buzz"" right afterwards that I have with their other DVD's, I can tell you that I have done this DVD a few times and already am sleeping better and feeling more energetic.

Now, here for the breakdown,

WARM UP 1 (23 minutes).  It works the hips, spine sex organs, pituitary, and thyroid.  This is the longest of the practices.  The practice is as follows:
  Spinal grinds, seated spinal pose flexing back and forth, rectum/sex organ/ navel squeeze and release, seated spinal pose flexing back and forth with BOF, rectum/sex organ/navel contractions repeat, seated twisting kriya, seated one legged forward bend with BOF, seated two legged bend with BOF, seated arm raised with deep breathing (stimulates thyroid), Sat Kriya (seated with arms raised saying ""sat nam"" while squeezing and releasing again rectum, sex organs, and navel.  They say on the DVD that this particular practice helps with glandular balance and depression.

WARM UP 2 (10 minutes )  A shorter warm up focused on stomach/abs.
It includes the following: Cobra pose up and down with legs apart, lying on stomach butt kicks, flipping over to lying on your back for some ab work with extending legs in frog pose from left, to center, then right repeatedly.

HAPPY HORMONES Pt 1 (10 minutes).  This practice seems like it is focused on toning.
It starts with lying on your back with one leg raised to 90 degrees while pumping your arms in chest press raises (you can also use weights),  This one was difficult and they mention that it stimulated the nervous system which supports the glands.  The next part of this practice is alternating leg lifts while lying on your back.

HAPPY HORMONES Pt 2 (12 minutes).  This practice seems more cardio and abs focused.
It starts with you in downward dog and pedaling your feet (prance dancing) while flexing your spine front to back, and then moves on to repeating the sequence of yoga dancing while in horse stance (shimming up and down), skater lunges from side to side.  Then they move on to standing hop/tap dance, har dance (kicking one foot out at a time while saying ""har"" to ""kick things out of your life that no longer serve you"", and down to the floor on your back for some curved hollow abs work (head and legs lifted) with BOF.  The final move is standing steeple bends moving from left to right.

SHAKE DANCE (8 minutes) This is fantastic!  I really could feel the energy moving here.  You start with your foot and then move the shimmy up the leg until it evolves into a free dance.  It felt like there were some elements of belly dancing here.  Really fun!

The DVD, of course also has the standard intro, breath primer, deep relaxation, and closing prayer, and mantra melody.  There is also an 11 minute segment focused on alignment tips and benefits of the poses which is great, but I wished it was incorporated into the workout itself.  I can't imagine myself watching this first, and then trying to remember it all.

You get to hear Ana do more singing which was really sweet.  All in all, I think it is a good practice which touches a lot of areas.  I think Warm Up 1 seems the most comprehensive for glandular work, and then you can customize with the workouts whether or not you want to focus more on toning or cardio from there.",1391644800,16,4406,4.645994832041343
6167438,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Others have given lovely in depth reviews. This is a simple one. It has wonderful music, GREAT direction, very clear and always spot on! You don't look up and realize they have moved way beyond where YOU are in the pose. I own every single one of their videos. I really enjoy them all, but this one ALWAYS leaves me energized and HAPPY!!! I think it is very accessible to a beginner.  I enjoy the singing meditations and this one has that! It goes a bit over an hour but feels like 30 minutes. I can't say enough about this wonderful yoga routine.
This one is great for days you just don't feel energetic. It helps lift your spirits and gently get you moving! The yoga version of squats (dancing horse stance) and lunges are unique and fun. The shake dance at the end is GREAT! TRY THIS DVD!!!
Again, short review. I just wanted to give it the full 5 stars it deserves and say THANK YOU to Ana and Ravi!!!!",1391644800,8,906,4.267441860465116
6167439,4,B00HKK0MXI,"The music is nice,not meditative but energizing; the warm ups take up half of the dvd; I was expecting more kriyas, maybe even a meditation; I have found most useful their fat free yoga. There are some new exercises and their shake dance moves your whole body making you aware of every single part. Anyway I appreciate their creativity and their work as usual.
A note: Ana has become too lean.",1391299200,4,393,4.549295774647887
6167440,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Happy Hormones is invigorating, fun, and uplifting. It's got awesome new piano music with a Scott Joplin-esque feel that helps me lighten up, tons of breath of fire, a lot of navel work, and Sat Kriya in the warm-up. When I do this DVD in the afternoon, I feel upbeat and unbeatable all evening.

It also includes what have become my favorite standing cardio moves they've ever taught us: a balletic side lunge and a side bowing move that are so pleasurable, I feel I could do them forever. In fact, I'm considering putting the main routine on repeat for myself.

After working the navel in the warm-ups and then doing the cardio, doing the Shake Dance comes naturally. I feel free and like celebrating, and I don't care who sees me shake it :-). It feels like a heavenly bonus track. Unlike so many teachers out there, Ravi and Ana have their priorities straight: Life is supposed to be FUN!

Addendum in response to the less rave reviews: I applaud Ana's singing, which I find soothing and (not surprisingly) Marilyn Monroe-esque. As for the dancing, watching her do the Shake Dance gives me confidence that I can do a crazy dance move and still feel and look beautiful. Last but not least, the yellow and blue outfits are perfect!",1391040000,5,1233,4.595454545454546

Ana & Ravi seem to know just how to sequence a kundalini workout for maximum effects that leave you feeling amazing. I am so happy with this DVD!",1389830400,4,434,4.046511627906977
6167443,2,B00HKK0MXI,"Just got done with trying to do the DVD yet again....  I've been trying to do it one or twice a day for the past week, hoping that I could work past some issues that I have with it.... Such a strong reaction this time, I felt like I wanted to write a review and get some things off my mind.

I first discovered their Fat Free DVD a few years ago based on the gazillion positive reviews.  While it was bit too ""granola"" for me in some respects, I felt that the DVD was focused on the yoga, and I felt that they were focused on using the yoga to help people.  And the yoga did help me.  Now, I have all their DVDs but had to return that one DVD that had the weird football-type drills. I've tried to stick with raviana through the last phase of DVDs with the strange background. In fact, ravaiana DVDs are the only kundalini DVDs that I currently own; I even sought out and bought Ravi's book from many years ago.  I so appreciate that they make yoga accessible and affordable, with the great matrix function that I don't even get in other people's poorly made $30+ exercise DVDs.

This one I really want to like because, well, I want happy hormones, and the yoga itself seems interesting.  BUT....  this DVD, like the last phase of DVDs, seems like it's not about the yoga but trying to hard to.... be too hip or too different or too something...?  While Ana seems like a lovely, well-intentioned person, I don't buy the DVDs for Ana; I buy them because I want to do the yoga to help me feel better.  But this DVD seems to be so Ana-centric. There are multiple pictures of Ana smiling (excessively?) on all the menu pages, which kind of freak me out. I have to go through the menu pages to use the DVD, so they are hard to ignore and put me in a worse mood.  Then when I get to doing the yoga (and yes, I can close my eyes but not my ears), the music is so irritating to me.  The ""theme"" melody that plays during the menu and throughout the DVD sounds like clown/circus music to me. When it plays, I can't help but picture clowns running around in and out of little cars--hardly relaxing.  There are some other music sequences that seem jarring and neither relaxing nor motivating for me.  Then throughout the DVD, Ana makes attempts at singing or (worse) saying words with music in the background--again makes me cringe while I am trying to get into the yoga.  For the meditation, Ana sings. For the standard closing prayer that I used to look forward to end with, but on this DVD, Ana sings a song.  Face it, some of us are not meant to sing in public!  I can't figure out what Ana is doing during the ""Shake Dance,"" just seems like it's meant to emphasize her ""hip-ness,"" and her outfit changes several times (why?) during the Shake Dance.  And at one point in the DVD, Ana actually says the phrase ""LOL"" (more cringing...). When people make exercise DVDs, I wish they would remember that users have to listen to it over and over and over again if we are to use the DVD.  So, attempts at ""clever"" banter become so painful over time for the user.  This is why I can't use my Jillian or Bob Harper exercise DVDs--they try so hard to be ""too cool for school"" that I just can't bear to listen them over and over again. I think that this raviana DVD seems to be going that route for me....sigh.... because I think the yoga on this DVD could be helpful.

I wish raviana would go back to focusing on the yoga.... maybe they could re-release with DVD without all the pictures of Ana and no music?  (maybe time for me to break down and try Maya Fiennes...?)",1389744000,43,3550,4.257824143070045
6167444,5,B00HKK0MXI,"The cover says it all. I feel like happy Ana when I do this fun DVD. This workout is very much within my comfort zone (if a workout is too hard I find myself not doing it). Every time I do this I feel all kinds of little tingles. A very cool sensation. The warm-ups start off with seated hula hoop stomach circles, then there are two spine flexing ones and a twist. There's also forward stretching, an exercise for the thyroid, and Sat Kriya which works on all the glands. Then there is more ab work.  Happy Hormones set 1 has two
exercises you can do with free weights. Set 2 has some dancy moves. Then comes the Shake Dance which is quintessential Ana. A total blast! Then they have a relaxation and beautiful mantra chant. I'm really glad I took the plunge and ordered this. Ana and Ravi have done a great service to everyone who wants to make their hormones happy!",1389744000,2,868,4.2926829268292686
6167445,5,B00HKK0MXI,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Kundalini Yoga Happy Hormones All-In-One Workout has the matrix menu, which allows you to customize the length of your workout.

Introduction (1:13): Sometimes the introduction is necessary to understanding the goal of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs. I don't really think you need to bother with it this time, unless you want to.

Tune In (3:00): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.  The meditation part at the end is a bit longer than in some of their other DVDs.

Warm-Up Part 1 (23:00): This is a the longest warm-up I've seen in one of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs - and it's only the first of two segments. This one is great for working out kinks in the back and legs (helpful early in the morning, especially). Many of these exercises appear in Ana's and Ravi's other DVDs but there are some I haven't seen before, as well. This segment consists of the following exercises.

*While seated, grind your stomach in circles
*Hold your shins and flex your spine back and forth
*Sit on your heels with your hands on your thighs and do breath of fire
*Sit on your heels and flex your spine to the rhythm of the breath of fire
*With your hands in fists at collarbone level, twist left and right
*Put one foot on the inside of the opposite thigh and stretch out over your extended leg (breath of fire)
*Extend out over both legs (breath of fire)
*Seated, with your feet flat and your knees bent, sit up straight and extend your arms overhead
*Lie on your back and relax
*Sat kriya (Google this if you don't know what it is - it's complicated to explain)
*Lie on your back and relax again

I hadn't seen sat kriya in a warm-up segment before.  The move with your feet flat and knees bent and your arms overhead works the abs in surprising ways.  I like this segment a lot, but I like most of Ana's and Ravi's warm-ups.

Warm-Up Part 2 (10:00): This only includes a few moves but they are different from those in the first warm-up segment.  I like having two warm-ups since I like to mix up my yoga workouts a little bit.  Or, you could do them both if you have more time.  I'd say the movements in this segment are a little more advanced than in the previous segment, but should be easily modifiable for anyone.

 *Lie on your stomach with your legs wide and do push-ups into cobra
*Lie on your stomach, prop yourself up on your forearms, and kick your rear end with alternating heels
*Lie on your back, put your feet together in a raised butterfly position, then extend your legs (right, left, middle); bring your legs back to the raised butterfly position between each extension

Happy Hormones Part 1 (10:00): This segment consists of the following exercises.  Note: they say you can do the first two moves with 1-3 pound hand weights, although Ana demonstrates without weights.

*Lie on your back with your left leg at 90 degrees; raise and lower your hands (bending your arms at the elbows) to your shoulders and back
*Lie on your back with your right leg at 90 degrees; extend your arms up to 90 degrees; bring your elbows to the floor and then bring your arms back up
*Alternate leg lifts

Happy Hormones Part 2 (12:00): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*In downward dog, pedal your feet (involve your hips and arms as desired)
*In horse stance, with your index fingers and thumbtips meeting, dance up and down into a deeper pli
*With your hands in the same position as the previous pose, lunge back, crossing the moving leg behind the stationary leg and your arms moving to the side of the stationary leg
*Repeat the horse stance move
*Repeat the crossover lunge move
*Repeat the horse stance move again
*Brief meditation while standing
*Hold your opposite upper arms and do a tap forward/step/hopping combination with your feet (watch Ana a few times to get this one)
*Kick with alternate heels (stay low) and say ""har;"" have your hands interlaced at the small of your back
*Lie on your back, do stretch pose (i.e., head and heels raised six inches) with breath of fire
*Stand with your legs wide and your hands overhead (palms pressed together); bend one knee and lean forward over that knee, touching your hands (still together) to the ground

Shake Dance (8:00): This is done standing.  Essentially, you are moving through body parts one by one and shaking that part.  The shaking is pretty vigorous late in the segment, although there is a slowing-down time near the end.

Deep Relaxation (5:00): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen. I find the music more relaxing here than in some of Ana's and Ravi's other recent DVDs.

Magic Mantra Medley (7:00): This contains three mantras.  You do the first for awhile, then the second, then the third.  They're all sung to the same tune/rhythm, which is a little rushed for the last mantra (which is kind of long).  One of them is in English, which is a little different.  Here they are:

1: You Are the Love in My Heart
2: Ang Sang Wahay Guru
3: Guru Guru Wahay Guru/Guru Ram Das Guru

Closing Prayer (3:00): This is quite a bit different from the other Ana and Ravi DVDs that I have.  But I think change can be good.  This ends with a song, and the only thing I would change would be to put the words to the song on the screen so you can sing along with Ana (it's a little much to remember all at once).  Here are the words (best I can tell):

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide your way on

The melody is nice and I found myself singing this after I was finished with the segment.

Breath Primer (3:00): Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique. This is the exact same content as was included with some of Ana's and Ravi's other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs but has been re-recorded with the new set.

Alignment Tips & Benefits (11:00): One complaint that I've read in reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs is that there's not a lot of instructional time built in (I don't mind this, but some people do).  This segment addresses that criticism.  It goes through each move in the warm-ups and happy hormones segments, gives you pointers on form, and tells you the purpose of the exercise.  If you are new to Ana and Ravi DVDs, definitely watch this.  This one, like the Breath Primer, will play after the credits if at all.  But, you can always choose it from the chapter menu or add it to the Matrix Menu.  (It may not be quite 11 minutes long, for what it's worth.  But it is complete.)

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this one combines the old and the new. The set is a throwback to, say, Fat Free Yoga, with the white background and Ana on a raised white platform.  However, Ana is still blonde and her clothes are more similar to the later DVDs (i.e., Transformer, Solar Power, etc.).  I like the change; for some reason, the fake nature background in Transformer, etc., was distracting to me, and I preferred the simplicity of the white background.  Please note that the production value is higher than in the very early DVDs with the same/similar set.  You never see the edge of the white space and the AV equipment, and I think the cameras and makeup have improved since the early days, as well.  Ana's outfits (and hair) do change frequently in the middle of segments, but you're supposed to have your eyes closed most of the time - and she sticks to a blue/yellow/white color theme.

I think the music is good in this one.  For the most part, it's subtle, quiet, and light.  There's a lot of instrumental music but there are vocals in a few places.  During the tapping/stepping/hopping combo in Happy Hormones Part 2, there's some (old-style) traditional Indian music, but I've always liked this style of music.  I felt the music was appropriately relaxing during the Deep Relaxation segment.

Camera work was mostly good. There were a few fades in/out where you could see 2 or 3 of Ana on the screen at the same time.  Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer standard (boring) camera work where you can always see what Ana's doing, with no unnecessary visual effects.

Ana appears to be very happy throughout this DVD.  She's always smiling and it's kind of infectious.  Don't forget the ""Happy"" part of the title!  It has been my experience that Ana and Ravi don't choose titles at random, but that EVERY word has meaning and relevance.

A few modifications are offered (e.g., alternating raised legs in stretch pose or sitting cross-legged instead of on your heels), but the moves are generally not difficult in this DVD and I do think it would be suitable for beginners.  That's not to say that more advanced people won't get anything out of it - I've been doing Ana's and Ravi's DVDs for years, and I enjoyed this one.  I didn't notice anything that I thought would cause problems, although be careful with standing moves where your knees are bent (watch the Alignment Tips & Benefits segment for more instruction here).  Finally, don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana, nor do you have to stretch as far forward as Ana in the forward-bending moves. Work at your own pace and do what YOU can.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular. (I intend to include a version of this in all my reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs.)

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has downward dog in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD contains a mantra chanting segment. Whenever there are mantras that are not in English, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives and use the matrix menu or your DVD remote to skip the chants. (I happen to like the chants, but that's just me.)

With respect to calorie-burning, this DVD is probably not going to do a ton (although the Shake Dance may get your heart rate up a bit). But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day. (I do about 30 minutes of yoga a day by combining segments using the matrix menu. Ana and Ravi are a part of my fitness routine, but they are not the whole of it.)

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach (if anything, there's more coverage in her clothing here than in some of Ana's and Ravi's other DVDs). And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of instruction in this DVD in the main segments, but of course there's the Alignment Tips and Benefits segment if you need it. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. You'll be glad for the ability to omit the instructional segments later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do down dog; you know it by this point!

A few health claims are made in this DVD, although not as many as I would expect based on the title. Take those that do appear with a grain of salt. I do find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues. At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF and observe some common sense safety guidelines).

If you are struggling with a sequence, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1389744000,100,14531,4.457531143827859

My husband commented that I seem to be in a happier mood more of the time. All of that convinced me that this DVD is making the difference.

Like all their DVDs (I own 18), you get a great workout and at the same time, you get an immediate uplift . After practicing this one daily for the past week I was inspired to sit down and write this review. I feel like Happy Hormones has added something to my practice that is shaking down my life and bringing me to the next level. This may sound odd but this is part of the magic of Kundalini. This stuff really works. The warm-ups are fantastic and part 2, which contains a dance called The Shake Dance leaves me feeling that anything is possible and the future sparkling! I feel super healthy like all my cells are renewed.  Ravi & Ana have been such a blessing in my life, their wise words stick with me all day. The program looks beautiful, Ana has never looked more beautiful, supple and fresh and inspiring. The set is back to their old style sets which I prefer and the music is super fun and inspirational.

This new one has such a high fun factor. What I also like is that even though it's a total workout, the exercises are very doable, even for me, who is not by any stretch :) a fitness maven. In fact, the reason I do their DVDs is that I am pretty much exercise resistant. Somehow their programs keep me coming back for more. I like everything about this one but my very favorite parts of this are the music which is powerful and amazing and the Shake Dance which is total joyous Ana.

What I love about this one is that it has everything: stretching, ab work, strengthening, a cardio element, not to mention all over focus on glandular balance.

Sat Kriya is a kriya in itself and it makes me feel my energy is in a really good place to receive the rest of the workout. Its also amazing pschycotherapy. The main kriya they teach here is one I recognize from my teacher training. It has a number of unusual exercises that get the energy moving, reminding me this in energy work of the most potent kind! The workout culminates in a shake dance that shakes me up in a really great way and makes me feel warm and loose and yes, I believe I feel my hormones circulating! This is my 20th Ravi & Ana DVD. This hearkens back to the earliest ones and reminds me of Fat Free Yoga. Their Solar Power Yoga is another favorite and I am alternating these three for my New years resolution which is to have perfect health and well-being, and peace of mind in 2014!",1388880000,15,969,4.148936170212766

I couldn't order this through Amazon, so I ordered from their website because I wanted it. Bad music, not in their ""traditional"" Kundalini style. I'm done ordering anymore of their DVDs. I will replace my scratched old DVDs and look elsewhere. If you are a fan of past DVDs-skip this. If you have never ordered any of theirs, then start with their other DVDs.",1388793600,22,640,4.573913043478261
6167453,5,B00HKK0MXI,"This was my Christmas present for myself and it is just what I needed after too much traveling and over-indulging over the holidays! I feel like this DVD is the answer to my prayers and tailor made for me! Happier Hormones? Yes Please!!!  I like my yoga workouts challenging but very doable and fun and this is the perfect mix. It is so much fun, that I can't wait to do it again and I actually go to bed at night excited at the thought of doing it the next day! Since I seem to be the first reviewer I should try and tell you about the workout itself. From what I remember: the warm-ups included grinds, flexes, a fun twist where you like a kid driving a toy car, Sat Kriya, various bends for the hamstrings, cobra push-ups with wide legs (my lower back thrives on this part!), some fun new kundalini crunches where you are on your back and move your legs, left, right, and center, and leg and arm raises. I don't have the order of any of these exercises right. I am just listing what I can remember.

Then there are two Happy Hormone Sets, One set starts with arm presses on your back (Ana says we can add light weights which I plan to try today), peddling the feet and hands in Down Dog which feels deliciously stretchy in my spine and hips, dancing up and down in Horse Stance, a fun, hop, skip,step, step, step, little move. Please excuse me not remembering what's in what set, but there is also a step back lunge, a kundalini curtsy type move that feels like a fabulous move for bringing up the rear (LOL). I felt this the next day, or I may have been feeling the exercise where we bend side to side as if pcking up a ball and raising it overhead. These are low-impact cardio moves and there are a few of them, all fun. Oh and then the best part! The Shake Dance! You start shaking your body a section at a time starting with your toes and work your way up. When you get to the scalp suddenly Ana's hair is down and you shake your hair follicles and WOW! This is so much fabulous fun! You are circulating all the energy you stimulated and circulating your hormones to make your body glow. I feel glowing and radiant afterward and my mood has never been so elevated post holiday season and in this cold weather. Seven degrees this weekend? Bring it on! HH's has got my back! The relaxation, music (way cool), mantra chant, all wonderful. If you are thinking about this one. Go for it. You will love it!",1388361600,46,2407,4.253275109170306
6167454,5,B00HKK0MXI,"The term electric is an unusual one to be applied to yoga, but in this case it is very apt.  This little gem from Ravi Singh and Ana Brett will electrify your body.  You will be filled with energy after doing this workout.

Why I love this workout:

* I feel so wonderful during and after the workout.  My body seems to vibrate with energy.  It must be all those breathing exercises and yogic movements.

* It is truly electric.  Sure, it has a yoga feel, but it is fresh and new.

* Its the perfect pick me up for those days when Im feeling tired and out of sorts.  About 10 minutes into this workout, I feel completely different.

* The workout versatility.  You can do the entire workout, which runs about 90 minutes, or pick and choose those sections you want to do.  There are two nerves of platinum sections, so you can do either one or both.

* The matrix actually works and includes all sections.  I was very happy to see that the breath primer and renew you through and through were also included.  I love to start my kundalini yoga workouts with the breath primer to help get me centered.

* It can be as hard or as easy as you like.  Some of the moves, like the plank on your elbow and raising your leg are totally beyond me, but I modify and still get the benefit of the pose.

* The section where you're on all fours and bringing one leg at a time back seems to go on a very long time.  You do it for about 5 minutes and then you do it again, only this time you also raise your arm.  The first time I did this section, I hated it and fast forwarded through it.  The second time was much better and I am so glad I lasted through the entire section.  I felt wonderful afterwards!

My two (minor) complaints with this DVD are:

* The background is the annoyingly fake scenery.  I think it detracts from the workout.  But, since this is my newest favorite Ravi/Ana workout, it doesnt bother me too, too much.

* Anas outfits are a little odd.  Her hot pink shirt is cute, but I think it says, Speedo on it.  What thats all about?  An ad for Speedo?  Her red t-shirt has relax printed in giant letters.  I think its a contradiction to the word relax.

These are minor annoyances and don't stop me from loving this workout.",1388102400,9,2230,4.169411764705882
6167455,4,B00HKK0MXI,"This one has some stuff that i just can't do yet -- so really I should get four stars -- they should get 5! (I have gotten 9 of their dvds in 3 months so I think i am correct when i say) this one has some plow and shoulder stand stuff that i just do happy baby during. But then you will hit some new variation on one of their exercises and kazam you get hooked on another DVD.  On this one I LOVED the sort of Sit up into split / spread legs.  Each of their DVDs has something where I say -- oops -- Wont be sitting on my knees in this one -- as well as WOW!!  look at me!!  I can't believe i am able to do this at FIFTY TWO!!  My nickname for Ana is Sister Machine.  She is tougher than you can possibly imagine, yet so graceful and positive.  I used to lift weights -- and loved the ripped arm look, but she is just tougher than any of that. (Should be getting the tenth and eleventh DVD TODAY!!)

6167456,4,B00HKK0MXI,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, The Body Electric has the matrix menu, which allows you to customize the length of your workout. All exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body, with the exception of one plank where you raise your left leg.

Tune In (2:06): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Warm-Ups (9:20): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*While seated, grind your stomach in circles
*Sit on your knees with your hands on your thighs and flex your spine back and forth
*Mermaid stretch (move your hips/rear to the ground on one side and stretch that arm overhead)
*Interlace fingers at the base of your skull (while seated) and twist left and right with the breath of fire
*With legs and arms together, lean back; then lean forward with your legs wide and your arms crossed in front of you
*With your legs apart, lean forward (static stretch)

Note: for mermaid stretch, I had to use my hands to help in the transition from side to side.  Also beware the possibility of rug burn in that one if you're not using a yoga mat.

Nerves of Platinum Part 1 (11:00): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Standing, interlace your hands behind your back; inhale up eyes open; exhale down, eyes closed (hands stretched away from your back and over your head)
*In horse stance, put your arms to the sides (parallel to the ground) with your palms flexed up; do long deep breathing
*With your legs wide, put one palm to the floor and twist to stretch the other overhead; alternate sides
*Wide-legged forward bend (several options for hand position)
*Modification of locust pose (performed twice with a break in between)
*Plank from elbows (or forearms) with your left leg in the air
*Stretch pose (that is, lie on your back and raise your head and heels six inches)

Nerves of Platinum Part 2 (10:00):  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Plank from your hands with your toes not turned under
*Back platform pose (feet flat, hands behind/under shoulders, head back, hips lifted)
*Side plank (one on each side)
*Sitting, with your hands in a mudra (hand position), hold your arms slightly higher than parallel with the floor
*Relax on your back

Note: I can't do the plank with my toes not turned under because of a foot/knee problem.  I do have to modify this one.  Don't be afraid to modify this or any other pose if you have pain or any joint issues.

Body Bliss Workout (22:30): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Balance on your sacrum with your calves parallel to the floor; crunch side-to-side
*V pose (boat pose); can modify to have your calves parallel to the floor
*Double leg lifts with breath of fire
*On all fours, raise alternate legs behind you while doing breath of fire through puckered lips (long duration)
*Do the leg raises again but this time, also raise the opposite arm (long duration)
*Squats with your arms in front, parallel to the ground
*Sit on your heels; raise your arms to 90 degrees with your palms in and exhale to 60 degrees (to the sides) with your palms out (this is done for three minutes)

Note: There aren't a lot of exercises in this segment, considering the length.  Some of these may be challenging to complete without breaks.  Also note that the parts done on all fours may bother you if you have wrist issues.  If you do have wrist issues, don't do this segment every day, and/or take breaks as needed.  This is actually a pretty serious core workout which includes some work for the back (leg and arm raises), which is nice.

Deep Relaxation (4:00): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi. This segment includes the sound of a gong, but I like the gong more here than in some of the other DVDs where it appears.

3 Minute Meditation (3:00): Sit cross-legged and simply do long deep breathing.  The sound of the gong can be heard in this segment, as well.

Mantra Chant (5:30): This is pretty simple, you just repeat the mantra (below) with your hands on your sternum, one on top of the other.

Narayan Narayan Narayan Hari

Closing Prayer (1:10): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

Breath Primer: Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique. I think this is the exact same segment as was included with some of Ana's and Ravi's other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs.

Renew YOU, Through and Through (5:25): Sit with your arms in front of you, parallel to the ground, hands clasped, and thumbs raised.  Hold your breath out as long as you can, then inhale and exhale and repeat.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the newer ones with the concrete floor, white pillars, fake nature background, and blonde Ana. Both Ravi and Ana narrate and Ana demonstrates the poses and movements. The music in this one seems, to me, like a contemporary take on traditional Indian music (i.e., the words sound like mantras but the style of the music and the rhythms are newer-sounding). I like this music a lot more than what appears in some of the other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs.

I don't care for the camera work in certain parts of this. It seems to jump around randomly, and sometimes there are fades in and out between camera angles that makes it hard to see what's going on. Ana's outfit does change periodically.

I normally skip the introductions to these DVDs, but I would actually suggest watching it for this one.  The intro explains the goals of this collection of exercises and meditations in a way that wasn't always clear to me from doing the exercises, themselves.

As mentioned earlier, be careful in the Body Bliss Workout segment if you have wrist issues.

I feel like this DVD will be best for intermediate to advanced people. Some of the exercises are going to be difficult for beginners, especially the ones that go on for a long time.  I do wish some explanation had been provided as to the longer lengths of time for certain exercises (like the back leg lifts in Body Bliss Workout).  Also, holding the breath OUT as in the Renew YOU, Through and Through segment may be challenging.  Ana and Ravi do offer some suggestions for modifications of certain poses (e.g. boat or V pose with calves parallel to the ground instead of in line with the thighs). Finally, don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular. (I intend to include a version of this in all my reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs.)

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has star pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD contains a fair amount of mantra chanting - there's a separate chanting segment, as well as the opening and closing segments. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives and use the matrix menu or your DVD remote to skip the chants. (I happen to like the chants, but that's just me.)

With respect to calorie-burning, this DVD is probably somewhere in the middle when compared to Ana's and Ravi's other workouts. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do a movement; you know it by this point!

A few health claims are made in this DVD. Take those that do appear with a grain of salt. I do find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues (and, in particular, I like the core work in the Body Bliss Workout segment). At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

This is good for one of those days when you're feeling more energetic, the music is quite upbeat and the exercises are challenging. My biggest complaint is the ridiculous fake tropical set behind Ana which I found incredibly distracting.

Also the Bliss segment features a very long set of raising opposite legs and arms -- this was super difficult for me and I would have liked more variety and to have this broken up somehow but maybe someday I'll be able to finish it. :)",1376265600,,552,4.465346534653466

If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class.

6167459,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD out there.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there via DVD and at the (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

This is a great dvd. I love Ravi & Anna's products. And this one is one of the most complete and varied kundalini dvds I own.",1339459200,4,421,4.023809523809524
6167465,5,B00HKK0MXI,"The exercises in this DVD have already been broken down expertly by other reviewers. (Thank you!) I will add that the first time I did this workout, I had tossed and turned all night and ended up putting in this dvd at 4am. Never has a workout energized me like this one! When it was over, I felt like my body was pleasantly humming with energy and it lasted several hours! I loved the core exercises, as well as the super long sequence of leg lifts and alternating arms. My core, glutes, and frontal deltoids got a really good workout and I felt it the next day. Since starting with Ravi and Ana's dvds about 5 years ago, I feel like they've really changed the way I look at yoga. I love how they focus just as much on your inner self as well as getting in a workout. I feel better about myself and more positive for my future when I do these dvds consistently. The mantras and meditations are beautiful.

One thing that is wrong with this dvd (if I had to pick something lol) is that the times for the premixes are not correct. The actual times run as follows:
Quick Spirit Lift (29 minutes) - Tune In, Warm Up, Renew You Through and Through, Deep Relaxation, Meditation, Closing Prayer
All in One Mini Workout (45 min) - Tune In, Warm Up, Body Bliss Workout, Deep Relaxation, Meditation, Closing Prayer
New Nerves (45 min) - Tune In, Warm Up, Nerves of Platinum Parts 1 & 2, Deep Relaxation, Meditation, Closing Prayer
Total Bliss (58 min) - Tune In Warm, Nerves of Platinum Part 1, Body Bliss Workout, Deep Relaxation, Meditation, Closing Prayer

The premixes provide a good session when you don't have 70 minutes to do the full workout.

To close, I highly recommend all their DVDs, and The Body Electric is one of my favorites so far!",1333152000,8,1740,4.414330218068536
6167466,5,B00HKK0MXI,I have several kundalini yoga videos by Ana and Ravi.  This is my absolute favorite Raviana Kundalini Yoga video.  The narrative is insightful and interesting.  I find myself returning to this video time and time again.,1331596800,,219,5.027777777777778
6167467,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I've been doing this DVD consistently since it came out, so I finally feel qualified to share my two cents about it. I actually think the Ravi and Ana DVD that came out at the same time as this one (""Boot Camp"") should switch names with this one, as this routine is MY boot camp. It gives me a seriously thorough workout, targeting areas of my body that I don't really want to target.

You see, I'm not -really- into exercise. I've had to coax myself into it through the mental health benefits that yoga provides. But I'm also not super into repetitive sun-salutation based workouts, and DVDs that seem to be all about trying to attain complex poses that are out of step with the target difficulty of the rest of a routine. This DVD, like all of the Ana Brett/Ravi Singh DVDs, is decidedly different.

The most comprehensive workout I've found on here comes from doing the Total Bliss pre-set routine (the pre-sets are one of my favorite parts of these teachers' DVDs. The programmable sequencing is great, but I like the feeling of having Ravi and Ana pick my routines for me via the pre-sets most of the time).

There are a few poses in here that I hate doing- during the second round of leg-lifts while down in table pose (this is from the Body Bliss Workout segment), I find myself wanting to throttle the two of them. And yet, if I keep going, I find my heart-rate elevated in a good way, and that I've actually broken a sweat. Yoga Journal recently did a piece on the benefits of doing yoga that gets your heart rate up, so even if my heart rate isn't elevated enough to count, I'm counting this as a positive.

I just adore the energy and the music in this one. This disc may not be all hatha yoga, but it's decidedly kundalini yoga. I am a big fan of those kundalini arm movements!",1329609600,9,1789,4.363363363363363
6167468,5,B00HKK0MXI,I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away by this workout. I have to take exception to another review which said the music isn't great. IT ROCKS! To each his or her own I guess. It is obvious that the authors of this DVD went overboard to provide an amazing experience for all of us. For that my hat goes off to them.,1328486400,3,325,3.9393939393939394
6167469,4,B00HKK0MXI,"Overall this is a good, tough workout, however I didn't like the music in certain segments because I found it too slow. This dvd is aimed for a whole body workout and I'm still sore after two days. It mostly focus on abdominal muscles and glutes. The workout starts with basic warm ups then moves on to nerves of steel. In these segments Ana demonstrates lot of hip openers and deep streches for inner thigh, after that there are two core excercises. After these segment starts the 'body bliss' segment which is the hardest part of the dvd but its still doable. Finally the dvd ends with a relaxing mantra chant followed by closing prayer. Overall I'm quite happy with my purchase, and I intend to make it my regular practice.",1322179200,5,726,4.549618320610687
6167470,5,B00HKK0MXI,Although i like the white simple background and Ana's style of the previous DVDs better the workouts of the new DVDs are great as always!! I love the movements and the music and the inspiring guidance of ravi and ana.,1318377600,,217,4.45
6167471,5,B00HKK0MXI,"Body Electric is magnificent. My first go through taught me about my own resistance. I preferred the old DVDs, the plain set, the old dark hair, the old music, the old dialogue, the old exercises.
By my second or third time through, I had let go of all of that.
The workout is fabulous and exhilarating, the music is perfectly chosen, motivating, even moving at times, and the meditations at the end are divine. I'm not sure what I'd do without this one. Granted, I have ten or twelve Raviana DVDs and every single one is wonderful. When people ask which set I'd recommend buying first, I suggest Fat Free, Yoga Body Beauty, and Warrior Workout, but it doesn't really matter. You'll want more.
If you haven't tried Raviana Kundalini, I envy the trip ahead for you. Best body and spirit yoga experience ever. Enjoy.",1312848000,10,814,4.620689655172414
6167472,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I practice Raviana Kundalini Yoga 5-7 times a week. I am enjoying a mental, spiritual and emotional transformation as a result. Body Electric has become one of my favorite practices. I embrace the challenge of this DVD and feel such strength, peace and energy afterwards. Thank you Ravi and Ana. You do so much for so many and I am so grateful that I am one of them.
Blessings and joy, Sat Nam.",1312416000,4,394,4.410958904109589
6167473,5,B00HKK0MXI,"This is one of the best produced and most powerful yoga DVD's I've ever done. Everything from the music, the exercises, the matrix menu option (which let's  you program your own workout, to the presets, the script, the pacing, is perfect. If you like to work out to DVD's, You have got to experience this one. It really is a cut above.",1311206400,,335,4.403225806451613
6167474,3,B00HKK0MXI,"I like the DVD itself, even if, as another reviewer says, they aren't all traditional poses. They are challenging and I appreciate the variations. As always, the Matrix is a valuable tool for allowing you to create your own workout. I wish more yogas and yoginis would offer it.

I enjoy Ana and Ravi yoga, both pre and post blonde hair. I just wish they wouldn't talk so much! Just give us the pose please, then allow us the silence when doing it. For me, yoga is contemplative as I try to tone down my own inner dialogue. So their outer dialogue, their constant interjections, and unnecessary coaching throughout the DVD is really quite distracting and annoying to me.

Maya Fiennes is a great example of a teacher who knows enough to explain the pose and then quit yapping. That is also true on a few, but not all, of Nirvair Singh Khalsa's DVDs.",1309996800,6,849,4.5064935064935066
6167475,5,B00HKK0MXI,The workout is addictive!  The nerves of platinum segments are a great stand-alone workout when I don't have much time.,1308873600,,119,4.95
6167476,5,B00HKK0MXI,"To many of us, it's no secret that Ana and Ravi have taken the yoga DVD format to the next level and made it into an art form. And, still, somehow they continue to add to their already staggering and masterful body of work! Their standards are incredibly high, and they are pioneers in the fields of not only yoga but also inner alchemy, meditation, and creating your own reality. And this DVD is no exception! It's specifically created to help strengthen your nerves and infuse your life with grace, calm, and inner strength. And, on top of all that, it's an AWESOME total body workout. If it's not already obvious, I can't recommend it highly enough.",1306972800,3,652,4.581196581196581
6167477,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I think this is the type of work out I have been waiting for from Ravi and Ana!!! I have been a fan of their DVDs for several years now. I've enjoyed their newer DVDs (i.e. new backdrop, music, style) but I have always gone back to my old favorites, like Warrior Workout, Yoga Total Tune Up, and Fat Free Yoga, because they were more challenging...though the plain white background and quiet music never thrills me. I'm only just getting back into a regular kundalini yoga practice, but this was a well-needed challenge for me. I broke a sweat and was sore the next day. I had bought KY Bootcamp when these first came out. I still enjoy it, but it didn't excite me the way that Body Electric does! I really love this workout so far.

This workout also has some different aspects from the traditional Kundalini movements, but I love it all. For example, there didn't seem to be as much breath of fire as some older workouts and it took me some time to get used to doing the breath of fire through puckered lips as opposed to the nose. But this is good change for my body. I also enjoyed the music!

I love Ravi and Ana and I'm really happy with this DVD. They have NEVER failed to make me feel better over the past four years that I have been practicing their workouts. Truly such a blessing in my life!",1305676800,6,1302,4.288617886178862
6167478,5,B00HKK0MXI,"This has something for everyone: deep stretching, strength building, and cardio type exercises. It also has a spiritual side. To me, this DVD is exactly what makes yoga different from exercise: it's physical, but there's other levels as well. It's just like people. Some people are just into the physical side of things, but other people find a way to go deeper. I'll be grateful to Ana & Ravi all my days for helping me go deeper.",1305158400,4,431,4.6103896103896105
6167479,5,B00HKK0MXI,"You might think yoga is just breathing, stretching, and meditation LOL But yoga teachers Ana & Ravi want to tone you outside and in! Their new workouts burn more calories than the treadmill and the yoga moves are felt in every happily trembling muscle. This is serious toning and mood uplift. The ending chant makes me happy happy happy :D",1304899200,,339,4.666666666666667
6167480,2,B00HKK0MXI,"I don't know if it's me or the DVD but I'm definitely having a hard time getting into this one.  The poses don't flow naturally for me and I don't enjoy the music.  I LOVED Ravi and Ana's Solar Power, Transformer, and Meditation DVDs'; Body Electric and Boot Camp aren't giving the same immediate feelings of breakthrough.  On the other hand, maybe they are making me work through some major negativity blocks. I will try them a couple more times, and if this changes I will update this review; otherwise I think I will put them to rest and go back to the older DVD's.",1304812800,8,568,4.390476190476191
6167481,5,B00HKK0MXI,This DVD is the perfect yoga session for me. I also love the way that the first part (after warm-ups) entails holding poses with deep breathing. Great for strength building. Works all muscle groups. Then there is a great ab sequence and an ingenious cardio sequence done on your hands and knees. The music is amazing. I love the mantra which Ana sings. It stays in my head all day and keeps me in a good mood. There is so much amazing material on this new one. It's awesome!,1304467200,,474,4.337078651685394
6167482,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I Love It!!  While there has been a mention or two about a few of the non-traditional poses introduced on this DVD, I choose to take a different view.  If you are looking for staid, boring, traditional yoga, then this may not be your cup of tea. If you are looking for an exciting workout that joins the body, mind and spirit and provides fantastic diversity in poses and routines, then this is for you.  I own the entire 22 DVD collection of Raviana works and believe me when I say there is a reason why their DVDs are top sellers on Amazon.  Simply put they are just that good.  Over the years, I had amassed many yoga DVDs.  They literally collected dust because I found they were simply unable to keep my attention with their slow (often tedious) pace and minimal mental and toning results.  After doing KY with Ana and Ravi for the past couple of years, I have toned and sculpted my body where it is in better shape now (in my 50s) than when I was in my 20s.  In addition, I have expanded my mental and spiritual focus exponentially, in ways I never imagined possible.  Raviana workouts literally saved my life after the loss of my daughter to a hit and run driver 16 months ago.  I could never have regained my lost balance, found peace and reconciliation without their workouts, guided meditation and encouragement to achieve spiritual growth (regardless of who or what you believe in from a spiritual perspective).  For those considering KY for the first time, it is the most ancient form of yoga, albeit Westernized, but it is firmly rooted in centuries old methodologies that uplift the mind, body and spirit.  Ravi and Ana use different ways to achieve physical, mental and spiritual strength, balance and tone, but nothing that I would consider radical.  In addition, for those of you who are die-hard Hatha yoga practitioners, several of their recent DVDs offer Hatha routines as well as Power yoga routines.  There is something for everyone.  I would suggest that you visit their extensive DVD offering.  Check the reviews, where you will always find one or two reviewers that have provided a detailed breakdown of the DVD.  As for ""The Body Electric"" -- try it, you might just like it.  You might find yourself falling in love like I did when I acquired my very first Raviana DVD!  With this DVD, you might need a hose to put out the fire because it's hot!",1304294400,22,2371,4.575829383886256
6167483,4,B00HKK0MXI,"I love raviana DVDs!! and I so glad they came out with these new ones. It's a great workout and I love doing it...

Now I rated this DVD as a 4 star and not a 5 star for a couple of reasons:

1. during the intro there was some weird colour affect thing going on, thank god it didn't last the whole DVD.. at first I thought there was something wrong with the colour setting of my TV
2. the production value didn't seem as high as some of their other DVD here why: at the beginning in the first exercise segment Ana is wearing this pink ""speedo"" shirt and white shorts and it really looks like she's standing in front of a green screen.
3. the music is good but! it often time was too loud compared to the voice cues, and for those of you who know the previous DVD you know they always set the music to match the pace of each exercise but that is not the case here.

But overall it's good and those are all thing I can look passed.",1301184000,8,929,3.9572192513368982
6167484,5,B00HKK0MXI,"I was exhausted when I did this workout, but was so excited to try it out, that I had to give it a shot the minute it arrived. I found the workout challenging but doable, and by the end I felt still a bit tired (I had only slept a few hours the night before) but really energized and relaxed mentally and physically. There are some LONG stretches in the Body Bliss segment, but I personally love this aspect of KY for helping me get out of my head and into a really tranquil state of being. It really gives me a natural high when I finish one of those tougher sets.

I wouldn't recommend this to someone who's completely new to this style of yoga as I don't think it's necessarily the best introduction- I always recommend Fat Free yoga and yoga Beauty Body for an intro to both KY and Ravi&Ana but if you're a fan of Ana and Ravi, then get this one- you won't be disappointed- it's really fun!

*Update: I've been doing this video consistently since I got it (not all of it all the time, but at least 3-4 times a week, often more, I do at least part of this video) For several weeks I hadn't been able to do anything else due to time constraints- no gym, etc. but this past week I returned to a boot camp/circuit class I've attended regularly for a while and I was really amazed at how much my aerobic capacity had increased due to regularly practicing just this workout! A class I used to find pretty challenging seemed really easy (everyone else was really having a hard time, so it wasn't an easy workout) and I think the breathwork and longer aerobic sections in this really made a difference. I'm including this update because for a long time I've wondered if I could really do just KY for fitness, and this seems to support that idea. I love the other new video as well (Boot Camp Flow) but this one has been living in my DVD player and I can't wait to do it every evening!",1300579200,15,1880,4.219444444444444
