8106753,5,B000E6EJVQ,"Whats there not to buy? 3 of the greatest comedies of all time in one package for a great price! Just buy it without thinking. Surely, you cant be serious? I am serious, and don't call me Shirley. You need these movies.",1522627200,,219,4.238095238095238
8106754,5,B000E6EJVQ,How can you not love this!  Perfect!!,1414108800,,37,4.285714285714286
8106755,5,B000E6EJVQ,"Many times old movies are the best.  There is so much violence and sex in the movies these days.  I know, these old movies are stupid funny, but they are still funny.  No stress in watching these.",1391299200,,196,4.243243243243243
8106756,5,B000E6EJVQ,"These are three of the greatest movies ever made. Yes, stupid humor, but I love it. Having all three in a box set is very convenient...I watched all three within a week of Christmas!",1390003200,,182,4.382352941176471
8106757,4,B000E6EJVQ,"This is the way to go if you want to add Naked Gun and Airplane to your movie collection for cheap. Especially if you don't care about the sequels, which were not all that great anyway.

The only problem with these triple feature packs is where to put them if you keep your movie collection alphabatized. Also, the 3rd movie usually stinks! But still, this DVD costs less than purchasing even 2 of the 3 movies individually.

PS: I filed it under ""A"" for Airplane. =)",1294272000,2,467,4.4186046511627906
8106758,5,B000E6EJVQ,"If you've watched too many HD, Next gen movies like T.D.K and etc.. you will probably get board of classic movies line Airplane, and Top Secret, but you'll find Naked Gun to be a stupid but funny movie.

If you like classic films and can understand and take a joke you'll be ROFL.",1237161600,2,280,4.283018867924528
8106759,5,B000E6EJVQ,"I'll keep this simple. The three movies included in this pack are the best satire/farce movies ever made. They took the idea of making fun of a genre started by Mel Brooks (Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles) and exploded it into gut wrenching laughter. Only the fact that the characters actually think this is really happening keep this from being a ""fourth wall"" breaker. Aside from that, the humor is in your face! They may be getting a bit dated, but these are great movies and they are presented well in this DVD package.",1220832000,11,527,4.67741935483871
8106760,4,B000E6EJVQ,"We purchased this set and checked the ratings for viewing by our children.  Don't let the PG rating fool you into thinking ""Airplane"" is okay for kids!!!  My 9-year-old had the surprise of his life (as did I!) when a nude woman crossed the screen.  Took days to wipe the smile off his face.  Now his brother wants to watch...",1176163200,11,325,4.366666666666666
