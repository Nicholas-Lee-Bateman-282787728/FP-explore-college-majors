8227426,3,B000X9LSDG,"It's quite dated, but the value for me was in the comments at the end from former JWs.  Although the organization may have evolved in the last 40 years, I think a lot of the basic behavioral patterns remain the same, including control of information, and the severe shaming that associates any inquiries that challenge Watchtower doctrine, nearly all of which end up in exit from the org.  DVD is almost all monotone lecture, which almost put me to sleep.  The interviews at the end kept me from pitching it.  I really feel for those in the JW faith; they are truly voluntary prisoners.",1444953600,3,586,4.605769230769231
8227427,5,B000X9LSDG,"Most of my family, sadly are JWs.  It's a cult, I've experienced racial hatred (of Africans), sexual molestation, propaganda, etc.  I've heard of rape (an elder raped a lady while he was in service supposedly).  JWs predicted the end of the world at least 7 times, even the leader is buried in an Egyptian pyramid in Pennsylvania, with Masonic symbols on it.  I'm not saying Egyptology or Masonic movement is bad or good, but if JWs today say it is, then what does that say about their leader?  It's a cult that makes billions of dollars each year off the brainwashed members.  So sickening.",1295136000,7,591,4.634615384615385
8227428,3,B000X9LSDG,"The facts are there but the presentation is so dry it's painful.
The Watchtower Society is a cult (no doubts about it) anyone thinking of joining should run for their lives, I was a JW for 30 years. Wasted my life with this crackpot bunch of loonies.
They believe their leaders in NY speak for God, soon God will destroy all of mankind and ONLY the few million JWs will enter a edenic utopia paradise, petting lions and eating fruit. What a bunch of BS!",1286928000,10,453,4.341176470588235
8227429,4,B000X9LSDG,"This is very informative, but dry.  Many already know that Dr. Walter Martin was a leader on Cults.  This documentary only serves as a reminder.  The information is solid, but the delivery is dry.",1200096000,8,196,4.705882352941177
