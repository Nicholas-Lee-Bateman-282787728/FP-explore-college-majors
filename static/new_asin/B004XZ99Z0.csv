4498560,5,B004XZ99Z0,"Well, now I think I've seen everything. A DVD about how to grow pot! Almost everyone worldwide has an opinion on marijuana. Should it be legal or not, its health benefits, is it worse for you than the medical problem it is trying to help alleviate? Is it downright evil, and reprehensible? Well, those issues are not discussed here, nor should they be. This is a straight documentary showing tips and tricks on growing marijuana for medical purposes.

Nico Escondido, who is the current cultivation pro and a photographer for High Times magazine used to be a grower of marijuana operations in a variety of climates, political settings and commercial formats around the world. He decided to make this DVD so that patients just starting out in their first medicinal gardens as well as the expert growers could pick up a few extra tips and tricks.

Nico is the only guide throughout the DVD and even though he is an expert at what he does, everything is explained at a layman level, with a bit of humor thrown in every once in a while. He starts us out in an empty house with no inside walls and takes us through, step by step, as we see the construction of a grow room. During this, we see examples of different materials to use, and less expensive options. From there we move on to the complete operation of growing marijuana indoors. From seedlings to the drying process, Nico is very thorough in his presentation and making sure that growers of every level can understand the instructions.

Next up is greenhouse growing, which can be cheaper because it uses the natural sunlight to benefit the plants. The start to finish process is repeated with some alternatives native to greenhouse growing. We learn tips and tricks that deal with planting, feeding and watering. There is a great section that deals with cloning plants if you find a breed that you like.

Lastly we are introduced to outdoor cultivation in California. This was the most interesting section to me personally because of old, fond memories. Nico takes special time out to show medicinal growers who have a plant limit per patient law placed on them, how to get the largest and most productive plants you possibly can. Also covered in this section is natural watering techniques, water storage, dirt-free soil options and recycling root bulbs.

This DVD is the be all end all of marijuana growing technology. It has everything anyone from a beginner to an expert would need to start growing medicinal marijuana plants.

The extras on this disc run the gamut from informative to hilarious. You Get an interview with Chemdog (another grower), Garden Problems (What not to do in a grow room), Nutrient Conversation (for the plants), Outtakes, The You'll Notice Game (Take a drag every time Nico says ""you'll notice"", during the documentary), Soundtrack(just a list of the songs in the documentary), Nico On The Web (self-explanatory) and Headshop, which I believe is a feature you get when putting the DVD into your computer. Sound is great and the DVD is shot in widescreen giving the documentary a movie-like feel.

If you are interested in horticulture, medicinal marijuana, or are just curious about the subculture, then this DVD is a must own for you. 10/10.",1372032000,2,3228,4.815884476534296

4498563,3,B004XZ99Z0,"This DVD contains some interesting ideas for the large scale commericial grower, however a home grower would find most of the details unnecessary or difficult to impliment. If you live in a medical state you should probably work for someone else with the skills needed before attempting this anyways. However, it was an entertaining watch.",1353456000,,339,5.181818181818182
4498564,5,B004XZ99Z0,"This is a great video for those who are new to the scene or need a few extra pointers at the intermediate level. Nico shows you several ways you can grow based on your income and depending on where you live rural/city/suburban. Nico tours professional grows and explains how they manage to grow 10+ pound trees as well as confined rooms where its manageable for the single person. Everything from what soil is used, nutrients, cloning, harvesting, lighting, growth rate, installation, varieties, biology and much much more. Everything that's needed to know in a 2 hour experience",1336780800,,579,4.979381443298969
4498565,1,B004XZ99Z0,"To start, a couple of these gardens look great, but by no means are they professional. Mr. Escondidos doesn't know enough to be teaching anyone. His transplanting was a joke. He ripped the plant out and left half of the lower part of the medium in the pot. He doesn't even know the proper wording for the materials he's working with. In the extras if you listen closely you will hear a discussion between Mr. Escondidos and one of the growers where they obviously have no idea how their plants turn out so beautiful. Which is the case for many growers. But when is the last time you heard of High Times hiring someone who actually has a real horticulture education. They're all amateurs, except a few guest writers like Eric Biksa. Don't waste your money unless you want to see video of other peoples gardens, which Mr. Escondidos didn't grow.",1323993600,5,843,4.589403973509934
