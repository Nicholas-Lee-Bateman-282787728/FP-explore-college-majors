8136194,3,B000H4JH8U,"The content is perfect. Couldn't ask for better information in a single exciting package. The problem is, they fit 4 hours of material on to 1 DVD! Granted this was made in 2007, there is still no excuse for this level of video compression. PBS has done this time and again. Forgoing video quality and releasing a cheap single-disc version, when a two disk version, with much less video compression is in order. Had they no idea consumers were going to have large TVs? Dear PBS I would be willing to pay even more if you would just release this in the quality presentation it deserves. A two disc DVD release, or a multi-disc blu-ray release are certainly in order as well. If video quality is of no consequence to you, then by all means go for this disc.",1457481600,3,755,4.438848920863309

8136196,4,B000H4JH8U,"Firstly, if you are looking for a history of every military aircraft built, then this is not it.  Having said that, PBS do a wonderful job of explaining things that most other aviation documentaries I have seen go nowhere near.  For those used to hearing that the Sopwith Camel was hard to handle, but never got a good explanation why, then this set is for you.  Curious as to what the ""area rule"" that frustrated designers of aircraft was?  then this is the best explanation I have seen of it.

There are lots of little gems of information in this set that are rarely found elsewhere.  It won't give you a comprehensive knowledge of this history of warplanes, but it sure fills in some the gaps that others leave out.  Recommended for those who already have some knowledge of history and planes who want a different perspective on the topic,  and those wanting to learn about the science behind flight.",1396051200,4,903,4.6
8136197,5,B000H4JH8U,"This is a must see&have for all those interested in the evolution of Air Power, international history, strategic studies.  The four part DVD is very well done with scientific details explained like no where else. You will see it over and over again.

 It again proves why PBS is such a great institution that needs the support of all of us.",1192060800,10,340,4.540983606557377
8136198,5,B000H4JH8U,"This film is about the evolution of warplanes, as the DVD cover has said. The Wright Brothers gave birth to the first practical airplane and had foreseen the value of airplanes for the military purpose. It is French government raised this infant and proved its value for reconnaissance in the World War I.

Since the World War I, airplanes became an indispensable equipment in the military. Later improvement, such as propeller, engine, agility and even radar, followed in many countries. In modern years, stealth technology and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) are the centerpiece under the spotlight.

Overall, the stories and people behind these warplanes are highlighted. The technical explanation is pretty detailed and convincing. It is by far the best film for this topic I've ever seen and I believe this DVD is a must-have for any warplane maniac.",1178496000,12,856,5.151079136690647
