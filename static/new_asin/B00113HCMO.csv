It really lays out the basics, forming a solid base of knowledge while building on that knowledge throughout the DVD.  I am a tenured mechanic that was searching for a better teaching tool for my customers; this video offered some great insights that I had not even considered-the brake/der cable lubing sections, tire changing and installation section, chain installation, handle bar wrapping.  I did find that some of the sections might have been a little drawn out but at the same time, the amount of information that is made available and its  format allow you to skip and jump to the sections you need or want to learn about.  I had hoped that the film would contain der adjustments and wheel truing sections but after contacting the director - he confirmed that this is the first DVD in RYDE Productions series on bike repair.  So we can expect future DVDs that will complete the series on bike repair.  Overall I am happy to have a better product to offer my customers that want to learn more about their bikes.  Considering its price and knowing that future installments are on the way - makes this the one and only comprehensive teaching tool of its kind in a easy to use DVD format.  I would definitely recommend this video.",1216512000,6,1306,4.619047619047619
8368331,1,B00113HCMO,"I picked this up, hoping to learn how to do my own bike repairs.  What you learn is very elementary.  I can't believe it was about a half of an hour on washing your bike.  I want to know how to tune the bike, adjust the derailleur, etc.  Nice showing on how to wrap your handlebar, but was it necessary to do the whole thing again for the other side of the handlebar?  Fast Forward is your friend here.  There was a good discussion of changing and repair of tires, and installing a chain.  Quality of video was not that great.  Many video/audio dropouts.

If you have never owned a bike, this may be some good elementary info, but don't expect to learn any in depth repairs.",1213920000,10,674,4.244094488188976
