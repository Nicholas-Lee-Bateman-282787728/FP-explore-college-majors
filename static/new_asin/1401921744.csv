174876,3,1401921744,"My review goes counter to Abraham's advice but there must, in my book, be a place for positive criticism.

My question is, Jerry and Esther how can you let such poorly filmed material be released in your names?  The camera work is out of focus more than it is in - and I don't just mean a little soft but really badly focussed, as if by amateurs who don't know how to use the equipment. One of the cameras on Esther is obviously on too long a lense to be of any use - it constantly flits in and out of focus and suffers from vibration; but even the stage cameras on the questioner are not immune from focus problems and they are not any distance away so they have no excuse.

Please E&J - you must have plenty of funds available to you to have your workshops properly filmed by professional crews....",1217376000,15,800,4.215686274509804
174877,2,1401921744,"This is a good bargain and a good place to watch Abraham interact with those in the ""hot seat"".  I have watched this many times and pick up something new each time.  It really depends on what mood and mind frame I'm in.  Abraham says their message is always the same and they laugh at how nit-picky those of us in human form are.  I have each of the other DVD's and enjoy them too.  HOWEVER,  On the down side, I have become aware that about half of the ones chosen to be in the hot seat seem to be shills planted in the audience and appear to have pre-planned questions.  This became apparent after I attended a workshop and during the breaks noticed certain people would come up to the front to converse with their staff.  I found it ironic that these same people would be called to the hot seat and many were reading their questions from note cards.  I also noticed sometimes Abraham will point in a direction and says ""Stand if you think it is you"".  Only then would Abraham (Esther) single out the people I had seen conversing with the staff earlier.  What really made the suspicions concrete was watching the young lady at the end of this DVD who asked the question about God.  Watch closely and you will see what I am talking about.  She is reading a question that it is obvious Esther wrote (or maybe re-wrote).  Esther over uses the phase ""in other words"" and as this young lady is reading the question very slowly it is obvious.  True, it may have been her question originally but must have been rewritten by Esther for clarity.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good question and the answer is amazing.  It just reeks of marketing with a hint of condescension.  It makes me a little sad.",1213660800,26,1693,4.337579617834395
174878,5,1401921744,"I have alot of Abe stuff and hesitated, thinking this might be redundant. SOOOOO glad I got it. Abraham gives you the power you have always been seeking, in molding your thoughts, emotions, reactions and expectations to the world around you so that you can see the world and others in the proper perspective...you feel safe, in control and excited to be alive. There is nothing like Abraham that I have found and this is a great addition to my collection.",1212192000,26,455,4.62962962962963
174879,5,1401921744,"Less than a year ago, I discovered Esther and Jerry Hicks and the Teachings of Abraham, and I was an instant fan! I immediately ordered and read several of their books, and watched ""The Law of Attraction in Action Vol. I."" This DVD Master Course is OUTSTANDING! Even non-fans would love this. There are 10 sessions over a 5-day period on the Alaskan cruise. Each session is filled with uplifting and very helpful and useful information. Esther/Abraham takes questions/problems from the audience and dispenses VERY good information to help the seminar participants solve their problems and turn their lives around. Any viewer will find this information very useful in their own everyday lives, from financial and money matters, to health concerns, to relationships and everything in between! Order this and use the information to start improving your life today!",1211068800,37,861,5.201438848920863
174880,5,1401921744,"I find this information much more helpful than when I read the Abraham books
because, they are regular people with everyday questions, to which Abraham gives the answers in a more personal way that it is easier to understand.

This is truly amazing information but, sometimes hard to digest since our world does not usually think this way, and we have forgotten that this is really how our inner guidance is telling us the whole time to be, and now a days we feel guilt or worry for feeling good.

Thank you Abraham for reminding us that feeling good is our nature.",1210291200,5,565,4.529411764705882
174881,5,1401921744,"Ester Hicks channels and translates for a group of non-physical beings called Abraham. Abraham is very inspirational, and surprisingly funny. Abraham says that they have only one message, just packaged in different ways. That is true, but there are levels to their messages.

From these teachings I learned that our emotions are our guidance system. If something feels bad, that is telling us it is creating a bad ""vibrational escrow"" by creating negative thoughts. For instance, Ester watched the Presidential debates, because it was ""interesting"" but it made her feel bad. Then she watched the second Presidential debates, and Abraham said ""Why are you doing this? You know how it made you feel the first time."" And these bad feelings and subsequent negative thoughts create a negative vibrational escrow.

Our vibrational escrow is created by our thoughts. It is an escrow, because there is a delay in our thinking and it manifesting. If we think ""I want to be thin,"" then go on an emotional rant of ""I hate being fat! None of my clothes fit. Everyone else is skinny. Everything I eat goes right to my hips...."" The universe is right there saying ""okay"" to every single thought. So it is important to clean up our sloppy thinking, make sure it is positive, and in fact what we want.

Abraham talks about being in vibrational alignment. This is done by moving up the emotional scale, and they go through a couple of examples demonstrating how to get out of a bad cycle of thoughts, moving up a little bit all the time. Eventually you get to the point where you feel good. Abraham teaches that when you are in vibrational alignment with your desires, you can have anything you want.

One of the traps we fall into is focusing on ""what is."" So if world hunger is a concern of yours, focusing on it, instead of dreaming up all the solutions, keeps world hunger in your vibration, and not the solution.

Abraham talks about money, relationships, politics, health and healing, death, addictions, animals, so many things, and they do all have similarities. I had to go through the whole of this program twice before I felt like I had a basic understanding of what they were saying. For instance, some of the terminology I had to learn from context.

But the most interesting thing was, the whole time I was taking these messages in, I felt good, really good. I felt like a pathway was open from me to the Divine, a sort of spiritual sunroof that I intend to keep open.

Two closing thoughts, Abraham says the underlying message is ""You are good, and you should be happy!"" Abraham also recommends that we say to ourselves several times each day ""I care how I feel, and I want to feel good!"" I have typed that up and put it all over the place. I hope you feel as good as I did when you study this.",1208995200,53,2791,4.592369477911647

7795459,3,1401921744,"I love Abraham-Hicks stuff...whether it's real or not.

However, it's a bit hard to believe that a group of spirits with infinite beingness choose to only speak about the same things over and over again...without furthering levels of depth like other spiritual leaders have.

It's far easier though for humans like Esther to sound brilliant when focusing on spitting out continouslly differing versions of the same material...over and over again.

I'm not convinced she is channeling anything. I don't think that spirit mediums have that degree of control to instantly, on demand...be able to channel someone. Especially dozens of times a year, to be recorded, over the period of several years.

I do understand that believers will look forever whatever ""evidence"" they need to validate their strong beliefs in something...mainly because it has helped them so much, and they really, really, want to believe.

How 'bout just belive in something beyond yourself...like God, the universe, the Tao, etc.

Even so, it's just as good as any other personal growth/spiritual program. Just don't fool yourself into thinking that you are being connected to the ""other side."" If you want that, then find a good and trusted medium.",1370995200,4,1219,5.1938775510204085

However, this DVD program just covers it all.  The people are real, the conversations are just incredible, and I just listen to it or watch it every chance I get because it is so uplifting.

7795463,5,1401921744,"I own many of the Abraham-Hicks recordings (CD & DVD) and this is currently one of my favorites. There's a reason they call it The Master Course. If you're familiar with the basics of the Abraham teachings and you're interested in getting into material that's a little more advanced, this is a good choice. People that spend the money and time to attend an Abraham cruise are highly likely to be experienced students of the Abraham teachings, and I found the questions asked by most workshop participants on this recording (and the answers given) to be particularly satisfying.
