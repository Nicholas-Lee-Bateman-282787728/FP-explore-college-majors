8317237,3,B001L4O4Y2,I was surprised that I could use so few of the recipes. Most were overly fancy or contained ingredients that I don't like. i have been accused of having a boring taste bud so it is not the fault of the preparers. I merely do not like the ingredients.,1403308800,,250,4.122448979591836
8317238,4,B001L4O4Y2,The video was clear and easy to follow the chefs made it so easy to follow the steps in preparing and cooking that it wasn't hard to make the dishes afterward.  Great video!,1371254400,,173,4.242424242424242
8317239,5,B001L4O4Y2,I LOVE GIADA AND THE OTHER DVD'S OF HERS THAT I'VE PURCHASED. WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THE STINGY PACKAGING THAT THIS DVD COMES IN. IT'S A PAPER CARD COVER THAT TEARS OFF AT THE TOP. I GUESS THAT I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED CLOSER AT THE PICTURE. THE DVD IS GREAT.,1342051200,2,258,4.078431372549019
