8087167,4,B000BITVAQ,"Released in 1969 and directed by Nathan Juran, ""Land Raiders"" is an American Western curiously shot in Europe starring Telly Savalas and George Maharis as estranged brothers in Arizona circa 1875. The former is greedy and stirs up hostilities with the Natives in order to drive out settlers so he can scarf up their land cheap. Meanwhile, the latter returns to the family ranch after a long absence smelling corruption. Guy Rolfe appears as the major of a local fort while Phil Brown is on hand as the local sheriff.

This is a well-made Western by the proven director of 1958's ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" and 1962's ""Jack the Giant Killer."" If you didn't know better you'd think it was shot in Arizona, where the story takes place. The score is by Ennio Morricone's orchestrator Bruno Nicolai and it's decent. The cast is great with Savalas chewing the scenery as the charismatic brother on a power trip contrasted by handsome Maharis as the troubled, but noble sibling.

The movie does well in the female department with four  count 'em four  beautiful women in various roles: Janet Landgard plays the Sheriff's daughter, Arlene Dahl the corrupt brother's wife, Jocelyn Lane the noble brother's old flame and Marcella Saint-Amant a saloon senorita. Moreover, the film checks all the boxes of Western staples, like a saloon brawl, an Indian attack on a wagon train, cavalry & fort sequences, a stampede, shootouts and various romances. Furthermore, the plot is more interesting than the conventional revenge or greed motifs of Spaghetti oaters, which sort of gives away that it's an American production.

Unfortunately, the set-up of the first half is more promising than the somewhat comic booky execution of the second half; and the Natives are all obviously dark-skinned Caucasians from the Mediterranean (just guessing). It's also marred by the (obvious) use of stock footage in at least one of the action sequences. Nevertheless, ""Land Raiders"" delivers the goods as an action-packed Euro Western with dramatic punch. I don't get why it's so obscure as it's just as good, if not better, than more well-known Westerns of the same period.

The movie runs 101 minutes and was shot in Spain and Hungary.

8087171,3,B000BITVAQ,"Of all the Westerns I have seen, this production (filmed in Spain and Yugoslavia) probably bears the least resemblance to actual Western history. As one example, the heroine spends six months traveling across the country by wagon train during the 1870's, when the trans-continental railroad has been in existence for years. Indians who are supposed to be Apaches dress like Sioux or Cheyenne. There is plenty of violence, and even a couple of brief glances at topless females. If that sort of thing is what you like in a Western, you could do worse.",1417305600,,549,4.851063829787234

8087173,2,B000BITVAQ,"""Land Raiders"" (1969) is a film full of icons that I feel are worthwhile. This 1969 Charles H. Schneer production (the man responsible for ""Mysterious Island,"" ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and a number of ""Sinbad"" entries and even ""Half a Sixpence"") was a late direction of Nathan H. Juran, the pro responsible for ""The Deadly Mantis,"" ""Jack the Giant Killer"" and some ""Sinbad"" movies among many others. This western that stars TV icon, Telly Savalas but let's not forget he shares top billing IN the movie with George Maharis.  In fact, they play brothers, and I am embarrassed to admit, I bought ""Land Raiders"" thinking George Maharis was pictured on the cover art, but when the DVD arrived, I was dismayed to see the image was actually Telly's, so it seems like less of a stretch that they could play brothers convincingly.  Also in the cast is Arlene Dahl (Carla in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" (1959)) and she even bares her ample breast shockingly in a scene opposite George Maharis as her brother-in-law showing her what ""he does wid 'whores.'""  (This was filmed in Europe).  The love of his life is played by another icon, Jocelyn Lane, who to many bring audiences on the strength of her in the cast.  She starred opposite Elvis in ""Tickle Me"" and stole the picture from him, but here she is wasted with a perhaps too thick Mexican accent and a too small part.  George's Mexican accent suits him.  His action scenes are realistic and he is interesting when he lets go with his anger.  He shows sensitivity.  The music by Bruno Nicolai seems to be an Ennio Morricone ""wannabe.""  I will say that Telly should have been kinder to George as George makes the movie Telly is now given top billing.  Today that won't happen often.  I've watched it several times already.",1305072000,4,1776,4.657051282051282
8087174,2,B000BITVAQ,"Although Austrian-born director Nathan Juran made a name for himself with his science fiction themed films, such as ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"" ""The Deadly Mantis"" and ""First Men in the Moon,"" he was no stranger to westerns. He helmed two Audie Murphy oaters, ""Drums Across the River,"" ""Gunsmoke,"" and ""Tumbleweeds"" as well as the Fred MacMurray western ""A Good Day for a Hanging."" Nathan Juran's last western, the Columbia Pictures' release ""Land Raiders"" is an average horse opera about a greedy, amoral Arizona rancher who will do whatever it takes to steal land so he can build himself an empire. ""Land Raiders"" is a 1950s style western with 1960s sensibilities. Lensed on location in Spain and Hungary, graced with an exceptional score by Ennio Morricone's orchestrator Bruno Nicolai, this sagebrusher deals with deceit and racism on a widespread basis.

Ultimately, Telly Savalas plays the villainous brother and Maharis is cast as the heroic sibling. A major criticism of this western is the suspension of disbelief required to accept these two actors as kind. Although the story is pretty formulaic, ""Land Raiders"" contains many examples of great editing, especially the shifts from one story to an entirely different one. This outdoor adventure has no shortage of action with rampaging Apaches on the warpath and whites who are willing to kill them to collect the bounty on their scalps. The major problem with ""Land Raiders"" is the Ken Pettus screenplay that focuses on the sibling rivalry between the Mexican brothers Vincent Carden (Telly Savalas of ""Kelly's Heroes"") and Paul Cardenas (George Maharis of ""The Satan Bug"") who hate each other's guts with a passion. The ugly secret that has made them sworn enemies looks like something out of a 1950s movies. Furthermore, Vince forsakes his Mexican heritage because he wants to assimilate and become an American, while Paul refuses to turn his back on his Hispanic origins. Between them is the mysterious death of Paul's fianc, Luis Rojas (Jocelyn Lane of ""The Angry Hills""), who died from a broken neck after her horse threw her. Nevertheless, everybody in the town of Forge River holds Paul responsible for her death, but the local town sheriff, John Mayfield (Phil Brown of ""Star Wars""), could not assemble enough evidence to arrest him, so Paul has roamed the southwest with the memory of Luis plaguing him.

Meanwhile, the Army wants to make peace with the Apaches and they dispatch Major Tanner (Guy Rolfe of ""King of the Khyber Rifles"") to persuade Carden in the name of peace to stop offering a reward on Apache scalps. Vincent pays his gunmen $10 for male Apaches, $5 for female Apaches, and $2.50 for their children and he has no plans to stop this unsavory practice. Paul is riding in the opposite direction when he encounters a wagon train, warns them about Apaches on the warpath, and saves one wagon. He saves the Sheriff Mayfield's gorgeous daughter, Kate (Janet Landgard of ""The Swimmer"") and decides to hang around town. When Vince learns from Colonel Tanner that an Indian agent from Washington,D.C., plans to sit down with the Apaches and smoke the peace pipe, Vincent figures out that prosperity will do his business no good so he sends his gunmen out to kill the Indian agent and frame the Indians for his death.

Eventually, all of Vince's evil catches up with him in the form of three arrows in his chest after the Apaches storm Forge River and kill just about everybody in sight. The major flaw in this western is that Telly Savalas overshadows George Maharis with his dynamic screen presence and Maharis' hero comes off looking pretty useless. Talk about a lopsided yarn! One of the aspects of this western that makes it rewarding for film buffs is the solid editing. Juran does a good job with scene shifts by having one character perform an action that inconspicuously leads to a different scene but does so very smoothly. For example, a child toss a rifle to somebody off camera, but Juran lets the action of the flying rifle bridge the scene change and the rifle winds up in different hands and the scene has changed.",1268784000,4,4107,4.889526542324247
