8383157,5,B002WIK5WG,"This dvd was extremely well done. One of the best on chi kung. If you like this type of chi kung, you will not be disappointed in the quality of instruction. There is a lot of chi kung on this dvd and may require tremendous self discipline to actually practice all of it. I am not his student, I just have to give credit where credit is due. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone.",1337126400,5,386,4.092105263157895
