8455719,5,B0053U80KY,I Love It!  Beautiful Scenery!,1497744000,,30,5.0
8455720,5,B0053U80KY,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
8455721,2,B0053U80KY,"You could be walking anyplace, few vista views.",1410220800,,47,5.0
8455722,4,B0053U80KY,"Great job.  I enjoy the evening walks.  I feel that the pace of this one is a bit much for an order person or beginner.  Also, it would be nice to have it in sections in order to choose the walks and not start-over for the whole program.  I enjoy the scenery and would love a few breaks to view the panorama.",1405209600,,308,3.9193548387096775
8455723,2,B0053U80KY,"I was looking forward to watching this as i am on the treadmill in the mornings but it would not work, i tried cleaning the dvd and my husband also tried to get it to work but it refuses. i will try and find one in a store around town.",1394064000,,235,3.72
8455724,5,B0053U80KY,I love the Virtual Active DVD's. I like that they give you the option to work out to a guide or without one. Love the opportunity to travel the world right from my treadmill. This one is spectacular!,1388707200,,199,4.2631578947368425
8455725,5,B0053U80KY,"Great scenery - very enjoyable to walk to.  As mentioned, I had back surgery and the MD told me to walk as much as possible.  Thanks to this DVD and the others I purchased, it helped make my treadmill and elliptical a little more bearable.  I had the surgery in January and live in PA - so walking outside with ice, weather, etc. wasn't an option.  Thanks for the fast shipping also.",1368489600,,383,4.277777777777778
8455726,5,B0053U80KY,"This is my favorite virtual fitness DVD. It's a virtual hike but I actually jog to it. The camera movement is smooth and keeps going at a fast enough pace that it's really more like jogging than hiking.  Seeing the other people is also interesting - so the time passes by.

Johnny is a great motivator and seems to say the perfect thing at just the right time. I also enjoyed the sound track which matches the hike perfectly.

I look forward to more DVDs from the series.",1332115200,2,471,4.329545454545454
8455727,5,B0053U80KY,This is the first of many videos I will buy from this company.  High definition and superb photography.  My time on the treadmill flew by as I took a brisk hike through the beautiful German forests.  Buy this video.  You will not be disappointed!,1315872000,2,246,4.5227272727272725
