3105183,5,B0013DZNAA,"Crossing Jordan is one of the few series that was ended while it still had stories to tell.  The early seasons developed complex characters with complex relationships and the stories kept you engrossed.  Sadly, the show seemed to have fallen off its Network's radar in the last two seasons and ended with a disappointing episode. The cast was amazing and their characters deserved a better closing.",1203206400,45,398,5.015151515151516

They changed the music after the first season so the show did not have the same irish feel. Can't wait to see the rest of the seasons make it here as well.",1202860800,8,479,6.0588235294117645
3105185,5,B0013DZNAA,"Crossing Jordan was one of the most amazing shows that NBC forgot. With a fantastic, quirky ensemble cast, and a strong female lead, the show was a fantastic mix of crime solving and human character. Jordan Cavanaugh is a driven, passionate individual who goes above and beyond the call of duty to speak and act on behalf of the dead. She gives of herself, sometimes at great cost, to go the extra mile to solve the crime.

The show started in 2001, and it took this long to release Season 1 on DVD. I'm looking forward to the release of Seasons 2-6.",1202774400,14,550,4.392156862745098

3105192,2,B0013DZNAA,"I love this TV show, and I am sadly disappointed in this product. Disc two came out of the sealed package with multiple scratches and causes the disc to freeze, skip and finally stop playing.  The other discs seem to have no scratches.  Disc one played fine.  When I got to the 2nd one, I decided to return the set.  I hope I am able to get another set.  I was not given the choice of ""replacement"" when I went to return this product.

3105196,5,B0013DZNAA,"EVERYTHING about this series is excellent...ALL the actors, the sound and set designers,  plus details captured by the camera move the story in exciting ways.

3105198,4,B0013DZNAA,"I have all six seasons of this series, 2-6 are bootlegged copies. So explain to me how a program that was popular enough to run for six seasons only has season 1 available on DVD. The show got off to a slow start in season 1 but after about five or six episodes it finally decided were the storyline was to go and it took off. Liked the storyline and the characters through all six seasons.",1440979200,4,390,4.144736842105263

3105207,5,B0013DZNAA,"Jill is intense and her interaction with her screen ex-cop dad (once white shadow Ken Howard) in recreating crimes is exciting and unique in a genre flooded with female crime fighters.
The music adds to the intensity of the narratives but at a cost. Rumor has it that the reason  Jordan has only one season on dvd is because of unsigned musical copyrights.
Even so this first season is watchable and re watchable which for an American police drama.",1422576000,,448,4.670886075949367

3105214,5,B0013DZNAA,Would really like to know why we are only limited to the first season. Just as I finish watching season one I am wanting to watch the rest of them. This show was fresh and fun and the chemistry of Woody and Jordan got better with time. All the characters evolved and you can't help but get excited for the next show. I've watched this so many times and I need more!!! I'm sure I'm not alone on this.,1414713600,2,399,4.063291139240507

3105220,5,B0013DZNAA,"I forgot how great this show was, until I purchased this DVD set of Season One. Jill Hennessy is obviously the star of the show, but surrounded by a great cast, with their own story lines. NBC needs to release the other seasons on DVD. With over 80,000 people who ""Like"" the Show's Facebook page, I know it will sell. I mean, even if half of those buy them on DVD, that's a fair chunk of change. Come on NBC, do the right thing. You know it makes sense.",1402185600,3,453,4.101123595505618
3105221,5,B0013DZNAA,"I enjoyed it as much, if not more, than when the series was on.  My only complaint is that the way the page was worded on Amazon  lead me to believe that the whole series was available.  It's not.  I won't try of the sites that claim to have all the episodes.  I just don't trust them--if Amazon doesn't carry the series then the other sites are suspect.",1400803200,,354,4.147058823529412
3105222,5,B0013DZNAA,"I ordered ""Crossing Jordan"" season 1 recently because of the forensic pathologist stories (my favourites) and was hooked immediately. I never watched it because I do not remember it was ever showed in France.
Of course, I see the subject was copied later by the writers of ""Body of proof"" or ""Rizzoli and Isles"", a medical examiner helping solve homicides, both series being also very good. Because the season 1 was done in 2001, it is ""refreshing"" to notice the actors have not yet their teeths redone and white as snow (see the actresses in ""Greys anatomy"" or any other show nowadays).
I loved all the episodes, the plots, the actors, their interacting and now I am hooked and frustrated because for the comments I just read, no other season has been releases and is for sale.
If I had known that, I would have never ordered season one. Amazon should make a note.",1398211200,5,865,4.623376623376624
3105223,5,B0013DZNAA,"It was one of the saddest days of my life when Crossing Jordan was cancelled as it was one of the best dramas on television. It was spooky , funny and packed with a first rate cast that made the show such a pleasure to watch and some episodes kept you on the edge of your seat until the killer was revealed and usually someone you least expected was the culprit. Jordan was beautiful, sexy and a little on the wild side but she knew how to ferret out the killer and could worm herself out of trouble every time. I am one of many who loved the show and hope that more seasons will be forth coming soon. We can only hope someone hears our pleas and gives us more of Crossing Jordan. PLEASE.",1397260800,2,688,4.103703703703704
3105224,5,B0013DZNAA,"Oh my goodness, this show was way before it's time.  I almost called in sick so I could stay home and do a Crossing Jordan marathon.  Now for the bad news, this is the only season that is out on dvd.  I can't believe it, if I would have known that I would have waited to order.  I finished watching season one and now I want them all.  This was a great show, they should have kept it on for a lot longer.",1397174400,2,404,3.819277108433735
3105225,5,B0013DZNAA,"I never saw this when it was on TV, but a friend loaned me Season 1 and I'm Hooked.  So far I have only seen Season 1, but I found the entire set available from iOffer and was surprised to find that the payments were routed through the AMAZON PAYMENTS.  Hopefully the set will come this week and I will update this review when I know more.",1394496000,,339,4.044776119402985
3105226,5,B0013DZNAA,"I was really bummed when this show was canceled. Jordan and the crew were the highlight of my primetime obsession. I really hope to get the other seasons as well to complete my collection, but I can't seem to find them anywhere that i'm comfortable completing the transaction. I don't trust sites that I know nothing about. If you are a fan of this show, this is definitely a great thing to have.",1394064000,5,396,4.438356164383562
3105227,5,B0013DZNAA,first started watching this show on netflix and decided I had to add it to my collection. I wish the other seasons were out on dvd.,1392681600,3,131,4.076923076923077

3105230,5,B0013DZNAA,My only wish for this series is that NBC releases the rest of the series. I can only watch so much of season one without wanting to see the rest.,1389398400,,145,3.8666666666666667
3105231,5,B0013DZNAA,Crossing Jordan was one of my favorites tv shows & I was very disappointed when it was canceled. I was happy to be able to buy it,1384992000,,129,3.814814814814815
3105232,2,B0013DZNAA,"This is Quincy without Jack Klugman, who carried with him a natural appeal and the halo effect of his long association with The Odd Couple, opposite Tony Randall. Somehow he made a pain in the neck bearable. Jill Hennessy, however, at least for me, never having seen her previously, has no such aura. She comes through as a woman immature to a high degree.  Let me clarify that, she appears to be an excellent actress whose clear humanity, mostly in her relationship to the always superior Ken Howard, never counterbalances the sheer self-obsessed egotism of the role written for her. Perhaps my own experience within organizations has made me impervious to the virtues of people who screw up everything they touch because it is always them involved not the needs of the organization, their way, their desires, and never mind the trouble they cause everyone else. With the rest of the roles in the show, I am sympathetic and willing to take the bitter with the better (Goodman Ace). The shows are built around the customarily brilliant rebel finding quick solutions, with the help of her Dad, the retired police officer. The sequence of problem raised to problem solved is no worse and no better than the many such exhibitions we have had over the years. Well, at any rate, I have pretty nearly all seasons of the show (which I did not see on TV) on disc, and am hoping she matures considerably before too many seasons go by.",1382918400,,1425,4.7
3105233,5,B0013DZNAA,A show I had no idea about but took a chance on. The lead lady works in the Boston ME's office where she had been fired years earlier. She wants to play cop as much as be am ME. Could get that from her dad who was a cop. Very enjoyable.,1382745600,,236,3.6470588235294117
3105234,5,B0013DZNAA,"The characters seem to spat but they really care and are protective of each other.. Dr Jordan Cavanaugh (Coroner); Max (her dad: retired police officer turned bar owner..ends up getting tangled with the Irish Mob); Dr. Macy (Jordan's boss whose  wife can not decide whether she should be his ex or not ); and receptionist intake -girl Lily ( into Goth;MADLY in love with Dr. Macy); Dr. 'Bug"" the ultimate entomologist; Trey the Coroner in training; Nigel the ultimate Coroner Technician; one police Detective  Woody Hoyt crazy for Jordan....somehow these very colorful polar opposite personalities find a way to work as a team to determine cause of death and solve the crime.
Death and murder are dark subjects yet these characters make you feel, think but will  ALWAYS manage to make you laugh and maybe forget how stressful your day had been.
Want a drug-free; trip? Check it out. This DVD is not for prudes (by-the-way). Keep Smiling.",1381017600,,937,4.917721518987341
3105235,5,B0013DZNAA,"I love this show. Season 1 takes a little time to hit it's stride (too much sexy, tormented Jordan, too little Nigel and Bug.) But once the writers figure out what they've got and  go for it, the show finds the perfect balance between drama and farce.( I suspect it served as an inspiration to such quirky character driven csi-type shows as ""NCIS"" and ""Bones""). Anyway, five stars and I hope the release the other seasons.",1379635200,2,422,4.552631578947368
3105236,5,B0013DZNAA,Loved the DVD.  Can't wait for the other seasons! Just as I remembered this show back when I first started watching it.,1378944000,,119,4.409090909090909
3105237,5,B0013DZNAA,This used to be one of my favorite shows...hated when it went of the air. Love that I can share it with my friends.,1377561600,,115,3.8333333333333335
3105238,5,B0013DZNAA,Jill Hennessy's first outing following her years on Law and Order was a great show.  We can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be available.,1375488000,2,143,4.296296296296297
3105239,3,B0013DZNAA,"There are plenty of good actors and good performances in ""Crossing Jordan"", but for some reason Hennessy's failings just become worse over the first season. She seems desperate to keep viewer's attention by incessantly changing expressions, postures, and moods. There are a couple earlier episodes where she's bobbing up and down for no reason: it appears she needs to go to the ladies', or that she's high on amphetamines. Add that to her unblinking, wide-eyed stare, and you have someone you wouldn't want to talk with any longer than necessary.",1372982400,,547,5.088888888888889

3105244,4,B0013DZNAA,"I have found that I loved watching several TV shows that I hated on TV.  Once I was able to watch the shows without tedious commercial interruptions and have the freedom to watch episodes one after the other insteading of waiting for next week, the plots and character development could stand out.  This specific series is really well written:  interesting plots and intelligent characters.  I bought this as a present for someone who doesn't use streaming online.",1367971200,,464,4.987012987012987
3105245,3,B0013DZNAA,"Over all this show has a ""Halloweenish"" feel to it.

It is an OK show as far as the stories go. But as it progresses, there are more and more scenes of really gross and gruesome dead bodies on the autopsy table, horrid looking corpses in various degrees of decay and other really yucky scenes of maggots eating corpses etc. I feel grossed out that these images are forever stored in my mind. I don't see that it is necessary for the stories to show these scenes, it will be possible to just make a suggestion of them without actually showing us all these gruesome images.

And the fact that the women doctors in the medical examiner office who deal with these corpses are as gorgeous as super models, makes the show even more bizarre.",1364515200,,734,4.42962962962963

3105248,5,B0013DZNAA,"If you like crime/cop series, you'll love Crossing Jordan!  A top notch corner, tormented by the ghosts of her past, who fancies herself a detective.  If you like shows such as NCIS, Criminal Minds, Bones, etc.  You'll love this show.",1361232000,,234,4.8
3105249,5,B0013DZNAA,"I have been waiting a long time for this series to be released on DVD. The wait is well worth it. This series sets up the character of Jordan, you either like her or loathe her. She has anger issues relating to her mother's death some years before the series starts. How she handles these issues,how she relates to the people around her and the scrapes she gets herself into, form the basis of this series.

3105255,5,B0013DZNAA,"I bought season 1 a couple of years ago, and I didn't notice where it was being shipped from - China.  I didn't receive the usual good quality programming that I expected.  What I received was poor quality DVDs made from bad copies off a TV set.  complete with commercials and lots of pixelation.  I liked this show enough to buy the first season again.  Ken Howaqrd as Jordan's father was a perfect choice, and the little acting-out game that they played to get into the minds of the perps was a great touch.  The show really came together when Jerry O'Connell was added to the cast.  Jordan is a Quincy style medical examiner who takes the extra step to solve the murders that show up onn her table, and Jerry is the perfect policeman to help her do it.",1354838400,,755,4.35

3105259,5,B0013DZNAA,I greatly enjoyed getting to relive Jordan's return to the scene of the crime. The cast is exceptional and the story are strong. I really enjoy the music tracks that have been woven into the episodes. I wouldn't be surprised that the choice of quality tracks has actually held up the release of the other seasons. Please release them and let us reward you by allowing to open our wallets. Either a physical distribution or at least an electronic streaming version on Amazon Prime.

3105261,4,B0013DZNAA,"Wonderful, heartfelt show, with a great continuing mystery. Unlike some of the Law and Order shows, Crossing Jordan has more of an emotional investment in the characters on the show. You really get caught up in the story, along with the drama of the crime. I started watching it again, after the few yrs it was off the air. Love Jordan, and the characters.

But if you are like me you watch full seasons of shows on Netflix, but sometimes the story arc gets confused. Well with CJ, it's a mess. NBC aired the episodes in the wrong order, so the story makes no sense. If you try and find the episode guide online, it still is in bad shape. I have corrected the order in which the episodes were suppose to air. Follow the names of the episodes and the production numbers, NOT the episode numbers.

3105263,5,B0013DZNAA,"I loved this series! It was the pre-House House. I just hope that Universal doesn't
pull a Sliders and only release a few seasons. It doesn't matter if the last
season or two was not the best or not. I believe that if you
are going to release a series, you should release the ENTIRE series. But, that is Universal for you!",1313280000,,322,4.209677419354839
3105264,5,B0013DZNAA,"Glad to see this one released on DVD. I sort of lost track of the series and was only able to catch a couple episodes here and there as time permitted over the years. I heard the Last episode of the Series Finale wasn't that good? Sounds like another great show cut to make room for more Reality Crap. *Sighs* Heres hoping the rest of the show gets released to DVD eventually and doesnt get hung up in 'negotiations' like many other shows have been hi-jacked to the DVD release process: ""Yes I let you use my Music/Face/Voice/Name for TV, but I don't want it on DVD."" *rolls eyes* I Never did understand that mentality. Ive seen shows and Movies and Loved the soundtracks and have gone out to buy them or purchased them from Amazon, and have looked/bought other stuff for the actors/actresses that Ive seen in the various shows, so whats the difference in them being seen/heard on TV and yet not on DVD/BluRay/or even VHS Tape? Then again the economy is in the toilet so people need every little bit they can get I guess. Anyway thats just my own oppinion. I am looking forward to the rest of the series being released regardless. The cast/crew were great!

Take care everyone, Peace.",1309737600,,1184,4.506976744186047

3105271,5,B0013DZNAA,"I loved this tv show when it was on several years ago.  I have started buying the seasons and of course started with season 1.  There are so many crime dramas on now, but this was one of the first about the city's Medical Examiner's office in Boston.  The other actors add so much fun to the cast.  It is a great show and I wish it hadn't been cancelled.",1288310400,,354,4.014285714285714

3105273,5,B0013DZNAA,"I just ordered Season 1. Crossing Jordan was my favorite show; I used to watch NBC exclusively, and it was with the demise of this show and others that made me switch to CBS. Jill Hennessey was perfect; Jordan became a friend, someone I truly cared about. She is smart, wise-cracking, self-depricating, has many flaws, amusing, and often weak and foolish in her decisions...someone I can relate to. The very fine Miguel Ferrer was given a chance to prove his worth; I don't think his immense talent has been put to such good use as here. I look forward to watching these episodes again, and hope the other seasons will be available soon. It was a fun ride. Jordan Cavanaugh is not to be written off as just another detective-type. She is complicated and interesting. Adorable, too. Idiot moves like cancelling this series (and many others) can qualify NBC's demise as a leader in programming.",1283558400,4,892,4.7612903225806456

3105275,5,B0013DZNAA,"Crossing Jordan ist the best serie ever and the only one I ever cared for. I will never unterstand why NBC cancelled it.

I was delighted when Season 1 was finally released on DVD in 2008 and ordered it right away from Amazon.com.
Later I also bought the French and the German version. Since then I have been waiting desparately for season 2 to 6
to be released, why this hold-up? Heroes, also created by Tim Kring, came out on DVD right after its broadcast on TV
 and does not have half as many fans as Crossing Jordan (at least not in Europe).

Please Amazon can't you  do something about it? I would be forever thankful.",1266105600,5,623,4.344827586206897

3105277,5,B0013DZNAA,"First of all, let me say that 'Crossing Jordan' was one of the shows that I never missed.  It was just that good and I am still royally peeved at NBC for canceling it without even a heads up!!!  They left us all hanging and anxiously waiting for the new season to arrive and then bam!! it was cancelled.  So boooo to NBC forever for that.  Now on to how great this show is, I liked averything about this show, the science, the drama, the comedic spots that were woven into it.  Each actor was brilliant in their role and I really miss them alot.  I don't really like to get up at 5 a.m. to watch reruns on A&E, so I at least have the first season on dvd to watch anytime.  My next beef is when are the rest of the seasons going to be released??  I think we fans have been more than reasonably patient about waiting for at least the second season to arrive, but this is getting ridiculous.  Give us any word, please.  Amazon, you are a saviour, it is not easy to find certain dvd sets that I want in my area, and the nearest large department store is over two hours away, so you have excellent quality products and at a really nice price too.  Shipping is great too, I was really pleased with this purchase and watch it regularly.",1265414400,4,1229,4.143459915611814
3105278,5,B0013DZNAA,"CROSSING JORDAN is my favorite Television Program ever.  The fact that it takes place in a morgue is not depressing because the story and the characters are so interesting.  All of the Actors are great. This first Season featured Jordan talking to her Father and speculating on how crimes were committed as he was a retired Police man who ran a bar.  I don't know what happened with NBC because the last show of the seasons did not match up to the beginning of the next season.  A lot of questions were never answered during the whole series. Nevertheless, each season was great. NBC made a mistake in cancelling this show.  Jay Leno could not compete with it.  It was surely one of the best shows on TV ever, and we are waiting for more DVDs of the ensuing seasons.",1265068800,3,766,4.435714285714286
3105279,5,B0013DZNAA,"I was thrilled to get the 1st Season and promptly sat down and went through the whole set that evening. I was looking forward to more Seasons, and was therefore delighted when a company named Global DVD....something or another offered me the entire Crossing Jordan series for $140. I jumped on it after reviewing their website and finding no reason to not trust they could produce. It appeared that even after several years off the air except for re-runs NBC is NOT releasing the rest of the seasons, which is sheer stupidity. But I degress; NOW the fun begins:
(1) my local postman knocked on my door about 15 days later and handed me the claim ticket for something we had received from KUWAIT as it had to be opened in the presence of a federal officer and I would have to go down to the post office to make an appointment with said officer through the postmaster at that branch. And, by the way-I would need I was totally bewildered as to WHAT this package was.
(2) An appt was arranged for the next afternoon, whertrein I met the branch postmaster, the FBI branch manager and a member of the local police. The bomb dog had already proved the package safe, and the federal government was primarily there for my safety (or so they said),she actually seemed to be a greatt person-even with this idiotic issue at hand.
(3) Imagine our collective suprise when (yes,Virginia there IS a Santa Clause)16 DVD's spilt out, all with the picture of Hennesay that's on the front of Season 1 DVD. No Disc info identifying WHICH episodes were on which DVD's no play list- nopthing. The federal agent took them, with my heartfelt thanks-I can assure you. The agent called me back the next day, telling me they were clean of any subversive information, but assuring me I would likely want to throw them away. Curious, I went on and picked them up; sure enough the clarity was wretched, the sound very poor, it looked as though the characters were in a fog, and every 5 minutes or so, just for the hell of it, the characters would begin jerking and speaking another language!
(4) Upon calling this company's so called Customer Service, no one was available who spoke English! I took them back to the post office and discovered it would cost me over 40 dollars to send it back.
I tossed them in a recycling bin for CDs and considerd this a lesson well learned.",1262304000,26,2345,4.533018867924528

3105282,5,B0013DZNAA,"In Crossing Jordan: Season 1, the audience is introduced to Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh and her quirky, crime-solving team of co-workers at the Boston morgue.  With each new body comes hidden secrets and plot intrigue.  Follow the team as they uncover the truths behind each new corpse that rolls into the cooler.  If you are already a crime buff, then you will love to listen to the stories and unravel the clues yourself to put each piece of the puzzle together.

As a medical examiner Jill's character determines cause of death- but she goes the extra mile in the difficult cases to actually solve the crimes (which creates friction with the police department).

At times funny, dramatic, and sad, with some family drama underneath..you are sure to enjoy this series.

Highly Recommended.",1228089600,3,456,5.579710144927536
3105287,5,B0013DZNAA,"Crossing Jordan was, and stil is an amazing show.  But the thing that made the show really stand out for me was that all the ators were absolutely amazing!!! I also love the fact that all of the actors weren""t drop-dead gorgeous. This fact made the show more relatable to the audience.

My favorite characters are Steve Valentine's ""Nigel"" and Ravi Kapoor's ""Bug"".  The reason  I enjoy them is because they're both so quirky, and different.

Another thing I liked was the fact that each actor was give their chance to shine in a particular episode.  Miguel Farrer was mesmerizing as Dr. Garett Macy.

It also seemed like all the actors really cared about each other. it also seemed like they weren't trying to up-stage one another, they felt like a cohesive group.  and that's what made the show a hit.

This show is great for anyone who likes crime dramas.  It is also very character driven which makes it extremely unique (unlike the CSI franchise.)",1212624000,3,303,4.454545454545454
3105291,4,B0013DZNAA,"I actually discover Jordan on DVD .Having ""withdrawal symptoms"" at the end of season 2 of Bones on DVD,I searched Amazon for something similar and found this series. I wasn't disappointed,although it took a while before ""total suspension of disbelief"" works. I had to sit thru something like 6 episodes before stopping the comparison to ""Bones""and enjoying it on its own terms. I will list briefly the good and bad points I found:
The good :
As many other reviewers have pointed out,great ensemble cast,good chemistry between the main characters,clever story lines. Very creative mix of hilarity and darkness.""Bones"" took a lot from this show.
The bad:
At least for the first few episodes,I had a problem with the main character:Ms Hennessy is way too much of a looker,she struts around looking more like a model from a fashion catalogue. The rest of the cast are either plain ,quirky and foreign,deliberately so in order to make her stand out even more. We hardly see her  actually doing her job ,you know wearing a lab coat,cutting flesh at the operating table,mouthing long incomprehensible medical terms etc..Instead,I get to see her meddling with the cops'work uninvited,the motivations being really contrived at times.
The ""profiling"" scenes while fascinating at first,soon become formulaic and repetitive,especially when I view two episodes in a row .
Conclusion:
I enjoyed watching this show,but it took a while before it becomes compulsive viewing. I feel slightly put off knowing beforehand that these characters won't find any closure as the show was axed at the end of season 6.
So :Reccommended viewing,but patience is required.",1212105600,5,1641,5.169172932330827

3105293,5,B0013DZNAA,"I enjoy mysteries, that is what drew me to ""Crossing Jordan"". What kept me returning to each episode was watching the development of each of the characters, and thier interactions with each other in the workplace, the Coroner's Offices for the City of Boston. Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh (played expertly, by Jill Hennessy) lost her mother when she was ten years old, her mother was murdered, and the killer was never found. As you can probably guess by this statement, Jordan still has nightmares, anger issues, and a few other emotional issues. She delves deeper than she should into murder cases, making very interesting episodes!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossing-Jordan-Season-1/dp/B0013DZNAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossing Jordan: Season 1</a>",1211673600,2,791,6.2
3105294,5,B0013DZNAA,"It took some time for this show to find its footing and decide exactly what it wanted to be. Many expecting it to be very dark like ""Profiler"" or intricately technical like ""C.S.I."" gave up on it too soon. The pilot episode offered a lot of background and insight into Jordan Cavanaugh (Jill Hennessey). She was smart and pretty, and terribly messed up, haunted by demons from her childhood. She was also relentless in her pursuit of justice.

Once she left L.A. for Boston, joining the M.E.'s office, she gradually found a home. By the middle of season one, the show knew what it was and many were glad they'd hung around. It became this wonderfully cool show about a small group of people in the medical examiner's office, Jill Hennessy at its center, who had formed a kind of familial bond as they dealt with crimes and their personal problems. In Jordan's case, who was searching for her mother's killer, the two often intertwined.

There was a lot of quirky humor and fun mixed in with the darker elements, making for a great show. There was also a fine ensemble cast. Miguel Ferrer as Jordan's boss, Katherine Hahn as the always ""glass half full"" Lily, and Jerry O'Connell as Woody, the cop often at odds with Jordan, but sort of loving every minute of it, all brought something to the show's dynamic. Ken Howard was also good as Jordan's estranged father. But it was really Steve Valentine's Nigel and Ravi Kapoor's ""Bug"" and their interactions with Jordan which made the show special.

They bickered, got in trouble, covered for each other, and generally had a life and a family thanks to each other. Crossing Jordan really hit its stride with the two-part ""Digger"" story arc. It cemented the show to its core audience, who stayed from then on. Followed by the very good ""Blue Christmas"" episode, it had finally discovered the perfect mix of crime and quirky humor and personal woes. It was both the dark and the light.

One of the great things about the show was the music. An eclectic mix of songs was often used for atmosphere, which could run from noir to hilarity in less time than it took to make a fun reference to Elvis. From the middle of season one to the end of season two, this was great television. You could never put it in in a nice little box, pegging it as this kind of show or that. It was simply Crossing Jordan.

Here are the episodes for season one:  Pilot, The Dawn of a New Day, The Ties That Bind, Born to Run, You Can't Go Home Again, Believers, Digger, Part I, Digger, Part II, Blue Christmas, Wrong Place, Wrong Time, Blood Relatives, Miracles & Wonders, Four Fathers, Acts of Mercy, Lost and Found, Crime & Punishment, With Honor, For Harry, with Love and Squalor, The Gift of Life, Someone to Count On, Secrets & Lies, Secrets & Lies, Part II

With everything on television seeming the same, Crossing Jordan was different. Many episodes and story lines were interconnected. You never got the full story from just occasionally tuning in for a peak. It required some attention and time. It was what made the show work, and its downfall in later seasons when it tried to fit in more. Seasons one and two were terrific, however, and something a bit different for TV fans to own.",1211673600,43,3211,4.564236111111111
3105295,5,B0013DZNAA,"As of now, I've only watched the first episode.

If you like medical/criminal shows (Bones, House, CSI, etc), I would recommend this show. Every other main character adds something to the mix - and to top it off, all the actors pretty good.

I remember the first season of Bones, although I enjoyed the show, was a little stiff in the acting department. The main characters were good, but guest stars... eh, not so much.

Some of the styles seem dated, and the picture in the pilot episode seems a little off (could be my TV...), but the story is there and its good.

It was so fascinating that I wanted to be a medical examiner until I saw some pictures of an autopsy online. Which made me quickly change my mind. I loved the show so much and was very disappointed when I found out that the show was canceled. I really wish that Crossing Jordan had never been taken off the air because the show had so many places to go with Jordan and Woody. My only Crossing Jordan fix is when I watch it on A&E and now the DVDs. However, I have one problem.

3105306,5,B0013DZNAA,"Wow...this was a long time coming!

This was one show that NBC truly made a mistake with in its abysmal decision not to return Crossing Jordan for a seventh season. Unlike shows that stay on well past their prime, Crossing Jordan was still in full swing and had a myriad of stories left to tell such as who killed Emily (Jordan's Mom), where did Max disappear to and why (Jordan's Dad), what was Dr. Macy's ""demon,"" would Jordan and Woody finally get together and so much more.

Crossing Jordan was an awesome television show on the NBC network. It lasted for six sesons and 116 episodes.
Season one was a ground breaker in that it showed a female lead (Jill Hennessy) who was strong, smart, independent, beautiful, vulnerable yet willing to take risks to find the truth. Jill played the character of Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh with such aplomb, realism and strength that I was hooked after viewing the premiere episode. In fact, I never missed an episode in six years!

A part of what made Crossing Jordan such a great show was the fantastic acting of its unconventional cast and the coolest music ever by Wendy and Lisa. You could not view an episode of Crossing Jordan without stopping by Best Buy the following day to pick up a CD or two of the songs heard on the show.

The writing was second to none. There were no gimmicks. You were able to watch the characaters grow and evolve. Their weaknesses and vulnerabilities were shown and this only caused the viewer to draw even closer to each of the characters. No character grabbed a hold of you like Jordan! Jill nailed the role each and every week!

Crossing Jordan truly ended way before it should have but thank goodness the network at least had the foresight to release the show on DVD.

Do yourself a favor and purchase season one. You will not be disappointed. In fact, it will leave you begging NBC to hurry and release the remaining seasons ASAP.

I have ordered my set.

Happy CJ viewing!

3339723,5,B0013DZNAA,"I was really bummed when this show was canceled. Jordan and the crew were the highlight of my primetime obsession. I really hope to get the other seasons as well to complete my collection, but I can't seem to find them anywhere that i'm comfortable completing the transaction. I don't trust sites that I know nothing about. If you are a fan of this show, this is definitely a great thing to have.",1394064000,5,396,4.438356164383562
3339724,5,B0013DZNAA,first started watching this show on netflix and decided I had to add it to my collection. I wish the other seasons were out on dvd.,1392681600,3,131,4.076923076923077
3339725,5,B0013DZNAA,Looking forward to the rest of the Seasons.  Wish they would release all the seasons in one complete set soon.,1391385600,2,110,4.5
3339726,5,B0013DZNAA,"Get it together and put the rest out. I read it's because of the music? I like the music, but i wan't the rest of the series .....so take it out i guess.",1390435200,2,153,3.6666666666666665
3339727,5,B0013DZNAA,My only wish for this series is that NBC releases the rest of the series. I can only watch so much of season one without wanting to see the rest.,1389398400,,145,3.8666666666666667
3339728,5,B0013DZNAA,Crossing Jordan was one of my favorites tv shows & I was very disappointed when it was canceled. I was happy to be able to buy it,1384992000,,129,3.814814814814815
3339729,2,B0013DZNAA,"This is Quincy without Jack Klugman, who carried with him a natural appeal and the halo effect of his long association with The Odd Couple, opposite Tony Randall. Somehow he made a pain in the neck bearable. Jill Hennessy, however, at least for me, never having seen her previously, has no such aura. She comes through as a woman immature to a high degree.  Let me clarify that, she appears to be an excellent actress whose clear humanity, mostly in her relationship to the always superior Ken Howard, never counterbalances the sheer self-obsessed egotism of the role written for her. Perhaps my own experience within organizations has made me impervious to the virtues of people who screw up everything they touch because it is always them involved not the needs of the organization, their way, their desires, and never mind the trouble they cause everyone else. With the rest of the roles in the show, I am sympathetic and willing to take the bitter with the better (Goodman Ace). The shows are built around the customarily brilliant rebel finding quick solutions, with the help of her Dad, the retired police officer. The sequence of problem raised to problem solved is no worse and no better than the many such exhibitions we have had over the years. Well, at any rate, I have pretty nearly all seasons of the show (which I did not see on TV) on disc, and am hoping she matures considerably before too many seasons go by.",1382918400,,1425,4.7
3339730,5,B0013DZNAA,A show I had no idea about but took a chance on. The lead lady works in the Boston ME's office where she had been fired years earlier. She wants to play cop as much as be am ME. Could get that from her dad who was a cop. Very enjoyable.,1382745600,,236,3.6470588235294117
3339731,5,B0013DZNAA,"The characters seem to spat but they really care and are protective of each other.. Dr Jordan Cavanaugh (Coroner); Max (her dad: retired police officer turned bar owner..ends up getting tangled with the Irish Mob); Dr. Macy (Jordan's boss whose  wife can not decide whether she should be his ex or not ); and receptionist intake -girl Lily ( into Goth;MADLY in love with Dr. Macy); Dr. 'Bug"" the ultimate entomologist; Trey the Coroner in training; Nigel the ultimate Coroner Technician; one police Detective  Woody Hoyt crazy for Jordan....somehow these very colorful polar opposite personalities find a way to work as a team to determine cause of death and solve the crime.
Death and murder are dark subjects yet these characters make you feel, think but will  ALWAYS manage to make you laugh and maybe forget how stressful your day had been.
Want a drug-free; trip? Check it out. This DVD is not for prudes (by-the-way). Keep Smiling.",1381017600,,937,4.917721518987341
3339732,5,B0013DZNAA,"I love this show. Season 1 takes a little time to hit it's stride (too much sexy, tormented Jordan, too little Nigel and Bug.) But once the writers figure out what they've got and  go for it, the show finds the perfect balance between drama and farce.( I suspect it served as an inspiration to such quirky character driven csi-type shows as ""NCIS"" and ""Bones""). Anyway, five stars and I hope the release the other seasons.",1379635200,2,422,4.552631578947368
3339733,5,B0013DZNAA,Loved the DVD.  Can't wait for the other seasons! Just as I remembered this show back when I first started watching it.,1378944000,,119,4.409090909090909
3339734,5,B0013DZNAA,This used to be one of my favorite shows...hated when it went of the air. Love that I can share it with my friends.,1377561600,,115,3.8333333333333335
3339735,5,B0013DZNAA,Jill Hennessy's first outing following her years on Law and Order was a great show.  We can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be available.,1375488000,2,143,4.296296296296297
3339736,3,B0013DZNAA,"There are plenty of good actors and good performances in ""Crossing Jordan"", but for some reason Hennessy's failings just become worse over the first season. She seems desperate to keep viewer's attention by incessantly changing expressions, postures, and moods. There are a couple earlier episodes where she's bobbing up and down for no reason: it appears she needs to go to the ladies', or that she's high on amphetamines. Add that to her unblinking, wide-eyed stare, and you have someone you wouldn't want to talk with any longer than necessary.",1372982400,,547,5.088888888888889
3339737,5,B0013DZNAA,I got this first season because I used to watch the show when it was on and remember liking it....I still do.,1371427200,,109,4.0
3339738,5,B0013DZNAA,We were so thrilled to be able to get the first season of this series. Cant wait for season 2.,1371340800,3,94,3.75
3339739,4,B0013DZNAA,"This is a terrific ME show, beautifully cast and acted. Just a shame that only one season has come out on DVD. There should be more.",1370131200,,132,4.115384615384615
3339740,5,B0013DZNAA,I love strong female characters like Jordan.  Lots of quirky characters and good forensic science without being gross about it.  Wish they had more seasons on DVD.,1368057600,2,163,5.0
3339741,4,B0013DZNAA,"I have found that I loved watching several TV shows that I hated on TV.  Once I was able to watch the shows without tedious commercial interruptions and have the freedom to watch episodes one after the other insteading of waiting for next week, the plots and character development could stand out.  This specific series is really well written:  interesting plots and intelligent characters.  I bought this as a present for someone who doesn't use streaming online.",1367971200,,464,4.987012987012987
3339742,3,B0013DZNAA,"Over all this show has a ""Halloweenish"" feel to it.

It is an OK show as far as the stories go. But as it progresses, there are more and more scenes of really gross and gruesome dead bodies on the autopsy table, horrid looking corpses in various degrees of decay and other really yucky scenes of maggots eating corpses etc. I feel grossed out that these images are forever stored in my mind. I don't see that it is necessary for the stories to show these scenes, it will be possible to just make a suggestion of them without actually showing us all these gruesome images.

And the fact that the women doctors in the medical examiner office who deal with these corpses are as gorgeous as super models, makes the show even more bizarre.",1364515200,,734,4.42962962962963
3339743,5,B0013DZNAA,"The original C.S.I.. In some ways even better. Can't wait to get the rest on DVD, as soon as they come out on DVD.",1364256000,2,114,3.7916666666666665
3339744,5,B0013DZNAA,I would recommend to all who ask about it I wish them would do the rest of the seasons love it when it was on,1363564800,2,109,3.4
3339745,5,B0013DZNAA,"If you like crime/cop series, you'll love Crossing Jordan!  A top notch corner, tormented by the ghosts of her past, who fancies herself a detective.  If you like shows such as NCIS, Criminal Minds, Bones, etc.  You'll love this show.",1361232000,,234,4.8
3339746,5,B0013DZNAA,"I have been waiting a long time for this series to be released on DVD. The wait is well worth it. This series sets up the character of Jordan, you either like her or loathe her. She has anger issues relating to her mother's death some years before the series starts. How she handles these issues,how she relates to the people around her and the scrapes she gets herself into, form the basis of this series. Once I had watched the pilot,I just had to watch all of the episodes one after the other. I can't wait for the next series to be released.",1360281600,4,545,4.25
3339747,4,B0013DZNAA,I have watched this in the past and I've like it. Just wanted to add to my library. This is still part of a medical drama.,1360108800,,122,3.730769230769231
3339748,5,B0013DZNAA,This season is great!  I can't wait for the other seasons to be released!!  Good acting and entertaining!  Very enjoyable!,1359504000,,122,5.0
3339749,5,B0013DZNAA,"I did not watch Crossing Jordan when it ran on primetime but watch it when it was syndicated on Criminal Investigation Network  (CI)

Loved the characters and the story lines.  I liked this series because the characters were not perfect and had real issues like everyone else.

CI is no longer showing this wonderful series so I am waiting for the release of the other 5 seasons.",1358553600,,379,4.611940298507463
3339750,5,B0013DZNAA,A show with one of the most beautiful woman on the world. I really really enjoyed this show. It was like visiting an old friend each week. Sorry it is off. I hope they release the rest of the shows too.,1358553600,,202,3.951219512195122
3339751,5,B0013DZNAA,Crossing Jordan was one of my favorite shows on television.  I was quite delighted when I was able to find this outstanding drama. I have watched the dvds a few times. I absolutely love this show.,1358121600,2,196,4.444444444444445
3339752,5,B0013DZNAA,"I bought season 1 a couple of years ago, and I didn't notice where it was being shipped from - China.  I didn't receive the usual good quality programming that I expected.  What I received was poor quality DVDs made from bad copies off a TV set.  complete with commercials and lots of pixelation.  I liked this show enough to buy the first season again.  Ken Howaqrd as Jordan's father was a perfect choice, and the little acting-out game that they played to get into the minds of the perps was a great touch.  The show really came together when Jerry O'Connell was added to the cast.  Jordan is a Quincy style medical examiner who takes the extra step to solve the murders that show up onn her table, and Jerry is the perfect policeman to help her do it.",1354838400,,755,4.35
3339753,5,B0013DZNAA,i love this show even when it was on tv i loved to watch it. i just wish seasons 2 thru 6 would hurry up and come out on dvd so i can order them also,1354752000,,149,3.1666666666666665
3339754,5,B0013DZNAA,I loved it and I really wish you had all the seasons to buy.  I can't wait to see the other seasons.,1350950400,3,100,3.5454545454545454
3339755,5,B0013DZNAA,"This DVD series comes in five discs, shrink wrapped, and brand new. This is one of the best crime shows ever on television. Unfortunately, the powers that be will not release Seasons 2-6 on DVD even though there would be a huge customer response.",1342656000,3,246,4.613636363636363
3339756,5,B0013DZNAA,I greatly enjoyed getting to relive Jordan's return to the scene of the crime. The cast is exceptional and the story are strong. I really enjoy the music tracks that have been woven into the episodes. I wouldn't be surprised that the choice of quality tracks has actually held up the release of the other seasons. Please release them and let us reward you by allowing to open our wallets. Either a physical distribution or at least an electronic streaming version on Amazon Prime. Just keep them coming.,1341273600,3,503,4.7272727272727275
3339757,5,B0013DZNAA,"I do really hope that the all seasons of Crossing Jordan will soon be available on DVD.  This was a great show with an awesome cast, certainly much better than a lot of the junk TV being released today.",1337817600,,202,4.17948717948718
3339758,4,B0013DZNAA,"Wonderful, heartfelt show, with a great continuing mystery. Unlike some of the Law and Order shows, Crossing Jordan has more of an emotional investment in the characters on the show. You really get caught up in the story, along with the drama of the crime. I started watching it again, after the few yrs it was off the air. Love Jordan, and the characters.

But if you are like me you watch full seasons of shows on Netflix, but sometimes the story arc gets confused. Well with CJ, it's a mess. NBC aired the episodes in the wrong order, so the story makes no sense. If you try and find the episode guide online, it still is in bad shape. I have corrected the order in which the episodes were suppose to air. Follow the names of the episodes and the production numbers, NOT the episode numbers.

3339760,5,B0013DZNAA,"I loved this series! It was the pre-House House. I just hope that Universal doesn't
pull a Sliders and only release a few seasons. It doesn't matter if the last
season or two was not the best or not. I believe that if you
are going to release a series, you should release the ENTIRE series. But, that is Universal for you!",1313280000,,322,4.209677419354839

I heard the Last episode of the Series Finale wasn't that good? Sounds like another great show cut to make room for more Reality Crap. *Sighs* Heres hoping the rest of the show gets released to DVD eventually and doesnt get hung up in 'negotiations' like many other shows have been hi-jacked to the DVD release process: ""Yes I let you use my Music/Face/Voice/Name for TV, but I don't want it on DVD."" *rolls eyes* I Never did understand that mentality. Ive seen shows and Movies and Loved the soundtracks and have gone out to buy them or purchased them from Amazon, and have looked/bought other stuff for the actors/actresses that Ive seen in the various shows, so whats the difference in them being seen/heard on TV and yet not on DVD/BluRay/or even VHS Tape? Then again the economy is in the toilet so people need every little bit they can get I guess. Anyway thats just my own oppinion. I am looking forward to the rest of the series being released regardless. The cast/crew were great!

Jill Hennessey was perfect; Jordan became a friend, someone I truly cared about. She is smart, wise-cracking, self-depricating, has many flaws, amusing, and often weak and foolish in her decisions...someone I can relate to. The very fine Miguel Ferrer was given a chance to prove his worth; I don't think his immense talent has been put to such good use as here. I look forward to watching these episodes again, and hope the other seasons will be available soon. It was a fun ride. Jordan Cavanaugh is not to be written off as just another detective-type. She is complicated and interesting. Adorable, too. Idiot moves like cancelling this series (and many others) can qualify NBC's demise as a leader in programming.",1283558400,4,892,4.7612903225806456

It was just that good and I am still royally peeved at NBC for canceling it without even a heads up!!!  They left us all hanging and anxiously waiting for the new season to arrive and then bam!! it was cancelled.  So boooo to NBC forever for that.  Now on to how great this show is, I liked averything about this show, the science, the drama, the comedic spots that were woven into it.  Each actor was brilliant in their role and I really miss them alot.  I don't really like to get up at 5 a.m. to watch reruns on A&E, so I at least have the first season on dvd to watch anytime.  My next beef is when are the rest of the seasons going to be released??  I think we fans have been more than reasonably patient about waiting for at least the second season to arrive, but this is getting ridiculous.  Give us any word, please.  Amazon, you are a saviour, it is not easy to find certain dvd sets that I want in my area, and the nearest large department store is over two hours away, so you have excellent quality products and at a really nice price too.

All of the Actors are great. This first Season featured Jordan talking to her Father and speculating on how crimes were committed as he was a retired Police man who ran a bar.  I don't know what happened with NBC because the last show of the seasons did not match up to the beginning of the next season.  A lot of questions were never answered during the whole series. Nevertheless, each season was great. NBC made a mistake in cancelling this show.  Jay Leno could not compete with it.

3339776,5,B0013DZNAA,"I was thrilled to get the 1st Season and promptly sat down and went through the whole set that evening. I was looking forward to more Seasons, and was therefore delighted when a company named Global DVD....something or another offered me the entire Crossing Jordan series for $140. I jumped on it after reviewing their website and finding no reason to not trust they could produce. It appeared that even after several years off the air except for re-runs NBC is NOT releasing the rest of the seasons, which is sheer stupidity. But I degress; NOW the fun begins:
(1) my local postman knocked on my door about 15 days later and handed me the claim ticket for something we had received from KUWAIT as it had to be opened in the presence of a federal officer and I would have to go down to the post office to make an appointment with said officer through the postmaster at that branch. And, by the way-I would need I was totally bewildered as to WHAT this package was.
(2) An appt was arranged for the next afternoon, whertrein I met the branch postmaster, the FBI branch manager and a member of the local police. The bomb dog had already proved the package safe, and the federal government was primarily there for my safety (or so they said),she actually seemed to be a greatt person-even with this idiotic issue at hand.
(3) Imagine our collective suprise when (yes,Virginia there IS a Santa Clause)16 DVD's spilt out, all with the picture of Hennesay that's on the front of Season 1 DVD. No Disc info identifying WHICH episodes were on which DVD's no play list- nopthing. The federal agent took them, with my heartfelt thanks-I can assure you. The agent called me back the next day, telling me they were clean of any subversive information, but assuring me I would likely want to throw them away. Curious, I went on and picked them up; sure enough the clarity was wretched, the sound very poor, it looked as though the characters were in a fog, and every 5 minutes or so, just for the hell of it, the characters would begin jerking and speaking another language!
(4) Upon calling this company's so called Customer Service, no one was available who spoke English! I took them back to the post office and discovered it would cost me over 40 dollars to send it back.
I tossed them in a recycling bin for CDs and considerd this a lesson well learned.",1262304000,26,2345,4.533018867924528

I also love the fact that all of the actors weren""t drop-dead gorgeous. This fact made the show more relatable to the audience.

My favorite characters are Steve Valentine's ""Nigel"" and Ravi Kapoor's ""Bug"".  The reason  I enjoy them is because they're both so quirky, and different.

Another thing I liked was the fact that each actor was give their chance to shine in a particular episode.  Miguel Farrer was mesmerizing as Dr. Garett Macy.

It also seemed like all the actors really cared about each other. it also seemed like they weren't trying to up-stage one another, they felt like a cohesive group.  and that's what made the show a hit.

3339788,4,B0013DZNAA,"I actually discover Jordan on DVD .Having ""withdrawal symptoms"" at the end of season 2 of Bones on DVD,I searched Amazon for something similar and found this series. I wasn't disappointed,although it took a while before ""total suspension of disbelief"" works. I had to sit thru something like 6 episodes before stopping the comparison to ""Bones""and enjoying it on its own terms. I will list briefly the good and bad points I found:
The good :
As many other reviewers have pointed out,great ensemble cast,good chemistry between the main characters,clever story lines. Very creative mix of hilarity and darkness.""Bones"" took a lot from this show.
The bad:
At least for the first few episodes,I had a problem with the main character:Ms Hennessy is way too much of a looker,she struts around looking more like a model from a fashion catalogue. The rest of the cast are either plain ,quirky and foreign,deliberately so in order to make her stand out even more. We hardly see her  actually doing her job ,you know wearing a lab coat,cutting flesh at the operating table,mouthing long incomprehensible medical terms etc..Instead,I get to see her meddling with the cops'work uninvited,the motivations being really contrived at times.
The ""profiling"" scenes while fascinating at first,soon become formulaic and repetitive,especially when I view two episodes in a row .
Conclusion:
I enjoyed watching this show,but it took a while before it becomes compulsive viewing. I feel slightly put off knowing beforehand that these characters won't find any closure as the show was axed at the end of season 6.
So :Reccommended viewing,but patience is required.",1212105600,5,1641,5.169172932330827

3339790,5,B0013DZNAA,"I enjoy mysteries, that is what drew me to ""Crossing Jordan"". What kept me returning to each episode was watching the development of each of the characters, and thier interactions with each other in the workplace, the Coroner's Offices for the City of Boston. Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh (played expertly, by Jill Hennessy) lost her mother when she was ten years old, her mother was murdered, and the killer was never found. As you can probably guess by this statement, Jordan still has nightmares, anger issues, and a few other emotional issues. She delves deeper than she should into murder cases, making very interesting episodes!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossing-Jordan-Season-1/dp/B0013DZNAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossing Jordan: Season 1</a>",1211673600,2,791,6.2
3339791,5,B0013DZNAA,"It took some time for this show to find its footing and decide exactly what it wanted to be. Many expecting it to be very dark like ""Profiler"" or intricately technical like ""C.S.I."" gave up on it too soon. The pilot episode offered a lot of background and insight into Jordan Cavanaugh (Jill Hennessey). She was smart and pretty, and terribly messed up, haunted by demons from her childhood. She was also relentless in her pursuit of justice.

Once she left L.A. for Boston, joining the M.E.'s office, she gradually found a home. By the middle of season one, the show knew what it was and many were glad they'd hung around. It became this wonderfully cool show about a small group of people in the medical examiner's office, Jill Hennessy at its center, who had formed a kind of familial bond as they dealt with crimes and their personal problems. In Jordan's case, who was searching for her mother's killer, the two often intertwined.

There was a lot of quirky humor and fun mixed in with the darker elements, making for a great show. There was also a fine ensemble cast. Miguel Ferrer as Jordan's boss, Katherine Hahn as the always ""glass half full"" Lily, and Jerry O'Connell as Woody, the cop often at odds with Jordan, but sort of loving every minute of it, all brought something to the show's dynamic. Ken Howard was also good as Jordan's estranged father. But it was really Steve Valentine's Nigel and Ravi Kapoor's ""Bug"" and their interactions with Jordan which made the show special.

They bickered, got in trouble, covered for each other, and generally had a life and a family thanks to each other. Crossing Jordan really hit its stride with the two-part ""Digger"" story arc. It cemented the show to its core audience, who stayed from then on. Followed by the very good ""Blue Christmas"" episode, it had finally discovered the perfect mix of crime and quirky humor and personal woes. It was both the dark and the light.

One of the great things about the show was the music. An eclectic mix of songs was often used for atmosphere, which could run from noir to hilarity in less time than it took to make a fun reference to Elvis. From the middle of season one to the end of season two, this was great television. You could never put it in in a nice little box, pegging it as this kind of show or that. It was simply Crossing Jordan.

Here are the episodes for season one:  Pilot, The Dawn of a New Day, The Ties That Bind, Born to Run, You Can't Go Home Again, Believers, Digger, Part I, Digger, Part II, Blue Christmas, Wrong Place, Wrong Time, Blood Relatives, Miracles & Wonders, Four Fathers, Acts of Mercy, Lost and Found, Crime & Punishment, With Honor, For Harry, with Love and Squalor, The Gift of Life, Someone to Count On, Secrets & Lies, Secrets & Lies, Part II

With everything on television seeming the same, Crossing Jordan was different. Many episodes and story lines were interconnected. You never got the full story from just occasionally tuning in for a peak. It required some attention and time. It was what made the show work, and its downfall in later seasons when it tried to fit in more. Seasons one and two were terrific, however, and something a bit different for TV fans to own.",1211673600,43,3211,4.564236111111111
3339792,5,B0013DZNAA,"As of now, I've only watched the first episode.

If you like medical/criminal shows (Bones, House, CSI, etc), I would recommend this show. Every other main character adds something to the mix - and to top it off, all the actors pretty good.

I remember the first season of Bones, although I enjoyed the show, was a little stiff in the acting department. The main characters were good, but guest stars... eh, not so much.

Some of the styles seem dated, and the picture in the pilot episode seems a little off (could be my TV...), but the story is there and its good.

3339803,5,B0013DZNAA,"Wow...this was a long time coming!

This was one show that NBC truly made a mistake with in its abysmal decision not to return Crossing Jordan for a seventh season. Unlike shows that stay on well past their prime, Crossing Jordan was still in full swing and had a myriad of stories left to tell such as who killed Emily (Jordan's Mom), where did Max disappear to and why (Jordan's Dad), what was Dr. Macy's ""demon,"" would Jordan and Woody finally get together and so much more.

Crossing Jordan was an awesome television show on the NBC network. It lasted for six sesons and 116 episodes.
Season one was a ground breaker in that it showed a female lead (Jill Hennessy) who was strong, smart, independent, beautiful, vulnerable yet willing to take risks to find the truth. Jill played the character of Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh with such aplomb, realism and strength that I was hooked after viewing the premiere episode. In fact, I never missed an episode in six years!

A part of what made Crossing Jordan such a great show was the fantastic acting of its unconventional cast and the coolest music ever by Wendy and Lisa. You could not view an episode of Crossing Jordan without stopping by Best Buy the following day to pick up a CD or two of the songs heard on the show.

The writing was second to none. There were no gimmicks. You were able to watch the characaters grow and evolve. Their weaknesses and vulnerabilities were shown and this only caused the viewer to draw even closer to each of the characters. No character grabbed a hold of you like Jordan! Jill nailed the role each and every week!

Crossing Jordan truly ended way before it should have but thank goodness the network at least had the foresight to release the show on DVD.

Do yourself a favor and purchase season one. You will not be disappointed. In fact, it will leave you begging NBC to hurry and release the remaining seasons ASAP.

I have ordered my set.

Happy CJ viewing!
