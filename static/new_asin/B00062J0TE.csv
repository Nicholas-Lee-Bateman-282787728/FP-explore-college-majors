However, to fully gain an understanding of any technique I would stronly recommend instruction directly from a Goju Ryu teacher and lots of practice! This series will serve as a good suppliment in addition to your training. The only draw back to the disk is of a techinical nature. While the sound and picture quality are excellent, the company that produced the DVD did not create a menu to select either the intro, junbi undo, or stance sections. It would be very helpful for quick reference to fully utilize the chapter and search capabilites of the DVD format in future releases.",1106784000,5,729,4.748031496062992
8273941,5,B00062J0TE,"The decription of the techiques is very clear. I got many insights in things I learnt during my karate training and did not really know the reason of standing in a particular way and how to perform better certain techniques. Whatever your grade you will get a lot of useful advice.

My only worry is that the material covered is a bit limited. I hope the series will not go up to versin 4!

Anyway, I am expecting the next version with impatience.",1106611200,4,447,4.373493975903615
