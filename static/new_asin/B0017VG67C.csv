3175760,5,B0017VG67C,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is a great series that brings the family together. It's a great cartoon with martial arts, magic (bending), a great story line, character depth, and lots of humor.
My only regret is that I have had to wait 3 months between each disc.
The ""bad"" thing about it is that it was developed in Standard Definition 480p, and not even in wide screen. More could have been achieved if it had at least been done in wide screen. Excellent gift, excellent for your own personal collection.",1211846400,10,503,4.6

3175784,5,B0017VG67C,"This cartoon series entertains large groups of kids ranging from the ages of 5 to 16. I would deffinitely recommend it. This is the last disc in the first series, last season - there is a new Avatar series out that takes place 70 after the end of this one. I haven't seen the new one yet and don't know if it is as good. I like the ending of the series (spoilers) because Aang doesn't kill the Fire Lord. I think that it teaches kids there are better ways of dealing with problems rather than the obvious ones. The characters are all loveable and tend to have more depth than traditional animated characters for younger children. I would recommend this.",1321833600,,653,4.404958677685951
3175785,5,B0017VG67C,"Our family, that is mum, dad, sister and brother love this series.  In Australia it is shown on TV in the mornings from time to time.
It is funny and makes you want to watch more.  - we bought the whole series.  On TV we have watched most of the series - but of course we've also missed episodes.  With the DVDs we've been able to fill in all the gaps.  Much better than the new movie.
Would recomend this to anyone who enjoys an epic. Dad was rushing home from work at night to watch another couple of episodes despite not showing much interest when we first said we wanted to watch it.

This family also enjoys Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series.
This movie (the series) is in that league as a great story.

Not just a kids movie",1289779200,,753,4.116438356164384

This item is abut half of the price of the ENTIRE book three season. The entire book three season is only 25 dollars.

3175811,3,B0017VG67C,"Rather solid, but merely average.  The final showdown is not the epic conclusion I expected, but at least it doesn't sputter out completely.  I'd say this final collection is a moderate success.

The one thing that really bugs me about these episodes -- and about the last season in general -- is that they just CHARGE for the ending with little to no build-up.  This is a shame, since it's that build-up that made the first season so epic in scale, and also since they waste their time with a lot of filler episodes when they could have been building up the plot and characterization in those time-slots.

Chapter 16: The Southern Raiders.  Zuko and Katara soar off on Appa to find Katara's mother's killer. (Speaking of Appa... with all these nightly excursions, the poor guy hasn't had a full night's rest in a year!)  There are some just ""sweet"" battle scenes in this one; you've gotta see what Katara does with raindrops.

Cons involve a host of small, niggling concerns.  For one thing, the way they're able to float around the world so quickly, you'd think it was the size of a football field.  And, although I entirely agree with Aang's statement that revenge gains nothing, I could only roll my eyes as he talked; the preaching only made the episode feel like a morality play than actual entertainment.  Also, Katara's goody-two-shoes melodrama couldn't be worn more thin by now.

I'm fine with filler episodes -- if they're good.  It was as though they were grasping for ideas in these, and I question why they were made when there were plenty of other more nagging plot holes to fill.  This ep was more boring than anything else; if anything, it cheapened the way the first season spoke of Katara's mother's death.  I imagined something a bit more epic along the lines of, say, a Viking raid against a relatively harmless monastery in the Middle Ages, and many deaths.  But this was no raid -- how could it be when ONLY Katara's mother dies?  That's not a raid, that's assassination.

It's almost goofy, the way they ""misuse"" words in this series to amp up events that really aren't that big (e.g., ""invasion"" at the beginning of Season 3, when it was just twenty guys lobbing rocks and peanut sauce).  I suppose it wasn't the creators' faults; after the first season, it seemed Nickelodeon laid down the law and death was downplayed dramatically.  Thing is, that's what initially attracted me to the series -- its maturity and willingness to face death head-on!  Of course, by now, such maturity is utterly lost.

Chapter 17: The Ember Island Players. In a word: UGH. It's embarrassing.  The only redeeming quality is Toph; I guarantee that you'll laugh your lungs out at the super-sonic screaming.  Now, I know what the producers were going for here (a self-aware commentary filling new viewers in about past events and making statements about its fandom), but it's just lame, sad, and just a bit pretentious.

This episode could have been so, so hilarious and entertaining in many other ways.  What if it were real, honest-to-goodness Fire Nation propaganda, demonizing the Avatar, making him and his friends look like criminals, getting events wrong, and making things up? This would have been a more realistic approach, and it would have been more revealing and entertaining, too.  As it was, it was just another really lame filler episode.  I can't tell you how many times my friends and I groaned and covered our faces during this one.  Whatever you do, don't introduce your friends to Avatar with this.

Chapter 18-21: Sozin's Comet. Parts 1-4: The Phoenix King, The Old Masters, Into the Inferno, Avatar Aang.  Perhaps it is best to treat this as one whole episode.  This final grouping was all right; on a first viewing marathon-style, it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Afterward, why would you ever want to watch it again?  As other reviewers have so aptly stated, many plot threads remain dangling.  As others have NOT stated, much of it is downright boring and slow-paced with no reward.  It feels more like fluffy filler than the satisfactory meat of a plot.  Aang constantly whining about facing off with the Fire Lord was realistic, but irritating and hypocritical; Aang HAS killed somebody, and rather nastily, too.  Admiral Zhao, anybody?  Speaking of Zhao, forget pacifism and political correctness, I wanted a smack-down along the lines of the final two episodes of the first season!

At first, I loved the idea of Aang going to this ""mysterious"" island and conferring with his past lives.  However, there's no payoff; it's irritating that Aang won't listen to them.  The ""wise words"" of the Lionturtle weren't actually wise as much as they were gobbledygook, and you can't even understand him the first time you hear him.  In fact, even when you DO finally understand him, you realize that he says something entirely DIFFERENT in the final episode when Aang bends the Fire Lord.  So what was the point in the first Lionturtle exposition?  To sound smart, I suppose.  If you wanted some closure in that episode, you would have been disappointed.

Also, for those of you who like hilarious, goofy lines that should never have been written: the Fire Lord's big plan is to remove the Earth Nation's (wait for it!) ""hopes.""  (Snerk!)  Then he starts removing those hopes by burning an uninhabited forest, and only attacks with like... twelve airships.  The whole continent's population could simply move to the other side while he got finished burning one half, and then move back as he made his second and third circuits.  It's ridiculous.

The unbinding of the 7th Chakra was lame, as was the whole fight with the Fire Lord.  There's some flying... lots of flying.  And punching.  And some fire.  Aang running like a wussy.  Yawn.  Aang's flying, I understand; the retarded Fire Nation version of flying, with rocket-powered fists, should never, ever have been invented. (Everyone in the household sniggers every time someone lifts off with fire shooting from fists and feet like a human space shuttle.)  The fighting only pays off in the latter half, when Aang enters the Avatar State and starts kicking the Fire Lord around like a rag doll.

However, if you want to see something awesome, Azula's unraveling and eventual madness is downright sweet and can't be missed.  I would have liked to see it more spread out, as the madness occurs so quickly that it's easy to misunderstand why it occurs.  Ironically, the fight that cannot be missed in this DVD set is not that between Aang and Ozai, but the Agni Kai between Azula and Zuko.  The soft, understated music, the muted sounds of fire and shouting, gives me chills every time -- even when I think about it.  In fact, during Aang's fight with the Fire Lord, I was waiting breathlessly to return to the Agni Kai.

Aang's final KO of the Fire Lord is anti-climactic.  Just think: if Zuko hadn't taken over at home, the Mind-Bending would have been for naught (there's still Azula to contend with).  Furthermore, the Fire Lord's still the leader of the darn country, firebender or no.  So it really wasn't a very satisfying ending, all things considered.  It just seemed... mushy.  Rushed. Uneven. Anti-climactic.  Still, at least the Fire Lord got his comeuppance.

Finally, the final kiss is just... ugh.  That romance never, ever made sense to me; you know how 12-year-olds approach romance?  Not very seriously, right?  And you know how big that gap looks between you and a kid one mere grade above you?  Yeah.  That's why this relationship creeps me out.  Katara is almost robbing the cradle.  The romance is displayed as something ""lasting"" and central when it is just goofy and awkward and has no grounds in reality.  In a year they'll both hate each other.

All things considered, this set contains some rather awkward and unsatisfying episodes... a lot of filler, a rushed plot and characterization.  It's mostly tepid.  You can still find some real gems in there, though -- some beautiful fight scenes, hilarious dialogue, and wonderful ideas.  You'll thrill at the sight of the giant Lionturtle.  You'll adore the fight scenes and Toph's ""Iron Man.""  You'll giggle at the romance between Sokka and Tsuki.  But you'll probably only watch this DVD once a year or during an Avatar marathon... it's just not very satisfying or half as interesting as previous episodes.",1223856000,2,8371,4.81811797752809
3175812,4,B0017VG67C,"My only complaint is that this DVD has the episodes that also make up the ""Sozin's Comet"" DVD. I purchased both of them without knowing this. Love this series though. Cartoons made in the style that I remember as a kid back in the 80's.",1223769600,,236,4.266666666666667

At last the time has come for Aang to face the Fire Lord. The world comes full circle and the power of the Avatar is finally realized. Will Aang be powerful enough to defeat the Fire Lord and will he finish him off or stand by his principles that there must be another way to rid the world of Ozai?

3175818,5,B0017VG67C,"I'm so glad I purchased the whole Avatar series, part on Amazon Unbox Service and the rest via Amazon DVD purchase. I've so enjoyed the entire Avatar series with my kids and have been amazed as to the depth the writers have put into it. At first glance it might look like just another cute kids anime cartoon but on closer examination I found wonderful examples of interpersonal relating, forgiveness, inner healing, anger management, trust of self and of soul predispositions & healing. I noted one of the most simple, elegant, yet complete expressions of the chakra system in a way that kids could begin to understand their emotional state of being and how this interacts with the body's energy centers as well as subtle suggestion as to how to begin the path to being balanced and free of emotional baggage yet rich in energy and expression... So much more.

While I understand that some of strong religious devotion may see some of this content as evil or bad, I personally found it refreshing, very much about balance, healing and learning to truly Be a heart based human, not just act like one, so many encouragements to real authenticity... I applaud the writers of this series and encourage more!",1220745600,,1204,4.760765550239235

There are still a lot of unanswered questions so that leads me to think there maybe more to come. Without giving any of this ending away, I pose the question of whether the air nation finds rebirth in the mist of end of the tyranny?  The one thing that makes this weak is the switching back and forth between being on the quest and shucking off time like the end of the world is not near.

I was sad thinking this would be the end but the very last minute left the hope that more could follow,  The series is much more than just martial arts, though it handles that very well - it's about character development and inter-relationships - it has serious plot development carried through from beginning to end.

3175836,4,B0017VG67C,"Volume four takes the viewer through the last six episodes of the Avatar cartoon series. Avatar has been a quality cartoon from day one, and does not disappoint: if you keep in mind that is a cartoon, and nothing more.

In the Southern Raiders, Katara and Zuko take a trip to confront the demons of her past. Katara is forced to choose her path, and goes through some character growth here. Zuko's response to it in the end delivers a question Aang can't answer.

In the Ember Island Players, the kids watch a play chronicling their journey. They each (well, except Tuff) see a piece of themselves they're not entirely comfortable with. No one except Aang seems to do much soul-searching over it, so its value is only in poking fun at the main characters, which I actually enjoyed.

Sozin's Comet is a four-part episode. Aang agonizes yet again. Everyone says he has to kill the Firelord, which goes against everything he's ever been taught. He goes off on his own to meditate. Everyone looks for him. Yeah, I know, we've seen this before.

Aang gets alot of advice he doesn't particularly like, but comes to accept. Meanwhile, the other kids prioritize, and get their acts together to do something about the Firelord's plans.

When the Firelord comes knocking, Aang is ready to face him. Here we see Aang (and bending in general) doing things we've never seen him do. He comes into his own as the Avatar. Even before going into the Avatar state, he shows that he really is a master of the four elements. It's a cartoon, but it's cool. Meanwhile, Zuko and Azula go at it.

Aang goes into the Avatar state and unleashes hell. Then he does something even all the avatars of the past didn't know was possible. Katara pulls a final trick out of thin air and shows herself a true master of waterbending.

There is rarely a cartoon that comes along and pulls me in like this. Entertaining, clean, action-oriented fun that anyone in the family can watch. The characters grow in skill and maturity throughout the series, and the stakes keep climbing, right up to the end. I give this conclusion four stars.",1219363200,,2098,4.623655913978495

Anyone that has seen any of the past episodes (and those that haven't) must not miss Book 3 Vol. 4. Aside from the visuals and sounds there are so many messages (some hidden, some obvious) that you must view it a few times so as not to miss them all.

I too am worried that a live action Avatar in the ""wrong hands"" would be a disaster. I cannot wait for a comprehensive Blue Ray box set of the entire series. If you are new to the series I suggest starting from the beginning to fully understand what has lead up to this epic conclusion (your kids will also love you for it ;^).

I've watch the series from the beginning have rarely been disappointed with an episode. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of animated story telling.

Chapter 20: Sozin's Comet Part 3: Into the Inferno - Zuko and Katara pair up to face Azula in the Fire Nation, while Sokka, Zuki and Toph team up to stop Lord Ozai and his army from destroying the Earth Kingdom.

Chapter 21: Sozin's Comet Part 4: Avatar Aang - The Grande Finale, including Aang's final confrontation with the Fire Lord and Zuko's with his sister.

While I found Chapter 17 mostly missable, the final four chapters (18-21) run together like a full-length movie! All loose ends (that I could think of) get tied up nicely, including the fates of all the main and secondary characters.

An excellent way to end the entire series!",1216512000,40,1435,4.556420233463035

3410308,3,B0017VG67C,"Rather solid, but merely average.  The final showdown is not the epic conclusion I expected, but at least it doesn't sputter out completely.  I'd say this final collection is a moderate success.

The one thing that really bugs me about these episodes -- and about the last season in general -- is that they just CHARGE for the ending with little to no build-up.  This is a shame, since it's that build-up that made the first season so epic in scale, and also since they waste their time with a lot of filler episodes when they could have been building up the plot and characterization in those time-slots.

Chapter 16: The Southern Raiders.  Zuko and Katara soar off on Appa to find Katara's mother's killer. (Speaking of Appa... with all these nightly excursions, the poor guy hasn't had a full night's rest in a year!)  There are some just ""sweet"" battle scenes in this one; you've gotta see what Katara does with raindrops.

Cons involve a host of small, niggling concerns.  For one thing, the way they're able to float around the world so quickly, you'd think it was the size of a football field.  And, although I entirely agree with Aang's statement that revenge gains nothing, I could only roll my eyes as he talked; the preaching only made the episode feel like a morality play than actual entertainment.  Also, Katara's goody-two-shoes melodrama couldn't be worn more thin by now.

I'm fine with filler episodes -- if they're good.  It was as though they were grasping for ideas in these, and I question why they were made when there were plenty of other more nagging plot holes to fill.  This ep was more boring than anything else; if anything, it cheapened the way the first season spoke of Katara's mother's death.  I imagined something a bit more epic along the lines of, say, a Viking raid against a relatively harmless monastery in the Middle Ages, and many deaths.  But this was no raid -- how could it be when ONLY Katara's mother dies?  That's not a raid, that's assassination.

It's almost goofy, the way they ""misuse"" words in this series to amp up events that really aren't that big (e.g., ""invasion"" at the beginning of Season 3, when it was just twenty guys lobbing rocks and peanut sauce).  I suppose it wasn't the creators' faults; after the first season, it seemed Nickelodeon laid down the law and death was downplayed dramatically.  Thing is, that's what initially attracted me to the series -- its maturity and willingness to face death head-on!  Of course, by now, such maturity is utterly lost.

Chapter 17: The Ember Island Players. In a word: UGH. It's embarrassing.  The only redeeming quality is Toph; I guarantee that you'll laugh your lungs out at the super-sonic screaming.  Now, I know what the producers were going for here (a self-aware commentary filling new viewers in about past events and making statements about its fandom), but it's just lame, sad, and just a bit pretentious.

This episode could have been so, so hilarious and entertaining in many other ways.  What if it were real, honest-to-goodness Fire Nation propaganda, demonizing the Avatar, making him and his friends look like criminals, getting events wrong, and making things up? This would have been a more realistic approach, and it would have been more revealing and entertaining, too.  As it was, it was just another really lame filler episode.  I can't tell you how many times my friends and I groaned and covered our faces during this one.  Whatever you do, don't introduce your friends to Avatar with this.

Chapter 18-21: Sozin's Comet. Parts 1-4: The Phoenix King, The Old Masters, Into the Inferno, Avatar Aang.  Perhaps it is best to treat this as one whole episode.  This final grouping was all right; on a first viewing marathon-style, it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Afterward, why would you ever want to watch it again?  As other reviewers have so aptly stated, many plot threads remain dangling.  As others have NOT stated, much of it is downright boring and slow-paced with no reward.  It feels more like fluffy filler than the satisfactory meat of a plot.  Aang constantly whining about facing off with the Fire Lord was realistic, but irritating and hypocritical; Aang HAS killed somebody, and rather nastily, too.  Admiral Zhao, anybody?  Speaking of Zhao, forget pacifism and political correctness, I wanted a smack-down along the lines of the final two episodes of the first season!

At first, I loved the idea of Aang going to this ""mysterious"" island and conferring with his past lives.  However, there's no payoff; it's irritating that Aang won't listen to them.  The ""wise words"" of the Lionturtle weren't actually wise as much as they were gobbledygook, and you can't even understand him the first time you hear him.  In fact, even when you DO finally understand him, you realize that he says something entirely DIFFERENT in the final episode when Aang bends the Fire Lord.  So what was the point in the first Lionturtle exposition?  To sound smart, I suppose.  If you wanted some closure in that episode, you would have been disappointed.

Also, for those of you who like hilarious, goofy lines that should never have been written: the Fire Lord's big plan is to remove the Earth Nation's (wait for it!) ""hopes.""  (Snerk!)  Then he starts removing those hopes by burning an uninhabited forest, and only attacks with like... twelve airships.  The whole continent's population could simply move to the other side while he got finished burning one half, and then move back as he made his second and third circuits.  It's ridiculous.

The unbinding of the 7th Chakra was lame, as was the whole fight with the Fire Lord.  There's some flying... lots of flying.  And punching.  And some fire.  Aang running like a wussy.  Yawn.  Aang's flying, I understand; the retarded Fire Nation version of flying, with rocket-powered fists, should never, ever have been invented. (Everyone in the household sniggers every time someone lifts off with fire shooting from fists and feet like a human space shuttle.)  The fighting only pays off in the latter half, when Aang enters the Avatar State and starts kicking the Fire Lord around like a rag doll.

However, if you want to see something awesome, Azula's unraveling and eventual madness is downright sweet and can't be missed.  I would have liked to see it more spread out, as the madness occurs so quickly that it's easy to misunderstand why it occurs.  Ironically, the fight that cannot be missed in this DVD set is not that between Aang and Ozai, but the Agni Kai between Azula and Zuko.  The soft, understated music, the muted sounds of fire and shouting, gives me chills every time -- even when I think about it.  In fact, during Aang's fight with the Fire Lord, I was waiting breathlessly to return to the Agni Kai.

Aang's final KO of the Fire Lord is anti-climactic.  Just think: if Zuko hadn't taken over at home, the Mind-Bending would have been for naught (there's still Azula to contend with).  Furthermore, the Fire Lord's still the leader of the darn country, firebender or no.  So it really wasn't a very satisfying ending, all things considered.  It just seemed... mushy.  Rushed. Uneven. Anti-climactic.  Still, at least the Fire Lord got his comeuppance.

Finally, the final kiss is just... ugh.  That romance never, ever made sense to me; you know how 12-year-olds approach romance?  Not very seriously, right?  And you know how big that gap looks between you and a kid one mere grade above you?  Yeah.  That's why this relationship creeps me out.  Katara is almost robbing the cradle.  The romance is displayed as something ""lasting"" and central when it is just goofy and awkward and has no grounds in reality.  In a year they'll both hate each other.

All things considered, this set contains some rather awkward and unsatisfying episodes... a lot of filler, a rushed plot and characterization.  It's mostly tepid.  You can still find some real gems in there, though -- some beautiful fight scenes, hilarious dialogue, and wonderful ideas.  You'll thrill at the sight of the giant Lionturtle.  You'll adore the fight scenes and Toph's ""Iron Man.""  You'll giggle at the romance between Sokka and Tsuki.  But you'll probably only watch this DVD once a year or during an Avatar marathon... it's just not very satisfying or half as interesting as previous episodes.",1223856000,2,8371,4.81811797752809

I've so enjoyed the entire Avatar series with my kids and have been amazed as to the depth the writers have put into it. At first glance it might look like just another cute kids anime cartoon but on closer examination I found wonderful examples of interpersonal relating, forgiveness, inner healing, anger management, trust of self and of soul predispositions & healing. I noted one of the most simple, elegant, yet complete expressions of the chakra system in a way that kids could begin to understand their emotional state of being and how this interacts with the body's energy centers as well as subtle suggestion as to how to begin the path to being balanced and free of emotional baggage yet rich in energy and expression... So much more.

While I understand that some of strong religious devotion may see some of this content as evil or bad, I personally found it refreshing, very much about balance, healing and learning to truly Be a heart based human, not just act like one, so many encouragements to real authenticity...

3410333,4,B0017VG67C,"Volume four takes the viewer through the last six episodes of the Avatar cartoon series. Avatar has been a quality cartoon from day one, and does not disappoint: if you keep in mind that is a cartoon, and nothing more.

In the Southern Raiders, Katara and Zuko take a trip to confront the demons of her past. Katara is forced to choose her path, and goes through some character growth here. Zuko's response to it in the end delivers a question Aang can't answer.

In the Ember Island Players, the kids watch a play chronicling their journey. They each (well, except Tuff) see a piece of themselves they're not entirely comfortable with. No one except Aang seems to do much soul-searching over it, so its value is only in poking fun at the main characters, which I actually enjoyed.

Sozin's Comet is a four-part episode. Aang agonizes yet again. Everyone says he has to kill the Firelord, which goes against everything he's ever been taught. He goes off on his own to meditate. Everyone looks for him. Yeah, I know, we've seen this before.

Aang gets alot of advice he doesn't particularly like, but comes to accept. Meanwhile, the other kids prioritize, and get their acts together to do something about the Firelord's plans.

When the Firelord comes knocking, Aang is ready to face him. Here we see Aang (and bending in general) doing things we've never seen him do. He comes into his own as the Avatar. Even before going into the Avatar state, he shows that he really is a master of the four elements. It's a cartoon, but it's cool. Meanwhile, Zuko and Azula go at it.

Aang goes into the Avatar state and unleashes hell. Then he does something even all the avatars of the past didn't know was possible. Katara pulls a final trick out of thin air and shows herself a true master of waterbending.

There is rarely a cartoon that comes along and pulls me in like this. Entertaining, clean, action-oriented fun that anyone in the family can watch. The characters grow in skill and maturity throughout the series, and the stakes keep climbing, right up to the end. I give this conclusion four stars.",1219363200,,2098,4.623655913978495

I looked on TV.com yesterday and the Director's and Cast's reveiw was that the other Half of season 3 and then season 4 is going to start this September/October!!! What i am really trying to say is that at the end of part 4 of Sozin's comet Zuko said ""NOW TELL ME WHERE IS MY MOTHER""!!!!! That means that episode is just a sequal to the rest of the Avater the last airbender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1216598400,2,502,4.467391304347826
3410344,5,B0017VG67C,"Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the most creative cartoons I've ever seen in my life. It's not only creative but funny. I'm 23 years old and got hooked on this when the kids I babysit for (6 and 2) popped in the DVD, then asked me to read the comic book. I thought it was really cute at first but very quickly got hooked. It puts me in mind of the Hayao Miyazaki films... cartoons but something the whole family can enjoy. This particular volume is the conclusion of the series, which ties everything together very nicely I think (though I really would have liked to know what happened to Zuko's mother).",1216512000,2,608,4.342105263157895
3410345,5,B0017VG67C,"This disk contains these final 6 episodes of the final season:

Chapter 16: The Southern Raiders - Prince Zuko and Katara take off on a private mission, to find the killer of Katara and Sokka's mother.

Chapter 17: The Ember Island Players - Prince Zuko takes the gang to his family island resort where they watch a theater representation of their history.

Chapter 18: Sozin's Comet Part 1: The Phoenix King - ""Team Avatar"" (Sokka's pet name for the group) prepares for a confrontation with the Fire Lord while Ozai assigns Azula a special honorable title - and crowns himself Supreme Ruler - with his own special title.

Chapter 19: Sozin's Comet Part 2: The Old Masters - Aang sets out alone to decide how to deal with the Fire Lord while the rest of the group set out to find Uncle Iroh.

Chapter 20: Sozin's Comet Part 3: Into the Inferno - Zuko and Katara pair up to face Azula in the Fire Nation, while Sokka, Zuki and Toph team up to stop Lord Ozai and his army from destroying the Earth Kingdom.

Chapter 21: Sozin's Comet Part 4: Avatar Aang - The Grande Finale, including Aang's final confrontation with the Fire Lord and Zuko's with his sister.

While I found Chapter 17 mostly missable, the final four chapters (18-21) run together like a full-length movie! All loose ends (that I could think of) get tied up nicely, including the fates of all the main and secondary characters.

An excellent way to end the entire series!",1216512000,40,1435,4.556420233463035
3410346,5,B0017VG67C,"This has to be the best series I've ever watched and even though I'm 17, I still love this cartoon.  My family makes fun of me for how excited and hyped up I get about this show, but I still love to tell them every minute detail of every episode.  This DVD should be one of, or THE, best one yet and it will probably say whether or not the series will continue.",1215388800,5,361,3.9315068493150687

Sure it's annoying with how long it's taken for the whole story to come out, but all of the discs are finally about to be on DVD and maybe blueray.  So there's nothing to wait for. I mean it.  This story is inspiring and funny how it's all put together, and it's creative (that's how I liked it).",1214352000,4,421,4.109756097560975
