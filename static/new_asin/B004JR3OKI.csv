4391131,5,B004JR3OKI,Excellent DVD on forensics and how it helps solve crimes. You will be able to follow along and try to solve it as the crime investigators do.,1334102400,8,141,4.2592592592592595
4391132,5,B004JR3OKI,"This dvd covers actual crime scene investigations and lets the viewer decide at the end, who committed the crime before showing you who actually committed the crime. Great training tool!!!",1396915200,,188,5.3
4391133,5,B004JR3OKI,Excellent for Forensic classes to remind them to think from all angles. Evidence can lead to several outcomes and truth is stranger than fiction. Every student reported they liked the episode shown.,1395619200,,198,5.21875
4391134,5,B004JR3OKI,My forensics students have enjoyed every episode. I wish there were more seasons available to purchase! I would suggest this to anyone teaching forensic science.,1384732800,2,161,5.48
4391135,5,B004JR3OKI,I have shown a few of these episodes to my Physical Science class and they absolutely love it. Would recommend to anyone doing a forensic science unit in their classes (or anyone interested in the topics).,1380240000,2,205,4.722222222222222
4391136,5,B004JR3OKI,This movie gets the students thinking and analyzing data to decide what they believe.  Are the suspects guilty then why?  Why might others think they are innocent?  It gets great discussions going!,1373328000,5,197,5.09375
4391137,5,B004JR3OKI,These are well presented real life crime stories which we enjoy watching the police do a great job. This is a good product that was as described. It arrived on time and was well packaged.,1366416000,5,187,4.371428571428571
4391138,5,B004JR3OKI,This was a great analysis of how forensic opinions can vary depending on who's reviewing it.  I even sent this to my daughter's high school forensic science teacher to review and maybe show to the class as there is no nudity or profanity or even too graphic scene's in this.  You think you believe one side until you hear the other side's theory on the forensic evidence.,1360022400,5,371,4.522388059701493
4391139,5,B004JR3OKI,I use this for my HS Forensic Science course. We watch one case every week and the students are interested. The dicussions that occur afterwards really demonstrate students' logical and critical thinking skills as they analyze and discuss the evidence and then decide if they agree with the jury's verdict. I would highly recommend this to any HS or College Forensics course!,1357948800,2,375,5.064516129032258
4391140,4,B004JR3OKI,"At a crime scene, every piece of evidence is critical to the investigation and helps tell the true time line of events for the deceased. FORENSICS: YOU DECIDE presents real-world compelling cases in which the same set of forensic evidence can be interpreted to tell two very different stories. In each episode, someone stands accused. But there are two sides to every story, and where one set of experts sees a definite murder, another may argue that the cause of death is a suicide or an unfortunate accident. In the end, the jury gives its verdict - guilty or innocent - but what interpretation of the forensic evidence was most convincing for the audience ?

This is a great show, very unique and so interesting. If, like me, you enjoy watching shows about Criminology and Forensic Science then you'll enjoy watching FORENSICS: YOU DECIDE. The way this show is presented is great, you feel like you're part of the investigation and it's very interesting to see both sides of a case, people who think the suspect is guilty and the others who believe that the suspect his innocent. The 5 cases you'll find on this set are all interesting, the narration is great, overall this is a great show to watch and I highly recommend this DVD to anybody having a passion for Criminology. :)

On this set you'll find 5 interesting episodes. Each episode is 47 minutes long.

1. Blood Brothers: Life has not been kind to Peter Maurek. Grief-stricken over the recent losses in his life, Peter has those closest to him worried -- nobody more so than his older brother, Greg. Greg is up late, on Mother's Day 2005, when Peter stumbles into the family home drunk and belligerent. A fight breaks out between brothers, and moments later a single gunshot sails through the Oklahoma night. Is this a tragic case of suicide or deadly fraternal passion? The forensic experts on each side battle it out. Who do you think got it right?

2. Caught On Tape: On a rainy October night in 2006, flames erupt out of the seventh floor of a downtown Baltimore apartment building. Within minutes firefighters arrive to quell the flames, but inside they find the badly beaten body of makeup artist Marcus Rogers. He is rushed to the hospital but does not survive the vicious attack. Investigators concentrate their investigation on surveillance footage from the lobby of the building. Minutes before the fire alarm goes off, a man is seen exiting the building in a leather coat with fur trim. Could this be the same man seen entering the building with the victim earlier that day, or is it pure coincidence? Experts analyze the footage and the crime scene and come to two stunningly different conclusions.

3. Nature's Evidence: Two children vanish under their stepfather's watchful eye. Two months later, their badly decomposing remains are discovered near a local cemetery. Police suspect their stepfather is behind the murders. Using insect and seed evidence, experts for the prosecution say they can prove it. But there are two sides to every story. And when the defense takes over, they say the same evidence clears their client and the real killer is still out there. It's a case that rests on Mother Nature. Watch as two sets of forensic experts battle over the biological evidence.

4. Deadly Kiss: When a teenage girl heads out to a concert, she has no idea that she will never return alive. Years after her disappearance, a man ends up on trial for the girl's death. A range of forensics experts look at the evidence to decide whether the man is innocent or a predator.

5. Silent Witness: When a man discovers that his girlfriend has been brutally killed, his world falls apart. His dogs have also been abused and beaten. In this episode, forensics experts go head to head to figure out whether the tow truck driver is a grieving boyfriend or a calculating killer. The dogs may help them crack the case.",1352160000,6,3881,4.749258160237389
4391141,4,B004JR3OKI,"The cases on the DVDs are presented from both sides of the story.  You have the opportunity to hear several stories, then at the end they tell you the actual outcome of the real case.  Interesting to students in a criminal justice class.",1347580800,7,237,4.488372093023256

8431990,5,B004JR3OKI,Horrifying to encounter a case or two where you believe The Jury made wrong decisions.  Frightening to think Justice could be NOT done.  Life is short and does Evil exist?  TV versions of Forensics are truly phony.,1419120000,,214,4.72972972972973

At the very end of the episode after they tell you how it was resolved they ask, ""what did you decide?"" kind of like a prompt for a discussion, nothing more than that.",1403568000,2,255,4.224489795918367
