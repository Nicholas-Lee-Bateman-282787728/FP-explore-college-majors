810725,4,6304233787,"Smashing Cast, direction-extraordinaire, wonderful acting (delightfully-portrayed  - following real-life events upon the high seas - reducing all fair and decent-minded people to tears of impotent frustration and despair.) Nota Bene: The 'burning' desire (to 'do' something in order to help these poor, innocent, beautiful 'children of the Universe' by protecting and releasing Them from Their never-ending nightmare, having to encounter - 'circumstances of embarkation'; Wholly Irrelevant - an; out-of-control 'mob' of howling, murderous demons in human form and attire) is overwhelming, throughout most of the film. However: ""Those who live in 'the dark' shall, always be; exposed in 'the light.'""",1201046400,4,699,5.99
810726,5,6304233787,"This movie has stuck with me since I first saw it on HBO back in '96 and I am so happy to now own it on dvd.  This is one I'll be sharing with everyone I know.  Such a sad story but one that needed to be told.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you rooting for Omar Epp's character to somehow escape his brother and the other seven stowaway's fate.  Very tragic but it culminates to a very justifiable ending.  Omar Epps, as always, delivers superbly and props to Danny Glover who was the Executive Producer.",1181433600,8,525,4.058252427184466
810727,5,6304233787,"If you want your nerves wrenched and nails bitten to shreads, then you must prepare yourself to view this chilling  HBO true story of nine West Ghanan stowaways bound for ""The Promised Land"" aboard a Russian Carco Ship in 1992. The very existence of these nine men posed such a threat to the future of the ship's future,the captain and the crew,that any measures had to be taken in order to squelch the men from being seen. Featuring a well-recognized cast including Omar Epps,Chiwetel Ejiofor and Joss Ackland,HBO showcases why, once again, they are the premiere organization to bring first-rate entertainment to the screen. THE ACTION AND TENSION NEVER LETS UP.",1171756800,2,663,4.972972972972973
810728,3,6304233787,"HBO prides itself--with some justification--on its hard hitting, made for cable fare.  ""Deadly Voyage,"" based on a real-life incident, in which several African stowaways on a cargo ship to France (and ultimately,  they hope, to the U.S.) are caught by the crew and brutally murdered.  The  lone survivor sees to it that justice is eventually served, but not before  a harrowing escape that stays with you well after the film is over.
The  racial theme is but one of the many explored here.  The murderous crew are  post-Communist Russians and Romanians whose desperate attempt to preserve  their jobs (if the stowaways are discovered they'll likely be sacked by the  international shipping firm they feel lucky to have found work with).  It  thus becomes a battle of wills between representatives of two desperate  camps.  (At one point, a Russian sailor asks the Africans how much they  make a day in their home country.  Told that the Africans make about $3.00  a day, he responds that in contemporary Russia and the Ukraine, they could  only make $1.00.  This kind of one-downsmanship suggests that the real  reason they resort to murder has less to do with race--although that  certainly is a factor--and more to do with the dehumanizing effects of  poverty and social turmoil.
The pacing of ""Deadly Voyage"" could  have been better.  The fact that it's relatively low budget does show.  Despite the fact that it is a very well acted film, we probably could have  used a little more time to get to know the characters before it all  explodes.  Still, the filmmakers have done a remarkable job working under  obvious time and budget constraints.  There are moments in this film that  could break your heart.",960768000,22,1709,4.891228070175439
