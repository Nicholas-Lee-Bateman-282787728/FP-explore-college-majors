8123912,4,B000FKO01K,"This DVD is quite a delightful field presentation of Desert Flowers in USA conducted by a Botanist from California and guests. The Music is nice and cheery.
There are 3 Sections...the 3rd is my favorite (Desert Gold) Nicely narrated_
relaxing and interesting.

To Americans ""your desert flowers are lovely"".....I know ours are beautiful in Australia but I love your Californian Poppies and the Mexican ones too.",1318291200,,411,5.2272727272727275

This lovely documentary explores the California and Arizona desserts in ways the eye can't imagine or forsee.  Similarily, the narrative and corresponding music captures the peacefulness and tranquility that you would expect from an outstanding documentary.  This is a must see for all ages!",1204070400,2,360,5.509090909090909
8123914,5,B000FKO01K,"I found this to be an outstanding film about California and Arizona wildflowers. It did a great job of capturing the beauty of the blossoms. (They should be particularly marvelous this year,2008, with the abundant rainfall in the region.)
The cinematography and the narration were both superb; and the ornithological portions were equally well done.
This film is a must for all gardeners, bird watchers and anyone else interested in the wonders of nature.",1203811200,5,455,5.162162162162162

8123916,5,B000FKO01K,"Since I know very little about the desert, I really liked seeing the beautiful array of flowers that bloom in the desert occasionally.  After viewing the blooms of the desert, I really appreciated the close-ups and the names of the flowers and the birds and animals that inhabit the desert.  A first rate presentation!!",1203206400,2,319,4.888888888888889
