8480903,5,B005O22ZFW,"This DVD is actually the first in what became a five part series (the whole series is also available now as a boxed set).  If you or a loved one enjoy watching the colorful and BIG tinplate trains of the 1920s and 1930s in action, these DVD's are for you!  The photography is crisp, colorful and artistically shot.  But what really surprised me about these DVD's -- and they only get better after the first one -- is how much heart and intelligent humor went into the narration.  These collectors are passionate about their trains!

Oftentimes a documentary such as this might be in danger of being a little dry.  Collectors sometimes obsess over slight variations in a product's color or graphics. I have read toy train articles that - while informative - are just well...I guess dull is the word.

Not the case here!  The collectors interviewed have strong opinions, but they are expressed with humor and good nature.  Believe it or not, the producers also manage to slip in some wonder philosophical observations about why people feel the way they do about certain toys, and what inspires collecting in general.

I have watched the first three DVD's in this series so far.  While this debut one is great, each successive entry was even better.  Highly recommended for the lover of pre-war tinplate electric trains!",1387670400,,1317,4.778761061946903
