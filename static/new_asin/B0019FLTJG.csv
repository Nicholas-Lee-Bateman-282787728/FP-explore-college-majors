I mean these are robots they should be faster, stronger, and smarter. 2nd the action scene could've maybe had more action, maybe more explotions, or a better fight scene to make the movie more exciting.",1503619200,,340,4.779661016949152
8536895,3,B0019FLTJG,"This isn't as bad as people think
This could very well be a passing school project
All it needs is:
Better animation
Better characters and models
Better and longer/deeper plot
A proper full ending
Better acting
And villain
Only remove the dumb monitor robot
And it could be far better",1486166400,,284,4.7
