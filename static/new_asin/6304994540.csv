949365,5,6304994540,"One of the all time classic silly funny movies, perhaps the best Coen Brothers movie.  It deserves a place on the bucket list of every ""guy"" from the 70's and 80's.  For complete viewing pleasure, watch on a big screen with good speakers, and cold beer (or White Russians)  You will never think the same about Jeff Bridges again -- he was masterful.  He must have has so much fun playing ""the Dude.""
viewer advisory: the dialog is quite full of zesty expletives and some other R-stuff, so not for the children or faint of heart..",1523318400,,529,4.479166666666667

They told me to rent it, which I did. I didn't laugh at all. And I have performed on stage in comedies and think I have a good sense of humor, at least my audiences must think so because they laughed. Maybe there is something wrong with me or maybe it is just a generation gap, but I did not find this movie funny at all. Did I miss some point?

I didn't see it for such a long time, because I just don't like the Dude character.  Or any of the others -- it's just a story about rotten people with some of them doing good sporadically and the rest working an angle.  Most of them we pretty certifiable and not entertaining anti-hero role models, but who am I to grouse -- the thing works.

If you never have seen it yet and are reading this deeply into the reviews -- maybe they should do a film of your life if you were born before 1990.  Jsut sayin', heh.",1507593600,,768,4.183673469387755

This movie sucked from start to finish. It felt like Jeff Bridges was playing Jeff Bridges. John Goodman overracts. Rest of the cast? Forgettable. Plot? Totally not realistic, even if we suspend disbelief. Lots of cussing for the sake of cussing. I think the part that irritated me the most was how the main character simply won't drop his horrible friend no matter how horrible he gets or how many times he totally messes up everything. It's pathetic and it was depressing to me. There is not a granule of anything redeemable about this movie. I want my 2 hours back. I am so glad I only paid 3 dollars for this at Half Price Books, which I consider far too much at this point. Seriously, do not waste your time like I wasted mine.",1497571200,,900,4.288235294117647

950572,5,6304994540,"As a college student with a very busy schedule, life can be very stressful at times. For me, when I get stressed I watch films. This has been my favorite pastimes for many years and, in those years, I have seen many movies. Some of the movies have been entertaining and well made, while others have been complete failures. One film that is among the more memorable is the Coen brothers film The Big Lebowski. This 1998 comedy is certainly one of the best, and most hilarious, films I have ever watched. The hilarious dialogue, enthralling story, and great acting are what make The Big Lebowski one of the most influential films in recent years.
 The dialogue is one of the most effective pieces in this film. It is certainly a film that I, and many people around me, quote frequently. One of the most memorable lines in the movie is the classic, The rug really tied the room together, (The Big Lebowski), which is repeated numerous times throughout the film. This is funny because the rug, that is so frequently mentioned, was urinated on at the very beginning of the movie and, it is the only reason why the Dude pushes on through the madness during the film. Another, and equally memorable, quote in the film is at the very end of the film when the Dude utters, Yeah? Well, the Dude abides, (The Big Lebowski). This laid back comment is so comical because the Dude has gone through so much at this point in the film, yet he is still content with the way things ended up. The memorable dialogue in The Big Lebowski is credited to the movies brilliant writers Joel and Ethan Coen, who also directed the film.
 Another great component of the Coen brothers writing can be seen in the films outrageous story. There are so many twists and turns in this movie which just adds to the hilarity of it all. The film starts with a bang when the Dude returns to his home, after grocery shopping, and is attacked by two men asking, Wheres the money Lebowski? (The Big Lebowski). The comedy in this scene comes from, the Dude getting mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, and being the inciting incident that throws the Dude immediately into his absurd quest for a new rug. Another hilarious part of the film is when John Goodmans character, Walter Sobchak the Vietnam War vet, destroys a Corvette  he mistakenly thought was a young boys, with a crowbar, which resulted in the cars true owner smashing the Dudes car. In any movie, no matter how good the writing is, the actors must be able to deliver it in a way that is believable. In the case of The Big Lebowski, it must also be funny, and that is exactly what the actors were able to accomplish.
 The acting is by far the most important aspect of the entire movie. Everyone who was cast in The Big Lebowski was able to deliver every joke with great timing, yet make their character believable even though the story is so off the wall. Jeff Bridges portrayal of the Dude could not have been better because he was able to make the absurdity going on around him completely believable. A great example of Bridges ability to do this is in the scene where the Dude gets one of his friends ashes thrown in his face while spreading them in the ocean. What makes Jeff Bridges acting so funny in this scene is his stoic face and almost non-existent reaction. John Goodman also did a fantastic job as Walter in this film. As his character, Goodman had to go from being completely calm, to being furious, back to acting completely calm in an instant and thats exactly what he did. The scene that Goodman demonstrates this best is when he pulls a gun on one of his friends for not marking their foul while bowling. To this day, whenever I see Bridges in a film, I immediately think of the Dude.
 While there are many fans of the film, it is, of course, not for everyone. The biggest complaint I have heard from the people that I have recommended the movie to has been that, while there are many surprises in it, the film doesnt really go anywhere, which is exactly what I thought the first time I watched the film. Although I do see their point, I think the reason why somebody would say something like this is because, what the Dude is trying to do is get a new rug, since the two men from the beginning of the film peed on his first one. This, to most people, is not a story worth telling or watching, but the movie is more about the Dudes journey than what he is seeking.
I would recommend The Big Lebowski to anybody looking for a good laugh. The one piece of advice I would give, though, is that if you don't like it the first time give it at least one more chance, if not two chances, all the way through. Because of the films memorable dialogue, ridiculous story, and great acting, I would give The Big Lebowski a whole hearted A+.",1488240000,,4767,4.424829157175399

Really boring movie about and lazy stoner that is filled with stereotypes and only a couple of funny moments.
I kept waiting for it to get good and it only got more and more stupid. A waste of time.
I guess if I was a lazy stoner, I could relate but I'm not so, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
Another sore point for me that a lot of movies make: How can this guy live in a house by himself in L.A. if he has no job and even if he did, he couldn't make enough money to afford it? He should be homeless or have at least 3-4 roommates. Glaring stupidity like this really annoys me.",1487116800,,650,4.0859375

951594,5,6304994540,"Way out west there was this fella... fella I wanna tell ya about. Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. Mr. Lebowski, he called himself ""The Dude"". Now, ""Dude"" - that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'.

They call Los Angeles the ""City Of Angels."" I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I've seen London, and I ain't never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.

  Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw. I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced him enough",1481155200,,1842,4.194915254237288

954721,5,6304994540,"Jeff Bridges slacks like no other!  John Goodman is Carl, a crazy-ass, funny, bipolar megalomaniac that is always making himself feel like someone important, taking charge of the Duder's uninvited, misguided adventures.  This plunges the Dude in even deeper and darker trouble than even he deserves, when Nigelist's mistake Bridges for the prominent, wealthy, philanthropist, that share identical names; Jeffery Labowski!  But Bridges keeps drinking Carl's Krazy Koolaide, regretting his militant bowling buddy's reckless involvement, every time.  The third-wheel, in this trio of lost, California-dreaming, lucky losers, is Steve Buscemi.  He plays Donnie, a lonely but lovable bowling Buddy, who is continually the target of Carl's lambasting, ""SHUT THE F*** UP, DONNIE!"", every time Donnie tries to add to the trio's conversations; which are usually an exchange of hilariously opposing views of mindless, meandering intercourse of the current state of affairs.  This twisted, but totally hilarious, case of mistaken identity, written by one Cohen brother and directed by the other, is CLASSIC COHEN BROTHER'S, bust yer gut laughing fare!  Filmed, IMHO, with trademark Cohen Brother's quirky, dark, contrasting, film noire style moodiness, intertwined with the ever-changing, Cohen Brother like camera angles, usually shot from first-person point of view, that the Cohen Brother's are now famous for!  I suppose, being biased as I am (I love everyone of their movies) influence my review of their efforts.  But, you can't argue against the pile of awards, including those gold, statuesque ones, they have amassed since Blood Simple came out, many moons ago?
  There are too many other, very talented, as well as famous, actors/actresses in Labowski.  I also love Jeff Bridges.  Always have, always will!
So, if you are in the mood for a great dark comedy to stream on the Amazon Fire Box/Stick, on that 3D 4K 70"" OLED Flat Screen, you recently aquired from Amazon Prime, tonight and have never been on a trip in the Dude's world of easy, laid back, unemployed, blunt burnin' bowling and leisure, my suggestion?  Let the Dude abide......  You'll enjoy the ride.....!
P.S.......  Weird, crazy, coincidence?  I reside in Fargo ""Yea, ya betcha"" North Dakota.  The Cohen Brothers grew up in Minnesota.  Their, Oscar worthy (congrat's Marge!) film, ""Fargo"", was not shot in Fargo (not one frame), the opening scene was shot 90 miles north, in Grand Forks, there are scenes in Brainard, MN and Minn/St. Paul, MN.  The actress who plays, used car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard's wife, grew up and lives in Fargo.  I met her at a local T.C.B.Y., wow...  That was over 20 yrs ago.  In ""The Big Lebowski"" they mention a relative that lives in Moorhead, MN, which is Fargo's sister city.  The Red River divides them.  And, finally, Jeff Bridges' wife is from Fargo!  They frequent the city to visit her mother, who still lives here, I believe.  Many ""Dude"" sightings at the local West Acres Mall.
Happy streaming..........",1470787200,,3009,5.214583333333334

Big Lebowski was just not good.  In fact, it was stupid.  Perhaps IF I had finished watching it would have become a great movie, but it was just too much like my memory of ""Dumb and Dumber.""
The complete and utter overuse of the ""F"" bomb made the movie all the worse, all the more boorish.  Now, before you ""Awww, man"" please realize I tried.  I watched for over an hour.  Goodman, who I loved in the other Coen movies, was just so overly simplistic and stupid.  Of course, so was Bridges.
I am struggling right now to remember what the plot was.  It was just stupid.  I stopped watching because it became apparent to me that investing any more time into this crappy movie was a bad investment.  I laughed out loud 2-3 times, but by an hour I could have belly laughed 10x that with the other Coen movies I like.

I've seen many, no all, of the Coen Brothers.  I think this has to be my favorite, closely followed by Fargo.  What makes this film so great is the endurance and quiet optimism that the Dude never seemed to lose.  His world revolves around bowling.  He seems to have no obvious means of supporting himself, but who am I to judge?  There are a number of small, but altogether delightful, little moments with cameos that on your first viewing may pass by without notice.  But, these cuties give us big clues about our character's development and come back later in the story as answers to big questions they posed originally.

You also wonder where this loser of a main character gets the money to live off of from, but that too is sort of endeering. The film seems to ridicule the hero and itself and, well, everything. It would be depressing, except that it's obviously not designed yo be taken seriously. I also think it's a late-eighties to mid-nieties (guessing here) period piece, because it reminds me of Into the Night and Desperately Seeking Susan.",1469232000,,606,4.726415094339623

958482,5,6304994540,"Funniest movie I've ever seen.  Endlessly quotable, and works on different levels.  On the surface it is an old fashioned Raymond Chandler crime story, updated for the slacker 90s, but it is also a brilliant take on Nietzsche's ""Last Man.""  The Dude, played with stony casualness by Jeff Bridges, tries his best to not be involved, to not care, and to not participate in life, but is sucked in anyway by a weird combination of crime and mistaken identity.  Essentially, the Dude wants his floor rug, which was stolen by nihilists, to be replaced because, as he gently puts it, ""It really tied the room together.""  His buddy, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman at the height of his powers), is a damaged Vietnam veteran who is more than willing to enter the fray.  The rules are important to Walter.  We learn this when he pulls a pistol on bowling league compatriot Smokey (Jimmie Dale Gilmore) for crossing the line (literally) during league play.  ""Smokey this is not 'Nam.  This is bowling.  There are rules.""  And when Walter learns that the guys who stole the Dude's rug--the film's inciting incident--are nihilists, the game is really on.  ""Say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos.""  One of my favorite aspects of the plot is that we never do find out where the Dude's rug is.  It doesn't matter.",1467504000,,1343,4.708154506437769

It seems this movie was the inspiration for other movies such as ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and borrowed a lot from ""Dumb and Dumber"".  ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of the best Cohen Brothers movies next to: ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""Burn After Reading"", ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", ""Intolerable Cruelty"", and possibly ""A Serious Man"". There were several scenes of comedic nature (as is usually typical in most Cohen Brothers movies), which were enjoyable.

Where before I found the Dude hapless and enjoyable, now I find him irresponsible and his friend Walter intolerable.  This movie has, I suppose, given me insight into the effect of about the last 15 years.  I am now more grim, and far less inclined to forgive or think funny the various stupidities and crazinesses so well acted by the players.  If you haven't watched this in over 10 years, try it again, just to see;  we all today have seen too many crazinesses end in real tragedies for some of the things we thought funny, then, to seem funny, now.",1466899200,,675,4.352

Now, a decade or so later and after hearing that it is supposed to be a cult classic, I figured I would give it another try to see if I could finally ""see the wisdom"". Unfortunately, I found it even less interesting this second time. Not only were practically none of the characters believable, but I could not relate with or really appreciate any of them. The only real wisdom I noticed in this film was that some characters (The Dude) live life blindly, using drugs and alcohol to blunt their worries, while other characters (most of the others in the film) actively try to use or exploit others without regard for harm caused. Such wisdom is given in much better delivery in countless other movies out there. Hence, I cannot see the value in this film.",1466294400,,843,4.552631578947368

967444,5,6304994540,"The 1998 Coen brothers masterpiece ""The Big Lebowski"" starts off with 'The Dude' (Jeff Bridges) getting his carpet urinated on by one of two rogues who break into his ""house"" looking for money, thus starting off one of the most memorable cinematic rides I have ever witnessed. From 'The Dude's humorous caveats to his slightly psychotic friend Walter (John Goodman) to his various attempts to extricate himself from a kidnapping mystery involving a paralyzed man of the 1 percent (David Huddleston), his feminist daughter (Julianne Moore), and a film director (Ben Gazzara) looking for money from the Big Lebowskis wife (Tara Reid). Through it all, however, The Dude maintains a lovable, stoner attitude and delivers a series of one liners which shall remain forever engraved into your cerebrum. One of the films greatest assets, however, is it's interpolation of elements of film noir, which gives the film a darker edge, evidenced by our leading character's friend Donny (Steve Buscemi) suffering a fatal heart attack. The movie never takes itself to seriously, though, and quickly returns to prime comedic form when Walter accidentally empties Donny's ashes from a Folger's tin onto The Dude. The movie culminates with a mysterious cowboy speaking fondly of The Dude, and hoping that we enjoyed the story. We certainly did, and with this movie and the Coen's other two masterpieces (the twisted ""Fargo"" and the brooding ""No Country For Old Men,"" based on the riveting 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy), it is clear that they should be ranked amongst cinema's great directors Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Ingmar Bergman, Quentin Tarantino, Alfred Hithcock, and Tom Green.",1463270400,,1688,5.232472324723247

Even better: If you liked John Goodman in O Brother, Where Art Thou? you are going to LOVE him in The Big Lebowsky. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Rest In Peace), and David Huddleston--all great! Tara Reid, eh, she was okay, too. The Coen boys sure know how to make a movie.

If cursing isn't your thing, don't bother. They drop the F bomb a lot. In fact, one of my favorite lines is where Sam Elliott says to The Dude, ""You curse too much,"" and The Dude replies, ""What the f*** you talkin' about?""
I saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he said whenever he happens upon this movie while channel surfing, he watches it, and he said, ""That was some good work,"" or something like that. John Goodman and (RIP) Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and believe it or not, Ben Gazarra all turned in stellar performances.

I know people like this and I believe everyone knows a person that acts as a character in this film. Jeff Bridges plays ""The Dude"", a pot smoking, drinking, lazy hippie that gets mixed up in a problem that belongs to another person with the same name of Jeff Lebowski and it gets crazier from there. His story to sort out this issue involves characters that help and hinder him on his path to clear up this mishap. As he tries to clear his name and get restitution for his rug we are introduced to the rest of this films great characters. I recommend watching this if you are in the mood to laugh. John Turturro's character Jesus is great. All few minutes he is in the movie is a treat... John Goodman is a nut that is a gun totting bowling maniac.

There was basically no one in the room and I was sprawled out across several seats. I remember thinking ""this is funny"" but in a way that was consistent and deeper than ""haha."" At that age, I couldn't put my finger on it but the movie appeals to my philosophical sensibilities. It is rich and layered in a way that makes repeat watching a treat. As Lebowski is a man for his time and place, the chronicling of this tale is was certainly for its time and place.

This, of course, is a cult classic, and with good reason for the completely off-the-wall characters and plot. It really doesn't give you much from the standpoint of being anything close to realistic, but is kind of fun in a perverse way. One thing that really aggravated me about this movie and others that do the same, is John Turturro seems to have a penchant for enjoying mocking Jesus and Christians, as in this movie and Box full of Moonshine.",1461196800,,558,4.534653465346534

Then I found that this film had a cult following.  People went to screenings in bathrobes.  What I finally understood about ""the Dude"" is that he is everything you'd dislike about a lazy, dope smoking, Caucasian drinking, throw-back from the 60s but is likable none the less because all he ever wants is his rug back.

975802,3,6304994540,"The best thing about this movie was the guy was called ""The Dude"" it was his persona, his way of life. Always calm, cool, and collected. The Dude!

The Big Lebowski I'd always heard about it but actually never seen the movie.

This type of eclectic Quentin Tarantino type of movie has never really appealed to me. I guess it's an artistic form and there's a lot of movies like this. But really for me they are just B movies, just not A list movies in my in my o-pine. I would never pay to see this kind of movie,  it's not a movie that has to be seen on the big screen.
I'm just saying, it is what it is!

And as a side note if you like profanity then this movie is for you! John Goodman (really they all do but he's the king of the F-bomb in this movie) uses about every cuss word in the book and drops the F-bomb at least a thousand times,,,,,, be forewarned you language aficionados.",1461110400,,886,4.074712643678161

The language was a bit rough, even for the Cohen Brothers, but the movie was pretty funny.  I started to realize something as I was watching it, though.  The more time John Goodman's character spent on screen, the more I realized that I am the Walter Sobchek of my own life.
Sobering.

Obviously, Jeff Bridges had to be at the top of his game, but Every character is well-realized and acted by this all-star cast, including Steve Buscemi, John Goodman, John Turturro, Julianne Moore, David Huddleston, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Sam Elliott, Peter Stormare, - How did the Coen Brothers amass such a wealth of talent for this film? - and a host of others, all giving transcendent performances.  Anyway, this movie takes a case of mistaken-identity to sublimely ridiculous extremes, all the while slyly injecting social commentary into the narrative - speaking of which, Elliott's intermittent narration of the story lends just the right tone.  I don't think it's possible to say much about this film without ruining the expository fun of seeing the plot's - and the screenplay's developments.

This movie drives the point that actors should not wait their turn to speak their lines, speaking over each other is how people talk in reality. You need to watch the movie more than once. I saw this movie the day it was released in the movie theaters and hated it. A year later I purchased the Lazer Disc, (I collect movies even if I don't like them) I watched the movie at least 100 times after that and each time I found the individual characters doing hysterically funny gestures in the background. The character in focus is not always the actor you should be paying attention too. The acting will have you in stitches. Enough said, watch it once and laugh a little, watch it multiple times and be prepared for your face to cramp from laughter and smiling.

Precisely, what is wrong with movies in our era-the bad words, and a mix up within violence as well, a precursor to it.  A shamble in todays movie business.

981995,4,6304994540,"I'm still not sure how to characterize this film, so I'll try to keep it short and sweet, but with this film, I don't think I can.

To the outright disgust of many people I've talked to about it, I'm maintaining this is a pretty mediocre science-fiction film. Give me a chance to explain it to you without boring you to death like the other endless gushing/hating reviews.

""The Stranger"" (Sam Elliott) narrates throughout, and even his introduction tells you right off the bat this is HIS story, and it's his re-telling of it: ""Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Saddam and the Iraqis.""

His main focus, however, is on Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges). Now seeing as how the film was written about that time and filmed in late 1997, why use a cowboy to narrate this film? Because he is a traveler, a literal stranger to the entire film, therefore he has no name and is as removed from the rest of the cast as anyone else could be. Everyone else is from that time, singularly and with a linear time line and time frame.

(It's interesting that a copy of ""Being and Nothingness"" by French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre is on his nightstand near his bed, a remind
er by the Coen Brothers that all of this is nothing, and empty exercise, all created by nothing and going back to nothing. Sartre also wrote a novel titled ""The Stranger,"" about confusion, unresolved feelings and sexual confusion between men and women.)

At one point The Stranger even decides to step in twice: halfway during the movie for a one minute interaction with The Dude at the bar in the bowling alley, to quickly compliment him and to chastise him (""Do you have to use so many cuss words?""), then easy as a summer breeze leaves the frame. In another 1 minute sequence he quickly appears and is happy for The Dude and even goes so far to say take it easy, and then says ""I know that you will,"" to which The Dude says ""The Dude abides,"" then walks away.

It leaves The Stranger to end the film with a monologue about the future, how ""the human comedy keeps perpetuating itself,"" ""across the sands of time until we..."" and then he stops himself. And with that, the film is over.

To be honest, the rest of the film in between the beginning and the end is a farce of sorts, and as the Coen Brothers have said in some interviews it's a tribute of sorts to Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep,"" about double-crossing, the abuse of power and the sudden introductions of absurd characters for distraction purposes. The Dude and his friend Walter (John Goodman) go a little overboard on these points, but it's understandable.

This story is for the benefit of The Stranger, who as the narrator has told it his way, and is relaying it to an audience who accepts his version as the truth. It seems he has told the story before to others and is fascinated with character of The Dude, almost to the point of it being a worship. He even says at the end ""It made me laugh to meet the man.""

Is The Stranger a metaphor and nothing more? Is there a religious theme? Is The Dude a modern-day God and his ""little Lebowski on the way"" on the way his ""only begotten son"" by a woman who has obvious father issues?

It can be said yes, and no, and both, but I still maintain at the center of the film is The Stranger, a Sartre-created no one, to take the whole of the story and shift it and tell it as he sees it, as if only an time traveler could tell it, as only someone who can back up and look at it over and over. Is he from the future, or the past? Does he purposely take on the persona of the American cowboy as the honest hero, to symbolize he is really telling a great story? In the end, does it matter?

Time travel or not, this story leaves a lot more questions than answers, no matter how linear and simple the tale is told, there are so many scenes within the film which almost make zero sense (his hallucinations, the introduction of the German minimalist/porn stars) but within the context of the telling by The Stranger simply work.

There are many versions out there, on DVD, on Blu-Ray, some good, some bad, and apparently a 10th Anniversary ""bowling ball"" case version sucks, so avoid that.

What matters is that you open your mind to what may be one of the most mediocre time-travel movies ever made or an amazing retro romanticist/drama/comedy you've ever looked at. I'll stay with my explanation, it makes the absurdity easier to swallow.",1448668800,,4499,4.412545235223161

982957,5,6304994540,"Be cool, watch this movie. Afterwards ask Yourself if you have any regrets for your watching it.

To understand the sense of what now follows requires you watch the movie.

Of course The Dude abides. A bigger Lebowski is to be had in the other. Bunny Lebowski's presence is the catalyst for the action, whose actions merely spoken of in the story coincidentally brings the two (or maybe it's three...no it's four) Lebowskis together. Another Lebowski, the daughter of the bigger Lebowski, regards The Dude (and it's The Dude and not just Dude) for what ultimately only his gender, and his social-economic situation, can provide her. She values The Dude for what he can donate.

The Big Lebowski's story chronicles The Dude's experience in a world all so familiar yet all so unlike his own. His misadventures might be regarded his ventures into and through an inconsequential world (an underworld) from which he exits the same condition as he entered. For The Dude accepts both worlds, for The Dude abides. In either world The Dude seems to lose nothing for he has nothing to lose except a rug located in the living room ties everything together. Ironically, its absence is the unraveling of The Dude's daily routine. In short order The Dude obtains another rug to replace the other. All things measure and weigh equally for The Dude. Hence, in life The Dude seems to find a sweet-spot of things equaling out for him.

It's hard to say this movie is great because of the Cohen brother's talent or that of Jeff Bridges. Without a doubt both the Cohen's talent and Bridges is the reason for this movie to be ironically American. Besides, undoubtedly The Bid Lebowski is one of the best American ( or even foreign) made cinemas to date, maybe for ever.

To not see The Bid Lebowski is to remain ignorant of one of the many prominent cultural icons of our day.",1442448000,,1855,4.695384615384615

So, you go in with high expectations and perhaps that was my issue. I have to start this off by saying, I LOVE the cast - Steve Buscemi is a favorite of mine, through and through. But it wasn't enough. A lot of the funny parts felt forced, to me. I read some of the other negative reviews and it seems like, for most, they had issues with the swearing. I definitely don't have that problem. This just felt flat and stale. The best parts were the jokes regarding the big Lebowski and the Dude's shared name and the ""lady friend"" bit. John Goodman is a wonderful actor, but the character ... It felt like he was just reading a script. I will say that for the most part, Jeff Bridges did portray his character well. John Turturro looks stellar in those pants, but I had questions as to why they gave his character as much background as they did without him really being necessary to the movie. I could just be taking too much, too hard of a look at the movie and/or perhaps my sense of humor got shot off somewhere, but this was not a film for me.",1438300800,,1156,4.28310502283105

Jeff Bridges is wonderful in this film noir setup of a hapless guy overcome by circumstances. Things are not what they seem.

983699,4,6304994540,"Quick story recap:  The Dude, a slacker nobody who loves bowling with friends, has his life changed when a wealthy man who shares the same last name, has his wife kidnapped.  The Dude finds himself in the middle of everything and trying to solve the mystery.

Jeff Bridges is so good at the Dude.  Almost everyone is fantastic acting wise in this movie.  Phillip Seymore Hoffman is great, and I appreciated the work from John Goodman and Steve Buschemi.

Just a fun movie, a dark comedy at times with some mystery and neat sequences.  They did a good job with this movie.",1435536000,,571,4.53921568627451

983897,5,6304994540,"Finally, I watched the Big Lebowski movie and I know why my husband's, ""the Dude abides"" statement is great! I loved this movie! My husband and I aren't sure whether a younger generation would find it funny, or get it at all. And we really aren't sure if a person who has never gotten high would appreciate it. But having enjoyed the 70s, we also enjoyed this movie. I never lost touch with who I was in the 70s but it truly felt like everybody else had turned their backs on it by the time we reached the 90s. They became responsible Republican citizens who had never touched a drug in their life. Ok, some of them still got high after the kids were in bed... So, to know that the Dude still abides is great news to us from the 70s. He tokes on, despite the changes around him. Vietnam is still acknowledged. The movie is a funny movie that is clearly a 5 for us. I truly hope it is a 5 for younger people and non drug users because I would take that to mean that the Dude really does abide. We would be able to say, "" you're seriously cool, man,"" to the kids raised to think the pursuit of money was the meaning of life, and who would have expected that?",1434153600,,1156,4.119469026548672

984726,5,6304994540,"There is not much more that I can add to others' reviews, but I'll try. The concept -- SoCal noir detective story crossed with stoner movie -- is inspired. The (comedic) execution of this big little movie is brilliant because, of course, it's the Coen Brothers. The cast are all total professionals who, you can tell, are totally committed and utterly believable despite the farcical aspects of the story. Everyone in this movie is ALL IN. That is what makes The Big Lebowski both so great and also so hilarious -- and also surprisingly touching at certain points. The soundtrack is legendary. The visuals are striking. It's a bit over the top at times, but that's part of its charm. Nothing here is wasted; every scene is included for a reason. It's high art and high farce indie film like you've never seen before.

The writing is razor sharp and the direction skillfully navigates between noir and quirky, yet it's totally professional and elevates the entirety to high (farcical) art. Many veteran Coen actors are here, yet in roles like you've never seen them before. The Big Lebowski makes me wonder what Clay Pigeons would have been like, had the Coens directed it. And you don't have to be stoned to enjoy The Big Lebowski -- it is fantastically hilarious, sober or altered.

You owe it to yourself to watch this. Try to forget the hype of it from every Big Lebowski fan who's ever urged you to watch it before you view it, though, or you may be underwhelmed the first time. That being said, it bears repeat viewing -- again and again and again. It just gets better each time -- and with repeat viewings you'll catch the many great lines you didn't hear the first (or third or fifth) time because you were laughing too hard.

One of my top ten favorite films of all time. Never fails to bring a smile to my face, no matter what state I'm in.",1426636800,,1849,4.529940119760479

it's just gotta be seen to understand

for sure and if you don't do drugs

The story goes there are 2 people with the Lebowski name,1 being the dude who gets mistaken for the BIG lebowski. They say ransom is owed in the amount of 1 million dollars. There is mistaken identity that pulls the dude into it,then he gets roped into helping the big Lebowski because he goes & wants a rug that he lost. So the big Lebowski has the dude be the middleman to give the ransom. The craziness gets deeper and deeper as more and more people get involved and at the end you find out that the big Lebowski never wanted his wife back. He is full of himself but the dude and Walter set things straight. An all star cast makes the movie one of the best comedies ever made. Must watch.",1420243200,,1213,4.255411255411255

986184,5,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski (1998) represents the Coen brothers at their hilarious best. It may lack the metaphysical gravitas of Fargo (1995) and the much later No Country For Old Men (2007), but unlike the anarchic and more slapstick Raising Arizona (1987), the outrageous stream of jokes and comic fantasies clearly add up to something - namely a parable on friendship and specifically male camaraderie in a cold hostile world otherwise gone to the dogs. This links the film to Howard Hawks whose greatest films (Only Angels Have Wings [1939], Red River [1948] and Rio Bravo [1959]) are all variations on the same theme. More to the point is The Big Lebowski's relationship with Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946) (joke ref: The Big Sleep/Lebowski - Geddit?) and to the world of Raymond Chandler in general. Enter Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowski as the comic alter-ego of Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe. As the convoluted story involving murder, drugs, prostitution, kidnapping and all things noir strangulates to the point of complete confusion Bogart's Marlowe keeps his head above everything and emerges untarnished to save the day. Elliot Gould's laid-back Marlowe in Robert Altman's ironic and iconic debunking revisionist neo-noir The Long Goodbye (1973) (just like his twin J. J. Gittes in Chinatown from the following year) gets everything wrong and ends up not even being able to save himself. Jeff Bridges' even more laid-back hippy take on the same character gets everything wrong without even knowing what he is supposed to get right in the first place. Over the 2-hour duration of the film his car is stolen, then wrecked, then completely destroyed; his apartment is broken into, then wrecked, then completely destroyed; his person is beaten up, then drugged, then almost completely destroyed. And yet somehow, the Dude confounds the odds and gets to 'abide' another day, and unlike either The Big Sleep or The Long Goodbye, The Big Lebowski leaves us feeling ill at the end through having laughed so much on the journey.

Don't get me wrong, the Dude is no Private Dick. In fact he's a complete slacker, an unemployed left-over from the 60s who wastes his life hanging around chewing the fat with his bowling buddies. They are the meek and mild and none-to-bright Donny (Steve Buscemi who spends the movie being told to shut up without actually saying much - joke ref to the motor-mouth character he played in Fargo) and the aggressive neurotic Vietnam vet with an attitude dysfunction Walter Sobchak (John Goodman in effing and blinding grandstanding form twinned with his role in Barton Fink [1991] - The Big Lebowski was written at that time). The Dude's redeeming quality is his essentially good nature rendered super-cool by an effortless zoned-out marijuana-high performance from Bridges. His great misfortune is his name which he shares with another Jeffrey Lebowski who a gang of intruders come looking for at the beginning of the film. The poor Dude gets beaten up and when they realize they have the wrong man they urinate on his rug as well. Egged on by his self-righteous and trouble-making buddy Walter, the Dude goes to the other Lebowski's house which turns out to be a mansion (think Bogey visiting the Sternwoods at the beginning of The Big Sleep). We meet Lebowski's assistant (an effete Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Lebowski himself (David Huddleston) who turns out to be a millionaire Korean vet. Wheelchair-bound (just like Mr. Sternwood), he dismisses the Dude as a bum. The Dude takes a rug anyway and on his way out meets Lebowski's young model trophy wife (Tara Reid) who offers to blow him for a thousand bucks - ""I'll just go to the cash machine"", he says on leaving. Turns out the girl is kidnapped and Lebowski recalls the Dude wanting to hire him as bagman. From here the plot spirals into The Big Sleep-like labyrinthine complexity, which is OK 'cos the plot's not important anyway (so say the Coens). This turns out to be a disingenuous disclaimer (one of many MacGuffins), the film's best feature turning out to be its extraordinarily inventive story-telling.

What initially seizes the attention here is the gallery of Fellini/Pynchon-esque grotesques that parade before us as we play the 'spot-the-star' game. There's Julianne Moore in the Lauren Bacall role as a vaginal visual artist who makes a spectacular nude entrance swinging on a trapeze. Her clearly enunciated Brit-accent English is a joke ref to another contemporary film (this time The End of the Affair). There's John Turturro as Jesus Quintana, a perverted child molester of Cuban extraction who performs to camp excess as he polishes his balls and struts in front of the Dude and his gang (check out those pelvic thrusts, man!) in the bowling alley. Then there's David Thewlis (virtually unrecognizable) as a hyper-ventilating 'video artist' with a fit of the giggles, Jon Polito as a down-at-heel gumshoe, Peter Stormare as one of three Nazi/Nihilists who speaks with the affected cod-German accent he used on the set of Fargo (but who never actually said anything on screen during that film), Ben Gazzara as a rich silky-smooth pornographer introduced at a Malibu beach house party via a bare-breasted trampoline artist (dig the gossamer balls there, man!) to the Henry Mancini song ""Lujon"". Finally, there's Sam Elliot playing an old cowboy who offers the traditional Raymond Chandler third-party perspective on the whole narrative and who gets to voice straight to camera the film's moral.

The film's mise-en-scne is cued by the main setting, the bowling alley, and as we travel through the various strata of L. A. society (another Chandler feature) trying to keep up with the Dude and his adventures everything is shot (by Coen regular Roger Deakins) to be plasticky and bright with a well chosen (by T-Bone Burnett) playlist of rock songs mainly from the 60s ranging from Creedence Clearwater Revival through to Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Bob Dylan, the Stones and to a Gipsy Kings' cover version of `Hotel California'. Most bizarrely entertaining of all are fantasy sequences covering the many occasions the Dude is knocked out, drugged and otherwise abused, the best of them being a huge dance number referencing Busby Berkeley, the Powell-Pressburger stairway to Heaven from A Matter of Life and Death (1946 - the same year as The Big Sleep!), and many more as the Dude sails down a bowling lane beneath the spread legs of showgirls with a ridiculous grin on his face as we hear ""Just Dropped in (to See What Condition My Condition Was In)"" by Kenny Rogers. Much of the comic inspiration here is inspired (too inspired to be spoiled by me relating it all to you) and there's even a possible allegory of the then-current Gulf War lying within much of what Walter says and a guest appearance by Sadam Hussein himself. Oh, and there's an extremely moving cliff-top funeral oration that will have you crying...

The Big Lebowski plays bright, fast, furious and doesn't bother much with believability, but when the crowd has moved on and the shouting is over we are left with a man whose life was made difficult by his buddies (especially Walter), but who learns that without them he would be no different from the rest of the selfish money-grubbing characters we meet throughout the film. In fact without his friends he would be nothing at all.

The film wasn't successful when it first came out, but it has since garnered cult status as have many of the Coens' films. They are without doubt alongside Terrence Malick America's pre-eminent film-makers today. Martin Scorsese might surprise us in the future with something fresh, but I guess his best years (and films) are well behind him now. P. T. Anderson is another director to reckon with and his up-coming Thomas Pynchon adaptation Inherent Vice may well provide direct comparison with The Big Lebowski. We will see...",1418774400,,7873,4.984030418250951

When you asked them what's the morale or theme of the story, they won't know. They'll try to explain and you'll lose interest. The Coen bros have proved they are the biggest nihilist in cinema. This movie is their last swan song before really getting mired down in heavy god-less movie making whereby you want to slit your wrists after leaving the theatre: ""No Country for Old Men"" I'm looking in your direction. The Big Lebowski still has a little hope for humanity, a little understanding that it's okay to be loser, as long as you are still decent to people. But why is the character Jesus in there? Why bother with a narrator? is their a character arc to the hero? Probably not. The Coen bros never read Joseph Campbell. Maybe that's okay for this movie. But in my opinion, for the Coen Bros.

Joel and Ethan Cohen really allow an incredible cast to just ACT and it comes through in a movie that I am sure has exceeded the expectations of everyone involved.  With a great, wandering plot and a number of infamous one liners, TBL is a must-see for Achievers (and proud we are of all of them) and non-Achievers alike.  One of the best aspects of this movie is that it is a top rate production where you get that small, independent film feel despite, or possibly IN-spite of the big production backing. The references and one-liners have led to a cult following vis-a-vis www.dudeism.com, and simultaneously speak on an Animal House level and as far as you want to take it philosophically.  A lotta ins, lotta outs, a lotta what have you.  A technicolor neo-noir.  You can overthink it or just enjoy it for the patent excellence it demonstrates.  ...

986756,3,6304994540,"This movie is full of good moments, and I can see why it's a beloved cult classic for that reason. But as a story--even a goofy, comical one--it's lacking. Lacking it's whole second half, the way it feels. Or at least it's climax and closure.

I was engrossed in the story, and the weird goofy atmosphere; and then, suddenly, the movie just ended. Ended right after a rather gut-wrenching scene which--while beautifully done--wasn't nearly relevant enough to justify being the cilmax (if that's what it was supposed to be). And then they skip right to the closing scene, before the audience has had any time to get over this character's death, while acting as if it's ending on an uplifting note. I don't object to a lovable supporting character dying; but you can't just end the movie with that, at least not with this type of story. The death would have worked fine had it happened earlier in the movie--even just a few scenes earlier--but on the final note? It was left-field, both in terms of the plot and the movie's tone.

I *do* recommend this movie to fans of Steve Buscemi and John Goodman, as well as fans of weird cult movies. But, don't get your hopes up for anything fantastic. Expect to have fun for two hours, and then suddenly get a slap in the face.",1415664000,,1266,4.548245614035087

987200,2,6304994540,"I saw this movie advertised 14 years ago, and I read some favorable reviews more recently.  Finally, seeing it for sale for $5, I bought it.  I spent two hours watching this cruddy flick; it was two hours wasted.

It's a movie about a worthless slacker, an unemployed druggie (Lebowski, alias the Dude) who is the prey of several groups of gangsters because of a case of mistaken identity.  The Big Lebowski is a phony tycoon married to a jailbait tramp.

None of the characters are worth a damn, except for a mysterious stranger, played by Sam Elliot, who shows up now and then to make pithy comments.  The story goes nowhere, and the Dude ends up not much worse for the wear, but no better either, at the end of the two hours.  Michelangelo Antonioni did this sort of thing better in 1966 with Blow-Up.

Save your $5 and save two hours of your life.  Remember that your time is limited; once it is wasted, you will never get it back.",1412985600,,935,4.3895348837209305

Also, Julianne Moore turns in the worst performance of her career, even as throwaway schtick, and consigning Steve Buscemi to an annoyingly repetitive running joke is just a waste. The Jeff Bridges and John Goodman characters are icons, of course, so the movie needs to be seen for those seeking American cultural literacy.

Jeff Bridges in my opinion man..........is so good in this role, it almost doesn't seem like acting. Seems like it's just three dudes hanging out, bowling, having some beers. Jeff feels very organic as the Dude, or Duder, or Dudarino.
John Goodman is spot on as the loudest, dip S**T at the bar.",1408838400,,442,4.337349397590361

987958,3,6304994540,"Not Coen&Coen at their best, but even on an off-year, they still do passably.  The story itself is amusing, clever, unpredictable - but as ""the Stranger"" points out, ""too many curse words,"" as in, every 3rd word is the F-word, and it's overkill.  Aside from that (and it's not easy to overlook, unless you happen to talk that way yourself, in which case: get therapy), the story and the acting are fine, and, typically of Coen&Coen, we really do believe these slobs actually exist.  Thanks to the main character, ""the Dude,"" being a stoner, we get a few dream/fantasy sequences, which seem to be spoofing both MTV and the lavishly choreographed musicals of the 1930s.  We meet NO nice people in this universe, just cuckoos and losers - but, at times the movie is almost like a Christian sermon: there are no ""losers"" in God's universe, even the stoners and nut cases deserve a little sympathy.  John Goodman steals the show as the warped (but amazingly charismatic and masculine) Vietnam Vet, Walter, but it was funny seeing a few familiar faces from the old days, like David Huddleston and Ben Gazzara. Julianne Moore has a funny (and menacing) role as a slightly cracked artiste, John Turturro is creepy in a brief but highly memorable turn as a Hispanic bowler (and pedophile).  Red herrings are present (typical Coen&Coen), and the scene with kid and the red Corvette is a hoot.  What a shame that the improv feel of the whole thing resulted in an overly generous use of obscenity.  Coen&Coen can write very smart dialogue, so they can do better than this.

Not in the same league as Fargo or the endearing O Brother, Where Art Thou?, but it's watchable - you'll either turn it off after 10 minutes, or watch the whole thing (while keeping the kids out of the room, unless they hear the F-word from you all the time, in which case: shame on you).",1407715200,,1850,4.63302752293578

This is a truly horrible movie and a huge disappointment!  I expected so much better from the producers of Fargo.  Jeff Bridges does nothing worthwhile.  John Goodman is a foul-mouthed bully - totally unlikable.  Julianne Moore is such a major disappointment with a truly weird role.  I wish I had never seen her in this movie.  She is one of my favorite actresses, but this role is so over-the-top and unattractive.  I always look forward to anything Steve Buscemi does, but he had almost no role whatsoever.  How did they manage to make him boring?  The funniest and best roles/actors in the entire film were the supporting cast.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the best thing in the film.  He always gives a great performance.  The cops who took Jeff Bridges stolen car report, and the cop who gives the car back to him, are funny.  They are more impressive by far then any of the lead actors.  There is no plot, no humor, no dialogue, nothing to make this movie worth watching.  Sam Elliot said it all when he said they use the ""f"" word too much.  This movie would have been so much better with an actual scrip!  My husband and I actually walked out of the movie theatre 15 minutes before the end.  We have never done that before.  I am only sorry we didn't walk out 15 minutes after it began.  I am embarrassed I was there at all.  The actors should feel humiliated they were associated with this film.  I am just amazed the producers got away with it.

988518,3,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski is an . . . odd film, to say the least, and thats pretty much universally agreed upon. The key element here is, then, does its oddness appeal to you personally? If it does, youll love this movie. If it doesnt, youll probably end up hating it, or at the least be very, very confused.

The Cohen brothers have a history of odd, artsy films that can be funny as well as confusing. This comedy (and it is a bit of a stretch to label it as such) is a cult-classic from 1998. It follows the story of Jeffery The Dude Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges, an unemployed amateur bowler and professional slacker, as he gets mixed up in a complicated case of kidnapping and mistaken identity, among many other things. Trying to explain the narrative beyond that is a Herculean task in and of itself, as its complication surpasses even Dan Brown or Nolan levels. In one sense, its a slice-of-life tale about the Dude, but its a particularly strange slice here. A lot of things happen, not always related to each other or even in a logical sequence. That, though, is where most of the comedy comes in this film; the sheer oddity of the situations, the characters, and most importantly, those characters reactions to those situations.

I would not say that for me personally, that this film was hilarious, but I also wouldnt say it was terrible either, as I did laugh quite a bit during. This really is one of those films that is experienced and liked on a person-to-person basis. There is a lot here that is pointless: some characters, most dialogue, several scenes and sequences; all of which adds up to essentially nothing. But this films lack of a point is the point itself. This is great if this works for you, but disastrous if it doesnt.

Bridges is great as the Dude, and it was one of those performances where it was so good, it seems like it wasn't really acting and that is what the actor is really like. Hes likable in his own loserly way. John Goodman plays the Dudes best friend Walter, who is immediately unlikable; you wonder why the Dude puts up with him. The rest of the actors and characters, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julliane Moore, Tara Reid, Steve Buscemi, are all memorable in their own eccentricities but episodic in their appearances and unimportant in their significance. Again though, their pointlessness is their point. There are other good things to be had in this film. The cinematography is really good and creative in some spots, particularly in the dream sequences, which are arguably the best scenes in the film.

Its like I said, this film is best taken on an individual basis. I can see why some people like it, and I can also certainly see why some people hate it. Personally, I liked it well enough; I don't love it, and certainly wouldnt rank it among my favorite films or even comedies, but its far from terrible; it was entertaining enough to find amusing. You may like its strangeness and eccentricity; you may hate its pointlessness and unfocused narrative. You may love its memorable and quirky characters; you may hate its confusing structure. Take it at your own pace. Like it or not, either way, Im sure the Dude will abide.",1401235200,,3171,4.597173144876325

988520,5,6304994540,"I think more than anything else about ""the Dude,"" it is his capacity to simply not give a s*** about the things that really don't matter that have earned him his cult following. These are uncertain times, and even were back when the Coen Brothers made this film in 1998. This film is a classic that has a cult following and a documentary film made about the phenomenon of The Big Lebowski ""Achievers."" This is fine directing that can be observed in the artistry of much of the camerawork, but especially in the larger than life unique and fascinating characters. John Goodman is at his best, and the scenes with John Tuturro's ""Jesus"" character are something not to be missed.

In particular, John Goodman's psychotic neo-con Walter has become a common sight in many parts of Amefican life and politics, and sadly, the tolerant, peaceful, and philisophical Dude has become even more of an endangered species than he was in the 90s. One of the Coen Brothers' most effective tricks is to present what are essentially stereotypes in a way that is both endearing and insightful (think about Margie from ""Fargo"", Brad Pitt's vane and ignorant character in ""Burn After Reading"", and everyone in ""Oh, Brother..."" and their brilliant early film ""Blood Simple"")-and to see how these characters evolve and function in their own cultural contexts.

988848,5,6304994540,"The closest thing I can think of to ""The Big Lebowski"" is Wilde's ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" Both have things that look like plots . . . but plot isn't the point. They have things that look like characters who represent social types . . . but that isn't the point. They both tempt you to consider that they might be social satire . . . but that doesn't seem to explain their charm. What they are are aesthetic constructions that have their own rhythm and shape -- they don't ""represent"" anything -- and for that reason, they are much more like pieces of music or dance than anything else. Our involvement with them is wholly aesthetic, and the pleasures they afford are aesthetic pleasures -- the pleasures of appreciating a self-sustaining pattern. We don't ""care"" about the characters -- we enjoy watching them jump through the hoops of Joel and Ethan Coen's construction. The Coen brothers have always been prone to genre-bending and playing with expectations and conventions, but here they go the whole hog and cut themselves loose from representation altogether.

The film gives us hints about how we are to take it -- in the dream sequences (and don't tell me that they are to be taken seriously as representations of trips), in the formulaic, leitmotivic language of Walter (John Goodman) -- and don't tell me that his language is to be taken as a representation of a disturbed Vietnam vet -- in the totally abstract art of Maud (Julianne Moore), whose insistence that her art is ""vaginal"" is, of course, a joke, and in the visual leitmotivs of the bowling alley scenes. The figures of Jesus (John Turturro) and the Stranger (Sam Elliot) also are presented in ways that patently defy ""realistic"" representations of anything. Just ask yourself: where does the Stranger get his authority as a storyteller about a ""story"" set in modern LA, and you realize that that's a question that has no answer, because we're not in the world of questions and answers. Through all this shambles The Dude (Jeff Bridges), an anarchic spirit who simply points up the high artificiality of the cinematic context through which he shambles. He's as aimless and unrepresentative (and unemployed) as the young men in Wilde's play -- his ""meaning"" is simply what he contributes to the dance or tone-poem that is the film. With art this ""pure"" there are only two possible responses -- dismiss it as trivial because it's ""unreal,"" or admit that ALL art is unreal at some level and just enjoy the kind of pleasure that art as art affords.",1395619200,,2525,4.764840182648402

I think Jeff Bridges is an amazing actor. I also must state that I have had several friends spout out quotes and endearments about this movie for as long as I can remember.

With that being said, I purchased this movie on Amazon and sat back to be awed! I wasn't. Sure there were some funny parts, some decent one liners, but maybe I just didn't get it. This is one of those movies I have no idea how became a cult classic. I will say, in my opinion, it's way better than Napoleon Dynamite, but then again maybe I didn't get that one either.

The thugs are frightening and inept. I'll probably watch it over time a few more times to try and figure out the plot, figure out where the scam is and why Jeff Bridges isn't bumped off.

(pause for mocking laughter to subside).

I know, I know.  How can any self-respecting thirty-something actually admit to never having watching The Dude.  So, here's the deal.  I've never actually admitted that before.  I always smiled and laughed along whenever people mentioned the movie or quoted from its lines.  I always nodded knowingly whenever anyone referenced The Dude or 'What makes a man'.

IFC played this movie the other night and I decided that it was time for me to man up and watch.  See what all the fuss was about.

And I did.

Now, for anyone who wants a movie with a clearly delineated beginning, middle and end, this is not for you.  Try something with Kate Hudson, preferably under the title 'Rom-Com'.

No, this is for someone that just wants to be taken on a joyous, raucous ride with incredible talented performers.  Because that's really what John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Buscemi are in this movie.  Beyond mere actors reading lines they are performers, performing their roles.

I have friends who do dialogue from Monty Python, Animal House, Ferris Bueller, Smoky and the Bandit, Fargo, Pulp Fiction etc
Add this movie to that list where the more you recite, the more you laugh
Buying a rug and decorating your house will never be the same. You'll have to laugh.
Bowling will never be the same.

The Big Lebowski IS my favorite movie of all time. There is just something about the dry jokes, characters and their backstories, and how everyone interacts with one another. There are hundreds of lines dialogue in this movie that I use with my close friends on a nearly daily basis. Not to mention I have had random people use Dude quotes on me, not knowing I'm an Achiever (a self-implied name for a die hard Lebowski fan).

Just trust me on this one, watch this movie. Sometimes it take 2 or 3 views to really start getting into it, but before you know it you'll be a Little Lebowski Urban Achiever much like myself.

Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up.

At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. Mr. Lebowski, he called himself ""The Dude"". Now, ""Dude"" - that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. They call Los Angeles the ""City Of Angels."" I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I've seen London, and I ain't never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw.

So I got it on Amazon and anticipated viewing it....It was.....okay. Maybe the problem is that I had expectations based on the mystique and word of mouth. I found some parts really funny. I found some things a little...""meh.""...There were some areas where the performances were outstanding. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't near what I was expecting.

This is a movie has developed a cult following over the years. If you like other movies by the Coen brothers, you will like the Big Lebowski. Other Coen brothers movies are: Blood Simple, Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou?, No Country for Old Men, True Grit, Raising Arizona, The Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink, Burn After Reading. If you like more than one of these movies, you may begin to understand why The Big Lebowski has developed a very large cult following, growing to include the Lebowski Fests held throughout the country

I won't discuss The Big Lebowskis story, plot points, artfulness, or other classic critic bullet points, other than to say that it is loosely based on the 1946 Humphrey Bogart / Lauren Bacall film The Big Sleep. While The Big Sleep is a classic gumshoe story, The Big Lebowski is a comedy. I will also touch on the fact that the acting is great.

As mentioned above if you like other Coen brothers movies, you will like The Big Lebowski on the first time seeing it, but like many Coen brothers stories, you have to watch many times over to get all the little nuances that make their movies great.

This review is about Amazon customer service.

Be careful with these ""digital copies"" that come with movies.  It's not just a simple download.  You don't just go to the website shown on the redemption slip and download your movie.  In fact, as far as I can see, you never physically possess a digital copy, unless you can rip it as it is streaming or something.  No, the redemption site asks you to choose a vendor and then you get a redemption code for that vendor.  Then you go to that vendor with your code and this gets your movie delivered to your library, not to your computer.  If all goes well, that is.

I chose Amazon, since that's where I bought the boxed set.  My ""digital copy"" redemption did not go well, however -- I got charged 10 bucks.

I immediately emailed customer service with a complaint.  Bright & early next morning was a reply from an actual person, who said that I'd been charged because the expiration date for the ""free digital copy"" had expired.  This was in July.  I explained that the expiration date shown on the redemption slip in the boxed set was Dec. 31, 2013, and that if there was some sort of mix-up it was not at my end, but rather a miscommunication between Amazon and Universal (the movie company).

The customer service gal apologized for the inconvenience, immediately credited my account, and simultaneously fired me off a good Amazon redemption code for the movie.  Now, anyone can make a mistake (the botched redemption code), but fixing a mistake so quickly and painlessly for the customer is fine service, if you ask me.  Kinda old-fashioned in today's world, but I'm an old-fashioned kind o' guy.

You are not ""out of your element"" with Amazon's customer service.",1376352000,,1792,4.610759493670886
990530,5,6304994540,"Before I commence with the awarding of Bowling for Movies score on The Big Lebowski, I thought I would share a bird's eye view of the process.  If you've read any of our other movie reviews you'll know we use an elaborate method, utilizing modern technology and a special blend of both quasi aaaaand pseudo-science.  While I can't confirm that this ""secret formula"" for rendering movies into a comprehensive bowling score resides in a safety deposit box in a major New York bank - I can share with you that I hit the googlemachine (you know, it runs on the innerwebs, it's pretty technical) for reviews, comments, and critic's opinions.  I spend hours contemplating not just my opinion, but Mrs. Lady Movie-Dude's, and Little Miss Movie-Dude's (where appropriate).  It's an intensive process designed to check and recheck every aspect of the review process so that you, faithful Amazon review reader, get the most genuine, the most accurate, the most dependable movie review possible.  We here in the Thomason house know that reviewer/review reader's opinion won't always see eye to eye but the hope is you will see the time and love we lavish on the reviews.

To date, no movie has ""bowled"" a perfect game.  A down side to the process is we watch movies and then discuss what went wrong - it can interfere with the post movie glow.  Critical analysis is, well, critical and being critical by its very nature, negative.  It forces you to take off the rose-colored glasses and see things for what they really are.  We feel this walking on the darker side of cinema is worth it in the end because of the insight it brings.  What movie could stand up to that sort of microscopic scrutiny?  Well, frankly - none - until now:

The Big Lebowski Bowling for Movies Score... 300 of 300!!!  A perfect score!!!

Long Story Short:
Aging hippie, who lives for bowling, becomes intertwined in a ransom plot gone wrong due to an identity mix up - ...""let me explain something to you, uh, I am not Mr. Lebowski - YOU, are Mr. Lebowski.  I'm The Dude...""  One strange episodic adventure leads to the next and a million dollars goes missing, a gun is pulled on the lanes, and a cowboy known simply as The Stanger gets a decent soft-drink.

Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro star in a Cohen brother's masterfully written and directed script which was nearly universally ignored by audiences (hey, 90's cinema was pretty easy to ignore).  This movie has mystery, comedy, irony, it's total fiction yet comes off as 100% authentic.  The characters are richly painted and serve as perfect archetypes living in an equally realistic microcosm inhabited by stoners, Vietnam vets, surfer dudes, pronographers, and hyper-militant feminists.  I originally picked this flick up off the Blockbuster shelf back in the day (which was a Thursday) purely because ""Hey, that's the dude from Tron"" (we're from California originally, by way of explaining the many dude's in my native tough).  What followed was a far out journey into the far reaches of The Dude's world.  From a reviewer's point of view this movie is perfectly acted, perfectly scripted, perfectly scored.  The Cohen brothers threw out The Real Deal and not just a ""ringer"" full of dirty underwear.

What I liked:
- Bridges' portrayal as the laziest person in Los Angeles County - he transforms into the most laid-back zen hippie dude and evolved into a very un-dude stress monger as the events unfold... and back to his personal center seamlessly
- If the script is the heart of the movie, the soundtrack is the soul providing the perfect emotional backdrop throughout - from CCR to Kenny Rogers, Bob Dylan to Captain Beefheart; I hate the Eagles but Hotel California in Spanish was simply perfect for Jesus to make his appearance
- The comedy is unforced but flows naturally and organically as these strong personalities collide as the plot's arching mystery bring strangers together under strange circumstances.
- The dream sequences... dude, need to been seen to believed

Who would NOT enjoy this film in my humble opinion:
- People who are allergic to laughing - could cause a serious rash
- People who are overtly uptight - you know who you are (you probably marked it 1 star)
- People who think America peaked in the 1950s
- Rush Limbaugh (what else needs to be said)

Hey, have any question about this movie review??  Drop a comment and I will try to respond as quickly as possible.  Bowling for Movies was in no way shape or form compensated for the review.  Wondering how your favorite movie would score - just ask, if I got it - you'll get it!  And remember, The Movie Dude Abides :]",1376352000,,4668,4.761490683229813

So many problems just from a scriptwriting perspective: the unnecessary voiceover at the start, telling us The Dude is nobody worthy of your time or attention. The lack of character growth of anyone in the movie. The convoluted kidnapping plot could have been used more, but wasn't. There were completely unnecessary fluff in the movie too, like the PI in the beetle. Just watch the first few scenes. Do you like any of the characters? Do you have any reason to watch it? No.

as a man of some repute who is married to a young chippy. One of them is essentially broke and relaxes at the bowling alley; the other is an older man administering a family trust. Others come looking for their money and mistake the Dude for the one who has the money.
John Goodman's character is fabulously acted and Jeff Bridges as ""the Dude"" is perfect. Julianne Moore is great as Maude, and John Turturro portrays a rival bowler to perfection.

""Way out west there was this fella I wanna tell ya about. Goes by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. See, this Lebowski, he called himself ""The Dude"". Now, ""Dude"" - there's a name no man would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. See, they call Los Angeles the ""City Of Angels""; but I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow it as there are some nice folks there. 'Course I ain't never been to London, and I ain't never seen France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd seen in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? Sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here - the Dude from Los Angeles. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in all of Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. Sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Well, I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced it enough. """,1368144000,,2006,4.21038961038961

991604,5,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski is an outstanding film from the Coen Brothers.  Given only modest reviews by Main Stream Media court-reviewers it has since become a cult classic.

The movie picks up on a Baby Boomer theme also described in Forrest Gump, that perhaps the way to achieve a spiritual mastery is no through active efforts-but passive ones.  Forrest Gump himself is stupid but goes through life as a sort of dull witted Caine in Kung Fu-he helps people, spiritually, materially, and physically by not over-thinking.  Forrest Gump can't over-think as he is dumb, but Lebowski is perfectly capable mentally but has no ambition.  Like Kung Fu's Caine however, he helps others with their problems...to a point.

We meet Lebowski, or ""The Dude"" at the onset of the Gulf War.  He is beaten by toughs, one of whom, a Chinaman, pees on his rug.  This sets of a chain of events where the Dude meets a producer of pornographic films, a Republican Reaganite Millionaire-the other Lebowski, a modern art feminist painter, and ""The Jesus.""

John Goodman plays Walter Sobchak, a Shabbes Goy American and Nam Vet.  In many ways this character is a personification of many of the former Reagan Republican foreign policies as they were forming into Neo-conservatism the 1990's. Walter Sobchak is aggressive, overbearing, takes great faith in simple solutions, but is lacking nuance and judgment.

The Dude abides through the entire movie, tying up loose ends throughout...sort of.  An ironic look at LA, America, and the endgame of the Hippie revolution.",1366761600,,1534,5.019762845849803

I'm not sure whether I enjoyed the movie more, or watching these doofuses roll around on the furniture and floor laughing hysterically more.  (Okay, that *may* be a bit of an exaggeration, but whatever. They still loved watching the movie.)

Basically, I thought the movie had really funny parts, parts that left me befuddled as to relevance, and parts that I wished it were me that was drinking a White Russian.  I also understood why the males in my house loved this movie so much: The Dude handled problems the way many men do, which is basically a LOT more simply than many females.

so i re watched it and was enthralled. the dude's attitude toward life, his ability to let go of things and remain cool is inspiring. something i couldn't see when i was young. to be an adult and maintain his attitude on life is a really amazing feat! i'm now a drug and alcohol free devout buddhist and i saw a whole different film! i have lots of responsibilities and am always trying to focus on the dhamma to keep my mind free but i was too uptight with my overall attitude, watching this movie inspired me to relax a lot more.

do i agree that the dude is a zen master? um... no, i do not. he smokes pot and drinks alcohol all day, lies, and speaks harshly.
i suppose the dude could be the 70's definition of a hippie zen master though he is not a zen master in the classical sense.

could he be a taoist master? sure, why not, that is an extremely vague concept so pinning it down is nearly impossible. read the tao te ching and some chuang tzu. they're all over the place! the dude could fit right in a story from the chuang tzu no problem!

however are there zen elements in the film? definitely! the whole attitude of just letting everything go is very zen. especially of not taking things personally, being neutral and non violent, living in the moment and not over thinking things. i mean they are in a heap of trouble and decide to go bowling! that's very zen lol!

very great film. i'm picking up the new book from the library today. ""the dude and the zen master"" jeff bridges and bernie glassman. after reading an interview i now think jeff is probably a really cool guy in real life and this bernie glassman guy sounds like a class act, a real example of zen! both are people i would like to learn more about.",1360540800,,1934,4.258855585831062

Don't misconstrue me to saying this is like a Stooges movie; rather that both are a ""you do or you don't taste.""

An obviously great cast, with a few wry laughs, but seemingly weird for weirdness' sake.  Plus, it has all the swearing of a Tarantino film without the truly great dialogue (that some of his movies have).  If I'm going to be beaten over the head with the language of the docks/high-school, at least give me some substance to go with it.

992540,5,6304994540,"For some reason, the Coen brother's ""The Big Lebowski"" is often labelled a cult hit. Let's see, hmm. I know two dozen people who have seen this great film. Each of those people know two dozen other people who love it. And so on... and so on... As of this writing, over 900 people have written reviews of it. To me, it is too wildly popular to earn the status ""cult"" which would indicate a lack of popularity among the general film-going audience. Perhaps it has a cult status because people recite lines by heart, or worship certain characters, a la ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Perhaps. And, ultimately, it doesn't matter. This is a gut-hurting, laugh out loud movie that has a wide audience that just gets wider with each passing year.

I won't go over the plot (since you have about 900 other reviews covering that), suffice to say that there are as many twists and turns and twisted characters populating this world to keep you more than entertained. As strange as some of the film is, nothing seems beyond the scope of reality. In fact, the Coen brothers have a great talent for making the strange seem real and reality seem bizarre. ""The Big Lebowski"" is classic Coen brothers, in this regard. Added to that, you have a monster cast who not only perform superbly, they seem to be enjoying themselves. Bridges, Goodman, Buscemi and Moore push the comic envelope without going over-the-top. (John Turturro's relatively small part is a hilarious gem.)

It's hard to believe that 15 years have gone by since I first saw this great film. And unlike other comedies of the late '90s, this one holds up. Laugh for laugh, nothing has gotten stale with age. Now kids who were just born when this film came out are howling with laughter at it. As The Stranger (played by Sam Elliott) intones,  ""I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself."" This could apply to the growing, not-cult fan base for ""The Big Lebowski"".",1358467200,,1949,4.659883720930233
992541,5,6304994540,"No need to review the movie itself, it's been out for long enough and has a large cult following; there's nothing I can say about it that hasn't been more eloquently stated before. I'm a sucker for cool packaging, and Blu-ray Books are second to only Steelbooks in my opinion. The full color pages are high quality paper and filled with great photos and trivia. The Blu-ray transfer is good, but could have been better. Night/dark scenes are a little muddy/messy looking, and the movie overall isn't very vibrant. The picture quality is still great (the best Lewbowski has ever looked) and a huge leap over the DVD version, but it's not the kind of quality where you'd use this movie to show off your new HDTV, either.

I honestly had no interest in seeing this movie until I heard other people referring to lines from this movie in normal conversation. I thought to myself ""there has to be something about this movie, everyone is always talking about it.""

Its FUNNY! It actually gets funnier as you watch it for the 4th or 5th time. John Goodman is hysterical.

""I got friends that died face down in the muck!""

One of the funniest parts in this movie is when the Dude goes to Jackie Treehorn's house. He overhears a private conversation Jackie is having on the phone. Jackie is taking notes on the call and then excuses himself from the room. The Dude runs over to the pad and uses a pencil to outline the notes from Jackie's secret call, but it turns out he only doodled a cartoon of a naked guy with a huge..... well you get the point. The dude is constantly let down yet everything always works out for him. He comes up with these great ideas but they all turn out to be stupid, yet everyone looks up to him like he's Jesus reincarnated.

His car starts off as a piece of junk and somehow or another gets worse and worse through the entire film. HAHA!

You will laugh at the whole movie, be quoting movie scenes, and wonder if the Dude is a complete moron or the smartest guy on the planet. The dude hears quotes and fancy language from other people throughout the movie then tries to use them in his own context but they never come out right.

993016,4,6304994540,"I don't watch many movies anymore. Rarely does anything look interesting enough to me that I can be persuaded into the effort, minimal as it may be, to devote a couple of hours and my attention to a much hyped feature.

For years I have been hearing references to ""The Big Lebowski"" in various forms without even realizing it. The John Goodman line about ""proper nomenclature"" struck me right between the eyes as I knew I had innocently been subjected to that reference more than a handful of times.

I really never had any interest in the film when it was released. It sounded fairly idiotic and wasn't heralded as a masterpiece by those that get paid to steer me away from making the tremendous effort required to enjoy a movie.

It wasn't until years after the fact that I began to hear more and more people chastise me subsequent to a period of shock and disbelief when I informed them that I had never seen the film. I didn't want to. The same people that seemed to be enfatuated with ""Lebowski"" were those same people that reveled in using their pinky finger to mimic Mike Meyers' character in that dreadful ""shagalicious"" detective bore. Flavor-of-the-month-hipster films with trendy catch phrases and temporarily memorable characters spawned from stereotypes or outlandishness get top billing on my list of ""Must Avoid At All Cost"" films.

""Lebowski"" jumps right into what I feared most and I nearly regretted allocating effort for this endeavor as we meet Goodman's character, an amalgamation of hypocrisy as defined primarily by his apparent ""neo-con"" delivery. The bizzare pedophilic latino as portrayed by Turturro. The heartless ""fat cat"" that shares his name with the title character - a man that is diametrically opposite as a fully functioning, but decidedly and intentionally sub-functional, ambitionless, cashless, borderline bum (not proper nomenclature, I know). Other than sitting, walking, taking a bath, drinking, or smoking a joint - Lebowski is rarely seen doing anything himself at any point - he doesn't even bowl in a movie that is set predominately in a bowling alley and is by all accounts, Lebowski's only actual social activity.

Within fifteen minutes, I am already thinking- ""Oh grand, another pointless movie posing as satire with a bunch of cartoonish characters that will inevitably leave you trying to figure out what the point of the movie is"".

So, every time something happens, a word is spoken, I'm putting meaning to it.

Goodman tells his buddy Donny to ""shut the **** up"" every time he even tries to simply join the conversation, yet Goodman creates a monumental scene in the cafe about fighting in a war to protect the freedoms of expression and speech and how he won't be stifled. He lectures on ""proper nomenclature"" for asians, yet can't help but slip into improper nomenclature when his guard is down. He's a jew by marriage, practicing out of convenience, but goes to great lengths to let everyone know how devout his faith is - even if its fundamental tenets take a back seat to bowling.

Lebowski speaks with other characters employing dialogue that he picks up from others in completely different contexts (ala Bush's speech on agression early in the film while viewing TV). His interactions with nearly every character of authority paints him as the ultimate pacifist, a throwback hippy fighting the fascists, yet his whole life-altering debacle that is the substance of the film is born out of a conflict that he chooses to escalate - and does so with misguided direction in search of retribution.

On and on it goes - nuanced interactions that I've already decided must mean something more than what is spoken or what happens, so I had better pay attention if I want to make this effort worth anything at all.

Of course, buried in it all, the depth of stereotypes and embellishments bestowed upon Goodman's character in particular, I miss one crucial component of the character - the eternal search for meaning in everything. He's on the right track, but he's always off-the-mark. Meanwhile, Lebowski seeks to find almost no meaning in anything - he simply wants to exist - preferrably, happily so.

""Once in a while you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right.""

Lebowski is making no effort to understand his predicament, much less resolve it, while Goodman is in overdrive with theories that lead to more chaos. Ultimately, not only is the meaning of his predicament not what it seems, it is debatable if there is any meaning whatsoever. And when the credits rolled, following Sam Elliot's departing monologue, I had felt that I had in some ways been duped into playing the part of Jonh Goodman - one that we all play as mostly good natured studies in hypocrisy and illusions that seek to make ourselves understand things that aren't ""learnable"" per se - while the solution, the understanding, can be found in the dissimilarly flawed character of Lebowski - there isn't necessarily understanding through defined, sustained effort, simply moments of clarity in life that help you get through it.

Of course, I'm sure that nearly everyone that has watched this film takes away something completely different. When you throw down the gauntlet early and let the audience know that the plot is more or less a set-up to provide the characters room enough to promote subtle messages, you risk losing the war when the audience misses the point or objects to it. When there are either an incalculable number of points, or depending on the perspective, no point at all - and that's the point - well, you're at least trying to make my effort worthwhile.",1346889600,,5635,4.881799163179917

I actually can see myself growing more and more in to it as I watch it a few more times. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, the Dude. The Dude is a mellow unemployed bowler with a laid back attitude about everything, except his Persian rug. He also has really has a thing for White Russians and pajamas. His character was actually the first thing that pulled me into the story. Jeff Bridges doesn't play The Dude, he IS The Dude.

Jeff Bridges has a solid supporting cast as well. John Goodman in one of his five appearances in a Coen brother film, is actually hilarious as Walter. My favorite moments are the times that he tells Steve Buscemi's character ""Shut the f**k up, Donnie!"" I really enjoyed this movie all the way through, but it could have been better. One thing I had a problem with were the dream scenes where the Dude would either be flying over Los Angeles, running from Russians with scizzors, or some other psychedelic figure. This is just my own personal nitpicks. Fortunately, there are only a few of these dream sequences. Besides that, my only other complaint is that, as extreme the events of the film were, I never really felt excited. In the end, The Big Lebowski is funny enough, and the performances were great.

But for the casual fan, the person who doesn't already own a copy and just wants to watch this fabulous film, along with enough extras to make a casual fan happy- here ya go.

Now, I am writing this review assuming you have seen the film. If you have not, this film is almost impossible to describe. It's a slacker-comedy, with a mystery and some by-notes on the meaning of life. Satire is there, but nicely understated. You can watch this film on several levels, but I suggest just cracking a cold one and watching it for the fun of it.

993212,4,6304994540,"It's a rare movie for me that gets better with age, memory, and repeated viewings.  ""Lebowski"" is one of those movies.

I first saw the film when it came out in theaters in 1998 and, while I enjoyed it then, I wasn't especially enamored.  Perhaps it was because I was young and didn't much dig the drug references.  Or maybe it was because I kept trying to follow the plot more than I did the characters - which would have been a mistake.  While this film certainly has a plot - and an overly elaborate one, at that - the plot really isn't the point; it exists primarily to serve (and display) the oversize characters.

And, while it's taken me a little time to realize this point, realize it I did.  This film is really all about the idiosyncratic characters, the colorful dialogue, and the laid back vibe that Jeff Bridges (and, thus, the character of ""The Dude"") brings to the proceedings.  Those things hold the film together.

A mild warning to some, based on a few complaints that I've encountered while reading the reviews: the dialogue is colorful, by which I mean that it is both funny and frequently profane.  The `F Word' gets dropped quite a few times throughout this flick, and - due to a couple of the plot threads - there are clear and explicit references to the adult film industry as well as frequent references to drug culture.  You don't need to be acquainted with either of those areas (I'm certainly not) to enjoy the flick, but if ya' *really* don't dig that kind of stuff - as in you have strong %&#@ moral objections to the material, man - then this movie probably isn't your kind of thing.",1330646400,,1614,4.45578231292517

A bizarro world has been created, where a wealthy philanthropist named Lebowski is mirrored in a skewed hippie deadbeat version also named Lebowski (The Dude). The Dude exists in a Bizarro Los Angeles where bowling is popular and CCR is too. However, he's about to come face to face with the Big Lebowski! The Dude's world will collide with another world, where L.A. is filled with schemers and criminals who enjoy In-n-Out Burger. The Dude gets caught up in a blackmail/kidnapping plot and is forced to help extort the Big Lebowski on behalf of three German Techo dancers. It is indeed a bizarro L.A., as one can only imagine. The Dude does things very differently in bizarro L.A., like making a White Russian with half and half. The semantics in bizarro L.A. are also skewed: The Dude refers to bowling as golfing, and Nihilists as Nazis. But, in some twisted way, that makes sense in any version of Los Angeles. The Big Lebowski is a film about two dimensions colliding in an epic battle for Los Angeles. It's unbelievable that this isn't widely considered a Sci-Fi Classic.

But Just based on the 4.5 stars rating it seemed like a good movie to enjoy on the holidays. I found most of the characters to be annoying and not funny at all. Most of the conversations were stupid, boring and  filled with profanity. Now Don't get me wrong, I can stand a movie where characters drop the F word here and there but I can't really think of any conversation where the F word was not present multiple times. If you are one of those people who get really excited by hearing people curse at each other then this is the movie for you. If profanity = funny to you then watch this movie. I will admit there were some funny parts but most of the movie was garbage and the ending was really bad. I think this is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it in most cases, but in my case I will just say that I did not care for this movie. It's not a movie I will remember or even buy ( I tend to rent movies and then buy the ones I love), I don't think I hate this movie either. I would just classify it as one of those movies you watch once and then forget about it. I won't recommend you not to watch it as we are all different and we tend to like different movies.

Not only can I now watch this fantastic film in full 1080p widescreen, but the special features are excellent too.  I learned a lot about the making of the film from the entertaining documentaries.

The clips from the Lebowski Fest documentary sold me on the cult status of the movie.  And the gimmicky U-Control ""Mark It, Dude"" feature, that counts the F-bombs and ""dudes"" and whatnot is completely unnecessary but amusing nonetheless.

I also enjoy the book that's built into the case, which has some great trivia for fans, some interviews, and even the recipe for a ""Caucasian"".  And the digital copy of the movie is nice for those who need to get their ""Dude"" fix on the go.

993454,5,6304994540,"With the ""The Big Lebowski,"" the Coen brothers may not have created a comedic room. But the characters and situations they concoct are endless fascinating. Jeff Lebowski, a 40-somethng slacker who calls himself ""The Dude,"" has been confused with another Jeff Lebowski, who is a multi-millionaire with a high-spending wife. When thugs attack The Dude, thinking him to be the tycoon, an unlikely plot is set in motion in which The Dude is charged with coming up with the money the wife owes.

TBL never stops spinning the unexpected. The Dude loves to bowl, and his team consists of an former Vietnam vet (John Goodman) and a hapless hanger-on (Steven Buscemi). Between them, the trio hardly has enough brain cells to flush the john, but lurch along, trying to save the girl while making some money or themselves. One things that's funny about the film: The Dude - pot-bound, vacuous and benign - emerges as the biggest adult. Goodman thinks he is the leader, but his wacky schemes almost always flop. Another funny thing is the gang of misfits the Coens assemble to tell their tale - a naked expressionist artists (Julianne Moore), a gang of gothy German nihilists, a mysterious cowboy (Sam Elliott) and a team of competitive bowlers led by a jumpsuit-clad man named  Jesus. What the film lacks in outright hilarity and topicality, it wins by the sheer audacity and skill of shaping this gang of weirdos into a semi-coherent storyline.

993457,5,6304994540,"I'm sure everyone's impression/experience with this movie is different, but I'll be honest, the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, I struggled through it, and afterwards, formed the opinion that I didn't really care for it that much.  It had been built up so much in my mind as a ""classic"" and ""cult film"" that I had this idea that suddenly the cherubic choir would chime and I'd face the realization it was the best movie I'd ever seen, or at least top five.

It wasn't...but now it is.  How does this happen?  Every time I watch The Big Lebowski, it gets better.  Maybe I see another angle I didn't see before, maybe a detail that is new, perhaps even something that appears in a different context than each time previous, just because of where I am in life.  Whatever the reasons, it now has really become a film that I feel is damn-near flawless, and when coupled with a couple White Russians, makes you feel so good, it can sometimes become the best part of your day.  I suspect the Cohen brothers didn't even have the long-reaching scope in mind that this movie has when they made it...but like any good art, it morphs and becomes many different things to many different people.

As for the Bluray, it looks great, but sounds phenomenal, and its one of the first Blurays I've bought that I've appreciated the sound more than the picture resolution.  It fills up your flatscreen with an immersive experience that simmers you down and mellows you out, and like The Dude, allows you to, for a short time viewing just ""abide"".  I wish all movies did that.",1319932800,,1557,4.5088967971530245

993459,4,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski doesn't need a review, so if you're here to read about the film, this won't be helpful. This is a review of the Blu-ray Limited Edition with book.

That being said, this is a very nice edition. The photographs in the book are great and are fun to see behind the scenes action, especially Jeff Bridges' photos. He's a talented photographer utilizing his unique pano camera.

The Blu-ray conversion is clean, crisp and well done. The picture and sound are excellent. The digital copy is a nice plus, but consider that the coupon expires on 12/31/12. Its more than a year away, but its worth noting in case it's something you forget to take advantage of.

However, my biggest complaint is this. The size of the book (which holds the physical disc) is actually just a little larger than standard Blu-ray cases. While this may not be a big deal to most people, if you're like me and have bookshelves fit to the height of a Blu-Ray, this movie can't stand on end. It has to be laid flat, or sideways on the shelf. It's a little thing, but for those with extensive collections on shelves, it can be annoying.

993611,3,6304994540,"The Coen's live in their own universe and, luckily for us, it's a wacky one that they get to put on film and we get to visit. The Coen's do a wacky black comic variation on Raymond Chandler with their film ""The Big Lebowski"".

The ride that we take in Coenland this time around involves The Dude aka Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)an unemployed bowler who is mistaken for the wealthy Lebowski who's Lolita-like wife is kidnapped and held for ransom. The only problem is that The Dude finds himself involved in the exchange of the money for Mrs. Lebowski--except the money is stolen. Add in John Goodman as a slightly deranged gun toting convert to Judeaism who wants to keep the ransom money and Jesus (John Turturro)a fancy dressing bowler who likes to lick his ball before bowling for a soup of wacky characters. A terrific supporting cast includes Julianna Moore, Steve Buscemi among others only enhances this black comedy with their mixture of eccentric and deadpan performances.

I've read a couple of reviews of ""The Big Lebowski"" indicating that this is a nearly flawless transfer. I'd disagree. It looks decent but suffers from too much DNR smoothing over the skin textures to an unnatural degree--they don't look like wax figures but the film could look a bit better. There's also evidence of edge enhancement in several early scenes where The Dude meets Mr. Lobowski. This isn't much of an improvement over the DVD and evidently was pulled from the same source as the HD-DVD transfer from a couple of years back.

It's a very poor effort from Universal in terms of the transfer itself. If you're not picky about your Blu-ray image quality, you'll think this looks just fine for those who are you will be somewhat disappointed. There's good and bad about the transfer.

The 5.1 lossless mix sounds exceptionally good--it's a pity the film isn't presented with as much care.

The extras are really good--we get a really good making of featurette as well as a paen to ""The Dude"" housed in a hardcover Blu-ray holder with a booklet filled with photos. The U Control feature here allows trivia to pop up now and again and a counter that keeps track of all the profanity in the film (and there's a lot).

We also get Jeff Bridges' photo album, ""Flying Carpets and Bowling Pins"" a featurette on the dream sequence for the film and an interactive map.

While the extras are very good, the transfer of the film itself is disappointing.

Five stars for the movie, 2 stars for the transfer--shame on you Universal!",1314662400,,2504,4.740229885057471

Probably my favorite of them is the Mark It Dude feature, which tallies up all of the dudes, Lebowski-isms, and F-bombs throught the movie, (and there are quite a few F-bombs, but the use of most of them are pretty funny).

So we watched the DVD.  I gave it about twenty minutes--to be polite--though after about three of them I knew I hadn't the slightest idea in the world what the hell this--thing--was about.  Here's a bunch of guys who they seem to think are 'with it' I suppose.  The dialogue is essentially one raunchy joke followed by another cheesy joke, with a ""f"" bomb about every four seconds.

993690,2,6304994540,"The 2-star review has nothing to do with the quality of the movie... I thoroughly enjoy ""The Big Lebowski"", and have seen it many, many times.  The problem is the transfer: grainless, lifeless, and not at all film-like.  It doesn't represent the character of film in any way, looking quite like an early, heavily scrubbed hi-def video transfer.  It's at least better than the first-issue DVD I own, but anyone who has any of the DVD re-issues would be hard-pressed to find a great improvement in this version.

I saw the film in 35mm last year at our local art-house cinema, and it looked MUCH better than this release.  Yeah, it wasn't a particularly crisp film, and did show some age....but it did contain film grain, and it looked real.  Of course, if Universal actually released a high-quality transfer of ""Lebowski"", they'd have no reason to re-release every few years (and lose a nice revenue stream.

The Film 4/5

The Big Lebowski is essentially about mistaken identity if you care about the plot. Jeffrey Lebowski is known to his friends as The Dude (Bridges) and a gang of criminals pay him a visit thinking that he's another Lebowski who happens to be a millionaire. After they urinate on his rug, he seeks out the millionaire to claim compensation.

The millionaire's wife goes missing and the gang asks for a million dollars in ransom. The Dude is chosen as the courier.

That's about it. The plot is incidental; this is a movie about a way of life.

The Dude hangs out with two of his bowling buddies, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran who has anger management issues; Donny hardly says a word and is told to shut up every time he tries to make a comment.

The Dude is a mellow kind of a guy. He shops in his robe, gets high, and talks like he's permanently stoned. Walter is a mystery to him because he is so easily annoyed. When a competing team puts a toe over the line during a bowling game, Walter pulls out a gun and insists that it is marked down as a zero. It's a league game after all.

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and can be classed as a comedy more than anything, but the style of comedy may be different to the type you are used to. Many of the jokes are clever and subtle, and it's rare for the humor to be aimed too low.

Watching The Big Lebowski is an experience. You're never quite sure what it is or where it is going. The plot elements aren't very important, but everything adds up and provides a reason for the characters to do what they do. It's the sort of movie where nothing happens, but you find yourself thinking about it days later.

Fargo and No Country for Old Men are exceptional movies from the Coen Brothers, but many fans would argue that The Big Lebowski is better. I'm not among them, but it amuses me and I'm glad to finally own it on Blu-ray.

Video Quality 3.5/5
Although the Blu-ray is a vast upgrade over the DVD, I'm a little disappointed with the overall look. Colors are much improved and everything looks brighter and cleaner, but the VC-1 presentation could have been better. Fine detail is present in a few scenes, but is lacking for the most part. Faces in particular seem badly defined. It just about earns a passing grade, but don't expect to be dazzled.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track sounds great. The songs carry a lot more weight than in previous releases. Dialogue is clear throughout and the predominantly front-heavy mix blends well with the action. No complaints about the sound.

The Big Lebowski is a typically quirky effort from the Coen Brothers. While not their very best work, it deserves a place in your collection. Bridges and Goodman excel in their roles and hold the whole thing together. The Blu-ray presentation enhances the experience, but not quite as much as I had hoped. The packaging is good and there's plenty of behind the scenes information if The Big Lebowski is your kind of film.

993692,2,6304994540,"Universal took an old outdated HD transfer (same as released on HD-DVD) which had already issues and then applied generous doses of digital grain removal and some digital sharpening to it and fiddled with the colors and contrast till it ""popped"". And there is your remastered version that looks nothing like the original film it came from. Poor release, poor policy. To see how it's done properly check out the new Cohen Brothers Blu Rays for ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Miller's Crossing"". Why do these look much better, more detailed and like film with a texture of grain? Because they are new transfers made on modern equipment and unnecessary and destructive digital tinkering was abstained from.
Universal has probably the poorest record of all major studios when it comes to catalogue titles. And Lebowski is another victim of this cost cutting strategy (no new transfers, recycle and overprocess old ones instead).",1313193600,,916,5.113333333333333

This is one of the most deceptively clever, funny, deep and interesting movies ever.  It should not be surprising that it has a huge cult following of die hard Lebowskis.

I don't see a need to give a synopsis as the actions in the movie aren't what is important - they will probably seem disjointed and irrelevant the first time you watch it so try not to pay too much attention to them.

This is a fact that is strongly supported by a legion of hardcore dedicated fans world wide. The Big Lebowski is not a cult film - it is the cult film. It has a zen like leisure to it scarcely ever found before or after it came out. You don't have to be a real slacker you can just watch one on television. Aside from all the amazing sensationalism there is a also a great film here as well. The film is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novel, The Big Sleep.

This has happened more times than I can count. It's a masterpiece in my book and one of my top ten films.

993807,5,6304994540,"The biggest peice of advice I can give if you really want to enjoy this is to watch it more than once.  It's very easy to see it for the first time and decide you never want to see it again... a mistake I almost made.

It may be tough trying to settle on an opinion of this movie based simply on reviews, as it seems that they are seperated into two basic categories: the dedicated cult-fans, and the Coen Brother followers who just plain hated it and didn't find any humor at all.  It sounds strange, but they're both right in a way.

The Big Lebowski can easily fall into my top ten list, but not as a Coen Brothers film.  Don't misinterpret, as it is very much a Coen Brothers creation, but probably their most unique one.  When I first viewed the film in its entirety, I didn't like it at all.  I had been on a Coen Brothers kick and was busy collecting all of their films for viewing, and this happened to be one of the last of their films that I picked up.  Typically, I had been admiring their work specifically because of their excellent screenwriting.  Every one of their stories seems not only to be perfectly written and paced, but also a break from the traditional 3-act mold that virtually every other film follows, so it is understandable that either you like the Coens or you don't.  This movie is great for a very different reason, though.  The script is filled with their usual quirky unpredictability and ironic musings, but I wouldn't say that the script for Big Lebowski, in and of itself, is a particularly decent work.  In fact, the story is actually pretty pointless and stupid, which was most of what I picked up on during my first viewing.  But the movie is not good because of the script, and that, I think, is what makes The Big Lebowski so much different that it's kin.

This movie is a masterpiece because of the characters, and the performances of said characters.  It is also easily the most quotable film ever.  Jeff Bridges plays his quintessential role as The Dude, a character so well done he managed to spawn an actual religion titled ""Dudeism"".  The film is very much an overture to the religion because it offers a very laid back point of view on a greedy world obsessed with material possessions and money.  The Dude more or less casually walks in and out of situations involving thugs, millionaires, sex offenders, pornstars, fascists, and antisemites, all of whom are playing tug of war with a briefcase containing one million dollars (and another one full of dirty undies).  The Dude and his adventures are purely about atmosphere rather than story.  It's a fine example of how every part of a picture, even the seemingly pointless ones put in place only to progress from one part of a story to the next, can be taken advantage of.  The best example of this is probably the Gutterballs sequence, which serves no real purpose other than as a treat in between actual scenes, but it's easily the best scene the movie has to offer.

The film's soundtrack really helps develop the Dude's laid back atmosphere, including tracks by Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, and of course, some Creedence tapes.  And for those of you who are drinkers, this is one of the best drinking movies ever, whether you are sipping on an actual White Russian, or relaxing with a few burgers and some beers.  Like most Coen Brothers films, it is difficult to narrow this down to one specific genre.  Comedy seems to be where the movie stores keep it, but it is also a suspense mystery as well as a contemporary western.  For me, it's what I watch when I just want to relax and have a good time.",1297036800,,3600,4.491551459293395
993808,1,6304994540,"I love Coen Brothers movies. Every one I've seen is near the top of my list of all-time favorites. For years my friends said to see ""Lebowski"" and I finally did. I have rarely sat through such a boring, pointless, humorless piece of junk. (It's sad that all the obsessed fanboys who sit on here are going to immediately give me thumbs-down reviews because they have nothing better to do than sit on Amazon defending their precious cult favorite).

I'm not a child (32) and I have no problem at all with sex, drugs or cursing in movies. I like comedies...FUNNY ones. This movie does not have the slice-of-life hilarity of ""Fargo"" or of Javier Bardem's mushroom-haired killed in ""No Country"". This is Will Ferrel humor, especially the idiotic Jesus character...come on, haven't we had enough of ironically-""funny""-take-their-lives-too-seriously Ben Stiller/Steve Carrel characters?

993810,5,6304994540,"With what, almost 800 reviews of ""The Big Lebowski,"" who needs another one? Well, I watched ""The Big Lebowski"" for the first time since its original theatrical release last night, and wanted to write one whether it's needed or not.

Why do I say ""The Big Lebowski"" is ""awe-inspiring""? It is awe-inspiring because it has actually inspired a religion called ""Dudeism"" that claims to have ordained over 50,000 ministers via its web site. I studied comparative religion in high school and took theology in college. As religions go, Dudeism goes down well, like a nice White Russian. Also, ""The Big Lebowski"" has an awe-inspiringly dressed and coiffed character played by John Turturro called ""The Jesus."" This is pronounced ""gee-zus"" not ""hay-zeus."" It's been suggested that ""The Jesus"" have his own movie, but I don't think that's a good idea. A little of ""The Jesus"" goes a long way.

I have to say that on first viewing I was kind of lost.  I thought ""The Big Lebowski"" fell far below the incredibly high bar the Coen Brothers set in their previous release, ""Fargo,"" which I am still upset did not win the Best Picture Academy Award in 1996. ""The English Patient"" was beautiful, well-done, serious, ponderous, and a period piece . . . in short total Oscar bait . . . but who wants to watch ""The English Patient"" over and over again? There's no wood-chipper in ""The English Patient."" The subject of circumcision does not come up in ""The English Patient."" In fact, unless ""Juliette Binoche is really pretty"" counts, I can't think of a single memorable thing about ""The English Patient,"" and I didn't need to see ""The English Patient"" to know that Juliette Binoche is really pretty. If you saw ""Fargo,"" you've never forgotten it, and if you love it, you  love it a lot. But Oscar hates a comedy, no matter how brilliant, and anyway, I digress . . .

So, as I said, on first viewing, ""The Big Lebowski"" did not strike me as up to Coen Brothers' standards. Just a lot of swearing and little bits of weirdness and bad taste strung together in a plot that was beside the point. I walked out of the theater feeling disappointed and indifferent.

Well, all I can say is I'm older and wiser and a whole lot happier now, and ""The Big Lebowski"" is as perversely charming and funny a film as I can imagine. You can find details in other reviews about the amazing performances, large and small, the endlessly quotable dialogue, the lovingly drawn characters, and the wonderful pastiche of Raymond Chandler LA noir, Busby Berkeley dance sequence, and humor that satirizes almost everything from feminism to philanthropy to Gulf War I to bowling. There's even a little tribute to Charles Laughton's only film as a director, ""The Night of the Hunter."" The Best Picture nominees in 1998 were two Elizabethan costume dramas and three movies about World War II. I can't remember anything about them. ""The Big Lebowski"" was, of course, not nominated for anything. Sometimes justice prevails if you abide long enough.

A comedy classic from the American cinema's achievers. Check it out.

We saw the main show and i think we stayed for a bit of Lebowski.  I had never heard of the Coen brothers nor this film and it certainly was silly....However I ended up liking it in spite of myself.

Now, years later I watched it properly, from beginning to end...and I've seen a number of the Coens' other films and have due respect for them.  And I think I like this almost the best of all.  I loved Oh Brother, but that was mainly for the sound track.  What I like about this is it's so unpretentious and joyously dopey.  It's blessed with a terrific cast--they must have had a wonderful time making it, unhampered by the pressure of having to make a serious art film.  And the fun comes across.

It's not for everyone, for sure. One thing that did bother me was the excessive use of the f-word.  I'm no prude but really....If somehow that word were prohibited from film making the Coens would be out of business.  Still I'll take that over all the blood and gore of some of their other films.

993860,4,6304994540,"I don't know which edition is the best to buy.  I don't think the Dude would much care what format you put him into or if a bowling ball came with the DVD or not.  In the end the Dude just takes each day as it comes, seemingly content to having survived another odd experience.

The movie pretty much starts and stops and occasionally comes to a crashing halt just like the Dude's car.  It is a pastiche of noir and kitsch elements loosely held together by the Dude having to deliver a ransom for a rich man's young girlfriend, Bunny, and soon finds his life completely turned upside down by events.  The Coen Bros. humorously capture the laconic LA scene, forcing the Dude to have to face some rough rides and tough broads (Julianne Moore), before finally getting a clue to what is actually going on.  Walter is there to help him out, played with the bravado you have come to expect in John Goodman, but usually ends up making an even bigger mess of things.  Buscemi comes across as odd man odd out in this strange bowling trio.

If you are used to the tight, plot-driven movies of the Coen Bros. you may be disappointed by this one, as it is played entirely for comic effect.  There really isn't much there to hang the Stanger's ten gallon hat on.  It is what it is.  Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1294099200,,1311,4.310204081632653

993867,5,6304994540,"First, an aside. I don't know why so many reviewer say there is no plot. There is a pretty obvious plot, a very convoluted one, having to do with the payoff for a kidnapping. There are also more than a few sub-plots. What IS true, is, as an earlier reviewer said, the plot is just a McGuffin -- it doesn't really matter what it is, just so long as it brings together the various characters so we can enjoy their interactions. (Maybe that's why it had to be so convoluted.)

But the one thing of importance I wanted to add is that the movie is glorious to look at. The cinematography is brilliant as is are conceptions behind it. As a small example, pay attention to the fades between scenes at the bowling ally near the end. And more obvious are the Dude's dreams, or hallucinations. Many reviewers concentrate on the left-brain humor, but the right-brain is also rewarded.",1286755200,,873,4.490566037735849

Jeff Bridges (""the Dude"") and John Goodman are particularly brilliant in their roles of bowling buddies setting out to unsnarl a kidnapping fiasco. Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in ""The Big Lebowski"" than I have in a long time during a movie.

There are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the ""punch line"" in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh!

993909,4,6304994540,"`The Big Lebowski' is one of those films that started off small and over the years has gathered a cult like status. With Lebowski fests and often repeated phrases from the film, this has certainly entered the film goers psyche.

After `The Dude's' rug gets urinated on after a case of mistaken identity he very rapidly gets drawn into a convoluted kidnapping mystery, when all he really wants is to get a replacement rug, drink White Russians and get back to his bowling league. Not too much to ask you would think. Yet he finds himself fending off threats from all sides and tries valiantly to keep his car from being totally wrecked in the process.

Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude and plays the part spot on. His long hair, slightly vacant look and stoner drawl fit the role to a tee. John Goodman is also good as The Dudes angry Vietnam vet friend Walter and the rest of the cast turn out great performances as well. The direction is very good and the more weird dreamy scenes are especially fun to watch.

All in all this is a low key film that has risen to the top of the barrel over the years and it will keep you interested and will raise a laugh or two as you go along. There is a certain appeal to The Dude's laid back lifestyle and his charm really makes this film. Sit back and enjoy this minor cult classic.

This is surely not the best movie ever made by the Coens, but it is such great fun.
What did the Dude say after 5 dips of his head in the toilet bowl, asked where the money was? Let me have another look, it must be in there somewhere. Or something like that.
What did he say when the gangster shows him the bowling ball and asks: what is this? No, he does not say: can't you see it is a golf ball. He says what I put in the headline.

What made me watch it again today? First of all, watching Bridges as Bad Blake yesterday reminded me that I wanted to revisit Lebowski since some time. Second, I had a discussion in a comment thread around here about the fact that comedies age. Some that I remembered as hilarious from decades ago, like Polanski's vampire joke, or like Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, have on revisit turned out to have become stale.

Jeff Bridges (the ""Dude"" Lebowski), John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Julianne Moore are the stars and unforgetable as they go on a journey of mistaken identity, White Russians, kidnapping, bowling championships, and the Los Angeles underworld.

993938,5,6304994540,"On the heels of their 1996 masterpiece of sly humor ""Fargo"", Joel and Ethan Coen made ""The Big Lebowski"". It lacked the intensity of the sharpest Coen brothers films and failed at the box office only to become a cult classic, basis of its very own subculture, and one of the Coens' most analyzed films. The world of ""The Big Lebowski"" is familiar territory: the Coen brothers like to play with the idea of a fundamentally disordered universe, the world of film noir with a darkly humorous edge. The humor in ""The Big Lebowski"" isn't as dark as usual, though, owing to the fact that its protagonist is a laid-back, aged hippie whose feathers don't ruffle easily, dropped into a Chandleresque mystery that boggles him about enough to annoy even a stoner peacenik.

Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski by two thugs who break into his apartment, rough him up, and pee on his rug. As this is obviously unjust, the Dude decides to seek compensation from the other Mr. Lebowski, the rich old man whose young trophy wife apparently owes someone money. Mr. Lebowski (David Huddleton) is reluctant to pay up, but when his young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) disappears and there is a ransom demand, he thinks the Dude is just the man to deliver the money. Being a basically agreeable fellow, the Dude agrees but inadvertently involves his bowling partner, a highly strung Vietnam vet named Walter (John Goodman), who is more a liability than a help. Meanwhile, the Dude's new rug is stolen.

Even the pauses in the Dude's speech were scripted, but this is still one of the most memorable performances of Jeff Bridge's long and impressive career. The Dude is hilarious and endearing and wise without wanting to be. He wants to drink his White Russians and bowl. This is film noir without a noir protagonist. Instead of imploding in a fit of existential angst, the Dude reacts to the confusion and injustice by trying to go with the flow -or trying to ignore the issue. The world doesn't let him; it turns him into a reluctant detective. ""The Big Lebowski"" is replete with staples of film noir, from identity confusion to rapid dialogue. But the Dude offers a unique reaction to the dilemmas of a world that doesn't make sense. It's hilarious and, at the same time, an interesting perspective.

The DVD (Universal 2008 10th Anniversary edition): The 10th Anniversary edition offers two featurettes, a comedic introduction to the film (4  min), Production Notes (text), and a theatrical trailer (2  min). ""The Dude's Life"" (10 min) interviews the cast about their characters and what made the Dude so popular. In ""The Dude Abides: The Big Lebowski Ten Years Later"" (10 min), the cast talks about the evolving perception of the film and about the dialogue.

Joel and Ethan have been making fantastic movies for a while now, but The Big Lebowski will always be their most popular. It's one of those films you immediately think of when the words ""cult classic"" come up. With so many memorable characters and a story you won't soon forget (if you can follow it), The Big Lebowski deserves most, if not all, the underground hype it has gotten over the last decade or so.

A bizarre case of mistaken identity sends our slacker hero The Dude on a mission to replace his soiled rug. He and his bowling buddies Walter and Donny subsequently get mixed up in a high stakes kidnapping-for-ransom plot with another, wealthier and more successful Lebowski in early 1990's Los Angeles.

It's hard for me to not give this movie a higher score. There are so many hilarious and quotable moments that you can watch it over and over and never get bored. Performances by Bridges and Goodman are classic, and the characters themselves take on a life of their own by the end of the film. However, there are too many times where the story either lags too much or surges forward without giving you time to comprehend the new information. There are a few too many plot twists for me to take it seriosly as a crime/detective story.

It's a decent merger of black comedy and neo-film noir, but many times I found myself laughing through important plot information. I finally got the story down cold on the third time through. On some level this is a compliment, and a testament to how funny it is, but it's an odd experience to laugh your way through a movie, then be unable to describe what it was about five minutes later.

The Dude isn't quite an anti-hero, or a reluctant hero, or really a hero at all, and I really liked the way he just got drawn into such a weird plot simply because of his name. What really made the movie interesting, though, was how well it played with all the elements of the private detective genre without really having a private detective. Think of Jack Nicholson in Chinatown, but make him a stoner and a bowler who likes white Russians, and you'll get The Big Lebowski.

Also, it's the minor characters who make this movie really shine. Walter is brilliantly written and acted, and the bit characters like Donny and the actual Big Lebowski never stop being funny. I especially liked the Big Lebowski's executive assistant, who reminded me of Mr. Smithers from The Simpsons. It's no wonder this thing has become a cult classic.",1248393600,,858,4.682119205298013

Still, every time I see him in a movie my estimation of his ability rises notch by notch.  And in this inspired farce he's simply, complicatedly wonderful.  It's a buddy flick, and he plays against John Goodman, that inspired farceur who earned his stripes and paid his dues playing the tender side of the mad, manic, monomoniacal virago ROSEANNE, in the TV Sitcom of the same name.  A decade in that well-paid hell gave him nuts enough to do anything, and here he shines as a psychotic Viet Nam vet.  (Satiric portrait of Ms. Barr?)  But then, the entire cast is so brilliant they make your teeth itch.  Can't name them all.

But without going any further I have to tell you that there are several intense sections in this flick that have some of the best effects of good Jazz, and by good Jazz I mean the best jazz.  Particularly, here, Count Basie's music.  Basie's approach was to float a secure, framework of familiar song in blues mode, and to let the band's soloists work their specialities in the time alotted, when their turns came up.  Simple, but with Basie, the soloists were so fantastically good, and so (mutually) energized by being free to improvise and encouraged to do their 'thing,' they rocked the house and each other to hights beyond nightclub high.  And its much the same here.  The ""Mistaken Identity Whodunnit Flight From Armed and Merciless Crazies"" is a standard in movies, since Silents, and though brilliantly revived here by Les Cohens, the seance comes to life when the soloists get their cue.  Bridges & Goodman play as close as nested spoons, riffing and grooving with such great timing and virtuosity they're like Jimmie Noone and Joe Poston at the Apex Club.  Weep for joy!  You can go back again and again to try to see how they do it.

Is this the best edition of the film available on DVD?  Don't know.  Can't comment.  Mine features the Cohens themselves, in an interview about how the film came to be, and to my mind its worth extra bucks to watch those two sitting, side by side, twisting their fingers, tearing at their cuticles, wringing their hands, scratching their heads and rubbing their eyes -- not quite in unison; its not quite a choreography of Ritilin-fueled siamese hyper-activity -- and talking in manic but repressed monotone about the creation of one of the best movies since the end of WW II.

The plot?  Read another review.  Its a take-off on or homage to Chandler and Hammitt's novels, stories and screenplays, set in the chromium glitz and glare of East Hollywood's neon-spangled hamburgeries and bowling alleys.  Amazingly, in all its dizzying detail and with its huge cast of extras and bit-players, everything fits.  The attention these geniuses pay to every detail of the production is awe-inspiring in total, but to try to describe the film adequately would require a piece of writing that demanded more time to read than the movie requires to watch.  Not worth it.

My particular favorite bit?  The recital of the Dude's Landlord.  The Landlord himself (a short, balding, pudgy, middle-aged schlepp) is so tiny a part -- of only two or possibly three short lines -- that it's obviously a throw-away character.  And then, somehow, and without explanation, The Dude and  his crew find themselves members of a tiny audience in a makeshift theatre, watching a one-man performance of some kind; a dance and pantomime performance to brilliant modern symphonic music, as highh-minded, intense and serious as it is ridiculous in its ineptitude.  And then, long after the scene is over I came to realize that a crucial part of the Dude's rental agreement is or must be, that he he appear with his friends at the Landlord's Performance Art events.  Throwaway.  High Art in L.A.  And eventually, in this Mardi Gras parade of geeks, freaks and wanabees, the Dude impregnates a chic, international dyque-as-femenist and certifiably crazed Performance Artist -- though we never get to see her in action in one of her own works -- we see her in a Buzby Berkley Bowling Ball Ballet dream sequence of the Dude's.  Don't ask.  Its like those great insights they told you you were supposed to get when you first took LSD or Mescaline.  Such insights didn't exist, but the rationale within the fantasy of easy enlightenment was just so damned interesting.

994054,5,6304994540,"I won't go deeply into the plot of this film. It is just to convoluted, too bizzare, and in a sense, beside the point. Let's just say that a smart but burnt out old hippie tries to find a kidnapped girl, has a fight with nialists, has a toe sent to him, has his rug pissed on, has another fight with the same nialists plus one marmet, is duped into conceiving a baby...............are you starting to understand why I don't want to do a plot summery?

But yet, you just gotta see this film. The writing and acting-Jeff Bridges, John Goodman-is pure surealism, full of events that are nearly impossible to happen in the sequence they do, and are always absurd, yet the movie makes all of it totally beleiveable and extreamly funny. You completely accept and are drawn into the world of these guys, because they are just that nuts, and just that likeable.

994136,4,6304994540,"I confess to being an extremely late-comer to join the Lebowski fan bandwagon. I didn't see it when originally released in the theatres, and hadn't EVER since until just last year, when a good buddy of mine gave my a copy for an Xmas present (you KNOW you have a good friend when they feel comfortable giving a married father of 6 something like this). Having watched it a couple of times since, I thought I'd add just one small perspective about this very special, but eccentric flick, that particularly caught my attention after viewing it again (while my wife and kids weren't home, of course) last night.

This being the 706th review posted to this site, I shall forgoe the usual format of film critique, and comment only on the issue of profanity in movies, as The Big Lebowski, I think, provides an excellent example of why some folks get so worked up over profanity in movies, and usually for all the wrong reasons.

Needless to say, Dude, profanity more than abides in The Big Lebowski. Sometime maybe I'll even try to count the number of times it's used in this flick, but my rough guess is about every 4th word in the movie is profane, with about 75% of that the notorious F-Word.

Here's my bottom line: it didn't bother me in this movie, not at all....but you have to reflect on the reasons why, and compare it to other films where it does bother you, to fully appreciate what all the fuss is about.

Profanity in movies that bothers me falls into a few general categories:
1- Profanity that is out-of-date for the time period being represented. Never ceases to peeve me to hear Medieval knights blithely using the F-Word, including even the hyphenated variations of that theme. This usually stands out as an all-too-obvious attempt (and a weak one at that) by the moviemakers to try to make period movies ""more accessible"" to a modern audience. It does the opposite for me, and not just because of the profanity itself, but because it represents such a lack of imagination on the writer/directors part. It's just BAD film-making.
2- Profanity that adds nothing to the emotion of the scene, or is spoken by a character in the movie for which it is inappropriate and not believable. Numerous examples of how even the bluest profanity just fits, as in scenes of extreme violence/rage, particularly modern warfare scenes (ie: Platoon), where the words add to the violent emotions the characters are feeling. And the opposite is singularly noticeable, too- when the profanity is completely inappropriate for the scene.....an actor spewing F-Bombs while in a Viet Nam firefight is natural, even necessary.....the same from an actor enjoying a cup of tea in a quiet bookstore is not.
3- Repetitive profanity: this one is more of a fine-line, and I'm sure some would argue that The Big Lebowski is one good example of repetitive profanity, and consider it onerous for that. But I'm not so sure- there's a fine art to the spacing of dialogue containing profanity in a film: if it consistently fits the character, the scene, and the emotions trying to be expressed, then it may not be repetitive, no matter how frequent. Lebowski struck me as being just that way: frequent, but not necessarily repetitive, in a distracting sense. I'm sure this might generate some amount of argument (for those who give a sh....t, anyway), but ""Hoffa"" was one memorable film for me where I thought that the profanity was repetitive and excessive, and detracted from the movie (even though it WAS appropriate to the characters being portrayed). There are countless other examples, but I'll just leave it at that for now.

ANYWAY: pondering this over in my mind last night, after watching Lebowski again, it occurred to me that somewhere up There, George Carlin is smiling. After all, perhaps more than any other entertainer, Carlin made us take stock of just what it IS about profanity that gets us so worked-up, and how silly most of that fuss is, after all. They're just words, Dude, and they were created by all of us regular dudes, too. For crying out loud: I was even renowned in my High School days for being the Dude (even though we didn't recognize the title back then) who could string together the most colorful, profane words in one run-on sentence, without even needing to pause to take a breath.....and now, 36 years later, I am a church-going father of 6, physician, and only prone to use profanity under extreme duress. The point is, it didn't ruin my life: I turned out OK.

So I don't know if this helps anyone decide whether to watch The Big Lebowski for the first time or not (if any such human actually exists), but just be aware that it is chock-full of the most blue language, AND you'll still likely laugh your ass off.

994219,5,6304994540,"In ""Big Lebowski"" (1998) -a weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique dry and more often than not dark humor, sit back, laugh out loud, and have fun. Big Lebowski is IMO one of the top funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interaction, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story of course which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus, etc but the story is truly secondary to the beautiful craziness of the movie. I've read many reviews that call Big Lebowski a mess, saying that the story is convoluted, call it misfire and deranged, with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' ""Fargo"" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski. I agree that ""Fargo"" is Coens' masterwork but it does not make BL any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. How wrong the prediction was. ""The Dude"" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast -ex hippie and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, more Jewish than Tevye Viet Nam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, ""sweet prince"" Donnie (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, even more than just the characters for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby boomers. Our younger son came home for Christmas holidays couple of weeks ago, and we were talking about and quoting BL, one of his all time favorite movies in our conversations - we always do. He gave me the DVD couple of years ago for my birthday, and the movie has become one of my favorite comedies since that time, too. Ironically, I did not like it much after the first viewing ten years ago. It seemed too surreal, loud, and strange. Now it is different - I can't get enough of it. While our son was visiting, Big Lebowski was shown on TV in the beautiful crisp HD presentation. Once again, I laughed so much and so hard that I was afraid to ruin my rug which really ties the room together in the same manner Dude's was. Great and immortal fun, THE cult picture for as long as people watch movies.

While writing about Big Lebowski, I looked up the Coens' resume. They've made only 13 films, and all of them are treasures, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime (2006). I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, ""Burn after reading"" - Brother Coen don't make bad movies, they don't know how. Their films should not be missed - they all are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures, in short, first class entertainment. There are only two working directors whose movies I always see upon release in the theater, preferably, during the first weekend - Woody Allen and the writing/directing team, Ethan and Joel Coen.",1231286400,,3333,4.847368421052631

994351,4,6304994540,"When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn't shout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City', 'Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic.

1 - intricate plot that everyone does best just ignoring.

1 - hippie protagonist.  Someone wholly incompetent at life, but left to simmer in this intricate plot for days.

1 - misguided 'friend' with the pent up aggression to spice up the protagonist, forcing him to pursue things he probably shouldn't

1 Dozen - eclectic mix of truly diverse characters, all true to form

Mix it all together in the City of Angels, and watch the fish out of water protagonist flop around in a series of incidents that are clearly over his head, enjoy the absurd interaction of diverse characters, and the brilliant dialogue that ties it all together.

WARNING:  Be careful not to partake in the plot.  This is poisonous, and any attempt to make sense of it will make you hate this film like poorly sliced Japanese Fugu fish.

.....................

This is one of the few movies I have watched multiple times.  It's funny, witty and endearing.......a rare gem.

994415,5,6304994540,"`The Big Lebowski' has been hailed as one of the greatest cult classic films of our time, and I just might have to agree.  The Coen brothers rarely disappoint (honestly, `Intolerable Cruelty' was a mess but aside from that they usually strike gold) and `The Big Lebowski', while not their smartest film, may be one of their most entertaining.  In all honesty, `Fargo' is a better film, but nothing in `Fargo' can match the brilliance that is Jeff Bridges as the iconic `Dude'.

So, `The Big Lebowski' centers around two men with the same name.  There is Jeffrey `The Dude' Lebowsky; a pot-smoking, White Russian drinking, unemployed slacker, and then there is Jeffrey `The Big' Lebowski, a handicapped multi-millionaire with a trophy wife named Bunny who has gotten herself in debt with some very dangerous men.  Those men, attempting to get their money, come after `The Dude', mistaking him for Bunny's husband.  Thus starts the tumble that is the Dude's involvement in a kidnapping scheme that pits him against some very strange (and albeit hilarious) people.  Teamed with his bowling buddies Walter and Donny, not to mention Lebowski's (the `Big' man) estranged daughter Maude, the Dude attempts to make some quick cash by playing as the go between for Lebowski and his wife's kidnappers.

The plot is simple and doesn't work too hard to embellish itself, but the brilliant script work and the flawless acting help make for some of the funniest moments and most memorable dialog in recent memory.  John Goodman really works well with the Coen brothers.  His performance in `Barton Fink' is seriously one of my favorite supporting performances of all time, and here in `The Big Lebowski' he dominates as the Dude's best buddy Walter.  Buscemi (who is also a perennial Coen star) doesn't have as much to do as he did in `Fargo' but he makes the most of it.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is hilarious as Brandt; his facial expressions in the limo with the two Lebowski's is one of my favorite scenes in the film.  Tara Reid plays a variation of herself as Bunny, and Peter Storemare is hilarious as the Nihilist member of the techno pop band `Autobahn'.  The character of `The Big' Lebowski is a tad clichd, but David Huddleston is hilarious enough to make up for that.  Julianne Moore is fantastic, and I mean that, as Maude.  I seriously am starting to change my opinion of this actress.  She has been lauded over and over and seriously up until this past week I didn't understand why, but her performance here (and more notable in `Short Cuts') is starting to change my mind.  Everything about her character play here is hilariously on point.

But nothing compares to `The Dude'...nothing.  Jeff Bridges is in all honesty one of my favorite actors; he may even break top ten for me.  He just always sells it, even when he's not mind-blowing he has that consistency about his work to where it is always solid.  His performance here is not only solid, but it is mind-blowing.  Comedic-wise he just devours this film, becoming this character from this inside out.  He beautifully builds layers of apathy within a character that is deeper than his roots, but most importantly he understands the dialog and `how' his character would sell that dialog, and he soars.

`The Big Lebowski' can be labeled another Coen triumph, to rest on the shelf along with `Fargo' and the more recent `No Country for Old Men' as iconic cinematic experiences that one shall not soon forget.",1217894400,,3462,4.8074324324324325

I also watched a Youtube Poop (comedic videos of cartoon shows with overdubs and other material on youtube) where the ""Is this your homework Larry?"" scene's audio was overdubbed on a few scenes of ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" which depicted an angry Dr. Robotnik and Grounder the Robot interogating Sonic about his homework and the stolen car and money.

I recommend that everyone watch this movie at least once, because it would be a shame to miss out on this funny and well-done masterpiece.

994494,5,6304994540,"""Why does everything have to be a travesty with you, Walter?"" -- The Dude.

I'm not going to write the usual things that you read in reviews about this film because there are a lot of reviews here that are incredibly repetitive and another one wouldn't serve anybody. Also, I live in Los Angeles, do work and have worked in the film business in different capacities over the years and I have very different things to say about this film ... so readers be warned.

I saw this movie when it was released at the Hollywood Galaxy with a few friends and I'll be honest, the scope and impact of it didn't hit me right away. After I saw it, I didn't say ""Sweet Jesus ... that's a masterpiece!"" It was only when I saw it a few more times in the next handful of years did it dawn on me how good this film actually is.

First, I want to tell you that the bowling alley where this was filmed, no longer exists. The Los Angeles Unified School District annexed the land, tore down the structure and erected a high school in its place. I used to bowl there regularly when it was still kicking though and I even have a memory of seeing the ""We're going to be closed due to filming"" sign that was slapped across the glass door just before they shot it. I also have a memory of the sign that said ""We're closing our doors for good"" sign when they put that up, too. Sadly, a lot of the fixtures, the exterior lights and different pieces of memorabilia were vultured and used as interior d&eacute;cor at the uber-silly Lucky Strike lanes located in the mega center of Hollywood and Highland. `Lucky Strike' is a place where no self-respecting bowler would step foot into, it's a place where they cheerfully play `The Eagles' on the jukebox and bourgeois fascists run amuck. It's a place full of fake tan wannabe trust-funders reciting `Killers' lyrics in a drunken haze as if it were poetry. I mourned the day the Hollywood Star Lanes closed and wept the day Lucky Strike opened with its stolen d&eacute;cor. If Walter Sobchak had anything to say, he'd do something about it.

""If you will it, dude ... it is no dream."" -- Walter.

The next place is Johnnie's over on Wilshire and La Brea. Johnnie's was fully functional during the time that they shot there, just like Hollywood Lanes, but now it's a full-time film location and only opens for crews when they're shooting something. Some may sigh and feel bummed that they missed the opportunity to eat at the counter like Walter, all I can say is don't worry about it. I ate there several times and it was pretty bad. The waitresses were original d&eacute;cor too, the food was almost inedible and the coffee smelled like turpentine. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. If anyone tells you different about Johnnie's, don't bite - it's a sham. It's just one of those things that looked better on film than it ever was in real life. It's no mistake the Tom Waits never bothered to mention the place in song.

""The Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!"" -- Walter.

Next, I've been on a few film sets through years, and every time I hear the Director or the Producer utter the title of this film, I immediately freeze to hear what's coming next. One set in particular, the Director squealed out during an argument with a production person: ""It's going to be just like The Big Lebowski!"" I cringed when I heard that, as did several other people. Trying not to laugh was also painful. Nothing could be like The Big Lebowski. If anything could, we'd be surrounded by close facsimiles and we're not, which is why this film is such a classic now, from the first frame to the last. People will struggle to emulate this film in every way and probably all will fail. Even now, I've heard rumor that there is a screenplay and plans for another installment of The Dude and his troubles. The word `sequel' is not being used and thusly avoided. It's anybody's guess as to what's going to happen and when. You can hate me for mentioning this and say I'm full of it, but it is what it is, man. You know? Certain things have come to light, man.

Lebowski Fest ... is what happens when people fall in love with something and go to extremes for the sake of carrying out a dream, so to speak. It's a worthy event and a lot of fun. I've been twice so far, when it was organized in Los Angeles and I had a blast. Jeff Bridges played on stage the first time and David Huddleston (The Big Lebowski himself) screamed `The Bums Will Always Lose' through the overhead PA at the Cal Bowl lanes in Lakewood, holding fast to a White Russian. Good times are sure to be had, and if you get a chance to go to Lebowski Fest, do so as it's one of the few great events that you can go to that you'll laugh from the first moment to the last minute. Lebowski fest is gearing up for their 7th Annual Fest in Kentucky where it all began.

The disc could use more special features, it's been said. It would be good to hear more commentary and to see more footage and interviews, but maybe they'll put all that together for a 10th Anniversary edition this year, who knows. Anything's possible, man. If you will it ...

The Big Lebowski is an amazing film that seems to be one of these flukes of filming like Casablanca. While people worked hard to make it happen, no one knew that it would become what is has while they were hard at it. I'm incredibly grateful to the Coen Brothers for this as it is solid entertainment through and through and shouldn't be missed. If you didn't get the first time, just catch it again, later.

994496,5,6304994540,"To get an idea of how convoluted this plot is, imagine channeling the spirit of Raymond Chandler, giving him a pound of dope to smoke and feeding him nothing but postmodern ideas for a few years.
The result? The Big Sleep on steroids; and just like The Big Sleep, following the plot is irrelevant. The movie is carried by loquacious, deliciously irreverent dialogue, and eclectic characters.

Though based in Los Angeles, this film's aesthetic feel is not that of a big city. Compare its general tone, coloration and cinematography to Michael Mann's films, which DO filter the feeling of a big, sprawled urban environment.

The Big Lewbowski hides its surroundings in the twisted minds of its characters.

Since the plot is largely a ploy for dialogue, it is hard to summarize this film.

All that needs to be known is that it is about a group of die hard, lazy bowlers, one of whom, The Dude, gets mistaken for a millionaire. After Jeff Lewbowski (aka the Dude) is mistaken for another Jeff Lewbowski (the rich one), some criminals break into his house and pee on his rug. From that point on absurdity reigns.

I suggest not even trying to make sense of the labryntine plotline, nor the heliogabiline twists and turns. The best thing to do when watching this movie is listen to the witty dialogue and pay attention to each character's quirks and idiosyncracies.

Walter (a bowler and vietnam  vet.) is undoubtedly the funniest character, representing as he does, old school nationalism and pseudo-masculine values. The Dude is a lazy sponge. He is the ultimate anti-hero. He spends most of his time (mis)regurgitating dialogue. His blazen attempts to plagiarize out of context make for some maliciously ironic scenes.
If you expect to get any large 'grand' meaning from this flick, you will not. There is nothing to get.
Just enjoy the humour, philosophy, and irreverance. If there is a moral, it is that life is found in the cracks, fissures, and crevices. The big picture often obscures this. Oh yea, and heroes are passe. This is the age of the everyman hero. What better everyman (anti)hero than the Dude?

994498,5,6304994540,"""MARK IT ZERO"", screams a gun toting Walter to his bowling opponent, who Walter claims stepped over the line by mere centimeters. Begrudgingly, the ""zero"" is marked down and Walter, very calmly & innocently, puts his gun away and says, ""It's a league game"", with a complete belief and justification for his over the top action.

This is the theme of the very funny film, ""The Big Lebowski"". It's an over the top film where bad guys pee on rugs, innocent people get faces shoved in toilets, women have their pinky toe (with green nail polish) cut off, where a pederast named Jesus tries to win a bowling title, Sam Elliot is the narrator, and Donny is always told to ""shut the f*ck up"".

The Coen Brothers are to thank for this huge cult hit. Their star, the dude, is quite possibly the laziest man in the world and is desperately trying to be reimbursed for his pee soaked rug. He is then thrown into a world of 2nd rate porn, fake kidnappings, nihilist, dinky biting marmots, Walter's constant Vietnam War rants, and an eccentric painter wanting his baby. It's no wonder the dude's diet mostly consists of white Russians and marijuana.

All the characters are memorable and gel excellently with one another, despite their major flaws and idiosyncrasies. Props to John Goodman and Jeff Bridges for their portrayals of Walter and the Dude. They made a great match together with their constant bickering and flinging of F bombs. Also to John Tuturro for being on screen less than five minutes, yet capturing one of the most funny and memorable character in a long while.

I was expecting more from the DVD, such as behind the scenes, or a directors/actors commentary. None of that was included. Hopefully one day, but in the meantime it's a pleasure to sit back and watch this funny film over and over.

994555,5,6304994540,"For anyone familiar with the whacky ways of Coen brothers (""Raising Arizona,"" ""Barton Fink,"" ""Fargo""), The Big Lebowski represents the sibling filmmaking duo at their whacky best! They do here what they have done in all their best films: take a familiar genre (the gangster genre in ""Miller's Crossing,"" for instance) and insert their own odd-ball comic spin, always with an eye for the irony and absurdity of the genre. This film is essentially a spin off of the noir/detective film where the hero gets caught up in a complex web of seedy characters and situations -- usually involving money, the femme fatale, and a murder or two. Of course, when it's the Coen brothers, it can never be as serious as all that. In this case, the noir detective -- as it were -- is in fact not the suave, Bogart type at all. He is the Dude; a lazy, overweight, pothead who is content just spending his days at the bowling lane. A plot is put in motion, however, when two toughs, mistaking the Dude for a millionare named Jeff Lebowski (which is of course the Dude's name), come looking for money owed by the Big Lebowski's -- the millionare's -- reckless young wife. This leads the Dude on a quest to replace a rug that was, well, soiled; a rug that really tied the room together. When the millionare's wife is kidnapped, the Dude is caught up in the noir plot involving a ransom and some suspicious Russian nihilists.

If this all seems a little silly, than the film is a success. And this is only straching the surface of the lunacy; for in this web of characters we have a crazed Vietnam vet, a Latino transvestite who likes to fondle little boys, a feminist artist who likes to swing nude -- except for paint -- onto a large canvas, an adult video mogul, a wandering cowboy, a ninth grader who may or may not have stolen a million dollars, a severed toe, a camera inside a bowling ball, and -- oh yeah -- a brief cameo by Sadam Hussein (not played by himself). All of these ingredients, mixed a healthy dose of vodka and Kahlua (the Dude's favorite drink), makes for a nonstop riot fest. And, in case that weren't enough, there is a fantasy sequence involving nude women on trampolines, magic carpets, vikings dancing with bowling balls, a guy with an enormous pair of scissors, and endless pairs of ugly bowling shoes. The film is great fun, even for non-bowlers, non-pot smokers, and non-White Russian drinkers; the classic quotes are endless. Here are just a few:

""Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.""
""Were you listening to the Dude's story, Donnie?""
""Shut the f--k up, Donnie."" (Repeated on numerous occasions)
""I'm not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude; so that's what you call me. That or Duder, His Dudeness, El Duderino.""
""Who's got your underwear, Walter?""
""Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.""
""F--k it, dude. Let's go bowling.""
""You want a toe? I can get you a toe. There are ways, Dude. You don't even want to know.""
""You see what happens, Larry? You see what happens? Do you see what happens, Larry, when you f--k a stranger in the a--?""
""You're being very undude.""
""Well I guess we can close the file on that one!""

And so on.... The funniest moment, for me, is when the Chief of Police of Malibu wings a coffee mug at the Dude's head. I just lose it every time I see that.

Now as to the HD-DVD version itself. It is no better than the basic DVD version and simply not worth buying if you already have the regular DVD version. The HD-DVD format is simply a disappointment.

""The Dude"" never had much use for his given name, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And for a man who lives to drink White Russians and bowl with his friends, who needs a big old name like that?  His real name is the source of much of his trouble in The Big Lebowski, however, as he is mistaken for a millionaire with the same name whose wife ""owns money all over town"".  Played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, long hair and oversized pajama bottoms and Bermuda shorts that look like he stole from a homeless man, the pot-smoking Dude passes through life with the constant abandonment of a lazy summer day...until goons seeking the other Lebowski assault him and urinate on the rug that ""really tied the room together, man.""

The resulting action is a charming, meandering follow-up to The Coen Brothers' critically acclaimed Fargo.  Although the two have a few cast members in common and the Coens' trademark of finding art in shots of day-to-day life (a great montage of bowlers plays with the opening credits), the films have little in common.  Where Fargo was an unrelenting drama, full of suspense and mystery, The Big Lebowski is more of a good time.  Yeah, there's a plot in there about how Lebowski's search for retribution for his soiled rug thrusts him into a kidnapping caper with pornographers and nihilists, but the film is more about The Dude, the man for his time and place.",1191974400,,1518,4.617100371747212

Well if you like their unique take of life and colorful characters then you also like this one.  This has a lot of the same actors that are in most Coen Bros stuff and all of them are played to utter perfection.  There is not a miscue to be found in these performances.  The biggest problem this film had when it was realized is it was the Coen's follow up film to their Oscar winning Fargo.  Many people who loved that movie were not Coen fans, went and saw this one, and didn't have the same appreciation for what this movie was suppose to be.  This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see and is only equaled by other Coen movies. It's unlike Fargo is this is a niche film that will only be liked by a select few that ""get"" what it's about.

""The Dude"" played by Jeff Bridges is an aging old California hippie that just wants to bowl and smoke pot but finds himself caught up in a complex kidnapping plot of Someone's wife that shares his last name.  John Goodman plays the ""dudes"" best friend and is one of the funniest characters in the film.  This is one to watch over and over.  Like many smart comedies the jokes in this film are muti-layered and found only funny after a second or third viewing.  Sometime it goes right over your head.

The Dude is such a great character you can't help but love him.  Don't we all wish we could walk though life as clueless as the Dude...I know at times I wish I could.  At first viewing I didn't get a lot of it's ""jokes"".  I've seen this film about 10 times and feel like it's a truly remarkable character study due to the writing and brilliant acting. I can't watch it without having to stop it because I'm just laughing my ass off at the subtle brilliance displayed by these characters. The Dude abides.",1188000000,,1919,4.274238227146815
994658,4,6304994540,"This is nothing but a remake, or maybe the original (I would know if I had checked the dates: but you know, laziness, and it is funny to remain fuzzy, like the Coen Brothers themselves) of what we know under the title of ""Pulp Fiction"". The Coen Brothers get rid of the shuffling time line and have episodes and chapters in order, but it is just as intricate as the other, except that it is harmless, more or less, and funny in the punk beatnik post 1968 style if you like that and the unemployed who play the Greek philosophers.. It means that the mistake in ""Pulp Fiction"" becomes the rule here and everything is over-reacting and mis-targeting the true victim of the explosion, of temper of course, never of any fire-arms, though quite a few are moving and travelling around, just like bowling pins and bowling balls. That's a way of looking at  suburban social sprawl that deserves some attention and time. The best debunking of pulp fiction is in the bar-diner scene. A lot of noise and ruckus for very little. I like the breaking in, out and through of all sorts of cars. The Coen Brothers don't seem to like cars probably because they are the best representation of American wastefulness and extreme vain arrogance. But ""Pulp Fiction"" seems to debunk cars too though in a different way.

Walter is obsessed with Vietnam, to the point where he introduces Vietnam into any conversation regardless of whats being talked about.

994795,4,6304994540,"Usually, I find modern comedies quite horrible and mostly unfunny.  But The Big Lebowski I find to be infinitely amusing.

Jeff Bridge's character is a subtle characterization of a bum who likes to drink White Russians and bowl, and I always find myself wondering what exactly is his source of income?  Can't help it, but force myself to suspend my disbelief.  Bridge's character is fundamentally interesting and it's fun just to watch him being 'Dude'.  In fact, this is a guy I would love to hang out with.  His assessment of the Eagles music alone made me want to buy this DVD!

Actually, you have to suspend a lot of your disbelief since this whole story is a ridiculous farce from the get go.  And that's quite OK.

One thing I like about it is that it doesn't seem to have been written as merely one 'gag' after another but smoothly flows from one ridiculous scenario to another that are all brilliantly tied in to the main story line...if there is indeed anything that can actually be called a story.

John Goodman was surprisingly hilarious.  I can't say enough about his character and how he handled it.  Truly one of the finest bits of comedic acting I have ever seen.

I found it interesting that the writers included a rather deep, touching human element concerning the friendship of Lebowski and his two friends without being trite or sickening.

The 'making of' portion was mildly interesting and featured mostly the Coen Brothers discussing the film.

Personally, the mere fact that I spent my hard earned money in buying a copy of a movie that is shown quite a bit on TV should convey how strongly I recommend those who like offbeat comedies.

994861,5,6304994540,"I first saw the Big Lebowski when it came out in the cinema back in 98. At the time, my only experience with the Coens was the Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo. I could never work out why everyone loves Fargo so much - it's a well-made, fairly entertaining film to be sure, but apart from the one time I saw it in the cinema I've never felt compelled to watch it again. The Big Lebowski, however, is a film that I'm happy to watch over and over.

For me, the reasons for this are many and varied. Firstly, the film makes me laugh my head off. Sure, the central character is a stoner so instantly people will paint this as a stoner film but there's so much more to it than that. The dialogue and the way it's used is so much fun. Take, for instance, the many offhand comments that a uttered by one character and then picked up and used later on by other characters, like Maude's 'in the parlance of our times', which the Dude pulls out later on in a conversation with the Big Lebowksi. Or, the whole 'johnson' joke running through the film. Also, the hilariously convoluted conversations between the Dude, Walter, and the perpetually slow-witted Donny.

Secondly, after watching the movie a couple of times I really started to appreciate the classic film noir aspect of the plot. Ok, so the mystery isn't really that important, but it does at least make sense and rewatching it again does reveal clues here and there that tie into the mystery. And without the meandering plot, we'd never be introduced to so many entertaining characters.

Which brings me to the third reason I love the film: the characters. I haven't seen that many films where every character, whether they're important to the plot or just minor roles, is just so much fun to watch. There are the main characters of course, like Jeff Bridges' definitive portrayal of uber-slacker 'el duderino', John Goodman's classic turn as vietnam-obsessed Walter, Julianne Moore's oddly sexy artist(e), Donny, the character Steve Buscemi plays, who has more trouble following the course of a conversation than the pot smoking Dude, and of course the rich and ridiculously pompous Big Lebowski. However, even tiny roles are far more entertaining than they have any right to be, eg. Phillip Syemour Hoffman's smarmy offsider, the two cops who interview the Dude about his missing car, Jackie Treehorn the porn mogul (amusingly, the classiest character in the film), the Dude's weedy ballet dancing landlord, even the cop who shows the Dude to his recovered car ('they probably just used it as a toilet and moved on'). Even the car itself is entertaining, progressively becoming the victim of greater and greater misfortune until it finally bites the dust right near the end of the film.

Humour is a personal thing, so I can understand that not everyone will get into this film. However, if you can appreciate that sometimes plot can be  secondary to character and dialogue and still produce an entertaining film, then you should almost certainly get something out of this film.",1169164800,,3023,4.75047619047619

With every viewing I have picked up stuff that I had not noticed in previous viewings man, like everytime you watch it you will too.  The movie will definitly grow on you man, so grab a white russian man, and just go and pop in the movie man, and pretty soon you will be calling your self ""THE DUDE"" you will be saying ""SHUT THE F**K DONNIE"" etc.  One of the true Stoner movies glad I saw the movie, I highly recommend it man.",1168041600,,962,4.020942408376963

I agree totally with everything written here stemming from a positive vibe, man.  This is one of my favorite movies.  Certainly my favorite Coen Brothers movie in their comedic body of work, even bypassing ""Raisng Arizona"" (which I think is a masterpiece as well).

What I think I might be able to add is a paraphrase from Kevin Spacey when he was being interviewed by Leo LaPorte on a now defunct show called ""The Screen Savers"" on a now equally dead network called TechTV.

Spacey is a personal friend of Jeff Bridges who plays ""The Dude"" in ""The Big Lebowski"", and as the two of them (Spacey and LaPorte) were discussing the topic of hi-tech cameras, and the special photographs that Jeff Bridges was taking, the subject of the character of ""The Dude"" came up.  Kevin Spacey told Leo that if he wanted to know what Jeff Bridges was like, all he had to do was watch ""The Big Lebowski"", because Jeff was essentially ""The Dude"".  I really wish YouTube had it in stock. It was far out, to use the parlance of our times.

Suddenly Lebowski's life is changed when he is mistaken for another Lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters.

The plot evolves as many other Coen movies (Raising Arizona comes to mind) as we are introduced to more-and-more colorful characters and the plot gets more-and-more outrageous, yet somehow still seems real.

My favorite component of this film is the character played by John Goodman, a Polish Viet-nam veteran who converted to Judaism after marrying his ex-wife. He has a hair-brained plan to help Lebowski extricate himself from the mix-up mess and he doesn't bowl on Shabbos. He also baby-sits his ex-wife's Pomeranian when she goes out of town.

Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude, a stoner livin in L.A. who enjoys bowling and being lazy. One night, a group of thugs mistake him for a millionaire with his name, and pee on his rug and demand money. Jeff decides to settle things by visiting the elder millionaire who posseses the same name as him. The wealthy Lebowski refusese to compensate for the rug, angering The Dude. However, when Lebowski's wife Bunny (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, he enlists The Dude's help. The Dude is ordered to make a ransom drop, to which he reluctantly accepts. Things go well until The Dude's friend Walter Sobchack (a riotous John Goodman) decides to tag along, managing to complicate manners. The Dude is then plunged into a world of intrigue, encountering hialrious situations, killer nihilists and the perfect match for him, the esoteric artist Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore).

This film is a true classic. The special edition dvd comes with a making-of documentary, a photo gallery and few other extras. This isn't a film for everyone, but those who enjoy this type of art-house humor and filmmaking will no doubt be impressed.",1155340800,,1345,4.818181818181818

The Dude becomes involved in a kidnapping rescue mission, meeting ponographer's, a police chief, a child molester, a feminist artist and a teenage runaway on his quest to replce his beloved rug. It really tied the room together, you see.

994953,5,6304994540,"""The Big Lebowski"" might actually be the funniest film of all time but only if you like its style of humor (parody and subtle off-kilter satire). Even then if you are anything like me you will find it only mildly funny during your first viewing. As others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it, probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot (while not as complex as ""Miller's Crossing"" it still challenges viewers to pay close attention).

The DVD does not have a commentary but it does have a short feature full of interviews, where the Coen Brothers explain some of their rationale for certain elements in the script and reveal places where the cast put their own individual marks on the film.

""The Big Lebowski"" features the Coen's trademark comic style. They are students of films and their secret is taking a traditional character and creating an incongruity between the way you expect the character to talk and behave (as per movie conventions) and what actually happens.

For ""The Big Lebowski"" the Coen's play with the detective, buddy picture, and the suspense genres. They set up a Philip Marlowe episodic detective story, but as their main character they substitute an aging pot-smoking bowler (Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski played by Jeff Bridges) for the film noir detective.

Like Marlowe, the Dude gets caught up in scheme a whole lot bigger than he is and gets episodically pushed and pulled by a lot of strange characters. His buddy Walter Sobchek (John Goodman) is a blustering Viet Nam veteran who manages to further complicate almost every situation. Much of the humor comes from the way the supposedly laid back Dude continually comes unglued over Walter's behavior.

Finally the Coens incorporate not one but two Hitchcock MacGuffins into the film. The series of unfortunate events are set in motion by a rug (the floor covering type) and midway into the film it is replaced as a motivating factor by a young woman (Tara Reid). Ultimately neither is of any importance yet they are the reason for everything that happens in the film.

New Lebowski fans can be found drinking White Russians, entering their local bowling alley for the first time in years, looking up ""nihilist"" in the dictionary, and checking to see if TVLand is showing any ""Branded"" reruns. If any of that sounds like fun you should definitely check out the film.

994954,5,6304994540,"""The Dude, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or, uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."" Those are The Dude's immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other Jeffery Lebowski. You're probably thinking ""What is he talking about, who is the other Jeffery Lebowski?"", well I'll tell you in just a moment, I've just got some things to clear up first. Joel and Ethan Coen have made some of the most loved films of all time, and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making duos/team of all time. These fellows bought you the cult favourite Blood Simple, the hillarious Raising Arizona, the decietful Millers Crossing, the crazy Barton Fink, The Hudsuckers Proxy, and the blood drenched Fargo, and now this, one of the finest films they've done, The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges is Jeffery Lebowski or in this case, The Dude. John Goodman plays the Vietnam veteran Walter, Steve Buscemi is not in it too often, but he plays the loveable Donnie. Let's just go through the character sketches(only The Dude's bowling pals).

Characters:
The Big Lebowski's main character is The Dude, he lives in LA, he listens to Creedance Clearwater Revival, his favourite drink is a white russian, and he loves bowling. The film is set in, as we've established before, Los Angeles. The Dude is an average joe slacker who dresses in, as what you could say, 'the hippie who likes to surf clothing'. Sandals, shorts, crummy old shirts, jersey jackets(jackets that are jerseys),he never wears socks with his shoes(even in bowling shoes) and occasionly, glasses. Let's  also not forget his long hair that makes The Dude's image so legandary. The Dude's bowling buddies are Walter Sobchak, and Donny. Walter is a Vitnam veteran and refers everything to nam'. He mostly wears shorts, a shirt with a sleeveless jacket, hiking shoes, socks(obviously), and always, and I mean ALWAYS wears his aviator sun glasses. He also has sort of an army man buzz cut with a beard around his mouth. Donny, is a great bowler, whenever we see him bowl, he gets a strike, except for once later on(don't want to spoil anything). That's all we bassicly know about him except that he usually(when bowling) wears long pants, a bowling shirt tucked in and a haircut where is hair isn't too long or too short. He's a nice guy and is usually told to shut up by Walter because of his late involvement in conversations with The Dude and Walter.

The plot:
The movie kicks off with a man narrating. He has a Texan accent and talks about a man named Jeffery Lebowski who also goes by the name 'The Dude', and is the supposed storyteller of The Dude's story, but doesn't narrate until later on. As he narrates we see The Dude in a grocery store in his sandals and the previous statements I made of the clothes he wears, he's looking at milk and tests one of them to see if it's sour, he later arrives home with his purchased milk but is surprised by two thugs, they dunk his head in the toilet and are telling him to give them the money that Bunny owes them. They later realise that it's not the Jeffery Lebowski they're after, they've soiled The Dude's rug and they eventually leave, but The Dude wants to get to the man who they were supposed to get, this is the other Jeffery Lebowski I was talking about and is the millionaire Lebowski, he's bassicly the title's name ""The Big Lebowski"". The Dude pitches up at the millionaire's mansion and attempts to get a free carpet in exchange for what the thugs were supposed to do to The Big Lebowski's carpet. He eventually get's what he wants but is then later called by Jeffery Lebowski to drop off money to kidnappers who kidnapped his trophy wife Bunny. To cut this short, the film is about The Dude trying to get Bunny back to Jeffery Lebowski, and how he has to deal with other problems that Jeffery Lebowski has, because people come looking after him because of the same name he shares with the millionaire Lebowski. The drop off of the kidnapping leads to all of his other problems. Walter is told about the ransom money by The Dude and decides that The Dude and himself should keep the money instead, because Walter thinks that Bunny kidnapped herself. Walter gives the kidnappers a bag full of dirty laundry that he had, so they keep the money in the car when they go bowling, as they come out, his car is gone. So they have to get the money back without Jeffery Lebowski knowing.

The film is hilarious, but that doesn't mean that it's just a normal movie, it's stunnig. The dialogue is sharp and witty, although there's alot of swearing, that doesn't mean the humour is just fowl mouthed, it's hillarious, some of the lines go down in history as some of the funniest one liners ever. The Coen's writing here is as good as ever, with excelently written and thought out characters. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are absolutely hilarious, they're definately the funniest characters in this movie(Jesus is also funny), and make you wish the film would never end. The other things that are worth watching the film for are the acid trip sequences and the absolutely incredible vintage rock soundtrack.

This is a comedy lover's dream come true. If you love the Coens and excellent snappy humour then this is a must have for you. even you don't know the Coens too well or even comedy, then here's a film too start with. Just buy this now, or soon, or whenever you have a split second of a chance to buy it.

I can't tell you what the special features are on this disc, because I have the region 2 edition. This one most probably has the same trailer my one has.

995009,4,6304994540,"Fargo is close to perfect; multiple viewings only make it better.  Perhaps the Coen brothers decided that for their next effort they would just have fun.  Who knows?  But where Fargo is disciplined, structured, and perfectly timed, with well-drawn characters that live on the screen - The Big Lebowski seems lost from the opening credits, swerving around in a fog of passive stupidity, acted upon rather than acting.

This, is course, is due to the nature of its protagonist, The Dude, played with convincing sloth by Jeff Bridges.  (Rumor has it that Bridges prepared for the part by smoking pot incessantly, drinking heavily, and going for days without changing his clothes - what a pro!)  To burn an entire sentence describing the action would be to squander perfectly good English words - this movie celebrates its pointlessness gleefully.  However, what it lacks in traditional film staples like motivation, characters worth caring about, development, and meaningful conflict, it returns in the form of quirkiness - and nobody does quirkiness quite like the Coen brothers.

John Goodman is insufferable as Walter, the deranged vet.  Every second he's on screen, somewhere, somebody races to the bathroom.  As Donny, Steve Buscemi is hilarious - no one since Chaplin has made so much out of so little dialogue.  John Turturro is amazing as Jesus, the diabolical bowling maniac clad in purple.  Tara Reid's Bunny is compelling and visually pleasing, while the great Julianne Moore provides the movie with one of its most memorable scenes.  Naked except for a leather harness, and suspended high in the air above a massive canvas, she soars through space, hanging on a wire, frantically hurling paint as she goes.  Such a scene would make even an awful movie wonderful, and The Big Lebowski, while flawed, is not awful.

The other truly sensational scene is the bowling dream, a Busby Berkeley-like hallucination The Dude has after being knocked unconscious.  This too is marvelous enough to redeem the picture.  No discussion of The Big Lebowski would be complete with a mention of the three Nihilists - painfully thin men dressed in black who hunt The Dude with their weapon of choice - ferrets.  Nobody will be seated during the horrifying throw-the-ferrets-into-the-bathtub scene!

In short, there's enough fun here to make the trip worthwhile.  TBL is not a great movie, at times it's like the idea of a movie that's too lazy to get out of bed, but the Coen brothers are just so good, and so good at being funny, that the trip is always worthwhile - even if there's no destination.",1148601600,,2588,4.974418604651163

995018,5,6304994540,"""The Big Lebowski"" is just perfect.  Everything about this movie is a laugh riot, even the bits of dialogue that aren't punchlines.  The cast is perfect, the writing is perfect... this movie has both Julianne Moore and Flea in it, what other movies can you say that about?  Well, there was the Gus Van Sant ""Psycho"" remake, but that doesn't count.  I found this movie by accident and I haven't let go of it since.  I may not be a stoner but I will say I've found more happiness since I embraced my inner Dude.

Every time I go back to ""Lebowski"" I come away with something new that wasn't there before.  Like the realization, this time around, that Jeff Bridges is not seen to throw a single bowling ball in the entire movie.  And that Steve Buscemi's character rolls a strike every time we see him... except for the very final scene, for reasons that become clear a few moments later.

The rest of the cast is just superb.  Remember Philip Seymour Hoffman as an unctuous PR man?  I'd forgotten about that.  Jon Polito (late of ""Homicide"") shows up as a P.I. in a familiar-looking purple VW bug.  Even Aimee Mann is in one scene, speaking German.  Oh, and Tara Reid, before her career completely and utterly collapsed.  Top supporting honors go to Sam Elliott, who according to the DVD documentary wasn't even sure what he was doing in the movie, but his opening narration gets funnier every time out (""And in English, too!"").

Another great thing is the dialogue.  You'd think the whole movie was done by improv, the way the dialogue is so natural.  Every character has their own particular jargon, and just like in real life, people keep repeating phrases they've heard elsewhere.  Jeff Bridges can't seem to finish a sentence, and neither can Steve Buscemi, although that's because John Goodman won't let him.  George Bush gets quoted a lot (""This aggression will not stand, man"").

Finally, I love the totally unglamorous portrayal of L.A. and Hollywood, limited to tiny theaters, a seedy bowling alley, a weapons store in the barrio, and the In 'n Out Burger (on Camrose).  The actor and artist type characters who show up are all obnoxious or pathetic, particularly David Thewlis's ""video artist"", and the chubby dancer/landlord who forgoes collecting rent from the Dude so long as the Dude shows up for his performances.  Not to mention Karl Hungus and the great Ben Gazarra cameo.

But in the end, Jeff Bridges is the glue holding this movie together... and John Goodman... and John Turturro... and... and... aah!  Lost my train of thought here.  But... ah, [...], I've done introduced 'em enough.",1140912000,,2605,4.733333333333333

As it's extremely probable that whomever is reading this has most likely seen the film, rather then a recitation of the plot (or lack there of) and characters it would be beneficial to understand what Lebowski means to you. How has it changed you? How has it changed the way you look at film.

The fact that this film was overlooked by critics upon release underscores the complexity of this pointillist masterpiece. Surreal, dense and howlingly funny are three terms you might never hear in a sentence save for describing Lebowski. This is less a traditional narrative than a puzzle that only reveals itself after multiple viewings. In a sense it gets better every time you see it. In deconstructing it you learn that every frame has purpose, every frame has a motive. In stepping back from it the allegories of the culture wars are clear. I've seen it nearly 100 times. Last week I recognized the artwork in Maude's studio and the impression it makes on the Dude's subconscious for the first time. Whenever you think your an expert at something you realize there's someone smarter than you and that was certainly the case when I attended Leboskifest last summer in Louisville. I'm not certain the Coens themselves could win that trivia contest. Those are certainly my people. See you this May in Austin!!!

The cast they assembled is impressive.  Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, John Turturo, Steve Buscemi,Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Ben Gazzara, Sam Elliot along with Peter Stomare make this film one of the most memorable films I've seen.

One of the most memorable characters (if not the most) is ""The Jesus"" portrayed to the hilt by John Turturo.  Even after having seen the movie at least 20 times I still laugh every time he comes on screen. Honestly, Turturo desreved an Oscar nomination for this role (if not the award).  He is that good!

The plot is convoluted, but not very hard to follow.  The Dude is a laid back pot head who lives for bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Buscemi).  The Dude is mistaken for a ""rich guy"" also named Jeff Lebowski.  He is attacked and his rug is urinated on.  Before long the Dude is investigating a disappearance, being attacked by nihilists and porn kings, and it goes on from there. The ending is classic and worth the cost of the DVD itself.

Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.

The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.

This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.

At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.

There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.

The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognizable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.

It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s. And the definitive man of that time was the Dude. The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously.

995085,3,6304994540,"I dunno why I'm bothering to write this review, as I don't have too much too say and I'm just gonna annoy people, but I feel the impulse.  Anyway, it seems like 'The Big Lebowski' is the most popular Coen brothers film for people in my age bracket, but I can't entirely get into it.  It's got some funny parts, and the main characters are all charming enough and all, but it just seems like it's trying too hard much of the time.  For example, the major dream sequence towards the end: Lame.  Doesn't work, trying too hard.  Furthermore, the film as a whole just generally goes nowhere.  Considering these characters that's pretty much all that could happen, but it just really starts to drag after a while with no focus.  I guess my problem is I don't like the Coens as much when they're doing pure comedy. (And I'd probably have to pick 'Blood Simple' as their best movie, which is, of course, their most purely dramatic movie.  By the way, don't make the mistake of ignoring that film, as it seems like more than a few Coen fans have.  It's amazing.)  Frankly, I think their sorta inexplicable, oddball comedy works best when it's juxtaposed with the violence and darkness.  Though that's not all that's at the heart of 'The Big Lebowski's relative weakness, as I like both 'Raising Arizona' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy' better than it as well and they're both really light hearted.  Still, though I don't think it requires any repeat viewings, 'The Big Lebowski' is definitely worth one look, anyway.  Even when they're pretty of the Coens can make something quite a bit different and more interesting than what you'll usually get at the movies.

995086,5,6304994540,"To me, the greatest thing about the Coen brothers is how vastly different each of their films is.  For example, after making the dark, dramatic ""Fargo"", they made this film - ""The Big Lebowski"", a comedy about a stoner who gets his rug stolen.  What other filmmakers would make such a leap from film to film, and continuing doing so through all of their films?  Only the Coen brothers.

""The Big Lebowski"" stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed man known to everyone as ""The Dude"".  His life revolves around the nights spent bowling with his buddies Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goodman), the latter of which is an easily upset Vietnam vet.  Life is good for The Dude - until two thugs beat him up and pee on his rug, mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski.  The Dude goes to visit ""the Big Lebowski"" (David Huddleston) and tells him about it.  Shortly thereafter, The Dude is beat up by three people he's never met, then ordered by the Big Lebowski to be the courier in an exchange - the Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (a young Tara Reid) has just been kidnapped.  From there on, things get worse and worse for The Dude.  How he's gonna get himself out of it is anyone's guess.

""The Big Lebowski"" is really a fantastic film.  There is a well-written, clever, and funny script - which isn't really a surprise from the Coen brothers.  Great directing and cinematography (the latter by Roger Deakins), particularly during some wonderfully quirky dream sequences.  There's also a really cool soundtrack, featuring Bob Dylan, CCR, and more.

But what would the film be without the cast?  Jeff Bridges is really great and funny as The Dude.  The real highlight of the cast is probably John Goodman, who is absolutely hilarious as The Dude's over-the-top best friend.  There's also good performances from Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, and Sam Elliott.  Coen brothers favorites Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and Peter Stormmare also appear.

As I've said, the thing that is most appealing about the Coen brothers are the differences between each of their films.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of their very best.  It's a stoner movie - and it's one of the best movies ever made.  Watch it, dude.  You won't regret it.",1137369600,,2264,4.775773195876289
995087,5,6304994540,"JEFF BRIDGES AS ""THE DUDE"" IS ALWAYS ON

IN A NUTSHELL: REFRESHING THOUGH UNORTHODOX WAY TO SPIN A GOOD YARN - BUT THERE'S LOT'S MORE:

""The Big Lebowski"" was a delight to watch. After the first five minutes, everything began to make perfect sense. The ""Dude"" turned out to be a very unlikely hero in what was a very unexpected string of vignettes that altogether made a delightful film experience.

Jeff Bridges as The Dude is always 'ON' in a very disarming way. His integrity of character through all the bizarre twists and turns of this story is what holds the film together and makes this unlikely yarn somehow quite believable.

OF COURSE ""THE DUDE'S"" GOT FRIENDS:

John Goodman as ""Walter Sobchak"" is quite a handful and is responsible for the plot thickening the third time, or is that the fourth? Goodman portrays the misunderstood Vietnam Vet who needs The Dude to be his co-dependent, but has found in The Dude someone even more dysfunctional than himself. Walter has a problem insofar as understanding that violence is not always cool. He seems to like guns with a leaning toward automatic weapons. RESULT = OOPS!

In the mess that ensues, we have pretend kidnappings or are they real? We have a trophy wife for an old disabled man in a wheelchair. We have bowling -- very serious bowling. We have angry people roughly demanding money from The Dude and urinating on his carpet, setting the whole fable in motion.

SOMEHOW ALL THESE GRAND VIGNETTES MAKE A REALLY COOL MOVIE:

Add to this Nihilists, a police chief, actors, weird art, strange people, The ""Stranger"" and bizarre motivations and you get one heck of a movie. We even have detectives following The Dude and somehow in awe of just how incredible he is! Through all this and a series of little skits that altogether make a movie, The Dude tries to hold it all together, to get a replacement rug, and to do the right thing. Somehow The Dude gets it right in the end.

To sum up, this film works on many levels and is a very refreshing though unorthodox way to spin a good yarn. Check it out and see if you agree!

995182,5,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski is a work of comic genius; it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Jeff Bridges is hilarious as ""the Dude,"" a pretty simple guy whose life goes all kinds of topsy-turvy after he's mistaken for someone else with the same name - Jeffrey Lebowski.  John Goodman is hilarious as his best friend Walter Sobchak, a boisterous Vietnam vet with a quick temper and a pathological need to jump in and take decisive action all the time, and Steve Buscemi is his usual entertaining self as the only reasonably sane person in the entire film.  The Big Lebowski is really all about dialogue and delivery.  The script is just wickedly funny from start to finish, but it is Bridges' laid-back delivery that really makes the comic engine go, with all kinds of help from John Goodman.

The Dude comes home one night, only to find himself thrown face-down in the toilet and otherwise accosted by two chaps demanding money to pay off his wife's debts.  He finally manages to convince the guys that he is not the Jeffrey Lebowski they are looking for - but not before one of the jokers gives his rug a golden shower.  The Dude is not at all happy about this, as ""that rug really tied the room together.""  After consulting with his bowling partners (the Dude spends a lot of time bowling), he decides to find the other, obviously rich Lebowski and ask him to reimburse him for the rug.  Soon thereafter, the Big Lebowski calls him in and asks him to serve as the courier for a money drop to some guys who kidnapped his pretty young wife Bunny (Tara Reid).  That's when all the trouble really starts.  The Dude's soon mixed up with all sorts of crazy people (including a gang of nihilists), while Walter manages to get him deeper and deeper into a lot of trouble he never wanted in the first place.  There are indeed lots of strands in the Dude's head as the whole story takes a series of odd twists and turns, each of them funnier than the last.  And he's got to get ready for the big semifinals of bowling league play, to boot - Walter is very, very dedicated to the bowling league games.  It's almost impossible to give a good overview of the plot, and I wouldn't want to do so anyway, as you really have to experience it all for yourself.

You've got to love the Dude.  He's just a lazy slacker who wanted his good, clean rug back, and then all this crazy stuff happened to him.  Rest easy, though, knowing that ""the Dude abides.""  Sometimes, that's about all you can do in this crazy world.  I should mention that the film more than earns its R rating for profanity, as about every third word anyone says is a curse word - so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may be ""out of your element"" here.  I am quite confident, though, that most viewers will laugh themselves silly watching this movie and will want to keep on watching it over and over again.

And that rug really tied the room together. He is lazy, walks around in his underwear smoking pot and spends most of his time bowling.

His friends are Steve Buscemi (who contrary to Fargo has to shut up all the time now) and John Goodman. He plays a psycho, Vietnam vet who converted to judaism. He thinks he knows everything and tries to helps The Dude to get his rug back.

It's definitely up there with Fargo and O Brother Where Aret Thou, other Coen movies. The situations are funny and weird and the acting is so good. The choise of 'real' actors instead of comedians surely helps in that.

The Big Lebowski came out in the late 90's and was not gawked upon with the robust blandishment of sanctity that it required in order to relegate its status from pop-culture obscurity to cult classic... or as Mortimor Young would say, ""It was originally produced by obscure Polygram films and slipped beneath the waves critically and commercially on its first release, floated hither and yon in the corporate paroxysms that shook filmdom during the catastrophic period of synergy.""

The Grand Lebowski can be seen as an ode to slipping between the cracks.  Every character in the film seems to function beneath societies' norm (even the paralytic Lebowski).

This film has, very deservingly, achieved a kind of cult status that very few films get.  While there are plenty of cult films out there, many of them appeal to a certain group of people, but, as my roommate said, no one dislikes this film.

In what is probably on a short list of comedy films with a (somewhat plausible) detective plot, Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a man content to just drift through life getting stoned, drinking white russians, and bowling.  That is until two thugs come to his house demanding money that he owes.  The beat him and urinate on his rug, which ""really tied the room together"".  Upon realization that he isn't the millionaire Jeff Lebowski that they're looking for they leave the Dude's house.  Egged on by his friend and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), who is a psychotic Vietnam vet, the Dude goes to the house of the other Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston) to ask him to recompensate him for his rug.  When the Big Lebowski tells him to beat it, the Dude encounters Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), the Big Lebowski's young trophy wife.

A few days later, the Dude is contacted by the Big Lebowski, and learns that Bunny has been kidnapped, and they believe that the same thugs who ruined the Dude's rug took her.  In exchange for being the courrier, the Big Lebowski promises to give the Dude $20,000.  What unfolds from there is one of the most insane detective stories I've ever seen, involving the Big Lebowski's artistic daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), a nihilistic porn star (Peter Stormare), and Hugh Hefner-esque porn king Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara).  Also, there is a bowling subplot, which involves Walter and the Dude's teammate Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Jesus Quintana (John Turturro).

It's weird, there are so many things about this movie that might turn people off to it, yet I don't know anyone who's has seen it and disliked it.  It is extremely funny, a little edgy, and it has a very well-done plot.  All of the actors are very good in their roles, though Goodman and Buscemi deserve a little extra praise for their chemistry, seeing as how Buscemi's Donny only serves to be the whipping boy to Goodman's Walter.

There is a reason why most things in life that have a cult following - have cult followings: And I don't even have to investigate into whether this movie has one - as I know it has to. And I know this despite the fact that I only know one person, besides myself, that appreciates it at all!

Personally, I do wish that you could buy this movie with a mute over the ""cuss"" words, as I would like to show it to all my friends and family (a circle of people that couldn't take a quarter the amount of swearing). And ""yes"", I know, I can feel you all cringing over such a thought, because I know, the cussing is part of what makes these characters so funny. Not because cussing is funny in it self; but because these guys are so dysfunctional that they don't even notice that it is a negative trait. And because of this, I wouldn't want to have a filtered version where they say something different instead. That would be highly reducing. Just provide a muting option so that someone like myself can still see them swear but doesn't have to hear it.

I love this movie probably for the same reason all of ""The Dude's"" followers love it; because true humor is in irony and in character, not situation. The depth of character in this film is unsurpassed, and I won't go into it as it is obvious and already commented on by everyone else.

Part of the irony is in the plot (as much as I hear people say that there isn't one). You have this whole mystery that we as an audience are, every once in a while, trying to figure out, all the while ""The Dude"" (the first person perspective in this movie) is coming to his own conclusions (which may or may not be correct). The irony being that it is usually through this perspective that we form ours.

Regardless, it is all tied up in the end.

I don't know... It is pretty difficult to surmise this movie in a commentary. You just have to get around someone who gets it and throw a line out at them. ""Look, I don't roll on Shombus Dude,"" or how about the way ""The Shesus"" goes to tell the neighborhood that he is a child - you know what - and the scene cuts just as he opens his mouth in front of this huge guy with murder written across his face.

Priceless!

It was this movie that got me hooked on the Coen brothers' movies. I have seen half a dozen of them so far. Most of them are great, although I can't say that any of them are as good as this one.

Since the day I saw the movie in the theatre, ""The Dude"" has been my alias. The unfortunate reality, however, is that most of the people that witness this alias of mine only understand the previous Neanderthalic - stigmatic usage of the term ""Dude,"" as in the ""Bill & Ted's"" type of reference. But then, I just have to remember how ""The Dude"" would react to such a misunderstanding... He wouldn't care at all.

As a great man once said, ""The Dude abides!""

That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent.  I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.

First of all, the dialog specifically.  Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned.  This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible.  Was the dialog even written down?  Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character.  It's amazing to behold.

Secondly, the storyline's general arch.  Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back.  In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly.  The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations.  Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully.  This movie could not have ended any other way.

Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack.  Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly.  Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude.  Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.

And now we FINALLY, FINALLY have a three-disc special edition of the brilliance.  This was long overdue.  I loved my other copy because I love movies more than extras, but man is it good to know that this has been given some more treatment.  Now we have all the more materials to use to love this work of art better than ever before!

995249,5,6304994540,"Life is chaos.  At any given time, multiple events take place throughout the world that could affect any given individual within the period from now until an unset moment sometime in the future.  A myriad of different occurrences could happen at any given time, and how a person reacts to one of these events will determine the direction of the person's life.  Thus, the individual possesses some power to steer their own life depending on how they act on the event in life.  However, these events are distilled into a few sure incidents that will certainly happen to us all and a few predetermined occurrences emerge such as conception, aging, and death.  Aging people accumulate experiences that they either assimilate or alter to fit their view of life, usually in a pleasant and comfortable manner.  The Coen Brother's existential comedy The Big Lebowski introduces the audience to a protagonist, Jeffrey Lebowski a.k.a. The Dude (Jeff Bridges), who merely allows life to pull him in whatever direction it wants, as long as he can visit the local bowling alley, sip on his White Russians, and enjoy the freedom of no responsibilities.

A thoughtful opening displays the parched environment outside Los Angeles while panning forward until it presents a nightly overview of the smoggy city.  The camera follows lonely drifting tumbleweed, which suggestively brings the mind to the external forces that operate within the universe.  Simultaneously, the Stranger's (Sam Elliott) voice presents a prologue that succeeds to be exceptionally vague in its explanation to why this is a pertinent tale (but it is significant as it affects us all - life that is.)  The dry tumbleweed eventually reaches the Pacific Ocean, which analogously provides the notion of the cyclical pattern of life, as the Stranger informs the viewer about when and where the story begins.

The story begins in a supermarket dairy aisle where the Dude, dressed in a bathrobe and slippers, stumbles to find some half-and-half for his White Russians.  Untroubled by his existence he returns home after this late night visit to the store, but to his astonishment discovers that two thugs are waiting for him.  One of these witless ruffians brutalizes him with the help of a toilet while the other urinates on his rug before they realize that that they got the wrong man.  They are looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski whom they intended to extort, as this turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.  Nonetheless, the Dude expresses his irritation about the urine on his rug to his bowling buddies, the bipolar and anxiously edgy Vietnam vet Walter (John Goodman) and the timid and verbally abused Donny (Steve Buscemi).  Walter suggests that the Dude should visit the Mr. Lebowski and explain to him that he owns him a new rug because someone soiled his rug due to him having the same name.

The visit with Mr. Lebowski steers the Dude on a path unlike his character, as he has to act on the events taking place in his life and be responsible for his actions.  At the same time, he tries to be himself, lax and calm, while neglecting life (he even calls himself the Dude, which might be an allusion to that he tries to reduce his own existence to nothingness.)  However, the series of events that he triggered by requesting a new rug is set into action and numerous dubious characters begin to enter his previously calm life.  The story snowballs into a potpourri of intriguing characters such as viscously bowling pederast Jesus (John Turturro), the manipulative trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid), and the artistic stepdaughter (Julianne Moore).  All these characters provide windows of opportunity for the Dude.  Yet nothing seems to motivate the Dude to strive for an accomplishment, as he merely allows the people around him to maneuver his existence.  There are a couple of scenes when Walter's over-sensitive presence enhances the cinematic moment, as he thrusts his demandingly selfish perspective on life toward others including the Dude and Donny.

The Big Lebowski is an over the top comedy with frequent displays of symbolism in regards to existential philosophy.  The symbolism emerges mostly through the different characters and their actions, but it also evolves throughout the films visual expression such as the tumbleweed rolling down the Pacific beach.  However, the story of the Dude also provides interesting implications to the invisible force of social interaction and the dynamic consequence of initial action, which brings the mind to the butterfly effect and chaos theory.  The chaos pattern is noticeable throughout the film in the mise-en-scene, story line, dream sequence, and the behavior of some characters.  The film also touches on static features of life such as conception, aging, and death while cinematically remaining aware of the human factor by introducing nihilism, moral values, and religion among many other facets.  The multilayered tale that the Coen Brothers expose exhibits colorful and cerebral writing that together with a brilliant cast accentuates the film's many angles and thoughts.  The Big Lebowski truly is a cinematic gem that radiates humor, wisdom, and aptitude with a progressing (it gets better each time I see it) and remarkable intensity, which will not drift into some unused space of the brain.

The Coen Brother's who frequently work together to show that it is possible to make an artistically dense film with much humor and suspense that keeps a large number of audience members' attention from the beginning to the end.  Here in the Big Lebowski the Coen's succeed to submit a cinematic experience untouched by the corporate movie industry, which stands outside the formulaic approach often used to capture viewer's attention.  Not only do they make a unique film, they also conceive a visual experience that continues to unravel new ideas and concepts after the initial viewing.  In a sense, the film allows the viewer to reach out and build on the film themselves with their own knowledge and wisdom, which permits the audience to increase their own understanding of the world and its many secrets.  Ultimately, this chaotic, yet brilliant film, offers a visual experience that is a necessity in any film lovers library.",1130457600,,6264,5.066212268743914
995250,5,6304994540,"The plot is simple enough: Stoned loser is mistaken for someone else, and accidentally becomes caught up in what may or may not be a kidnapping, occasionally accompanied by his slightly crazed bowling pal. We've all seen that a million times. But as usual, the Coen brothers deliver a movie  that's unlike anything you've ever seen- dream sequences that echo Busby Berkly musicals, starring the stoned, robe wearing Dude? A mustachioed cowboy- played by Sam Elliott- who shows up briefly to provide a bit of narration and perspective? What's going on here? What's going on is  an outrageous, hilarious comedy probably unlike any film you've ever seen. It's good natured throughout, even at its most (seemingly) violent moments. Like all Coen Brothers films it's filled with memorable characters- John Turutrro's violet clad bowler, Steve Buscemei's dimwitted ""Donny"", an entirely over the top John Goodman as The Dude's wound way too tight bowling partner, Phillip Seymour Hoffman in yet another of his curious little characters, and many more.

995251,4,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski needs no introduction to its legions of fans, but we get just that: a brand new introduction by Mortimer Young of Forever Young film preservation.  This Coen brothers' character gives a short introduction to, as he calls it, ""The Grand Lebowski.""  There's a little more to this DVD than a silly introduction.  Improved picture and sound quality bring some welcome improvements to the watching experience, but only to discerning ears.  Unfortunately, modern commercial DVD tactics infiltrate the Dude's new disc, with previews automatically popping up at the beginning.

 The quality of the sound is improved over the original DVD version.  Though the menu music sounds decidedly low-fi, the movie itself sounds great; one Lebowski urban achiever who screened this collector's edition with me noticed at least two places in the first ten minutes where the audio has been cleaned up from the original DVD release, starting right off the bat with the opening song Tumbling Tumbleweeds.  The movie does sound better than the original DVD.

 The image quality appears to be improved over the first version, and it can be fairly noticeable in nighttime scenes.  The first dream sequence displays a very sharp night view of Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, other parts of the movie are not as nice, with some artifacts and noise popping up in the blue sky; these minor problems can be fairly easily overlooked, though.  On the whole, though, the video is improved over the original DVD release.

 The special features are nothing to write home about - a pre-programmed three minute 20 second slide show are all we get of Jeff Bridges's photography from the film's set, though a few interesting shots and notes pop up.  Simply getting a behind the scenes look is interesting, though not alone worth paying to buy the movie again.  The Production Notes contain a few bits of trivia, but nothing too revelatory for most Lebowski fanatics.

 The improved image and sound quality will be a welcome improvement to audio and videophiles, but the video is not as flawless as one may expect.  If you don't already own a copy, pick up the new version, the improved images are worth a couple extra dollars.

 The biggest questions for many Lebowski fans may be, ""Should I buy this again?  Do I need a second copy of Lebowski for my collection?""  If you have a little spare cash in your budget, rediscover the movie with a slightly better image version and much clearer audio.  But let's hope for something much better in the future; this may be a ringer, but it's filled with something better than just the dirty undies, man.",1130025600,,2620,4.886621315192744

It's no coincidence that there are some Germans in this movie, even one floating drunk in the Lebowski pool. There are Germans everywhere. That's because nihilism is the pervasive philosophy of our times, for better or for worse, for the right wing (Mr. Lebowski) and the left (Jeff Lebowksi).

Released in the late `90's, but occurring around ""Desert Storm"", ""The Big Lebowski"" tells of The Dude's misadventures after being sucked into what appears to be a kidnapping involving his wife.  (During pot-smoking binges, little bits of The Dude's existence boil out - incl. his credit in some past Hollywood movies which doubtlessly provide for his meager and undemanding existence.)  Only, The Dude's never been married - the kidnap really involves the wife of another Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire who is everything the Dude is not.  While The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) rules from a palatial estate, The Dude's existence boils down to weed, ""White Russians"" and bowling with Donnie (understated Steve Buscemi) and Walter (Coen Bros. fave John Goodman).  When his rich doppelganger's complications spill over on The Dude (literally, on one of the Dude's favorite rugs), The Dude decides to take the fight over to the big man himself - necessarily getting himself sucked into Big Lebowski's machinations.

Unfortunately, the best laid plans of mice, men and two Lebowskis are steamrolled by Walter - a one-man weapon of mass destruction.  Early on we see how far Walter will go to protect his ideals on bowling, and he soon buts his way into the schemes of the two Lebowskis to the frustration of everybody.  The Coen brothers's script tosses in a squad of nihilists (including indie rocker Aimee Mann), a master pornographer (Ben Gazzara), theft of the Dude's car, various hallucinations involving bowling, Big Lebowski's affected performance-artist of a Daughter (Julianne Moore) and a mysterious stranger played by Sam Elliot.

It's easy to dismiss this flick as a Coen Bros. version of ""The Big Sleep"" - the parallels are there in terms of plot and spirit.  (I prefer to view it an unofficial Coen Bros. sequel to ""Tron"", in which the ordered existence of cyberspace of the first movie has been eroded as mankind has begun to stumble into it via the worldwide web.  When you compare the people involved in programming in '82 to those involved in cyberspace by Netscape's IPO, it's not a difficult image.)  While others have easily written this off as a comedy of mistaken identity, it's more accurate to praise this flick as a shining example of the mistake-of-identity - nobody is what they seem by the end of the flick: despite his pot smoking, The Dude will experience moments of lucidity; Walter will adhere to Orthodox Judaism even though he's Polish Catholic, and by the end of the flick will give a eulogy for a character that has nothing to do with that character; Donnie will wear numerous personalized shirts - none of which actually bear his name; a flamboyant bowler named ""Jesus"" will be revealed to be a sex-offender; neither Lebowski nor his ""wife"" are what they seem; the nihilists aren't all that nihilistic.

At the heart of the movie is a conflict between the Chandler-style plot (which begins to unravel) and the movie's will to be another fun, if preposterous Coen Brothers movie in the vein of ""Oh Brother"" and ""Raising Arizona"".  At some point, the Coens win out over Chandler, but that leaves the winners with a hollow shell of a movie - which retroactively becomes as rootless and inconsequential as The Dude himself.  In short, it's a fun flick that you shouldn't be ready to look into as deeply as I have.",1124668800,,3516,4.903878583473862
995374,5,6304994540,"I parody the title of their great Country/Blues musical as the gloss seems to have tarnished on the most recent undertakings of these entertaining masters of popular cinema. All their work is worth watching. But it's the 'Big Lubowski' that we regularly revisit for a full-bellied laugh. I mean, Jeff Bridge's Dude, well, 'it's just good to know he's out there,' as the film's cowboy narrator quips laconically at the bar. The characters are brilliantly conceived cliches: the middle-aged detritus of the 60s. 'Metallica' roadie(Bridges) and Vietnam vet(Goodman) contend with big money racketeers of the 90s. There's the stony performance artist(Moore) who wants a baby donor without the encumbrance of a husband, a porn star nympho married to the geriatric cripple Lubowski, whose suspect alliance is the cause of a kidnapping scam. It's all comic-strip speed and synchronised to the cannonading commotion of the bowling alley. Oh the cameos! The snake-hipped Jesus bowler strutting at the head of the lane(Turturro), and the whippet-faced loser, Donny(Busconi). The Dude's flashbacks induced by weed, kelhua, knockout beltings or acid flashbacks, are brilliant. The story is preposterous, but we, like the Dude, just roll with the punches. Goodman's dementia is one of his finest screen acts. His final folly, first piling the memory of Donny onto the corpse of his Vietnam experience, then allowing the Pacific updraft to dowse the Dude in their deceased mate's ashes, is a hoot. Goodman stands pathetically knock-kneed, trying to make up to the Dude with a cuddle that he knows is appropriate but is too repressed to enjoin. Damn it.

Check out one of the other reviews for that; and there are some good ones.  I just want to express how excellent this movie is, and recommend it to anyone and everyone.  You don't have to be a bowler, stoner, or nihilist to enjoy this classic.  You don't even have to be a fan of well-made, beautifully filmed, and hilariously-directed, albeit directionless, comedy.

Or maybe you're in the mood for a send-up of a detective story gone completely awry.  I don't know.  But the film has appeal, no doubt about it, as anyone who has attended or seen pictures of a Lebowski Fest will attest. ( I'm still trying to convince my wife that a week of vacation spent at one these Fests is a worthwhile escapade.)  Whether I make it to a celebration of what-have-you or not, I've always got The Dude.  And I don't know about you, but I take a bit of comfort in that, knowing he's out there, taking it easy for all us sinners.  Aw, shucks.  I sure hope he makes the finals.

Their chemistry is very natural, like that of two brothers. The writing is spectacular! There's really nothing bad or wrong about this film. I own it, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old.

I will say that the entire cast is brilliant. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I think my favorite character in the movie is Donny played by Steve Buscemi (my favorite actor of all time), he just seems to know the exact right moment to jump in and say random things like ""what do you mean, dude?"" and ""huh?"". The movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple.",1121299200,,644,4.0390625
995460,2,6304994540,"After watching Fargo, I read about this movie and thought that I should see it because I just loved Fargo. But, this movie was very strange. Very strange and weird. The cast in this movie is simply amazing with Jeff Bridges, the brilliant John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jullianne Moore and John Turturro. But, the movie just didn't do it for me. It certainly had some good jokes and great acting but it had WAY TOO MANY CURSE WORDS and was just so weird. I mean, it's weird when you see a topless lady on a trampoline going up and down on the screen. And that happened a couple of times. Weird. Also, if you decide to watch this, make sure that you aern't sensitive towards the F word because it's used A LOT. I mean, there rarely is a sentence that John Goodman or Jeff Bridges doesn't use it. When they didn't, I was like: ""Dude! It's a miracle!""

So be prepared to hear a lot of naughty words. I mean hundreds and hundreds of them, every 10 seconds, you'll probably hear one. So, that kind of frustrated me. Also, the weirdness was like over the top. I mean it was so weird. When Jeff Bridges would be high and have those weird visions or when the topless lady would jump up and down. I mean there was some pointless and weird stuff. I guess when the dude thinks that he's flying is pretty funny.

Anyway, now to the plot. The plot was about a guy named Jeffrey ""the dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who is mistaken with another Lebowski guy who is really rich. The dude gets really peeved when some guys mistake him for the rich Lebowski and pee on his rug. So, the due is mad. The dude is into doing drugs, drinking white russians, and bowling with his pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goddman). Donny is really funny and says really random stuff. Walter is a hot temepered Vietnam vet. When the rich Lebowski's wife is kidnapped, they ask the dude to deliver the ransom. But, Walter, Donny and the dude get into a lot of a mess with the kidnappers, the cops, a porn ring and some german wackos who threathen to remove the dude's ""johnson"". The plot is great and there are some good funny moments. Believe me, there are some good laughs. Walter's great as is the dude. But, Jesus (John Turturro) is really weird and pointless in the movie. John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Busemi are all excellent in the movie. As is Jullianne Moore. But a lot of F words and a lot of random weird stuff make this one dissapointing. Personally, I feel that the Coen Brothers must have been on drugs while making this because it's very weird.

""No, I'm the dude. Or his dudness o el duderino."" That was hilarious as was Walter's hot temper and Donny's stupidity.

But, the weirdness of this movie was just too overwhelming, the conclusion was gruesome and disgusting and could have been done differently (no biting needed) and I don't know about everyone else, but I don't like hearing the F word said SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!

As the 2nd Coen Brothers movie that I have seen, I strongly recommend the masterpiece that is Fargo, but not this one. Well, I'm still going to give Barton Fink and Raising Arizona a chance.",1121299200,,3130,4.484210526315789

There is a case of mistaken identity and the Dude is visited by some thugs who want the other Lebowski's money.  Shortly afterwards, the Kidnapping begins and we are led on one crazy adventure that is truly rewarding with laughs and artistic originality.  Also, knowing that this was released around the time of the Gulf War is helpful because then you are able to get one of the jokes in one of The Dude's many ""trips"".

I might be crazy but the sasporila drinking cowboy-narator brings the war up. Sadaam hands the protaganist the Dude (Bush) bowling shoes in a dream sequence. Goodman plays a stereotypical viet vet as humorosly as possible representing our military's tacticly static higher ups. Donny's (Buechimi) a third in the group who wonders haplessly into conversations only to be chastised by Goodman's character. He is the public. The nearly aimless reign of Sadaam is represented by nialist stereotypical Germans. Who cut off a girlfriends toe to fake a ransom to someonse with the Dudes last name - the Big Lebowski. Some guys pee on his rug (Kuwait). He grabs another. Because Bunny owed the local pornographer money. One nialist appeared in a film with Bunny. She is the Big Lebowski's nympho wife. He is big buisness. He hires the Dude to handoff money for Bunny's safety  and is let down by the Dude and his militaristic buddy.  The nialists faked her kidnapping and the Dude is strongly discouraged by a pornographer (the press) from envestigating her absence. She is innocent casualties.

  That being said, this is the one movie that I never get sick of watching.  Never.  The characters, and I mean ALL of the characters, are excellent here, most of all John Goodman.  I love the Coen Brothers' movies because the acting in them is almost always superb and characters act in a very realistic, life-like way. But this one takes the cake.  Like other reviewers have said, the dialogue in this movie is hilarious.  Not only that, but it is ingenious.  On multiple viewings, you start to notice the little things that the characters do that make it that much funnier (like Walter's facial expressions in the bowling alley when he and The Dude are arguing).  I can understand why not everyone would like this movie. It does get a little weird in parts.  For instance, there are some dream sequences that, as I have witnessed, make people leave and quit watching the movie.  This is not because they are gruesome or malicious, but because they are a little hallucinagenic (is this even a word?) or ""out there"" I guess you could say.

Its critical rejection, neglect by the academy awards, and poor box office showing remain inexplicable to me.  Apparently the post-Fargo expectations did not conform with what resulted.  I have this to say: Fargo pales in comparison to the Big Lebowski and people should have been enthusiastic about such an explosion of creativity and talent as they received with this most unique of comedies.  'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is the only other movie that has ever made me laugh as much.  I guess the Big Lebowski just wasn't 'commercial' enough.

  In singing its praises there are hundreds of places to begin.  John Goodman's explosive performance as Walter is the first thing that comes to my mind; he is phenomenal and should have been showered with awards.  As a slightly unhinged, tempermental, loudmouthed, incompetent war veteran who is neurotically obsessed with Vietnam and his ex-wife he is jaw-droppingly funny.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout as a chuckling, uptight, obsequeous toady.  Jeff Bridges fits right into his role as The Dude, one of the only unemployed pot-smoking bums to be the hero of a movie.  The dialogue is electrifying, the acid flashbacks are weird and funny, the sountrack is used to beautiful effect, and the plot unfolds in the most convoluted way possible, until we come to the ultimate anti-climactic denouement, that will irritate many and have others choking with laughter.

It pushes the bounds of postmodern filmmaking (read: absence of any solid plot) to a great degree. A cowboy narrator, avant-garde hipsters, German nihilists, bowling, '60s music, amputed toes, killer ferrets, TONS of f-bombs, sex, and acid flashbacks are all involved.

The humor comes from the Dude, and his two friends (played by Steve Buscemi and John Goodman), and their goofiness trying to maintain their own limited status quo.

This film was a bomb at the box office, but has become a cult classic to some.  However, I stand firmly in the middle.  The film was okay, and funny at times, and I found myself repeating a few of the lines, for a long time.  However, the story is kind of chaotic and in essence based around nothing.  With very limited emotional appeal, as the Dude's attempt to get his mediocre life on tract just seems rather simple, there is nothing to draw the audience's attention too.

Seen as it was intended, it's engaging and very, very funny. (The plot is still almost incomprehensible, but as the Coen Bros. point out in the ""making of"" featurette, nobody understands the plot of ""The Big Sleep"" either.)

And that's their central idea:  An LA Noir mystery, with all the plot convolutions typical of the genre, but with the added twist that the ""detective"" slot is filled by their stoner anti-hero, ""the Dude"".  Jeff Bridges' perfomance as the latter is a bent masterpiece that deserves repeated viewing.

I would rank ""Lebowski"" just below ""Fargo"" and ""O Brother"" as one of the Coen's best - - Similar in many ways to ""Raising Arizona.""  As the years pass, the fact that it originally flopped at the box office just gives it more appeal as a cult classic.

995591,5,6304994540,"The film focuses on a man named Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski ( Jeff Bridges). The Dude is a man that spends his days smoking weed and bowling. The story kicks into action when a pair of thugs, break into his apartment and mistake The Dude for a millionaire with the same name. The thugs demand money, and to get their point across, one of them ruins The Dude's favorite rug by urinating on it. When The Dude discovers that there is a millionaire with his name, he attempts to seek compensation in the form of a new rug. The millionaire refuses to give The Dude a new rug and claims that it is not his fault. Shortly after, the millionaire's young wife (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, and the millionaire agrees to give The Dude a new rug if he helps to get his wife back. The Dude sets out to save the millionaire's wife with the help of his best friend Walter(John Goodman) and soon finds himself thrust into a world of violence and intrigue that upsets his easy going way of life.

Only the Cohen Brothers could come up with a film like this. The story, wide variety of interesting characters, and the overall uniqueness that the film posesses provide for a funny and enjoyable film. Jeff Bridges gives the best performance of his career as The Dude. His extremely laid back and lazy lifestyle will have you laughing for the majority of the film. The character is so lazy, that he writes a check for 69 cents at one point in the film. Jeff Bridges nailed the role so well that you would think that he really smokes. John Goodman gives one of the best, if not the best role of his career as The Dude's best friend and Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak. Walter's unique viewers on life and his constant use of profanity will have you cracking up for the whole movie. Some other great performances came from John Turturo as an eccentric bowler named Jesus and Juliane Moore as an erotic artist named Maude whose art consists of lying naked on a canvas. I was also particulary impressed with the camera work in this movie. At times, the camera offers a view from inside the holes of a bowling ball.

The Big Lebowski is probably one of the funniest and most creative films that I have ever seen. Despite the fact that the film appears to be stupid on paper, the actors involved and other unique aspects of this movie will keep you laughing and entertained for the entire film.

995593,4,6304994540,"Some might claim the penultimate Noir for our time is David Fincher's Se7en: dark, twisted, a chilling glimpse of the evil in all of us.  Although, to be honest, I'm kind of sick of evil.  And Se7en only drove this home for me.  Evil is gross.  I'd rather not dwell on it for any length of time.  I'm a child of the 80's and 90's, with no attention span and cynical as hell.  I love dark films, but I don't want to sit through two hours of an intense study of the seven deadly sins.  Not really my idea of entertainment.

And then it hit me.  The unlikely Noir for our times.  It has all the requirements: a detective story, conflict of evil and the dubious hero, the femme fatale.  But it's new, fresh, and ultimately enlightening about the way we as citizens of the 21st century confront sin.  It's The Big Lebowski.

What the Coen Brothers have done in their quirky comedy is to turn Noir on its head.  Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"", a lazy, out of work bowling guru, is the stand-in for all of us.  He embodies our Saturday morning selves, the kind of people we wish we could be when we sit at our monotonous desk jobs staring out the window in a daydream.

The evil confronting him is sinister, yet simple.  Identity confusion results in the soiling of The Dude's rug.  His quest is straightforward-after being mixed up in the confusing personal affairs of the Big Lebowski (a self-made success and paraplegic), his daughter Maude (an artist resentful of her father's fortune and the unexpected romance), the trophy wife Bunny (a former porn star who owes money all over town), and Jackie Treehorn (the playboy to whom Bunny is indebted), The Dude simply states, ""All The Dude ever wanted was his rug back.""

Corruption, lies, and sexual scandal confront The Dude and his two sidekicks.  Walter (masterfully played by John Goodman) is a Vietnam veteran living in the past, resentful of all who he sees as opposed to truth, justice, and the American way, and Donnie (played by the odd-ball Steve Buscemi) is the tag-along token friend the other two love and ignore.  And through the eyes of the camera, we suddenly realize that the intensely serious and befuddling dilemmas and situations facing The Dude and his friends are actually an enormous joke.  We laugh at their problems, the difficulties with which they face them, and even the solutions to the disasters they are up against.

And by the end, what is the conclusion we draw?  Our narrator (Sam Elliot), who himself is comically aware of both his presence in the movie and his distinctive position over it, offers us the moral of the story: ""I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that-The Dude, taking `er easy for all us sinners.""

And so, the movie swings full circle.  The Dude, the embodiment of our lazy, cynical, casually indifferent wistful selves, has become our savior.  He is the stand in for our sins, he has the solution, the ultimate answer for our daily confrontation with the evil in our lives.  Every time our rug is miterated on, every time we are mixed up in deception and lies, every time we are abused by those with power and authority over us, we turn to The Big Lebowski for our salvation.  And The Dude is there for all us sinners, because he knows how to handle evil in the world and in ourselves: not with the solutions preached at us for years, not with cunning, sleuthing, or anything classical Noir has to offer, but with a simple and effective answer.

Forget it Dude.  Let's go bowling.",1099612800,,3484,4.553054662379421

995597,5,6304994540,"After the darkly surreal, snow swept landscapes of the Minnesota, depicted in Fargo, the Coen brothers wisely opted for a different locale and tone with bright, comedic vibe of The Big Lebowski. The film was just too odd for mainstream audiences and promptly tanked at the box office. However, it found new life on video and has since become a cult film favourite, inspiring countless websites and even an annual convention known as the Lebowski Fest that has been running for three years!

The Coens are not known for providing many extras with the video releases of their films so it is a pleasant surprise to see a couple included with this fine disc.

First off, there is a nice teaser trailer that is presented in its original theatrical format and features an excellent montage of the important characters from the film complete with the Kenny Rogers and the First Edition song, ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"" that plays during the ""Gutterballs"" dream sequence.

The disc also includes an entertaining 30 minute promotional video entitled, ""The Making of The Big Lebowski."" While not nearly as informative or exhaustive as the book of the same name that was released in conjunction with the film, this promo is worth watching if only to see Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and, in particular, the interview-shy Coens talk about their film.

Lastly, there is the standard cast and filmmaker biographies/filmographies which features nothing that you couldn't get from a press kit or the official website. Pretty standard stuff.

I daresay that The Big Lebowski is the Coen brothers' best film to date. It is the perfect mix of their flashy style, eccentric characters, and distinctive dialogue. It is a rare comedy that can be watched over and over and never get old. The richly detailed world that is so inviting and entertaining that you want to revisit it again and again.

Without a doubt, my personal favorite cult classic comedy. (don't know if it's reached ""cult classic"" status yet or no, but i'm going to go ahead and assume it has - what makes a cult classic anyway?)

This film will keep your interest for the long haul, also with considerable replay value - there are always little jokes and surprises that you may have missed the first viewing or two - quite a bit of almost Monty Python-esque satire and dry humor to keep you laughing for hours.

Jeff Bridges plays the best slacker i've ever seen on film - long hair, bathrobe and slippers at all times, and a drink in his hand about 90 percent of the time as well!

John Goodman is about as intense and intimidating a figure as he could be while still portraying a character in a comedy, I beleive Goodman truly stole the show in this one. Buscemi is good as well, even with his small role.

Julianne Moore is strange, yet intriguing, and adds a form of love interest to the plot (well... kind of)

The plot is a LA, Raymond Chandler style mystery; it's hard to tell the bad guys and femme fatales without a scorecard.

(2000), and I can say I've never been disappointed, and that certainly holds true for The Big Lebowski (1998), the film, not received well by the critics, they made after their Oscar winning film Fargo (1996).  While it may not have been a critical success, it is one of my favorite films, and one the rarely gathers dust on my shelf, as I've seen it a few times.
The film boasts quite a cast of actors including Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Jullianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Ben Gazzara, Sam Elliot along with a few veterans of previous Coen brothers films like Steve Buscemi, John Tuturro, and Peter Stormere.  So what is the film about?  Well, I'll tell you...The film, which takes place in California in the early 90's, starts off with a little expository by a narrator known as The Stranger (Sam Elliot) giving us a little detail about the main character, Jeffery Lebowski aka The Dude, played by Bridges, who seems to have put on a bit of weight for the role, and sports long hair much like that he had when he was in the 1976 flopperino remake of King Kong.  Anyway, the first thing you notice about The Dude is he is extremely laid back, very possibly a casualty of the California counterculture of the 60's and early 70's who seems perfectly content to take each day as it comes.  While returning to his modest rental home one night, he finds two thuggish men waiting for him, one who soon acquaints The Dude's head with the inside of The Dude's toilet, while the other decides to despoil The Dude's living room rug in the manner of a unhousebroken dog.  Seems these two men work for a smut peddler named Jackie Treehorn, and are looking to collect money owed to Mr. Treehorn by Jeffery Lebowski's wife, Bunny (Reid).  Only thing is they got the wrong Jeffery Lebowski.  Seeking reimbursement for his rug, The Dude visits the other Jeffery Lebowski, an older, well-to-do wheelchair bound man whose young trophy wife seems to have amassed quite a debt to a number of people, including Mr. Treehorn.  This meeting sets into motion a complicated series of events including kidnapping which evolves into a mystery, a ransom request for one million dollars, a suitcase of dirty underwear, a stolen car, an altercation with nihilists, various beatings, guns, a bowling tournament, interpretive dance, a sexual liaison, a ferret, some drugs, painting in the nude, the removal of a toe, a wicky drug-induced dream sequence, copious amounts of profanity and even a death, all with The Dude right smack in the middle.
Jeff Bridges is wonderful as The Dude, a laid back individual with a self awareness few possess having to deal with harshness put upon him by circumstances just always a bit out of his control.  He ends up basically going with the flow, finally stumbling on a moment of clarity as the mystery resolves itself.  The funniest scenes usually involve The Dude, his friend and bowling teammate Walter Sobchek (Goodman), and fellow friend Donny (Buscemi) as their conversations, riddled with ludicrous tangents, usually devolve into heated debates and personal attacks, usually with Donny getting the worst of it.  One of the things I like so much about this film is there is just so much going on, much of which may seem unrelated to the main plot, but I think it's purposeful, weaving an thick, intricate, colorful tapestry right before your eyes and definitely requires numerous viewings, just to soak it all up.  There is definitely a beginning, a middle, and an end here, but the path between is very convoluted at times, but not confusing, if that makes sense.  Normally I dislike dream sequences in films, as they often tend to be a mish mash of stylistic tripe, but the one in this film was truly enjoyable and laden with symbolism relating to the events preceding it, and even utilizes a song I consider to be a classic in that of Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition.  It was funny, because the core of the story is based on a mystery, but I spent little time in trying to decipher it, as I was so intrigued with everything that was going on, the related and seemingly unrelated material.  A word of warning, though, as I've mentioned before, there is a good amount of profanity throughout the film, so if you are easily offended, you might steer clear of this movie.
The film is offered in both wide screen and full screen format, and the picture quality is good, but not as good as I would have expected with such a recent release.  Some scenes seemed a bit dark, and there was a slight fuzziness at times, but nothing very notable unless you are seated very close to the screen (I normally refrain from getting so picky, but I've seen this film a number of times).  Special features are pretty slim, including a 30-minute interview with the Coen brothers on the making of the film, along with a teaser trailer and cast biographies.  I didn't care for presentation much, as after putting the disc in your player, you are directed to pick a format, wide screen or full screen, and the movie would start playing, skipping entirely over the menu, presenting it only after completion of the film, or by pressing the menu button on the remote.  This is most common on older or extremely cheap releases (this was originally released in 1998, and then again in 2003 with no enhancements or changes).  If any film was ripe for an enhanced special edition re-release, this is it.

995687,4,6304994540,"This movie begins with a meandering voiceover by Sam Elliot that wanders around in several different directions before he pauses to admit that he has lost his place and forgot what the hell he was talking about...

The script wanders about too, but it's a good trip.  The script is a Coen Brother's specialty, with characters who are not very smart, or at least not nearly as smart as they think they are.  Jeff Bridges plays ""The Dude"", a likeable loser of a Californian who unfortunately shares the same last name as ""The Big Lebowski"", a wealthy older man with a trophy ex-porn star wife who owes bad characters money.  The Dude's chief social activity consists of drinking White Russians, being stoned, and hanging out with his bowling team.  The Dude's team includes John Goodman as a Vietnam Vet who doesn't think twice about trying to double-cross criminals to make off with a million bucks of ransom money, or pulling a gun on a rival bowler who makes a minor infraction, stepping across the line during league play.  Steve Buscemi is on the team as well.  It has been noted that another Coen trademark is bizarre manners of death for Buscemi characters.

To try to describe the plot would meander worse than Sam Elliot's opening narration, but by the end Sam shows up in person (looking great as usual beneath a cowboy hat) to tell the Dude that he likes his style.

The Big Leboski is my favorite movie of all time.  The fact that it came out immediately after the Coens' huge success with Fargo kind of gave this flick the kiss of death, but to those of us that didn't care (and I liked Fargo...just not as much as I liked Raising Arizona), this is probably their finest achievement, and probably the best comedy ever.  The great thing about this movie is that THERE IS NO PLOT.  That's not to say that the movie is aimless, rather the actual story, involving the alleged kidnapping of Bunny Lebowski is the film's ""McGuffin."" (I think that's how it's spelled).  Granted, Hitchcock probably would never dream of making the reason for the characters' interactions a plot device (which begs the question, how can you have a plot device with no plot?), but Hitchcock isn't Joel and Ethan Coen.  So, what we have here is a rag-tag group of characters, led in complete Dude fashion, by The Dude himself.  Along with Walter, Donnie, Jeff Lebowski (""the REAL Jeffrey Lebowski""), Bunny, Jesus Quintana, Maude, and countless other priceless, though minor characters (all three cops), Dom Irrera's limo driver, Jackie Treehorn, the nihilists, etc, etc, The Dude hobbles his way through easily the most interesting days of his life (though he was a roadie for Metallica on the ""Speed of Sound"" tour).  Anyway, probably the best scene involves Larry Sellers and his father Arthur Digby Sellers (who wrote the bulk of the TV series ""Branded""), and it's too funny and relies too heavily on the f-word to repeat here.
Sorry for all the rambling.  What's important about this movie is the brilliant dialogue.  And virtually every character gets to say absolutely brilliant dialogue, from the main characters all the way down to ancillary characters like The Dude's landlord, the cab driver, and the chief of police of Malibu.  This movie is chock full of characters, brilliant insights into the world of bowling, and life lessons in nihilism.  As long as you're not looking for a story to get lost in, this is absolutely the best you can do in terms of a comedy.  I recommend this movie to anyone that has a sense of humor, or to anyone who needs a sense of humor (note to those that need a sense of humor, you might have to watch this a couple of times...I hear some people didn't ""get it"" the first time).

995692,5,6304994540,"This was the first film that the Coen Brothers released after their wildly popular 1996 hit ""Fargo"", which was a huge success from both a critical and commercial viewpoint.  Unfortunately, it didn't garner the reviews and press that it deserved, and was a box office disappointment.  Deservingly, it seems to have found a second life as a cult film, and has even spawned an annual gathering of fans of the file called Lebowski Fest.
The plot is deceptively simple, as suggested by the description on the box - a hippie that's down on his luck gets mistaken for a billionaire with the same name as his by a couple of thugs, who ""soil"" his rug after he doesn't automatically comply with their demands.  He goes to the home of the billionaire Jeffrey Lebowski hoping to be compensated for his soiled rug, and what follows is absolute insanity - the film is punctuated by several eccentric characters and the clever dialogue that has become associated with all Coen films.  Some have said that this movie is pointless, but I think of it as being ambiguous and open to interpretation.  This movie has the rare achievement of being at once simple and complex.  The Dude is so leisurely and laid back, Walter is the confrontational member of the group, and Donny is the mild-mannered introvert - part of this movie's appeal is that it's easy to relate to the character ... either you know someone that displays similar behavior to one of these characters, or maybe even you have the similarities.  John Turturro (Jesus) steals pretty much every scene he's in - I just wish they would have built up more of an on-screen rivalry than they did.
All told, this is one of the most innovative and original films that has come out in the past few decades, comedic or otherwise.  I can't recommend it enough.",1079913600,,1793,4.66984126984127

This movie had all the chemistry and acting one could ask for in a comedy. The Cohen Brothers with John Goodman & Jeff Bridges have created a movie comedy that blows away anything Cheech & Chong could have ever dreamed of making. The enitire pace of this movie is perfect in everyway. The story, the acting, especially the characters, the non stop comedy, the brilliant filming and soundtrack makes this movie my favorite of all time. I cannot think of a better constructed brilliantly acted & casted movie for everything this movie portrays. The classic one liners in this movie make it unforgetable. In my opinion the Cohens have created a classic. The Choens should highly think about a sequel to this one. Not a huge success at the box office and not admired as much by critics of ""Fargo"", this one was truley the Cohens best by far and a classic missed by many. THE DVD FEATURES on this one are great. The picture quality is top notch and the surround sound is great for the soundtrack. I highly reccommend this movie to anyone besides old ladys that don't like movies  with alot (what I'll call) ""properly placed"" foul language that fits the movie in every way.

He rambles on his way trying to get compensated for a rug that was peed on by some pornographer's goons.
Everything he does to try and remedy the situation seems to be a complete wrong turn and everything about the man is kind of in shambles, but it really does seem to have a feeling of humanity to the character.

The cast is the Coen Brothers' usual odd mix: Jeff Bridges (in the role of The Dude), John Goodman (as The Dude's bowling buddy), Steve Buscemi (also in fargo), Peter Stormare (also in Fargo), and others such as Julianne Moore, who features as an erotic artist.
The plot is not at all that important; it's the weird scenes such as the one in which The Dude is harassed by the nihilists and their 'ferret', bizarre characters, and unpredictability that hold The Big Lebowski together.

The setting is Los Angeles.  The star is Jeff Bridges, cast as a what has come to be called ""a slacker"".  It's never clear how he makes his living.  It seems to spend his days taking baths and smoking a lot of pot.  His one passion is bowling and his best friend and bowling buddy is John Goodman.

995755,5,6304994540,"The Coen brothers followed their kidnapping blunder movie in Minnesota (Fargo) with this kidnapping blunder movie set in Los Angeles. (Add Raising Arizona and you have a trilogy.) They threw together a dozen different ideas, loosely strung into a needlessly complex plot. The main characters were inspired by real people. Their friend Jeff, who helped promote some of their previous films, was used as the model for Jeff Lebowski. (Like the real Jeff, he called himself The Dude.) Walter is based on John Milius, the screenwriter and director of Conan the Barbarian. Then they threw in nihilists, avant-garde art, a funny Busby Berkley-inspired dream sequence, a TV show writer in an iron lung, Saddam Hussein, a ferret in a bathtub, and lots of bowling.

995756,5,6304994540,"""The Big Lebowski"" is a hilarious comedy that disguises itself as something so simplistic, but ends up being nothing of the sort.  If you're looking for a movie with a meaning or a solid and concrete plot, this may be something to skip.  If you're looking for an out-of-control and outrageous comedy with memorable characters and some of the funniest lines ever to be spoken in film, ""The Big Lebowski"" is something that is definitely worth checking out.
The story revolves around a man by the name of Lebowski; actually, he prefers to be called ""The Dude.""  A couple of thugs mistake him for a different Lebowski and ruin his most prized rug that really tied the room together.  Well, The Dude isn't going to stand for that kind of ""unchecked aggression"" (even if he is one of the laziest human beings on the planet).  When he tries to get the other Lebowski to compensate him for his ruined rug, well... let's just say things get very complicated.  And his psychopathic bowling buddy, Walter (who is also a Viet Nam Veteran), doesn't make things any better when he tries to help The Dude with his problems.  But hey, everything's gotta work out in the end, right?  He's The Dude!  He is the man... or at least he better hope so, for his sake.
This is one of my favorite comedies.  Although it is almost impossible for me to do the film justice by reviewing it, I have to because it is a movie that I love and watch on a daily basis.  The dialogue and characters are so entertaining and fun to watch that it is almost impossible not to become captivated by the film.  Jeff Bridges is amazing as The Dude and takes his role to the limit.  John Goodman gives his best performance ever and really steals the show for the majority of the film.  Even though he's only in the movie for a short amount of time, John Turturro is HILARIOUS in his two scenes.  The movie is brilliantly written and directed.  The Coen Brothers have made another gem; that much is for sure.
Be warned, this is no kiddy movie.  If you get easily offended by movies with foul language, STAY CLEAR FROM THIS MOVIE!!  Every other word in the movie is the f-word, and in fact, according to the IMDb, the f-word appears in the movie 267 times.  So please, take that under consideration.  As foul as this movie is, I think it's necessary and works perfectly for the movie.  It makes the characters what they are.  If you've ever seen the watered-down ""TV version"" of the movie, you'll know that it quickly loses its spark and appeal that was so well-established in the regular version.  The language is a necessity in this kind of environment, so it's better to avoid the movie if that's going to upset or offend you.
The DVD doesn't have a lot to offer, so I'm hoping that one of these days a fully-loaded special edition will come out.  Until then, this is what we're stuck with.  The picture and sound quality really shines in this movie.  You can watch the movie in widescreen or standard format.  Special features included are cast/crew information, a teaser trailer, and a 30 minute interview with the Coen Brothers.
""The Big Lebowski"" is a comedy to remember, although it's not a movie for everyone.  It's not a movie to watch if you're looking for something solid or with a standard formula to it.  The film is a wildly unpredictable journey into the unknown.  The film really does a great job of standing out from the other ""predictable"" and ""flat"" comedies that we are plagued with.

A couple of thugs accidently mistake him for another Jeff Lebowski (who turns out to be a millionaire), and after realizing that they've got the wrong person, they proceed to pee on his rug. That's when things are set into motion. The plot itself is actually very complex, but by the end of the movie, everything fits together nice and neatly.
Throughout the movie, we meet lovable and well acted characters such as the Dude's friend and bowling partner, Walter (played by John Goodman). He gives the best performance with his easily enraged, gun-toting personality which is perfectly offset by his devotion to his ex-wife and the way he seems to remember his war buddies from Nam at the most inoppurtune moments. Some of the situations him and the Dude get into are the funniest moments in the movie. Other great performances include Donnie (played by  Steve Buscemi), who is the submissive and somewhat nerdy bowling partner of the Dude and Walter. And a brief, yet hilarious performance is given by John Turturro who plays the hispanic bowling fiend, Jesus (yes, it's pronounced ""Jee-zus"").
One of the things that stand out is the dialogue which really pulls the movie together. The conversations that erupt between the characters flow extremely well and are endlessly quotable. Something that's missing in a lot of comedies these days.
Aside from the the great acting and dialogue, one thing that stands out are the subtle nuances that reward repeated viewings such as the jokes that might've flown right over your head during earlier viewings, pop-culture refrences, or small plot details.
The only thing that really bothered me is the DVD itself. The menues suck, and the only special features include a trailer, a badly done documentary on the movie, and small bios on the cast.

The Duder opens the movie by writing out a personal check for sixty-nine cents to pay for a quart of Half & Half. Unfortunately, he gets involved in a kidnapping (due to mistaken identity) that involves nihlists, pornographers, a rich crippl......er......disabled person, a dunce of a kid, and even a beautiful avant-garde artist played by Julianne Moore. Jeffery Lebowski could not have been portrayed by anyone except Jeff Bridges who absolutely nailed the role. John Goodman provides an outstanding supporting role as the funny but believeable character, Walter. In fact the acting from the whole cast is absolutely first rate and the comedic timing is right on. The music ain't bad either. This DVD is heavily discounted despite the fact it's an outstanding movie, a black comedy classic on a par with Pulp Fiction and beyond.

Would you listen to some CD one time and then form an opinion on it saying its the best/worst CD ever?  MMMMBop would still be on the radio all the time if that was the case.  I think with this movie it can actually be classified as art.  The more you see it, the more you appreciate how good it is.  Ive seen it probably a hundred times and every time I'm surprised by how good the acting really is.  Some of it is pretty subtle (not Jesus though, has there ever been a better supporting character!) but after you see it a few times and aren't focused solely on all the lotta in's, a lotta out's, a lotta what-have-you's (of the story) its possible to recognize the genius.  Not everybody is going to get this movie, in fact if you think Ace Ventura is the funniest movie ever, well, (1)you're stupid, and (2)it's over your head, don't waste your time.  However, if you are like the 900+ other people that attended Lebowskifest (its becoming that ""cult"" of a movie) then check it out.  Again, and again, and again.

995830,5,6304994540,"Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a bowling hippie, the laziest man in Los Angeles County. His rug is pissed on by thugs looking for his homonym, a rich man nicknamed the Big Lebowski. The Dude wants restitution because ""that rug really ties the room together"".
A visit to the Big Lebowski nets him a new rug, if anything, but that one will also be stolen. With his bowling friends Vietnam veteran Walter (John Goodman) and third-wheel Donny (Steve Buscemi) , he soon becomes embroiled in a kidnapping, intrigue, sex, and his never-ending quest to get his rug back.
It is a Coen brothers movie, and keeps their tone throughout - basically a film noir, but this time set in modern days and on an acid trip. Part of the fun is simply watching The Dude encoutering various colourful characters on his simple mission to get his rug back, but failing miserably and getting himself in more and more trouble. He has an acid flashback every time he is knocked unconscious, which leads to some of the most memorable scenes of the movie.
There is also a lot of humour in the characters. The Dude is a happy-go-luck character who bears the chain of events with befuddled aplomb. Walter, the quintessential movie war vetertan, flirts the line of sterotype but the Coen brothers give enough depth to the characters to escape it. Other characters like the Nihilist gang and the daughter of the Big Lebowski, a New Age artist, go above and beyond the call of duty.
The Dude: Let me explain something to you. Um, I am not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.",1064707200,,1700,4.577049180327869

The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, and watching the teaser trailer made me think it was going to be another Kingpin, man. I wasn't wrong, but thankfully, it didn't focus that much on the bowling, dude. This film is a tad off the wall, man. The words ""dude"" and ""man"" are littered amongst the dialogue, you try to block it out, but they seem to emphasis the words each time they say it, dude. Seems to have a few reasonably ""big"" names, including John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore and Tara Reid, but it doesn't seem appear to have that big a budget, man.
Jeff Bridges looks older and slightly greyer than the only other role I've seen him in, `Starman', dude. Steve Buscemi plays a quiet character: he gets ignored, he doesn't know what John Goodman is talking about most of the time and subsequently gets told to shut up, man. The classic line ""dude where's my car"" is uttered so obviously whoever made that, was watching this, dude. Julianne Moore's non-geographical accent gets on my nerves, and she just has to appear naked, man.
The phone seems to constantly ring in this, particularly in the first half, for no apparent reason, and no one seems to answer it - just there to get on the viewer's nerves, dude.
The scene with the naked chick being thrown up and down accompanied by high-pitched music - what exactly was all that about, man? A scene for the guys and what do the girls get, dude? John Goodman's stomach, man.
I laughed a couple of times, but the best bit was when John Goodman throws a bowling ball into the bad guy's nether regions, dude.
Judging by the ending, they must have run out of storyline, or money, man. Also, according to the back of this DVD, it was 98 minutes long, but its 116 minutes, and is listed as 127 minutes in a movie book, dude.
This film is a meandering series of events, vaguely connected, with no real ending, man. You definitely have to be stoned or drunk to watch this, and I was neither, dude.

The Coen brothers are absolutely genius (even though first impressions would lead you to believe that they are incredibly dull). My favorite thing about their movies is that, unlike your typical comedy, they manage to be sidesplittingly funny, but also have excellent plots as well. ""The Big Lebowski"" follows Jeff Lebowski, more commonly known as ""The Dude"", a pothead who likes to go bowling with his buddies. One day two thugs break into his house and demand the money he owes them, but soon find out they were confusing him with another millionaire Jeff Lebowski. They leave, but not without urinating on the rug that made ""the room hang together"". Somehow, The Dude gets involved in delivering ransom money to get back Jeff Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunny, who was kidnapped. With John Goodman playing 'Nam vet Walter hilariously, plenty of swearing, and the use of the word ""Dude"" that makes you want to use it all the time, The Big Lebowski is definitely worth checking out.",1062892800,,1101,4.8

Though Jeff Bridges is the main character, and a fine job he does, the real star is John Goodman, that big jolly man who frequents SNLs and other Coen Brothers movies. Absolutely NO ONE ELSE could pull off the role of Walter, the militaristic Vietnam vet obsessed with his ex-wife, to the point of converting to Judaism and refusing to do anything, including bowling, on the Sabbath. The energy conveyed by Goodman in this role, in particular when fighting the German nihilists, is truly inspiring. Also in fine form is Steve Buscemi as Donnie, the misfit third wheel who is constantly out of his element. Bridges portrays the philosophical slacker with laid back ease. Julianne Moore is unflinchingly brilliant as the ultra-artsy feminist Maude Lebowski. Young Tara Reid, pre- AMERICAN PIE, plays a perfectly idiotic trophy wife, a role she seems born for. And do let us not forget Jesus the Bowler, played with sexual, perverse flair by John Turturro. And the seasoned veteran Sam Elliot does not disappoint as the narrating cowboy.
In more minor areas, the millionaire Lebowski is excellent; the German nihilists, including Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, are menacingly silly; the porn kingpin Jackie Gleeson is an effective slimeball; and the Malibu police officer (""stay out of my beach community, you bum..."") could not be better.
Filled with skillful shots, including one from a bowling ball, repeated references (""It really tied the room together""), and surreal nonsense (""Gutterballs""), this is not to be missed. By any means. The Dude Abides.",1061596800,,1821,5.013201320132013

There is no plotline, no likeable characters, and absolutely no point to this huge mess of a movie.  None of the eccentric characters are even close to funny, and I found myself wondering why in the world they agreed to make this picture.  Julianne Moore is a great actress, but she has absolutely no function in this film.  John Goodman is great at what he does, but in this all he does is run around yelling, bowling, and screaming about Vietnam.  Jeff Bridges just wanders around in his bathrobe for 2 hours muttering ""man, ya know, man"".

995872,4,6304994540,"In what has to be the most brilliantly disjointed and anarchic look at the alienation, apathetic stupor, and pedestrian self-absorption of the pathetic Southern California lifestyle ever filmed, the two Coen brothers (`Fargo') produced and directed this near `cult' film to explore the plethora of cultural cop-outs parading as lifestyles in this zany yet affectionate look at a totally burned out and yet eminently likeable basket case  by the name of Jeff Lebowski, who is played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, in yet another of his consistently underestimated character portrayals. Lebowski prefers to go by his street name of ""Dude"", and seems to be the ultimate California case of a one-time fairly intelligent `n'er-do-well' now perpetually down on his luck and reduced to only occasional flashes of clarity and full functioning after way too many years of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and then some more drugs tossed in on the side.
The Coens' penchant for offbeat characters is having a field day here, with everyone in the cast allowed to vent in a kind of wacko 'Disneyland on the strip' approach to making the endless days of gorgeous LA sunshine pass, as our protagonist finds trouble in the promised land. Particularly memorable here is John Goodman weighing in as the paranoid and unpredictably violent Walter Sobchak, the `Dude's' best friend and perpetual bowling partner. The holy ceremony of bowling and the seriousness that it plays in the lives of the several losers like the Dude, Sobchak, and the preening eccentric Jesus Quintana (a wonderfully over-the-top John Turturro) and the rest of the motley crew on the Dude's team provides a kind of key that unlocks the mystery of their uniformly alienated, pointless, and directionless lives, as each tumbles from crisis to crisis, and with each attempt that Dude makes to cope with the circumstances that mysteriously start to swirl around his drug addled self-absorption and wake him into a groggy yet sober recognition that something very serious and potentially deadly is going on around him, he is repeatedly sabotaged and blind-sided by the myopic and near-psychotic antics of his friends.
Dude seems to approach crisis management as an exercise in spin control, and tries, sometimes quite ingeniously, to talk his way out of the staccato violence that punctuates his days with increasingly urgent frequency. But as the mystery deepens and Lebowski is sucked farther into the quicksand of coincidences, mistaken identities, and sheer madness that lurks just beneath the cover of these friendly skies, we are introduced to the powers and the principalities that are driving the madcap antics and the increasing shrill intensities of everyone but the Dude. The plot often seems disjointed, yet in a macabre way that seems to shout that not only is truth sometimes stranger than fiction, it is sometimes absolutely insane. Yet it eventually resolves itself into a semi-rational resemblance to plausible reality, or at least almost. And one walks way from the outstanding ensemble cast's performance thinking that something magic and allegorical has happened here, and it is perhaps exactly the insanity of the proceeding activity that is the point. They are indeed, every last one of them, just California crazy! This is a wild roller coaster of a film experience, but one absolutely worth the taking. Buckle up, kids, you're in for a bumpy ride!

995873,5,6304994540,"Why do so few films develop a cult following which increases in number and intensity each year? For example, The Big Lebowski. Can you think of another film which has an annual festival in its sole honor? (It was held this year in Louisville.) I was mulling about this as I recently saw it again. Much funnier this time. For me, the same is true of Young Frankenstein. Films never change but we do. So how have I changed? If The Big Lebowski is even funnier the next time, what does that reveal about me? More mulling awaits me.
Meanwhile, given the variety of screenplays they have co-authored, produced, directed thus far, Joel and Ethan Coen cannot be accused of predictability. Who else has created a body of work as varied as theirs? Blood Simple (1985), Raising Arizona (1987), Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Fargo (1996) The Big Lebowski (1998), O, Brother, Where Art Thou? ((2000), and The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Each has its own loyal and substantial following. Fargo remains my personal favorite but, over time, as I keep changing, perhaps The Big Lebowski will replace it.
Few people know that, in fact, the Coens collaborated on its screenplay with members of the Monty Python Flying Circus, Hunter Thompson, Ken Kesey, Salvador Dali, and William M. Gaines. How else to explain the absence of a coherent plot? Fortunately, we have an especially interesting cast of characters in addition to the two Jeffrey Lebowskis (Lebowskes?): ""The Big's"" wife Bunny (Tara Reid) who creates serious problems for ""Dude"" because she owes money to Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) and is kidnapped, with a ransom of $1-million demanded; ""The Big's"" daughter Maude (Julianne Moore) who really should join a flying circus; Jesus (John Turturro), a champion bowler who prefers blue language and purple clothing; Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), probably ""Dude's"" best friend; and Donny (Steve Buscemi), another of ""Dude's"" close friends. Much time is spent on consuming White Russians as well as on bowling, kidnapping, cursing, extortion, sex, and...
For many of us, this film is an acquired taste. I enjoy it more each time I see it; others, I realize, will not see it through to completion. For them, it makes no sense. In this context, I am reminded of Henry Ford's observation that whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.",1059436800,,2383,4.96
995874,4,6304994540,"Jeff Bridges does not play the title role in ""The Big Lebowski.""  Bridges plays the Dude; David Huddleston plays the Big Lebowski, a rich guy with a young trophy wife named Bunny (Tara Reid).  The problem is that the Dude and the Big Lebowski have the same name, which explains why when Bunny runs up debts the moronic pair sent to collet money from her husband end up at the house of the wrong Lebowski.  From that moment on the Dude's life gets very confusing and he is clearly the person least capable of dealing with this confusion of anybody in the greater Los Angeles area,
""The Big Lebowski"" is only disappointing because it is the first film the Coen Brothers came out with after ""Fargo.""  When you make a masterpiece it is hard to follow-up with something equally strong.  Even ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" suffers in comparison to ""Citizen Kane,"" and whatever happened to the guy who made ""Titanic""?  However, if ""The Big Lebowski"" came out after ""Raising Arizona"" nobody would have batted an eye.  Not just because they both deal with a kidnapping that may or may not be a kidnapping, but also because the Coen Brothers have rounded up many of the usual familiar faces from their other films for this endeavor.
There are two main questions in this film.  The first is ""What is going on?""  Repeatedly the Dude sits down and explains to his friends Walter (John Goodman) and/or Donny (Steve Buscemi) what he thinks is going on, or Walter takes a stab at it, and the odds are that sooner or later they are going to get it right.  Just do not put money down on it.  The second is what, if anything, the Dude will have left at the end of this meandering story.  You get the feeling that chances are neither the Dude nor his car are going to get out of this one alive and that his friends are as much a threat to the Dude (and his car) as the growing number of enemies who keep popping up through the festivities.  If only the Dude did not own a rug that really pulled his apartment together, then he might have been spared a lot of pain and frustration.
""The Big Lebowski"" is a film that will grow on you, especially once you get atuned to the idea that the Dude is trying to keep his life together, the same way his beloved rug pulled together his apartment.  Even a misfire by the Coens is going to have some memorable moments and every film they make certainly has a chance to be on the level of ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo,"" so even their second tier efforts are worth watching.",1059350400,,2488,4.415754923413567

There's when the Coens decide to challenge the analytical part of the mind (Barton Fink, Fargo, Miller's Crossing, The Man Who Wasn't There) and there's the lighter side of the Coens (O Brother Where Art Thou, Raizing Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy).
This, my friends, is the latter.
And in my humble opinion....their funniest movie to date!
Yes, this means that I'm ranking it above O Brother (which is, according to Joel C., ""the most expensive three stooges movie ever made"").  What, you don't agree?
Okay, let me put this straight.
Well, there's The Dude.  And you may not realize it, but he is a private detective in the leanest sense of the word, pure base concept here...but make no mistake, he is a true gumshoe in the likes of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe.  Here he is, just a regular....well, dude.  Minding his own business when two hired thugs break into his apartment thinking he's the Big Lebowski (he's not, but he is named Lebowski) and relieve themselves on his rug...a rug that ""tied the whole room together.""  Now he isn't going to sit still for that, not after his good friend played by John Goodman goads him.  So he's off to see the Big Lebowski for a replacement rug, but gets caught up in a botched kidnapping and the weirdness ensues.
Here the Coens use every cliche in the old detective noir genre.  The respected politician (who is corrupt underneath his philanthropic veneer).  The local sheriff who disrespects him.  The creepy henchmen.  The seductive mistress.  The humorous sidekick.  The odd bit of tragedy.  The only things missing are fedoras and trenchcoats.
Plus, you get the Coens' hallucinogenic imagery.  The ""bowling porno"" dream sequence should be considered a moment of new Hollywood legend.  The nude abstract painting of Maude.  The euro-techno freaks and their pet ferret.

995879,4,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski (Joel Coen, 1998)
The Big Lebowski is considered, at least by the users of IMDB, to be one of the best movies of all time (as I write this, it sits at #228 on the top 250). I seem to be not as big a fan of all things Coen as most people; while I found Miller's Crossing, Fargo, and The Man Who Wasn't There brilliant pieces of moviemaking, I was one of those unfortunate souls who found Raising Arizona unwatchable. The Big Lebowski wasn't that bad, to be sure, but it wasn't the laff riot advertised by its many fans, in my opinion.
Jeff Bridges (Starman/Jagged Edge) stars as Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski, who suffers a fate common to many of us; someone mistakes him for another guy with the same name. Except it's not a credit card company or a telemarketer doing it, it's a pair of thugs trying to collect on a debt run up by Lebowski's (the other Lebowski, that is) wife (Tara Reid of Return to Salem's Lot, all grown up). In the course of roughing Lebowski (the poorer) up, one of the thugs decides that urinating on the carpet is an effective way of getting someone to pay a debt. So Lebowski (the poorer), urged on by his best friend Walter (John Goodman, in the performance of his career), decides to contact Lebowski (the richer, played by David Huddleston [The Wonder Years/Frantic]) to see if he can get a replacement rug. After all, the thugs meant to urinate on HIS rug. And it all goes downhill from there.
Almost every review of this movie points out the many fine performances in here and attributes the movie's greatness to them. Certainly, the performances are fine, but one wonders if those who have said this to be Jeff Bridges' finest work have seen Starman or Jagged Edge; those who have called this Flea's best work have ever seen Dudes or Suburbia; Steve Buscemi's, Reservoir Dogs; Julianne Moore's, Hellcab or Far from Heaven; you get the idea. These are good performances, and some (especially those of Goodman and cameo appearer John Turturro) are great, but almost everyone here has shown themselves capable of this level of work in the past as well. And as we have been given a number of examples of in the past couple of years (In the Bedroom, White Oleander, Traffic, etc.), a number of great performances are all well and good, but if they don't add up to anything do not necessarily make for a great film. Such is the case here. The visual artistry that made The Man Who Wasn't There or O Brother, Where Art Thou? such treats is notably absent here; Coen seems to have opted to make a film that was ""straight"" on its surface and all too queer underneath (a technique, it should be noted, that worked exceptionally in Fargo). When it works, it works, when it doesn't, it doesn't.

I found this film to be all of these things, as well as quite funny, but ultimately, the quirky humor couldn't quite compensate for the lack of substance in the storyline. The absurdity of the situations, the dialogue, and especially the characters and their idiosyncracies (especially Walter's inability to stop bringing up ""'Nam"") brings much to the table, but by the time Jeff ""The Dude"" Bridges fixes his seventh or eighth White Russian, it makes you wonder when something's going to happen.

995980,5,6304994540,"Don't try to read too deeply within the plotline of this movie.  Don't try to analize the characters and their relevance.  This movie was made to be just plain fun.  Jeff Bridges probably gives his best  performance since RANCHO DELUXE as The Dude an unemployed ex war demonstrator who happens to excel in the SoCal Bowling league.  Even though we never see him roll a ball.  John Goodman plays his 'friend' Walter, a war veteran who justifies his every arguement with the fact that he 'watched his buddies die face down in the muck in Vietnam!' He rails against Dude for using the term 'Chinamen' as being politically incorrect, but then goes off about the German bowling scheduler Burkholter.  Everythings a wonderful contradiction with this guy.  Throw in Walters' poor sidekick Donnie(Steve Buscemi)and you have a completeley inane bowling team of the blind leading the blind.
The storyline is The Dude gets mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski a wealthy achiever whos wife owes money to smut producer Jackey Treehorn.  From this premise we are treated to a plethora of wacky characters...Maude, the Big Lebowskis' sister known for her feministic art; the German punk band AUTOBHAN also known as the belivers of nothing who claim to have kidnapped the Big Lebowskis' wife and are sending body parts until the ransom is paid; and the scene stealing Jesus (John Torturo)a competing bowler who besides being a pederast ""can really roll man""; the above mentioned Jackey Treehorn who can mix a mean caucasion and has heard all those kidnapping stories, ""so just save it"".  He just wants the money owed to him by Mrs. Lebowski.  This leads to an encounter with the Malibu chief of police and an Eagles playing cab driver.  A 'fellow private dick' working for the Knutesens.
Add to this a narrator who shows up a time or two on camera as 'The Stranger'and you can't help but ask 'why?'.  Answer:  Don't ask.

John Goodman steals the show as a violent, overweight Vietnam veteran who can't control his anger at bowling tournaments. Julianne ""Before I was famous"" Moore plays an offkey role as an eccentric, butch haircut feminist. John Turturro plays a child molesting bowler named Jesus who even John Goodman doesn't want to get near. Jeff Bridges is bland but brilliant.
The movie meshes from scene to scene with effortless cinematography that could only be drafted from the minds of Joel and Ethan Cohen.

Overlooked and misunderstood when it was initially released back in 1998, do make sure you check it out if you are one of those who never got around to seeing it back then - you won't be sorry you did.
The DVD itself might not be the greatest out there in terms of bonus material, but considering the Coen brothers have never been big on bonus materials it could've been a lot worse as the DVD comes with a nice 30 minute interview with the Coen brothers themselves as well as main cast members. The DVD also includes a teaser trailer as well as cast and filmmaker biographies. The video quality is superb. Clean, sharp and free of any print flaws, specks, etc. it is a terrific video transfer.

996053,5,6304994540,"You wouldn't expect anything lesser from the makers of Fargo and Raising Arizona, arguably two fantastic movies in their own right. The B L is a freaky comedy without any situational plot in particular but weirdly engaging in the theme and its treatment nevertheless.
It's about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is described by the narrator as the laziest man in LA  County. He lives only to go bowling, but is mistaken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with funny consequences. The Dude is played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, a potbelly, a ponytail and a pair of Bermuda shorts so large they may have been borrowed from his best friend and bowling teammate, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Their other teammate is Donny (Steve Buscemi), who may not be very bright, but it's hard be sure since he never is allowed to complete a sentence.
Los Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he's socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.)
Some may complain The Big Lebowski rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style -- ala ""Go"" and ""Swingers"". The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings.
Definitely a light hearted allround enjoyable movie -- something that deserves more than 9 reviews at Amazon! (as of this  writing)",1047081600,,2000,4.794202898550725

In fact, my friends and I get more annoying with each viewing, quoting ""the dude"" and Walter at random, anywhere, anytime. It grows on you, and you start to realize every element is there - well developed characters (maybe not ones you would necessariy want as friends!), a familiar story that has excellent treatment, and fun dream sequences that are well executed. Guest stars are fun to spot, too!
Have a white russian, and kick back. In the parlance of our times: ""this unchecked aggression will not stand!"". (Timely words today...)",1046908800,,788,4.595744680851064

His best friend, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman in his best comic role), is a rage-prone Jewish intellectual wannabe who can't get over his Vietnam days.  Steve Buscemi plays The Dude's other friend, Donny, who can't get a word in edgewise because Walter constantly rebukes him (SHUT THE ... UP, DONNY!!!)

996123,5,6304994540,"The Coen's make it look easy. After seeing one of their films, you think to yourself: ""why didn't I think of that?"" It's brilliant how they do that, their grace and style is beyond belief and though their message can be foggy at times, it shows they're two of the most talented faces in the American movie industry.
Their new film, The Big Lebowski isn't as much a departure as a new angle. It feels different, looks different, sounds different (voicing 256 uses of the ""f"" word in 118 minutes), but in the end you know that it's a Coen movie. Not because it's weird, not because it's clever, but because it works, it's a movie perfectly sequentially pieced together, like no other.
Jeff Bridges plays Los Angeles slacker ""The Dude"", an inner-league bowler who's teammates (John Goodman as Walter and Steve Buscemi as Donny) are his best friends. After two small-time thugs urinate on his favorite rug that ""tied the room together"" after mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski (Dude's given name), a millionaire who's younger wife owes their mafia money, he decides to take it up with that same millionaire. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Lebowski's assistant (and somewhat manservant) who stands by The Dude while waiting for Lebowski in one of the most achingly funny scenes of the decade. He meets with him, in a bad conversation, in which The Dude walks out with one of Lebowski's rugs that he steals. Lebowski calls on The Dude again when his wife Bunny is kidnapped for ransom money and Dude is the only guy who can sit in as the bagman.
From there on it's a classic twisted Coen plot, with appearances by Julianne Moore, John Turturro and Peter Stormare. It goes off the charts, something that we should expect from every Coen plot but every time the film gets us so caught up in the story that we're still surprised at every risky weirdo plot twist.
Joel and Ethan write one of the best scripts of the year, helped tremendously by a perfectly cast repertoire of great actors and actresses. Roger Deakins cinematography doesn't hurt the overall package and editing by Roderick Jaynes, ha ha (really the Coen's) puts the finishing touched on an already excellent film. It's respectable raunch that doesn't feel guilty for being what it should be...hilarious. The Coen's live up to their expectations with yet another mind-blowing masterpiece.",1045612800,,2355,4.8316831683168315
996124,5,6304994540,"Before anything is really said, you must know that this comedy is not like anything you'll ever see.  You may find movies with a slap-stick slacker style, but none like ""The Big Lebowski"".  The movie stars Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude'; or of a more formal nature, Jeff Lebowski.  Alongside The Dude there is the always funny John Goodman.  Goodman plays the part of Walter Sobchak, who is The Dude's best friend and bowling partner.  And what makes the duo so hilarious is how their sometimes subtle humor flows throughout the entire movie.  Part of that humor may be the fact that neither Goodman or Bridges go two minutes without using the F word.  It's 'F-this' and 'F-that' and you just get used to it.
What really gets the movie going is when a China-man (or an Asian American, which is the preferred nomenclature) relieves himself on The Dude's rug.  He them comes to find that the China-man was actually looking for was a different Jeff Lebowski, who becomes known as 'The Big Lebowski'.  The Dude then persists on getting his rug back and pays TBL a visit.  He says no and the movie seems to be at a standstill.  But then TBL's wife (played by ""American Pie"" star Tara Reid) is kidnapped and the whole movie takes off in different directions.  But I'm not going to ruin any more of it for you; you'll have to see it for yourself.
The Coen Brothers, who've helped make movies like ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"" become what they are, give us something new to laugh it.  And it includes the star of ""Fargo"" Steve Buscemi (who is the third member of the bowling team), as well as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro.  There's also an awesome appearance by Sam Elliott who introduces (by voice) and concludes (in person) the film as the infamous 'Stranger'.  His character really adds the movie's excellence.
All in all, this movie is just a great piece of work.  It ranks #10 on my list of favorite movies, if that says anything--and it should.  There's no way you can hold back the laughter; and if you're able to you must be mute.  As I said it is a different sort of twist on comedy, but then so was ""Fargo"".  And if you liked ""Fargo"", then you'll love this one.  The cast is terrific and it is without a doubt the best performance I've ever seen Jeff Bridges play.  So if you're lazy, or even if you're not, make sure you see this movie.  You'll truely appreciate it, I'm sure.",1044748800,,2405,4.493087557603687

It is refreshing each time I watch it. I watch a lot of movies and there are copious amounts of them that fall into formulas for whatever genre they may belong to, but this film is a breath of fresh air from all those movies. Don't get me wrong, I love those movies also, but I find it necessary to own a movie that allows you to take a step out of the circle from time to time.

996127,5,6304994540,"The Coen brothers have a knack for taking a genre and turning it in upon itself. In The Big Lebowski they present 'The Dude' in a fantastic performance of a guy in love with white russians (milk and kaluah) and bowling. His adventures are that of a stoner Ramond Chandler with a truly great and over the top performance by John Goodman as his buddy/partner.
The dream sequences are funny, scenes in the film that don't initally make sense are funny. You might not even understand what's going on but there's a light surreal air that makes everything sensible.
This is a great choice for the DVD format as seeing this movie several times reveals more with each viewing. The plot hangs by threads but the situations The Dude experiences and more importantly the way he reacts make for some fantastic comedy.
If you need linear stories this might not be your cup of tea but if you enjoy the feel of a film, it's look and overall attitude you'll enjoy The Big Lebowski.
The interview segment of the DVD is excellent as the Coen brothers explain how the film develops and what they were trying to accomplish. But do yourself a favor, watch it a couple of times before playing the interview. See if you got what they were after.
The other thing that's great about this film are the number of memorable lines and absurdist situations. The film looks gorgeous and the plot does make sense in it's own little world's set of logic.

Then we have Jesus Quintana, a convicted pedophile and bowling rival whose brief but brilliant presence in the film testifies not only to how ingenious the Coen brothers are but how excellent of an actor John Tuturro is (he has a screen time of about 3 minutes yet is one of the most memorable characters).

The Dude is a dysfunctional and reluctant hero who is enlisted to solve the mysterious kidnapping of Bonnie, the wife of the eponymous ""big"" Jeffrey Lebowski (as played by David Huddleston) with whom he shares the exact same name.  This trial interferes with his normal regimen of league bowling and institutional slacking around greater Los Angeles.
  With the support of his inflammatory and chronic sociopath friend (Walter) the Dude enters a meandering and hopelessly complex mystery (in the vein of Raymond Chandler--according to the Cohens) which ultimately proves insignificant.  The tone, soundtrack and mood of this movie blend into a polished comic masterpiece.  This movie has entered the public lexicon and is frequently quoted among devotees.

I won't even try to describe the plot, because its really not that important.  The movie is about a couple of incredibly funny characters brought to life by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, and their love/hate relationship.  ""The Dude"", played by Jeff Bridges rides an emotional rollercoaster of events, all brought about by a thug urinating on his rug in a case of mistaken identity.  Egged on by his friend Walter (John Goodman) the Dude tries to recover his rug, and becomes caught up in the middle of plot which is almost impossible to follow - but somehow that just doesn't matter.
This movie is full of good laughs of all kinds from start to finish.  The dialog, subtle gags, and ironic turns of events will have fans rolling (am I wrong?).
Bridges and Goodman are PERFECT in their respective roles.  Watching the Dude's facial expressions alone is worth the cost of the movie, but it really offers so much more.  If you're one of the people who love it, you'll want to watch it over and over.

Still, who can resist a bunch of bowlers who speak in the vocabulary of college professors?

996219,4,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski provides further proof (as if it was needed) that the Cohen's are masters of film design and execution. Case in point: the script. At one point, The Dude, completely smashed, comments that ""Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women""-a line that can use multiple going-overs. Other scenes feature a marmot in a bathtub, cameras used in the wholes of a bowling ball, a malfunctioning submachine gun, and no end of vehicular damage.
The camera work is equally impressive. From the ""Gutter Balls"" dream sequence to the introduction of Jesus, the sex offender, a wistful, surreal quality permeates the film-especially when combined with the music. The gothic chanting and the Latin dance tune both fit their respective scene perfectly.
The plot is simple, revolving around The Dude, a bowler whose current major problem is that the rug that tied the room together has been despoiled, and he wants to get it replaced. It's simplicity is effective; it works well.
However, it does have one fault. The end of the film sort of leaves many plot threads lying there. The entire film was filled with people asking what had happened to the money, and yet the end of the film makes us wonder the same thing-it's never really established.
But that's the only problem. Bottom line: If you're looking for something serious, in Fargo's vein, this isn't quite what you need.

996220,5,6304994540,"The Dude abides, my friends, and aren't you glad he's out there?

What a mystery today would look like if Raymond Chandler was writing on Orange Sunshine.  Following on their acclaimed hit, Fargo, the Coens, known for strange and offbeat films, on this outing went totally surreally weird.  I confess I overlooked this film initially, despite being a Coen fan, but now I absolutely love it in all its idiosyncratic nuttiness.  Worthy of multiple viewings just to savor the throwaway lines and the marvelously bizarre cameos by the Coen's repertory company (Buscemi, Turturro, Polito, Stormare etc.) and the drop-ins (Huddleston, Tara Reid, Gazzara, Moore & a wonderful Sam Elliott).

The plot, if you think one is necessary, has to do with The Dude (Jeff Bridges), an unreconstructed 60's throwback named Jeff Lebowski, being mistaken for a different, much richer Lebowski, and after being assaulted, his rug micturated upon and stolen (it ties the rooms together, man), begins a labyrinthine pursuit of the kidnapped wife of the Big Lebowski. Which of course, has nothing to do with the pleasures of this picture, which are the sidetrips and the characters, the asides, and the stuff thrown in just because its funny!

Jeff Bridges is perfect as The Dude.  He knows this guy and he is this guy.  The perfect foil to The Dude is John Goodman's Walter, a Viet Nam vet who's a seething mix of outward calm combined with an explosive temper and a penchant for wrong assumptions.  These guys are great together.

Anyway, delineation and explanation is just plain silly for this movie.  Just hop on and enjoy the ride and revel in the fact that the kitchen sink will come flying through at any moment.  There is a complete logic to this kaleidescope, but who cares?  Stay out of Malibu, Dude!  And don't forget to go find a cash machine!",1036195200,,1832,4.84887459807074

996337,5,6304994540,"Enter The Big Lebowski, a completely ridiculous and off-the-wall film that does wonders getting me out of my depression phases. Starring Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowksi and John Goodman as Walter the Vietnam veteran, it's one of those movies that doesn't have any 'cry laughing' scenes, but instead goes for a steady diet of chuckle-type humor. You won't be rolling around laughing for hours after a joke, you'll usually have to think about it for a second and then chuckle when you get it. Call me a tool, but I much prefer it when you have to think about a joke, as opposed to it being placed right in your lap.
From what I've heard, The Big Lebowski was a box-office [hit], although I can't even really recall when it would have been in theatres. Of course, every once in awhile, a movie bombs, even when it shouldn't. I'm hard-pressed for an example right now, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
The story is completely inane and ridiculous - great stuff for a good comedy. Jeffrey Lebowski - or 'The Dude' as most people call him - comes home from doing his grocery shopping only to discover that a couple of thugs have broken into his house claiming that Lebowski owes them some cash. They trash the house, dunk The Dude's head into the toilet bowl, and one of the thugs even makes the unfortunate mistake of urinating on The Dude's rug - the rug that really tied the room together. Big mistake.
After a discussion with his bowling buds, he searches out and finds the other Lebowski in town (who just happens to be a wheelchair-bound multi-millionaire), an argument ensues between the two, and The Dude leaves, a stolen carpet in hand. From there, the movie just gets even wackier. The millionaire Lebowski's 19-year-old wife Bunny is kidnapped, and The Dude is enlisted to get her back by delivering ransom money to the kidnappers.
All the while, he manages to not miss his bowling night or his frequent LSD flashbacks. The dialogue between the Dude and his bowling buddies (Goodman as Walter and Steve Buscemi as Donny) is some of the funniest in the film, and these scenes help to tie the story together so that it makes some semblance of sense. They even feature a pedophile bowler that goes by the name of 'The Jesus.' Uproarious stuff. Walter switches the briefcase with the million dollars with a briefcase filled with his own underwear. Unfortunately, after delivering the fake briefcase, The Dude's car, and the million dollars still in it, get stolen.
This leads into even more creative dialogue scenes - the conversation between the police and The Dude as he reports the car missing is particularly funny, as are his conversations with Lebowski's daughter,the president of a multi-million dollar porn empire, and a group of German nihilists (watch for Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing the third German nihilist). And The Dude even ends up getting laid! Just try to tell me that his movie doesn't have everything!
The entire film is told from the eyes of 'The Stranger,' a man that The Dude meets twice while bowling - a beer-drinking cowboy.
The cinematography is excellent - the use of varying camera angles helps to convey certain feelings. There's even a shot from a camera within a spinning bowling ball. The Dude's LSD flashback scenes were particularly well thought out - colourful and featuring well-chosen background music.
If you're looking for some absolutely hilarious slapstick, gross-out humour, I can gaurantee that you won't find it here. But if you're looking for a comedy film that relies heavily on comedic, intelligent dialogue and visuals, then The Big Lebowski is a keeper for you. Check it out, but make sure you watch it more than once. Otherwise you might just be left scratching your head.",1026864000,,3750,4.770769230769231
996338,5,6304994540,"I have never been a huge fan of the Coen brothers' work. I liked ""Raising Arizona"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", but I felt that the scripts were lacking. However, I thought that their unique, genre-fitting direction could make a great script into a fabulous movie. The Big Lebowski proved me right.
The plot involves a stoner named Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski who gets involved with a kidnapping scheme involving handicapped millionaires, German Nihilists, gen-x artists, porno producers, and a 15-year old brat with bad grades. Along for the ride is his Vietnam vet-friend, Walter, who is pretty much Rambo without intelligence, and their bowling buddy Donny, who is the most true to life characters in a long time.
The performances are brilliant. Jeff Bridges, the least likely person to play the Dude, makes him a sympathetic stoner who just wants to smoke Thai sticks and bowl. John Goodman is never afraid of overplaying his role, and it pays off with the funniest representation of a 'Nam vet ever. Philip Seymore Hoffman does so much with his small role, you won't believe he is credited in a ""3 at a time"". Steve Buscemi as Donny has few lines, but is present for the majority of the film. That is like many real friends, who say something once in a while, but end up just being there. Juliane Moore's character represents everything that the Dude doesn't like about people nowadays, a weird artist who is so complicated that talking to her is like reading 20 books at a time. She plays this role with ease and leaves a great impression. Flea and Peter Stormare join the ride as the German Nihilists and Tara Reid does her best job as an ex-porno star now married to a millionaire. And John Turturro deserves special acclaim for his brilliant, uncredited role as Jesus Quintana. This is the kind of performance that can make, ""Don't F**k with the Jesus!"" a catchphrase.
Joel Coen's direction really pairs with the brilliant dialogue in the film. He really shines in one dialogueless dream sequence in which the Dude imagines he's in a porno with Julianne Moore's character. He dances, teaches her how to bowl, rolls along the lanes as a bowling ball, all set to Kenny Roger's ""Just Dropped In"". The movie is well paced, but has the same problem which plagues all the Coen brothers' films: the 2nd act is FAR too long. Too many scenes that shouldn't have made it into the final cut come up and bore the audience. However, even those scenes have enough excellent dialogue and direction to make a book on.
If you have seen any other Coen clan film, see this immediately. Not only is this my favorite of their films, but it is my favorite film of 1998. It is funny, sweet, and most of all, quirky. VAZ Zahedi, over and Out.",1026777600,,2727,4.648033126293996

As usual, the Coen Brothers are showing off their ability to create extremely strange characters, along with their signature blend of fantasy and reality, and nifty camera work. However, the plot is not all that coherent, and the characters, for all their oddity, are not that compelling. Jeff Bridges plays a burned out hippie leftover(""the Dude"") who, by way of having the same name as a millionaire, gets himself involved in one misunderstanding after another regarding the disappearance of the millionaire's wife. However, John Goodman steals the show as his bowling partner, a Vietnam vet with a hair trigger temper and a knack for springing into military style action when the Dude's passivity allows him. Together, they screw up one thing after another in trying to disentangle the Dude with the circumstances. What I imagine the Coen Brothers were trying to achieve here was to make the Dude into  some sort of modern Zen/Tao master/independent maverick who, by virtue of his ignorance and willingness to just let things happen to him, ekes himself out of intrigue. My belief that this is the aim of the movie is supported by Sam Elliot's narration of the story in a cowboy hat, attempting to assign some importance to the Dude's actions and style. It doesn't really all come together, really, 'cause theres nothing good about being ""a dude"", no matter what prism you filter him thru.
I'm no prude. But the f-word is bandied about so many times in this movie you get tired of hearing it. It was funny when the Soth Park kids did it, but here it grates. I imagine alot of people are going to think this is a great movie because of that and the lead character's casual and frequent pot use, and I suspect that those who thought this was one of the greatest movies theyve ever seen must have the same smoking habits as the Dude.",1026000000,,1970,4.743440233236152

996402,5,6304994540,"At his moment in the history of American film, I wonder if the Coen brothers aren't our most interesting filmmakers. Even their misses are more interesting than most other's hits. Of all their films, I personally believe that THE BIG LEBOWSKI is the finest film they have made yet.
If in MADAME BOVARY Flaubert attempted (and succeeded) at writing a novel without a heroine, in THE BIG LEBOWSKI the Coen brothers made a film without a hero. Jeff Bridges plays the title role of Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski, who isn't so much everyday as considerably below nondescript. He is poor, unambitious, unobtrusive, and unspectacular. His only goals in life appear to be bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. That ""The Dude"" could be the center of a motion picture seems spectacularly absurd. That the movie succeeds despite such humble assumptions is a testament both to the Coen brothers and Jeff Bridges. I have long considered Bridges to be one of the most underrated performers in the movies today. Interestingly, it may be the movie in which he was most playing himself. I saw a segment of BIOGRAPHY on A&E on Jeff Bridges, and his wife mentioned that in this film he was pretty much playing himself, and, in fact, wore the clothes he wears in everyday life in much of it. Gotta love that.
On one level, this movie is absurd. Intentionally absurd.  The various elements, in the hands of lesser individuals than the Coen brothers, might fall apart into something dumb. Instead, they meld it into something remarkable. John Goodman's diatribes about the boys in Vietnam, or his dedication to the Jewish Sabbath (despite not being Jewish), or the many jokes about Nihilists, or Goodman's awe at being in the semi-presence (the man is unconsicious and in an iron lung) of a man who wrote most of the episodes of the TV show BRANDED, or John Turturro's absolutely demented turn as a Hispanic bowler, or Philip Seymour Hoffman's marvelous turn as the personal assitant to multi-millionaire Jeff Lebowski, or Sam Elliot as the seemingly omniscient ""The Stranger"" all are elements that improbably blend together to make an absolute masterpiece. Bizarrely, the more absurd the Coen Bros become, the better the film becomes.
The cast is as good as one can possibly imagine. Jeff Bridges, has I mentioned, is just perfect in the lead. John Goodman and Steve Buscemsi are just as good as his bowling partners/best friends. Goodman's frequent blow-ups are among the best moments in the movie. Tara Reid has gone on to larger roles since this film, but she has never been better than in the small but crucial role of Bunny Lebowski. Peter Stormare (notable before this as the more insane of the two murderers in FARGO, the one Frances MacDormand catches trying to put the leg of Steve Buscemi into a pulping machine) is just incredible as the leader of the ""Nihilists."" Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Ben Gazzara, and Juliane Moore all make a good movie even better. And Flea, of the Chilli Peppers, makes a small appearance as one of the Nihilists.
This is just a great film. It isn't just a must see, but a must see over and over. Few films of recent years have so many moments that I enjoy recalling as this one. And although OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU! and THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, the two films that have followed THE BIG LEBOWSKI, haven't been quite up to its level, I still look forward to a new Coen brothers film more than just about any other.
One other note. The music for this film is just incredible. One of the most striking moments occurs when the viewer is assaulted with a brutal version in Spanish of ""Hotel California."" It is worth noting that the person responsible for assembling the songs for the sound track was none other than T-Bone Burnett. Although O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? was not a great movie, it did feature a spectacular soundtrack. T-Bone Burnett was responsible for the music of both films.",1025740800,,3928,4.767988252569751
996403,5,6304994540,"This is my most favorite film of all times. Even the good all russian movies, most of which I watch and like, can't beat this one.

When I first watched it, I was kinda shocked by the language they used (I wasn't used to that), but despite that I was laughing hard throughout the whole movie.
Now there are a couple of things you gotta understand about this movie. First of all, the cursing in this movie is on purpose, it's not because the makers of this film just decided that everyone should curse. That's just who they are and how they talk. Second, don't take it very seriously. The whole feeling of the movie dissappears if you take it seriously. Like somebody here said the movie has a paper-thin plot.

Just as many others, I didn't even come close to fully appreciating this movie the first time I watched it.  After Fargo, a movie with so much plot and structure it smacks you across the face, this just seemed disjointed and confused.  There were still overtly funny parts, and I definitely enjoyed it, but it's when you start catching the subtleties that it blows your mind and interpolates itself into your daily speech.
The Coens add such a HUMAN element to this movie...their use of sentence fragments, incoherent thoughts, and completely disjointed conversations (especially the bowling alley scenes) is unbelievable.  The thing that really makes the flick to me is that almost every line in the latter half of the movie has a predecessor...in other words a character will say something early in the movie, then you'll hear someone else (usually the DUDE) use the same phrase in completely the wrong context - chinaman, beaver, ""the parlance of our times"", ""this agression will not stand"", ""my concern is"", Ralph's grocery store - all of these phrase are tossed out early and completely botched later in the movie.  If that doesn't strike you as something that would be funny, then you might not like this movie.  But if you do appreciate stuff like that, upon repeated viewings this movie will most likely change from a bunch of over-the-top stupidity to one of the most tight-knit, layered movies I've ever seen, especially for a comedy!!  I still figure things out EVERY time I watch it.
(For example, upon last viewing I realized that there is ""German techno-pop"" playing in the background when we see the ""nihilists"" for the last time - brilliant!!!)
Basically, if you are someone who considers the dialogue of a movie to be a vital ingredient to your enjoyment, then you'll most likely LOVE this movie to the point of fanaticism.

I gave it to a friend on his 49th birthday. At a family gathering to celebrate, he mentioned he'd received The Big Lebowski as a gift. His nephew, 22, started bubbling: ""Oh man, oh man, The Big Lebowski is the greatest movie ever made! It's the greatest movie in history! Oh man, I watch it ever week, it's the best movie I've ever seen!!"" and so on.
My friend's little 70-something mother said, ""Oh, good -- let's watch it after we finish eating!""

996845,5,6304994540,"The Coens brothers are not that prolific. I'd estimate that the combined income from all their projects is less than 10% of what ""Titanic"" made.
Nonetheless, one of their productions, ""Fargo"", made the AFI's Top 100 list. What's more impressive is that voters on the far more democratic Internet Movie DataBase put 4 of their 7 films on the site's Top 250 list.
""The Big Lebowski"" is one of those four movies. It has the definitive Coen signature, which can be described as the ability to show how ordinary people accidentally find themselves in extraordinary situations. These are usually criminal in nature.
In ""Blood Simple"", there was a dead body that wouldn't stay buried. Unable to have children of their own, a couple - a cop and an ex-con - found a solution when a rich couple had sextuplets in ""Raising Arizona"". They figured that, if they kidnapped one of the infants, no one would miss it. Frances McDormand, who is Mrs. Joel Coen in real life, stole the show in ""Fargo"". She played a Minnesota policewoman investigating one of the dumbest crimes ever committed.
""The Big Lebowski"" is an enormously funny story about mistaken identity, a kidnapping and a missing rug.
Jeff Bridges, who's had a very up and down career, gives his best performance since 1993's ""Fearless"", a highly recommended film.
Bridges' character refuses to answer to his last name, Lebowski. Irrevocably stuck in the 70's, he insists on being called The Dude. About the only things he does well are bowling and smoking illegal substances.
His best friend, Walter, is trapped in an even worse time frame. He thinks he's still in Vietnam. As Walter, John Goodman gives what is arguably his best screen performance.
The real fun begins when Russian thugs burst into The Dude's apartment. Taking a bath in a candle lit bathroom and listening to groovy 70's tunes, our stoned hero doesn't get really mad until the intruders ruin his favorite rug.
These villains demand that The Dude's wife repay a lot of money she owes. This presents a problem because The Dude isn't married. Said wife, aptly named Bunny, is married to someone else - The Big Lebowski [David Huddleson], a creepy old man whose daughter Maude is older than Bunny.
Maude also becomes a problem. She has her own thugs, despises her father and is convinced Bunny kidnapped herself. As Maude, Julieanne Moore is even better than she was in ""Boogie Nights"". She also gets to make one of the most memorable entrances in the history of motion pictures.
By now you are perhaps thinking that this movie is wacky. If so, you are not only right, but that's just the beginning of the picture.
The brothers Coen are relentless inventive and outrageous. In ""The Big Lebowski"", they even find a way to scold themselves for the profanity that is rampant throughout the movie. Even the foul language seems more satirical than prurient.
Joel and Ethan seem to live happily in their own dimension. Personally, I enjoy their distorted view of reality. Or is it really distorted? You decide.",1017273600,,3014,4.8317214700193425

I've seen this movie many times now and I still love it.  It is everything Fargo wasn't! Remember: The bums will always lose.",1016668800,,413,4.8428571428571425
997366,5,6304994540,"I first saw ""The Big Lebowski"" when it was in the theatres.  Being a die-hard Coens fan, I was ready for inconsequential lunacy, esoteric characterizations, and dangerous obsessions with style and substance.  Which is what I got.  Still, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed.  Having revisited ""Lebowski"" recently, I now understand why.  Ill prepared to deal with the rambling narrative, I felt cheated by lack of structure.  Which, I now see, is precisely the point of the film.  So, my advice to first time viewers of ""The Big Lebowski"": never mind the plot machinations, this one's all about watching (and listening to [and learning from]) The Dude.
Remember that stoner guy in high school, the one with the flashes of wit and insight in between spaced-out ramblings about his favourite rock band?  Well, then you are on your way to knowing Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski.  Mistaken by collecting thugs for a richer, more married, other Jeffrey Lebowski, The Dude gets caught up in a kidnapping caper when all he really wants to do is bowl and own a urine-free rug that really holds the room together.  His dialogue belies years of smoking jay and downing endless White Russians.  But The Dude is no Spicoli retread, and he'd never be caught dead with Bill and Ted.  Surprisingly, he's a man of substance.
His history, missed by me the first time around, plays a terribly important role in his character.  There's the scene where he's in bed with Maude Lebowski (daughter of The Big Lebowski), where she point blank asks him about his past.  Obscure references are made to the Port Huron Statement and the Seattle Seven, which indicates a fair measure of radicalism in Jeff's student days.  But he also casually tells Brandt (The Big Lebowski's manservant) that his university days were spent, ""occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick [and] breaking into the ROTC"".  So a social conscience was never far from young Jeff's thoughts.  But now, some two decades later, he's burned out.  It's the yearning for the casual lifestyle, free from stress and, quite frankly, thought, that is the main theme at the core of the movie.
Standing in The Dude's way are a series of supporting characters that make up a Raymond Chandleresque menagerie of society's oddest oddballs (a group of nihilists with a defined sense of fairness; a trust-fund performance artist; an old-school pornographer; a bowling child molester; a seemingly endless parade of carpet pissers).  But they are less characters than roadblocks to The Dude's ultimate goal: a life of leisure.
Jeff Bridges, so adept at playing tormented angst (""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", ""The Fisher King""), proves that he has a deft comic touch, without ever being light.  His Dude is a scruffy sloth, impatient with the world around him, but unable to figure out a viable way out of it.  Bridges is truly hilarious here, never more so than with a simple expression near the end, when one character literally gets in his face.  Assisting Bridges on his quest for leisure nirvana are John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.  Goodman's Walter Sobchak is, if possible, even more over the top than The Dude.  A conspiracy minded Vietnam vet, Sobchak is the raving id to The Dude's laid-back id, which makes them fast friends, and a terrible team.  Buscemi, in what may be the most thankless role in the entire Coen canon, brings enough humanity to the eternally dim Donny that he becomes less a cipher and more an important friend.  The rest of the cast is a fine mixture of Coen regulars, recognizable character actors, and even a couple of my favourite musicians in small cameos (look closely for Flea and Aimee Mann as two of the Nihilists).
But it's probably Sam Elliott who makes the most undeniable impression here, as a smooth talking cowboy enigmatically called ""The Stranger"".  His thick southern drawl, bushy moustache, and constantly twinkling eyes brighten up the few brief scenes he's in.  Ostensibly the narrator (and who else but the Coens could dream up a narrator who loses his train of thought?), Elliott appears once at the beginning, once in the middle, and once again at the end.  He offers low-key charm for The Dude to play off of (one of my favourite jokes in the film:
THE STRANGER: One of those days, huh?  Well, a wiser fellow than myself once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, well, he eats you.
DUDE:  Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?  [Mike's note:  Oh yeah!  The whole Eastern philosophy thing is a great, subtle undercurrent throughout the film.  The Dude abides, indeed.  Catch him doing faux Tai Chi when he needs to mellow out more than the marijuana can handle.]
THE STRANGER:  Far from it.).
Ultimately, I suppose, ""Lebowski"" is a product of the Coen Brothers' minds, and its laced with their particular obsessions, stylistic devices, and eclectic musical choices (imagine scoring a tense bowling moment with a flamenco version of ""Hotel California"").  If you've enjoyed the Coens' anti-filmmaking in the past, and are prepared for an even more extreme example of it, take a quick trip with The Dude and Co.  You'll surely enjoy the ride.
(The DVD doesn't have much in the way of features, except for a nifty 30-minute interview with Joel and Ethan Coen.  It's a rare treat, offering a trip into the brothers' witty, eccentric, but thoughtful filmmaking minds.  Their anecdote about an interview they gave to a magazine called ""Floor Coverings Weekly"" is priceless, and it shows their playfulness and willingness to mock anyone not in on the joke.)",1015718400,,5576,4.907150480256137

997369,5,6304994540,"Although it has been commented on in an earlier review, when The Dude makes out his check at the Ralphs (for .69 cents) it takes on newly bizarre signifigance.  Ten years to the day of the 911, The Dude makes his check out on September 11, 1991 as the television shows Bush Sr. sabre rattling prior to Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  Much like the final shot of ""Barton Fink"" (the pelican diving *kerplunkt!* right into the ocean as the dollface on the beach raises her hand to shade her eyes), it's a bit of cinematic effluvia that captures perfectly the Coen's overall sensibility (call it quirky, but that barely scratches the surface.
Aside from the faux Philip Marlow stylings (reminiscent of Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" in my opinion), the film's father/son dynamic (the Big Lebowski/The Dude) is a kind of riff on ""Rebel Without a Cause.""  The classic scene between the the two Jeffrey Lebowski's: Jeff Bridges and David Huddleston, as the Dude tries to explain the situation with the rug is a pitched battle between father and son, between the generations that plays like the world's most generic scolding, the place where father and son diverge and find each other lacking in the way they live their respective lives.
The films of the Coen's don't always get noticed for the sublety of certain scenes or shots... they still have that aura of the film school brat.  But the simple, unnoticed callbacks like the the Dude's choice in bank checks: whale prints.  This image is called back later in the film on the soundtrack as whale songs play through The Dude's cheapo tape player while he gets pleasantly stoned in the candlelit tub.  Pretty sweet, hardly noticed (unlike the frequent callback of the various names for  genitalia)... thank you DVD!
This is an incredibly complex film once you get past the pot smoke and mirrors the Coens like to throw up to obscure their literary source material and the cinematic homages that play throughout.  Pretty damn cool... Totally worth owning on DVD...

First of all I would like to think not that it has a paper-thin plot, but that it finds complexity in simplicity.  For intellectually inept characters like ""The Dude"", Walter, and Donnie, this see through fiasco with an obvious forgone conclusion leads to an epic adventure, because they can't see the answers in front of their faces.  As a result we get to meet hilarious characters such as Jackie Treehorn, The ""other"" Jeff Lebowski, The German Nihilist Gang (including Pornstar ""Karl Hungus""), John Polito's P.I. character and the young car thief, as well as characters from our protagonists' personal lives such as ""The Dude's"" land lord and John Tuturro's hilarious Jesus from ""The Dude's"" bowling league.  Also the narration by Sam Elliot as ""The Stranger"" is as funny as it is odd.  My opinion is that this character represents the ""old"" California, before people like ""The Dude"" and the other characters in this film overran it.

997427,5,6304994540,"Ostensibly ""The Big Lebowski"" is a farce, a hodgepodge of film noir, westerns and mistakened identity. And yet if one looks beyond the surface of expletives and grandiose set pieces -- which only repeated viewings of the film can yield -- one will find a film which delves deeper into issues of masculinity such as sports, virility, war and redemption; subjects which just about every critic overlooked when stating the obvious in their review of the film.
As the Stranger states during the beginning of the movie the Dude is ""a man for his time and his place;"" a product of the '60's who meanders through the early 90's, a time in which many men in the U.S. seemed to be vicariously reasserting their manliness through the Gulf War . The Gulf War informs many events in the movie from the Dude's belittlement at the hands of the Big Lebowski (""This aggression will not stand .  .  .man!"") to Walter Sobchak's thoughts about ""Charlie"" and the possible outcome of the then impending conflict in the Persian Gulf.
The film is a literal deconstruction of everything that is normally associated with masculinity. From the outset, the Dude , like so many real and fictional heros before him, tries to right a perceived wrong. He wants recompense for his solied rug. And yet he fails miserably at this task with only a bruised jaw, a dead friend and a spurious newborn  to show for it.

In a sense the Dude's loss of virlity speaks about the rest of the Male characters in the film: the millionaire Korean War veteran who has lost his legs, the Vietnam veteran who has lost his mind, and the German nihilists who lose their hold of their philosophy when one states that the outcome of their ransom scheme  isn't fair. Even the more macho characters,  Jesus and the Malibu Police Chief, try to assert their masculinity and yet still appear emasculated in some way. The scene of Jesus and his bowling partner earnestly polishing off their bowling balls undercuts Jesus taunts of violating Walter and the Dude in a blatantly sexual manner during their upcoming bowling match. And although the Malibu Police Chief tows a hard line when it comes to protecting his beachfront community he cannot be taken seriously when showing a little leg with his knee length khaki shorts.
Ironically, the only character who asserts their masclinity without diastrous results is Maude Lebowski, the female lead, played with deadpan comic delivery by Julianne Moore. She finds her stolen rug and in the process a suitable sperm donor in the form of the Dude. Unlike the Dude,  she sees what she wants and gets it. However as evidenced with the many props and works of art which decorate her loft, most notably, a bloodied, dismembered female mannequin and a large still life of scissors,  it is implied that Maude might have lost some of her femininity in her quest to assert herself.
Ultimately, ""the Big Lebowski"" deals with the question that the Real Jeff Lebowski poses to the Dude: ""What makes a man?""  Is it a pair of testicles as the Dude so blithely states or is it something more such as a  24K ring for a 300 game, a notche on the bedpost for a romp in the hay or some repayment for a soiled rug.
The Coen Brothers don't provide any defintive answers. One can harken to the fact that the creators don't please the audience with a trite cathartic climax as the unseen and much ballyhoed match between Jesus and the Dude might have served. Instead they let the enigmatic Stranger have the last word about ""the Human Comedy"" which trails off before letting the audience in on what it all means.  As is, ""The Big Lebowski"" literally  gets the ball rolling in thinking about the question of what is means to be an American Male at the dawn of the 21st Century.",1008374400,,3738,4.6469696969696965

I rented it, then bought it after a few rentals.  Every time I watch the movie, I catch a line or two I hadn't before that makes me lose it.  From:

997510,2,6304994540,"""The Big Lebowski"" is about characters whose identities are just facades for little-boy bickering. Or perhaps I completely misinterpreted the message and gave this movie two stars for no reason.
I watched ""The Big Lebowski"" on the sole basis of Roger Ebert's review, because the phrase ""that rug really tied the room together"" brought a smile to my face. ""The Dude,"" the main character, really does say the line - in every scene starting with the very first. The line becomes a running gag throughout the movie, generously peppered with ""f***"" and its various inflections. That also might have been funny, had the filmmakers focused on the fact that profanity was the only way the vocabulary-challenged characters could lend weight to their words. But no. The film simply goes on, effortlessly and without engaging the audience, until it is finally over and the viewer begins wondering what exactly he just saw and why.
The plot is really just an excuse for the numerous character vignettes: in the first scene, ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Bridges) is introduced. He is mistaken by the local pornographer's thugs for the Millionaire Lebowki, whose wife apparently owes money around town. The thugs beat the Dude up and urinate on his rug, and therein lies the Dude's motivation to stay in the movie. The Dude is a fairly good character, lazy, and unperturbed, yet practical, but the film does so little with him that he quickly becomes an eyesore.
In the followin scenes, the Dude's bowling buddies, Walter and Danny (Buscemi), are introduced. Danny is a cipher, short and simple. Walter (Goodman) tries to take control of every situation by the virtue of his powerful lungs. He also curses a lot. Danny later dies of a heart attack, so that the wind can later blow his cremated remains in the Dude's face.
The Dude visits the real Lebowski, a wheelchair-bound millionaire who thinks too much of himself, and steals one of his rugs. We learn that Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunny, has been kidnapped, and the Dude is in charge of delivering the ransom. Soon, thanks to Walter's meddling, the two end up without the money and with everyone after them.
Strangest of all, I left with the impression that this film is fertile ground for a message. Any sort of message. ""The Big Lebowski"" has all the right ingredients, all it really needs is some seeds of commentary, cynicism, comedy, sarcasm, anything, really, and it would be a fantastic film. As it is, it dies on the screen. I literally evaluated every scene to see whether there was anything in it worth laughing at. I doubt I fulfilled my mental quota (though, in any case, the very fact that the movie generates such an attitude is hardly a compliment).
There are two good scenes in the movie, however, both dreram sequences: in one, Lebowski soars through the air after theives flying away on his carpet; in another, he dreams of a bowling musical, complete with bowling pin dancers and a valkyrie.",1005350400,,2943,4.841269841269841

I've seen this movie probably twenty times since its release, and it never bores or disappoints, and it never fails to get me laughing.

This is somewhat the plot of the movie.  I say some what because the Coen Brothers (makers of Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou, Blood Simple) let the actors show off 1st then they move onto the plot.  The plot is behind the acting, directing, and score to this orginal comedy.
The actors make this movie.  Jeff Bridges is literaly the Dude.  His only worried about his car, bowling, and drinking White Russians.  He is spaced through out most of the movie....simply Oscar worthy.  Walter is played by the big intemidating John Goodman.

997517,5,6304994540,"Okay, so I'm addicted to Coen Brothers films. I've seen every one made and I'm proud to say that they are all fine pieces of work. Out of every Coen Bros. movie, my favorite by far is ""The Big Lebowski"". Released in 1998, the movie became an instant cult hit and it's not hard to see why.
The story revolves around an aging hippie named Jeff Lebowski, otherwise known as the Dude. He's an unemployed, pot-smoking bowler who just so happens to have the same last name as a wealthy man. Bunny, the other Lebowski's wife (played by Tara Reid), owes money all over town, particularly to a known pornographer. The pornographer, thinking the Dude is the Lebowski he's after, sends some goons to collect money. After discovering that they have the wrong guy, the goons pee on the Dude's favorite rug. On top of that, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and the other Lebowski hires the Dude to drop the ringer and get her back. This starts a chain of events that introduces the Dude to toe-cutting Nihilists, weird artists and a slew of other interesting characters. Then there's the Dude's best bowling buddies, Walter (a short-tempered Vietnam vet) and Donnie (a shy pushover), played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. It's so funny to watch Walter constantly berate Donnie for ""being out of his element"". Out of all the characters in the movie, my favorite is Jesus Quintana, played by the ultratalented John Turturro. The scene where Quintana warns Walter about ""flashing a piece on the lane"" made me roll on the floor. It's a classic line.
This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Definantely worth the view and the buy. To all those like the Coen Brothers or just a good laugh in general, I have four words...Go Buy This Movie!!! You won't regret it.",1003363200,,1754,4.661290322580645

After The Dude gets mistaken for a wealthy cripple with the same name, he gets drawn into an elaborate kidnapping scheme, and all kinds of shananigans ensue.  While Bridges plays the loveable loser perfectly, it is the side characters who steal the show in this one.  Goodman as the Vietnam vet / Jewish convert is absolutely hilarious, as is his feeble-minded sidekick, played by Buscemi.  John Turturro, playing Jesus the pedophile bowling competitor, is brilliant as well.  You may not have loved this movie the first time you watched it, but give it another chance.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a classic in my mind, and is highly recommended for anyone looking to laugh and to discover the source of so many one-liners repeated constantly by Lebowski fans.",1003017600,,1120,4.832460732984293

The poor guy gets drawn into a convoluted mystery when his rug is soiled (""the rug tied up the entire room, man"") and he is mistaken for a millionaire named Lebowski. From that moment on the Dude goes through a crazy quilt of a city known as Los Angeles encountering every weirdo that the full moon can bring out (feminist artists, pornographers, a gang of nihilist Germans etc.)Actor Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the Dude. Nobody seems to want to leave this poor guy alone! He is thrown into a mystery when all he wants to do is bowl and get stoned! Special mention should be made of actor John Goodman, who plays the Dude's totally obnoxious, Vietnam obsessed, buddy. Goodman practically steals the film as he rants and raves and keeps getting the Dude into deeper and deeper trouble.

The film was chosen by the instructor of my Interanalytical Writing course for the class to view and write a paper on.  Our purpose was to compare ""The Dude"" to the traditional hero or ""outlaw"" hero, using two corresponding essays from our text.  Its more fun than it sounds.
The film itself is very unique.  Bridges plays Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski, a lazy, unemployed, pot smoking, White Russian sipping, Bowler, leftover from the hippie generation.  One day the Dude is met at home by two thugs who mistake him for a millionaire (the Big Lebowski) who's wife owes a lot of money to their boss.  The thugs dunk the Dude's head in the toilet and urinate on his favorite rug that ""ties the room together"" - Not cool.  Dude takes his ""rug problem"" to the Big Lebowski (BL), who gives him a lecture and sends him away.  The Dude takes it upon himself to pick out a rug from the BL's mansion on the way out.
Next, Bunny, the BL's young, porn star, wife is supposedly kidnapped and the BL summons the Dude to take the ""ransom"" to the ""Nihilist"" kidnappers who are holding her.  The Dude is aided and hindered (mostly hindered) by his loyal pal, Walter (Goodman), a Vietnam vet with a short temper, love for bowling, obligation to his ex wife's dog, and a refusal to do anything on the Sabbath, since he has converted to Judaism.  The Dude meets many characters along the way such as Jesus the bowler, Maude the feminist/artist and daughter of the BL, Ulee the porn star/Nihilist who has a pet ferret and used to have his own Kraftwerk like band (who have an album called ""Autobahn"", hmm interesting.), and maybe most importantly, the ""Stranger"", who appears at the bowling alley bar twice to help the Dude.
I won't reveal anymore specifics in case anyone else has neglected to witness this masterpiece.  I don't understand why viewers compare this to Fargo (1996).  They are totally different movies and Lebowski is much funnier and less dark in my opinion.  The one thing that Lebowski does have in common with Fargo and other films by the Coen Brothers, like Raising Arizona (1987) and O Brother Where Art Thou? (2000) are unique, often unforgettable characters.  Whether it is ""Hi"" or Leonard Smalls from Raising, Marge or Carl and Gaear (the kidnappers) from Fargo, Ulysses, Pete, or Delmar from O Brother, or The Dude, Walter, and Jesus from Lebowski - You can guarantee they won't leave your mind too soon after meeting them.
My favorite scene from the BL?  When Walter and The Dude go to question Larry Sellers (the 15 year old son of Arthur Digby Sellers - comatose writer of 156 episodes ""The bulk of the series"" of ""Branded"") about the missing money that was in the Dude's car.  Walter begins with a polite questioning that goes nowhere and follows with ""Plan B"" where he goes outside and using a crowbar, destroys what he thinks is the sports car that Larry bought with the money.  Walter repeatedly yells, ""Larry, this is what happens when you F a stranger up the ass!!!""  but  guess what? - its not Larry's car!

At times the movie gently rolls over you like a warm lover in bed, it also dishes out a lot of hard-hitting strife and conflict. By giving you a taste of the Dude's laid back attitude and juxtaposing it with an increasingly harrowing series of events, the movie really creates a visceral experience for the viewer. But despite everything the Dude goes through, he comes out alright in the end.
What helps ease the suspense are a series of long, slow motion musical interludes. They use scenes from the Dude's dreams as well as his favorite pastime, bowling. I loved every single one.
The narration is so good, there just isn't enough. Also, you watch the movie and have a chance to solve the mystery yourself, as the Dude eventually does. There's plenty of depth to explore in the meantime though. And lots of laughs.
Not every scene is perfect -- sometimes the dialogue feels more like a slap in the face. But much of the movie is that much more gratifying and on the whole, it is a pretty cohesive work. The Big Lebowski loses out the most on replay value though, which is why it only gets a 4.. and maybe should only be 3.5. But don't deny yourself seeing this movie at least once.

997754,5,6304994540,"With ""The Stranger"" Sam Elliot narrating us along, we come to meet our 'hero', The Dude (Jeff Bridges) in one of his best performances of his career.  A trio of bowling pals (Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi) are all in for a fun and wild ride which involve a mitricated-upon rug, a provocatively young trophy wife, a gang of nihilists who tote a ferret, an erotic artist who wants to conceive a child, interwoven references of Vietnam, a missing toe with green nail polish, a New Age dance recital, and President George Bush's speech of ""not standing"" aggression.  If this sounds almost as wacked-out as the Coens' prior works of Fargo, Barton Fink, and The Hudsucker Proxy, you're right.
This film gets even wackier than most of their oeuvre.  The Coens' place hilarious dream sequences which look straight out of Old Hollywood glam musical productions, but instead of Fred Astaire, we have The Dude.  As one of the great anti-heroes of recent film, The Dude shows us any man, including a grossly lazy, amazingly sloppy one, can be admirable.
Once again, the Coen brothers take the simple scenario (this time, a story of mistaken identity), and weave it into a comic work of ""what now?"".  Never have such one-demensional characters been given so much to do, and this film will leave you in stitches.
Unduly ignored at the box office (it was released during the first quarter of the calender year--traditionally known as a time when the movie going public tends to stay home), this film has become well respected as a rental and purchase.

I love the Coen brothers' work for the most part and I thought _Fargo_ was genius, so I had high hopes for their follow-up, and this was not at all what I expected. But since that first viewing, I've rented the film a few times and finally purchased a copy. In fact, I'm starting to get to the point where I think this might actually be a better film than _Fargo_.
It's a perfect mix of aimless characters and a seemingly aimless plot. From the first moments, with a hilarious voice-over by Sam ELLIOT (Sam Neill is from New Zealand), this film cast its own quirky spell. If you're willing to give yourself over to its unique charm, this one's a real winner. Jeff Bridges plays a character named Lebowski, nicknamed ""The Dude."" He wanders around in a bathrobe, drinking milk right out of the carton at the grocery store. His days seem to be devoted to getting stoned and the one love of his life: bowling, with pals John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.
When Bridges' Lebowski gets confused with another Lebowski, a wealthy man whose young wife is ""kidnapped,"" Bridges gets called on to deliver the ransom and what ensues is something of a detective story, flipped on its head, with one strange and funny vignette after another. I don't know what it is about this film, but I've watched it again and again and have yet to grow tired of it.

It's a sort of 90's battle cry).
The story about the ""trophy wife"", the Nihilist Germans (look for Flea of the Chili Peppers, who says stuff like, ""YAAAUU LEWWBOFSKI!""), the Karl Hungus, Jackie Treehorn fiasco; the rug, the marmont, Larry Sellers- the crappy student, Brandon, Kraftwerk-like German droners, and the mysterious artiste, Ms. Maude Lebowski, are all secondary to the dialogue and the interplay by these, well, losers, who somehow carry on despite themselves.

Instead, he gets caught up in a huge debacle regarding a kidnapping and tries to get repairations for his carpet. ""That carpet really tied the room together""
The casting in this movie fits just right, and the story is a good one. The Coen brothers have turned the story of a bum into a winner. The lackadaisical attitude of The Dude really makes this movie. Most other characters would have made themselves pro-active to solve thier dilema, while The Dude just strolls through. It adds a nice element that Bridges plays well.
The Dude's attitude is well offset by John Goodman's potrayal of Walter. He's the over-the-top Vietman vet, who seems like he could just snap at any second, and on a couple occasions, does.
The middle of the road in this trio is Donny, who is a subtle guy that seems like he is the odd man out between Walter and The Dude. While Donny is in the movie, he' not really part of the story, and this throws a few laughs in for the audience.
The most powerful character in this flick is the one with the least time on screen. That would be Jesus. John Turturro does a superb job of adding a lot of laughs in a small amount of time by playing a bowler with an overt attitude, and a nice surprise that makes it even funnnier.
The plot is nice and simple, but The Dude can't seem to keep up with it until it's too late. This adds to the entertainment as he tries to get his goal accomplished, but is hampered by his lifestyle and by Walter.
Some will say this movie is a waste of time with no story, but don't let others keep you from a winner. If you don't like it, or didn't like it the last time you saw it, you need to try it again as it gets better with time.",984009600,,1805,4.204610951008646

Bridges hits a solid high note as The Dude, and John Goodman is sterling as his traumatized Viet-Vet bowling buddy Walter.

Watching the paper-thin plot and Jeff Bridges do his bumbling stoner routine throughout the movie didn't do it for me the first time.  Like most of the Coens' movies though, I think this one rewards repeat viewings.  Once you don't have to worry about the story and you can just sit back and enjoy the characters, the show is a fun ride.
Jeff Bridges is well-cast as ""The Dude"", the white-Russian-loving Californian caught up in a twisted kidnapping case after two thugs show up to whiz on his favorite rug.  His character was a lot more enjoyable the second time I saw this flick.  I wish I could say the same for John Goodman's turn as an overbearing 'Nam vet; I usually like him but I thought it was painful to watch him chew up scenery in this movie.  Pretty much all of the supporting characters are entertaining, especially John Turturro as a bowling ex-pedophile and Julianne Moore as a detached avant-garde artist.  Nice touches: Ben Gazzara's bit as a porn magnate was reminiscent of his strip-club-owner's role in ""Killing of a Chinese Bookie"", and there is a great gag in his mansion that references a hotel-room scene in ""North by Northwest"".
The movie does have some ""Hey, look what we can do with a camera!"" moments, but they're usually appropriately surreal and entertaining.  My main complaint is the fuzzy, aimless, along-for-the-ride style.  ""Lebowski"" has enough amusing gags and characters to make it enjoyable to watch, but watching it leaves me feeling as stoned and dim as the lead character.

The plot may be a bit ludicrous, but pound-for-pound, it is as funny as any Coen brothers film, or as funny as ANY other film, for that matter. The interactions between Bridges and bowling buddies Steve Buscemi (his normal, wormy, squinting self) and John Goodman (a big crazy, militant nut, to say the least) are priceless.
The supporting cast is hilarious, also: John Tuturro as Jesus, the pederast Latin bowler (""Dios Mio, man...""), Juliane Moore as a feminist modern painter, and Flea (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a nihlist mobster (""Ya, vhere's da money, Leh-bow-skee?"") are among the many highlights.
The movie's quotability factor is through the roof. Go bowling after this movie, and you'll find yourself reciting 10-minute scenes.

997948,4,6304994540,"The Coen Brothers' Big Lebowski's tongue-in-cheek humor is very entertaining with superb casting especially since some of the roles (like Goodman's and Buscemi's) were written specifically for the actors.  John Goodman is hilarious in his role as a trigger-happy veteran who throws Jeff Bridges' laidback (i.e. stoned) life out of control.  It all begins when Bridges, whose character's name is Jeff Lebowski but prefers to be called 'Dude', gets mistaken for a millionaire of the same name in Pasadena.  A pair of thugs ruin 'the Dude's' rug 'that tied the room together' and on Goodman's insistence Bridges tracks down the ""Big Lebowski"" to get compensated.  From there the plot gets more and more complicated in strange/humorous ways.
Some of the minor characters include Steve Buscemi as the third wheel of the Bridges/Goodman duo to Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers as one of the German kidnappers. John Turturro almost steals the show as the child-molesting, hair-net wearing, bowling ball tonguing competitor.  Julianne Moore is very good as the feminist artist who paints nude in a flying harness and is also in the excellent Busby Berkley sequence as a viking woman complete with duo braids and elaborate dancing showgirls wearing bowling ball pins.
The DVD has a well-designed menu in the theme of the bowling alley with the cheesy neon stars and lights.  There are bios of the main actors including John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and Sam Elliott (the cowboy stranger), as well as their filmographies.  The special features don't include any deleted scenes but does have trailers and an informative ""Making of"" with the Coen Brothers.  There are subtitles for English, French, and Spanish but no dubs.  I noticed that the copy I had is slightly off in one scene in the audio and video sychronization towards the second half of the movie. The actors' mouths are moving and the dialogue follows a half-second behind, but it's only the one scene and I don't know if all the DVD pressings are like this.  The DVD features auto-play but first asks if you want to view it in the wide-screen or regular format which is nice.

997949,1,6304994540,"When I try to think of the worst films I've ever watched, a lot of titles could crowd my mind: Stigmata, Godzilla, Lost in Space, Forrest Gump, the last four Jerry Bruckheimer movies, and so on. But movies like these are bad simply beacuse they are forgettably bad. The Big Lebowski is always there in my mind because it is unforgettably bad.
Pointlessly set during the Gulf War (the war never features in it after this) the story is about a Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who is mistaken for another guy called Lebowski whose daughter has been kidnapped. Bridges gets Goodman involved, and various supposedly colourful characters drift by, until the mystery basically solves itself, with no involvement from the protagonists. Sam Elliot appears at the conclusion to spout some bewildering nonsense that's meant to tack an explanation onto the end. Deep.
Some movies are plotless and entertaining: this one is plotless and pointless. I guess John Goodman plays a hilarious character because he keeps saying things like 'They peed on your f***ing rug man' and 'Shut the f*** up Donny' (the film's killer line - we know this because it's repeated endlessly). And this is part of the problem: the characters are so self-consciously 'quirky' and off-the-wall that none of them work. It's just the Coens realising what their target market is like and deciding to go into overkill. Even amid all this wilful, random eccentricity they can't find any originality. For example: the main character is an ex-hippy still living in the 60s, and what do they decide to call him? The Dude.
If you find pointless vulgarity and violence entertaining (at one point Goodman chews a guy's ear off and spits it in the air - always a good scene to have in a comedy) then this is your movie. But for me, this movie fails a simple test: a comedy should be funny at least once.
Empire magazine (whose contributions to film criticism have included such surveys as 'Toilets in the Movies' and 'Masturbation in the Movies') concluded their review of this film with the statement: 'In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers'.

The constellation colourful and entertaining characters is another feature of the film: the Dude's wierd landlord (into strange amateur dance routines), the militant feminist played by Juliana Moore, the sycophantic personal assistant played by whatshisname Hoffman (played George in Scent of a woman, the gang of nihilists, the porn king, the bimbo kidnapee and - topping them all - the sexually perverted bowler player called (blasphemically) Jesus. If these characters didn't even interact - I mean if there was not plot at all to the movie - it would still be fun to watch them from hours on end just doing everyday things.
As it is the plot is rather good. Most importantly at the end of the film it becomes known that the Dude will become a father. This is good news because it creates a good foundation for a sequel (the ""Little Lebowski"", perhaps).

Following along the lines of other bumbling detective yarns like Charles Bukowski's ""Pulp"" and Jon Hammer's graphic novel ""The Drowned Girl"", this story revolves around the circumstances that throw Jeff Bridge's laconic ""Dude"" in the middle of a bizzare kidnapping and ransom case.  As the plot unwinds, the central mystery of the the kidnapping becomes unimportant; one's attention is drawn to the strange cast of characters who float effortlessly in and out of the Dude's life as he gets more an mroe wrapped up.
Essentially a flawless film, without the awkward and grim brutality of a film like ""Fargo"".  For some reason this movie is often overlooked when talking about great films of the 90's, or even great films of the Coen brothers!

Bridges gives a bill murray style nonchalance performance and pulls it off very nicely.  When the germans are breaking into his house and he says ""this is a private residence"" I'm not sure why, but I died laughing. Other parts have a genius flair as well, like the pederest bowler Jesus and the guy who stepped over the bowling lane line and wouldn't forfeit his score of pins. Things that hold no particular component of the story but are just there because they are funny. The person who wrote the story may have just been waiting for a movie like this to give them an outlet for some extremely bright material.

What's most interesting is the way the story is told.  This is the movie your stoned roommate could've written, if only he knew a damn thing about dialogue, casting, and, oh yes, directing.
The characters here are rich, complex, and finely balanced against one another.  Watching them work off each other is to invite yourself to see the movie countless times to catch every nuance of their performance.
This is no accident of good lighting, nor happenstance of the editing room.  It is the explicit design of the brothers Cohen, who must now surely be considered auteur.  Just as in FARGO and RAISING ARIZONA, they here continue to prove their ability to create not just a story but an environment.  Theirs is direction by immersion, not merely by camera angle.
Anyone looking for lessons on how to write mesmerizing dialogue, how to create whole worlds without delving into the realm of fantasy or science fiction, would do well to start here.
But then again so would anyone just wishing to have a great time at the movies.

Possibly the movie I  have rewatched more than any other, the Big Lebowski is a convoluted romp  that showcases the genius of the Coen Brothers and a solid solid cast.
John Goodman fans know that the Coen Brothers do him right, and this  film is my favorite Goodman performance yet. John Turturro puts in a  spectacular cameo as a bowling pervert, and Jeff Bridges is perfect as the  pot-laden anchor of relative sanity that the insane plot revolves around.

""Lebowski"" is an subtle, ironic, laconic spoof (sendup, homage,  whatever) of the detective movie, of the hard-boiled Sam Spade in his  relentless pursuit of the truth.

That's a shame in a way, but it's also a testament to  the artistic integrity of the Coen brothers: They didn't yield to the  temptation (pressure?) to duplicate the formula of that earlier work in  order to simply bring in the dollars.  Good for them.
""The Big  Lebowski,"" while certainly more loose in structure than  ""Fargo,"" succeeds largely on the strength of its often  wickedly-funny exchanges between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.  Anyone who  has known a ""Dude"" in his or her life will likely be won over by  Bridges' portrayal.  Also, Goodman's performance was a real revelation to  me, as he absolutely owned his role.
If I were to rate the movie based  purely on how much I liked it, I'd peg it at five stars for sure.

I  appreciate any movie that can mix bowling, performance art (both painted  and danced), Saddaam, and Nihilistic German Pornographic Actors, without  blinking an eye.
The masterminds behind all of this fantastic  cross-pollination are the Coen Brothers (Fargo, Raising Arizona, Barton  Fink, etc.).  I feel only in their hands could something that should be  random and pompous turn out so fun and tightly constructed.

998169,4,6304994540,"The Big Lebowski is a wonderful, underrated comedy with great acting and an interesting plot. The unusual characters bring on a love hate relationship. If you love them this comedy might become one of your  favorites. If not, give it a chance, you might change you mind on your  second viewing.
Jeff Bridges plays ""the dude"" who is an unemployed, laid  back hippie. John Goodman is Walter Sobchak, an over reacting, Vietnam  veteran who thinks that every situation has at least a literal connection  to the Vietnam war. Finally Steve Buscemi plays Donnie, who is pretty  clueless individual, always cutting in on the middle of a conversation.  ""Out of his element"" Walter says to Donnie. These three opposites make up a  league bowling team. Nearly half the film revolves around bowling. The plot  begins when Jeffrey Lebowski (the dude) has his house broken into, his head  repeatedly forced into a toilet bowl, and his rug peed on, an item which  ""ties the room together"". It turns out that the assailants goofed,  originally  planning to harass the other Jeffrey Lebowski, the older richer  Jeffery Lebowski, who's ""trophy"" wife, Bunny, owes money around town, even  to known pornographers. These ""rug pee-ers"" came to collect, but showed up  at the house of the wrong Jeffery Lebowski. This sounds bizarre, but don't  worry the film gets even more bizarre as it goes on.
Jeff Brides, John  Goodman, and Steve Buscemi are all fantastic at these unusual rolls,  enhancing the humor of the nihilistic plot. However, some audiences might  find this film perverse and unappealing. Give it a chance though.

The minor characters truly add to this movie- Bunny's first  scene had me searching for an ATM and Jesus warrants at least two rewinds  himself- but the bread and butter is The Dude, played beautifully by Jeff  Bridges.  The Dude is a 60s-esque stoner/slacker whose most brilliant  dialogue happens when he is most confused.  His response to a nasty threat  from Jesus:  ""Well that's, like... your opinion, man.""  Or when  confronted with a glimpse of an older man's tears:  ""Bummer.""

It was too late, though. I was hooked.

This is equivalent to watching the Big Sleep (the template for  ""Lebowski"" -- the Coen Bros. say the film is their old hippie  friend cast in the lead of the Big Sleep) and wishing Bogart and Bacall  would stop talking and get on with the mystery, itself impossible to  decipher. If you can stop worrying about the mystery and just relax, the  film ranks with Python's Holy Grail for hilarious exchanges and individual  scenes.

998261,5,6304994540,"First, read all seven novels of Raymond Chandler. That's the beginning. (Yes, The Dude is Marlowe.)

Next, compare the film to two other all-time greats: Richard Lester's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (music; nearly flawless cinematography; absurd and jarring juxtapositions) and Richard Linklater's BEFORE SUNRISE (the thematic similarity: the attempt to communicate meaningfully as a member of the human species). If you don't get the connections I suggest, then you won't get the connections. (There's a beverage here, man!)

Next, recognize that cult films reverberate for a reason. Meeting a random guy at a bar with whom one suddenly forms a strong bond when one utters the line, ""Effing Nazis"": that's indicative of deep structures. One must assume that this film reaches far into the human psyche without one's needing to understand why.

Next, recognize that the casting is perfect, as is the frame-by-frame editing. Note that The Stranger makes the film possible.

Note that the music is as big a character as Walter and the Dude. Without the music, it would not be the greatest film ever made.

Note that one primary theme is the human race's attempt to communicate with mutual understanding and that in every instance in the film, the attempt fails. (Again, compare with BEFORE SUNRISE. Linklater's film is the other end of the continuum, but the theme is precisely the same.)

Note, then, the irony that the audience understands this perfectly (that the film is about the inability of humans to understand one another), even if one might not be able to articulate the idea.

Note that one of the reasons the film cuts so deeply is that we ourselves are The Dude. (We have seen ourselves, and we are The Dude. And we are Walter. And Donny. And little Larry.)

Note that one can watch the film a seemingly infinite number of times and still find nuances that one has missed. The film coheres and coheres and coheres, although it's a film about incoherence.

Note how well one can make analogies with other works that feature Jungian archetypes: THE WIZARD OF OZ; GONE WITH THE WIND; DEATH OF A SALESMAN; riff on forever--this is a remarkable embodiment of our heroes with a thousand faces.)

Note that the jokes never cease to be funny. ""An Irish monk?"" ""It's already the tenth."" ""The Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint.""

Okay, that's enough from me. The Coens had extra time on this one because of the delay in getting Bridges and Goodman at the same time. So these fanatic storyboarders had time to be more fanatical than usual. They were inspired. The timing was right. They transcended themselves. There is no explanation.

Serious scholars can write enlightening books about this film. I suggest a few angles above. The Chandler interconnections alone are worth a monograph.

But one need not write such stuff unless one enjoys the process.

Because that, too, is the whole point: Enjoy it. Despite the police chief of Mailbu, it's the whole dern human comedy. Watch it again and again because one then can feel that one wasn't gypped by the good Lord.

(And if you never got it: ""I see England, I see France; I see queenie's underpants."" That's a clunker.)

Here's what I wrote years ago about the film. It's still true:

One needs to have a pronounced sense of absurdity to appreciate this film. But personally having an existence in which I have been forced to worship the Great God Irony, I find THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be truly a perfect film.  Its humor is incessant; its ensemble cast performs flawlessly; the closing  image of a professional bowler scoring yet another strike surely is  emblematic of the film's own technical, emotional, artistic, intellectual,  and psychological success.

Jeff Bridges as the Dude, a sixties burn-out and slacker--and John Goodman as Walter Sobchek,  Vietnam Vet and devout Jew--form a heavenly  union. The shaggy-dog-story plot is the skeleton upon  which hangs an utterly immaculate set of absurdist images, from the  Hispanic deodorizer of shoes to the BRANDED writer in the iron lung to the  blanket-tossed beach party babe (whose costume changes to a devilish red when she's glimpsed in the Dude's dream sequence: only the Coen brothers could incorporate such minor details with such intelligence and  purpose!).

I've watched this film literally twenty times. Its power does  not fade. It satisfies every time. Each moment, each camera angle, each  cut, each fade, each expression, each utterance: perfection itself! The  maniacally laughing policeman in the car lot; the In-and-Out Burgers through the broken windshield; the crematorial ashes in the Dude's face:  what brilliance!

Buy it; watch it again and again. Ye who have eyes and ears to see and hear--enjoy!

To all the people involved in making the film: congratulations on being in precisely the right place at the right time. Life almost never works this way. And that's why we like the Dude at the check-out line with the half-and-half on his mustache. The Dude: C'est moi!",961113600,,5003,4.965186074429772

In a case of mistaken identity, some thugs harass the dude  about some money they think his wife owes to Jackie Treehorn, the biggest  porno producer on the west coast. In the confusion one of these 2 gentlemen  decides to relieve himself on the dude's rug that by the way, ""really  tied the room together"".
The dude figures out that the other  Lebowski, the ""Big Lebowski"", the millionaire that these thugs  were looking for should compensate him for the rug, which would NOT have  gotten peed on by the ""china man"" had his wife not owed money all  over town. After the rug issue is settled the dude learns later that the  ""Big Lebowski's wife, ""Bunny"" has been kidnapped by  Nihilists of all people! They want the dude to act as a currier to deliver  1 million dollars to the kidnappers in the hopes that he can identify these  thugs as the men who soiled his rug that ""really tied the room  together"".
Walter [John Goodman], of course, f's it up trying to  relive a Vietnam flashback. The kidnappers get a suitcase full of Walter's  dirty undies instead of the money! While trying to drown his sorrows in  bowling, the dude's car with the million dollars still in the trunk is  stolen by a kid named Larry Sellers, who ""lives off Radford, near the  In and Out Burger"". Will the dude get the money back before the  Nihlists cut off his johnson? And what of the rug and the dude's car? Will  the kidnappers kill ""Bunny"" before the dude can get Larry to  crack and give up the money? Or can Maude, a rich femenist hold the answer?  Unfortunately this movie was a bummer at the box office but it is truly one  of the great comedies of the decade. Get this movie today and ""take it  easy man"".",957744000,,2486,4.487695749440716
998391,5,6304994540,"Although there are already close to 200 reviews for this movie here, I love this movie so much that I have to add my own two cents.
Everything about this film is absolutely brilliant. The dialogue (the main drawing  point), the cast selection (which is flawless), the scene shooting... One  fascinating aspect of this movie is that the humour goes from being subtle  to over the top in the same scene and they're both equally effective. The  dialogue is fast-paced, but after you watch it a few times, you begin to  pick up the subtleties within the film.
Another thing, many people  complain about the plot being too weak, but this is more than just another  kidnapping plot. The actual plot itself is quite complex, and only after I  watched the film many times did I have a cohesive idea of what happened.
This is most likely THE funniest movie I have ever seen. A lot of the  humour is subtle, but totally hilarious. The funniest main character (in my  own humble opinion) would have to be Walter. Maybe because the character  reminds me of some aquaintences of mine, but he is just so bizarre yet  believable at the same time.
As for my favorite supporting character, I  think I'd have to go with the popular opinion and choose Jesus. This  character is the funniest thing I've ever seen. His whole demeanor is just  classic. Cocky and perverted.
There are so many sub-plots in TBL that  it's neccesary to watch it over and over again to fully absorb it. And  after you do that, you'll still watch it over and over just for sheer  enjoyment.  This is the only movie that my entire cirle of friends has  embraced.
One more thought....notice how most of the reviews here for  TBL are either five stars or one? I guess this just seperates those who  ""get it"" from those who don't.",957744000,,1782,4.537735849056604
998392,5,6304994540,"This has to be one of my favourite films, in whole due to the absolute genius of the lead character ""the dude"". The movie starts with one of the funniest deliveries around, wait for the dudes answer to  ""Where's the money Lebowski"". And that's the premise for the  movie, two Lebowskis, one rich, one the dude, and a case of mistaken  identity that results in someone pissing on the dude's rug.
I won't give  away anything, as this film is best seen as a series of events that are  expertly pieced together by the dude. The Coens have really made a  masterpiece here, and its a shame that they were Oscared for Fargo whereas  The Big Lebowski is bar far a funnier and innovative movie.
If you  haven't seen it, and you find eithe the Coens funny or like the idea of an  almost abstract plot that has some of the best dream sequences around, then  get this. Its a comic festival, ready to be played whenever you want it.",957657600,,919,4.352941176470588

998394,5,6304994540,"Sam Elliot's portrayal of the bemused Stranger in a ten-gallon hat hovers over The Big Lebowski with a twinkle in its eye. The Los Angeles he comes to visit has fallen far from the American ideal he represents. The grace of  this film is that in the hands of the Coen brothers the disparity between  the venality of real America and the mythic cowboy credo we still delude  ourselves with can be played for its humanity as well as for laughs.
Only  distorted and nightmarish echoes remain of the upright, plain speaking  loner who rides through the West of our imagination, guided by principles  as invariant as the stars that keep him company. The stars still shine for  Jeff Lebowski, commonly known as The Dude, but they are the stars of the  Hollywood Lanes. League bowling is one of the few organizing principles he  has left. Another is the Persian rug on the living room floor of his ratty  bachelor apartment.  ""It tied the room together.""  When intruders urinate  on that rug, mistaking him for another Jeff Lebowski that owes their boss  money, The Big Lebowski sets off into the desert of American morality,  circa 1991.
There are still cowboys; George Bush squares off against  Saddam Hussein, but we all know he's really defending US commerce. Walter  Sobchak, The Dude's sidekick and a Vietnam veteran who will not leave the  war behind, compulsively defends the moral code of TV westerns against all  comers, but is unable to stop himself from trampling all over those values  in the process. One of Walter's heroes, the screenwriter for the bulk of  the Branded series, lies comatose in an iron lung having fathered little  Larry, an illiterate cold-eyed car thief of eleven. Even the Big Lebowski,  a civic leader who lost the use of his legs during the Korean War, obtained  his wealth and power only by marrying a rich wife. The Dude gave up his  pretensions to standing up for anything, softening his fall from 60's left  wing political activism with a steady haze of marijuana smoke and White  Russians. But he alone retains any empathic vestige of cowboy  gallantry.
For all of Walter's blandishments he and the other characters  can look no further than their own self-interest. John Goodman's Walter  leaps to the attack not so much to stick up for his buddies as to stave off  a sense of nihilistic dread, ""Say what you want about National Socialism;  at least it was an ethos!"" In the world of The Big Lebowski ""ethos"" has  become a personal affair. It is an existence shrunk to a vicious circle of  lost faith leading to selfish defensiveness. Multiplied by the population  this retrenchment has created a cacophony of conflicting personal visions  where the old social contracts are no longer respected.  The expected link  between moral cause and effect is subject to derailment at any time and  without notice. Even Jesus does not save. He is just another bowler, a  gleefully vicious psychopathic sex offender, teamed up with a stolid  whitebread partner who is undoubtedly a conservative pillar of his Baptist  Church. John Turturro's Jesus gives new meaning to ""Suffer the little  children to come unto me"".
In the resulting cultural chaos the urge to  create some means of personal salvation intensifies, and devil take the  hindmost. Walter's shell is his deranged homage to the Western hero. For  the Big Lebowski it is championing the cause of Horatio Alger through  sponsorship of the Lebowski Little Achievers. His daughter, Maude, finds  her solace in the bosom of avant garde ""vaginal art"". Only Jeff Bridges as  The Dude, fortified by substance abuse, is able to keep his eyes open and  accept the world on its own terms.
He may be stoned, drunk, lazy, and  aimless, but he is, in the Stranger's terms, ""the man for his time"", a  master cowboy who rides serenely off into the sunset strumming his guitar  to an audience of cactus and coyotes. In The Dude's world, our world,  ambition and achievement are all too often defensive dodges. The Stranger  and The Dude know that after all is said and done he who dies with the most  toys or the best story. . . dies. And in the process of achieving or trying  to force reality to conform to any given storyline violence is too easily  done to those who fall within its shadow.  The Dude doesn't have any  answers, but he doesn't want to contribute to the problem.
In such a  seemingly acausal world nihilism, the belief in nothing, must pop up. It  does in the form of three avowed German Nihilists bent on scoring a ransom  for the Big Lebowski's errant and allegedly kidnapped wife, Bunny. But even  as The Dude and Walter discuss their response to the kidnappers' demands it  is clear that these nihilists are poseurs; they believe they will get money  by terrorizing the Big Lebowski and his bagman, The Dude. As Walter freaks  out over the nihilistic menace he is sitting comfortably next to a man who  comes closer to real nihilism than any he is ever likely to meet.
The  Coen in The Big Lebowski is that The Dude cares. He has no schemes; his  moments are their own reward. He and the world he inhabits may be a twisted  caricature of how human life should be, but it is enough as it is. The  Stranger, angel emissary of a reality that never existed, respects that.",956102400,,5260,4.708470847084708

Every character is a completely  original creation, from John"" YOU ARE ENTERING A WORLD OF PAIN""  Goodman, Jeff ""The Dude "" Bridges and Julianne ""Maude""  Moore. There are many sequences in this film when you think it has peaked,  but then the Coens top it with an even more outragous scene. Wittness the  spectacular sequence after the dude slams his face on the table and  imagines himself in a viking/porn dream with ""I JUST DROPPED IN TO SEE  WHAT CONDITION MY CONDITION WAS IN- I FOUND MY MIND IN A BROWN PAPER  BAG"", belted out on the soundtrack. Its a scene of pure delecious  delerium. This all in a service of a plot so convolted that following it is  strictly optional, but then you won't mind because you'll still be  unravelling it by the third time you see it. Ofcourse let me not forget the  great John Tuttoro ""JESUS"" who bowls to a spanish variation of  ""The Hotel California"" in scene which will give an ulcer from  luaghter. While I still think that the Coen's 1990 crime classic Miller's  Crossing was their best, the quirky character comedy Fargo in second, and  Lebowski in third.

Throw in Sam  Neil of western movie fame and even Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers (in  a rather bizarre role), and you cannot miss with this film. There are so  many wonderful and just plain odd, seemingly random things that make this  movie great.

Happily unemployed and unambitious,  Jeff Lebowski, who strongly insists on  being referred to as ""The Dude"", is the mellowest man you'll ever  know.  He goes with the flow, and as the plot unravels, the flow introduces  a cast of outrageous characters nuttier than the ones in the Dude's  immediate circle. The Dude's bowling partner and best friend is the  slightly psychotic war veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), who is easily  riled up when it comes to bowling scores, Vietnam, or his conversion to  Orthodox Judaism.  The Dude's formidable bowling adversary is the skinny,  oily, Latin-groove swinging ex-con, Jesus (John Turturro) who colorfully  taunts his opponents.  There isn't a single bad performance in the film  although Julianne Moore as the bizarre gothic-erotic artist seems a bit  forced.  The Dude, born Jeff Lebowski, has his relaxed existence shaken up  when he is mistaken for someone with the same name.  The other Jeff  Lebowski is older, reclusive, and worth millions. The elder Lebowski (David  Huddleston)also has a hot young wife named Bunny(Tara Reid), who has ties  to a dark underworld of porn stars and nihilists.  The Dude gets shuffled  into the mix and drags Walter along for the ride. The tension between the  chilled-out dude and the high strung Walter works marvelously. The story,  however, spins but goes nowhere. The flamboyant dream sequences are fun but  they seem to fill up empty space where a plot should be. This is another  interesting and worthwhile effort by the Coen brothers(Miller's Crossing,  Fargo, Raising Arizona) who wrote and directed the film.

He's been cult (see Lebowski or American Heart), mainstream  (The Fisher King or The Mirror has Two Streisands-eek!), but as an aging  stoner caught up in world peopled by those even weirder than he is, Bridges  has reached a sort of character nirvana. How can you not just love the  guy?
The brilliant Coens again display a kaleidoscopic range of genres,  themes, techniques, and plot lines. Lebowski's a wonder to behold. Here,  the bleakness of Fargo is replaced with a dazzling colorwheel showcased  particularly in The Dude's hilarious dreams. If there's a point to this  whole affair, I missed it.

People are gonna write negative things about my review. Yeah, well, get  over it or get a life. Either one. Fargo was so much more superior to this  film (not to mention so many other films). I popped this into my VCR with  such high hopes. Turns out I couldn't even watch the entire thing; it was  about 3 in the afternoon and I didn't feel like napping. It's a movie about  a guy who takes ransom money. It was a good idea, but presented in a  sloppy, over-stylish fashion. The only reason I give it two stars is  because of John Goodman's gun-toting character. Hehe. I guess it's worth a  look if you liked the Coen's previous movies just to see that every master  has their one failure. A drag, to say the least.",945129600,,862,4.144578313253012

I guess with movies that have no real plot, there can't actually  be much of a natural ending.  It had pointless obscene language and drug  use.  The dialogue was not funny, in fact the characters were so stupid  with their back-and-forth it was frustrating.  Maybe all the pot-smokers  out there will think it's trippy, but if you aren't into that, don't waste  your time on this one.",945129600,,541,4.541666666666667

An unusual idea, I know, but who said the Coen Brothers are your usual film fare. The film's interwoven and dense  script starts from the beginning; for example when they show ""the  dude"" watching George Bush saying his famous, ""this agression  will not stand."" Then you hear later in the bowling alley ""the  dude"" trying to use this quote like it is in his subconscious, but of  course he screws up the line. I love John Goodman as the guy who has to  make everything connect with his Vietnam experiences and the way he tries  to take control of every situation, but he always ends up losing it. The  film though is a modern interpretation of a Dashiell Hammett novel.  ""The dude"" is the reluctant snoop who never actually does  anything, but ends up solving the case. The only time ""the dude""  actually does any investigative work, he gets dick... literally... he gets  the picture drawn by porn tycoon Jackie Treehorn. The characters are  unforgetable, the dialog ""is good to beat the bad,"" the direction  and script are genius, and the story's ""in English too.""",944956800,,1170,4.64390243902439

Anyone who enjoys their work will find it very funny, and their humour is taken to surreal heights this time around. A lot of people  don't like this film, but let me tell you something. Compare this to any  other films of the 90s and it comes out as one of the best. People forget  that we are so inundated with absolutely banal cinema that once in a while,  when something good does come along, we miss out because we're too busy  watching rubbish like Armaggedon or Titanic. Script first, then film -  that's the way the Coens do it, and it always gets brilliant results. Any  scenes with the nihilists in this film are laugh out loud funny, and  Bridges is so apathetic it seems like he really is The Dude. Coen brothers  films are emminently quotable, and this one is no exception, along with a  series of setpieces that are marvellously mad - just watch the scene where  Goodman goes postal on a car. The dialogue is fresher than anything  Tarantino can do, the only other person able to reproduce the spoken  language so well being Elmore Leonard. Now there's a prospect - a Leonard  novel adapted by the Coens. We can hope. The interview on the disc is quite  interesting if only to see how the Coens hate being interviewed, moving  onto the subject of carpets instead of the actual film. Nice moving menus,  although they could have done with a bit of music, but DVD can take you to  all those brilliant scenes in the blink of an eye, so buy this liitle  beauty - you won't be dissapointed.",944956800,,1588,4.508771929824562

The catchy quotes embedded throughout the film are  the big winners in this one from the brothers.  Quotes like, ""It  really tied the room together, did it not"" is only one of the many  that can be brought into our lives as little tidbits of humor during  conversation.

It's the totally bizarre touches and the over-the-top characters  that make it great.  Jeff Bridges is a riot as the loser-stoner ""The  Dude"", aka Jeff Lebowski, who happens to share the name of a very  wealthy businessman whose wife owes money all over town.  Two men, thinking  the Dude is the wealthy Lebowski, come to his house to collect and then pee  on his rug, a rug that ""tied the room together."" All the Dude  wants is to be compensated for it. The wealthy Lebowski calls the Dude  after his wife is kidnapped, asking him to make the ransom delivery. He  brings his crazy Vietnam vet bowling buddy John Goodman along, and things  go to hell from there. The Dude is pursued by a group of German nihilists  who threaten to ""cut off his johnson"", and by a  ""vaginal"" feminist artist, who happens to be the daughter of the  wealthy Lebowski.  While the plot is funny enough, it is the little  touches that make it work.  Jesus the bowler is priceless, and the eulogy  of a fallen bowling comrade is too hilarious for words. Mainstream  audiences who relish stuff like ""The Waterboy"" may think it's too  weird, but it's too bad that they don't know what they are missing.
