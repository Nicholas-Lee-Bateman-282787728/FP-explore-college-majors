You get to see a side of Chef Ramsay that his other shows don't let you see. The packaging is very nice, but a bit delicate. ( I broke the box opening it!) All in all, a great purchase!",1466726400,,288,4.0701754385964914

8539391,5,B009B8YZEY,"..... Love Gordon Ramsay but ""Hell's Kitchen"", ""Master Chef"", and ""Kitchen Nightmare"" are just kind of wearing you down?  Then ""The F Word"" is a really pleasant change of pace!  By the way, F is for FOOD, not his favourite profanity though you will hear it in this uncensored series.  This show is much more informative with food-related segments in each episode.  For the first four seasons it's a competition by ""kitchen brigades"" but not head-to-head, but preparing a 3 course menu for the diners to decide to pay or not and that is the scoring criteria. Brigade with the highest score gets to appear at Ramsay's London restaurant in the finale.  That finale includes the main course of some domestic animal that has been raised for that purpose (turkeys, pigs, lambs & veal calfs).  Cooking techniques are demonstrated.  The fifth series is a competition for the best restaurant in Britain.  Big bonus is there is a very Human side of Ramsay you don't see on any of his other shows... the family man.  A sixth DVD is two Christmas episodes... very informative to prepare seasonal meals.  The six DVD sets come in a box resembling a recipe card box.
 ..... Only drawback, if you can call it that, are all the British celebrities, the vast majority are complete unknowns on this side of the Atlantic.  Wife an I both loved Janet Street-Porter.  She adds a lot of humor to the series as well as being the surrogate ""mother' to the two veal calfs in series four.  For those who are squeemish, there are scenes of the animals being killed either in the wild or in an  abattoir (AKA slaughterhouse) so may want children out of the room for those scenes.  It does however show you where your food comes from.  Profanity is censored (with the bleeps) in series 1, but no censoring series 2-5.
 ..... If you like Gordon Ramsay, I recommend it to you.  If you don't like Ramsay, you may just end up liking him after watching this series.  I would wish he would do this sort of series just for American TV.  It is very informative in many ways.",1405728000,,2037,4.556473829201102
8539392,5,B009B8YZEY,Amazing insight to gordon and his family!  Loved seeing him professionally and with people he cares about.  Turns out he shows how they correlated.  Gordon is my favorite chef!,1393718400,,176,5.0
8539393,5,B009B8YZEY,"I watched part of this on Netflix and Hulu, but couldn't find the whole thing so I ordered this box set when it was on sale. It was so worth it. Gordon teaches you so much about where food comes from and humane food practices (Though I am still not comfortable with Foie gras because he still gets his from more traditional channels.). Each episode you also get to learn about how he makes some of the dishes he is famous for, and you can find more details on each recipe online still. In my box Episode 2 of season 2 was omitted due to licensing issues, but this isn't their fault (also I believe that episode can be purchased from a variety of sites and seen on Netflix still). It is still an amazing series that is worth watching. It is free from some of the drama that annoys people in some of the American versions of his shows.",1391299200,,833,4.2125
8539394,5,B009B8YZEY,"Absolutely wonderful show.  Gordon Ramsay is a gem. Not only does he educate you, he entertains you as well.  Absolutely great!",1388620800,,127,5.0
