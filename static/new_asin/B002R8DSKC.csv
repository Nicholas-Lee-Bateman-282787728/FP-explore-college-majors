It is just great, really fast and fun, from the sunrise in Reno to the music to Paul's coaching about race stragegy, nutrition, and other helpful and interesting remarks. This video gets me so excited that I can have trouble pacing myself to the end - I am ready for that sprint!",1350691200,,349,4.223880597014926

And riding along makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the race. Its fast paced and fun. Thanks to these videos, you can feel like you are right there instead of on your stationary bike.",1300406400,,622,9.048387096774194
8378454,5,B002R8DSKC,"I've bought just about every one of this cycling video series.  I train mostly on a stationary trainer for Triathlons.  Kind of freaked out of traveling on the road after being hit by cars and getting major damage (broken bones, road rash, lacerations, etc) from inattentive and impaired car drivers.  These videos give me a feeling of being on the road without the danger.  Plus, they are darn fun to do and the training time goes by really quick.

This is one of my favorites of the series.  You get to race in an exciting and exhilarating competition.  Your heart rate will definately skyrocket on this one and you'll feel like you've accomplished something at the end.  Just love the ending of this one.",1261440000,,707,4.645161290322581
