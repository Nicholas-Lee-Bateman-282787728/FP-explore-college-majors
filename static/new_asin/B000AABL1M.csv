8076869,1,B000AABL1M,"The DVD was title ""FDR, Years of Crisis""

I purchased because I thought it had to do with his dealing with the Depression and especially WWII.  Perhaps if the subtitle was ""Years of Personal Crisis"" I would have looked closer.

As someone who is 67 yrs of age and was born with a birth defect, Spina Bifida, rather severe physical handicap, I laud FDR and I am also one who has always done his best to minimize my physical problems; have held elective office and have always tried to ask for little or no help.

I probably would have not purchased the DVD because I believe that this documentary was done with a PC (politically correct) agenda and was against all that FDR stood for, which is why there are few pixs in which he is seen in a wheelchair, or other aids.

8076870,1,B000AABL1M,"I love history and watch several documentaries and biographies.  This is probably the worst one I have seen.  Basically all it is is speeches and film footage rather than interviews from the experts.  It starts when FDR becomes Assistant Secretary of the Navy and ends when Pearl Harbor is attacked.  The last 10 minutes or so drags on his Supreme Court packing debacle.  Nothing on his early life, Eleanor, World War II, Yalta or the end of his life. To the people of A&E (Biography) PLEASE REMAKE THIS! FDR is too important to have a low budget production like this.",1237248000,6,568,4.64
