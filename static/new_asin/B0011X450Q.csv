8242840,4,B0011X450Q,"When Patty Hearst was kidnapped, apparently I looked just like her.  I was stopped constantly by police, and even was in contact with the FBI about it.  I lived in So Cal, but went to San Francisco for a teacher's conference. I couldn't even get through the airport without being stopped.  So, I was curious to see what she looked like now, and not just in pictures (but in a video).

I actually don't know if we still resemble each other, but the actual movie was worth watching!  I learned quite a bit about San Simeon, and she has narrated it in a personal and interesting style.  Historical facts (trivial as well as significant), numerous photos, and tons of real video footage both old and new, went into the making of the movie.  Is it one I'll watch over and over again?  Probably not.  Was it worth the watch?  Yes.  I'm going to loan it to a friend who worked at San Simeon, so I'm sure it will bring him lots of memories.

It's the kind of movie which belongs in a public library, so after I get it back I'll probably donate it.

Hope this gives you an idea about the movie, along with a special sidenote about being a double for Patty Hearst.",1329955200,2,1154,4.311627906976744
