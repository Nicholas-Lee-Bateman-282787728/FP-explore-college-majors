8733971,3,B015N8JD8I,"I've been a fan of Library War since it first aired all the way back in 2008, and now, thanks to Discotek, more people will be able to enjoy this wonderfully quirky and endearing series. Based on the light novels penned by Hiro Arikawa, the story follows Iku Kasahara as she joins the Library Defense Force and fights along with her fellow librarians against the ruthless censorship efforts of the government sponsored Media Betterment Committee. With tense combat situations, plenty of interpersonal drama, humorous moments and even a hint of romance, this series hits all the right notes for me.

Included in this set are all 12 episodes of the original television series and the OVA special, which adapts the events of the first 3 novels of the original story. Packaging is comprised of two DVDs in a single case along with a slipcover. Episodes 1-6 are on disc 1, and episodes 7-12 plus the special, clean opening and ending are on disc 2. The image quality is okay, but doesn't do the anime justice in my opinion, so if a Blu-ray version is ever released, I'd recommend purchasing that instead.

The only issue I have with this release is the font sizing for the text translations. The overly large font can be a little distracting at best and jarring at worst. For a few early character introductions, the subtitles cover a large portion of the viewing area and obscure characters in the scene to a hilarious degree. I've included a few screenshots to illustrate what it looks like. These seem to be isolated to the first few episodes, though, so it's only a minor annoyance overall and not enough to deter me from recommending this series.

Also, for anyone interested in the movie, which covers the fourth and final novel, the official Japanese Blu-ray release can easily be imported, as it's a Region A disc with English subtitles:

8733974,5,B015N8JD8I,I'll be nice and give it credit because I am in love with this series but there is an error in the description. When it says dubbed in english it should say subtitled because i really thought the series had been finally dubbed after years of waiting. so i was kinda disappointed when i found out there was no english dubbed version.,1449705600,5,332,4.370967741935484
