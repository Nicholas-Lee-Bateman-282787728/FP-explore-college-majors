8525205,4,B008531Y54,"For me, the word that best describes Gabrielle, the film's damaged protagonist, and upon which the entire film hinges, is ambivalent (with some rather serious ""daddy issues"" tossed in for good measure). Her character is a frustrating, enervating one, to be sure. But for me, that was a big part of what made the film brilliant, because it managed to evoke emotions that ranged from empathy to utter disgust. And for a film to be able to evoke such a broad range of emotions is not easy, especially when you consider that there's really no explanation for why she is the way she is (maybe the absence of her father has something to do with it). But there's certainly no logical explanation for why she would continue to love a man who humiliated and abused her -- except for the fact that, for whatever reason, she NEEDED that sort of abuse and humiliation. (And of course, the old: ""The heart loves who/what it loves"".)

And there's always an inherent danger whenever a film portrays that sort of character -- the CHARACTER is unlikable, so then the FILM becomes unlikable because viewers don't like the message that's being portrayed. But that's a mistake in this instance, because the film does an excellent job of capturing the main character's ambivalence to perfection. Furthermore, I was particularly impressed with the way it showed, in the end, Gabrielle choosing to tell the painful truths regarding the lengths she'd gone to please and, in her mind, love Charles. It said to me that maybe, just maybe, she understood the debauchery of what Charles had done to her, and what she'd allowed Charles to do to her, in a different, more realistic light, and that maybe, hopefully, her future choices would be better than her past choices.

So all in all, especially factoring in that this is a French film with French sensibilities, I feel that The Girl Cut In Two is a very good character study on many levels. Is it a perfect film? Hardly. Is it a film worth watching? Yes, IMO, it is. (And I think it's a credit to the director that even though the film centered upon degrading, humiliating sexual acts, there were no gratuitous nude scenes thrown in simply to titillate the audience.) But hey...that's just my 2 cents' worth. As always, your mileage can and will vary.",1359158400,,2276,4.71608040201005
