8082058,4,B000B5XPGU,"""The Galloping Ghost"" is a Mascot serial released in 1931, named for its star, football great Harold ""Red"" Grange.  It was directed by B. Reeves Eason, with screenplay by Helmar Bergman, Ford Beebe and Wyndham Gittens.

Red Grange, known as ""The Galloping Ghost,"" and his roommate Buddy Courtland (Francis X. Bushman, Jr.) are key members of the Clay College football team.  Red is in love with Buddy's sister Barbara (Dorothy Gulliver).  But Buddy is secretly married, against college rules, to Irene (Gwen Lee), a former showgirl whose demands for money drive him to accept a bribe to throw the next game from crooked gamblers, secretly headed by George Elton (Walter Miller), a well-known clubman.  Red finds out about the bribe, knocks Buddy unconscious, and locks him in a boxcar so he will miss the game.  Unfortunately the two gamblers who offered the bribe, Mullins and Brady (Tom London and Ernie Adams) witness Red's treatment of Buddy and report him to coach Harlow (Edward Hearn).  Grange, to avoid implicating Buddy, will not explain his behavior so he is taken off the team.  Buddy, in a hospital in a nearby town, is about to reveal who the gamblers are when he is knocked on the head and loses his memory.  Irene, who wants to blackmail the gamblers, spirits Buddy away with the help of a mysterious cripple (Theodore Lorch), who seems to be a dangerous enemy of both Red and his roommate.  Red has to clear himself of the bribery charge, and uncover the leader of the gamblers.

The serial was made fairly early in the sound era and it shows, mostly in the lack of background music and occasional overacting, though the main cast seems free of any serious microphone discomfort.  Grange was no actor, but does well in the action scenes and delivers his lines better than ""Slingin' Sammy"" Baugh did ten years later in ""King of the Texas Rangers.""  It is fortunate that his roommate suffers memory loss, limiting comparison of acting abilities.  Theodore Lorch, best known for his role as the second High Priest in the 1936 ""Flash Gordon"" serial, in which he strikes the gong waking the Sacred Fire Dragon, is delightfully over-the-top as the ""mysterious cripple,"" whose evil laughter is heard during the ""next week"" titles, and reliable bad guys Ernie Adams and Tom London do their boss' bidding with enthusiasm.  The ""comic relief"" by Tom Dugan and Frank Brownlee is no better than expected, though Dugan does a far better job than he did in ""The Phantom of the West,"" here as Grange's friend Jerry, a stuttering cabbie.

The plot lacks logic, but nothing unusual for a Mascot serial so we have an old house that gets bombed at one point, yet is used again by the ""mysterious cripple"" a couple chapters later.  There is no explanation of how Buddy will be allowed to return to the football team, given that he is married.  His wife, Irene, just vanishes for the last couple chapters, a shame since her character actually shows some development.  There are a few ""flashbacks"" with reuse of footage from earlier chapters, but not as many as in other Mascot serials of the era.

Alpha's DVD edition, ALP 4904D is on a single disc.  The same edit of the serial, and possibly the same source print is used for both Alpha's DVD and VCI's old VHS release, # 1748.  The two are similar in picture and sound quality, and while Alpha adds their logo to the opening and closing titles, they keep it out of the rest of the film.  The image is adequately sharp, well-framed and while more than a little high in contrast, faces lose detail but don't usually go blank.  Some ""white dirt"" is present, especially in the titles, but the chapters themselves are better.  The sound is not too bad for a 1931 Mascot serial, and without excessive dynamic range compression so the background hiss remains at a fairly-low level.  A couple short pieces of the film are missing that were present in the otherwise dreadful edition once issued by Video Yesteryear.  The first chapter lacks an ""ethnic"" humor routine from Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones as a football fan -- no great loss, but a slight misrepresantation of the film.  Worse, in Chapter Four, Buddy has been abducted after losing his memory.  The ""mysterious cripple"" starts pulling out his brain-surgery implements, but a piece of film was spliced out where he explains, ""I...am going to let a little daylight into his soul"" and, when Irene objects, ""What do you care what happens to him?  YOU don't love him!""  Also missing is a short piece where a shadow on the wall shows that the cripple is threatening Buddy's sister.  Were these parts considered too scary?  Still, the omissions are relatively few.

The serial will appeal most to those tolerant of early sound-era films.  Allowing a day or so between chapters helps minimize the repetition and plot disconnects.  The film print isn't pristine, but Alpha's DVD is better than most of their editions of Mascot serials, and sold at a bargain price.",1323820800,6,4949,4.774383078730905
8082059,2,B000B5XPGU,"This was nothing more than a vehicle for a football superstar.  Hollywood did the same for a few other sports figures, such as, Babe Ruth, with much the same results.  Red Grange was a great halfback at the University of Illinois--he once scored four touchdowns against favored Michigan in 12 minutes.  But he couldn't act a lick.  It's downright shameful what the director allowed to happen.  But if it's any consolation, none of the others in this serial could act any better.  This is just a clumsy piece of work.

The story is thin, simplistic (not simple, simplistic).  Red Grange is the star player for a fictional college.  When his friend and teammate takes a bribe to fix a game, Red goes into action and ends up accused of taking a bribe himself before being expelled from the college.  There's lots of fast action, chases, fistfights gallore with no one hurt, wrecked vehicles, daring leaps over embankments, even falling out of an airplane.  Eventually, of course, all turns out OK, because Red is not only a great halfback, he has a sterling character.  The gamblers are thwarted and integrity, where justified, is maintained.

There are a few good things, such as, marvelous views of Los Angeles streets, scenes long since gone; views of football games from another era; cars, planes, streetcars of the early Great Depression; the snicker of the ""cripple"" at the end of each episode.  I'm not sure why I liked that cruel laugh, but I did.",1189382400,6,1452,4.779116465863454
8082060,4,B000B5XPGU,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

""The Galloping Ghost"" was a famous early 1920s gridiron nickname given by a sportswriter to Univ. of Illinois footballer Harold 'Red' Grange. Red's most remarkable exploit came in a 1924 game against Michigan, when he returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and went on to score three more times in the first quarter!

Upon answering Hollywood's call in 1931, Grange quickly proved that as an actor he was a superb running back. In spite of his somewhat wooden delivery, this 12-part serial named after Grange really isn't that bad, thanks to a good supporting cast and script (by Ford Beebe).

THE STORY: Gamblers try to prevent Red and Buddy from playing in games they want to ""fix.""
