8447857,4,B001GATF86,"Faust

Fascinating 1926 silent film by director F.W. Murnau, about Faust and his deal with the devil.  The imagery was pretty gloomy and surreal as we start out with the three evil horsemen representing war, famine and plague.  The angel (or God) wants to know why the devil is throwing this all at Man.  At this time the devil wagers that he can take a very devout man, Faust, and turn him against God.  God says if he does that, then Earth is his.  What a deal!

The large wings of the devil over the little German town where Faust lives is powerful imagery.  Faust is implored upon to help stop the plague which the devil is causing.  Half the town is dying.  Faust goes into despair as his remedies don't work, knowledge doesn't work and so on.

Finally, he burns the Bible!  But just when it's turning to ash, he finds a clue in the burnt pages and summons the devil.  The devil makes him a deal -- be ""king for a day"" so to speak and Faust will be able to cure the plague.

Things turn out pretty well for some time until Faust finds it hard to look upon a holy cross.  Who can blame him?  It is a sign of his betrayal.  The people who at first adored him now want to stone him (talk about ungracious!).

Faust now wishes suicide rather than going on like this.  The devil stops him and says hey, the day is not up yet (per the hour glass).  The devil gives him good looks, a great woman from Parma and everything is just peachy.  Even a magic carpet ride!

The second half of the film deals with Faust's inability to handle the deal.  First he decides to do the deal to eternity rather than a day.  Then he finds a girl who goes to church and is chaste and he wants her.  The devil is not keen on this idea but continues  with it.

The movie slows for me a bit at this point.  I get that Faust is having trouble with his deal and is trying to work around it.  But the film drags at some points, like when we meet the girls' mom and brother Valentin.

I must say the acting is quite well done and sometimes dramatic but that's expected.  Film was new in these days and stage was its template.  But Murnau understood how film works and used the medium to the max, with lights, fire, shadow, superimposition of film, creating a magic such as disappearing bodies and such, that made for some fine entertainment.

The DVD was borrowed from Netflix and did not indicate who put it to DVD -- not Kino, for sure.  The quality was fair, not as clean as I've seen in Kino versions of other silents.  There is a photo gallery and scene selection but nothing special, no features, so it gets a star subtracted due to quality.

Recommended, especially for fans of Murnau and German Expressionism.

I was extremely excited when I ordered this and when i watched it extremely disappointed.  Once again, do not buy this product unless you can read German!",1256256000,6,407,4.625
8447860,5,B001GATF86,"I think of Murnau's Faust as a masterpiece not only of cinema, but of the human imagination. I understand that reviews at the time of its premier were lukewarm, but I honestly can't imagine not feeling grateful for the opportunity to see this film today. Moments and images from it are so powerful, they are vivid in the mind years after seeing them -- two hours in a dream world.

The flying sequence has been commented-on more than once, and with good reason. It is a spectacular series of shots wherein the camera tracks through long miniature sets which gradually change from a dense cluster of medieval rooftops and steeples, to a tortuous countryside of mountain peaks and snake-like rivers, twisted trees, deep gorges with plunging waterfalls and stone cliffs, rapids, a field of long grass, elaborate renaissance architecture and an Italianate palace. Along the way there is an encounter with grotesque elongated black birds in the sky, their wings flapping in unison. The sets incorporate running water (with little bits of smoking material floating in the rapids to simulate splashes and spray), an illuminated moon, and smoke to simulate clouds and fog. The whole sequence can't be much more than a couple of minutes long, but the effort to design, construct and coordinate the sequence must have been staggering. The following palace scene is set on a huge multi-level set with female dancers stretching off into the distance. They are there for no better reason than to establish an atmosphere of sumptuous decadence, and young Faust arrives in the middle of this riding between two enormous elephants, which seem to be entirely artificial and crafted of fabric, wire, etc. So it goes throughout the production. Almost every scene is a feast for the eyes, and the darker scenes are vividly expressionistic in design.

The acting is the old-fashioned silent-movie variety of big operatic gestures and vivid facial expression. It may seem odd to those not used to it, but it is NOT an example of ham actors overdoing it. This was a legitimate style of acting in its time, and offers genuine artistic beauty to those who can manage to appreciate it.",1226188800,,2159,4.9449035812672175
8447861,5,B001GATF86,This is the second copy of Faust that I have purchased.  I bought mine from the reseller because it was cheaper and because the last version I bought was a bargain bin version that was sub-standard to say the least.  This version is well worth the 12 bucks I paid for it.  Picture and sound quality are good with alot of the popping sounds gone.,1224720000,,345,4.276923076923077
8447862,5,B001GATF86,"Cinematically this is a triumph of black and white cinematography. What is done with light and shadow is consistently amazing - mind-boggling for its time. Carl Hoffmann brilliantly creates a world of shades and shadows for these timeless myths to unfold against. Unfortunately, the narrative is very ponderous and slowly paced - one is reminded of Wagner's PARSIFAL in its concept and its execution. The love story between the young Faust and his Gretchen repeats itself over and over until one has to shut off the story and just concentrate on the visuals. Jannings is a stand-out as the sly and conniving Mephisto. The rest of the cast is merely adequate. Future director William Dieterle is not memorable as Gretchen's brother. This is a hard film to sit through but worth it for Murnau fans and for fans of cinematography. It is certainly a visual masterwork.",1223942400,,864,4.924657534246576
8447863,5,B001GATF86,"F.W. Murnau's telling of the classic German legend, 'Faust' is a masterpiece to behold. From both the technical and story standpoint, the film excels and despite being nearly eighty years old, Faust still stands tall as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. F.W. Murnau has become best known among film fans for 'Nosferatu', but this is unfair to the man. While Nosferatu is something of an achievement; it pales in comparison to this film in every respect. Faust is far more extravagant than Murnau's vampire tale, and it shows his technical brilliance much more effectively. The story is of particular note, and it follows a German alchemist by the name of Faust. As God and Satan war over Earth, the Devil preaches that he will be able to tempt Faust into darkness and so has a wager with God to settle things. Satan sends Mephisto to Earth to offer Faust an end to the plague that is making it's way through the local population, and eternal youth, in return for Faust's soul...

The way that Murnau creates the atmosphere in the film is nothing short of amazing. The lighting and use of shadows is superb, and helps to create a strong sense of dread at the same time as making the film incredibly easy on the eyes. It's the music that's the real star of the show, however, as it's absolutely fantastic and easily ranks up with the greatest scores ever written. The scenery is expressionistic and gives the film a strong sense of beauty (which is increased by the excellent cinematography), especially in the darker scenes; all of which are an absolute delight to behold. The story is undoubtedly one of the most important ever written, and within it is themes of good, evil, religion and most importantly, love. The points are never hammered home, and instead they are allowed to emancipate from the centre of the tale, which allows the audience to see them for themselves rather than being told; and that's just the way a story should be.

It's hard to rate the acting in silent cinema as being a member of a modern audience, I'm used to actors acting with dialogue and judging a performance without that is difficult. However, on the other hand; silent acting is arguably more difficult than acting with dialogue as the only way to portray your feelings to the audience is through expressions and gestures, and in that respect; acting is just another area where this film excels. In fact, there isn't an area that this film doesn't excel in and for that reason; it easily ranks up with the greatest films ever committed to the screen.",1223337600,,2559,4.697104677060134
