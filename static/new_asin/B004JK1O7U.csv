4391061,5,B004JK1O7U,"Garbo & Gable - what more do you need to know?!?
OK, here's a little more......
Their one & only time starring together in a movie.
Neither were particularly impressed with each other off camera.
You would NEVER know that watching the movie!
If you like either one, you should like Susan Lenox.
If you like both, you're in for a treat!!",1389657600,3,336,4.435483870967742
4391062,4,B004JK1O7U,"You know, to be as beautiful as Greta Garbo was meant she was going to do plenty of suffering throughout most of her movies. Here she plays a girl from the wrong side of the farm plow  ""promised"" to Sven or was Alan Hale Named Monstro?
Anyway she escapes the role as farm drudge and runs out into the night to stumble across the bungalow belonging to Clark Gable. He takes her in for the night with no funny business (although he certainly considers it) but his German Shepard plays the police dog and stands guard over Gret.
Greta and Clark's characters fall on love but when Greta's forced fiance shows up after Clark leaves town for a few days, Greta/Susan is forced to run off again.
This time she lands in a tawdry carnival and becomes the owner's main squeeze bly night while she has to shimmy and dance the seven veils by day.
Clark's character finds her and of course as this was 1930, de does not believe her story about her dad and Monstro trying to force her to marriage once Clark had left her for those few days.
The last few scenes show how Greta turns her life around by joining a broadway dance troupe and being ""discovered"" by a wealthy. business man
She finds out Clark is out of work and has one of her boyftiend's wealthy associates offer him a job if he (Clark) will meet him later that night.
Greta show up instead.
The setting shifts to a south sea bar where Greta is dancing while searching for Clark Gable. They do end up together in the end of the movie.",1374624000,4,1480,4.323741007194244

4391064,3,B004JK1O7U,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""SUSAN LENOX:HER FALL & RISE"" (1931) (76 min/B&W) -- Starring: Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Jean Hersholt, John Miljan, Alan Hale, Hale Hamilton, Hilda Vaughn

Directed by Robert Z. Leonard

The plot and story line: -- Susan (Greta Garbo), an orphan, lives the life of Cinderella with rustic relatives. She escapes one stormy night when the fiance her relatives chose to force his attentions. Rodney (Clark Gable), an architect, is the prince who rescues her, but he has to take a trip and the wicked relatives catch up with her again.

Susan Lenox is one heavy handed melodrama and no one would remember it at all today, but for the fact it was the one and only teaming of Gable and Garbo. Being paired with Garbo was a big milestone for Clark Gable. Also he was not paying thugs any longer, charismatic thugs, but thugs nonetheless. He was leading man material after this film.

It started off great, especially in the cinematography department. Greta Garbo looked captivating and there was Clark Gable, sans famous mustache.

The second half signaled a decline as the film turned into a sappy melodrama and finished on a incredibly bad note -- Jean Hersholt and John Miljan provided able supporting help but, in the end, was disappointing.

Garbo gives weight and importance to a character that's not easy to play, forced to do unpleasant things - all this beautifully played by Garbo.

Gable is good but his character is a little too dense to be likable - he should have been a bit more understanding about Susan's circumstances and her background.  He will later on in his career display compassion, which was his trademark.

Their chemistry is excellent but the film itself is quite poor - it was almost unwatchable. Only for fans of the two stars.

* Special Footnote: -- This film marked the only teaming of Greta Garbo and Clark Gable, when she was an established star and he a promising young actor whom the studio had just signed. Reportedly, they did not get along well, Garbo considering Gable vulgar and he seeing her as stuck-up and remote.

4391065,5,B004JK1O7U,"The campy, often corny, pre-code ""Susan Lenox"" has finally received a DVD release at last and I am thrilled as it is my favorite Garbo film.  This movie shows off a young and beautiful Garbo in a contemporary role for the 1930's as she later went on to play mostly tragic heroines from the past. It is interersting to me for this reason. But, I don't want to mislead anyone, ""Susan Lenox"" is not a particularly good film and it certainly is not the first movie I would look to if I wanted a real appreciation for Garbo as an actress, she had much better material to work with in other films. In fact this movie is just plain weird most of the time- mostly due to some strange dialogue and scenarios (see Garbo\Gable fishing scene). BUT, that being said, It's just good fun to see the Great Greta Garbo slumming it for awhile as a girl on the run turns carny hooker!!! I mean does it get much better than that?! For this reason alone I love this film! If you're a Garbo fan, as I am, you'll love it too.",1313193600,9,1002,4.21875
4391066,5,B004JK1O7U,"I saw this movie about 25 years ago in a retro-theater in  New York City. It is a must-see, if only for Clark Gable's naked face. And if you ever wondered why Garbo was such a big star, see this movie.",1298246400,6,201,3.902439024390244
