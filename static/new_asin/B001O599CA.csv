8329681,5,B001O599CA,"Love radiates in full splendor for at least one eternity in Franco Zeffirelli's cinematic `high romance' adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""; first showcased in 1968 and has since grown in stature as an artistic classic of the first order. Superior performances by Olivia Hussey (eternally young and optimistic Juliet), Leonard Whiting (impassioned and headstrong Romeo), Milo O'Shea (the ill-advised Friar Laurence), Michael York (hot-tempered, resentful Tybalt, aka `the Prince of Cats'), and John McEnery (moody, melancholic, sharp-tongued, and self-effacing Mercutio) and a superb cast and film crew (your work is remarkable in this film; wherever you are: Thank you!) - made all the difference in this remake. Previous attempts had faltered because the actor and actress - selected to play our teenage couple - were in fact ""a wee bit too old and not quite believable' for the parts but too famous `to deny the roles to'; such is the cinema history leading up to this production, a box office and commercial hit in its day. So brilliant was this adaption - that it has remained a definitive, high octane rendition of an age-old tale of youthful love, passion, intimacy, misjudgement, unleashed anger resulting in death, poetic justice, and a roller-coaster ride of dramatic irony and intent - that to this day - reminds us that 15 year olds can stir up considerable unsubtle dramatic tragedy on any given day. It almost takes your breath away!

We yearn for another drop of passion from this cinematic play about tragic love gone asunder. Each viewing - like a glass of dry, delicious Italian wine - drops onto the tongue and perhaps encourages - yet another viewing of this ageless classic. And those long kisses...how could they reveal so much? All unities adhered to. So many dramatic ironies one needs a magnifying glass to reveal which layer of irony superimposed upon another one. So much nuance one yields to the temptation to take another look at this fascinating work of art.

Please see my review of the motion picture ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (1993) when it is finished. Thank you for your patience.",1332720000,,2126,5.036931818181818
