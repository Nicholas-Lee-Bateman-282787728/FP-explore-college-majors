6561704,5,B00M6BAVH8,"Loved it. It was cute, and funny. I felt I was watching two rom com at once. Loved that there were two stories, at the same time. feels like love won twice. :) The plus was seeing Quintana Roo and the Mayan community, the jungle/underwater cave. I am glad I bought the movie.",1495843200,,275,4.2075471698113205

6561706,1,B00M6BAVH8,"The movie is really bad, and I am trying to say it on a way it does not offend or at least respect Amazon guidelines for reviews. As a production it lacks of structure. From the very beginning you notice that there is something wrong, poorly written, poorly acted, you will just loose your money. Whatever silly US movie is better that this one... And it is so sad to me, because there are so many good emergent directors and producers that would do magic with such opportunity.",1494720000,,478,4.443181818181818

6561713,1,B00M6BAVH8,"I enjoy Mexican films especially comedies but this one was not good. It was really cheesy, had an unrealistic but predictable story line, the female lead actress was obnoxious, and it plainly was not funny. Disappointed.",1483747200,,220,5.138888888888889

6561731,5,B00M6BAVH8,"I love this movie! I also discovered it from Redbox and I'm so glad I decided to give it a try.  It's your standard rom com but wonderfully done.  The cinematography is beautiful and I loved seeing the forest scenery.  It was a lot funnier than I expected to be; there's a nice balance of obvious, slapstick-y comedic moments and comedic moments that are quieter and more subtle (which made them even funnier!).  Now that I own the DVD I've watched this movie again and again, it's awesome.",1462752000,,490,4.534090909090909
