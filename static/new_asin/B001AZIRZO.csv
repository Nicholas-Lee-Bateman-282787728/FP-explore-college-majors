3476878,5,B001AZIRZO,"Beauty And The Beast - Complete Series , is without a doubt the best TV show box set of the year, It is great to have all the episodes in one very nice box. The extras , like Vincent's poetry would be another CD to buy , but it is included in this box set. I would have liked them to clean it up ( video ) and remaster  the audio in 5.1 , but hey atleast we have a really good set. Always enjoyed the show and just recently my vcr ate one my my vhs tapes , so this was great timing for the box set to be released. If your a fan , it is a must buy.",1224806400,7,547,3.520661157024793
3476879,5,B001AZIRZO,"I read the other reviews of this DVD set and I disagree that it is not worth the money. I dearly loved this show when it came out, so much so that I could not even bear to watch the last season after Catherine died. It is only now I can find the courage to watch the final season and still I cried.
I agree the cover is not the Vincent we loved, but as was the heart of this series, it is not what something is on the outside that is important, it's what's inside. And what I found inside is disk after disk of girlhood memories. When the show was on originally, my TV reception was terrible and so I could not even see all of the episodes or savior the scenes as I can now on DVD.

It was a beautiful show and none since have come close to matching the passion of it.

I was shocked at first when I heard the voice reading the ""reconstructed love letters"". My heart sank that it was not Vincent's voice. However when I listened to it again, I think that it is Ron Perlman's voice. In the original readings for the sound track, I have read that he wore the mask while reading the poetry so it would sound like him. This many years later, I doubt that was a possibility. Listen without anger and see if anyone agrees that this is Ron's voice, not as Vincent, but as he is today.",1224028800,51,1277,4.043478260869565
3476880,4,B001AZIRZO,"This series has gotten me through some dark times!  I have watched all of season one and find I have to return the whole set!  I am so disappointed several of the DVD's appear to be damaged. During some of the episodes scenes will freeze and ""digital?"" squares corrupt the scene. I did not pay for damaged scenes! This series is way to important!
I haven't tried the extra features yet, I expected more of them though. Artwork could be better!",1223251200,10,443,4.45679012345679
3476881,3,B001AZIRZO,"As a huge fan of the show, I am truly disappointed. I gave my DVD sets to another fan in anticipation of the full series set, but it just wasn't worth it.

The interactive trivia feature is fun for about ten minutes. The questions were ultimately pretty easy and could have been written by some disinterested intern who just skimmed over episodes. It was kind of bumpy and not very engaging.

The original love letters are nothing new, but I too was shocked when some strange man started reading the new love letters. I mean, what were they thinking? No fan of the show wants to hear some random guy reading Vincent's words. I immediately pressed Stop and have no interest in checking out the rest.

The experience reached an all-new low when I started reading the love letters and noticed two typos in one letter. I am an editor and look for these things, but I am pretty sure any person with a brain knows that solace is spelled with an ""a"" and not solice, like they spelled it. And ""breath"" instead of ""breathe""? Come on! Again, who put this together?

It's obvious that Ron and Linda (or anybody close to the show) had nothing to do with this box set, which is disappointing. No love was put into this at all - the abominable picture of Vincent on the cover symbolizes all that is wrong with this box set. When I think of the features on other DVD sets, I feel ripped off and let down. Why can't we see deleted scenes, interviews, and other cool bonus features?

The fans of this show are really connected to it - the mailing lists, conferences, fan fiction, etc. are still going strong twenty-one years later and this box set is just a slap in the face. If you don't have all the seasons, get this because it's cheaper than buying them separately. But if you already have the seasons, don't bother with this. It will only disappoint you.",1222905600,193,1842,4.437869822485207
3476882,3,B001AZIRZO,"If you've already purchased the show's three seasons separately, don't bother with the boxed set, as it's a complete waste of money.

In addition to the strangely altered image of Vincent on the box, the ""bonus"" disc is insulting to long-time fans. ""Newly Reconstructed Love Letters"" is read by God-knows-who ... certainly not Ron Perlman. Ridiculous. If you bought the VHS tapes way back when, you already have the original love letters, which also appear on the bonus disc.

Besides the love letters, the only other two features are episodic promos for some first season episodes - and ""Vincent's Quest"" - an interactive trivia game. No interviews, no deleted scenes, no behind-the-scenes footage ... nothing to warrant spending $70 if you've already purchased all three seasons individually.

What a disappointment.",1222732800,161,818,5.276923076923077
3476883,2,B001AZIRZO,"I'm confused, the show I remember starred Ron Perlman and
Linda Hamilton and even the really bad cover does look like
them.",1222732800,10,123,4.636363636363637
3476884,3,B001AZIRZO,"As an aging, white, heteosexual, incurably romamtic male who has been watching TV since the late 1950s, I think BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was the best show ever - with a caveat of the first two seasons only. For all you ""BEASTIES"" out there, the logical cover would have been the painting at the end of WHEN THE BLUE BIRD SINGS from season two. (By the way - does anyone know where I can get a print of that painting?)If you folks remember when we could only get Season # 1 on VHS, some of them had Vincent's lost Love Letters to Catherine. I suspect they put those in. Despite being read by Ron Pearlman, they were tripe. The CD was wonderful.",1222473600,39,639,4.245901639344262
3476885,5,B001AZIRZO,"For those people who loved the series, the three Seasons were purchased seperately as they were released. I would really like to know about the extras that will be included or I can't see myself putting out the money for a boxed set. Also, whoever did the artwork did a horrible job. It's a disgrace to the show that the person didn't spend enough time searching for a decent picture when there are so many to choose from. I hope this isn't just a thrown together set to make more money...I truly hope that some time and thought was put into the compilation to show the respect that the loyal fans deserve.",1221436800,13,606,4.419642857142857
3476886,5,B001AZIRZO,"I'm sorry but I have to say it.  That cover is the ugliest photoshopping of Vincent's face that I have ever seen.  I fail to see why they had to take what was beautiful and make it into something unrecognizable. Either don't mess with the photos or give it to someone who knows the character.

As with Season 2 I am sure we will come up with some way to cover this version with something more palatable.

When will we know what the ""extras"" are?",1216166400,22,445,4.2

I admit I am totally amazed at the make-up on Vincent.  It is so perfect that even the close-ups are amazing.
I can't imagine how many hours it took to make him up each day of filming.
Congrats. to the make-up team from that show.  That was make-up not computer generated.

3476933,4,B001AZIRZO,"I remember seeing the first season of the show and it left a good impression on me.  It was just nice to see a tv program where the story shows that beauty is found within and not what is just on the surface and that love, trust, and compassion, etc. are what really matters. It is kinda cheesy in some parts but still leaves you with a good feeling.  The first dvd I received was new but had a few scratches in the first few dvds that made it difficult to watch; however, once I contacted Amazon about an exchange, I received a replacement extremely fast.  There are a some scratches but way better than the first one and overall I am satisfied with this purchase.",1429920000,,665,4.261904761904762

This is one of my favorites and I really enjoy Linda Hamilton's acting,  Ron Perlman is very compassionate and sensitive in this role.  A helpful bit of advise about this DVD set...the discs will only run on older model DVD players.  I was able to play the dvds on my portable DVD player which was purchased back in the 80s, when DVD Players were popular.  Worth the investment if you enjoy heart-warming stories on older DVD players.",1427068800,3,559,4.595959595959596

3477054,5,B001AZIRZO,"My only complaint with this series is that it wasn't long enough! Ron Pearlman melted our hearts as Vincent, the ever poetic and gentle beast as he wooed Katherine and protected her with his life. It's a shame this series couldn't have made ore seasons because I have a feeling they would have been phenomenal!",1402358400,,310,4.654545454545454

3477080,1,B001AZIRZO,"First, I've read responses to poor reviews where the respondent was upset that the reviewer gave a low rating because of the defective DVDs in this set, instead of rating the actual content/quality of the series.  Sorry, but when I read reviews, I do so in order to help me decide whether or not to buy an item.  That said, this box set gets 1 star from me, and I'd give it zero stars if that were an option.  As far as the actual show goes, I loved, loved, loved the first two seasons.  Catherine and Vincent were wonderful characters and I'm not ashamed to admit I was madly in love with Vincent.  I think the series should have ended with Catherine's departure.  That said, here's why I would not recommend buying this set:  Like several other reviewers, my DVDs had multiple defects. Some discs would suddenly stop playing. Others would skip to later scenes. Some wouldn't play at all.  In some cases I could only watch an episode by fast forwarding to later scenes and going backwards through the episode to earlier scenes.  Not an enjoyable way to watch a show.  The seller has been wonderful!  They sent me a new set and a return label for the first set. Unfortunately, the second set has technical problems as well.  If the seller offers a third set, I'm not sure I'll want to go through the headache and waste-of-time involved in checking each disc again.  Such a huge disappointment!",1396656000,2,1393,4.546184738955823
3477081,5,B001AZIRZO,"I loved this series on television. I watched it every night with my wife. I get emotional even thinking about it. Back then she and I was very much in love. This series captured the essence of what true love really meant. We believed in our love the same way and communicated through our third eye much like Vincent & Catherine. The episode about Lover lost impacted us and I never will forget that episode. We were shocked and stunned. But the message of death having no dominion was clear a powerful. Unfortunately a few years later, I was placed in a position where I truly understood what it meant. My wife Shelia G. Wheeler went to glory and the words of this show never left me. The magic and spirituality of it all kept me strong. That was 1991. I was 32 at the time. At 57 I can honestly say though lovers be lost, love never is. I have to stop writing because i am about to cry. But get this series and you will understand what true love really is.",1396396800,,957,4.2349726775956285

However I must be honest and say I always stop watching the show once Catherine dies (1st episode, 3rd season). I refuse to watch anything after.

One thing: The box cover of Vincent looks ridiculous. Doesn't look like him at all in my opinion.",1386633600,,376,4.295774647887324

I bought series 1 and 2 from amazon.com some years ago and love it. But am so pleased I got series 3 in my opinion its the best of the 3 series as there is more action and Vincent is magnificent. I love all the episodes but 2 of them are outstanding and my fovourites which are ""A time to heal"" and ""In the forests of the night""  absolutely brilliant.

3477143,5,B001AZIRZO,"Beauty and the Beast DVDS come in a box set, and whilst all of us fans were not too happy how they made Vincent look, the inside of the season 1, 2 and 3 are lovely decorated with images of the cast and roses, beautifully done. However, the down side would be that the letters to Catherine are NOT read by Vincent, aka Ron Perlman...instead some other guy doing the reading which is in no way a compliment to Vincent or the series.
It is always wonderful to sit and watch again and again the series one season after another and enjoy this timeless show which is filled with a gothic romance, a warmth, of family, of love and of hope, of trust, and compassion, of loyalty, of unity, of a journey taken.

Beauty and the Beast is very much alive in ways of fandom, and of conventions each year, and we keep the dream alive for Vincent and Catherine and the tunnels, we hope ONE DAY for a release of this show onto Blu Ray.

It's a deplorable joke. And that's being kind at every turn. The video image is honestly no better than VHS quality. And is virtually unwatchable on a flat screen television due to the conflict of low resolution video to high def technology. There was virtually no care given in creating this box set. And quite honestly, I have seen higher standards given to cartoons released from the 60's. For such a magnificent series, CBS Video did a deplorable job releasing this material in such thoughtless fashion. If you have second hand copies of this series, keep your money and watch those.

It amazes me to see how a ""beast"" can be more human than we are! Sometimes we need to learn from others to find our way back.
 I was sorry to see the show end on tv  too, but I think it ran the course. It is almost easy to forget the violence involved in the show and sometimes, it just shatters your heart.

Very good for the time it was aired (80's).  The make-up is pretty good, also.  Many of the episodes in the first and second seasons are individual shows, with some ""cases"" being revisited later in each season.  There are also some returning characters.

3477187,4,B001AZIRZO,"I remember catching this series by accident in the 80's when other series (The Equalizer for one) were returning to New York for location shooting, probably in the second season, and I fell under its spell. To me, it wasn't about The Beast (Ron Perlman) or The Beauty (Linda Hamilton)so much as the working out of the romantic/contemplative life versus the ordinary/business life. And, to me, the writers had it worked out that this country was heading for a bumpy ride promoting the notion that you could ""have it all."" Catherine,(lawyer Linda Hamilton) has everyday problems above ground always solved by going below ground, of course, with her soul-mate, Vincent. In the course of the episodes they both learn from one another. In no time I looked forward to going beneath the city to the lair/library of those living the contemplative ""underground"" life. There was a wonderful build-up to earn your peek into this underground world. And what this series says about the advantages of reading alone, solitude as opposed to loneliness, leading to self-assurance, self-esteem etc. must have influenced many other devotees. The series also emphasized the voice and elocution in a very subtle way. When you think about it, this series anticipated libraries facing extinction, at least to the outside (above ground) city. The voice of Ron Perlman and the art direction are essential to the credibility of this fable, held together with the paternal wisdom of Vincent's ""Father"" Roy Dotrice. I was disappointed in the last season where I think they went wrong story-wise, but the series hits it on the nail bringing literature, philosophy (Emersonian or others)alive beneath the troubled city and in the hearts of Vincent and Catherine, if only our politicians were so inspired.",1358640000,,1774,5.120689655172414

3477193,5,B001AZIRZO,"I have wanted the entire series of Beauty and the Beast for ages. This Christmas, I bought it for myself. I'm old enough to have seen it when it was on TV, and immediately fell in love with it. Like any show, there are some episodes that aren't that interesting, but most are phenomenal. I don't know if this was Ron Perlman's first time in a role requiring such a physical change,but his still being able to act and create the unique voice for ""Vincent""was outstanding work. Linda Hamilton was a good choice for Catherine, because she wasn't just another pretty face. The character she created had a gentleness, and fierceness when needed especially over Vincent. I loved watching their friendship slowly change into romantic love. The ""Beast"" was supposed to be frightening, but I would say only startling at first glance. I always thought Vincent was incredibly sexy. Truly my favorite show.

From a nearly three season run (a 3rd season had begun, but had only three episodes before cancellation), there were only two that I hadn't taped. Yes, back in the days when the ""VCR"" was still relatively new, I taped the series. You could do that back then, but not invite a houseful of people over and charge admission. However, 25 year-old VHS tapes don't hold a candle to modern DVD's. Actually, it was a total of 5 episodes, because back then, I didn't know that there was a Season 3, with a few episodes. There had been no advertising, and it wasn't shown until months later. Now, I finally got to see them. Although the show has long ended, a new generation might be able to enjoy the series. What's interesting is there are websites all over, with former viewers keeping the show going, mostly the love between Catherine and Vincent, by writing countless short stories. I think this series can teach people how to love the person inside, and not cast them away for their exterior.",1357084800,3,1884,4.691842900302115

3477204,3,B001AZIRZO,"Loved season 1 and 2 when the show was on TV. Hated and stopped watching season 3. Was happy to get this set with all 3 seasons once the price dropped to $25, but am disappointed in the ""no frills"" aspect of this DVD set.

There's no subtitles for starters. I have trouble hearing at times, so I often watch shows and films with the subtitle option turned on. - No such option with these. You're on your own. There's also no chapter menus per episode, and no settings menu of any kind. Basically, the disks seem to have 4 episodes each, you click ""Play All"" and watch all 4 episodes in a row (unless you pause or stop). There's no other settings or menu options.

For the reduced price, I may keep this. I would never pay more though, and am still debating returning the set.

So, for the tv show itself, 2 out of 3 seasons were good in my opinion. For the ""Complete Series DVD Set"" I'm giving it a 3 so far. Works ok, but this is really a bare bones ""no frills"" set that's lacking basic ""DVD"" options and functionality. I don't have any of the single season sets, but I'd be curious to know if those DVDs were better made.

ADDING TO MY REVIEW:

I've now watched the entire box set.

Season 2 is much better than season 1 acting wise. Far less sappy. And I don't hate season 3 as much as I did before :) (maybe it's an age thing ;) - I also intentionally skipped ""though lovers be lost"" so that helps!)

Each disk in Season 2 has one episode that has in intro by Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton. That was a nice  surprise.

The third season has one dedicated ""bonus"" disk that's pretty lame. There's love letters, some read by Ron Perlman and some read by some other guy. There's a quiz that's dressed up as a ""Quest to find Catherine"" but it's just a quiz with some quick snippets of episodes, and animation between each question that looks like you're going through tunnels. There's also copies of some of the commercials/promos that aired way back when. - And I think that's it. (I may be missing something, but if I am, it clearly wasn't that memorable!) There's no interviews other than the ones I mentioned on the Season 2 disks. There's no behind the scenes or ""making of"" videos. It really is a pretty bare bones set.

Quality-wise, I'll add that a LOT of my disks had debris or light scratches on them. Right out of the box! Before I did anything! And by debris I mean not only dust and particles, but small bits that were stuck to the disk. Stuck enough that I had to use some force to get the bits off and was worried I'd damage the disk in doing so.

Despite the light scratches and debris, all my disks played well except one, which worked ok once I cleaned it really well. I certainly believe all the other reviews where people said their disks didn't play at all.

I've had DVDs for years that I never scratched at ALL, so it's unacceptable to me to get a brand NEW set of DVDs with light scratches or debris stuck on many of the disks - Even if they did play ok for me. I was sent a replacement set and was able to swap out SOME of my disks for better ones, but in several cases, the disks I wanted to swap ALSO had debris and/or light scratches in the new set! Since I knew my set at least played, I kept the imperfect ones I had.

As I said previously in my review, get this on sale! The lack of subtitles is still a huge issue for me, and with the lack of other extras and the poor physical quality of the disks, it's just not worth paying top dollar for this collection. The episodes themselves, however, are fine. If you're a fan of the show and just want to watch it again, this is good enough - WHEN it's on sale! :)",1353801600,6,3639,4.1814285714285715

with a modern twist of the classic French fairy tale that is more of the Beast that becomes human of love that is earned & recived in return.

3477219,5,B001AZIRZO,"Thanks to Netflix, my 21 year old self discovered this lovely series. By the time I was born this show had already been cancelled, and I had never seen it re-aired on television. I have always loved this story, I have seen the Disney version a thousand times, read stories with the same concept, but never have I seen it like this. I knew immediately that I had to have the DVDs and the soundtrack.

I love the packaging of the box set, when you open it each season is separated into a little ""book"" and each ""page"" holds a disc. I thought it matched the story perfectly. The bonus footage is not as in-depth as I would like. I'm one of those people who when they love something (book, movie, series, ect) I become a little obsessed for a while and I want to see interviews, behind the scene footage, ANYTHING and EVERYTHING I can get my hands on. This had a few neat extras but it isn't anything that I hadn't already discovered on youtube, or a fanblog. However it is very convenient to have all three season in one box rather than 3 boxes that the seasons are separately.

I would definitely say shop around for pricing, Barnes and Noble had this for $55 and I bought it elsewhere online for $30 (including shipping).",1330387200,,1220,4.370044052863436

3477224,5,B001AZIRZO,"My review is regarding the ""letters to Catherine"" in this review.

I just recently received all 3 season and wanted to check out the bonus disc where the letters to Catherine are.  Many fans do not realize there were letters from the tv show.

On the bonus disc, there are 4 items you can click on in the Main menu.
The 2nd one is ""Original Love Letters"" and the 3rd are the ""Newly Reconstructed Love letters""

The original love letters are ""READ"" by Vincent; make no mistake about it.  Though they could have done a better job of re-mastering them. At times, they sound almost pieced together...perhaps the originals were damaged and they did their best to re-assemble them - but it is Vincent's voice. You will see Vincent writing the letters and the words scroll across the screen as Vincent reads them.  They are some of the best love letters you will ever read or listen to.  There are only 4 original love letters.

The ""Newly Reconstructed love letters"" is some actor reading them (not Vincent) and there is no scrolling of the letters like there is in the original love letters. Why the powers that be used an actor to read Vincent's love letters is stupid and unforgivable, but don't let it detour from buying the dvds. There are 7 love letters here. I personally won't bother listening to the ""Newly Reconstructed love letters"".  If they had scrolled the words, it would've been worth listening to.

My point on this review is there are letters that Vincent reads.  A lot of reviewers are upset that there is not. Its simply not true. Four is better than none.",1325030400,,1570,4.591397849462366
3477225,5,B001AZIRZO,"I want to start by saying what a HUGE fan I am of this show. I used to watch this show religiously every week when I was in elementary school.  Looking back, I am surprised it did not frighten me.  Seeing Vincent angry could send chills down a person's spine pretty easily.  I fell in love with this show when I was little. The beautiful love between Vincent and Catherine.

I never got to buy individual seasons of this show because the retailers where I live couldn't keep them in stock long enough.  When I found the complete series set, I was elated, to say the very least.  The price is fantastic.

I personally love the look of the packaging.  I was suprised to see how the individual seasons are presented in the box.  I assumed they would appear in the same manner in which they were sold originally.  They are not.

The only major complaint I have is that Season One is the only season with a play all feature.  I prefer having the play all feature on a dvd box set for a television series.  It saves me from having to fiddle with my remote.

At any rate, this won't stop you from enjoying this show, if you were a fan in the 80's, and falling in love with it all over again.  If you are a newcomer to the show, you will find something for everyone in this fantastic series.  Lovers of romance will find storylines to accomodate them.  People who love mystery and intrigue will find something to accomodate them as well.  Action seekers will also be accomodated by this show.

I give this series 5 stars not just for the memories it gave me, or the lessons it taught me about love, but also for what it represents which is finding beauty in a world where it seems impossible to find.

I also have to mention my favorite quote from the show.  Once you read it, you will know why this show endures so much with fans.  ""Though lovers be lost, love shall not, and death shall have no dominion.""  In season three, they put lyrics to the theme song during a montage.  It said ""The first time I loved forever was when you whispered my name and I knew at once you loved me.""  I don't remember the rest.

For anyone who hasn't seen the show, I do not wish to spoil it. So I will say that as a child I was not real keen on Season 3 because of a tragic event that takes place.  It ripped my heart right out.  The show is still a brilliant, well written, well produced, well acted series.

If you want to watch a series that will give you a piece of ""once upon a time"" in your modern life, you should definitely buy ""Beauty and the Beast"" - The Complete Series.  This show endures with the same beauty and heart that it had when it premiered 24 years ago.

I decided to purchase the box set so that I could relive the experience.  Amazingly, it was better the second time around.  Nothing like this has ever been on network television since.  I thought TV took a big step with this series and even more so after watching it a second time.  You don't see ""Catherine"" much anymore, but ""Vincent"" is all over the place.  I'm glad to see him doing more because he has such an on-screen presence.  If you're on the fence about this one like I was, don't be.  It's every bit as enjoyable as it was the first time.

It taught valuable lessons; like having unconditional love, and that we should always choose what is best, not just for us, but for those our decisions may affect.  In each segment there is a message, or moral. It's good, clean entertainment for the whole family.  There is a point to be made in each show, and gives parents an open window to discuss important topics with family members.  I am so glad I got the complete set.

Ron Perlman made a fantastic representation of Vincent (man-beast) that would risk everything to protect his beloved Catherine. Even at the end of the serie that Catherine (Linda Hamilton) died; the strength of the sorrow and grief that the beast character projects turns the most cynical person into a watery pot. Thanks to CBS and these wonderful actors to create such a beautiful characters.,1279411200,36,560,4.84375

It is a romantic fairy tale brought to life in New York between Catherine, a wealthy lawyer and the man (Vincent - the beast) who saves her life.  Vincent and Catherine are connected on a very deep level and he senses when she is in danger and comes to her rescue.  Knight in shining armour.  I think Vincent embodies what women look for in men (though they might not admit it).  He's strong, compasionate, gentle, reads poetry and has a wonderful voice that will melt your heart.  It also shows that true beauty is more than skin deep.  It's what's inside that counts.  To this day I am a huge fan of Ron Perlman who brought Vincent to life.",1273449600,24,727,4.255474452554744

I remember asking my Grandmother  ""does that place really exist under the ground?""  It was all so whimsical, yet strangely believable.  Even more so to a child.
As an adult, I was reminded about my beloved childhood show and  really excited when I ordered the box set.  With the first episode, the same feelings of awe and mystery instantly came back to me.  The love story between the characters is so poetic and beautiful.  I also love the ""do good, belief in humanity"" morality of the show.  I  thoroughly enjoyed  all the episodes, the characters, the music, the poetry (the latter two convinced me into buying the soundtrack which I also LOVE).  I definitely recommend this show that has captured me from the age of five to twenty-seven.

Ps- The love letters are a nice edition, although I hear this isn't a new concept to this version of the box set.  The re-constructed love letters are lessened by their non-Vincent narrator.",1254700800,23,1069,4.697297297297298

Some of my favorite episodes are unwatchable because of this problem. ""A children's Story"", ""Dead of Winter"" and many others have this problem. One of my favorites ""When the Bluebird Sings"" also is bad. Has this happened to anyone else who bought this set or is it just mine?

3477272,5,B001AZIRZO,"I was so pleased to recieve the Beauty and the Beast Complete Series. I set down fer the entire weekend, and enjoyed a Beauty and the Beast marathon. Fer those of you who may not know the world of Vincent and Catherine. The shadows of the night belong to Vincent, and it was in those shadows that he found his Catherine. Her protector and confidant, she his eyes to the world above, with many side stories and ""helpers"" to keep the story moving along. Within four days I had watched three seasons of Beauty and the Beast. Time had passed since the series has been on, it was like watchin a new series.  I was amazed how much of it I had forgotten. Surprisingly, seeing Vincent and Catherine and folks from the world below, was like watching a new series all in one weekend.  And now I get to go back and revisit them whenever I wish. Tell me what could be greater, like revisiting an old friend. In my opinion, Vincent is to date the best role Ron Perlman has performed. You could really get into how Vincent felt having to live in the tunnels. And then his and Catherine connection. Don't want to give it all away, IF there is anyone out there who may not have not seen this program. Watch it, there is something fer the the guys and gals alike. I am so glad to now have my own copy, moreover, I watch a program taken from us way to soon, whenever I desire.  Not at the programing notion of a TV station, although thanks to said TV station I became a follower of Vincent and Catherine. Until I found the entire seasons collection, I could only watch a few episodes of it on the puter, but they do not have them all. I have alot of episodes on VHS, but have long since lost the VHS player. The DVD  series is a great way to reveiw a favorite program, visit some old friendif you will.

3477278,5,B001AZIRZO,"I thought this was a good disk set. It didn't matter to me if the art work on the box was a bit different than the real ""Vincent"". It was still a good look for a ""beast"". All that mattered to me was that the real Vincent was on the disks, the disks were decent quality and all the seasons were there. I especially liked the short introductions by Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton prior to some of the episodes. I didn't really care about the other guy who read the poems on the bonus disk. The first few poems seemed to be Ron Perlman's voice. I recommend it. I was happy with it and the price was right.

I'm really glad this disk set was created because believe it or not I never saw this series when it was originally running and would not have been aware of it had I not seen it over Valentines Day on Chiller TV. I really loved this series!!!! I think Ron Perlman played this character fabulously. His strapping size and persona was so well played for a ""Beast"". Of course Linda Hamilton was so beautiful and also played her character so well.  (She's still beautiful). Wish it had a better ending though. Romance and life should try to be more about happy endings.

I will definately get Karen Haws's book. I really admire her effort to create a happy ending to this series after her own sad trajedy. What a strong and talented lady she must be.",1238284800,4,1349,4.2823529411764705

Bring Diana Bennett in as a detective profiling Cathrine's death allowed her to become a special friend of Vincent.

3477291,1,B001AZIRZO,"CBS/Paramount along with MGM lead the pack when it comes to bad packaging. MGM took the lead with the new Alfred Hitchcock Premiere Collection packaging where all the discs were stuck unprotected into cardboard slats but CBS/Paramount has caught up and perhaps surpassed MGM with its new Beauty and the Beast Complete Series packaging. Props CBS.

Like the MGM Hitchcock set, the Beauty and the Beast set comes poorly packed. In this case the discs are housed in accordion like cardboard and are simply stuck unprotected into cardboard slats (MGM and CBS have apparently never heard of archival quality polyprop sleeves). Can you say scratched discs? Well I can and so can this package. It is a pity that CBS simply didn't package the wonderful slimline packages they put the individual seasons in together but hey this is CBS the same company that savaged ""Holocaust"" by transferring it horribly and by cutting it.

As to the show itself, it's not bad though I think it is overrated by its fans. Is it Due South? No. Is it Buffy? No. Is it Firefly? No. Is it Lost? No. What it is is a good series with intelligence, imagination, and heart. Personally I prefer those episodes that flesh out the underground world. One word suffices for the transfer: mediocre. But again this is CBS.

Some final words: Why do I even bother to buy anything from this we don't put much effort into our DVDs because gullible consumers will buy them anyway company? I hope I have learned my lesson. Why do some of us bother writing reviews of transfer quality and packaging when the Amazonian masses appear not to care? Because it matters.",1230076800,23,1618,4.7304964539007095
3477292,5,B001AZIRZO,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday. we used to watch it when it was on tv, and she had told me she was just wondering if her old recorded vhs tapes of the show would work since dvd's weren't available back then. She LOVED it she said the quality and feel was just like being back in the 80's again. i recommend this series if your a fan of either Ron Perlman or Linda Hamilton (BEFORE she was in terminator). excellent buy.",1229385600,8,433,4.105882352941176

3477294,5,B001AZIRZO,I just received my Beauty and the Beast Complete Collection.  I was upset at first when I realized that it was packaged very similar to the Crosby Show Complete Series with 3 interior cardboard packages.  One for each season of beauty and the beast but unlike the Cosby show set the dvds were preserved in perfect condition.  I think this is the first time cardboard packaging has worked correctly as it was supposed to.,1228435200,8,420,4.648648648648648
3477295,5,B001AZIRZO,"I was completely captivated by the 1980s television series Beauty and the Beast which is a touching love story about a man and a woman from different worlds, set in New York City.  Catherine Chandler (Beauty) is an attorney, who has grown up in privileged luxury, and Vincent (The Beast) is a man with terrifying feline facial features who lives in a forgotten world of tunnels and caves far below the city.  Together, these 2 lovers deal with ancient moral issues which are still important today, handle personal crises in their relationship arising from the differences between their worlds, and fight crime and face dangerous perils in both worlds.

This boxed set of 16 DVDs, containing all 3 seasons--a total of 55 episodes, are digitally remastered, and have restored this fabulous story to modern crystal clarity.  The series is a wonderful study in how to develop a lasting relationship.  The theme is, ""Don't be selfish!""  Don't demand that your partner be responsible for your happiness.  Do make every effort to make him or her happy, even if you need to make sacrifices to do so.  Don't think of your partner as a project which needs constant improvement.  I know I am not the only person out there who is sick to death of ""one night stands"" and ""casual sex"" being passed off as genuine love and satisfying passion.  Those are very poor counterfeits for the real thing, and this fabulous series portrays the real thing in rich romantic majesty.

In this boxed set, Seasons 1 and 2 are identical to the already released individual seasons of the series.  For those who are not familiar with them, Season 1 contains 6 disks with 22 episodes.  Season 2 contains 6 disks with 22 episodes as well, but it also has the addition of wonderful commentaries by Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton.  The difference is in the Season 3 set of disks.  The individual Season 3 has only 3 disks with 11 episodes.  In this boxed set there are 4 disks in the 3rd season set.

The 4th disk of the 3rd season contains approximately 1  hours of very nice extras for series addicts.  There is an interactive section of ""Vincent's Journey"" through the tunnels to rescue Catherine requiring answers to questions from the series episodes to continue the journey.  I have a very simple DVD player and was able to easily participate in that fun memory exercise.  There is also a section containing 4 of Vincent's original love letters to Catherine in Vincent's voice and then 8 ""Newly Reconstructed"" letters from the series episodes.  Finally, there are original promotional previews shown on network television in the late 1980s before the 1st airing of 13 episodes.

My complaints with this set are few.  I and many other fans HATE the Vincent artwork on the outer box!  If you have never viewed the series before, please be assured, that is NOT VINCENT!  Vincent's majestic feline features are completely lost in that poorly rendered profile image.  I was happy to see that on the packaging inside, the original artwork from the 3 individual seasons was used on each cover.  I was also disappointed that it was neither Ron Perlman's nor his ""Vincent"" voice that was used to record the newly reconstructed love letters.  The only way they are better is due to the deletion of the script running across the same reused scenes from the series.  Instead, the appropriate episode scenes are used for each letter without the distraction of the written script.  The man who did the reading does have a sexy bass voice, but it isn't Vincent's voice.  Still, this entire series always feeds my soul, so this boxed set is still a bargain and a great gift for those who ache for true romance.

Because of my love of Beauty and the Beast, I wrote a 500 plus page sequel novel which was completed and published in May of 2008  entitled Love's Journey to Awakening--Beauty and the Beast--Happily Ever After.  It was edited by Dr. Thayle K. Anderson, an English professor emeritus, from Murray State University.  He is a trusted friend, and a colleague of my beloved late husband, Dr. Gary L. Haws, who was my ""Vincent.""

My book has a very specific target audience, those who love this series starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton, and hate its premature demise with its tragic ending.  My book fixes that.  It doesn't change the ending.  It begins where the series ends and changes the outcome, so it has an happy ending and perhaps a new beginning for more stories about these beloved characters.

If that idea appeals to you, it is essential that you watch all 3 seasons before reading my book.  Even if you saw them when they first aired 20-plus years ago, you really need to review and watch them again in order to fully understand and appreciate my book.  I never get tired of watching them, and I hope that you will enjoy seeing these characters come back to life with a new story line.

The questions from the series that my novel answers are:
1. Is Catherine Chandler (Beauty) really dead?
2. Where did Vincent (the Beast) really come from?
3. Can there be an happy ending to a modern day fairytale that starts out, ""Once Upon a Time in the City of New York?""

Buy this boxed set containing all three seasons of the series.  Then visit my website, where you can download a free copy of my entire novel.  My website link can be accessed at kandycain1587 ""My World"" on eBay, on my profile page here on Amazon under Karen L. Haws, or by using any Internet search engine under title or author.  The time-line and characters are very precious to me, and I was very careful with them.  I hope that you will enjoy reading my book as much as I enjoyed writing it.
