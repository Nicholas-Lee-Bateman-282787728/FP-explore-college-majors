8088112,5,B000BKVL6G,"Born into a family of nine, he was the seventh, and so, did not receive much attention, but still wanted to be a part of the family.

As a child, he rubbed noses with the elite in England, but never forgot about the plite of the less fortunate.

When his father returned to America Robert went to Harvard University, and met his future wife when he decided to move to New York at the age of 24.

Becoming an attorney he worked with McCarthy for a while, was the driving force behind his brother's primary and presidence, took on organised crime and made very powerful enemies.

Then came the Cuban crisis, in which he saved the lives of millions of Americans.

With the assassination of his brother Robert was working with Johnson, but this made Robert despise the man. Being invited to speek at the Demonatic National Convention in Atlantic City, he received a 22 minute ovation which made Johnson hate Robert.

Travelling to poverty stricken areas of Mississippi he learnt the true meaning of poverty in America. Where ever he went people wanted to know when he was planing to run for the White House.

Segregation was at the center of his political life, but the war in Veitnam would overshadow it.

At Robert's funeral, his only remaining brother, Ted, said, ""Be remembered simply as a good and decent man who saw wrong and tried to right it. Saw suffering and tried to heal it. Saw war and tried to stop it."" This was the ecidence of Robert's life.

At 42 he was laid to rest thirty yards from his slain brother at the Arlington Cemetery on the evening of June 8, 1968.

My personal opinion of Robert F. Kennedy is, that he was a decent, good and honest man who tried most of his short life to fix, what he saw, was corrupt in America, and wanted the people of America to live without fear, without poverty and without the festering rot that comes with society when there is fear, hatred, corruption and selfishness.

I give this documentary five stars, and recommend it also as it shows the many sides of a man destined to give so many people hope for a new life.",1373328000,,2069,4.476063829787234
8088113,4,B000BKVL6G,"This is a good summary on the life of RFK. I would have preferred something longer and more in depth, but this isn't a bad start for those who are just starting to learn about the Kennedy's.
Please note that this episode is also contained in the DVD, ""RFK: His Life and Legacy"". I had purchased that several months after buying this, hoping that it would be a totally different program, but it was the exact same thing.",1262563200,2,419,4.384615384615385
8088114,5,B000BKVL6G,Very informative on the life of RFK and would recommend this to any one that enjoys this type of bio. The DVD came in very good condition and in a resonable amount of time.,1258243200,,172,4.088235294117647
