3475985,5,B001AZI236,"One night I sat up off the couch and felt something shift in my back. The next day I could not move. I heard CF is great for people with back injuries, so once I got the ok from my doctor to start moving, I did so via the CF Body Sculpt and Pilates Plus DVD's!! MAN, let me tell you- to be able to go at my own pace, engage in movement that worked both the intensity of MY level of fitness and challenged BEYOND it, without feeling my back was amazing! Plus, I was able to build my strength, shape my body like never before, and shave inches off my thighs and waist,  all while healing my injury! I felt empowered in a very defeating situation. it was so good for me mentally and emotionally to know I could still EXERCISE while doing something safe and effective for my body! I have never FELT STRONGER!!!",1228953600,85,806,4.13375796178344

3475996,5,B001AZI236,"I am using Body Sculpt as well as some other Core Fusion DVDs. I had back surgery in December, a lumbar fusion.  After the surgery I continued with right low back pain and sciatica. I was really disappointed thinking the surgery wasn't successful.  I continued with physical therapy where I was informed that due to my original injury, it seemed I was overcompensating from a muscular perspective and created a muscle imbalance in my hips and hamstrings.  They gave me exercises to do that really didn't help much.  The only thing that gave me relief was doing yoga which I have done for years.  I decided I needed find a workout that would stretch and strengthen while giving me the overall benefits of yoga.  After a lot of research, I purchased CF Body Sculpt and Pilates and slowly began to do a few sections. After about 3 weeks, I noticed I was sleeping better and my pain was less intense.  Until I started these DVDS, my pain was intense and constant..my pain had started to be intermittent after a few weeks of use. I went on to purchase Power Sculpt, Legs and Glutes, Cardio Intensity, and Energy Flow.  I interchange the sections based on what I feel I need to work the most.  After a few months, I would say my pain has diminished by 75%, I am more toned, feel better, and lost a few pounds.  While there isn't a magic cure for pain relief or weight loss, consistent use of these DVDS and a healthy diet really give results.  I am beyond excited and want to thank Fred and Elisabeth for creating these great workouts.  I really believe in Core Fusion. I find these workouts smart and effective and produce amazing results...I hope to attend a live class at some point and go to their spa which I hear is amazing. Elisabeth is a true inspiration to women who want to be strong and fit..she is a great instructor who is genuine and very warm.",1469059200,,1852,4.462908011869437
3475997,5,B001AZI236,"I typically do not like workout videos, but this one is one that I really actually like. Its easy to do at home, it's broken into sections so you can do what you have time to do, whether 10 minutes or an hour, it's not obnoxious like many other videos, and lastly, my muscles feel it so I know it's working!",1468800000,,307,4.049180327868853

3476000,5,B001AZI236,One of the best workouts on video I've ever done.  The video is divided into segments with a stretching portion in each 10 min segment so if you can't get the whole workout in you'll still have a good balanced workout.  They explain each exercise well and focus on form and the exercises really work your muscles but in a way that will sculpt them long and lean - I can feel the difference in my body only after doing this workout a few times.  Awesome!,1466640000,,453,4.244186046511628
3476001,5,B001AZI236,"Love CoreFusion.  It's a really intense muscle workout that you'll absolutely see results with.  I particularly like this one - I have the others, arms, legs, etc...and I keep going back to this one.  It's been particularly useful when I've been really busy - you can do quick 10 minute workouts when you can squeeze them in (i.e. when a fussy baby takes a short nap, when you meant to wake up an hour earlier and squeeze in a full workout but only have 20 minutes, etc.).  I've taken a class at Exhale in Boston, and that was crazy hard too, but they're super expensive, and obviously not in every city...this is a great substitute.",1465862400,3,633,4.478260869565218
3476002,5,B001AZI236,I love this workout. It's still hard and I've been using it on and off for about a year. I love that it's broken up into 4 different mini workouts so you can just fit in a quick workout when you don't have time.,1464566400,,211,3.8181818181818183

Nothing worse for me than listening over and over to cheesy ""you can do it"" fake smiles and so forth. I used to do Denis's workouts on mute for this reason)

 I've only done the stretch and upper body workout however I can see how well this will work for me and how I can add more weight to make the workout harder as time goes on.

I borrowed this originally from the library which is a great way to make sure you will or won't like the dvd's and just bought it.",1453766400,2,686,4.2615384615384615

3476039,4,B001AZI236,"This can be an intense video if you do the entire video at once.  It is broken up into 10 minute sections base on the part of the body it focuses on such as adomen, legs, etc.  The couple doing the videos are in fantastic shape that I would suspect even those who are in good shape would find it a challenge.  The interactions between the couple is odd or rehearsed (and likely so), but that doesn't distract from the content. I would be nice if they video stated how many minutes left in the section to really let you know how far you are in that 10 mins.",1445040000,,556,4.08256880733945

3476061,5,B001AZI236,"These is a well-designed, fun and incredibly effective workout that I never get tired of.  It remains challenging even as you are rewarded with the results of subtle transformation which accumulates with every single session. Awesome balance of strengthening and lengthening - there are targeted stretching exercises to compliment each section. I like the versatility - you can do the whole workout dvd, or divide the workouts into different days.  For example, I like to do arms, thighs, and abs on one day, then glutes and abs another day (while my burning thighs recover haha). The final section, which is stretching and cool-down, is very relaxing and a nice way to soak up the endorphins of the sweat you just worked up.",1429660800,3,725,4.934426229508197

I appreciate that many exhale videos like this one are broken into 10 minute segments. I can do the entire 50 minute workout or break it into parts each day.

So arms, abs, legs, etc. are all done in a 5 min. session and the trainers do the exercises while someone narrates it. I actually like this. I feel the exercises move alone faster, hence the 5 min. sessions. I was sore as heck the next day. The leg session is intense lol. I was shaking for sure. I loved the ab session. One of my favorite ways I've ever done, or ever seen done. The way they did it is great. You hold your legs up against a wall and I find this excellent in order for you to keep your form.

I didn't want to go find a ""Pure Barre"" class, as I heard it was very costly so, this looked very similiar and the price was right. I can truly say that after 1 week of doing this about 5 times, I really saw a change in my body tone. I needed something that wasn't so strenuous on my joints (I'm in great shape for 49) however, my lower back and knees couldn't take the pounding I was doing to it with the harder cardio workouts. Right away my arms became more toned and my thighs are REALLY changing. I LOVE that I'm lengthening my muscles and not bulking up as some ""toning"" videos cause you to do. The other thing that really surprised me was how I couldn't do each routine all the way through, initially. That in itself was a shock to me, as I thought I was in really good shape for this! Now I can do the whole routine and while it can burn while you are doing it, it's not painful at all. The last information I will give is how much you will SWEAT when you complete this video.

Then I moved on to the Jillian Michaels DVDs, and while they were great (and I did lose the majority of the weight I wanted to) something was missing. Not only did I dread working out each day but I didn't find myself gaining any real strength or definition.

That's when I stumbled upon this DVD. I knew nothing about the Core Fusion program and hadn't heard of EXHALE Spa. The first time I did this DVD, my muscles were shaking and I felt like every piece of my body was exhausted. But the next day, I found myself excited to do it again! After just 3 workouts, I started to notice my body changing! I was already beginning to tone up and was no longer feeling completely limp by the end of the workout. I started alternating this workout with the other Core Fusion DVDs like Arms and Abs, Thighs and Glutes, and Lean and Toned. Now I do one of the DVDs 4 days a week and cardio 1 day a week. I have never felt or looked so good!

There are some complaints from others that there is wasted time on the DVD and lots of stretching.

Everything seems very simple (and it is) but like every other pilates class, It is really important to have a have the correct alignment while doing the exercises. I found that in this DVD, everything is really well explained to accomplish the correct posture, and finally the correct workout.

The first time I did this workout session, I had to take a little more breaks than the ones they say to (but that is fine). The next day It was hard to move, my whole body hurt. But after repeating this workout for several (maybe a lot of) of times, I could feel how I was getting better at it. BE PATIENT!!!

This DVD divides the workout in 5 areas (arms, butt, thighs, abs, stretching) each one last 10 minutes. So, sometimes if I didn't had a lot of time to workout, I would only work 2 areas (arms & abs or butt & thighs or abs & butt, etc etc), plus the stretching part (you should never miss that).

This Core Fusion work out was just what I needed!  It's challenging, and my heart is still thumping, but I didn't have to jump around or do hard to follow cardio-dance moves to get it.
The instructors are pleasant with out being fake, and the music is unobtrusive, you barely notice it's there.
I was sitting on the couch, decided to buy a video on Amazon Instant and just do it. ""I'll do one 10 min segment"" I said to myself.... I didn't want to stop! I did the whole thing all the way through, and although I fully expect not to be able to move very well tomorrow, I will at least do the stretching portion and then start up with the full video again on Monday.
The segments are about 10 min long and the instruction is very easy to follow. You aren't pushed to work through anything your body can't handle, and the instructor even takes breaks along with you through some of the more difficult stuff.
This isn't for the mega athlete who's looking for something to kick their tail into submission, but it's definitely a challenge! I just highly recommend this, I doubt you'll be disappointed! :) The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's my first go round with it. I'm sure I'll get amazing results if I just stick with it, but that is yet to be determined.",1359763200,3,1639,4.3387622149837135

In this video you'll find lot of the exercises done in studio, and substitutes for exercises that simply can't be done at home without the bar.  I wish there were an easier way to navigate the five separate segments, or an option to skip the beginning intro session after the first viewing, but you can fast forward to the beginning of the warm-up if, like me, you don't want to waste the minute + of them discussing the benefits of the approach and the workout.  I find the on-screen instructors a bit irritating, but the workout is good enough to keep me coming back to it.

For those who aren't familiar with the classes, the approach is a mix or ""fusion"" of several different styles, notably Lotte Berk method (like Bar Method), and Pilates.  The movements seem small, and they are, but they are targeted and they pack a punch.  My husband initially poked a bit of fun when he saw me doing the exercises, until he began to try it and found himself shocked by how much of a punch they pack.

I have had this DVD since the beginning of the year, and I did use it plenty of times -- once or twice a week.  It consists of 10-ish minute portions to work upper body, thighs, glutes, abs, and stretching.  I usually didn't do the stretch ones due to time constraints, but I know it's better to do them.

The upper body one really makes my arms burn with 3lb weights.  Maybe I'm just weak or something, but I used to not be able to get through without stopping, and I consider myself decently fit (11-time marathoner, 26 half-marathons and very regular exerciser).  The thigh segment isn't that hard for me because I've done Bar Method and similar workouts, but some of the exercises still make my legs shake.  The butt section is hard only because I can't stay bent over for that long without my calves getting angry.  The ab section was the hardest for me in the beginning, but I think it's by far the most effective portion of the disc.

I am not the biggest fan of the lady on this DVD... she looks smug, and the voice-over isn't all that great.  I also think the pace could definitely be faster -- you will not get much caloric burn from this workout, no matter what the voice-over says.  This is just a good supplement to other cardio you do during the week -- in fact, I would often run later in the day after this.",1338249600,,1545,4.235494880546075

I don't mean to sound insulting, but I found this DVD laughable...pretty hokey... and for my taste- too many props. Sorry to everyone who likes this workout...it did burn but I could not get into the zone and I didn't feel like it was a holistic approach....more focused on specific parts of the body at a time- so yes, it was working certain muscles but I never felt that ""oh good...i'm getting a great workout"" feeling. Instead I was thinking, ""Ok now i'm gonna have to do another workout.""  As for my props comment, I guess I'm a believer in a yoga mat and that's about it. This video requires a chair, weights, strap and mat. I feel you can get a lot more done with poses and exercises that include more of the body and using your own body weight (vs weights).

3476280,5,B001AZI236,"I bought this DVD in early December 2011 -- so just about three months ago. I am 62, and while not totally out of shape, I was worried about losing muscle tone and turning flabby -- I had a bit of a spare tire around my mid-sction. It took me about two weeks before I could finish the gluteal lifts without lowering my leg -- and man was I sore. It took another week before I could finish the thigh section -- oh the burn! The arms section has always been just moderate for me -- needed to increase the weights right away. And the abs.... am starting just now to follow Fred more than Liz.

So the bottom line? My body shape has completely transformed. My butt is lifted like a 30-something. I have NEVER had a flat stomach -- now guess what. Flat! When I used to sit in an easy chair, my spare tire would be out as far as my boobs -- and it was useless to wear a belt as it would completely disappear! NO MORE!! Now when I sit in an easy chair, I can still see my belt! It is amazing. The back of my arms are still a bit flabby, so I'm amping up with a kettlebell DVD (I'll review it in a couple of months). I live in the mountains of Colorado and can now keep up with my husband skiing because my thighs NEVER get tired. I can hardly wait for summer to get here as there are a few 14'ers that will get hiked with my new strong legs.(That's short for 14,000 foot peaks)

I've gone down one size in my pants and my waistband is actually loose -- a first for me as I used to carry a lot of weight in my belly. I'm  not buying any new clothes yet, as I'm sure I'm not done losing inches! And did I mention cellulite? Hardly noticeable -- and less each month!

Ok -- yes. I should say, I also changed my diet a bit -- am eating protein with every meal, and have five small meals instead of three medium size and I'm losing about one pound per week.

I have a couple of other Core Fusion CD's but this one is my fav. My husband loves this younger looking, younger feeling body! Love this program.",1331164800,22,1992,3.9949748743718594
3476281,2,B001AZI236,"I bought this DVD based on the strength of the good reviews here on Amazon...wow was I led astray by the Amazon community!

I recently got into the Bar Method and bought one of their DVDs. I wanted to mix it up so I looked on Amazon for some other barre/isometric/Lotte Berk inspired workouts.

Firstly, I hate that the DVD is voiced over instead of the instructors speaking as they work. This perhaps explains why the DVD is SO POORLY CUED. Without counts (i.e., let's do 2 sets of 10, 3 more to go, etc.) it's so hard to tell when an exercise starts and stops. Also, you'll often see an instructor stop the exercise, and then you hear the cue to end. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's also extremely repetitive (""ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips"")--I get that posture is an important part of an effective workout, but I don't need to hear it fifty times. There's also other time-wasting instruction (""breathe, enjoy the stillness, etc."") I'm just trying to get a good workout, not go to therapy!

To me, one test of a great workout DVD is whether I can follow along without having to stare at the TV the whole time--the cueing should be descriptive enough that you can turn away from the TV (i.e., to check your form in the mirror, which is really key in a workout like this.) I couldn't do that with this DVD. Again, this is just due to terrible voiceover and cueing. More actual instruction would be helpful--less focus on ""enjoying the stillness."" And during the ab segment, how are you supposed to put your feet on the wall and watch the TV at the same time? I kept having to twist my neck around to see the TV, and thus didn't feel like I was able to do the exercises correctly. I basically just ended up doing my own ab workout, because it was impossible to watch and perform the exercises at the same time.

The DVD is also listed as 5 10-minute workouts. Well, for the first four, 2 minutes of each segment is eaten up by stretches, and the final segment is only stretching. This means there is only about 32 minutes of work on the DVD. That's not enough for me to feel like I got a real workout in.

The one redeeming factor of this DVD was the glute segment. I really felt the burn there. However, even for the 10 minutes of the thigh work, I barely felt the burn...and I feel like the burn within 2 minutes of thigh work using Bar Method's DVDs.

Second, I love the way the workouts are broken up into manageable ten-minute workouts targeting each area of the body.  Finally, and most importantly, I started to notice dramatic results in strength and toning after the first workout.  Wow.  I was impressed.

It involves a lot of challenging sustained postures, so is not heavy on cardio but is tremendous when it comes to flexibility & muscular endurance. The instructors give wonderful information about form and modifications. After doing the entire routine I feel centered and balanced (though sore). Those kinds of differences make it a great alternative to more bouncy workout routines (which I also enjoy). While I highly recommend it for those with vulnerable joints, know that this does push you to your own personal limits.

I think the title is misleading as it's not a body sculpting DVD, it's more of a stretching DVD with very few toning exercises. The pace was really slow and boring.

I bought this video as a way to mix up my workouts on days that I don't run. This video does not make me sweat and really doesn't increase my heart rate. I'd say there is probably an equal amount of isometrics to stretching. I do start to feel a burn during the isometrics which is great. They do stretching after working each part of the body which keeps things moving at a slow pace.

When I reviewed a short section on Youtube I was pretty sure it would be super simple and wondered whether it would be particularly effective. It LOOKs so easy. But since I started this particular dvd just a few months ago, everybody I know has asked what I've been doing to get into such fantastic shape. I'm smallish (5'4"" and 125 pounds) and in my late 50s. I'm in far better shape than I've been and better than nearly anybody I know and have had more success with this form of exercise than any other. At the same time, I continue to do pilates and yoga and also to use my treadmill, although I now rely more on the Core Fusion method than any other. Is Core Fusion boring and repetitive as others have suggested? Well yes and no. The saving grace to this method is that it breaks the sections down into small sections which keeps it from getting too dull. But truly, is any form of exercise in itself exciting? Probably not. But the Core Fusion method has gotten my body into shape better and more quickly than anything ever has, and I'm continually amazed by the results. Love this.",1320364800,11,1297,4.453781512605042
3476316,5,B001AZI236,"I really can't recommend this Core Fusion Body Sculpt DVD enough. It's a tough workout, but the 50 minutes seem to go by very quickly. It's because there are 5 different 10 minute segments and each segment seems to go very fast. At the end of each segment there is some great stretching and the final segment is all stretching. Even though I work really hard and sweat like crazy, I feel relaxed and refreshed when I finish.

I would also like to point out that this isn't just for the young. I am an active 61 year old, going to the gym almost every day, working out with weights and doing my cardio. When you start the workout, you simply do what you can and increase your stamina. Anyone can do this. In spite of the fact that I've been working out regularly for quite a long time, I still have seen surprising changes take place in the 2 weeks that I have been doing this workout, particularly in my abs. Pretty exciting for an old girl like me.

I've never been one to enjoy an exercise video, but there's just something different here. I loved it right away. I actually find myself looking forward to it and want to do it.

If you're looking for something that will make you work, yet let you easily go at your own pace, and keep you stretched out and relaxed at the same time, I think you'll love this one. I'll be trying more of the Core Fusion workouts in the future...soon.",1316736000,4,1383,4.291187739463601

The exercises are very easy to follow but are so focused that you feel the results *immediately*. They are also easily modifiable for beginners or individuals just getting started and you will still get tremendous benefit as you build up your strength.

The Core Fusion exercises involve precise and subtle, but very effective, movements that produce quick and amazing results that you can see and feel.  After having done the workouts for just about three times, my waistline shrank two inches, and my triceps and quad muscles started to show definition.  And, when I sent an e-mail to Elisabeth Halfpapp and Fred Devito, the creators of Core Fusion, with questions about one of the exercises, Ms Halfpapp sent me a reply to my questions less than 24 hours later, which is great customer service.

What I don't like:
1.) Starting the upper body section with a triceps exercise.  The standard is to start with larger muscle groups like chest or back, and move to smaller muscle groups like biceps and triceps.
I find it difficult to do the triceps exercises when my upper body is not warmed up, so I have to do pushups first when I use this DVD.
2.)  The abdominal section.  I'm not a fan of staying in this scooped out position for an entire segment.  I usually modify to include some crunches.

On the positive side - The DVD covers most of the muscles in upper and lower body, giving a fairly good workout in a short amount of time.",1309910400,3,808,4.241830065359477

Body Sculpt and Long and Lean are both full body workouts, the latter a little more challenging than the former.  Both Arms and Abs and Thighs and Glutes are self-explanatory.  Pilates Plus focuses on abs/core work.  And the yoga Energy Flow and the Bootcamp DVDs are cardio workouts, the latter more challenging than the former, although both are quite rigorous and will make you sweat buckets.  I have taken both Pilates Mat and Pilates Fusion classes for a few years, and these DVDs are a wonderful complement when I am not in class, and in my opinion, are sometimes even more challenging than what I get in my exercise classes.  I have tried a number of different exercise DVDs over the years, and these are the only ones I have ever stuck with.  They are very enjoyable, challenging (but not so challenging that you give up), invigorating, interesting (they do not get boring because there is so much variety built in), and I have noticed some subtle differences in my body from my work with both the DVDs and my classes.  To really burn fat, though, you have to alter your diet. These DVDs will help with sculpting muscle (like a ballet dancer's body), but not so much with fat loss (at least I have always found that my weight loss occurs with diet and not with exercise, but that's just me.)

All of their exercises involve small, subtle movements that are surprisingly challenging and really test your strength and endurance. This dvd features 5 10 minute segments that can be done alone or combined as you desire into longer workouts. Each section (except the final) has a strengthening portion which makes up the majority of the 10 minutes, followed immediately by a stretch of the muscles just worked. This is a great technique to get the best benefit from your workout. And it feels great to immediately stretch worked muscles after intense strengthening work. The five segments include:

1) Upper body strength: Use of light hand weights to work out all of the muscles in your arms, shoulders, upper back and chest. Really pretty comprehensive for just 10 minutes. I find this section fairly challenging because it involves a lot of holding positions with minor pulses so you continuously feel the weight. I used 3 lb hand weights and I got fatigued. I have fairly weak arms though so it may not be as challenging for others.

2) Legs: This section is almost entirely made up of variations of plies (bending your legs) while up on your toes. It works your quads, thighs and calves. They use chairs as a barre to balance. I found this section doable... not overly strenuous but I still felt the work.

3) Glutes: This is the hardest section in my opinion. It involves a series of back leg lifts while standing (straight/bent leg, turned in & out). It's a test of endurance and strength. The first 5 minutes is all on one leg, then it's repeated on the other side. By the end of the 5 min. my supporting leg was shaking and burning. Really works your glutes, legs and hips.

4) Abs: While I think the ab section in the Pilates Plus dvd is the hardest you will find anywhere, I do not find this to be nearly as difficult. I'm able to fully do this section even while carrying on a conversation. That's not to say it doesn't provide a workout though. Their ab work does not involve a series of crunches... rather, it's essentially one crunch held the entire time with variations on arms and twisting the torso. Again, this makes it more of an endurance challenge than pure strength.

5) Flexibility: Starts off with constructive rest and then goes into spinal twists and leg stretches. Fairly standard stretches.

These were, however, toward the end in the stretching portion where they were talking about shivasna or something strange like that, so the overall exercises are, in my opinion, not yoga at all. The exercises are not difficult in their execution, but their repetitions are what really makes you feel the burn. There is a certain ab-exercise that really takes a lot of effort in order to maintain the position and then ad the movements, and they extend it for a super long period of time so that it becomes even more difficult. Overall, I got through all 5 10-minute segments even though I had to stop and catch my breath or stop the intense muscle burn numerous times (I'm an advanced beginner in exercising, if there is such a stage). I feel good, but I don't feel 'dead' as some other exercise videos leave me afterwards (here's looking at you Jillian Michaels...). I do, however, feel some discomfort on my back from a glute exercise which required a back leg lift. I don't know if it's because I did not warm up properly (their warm up consists of a 'power walk' basically for 60 seconds), or if I did not have proper form. Either way, I'm hoping it'll go away by tomorrow, and if not then I don't plan on doing that specific move again. There is no soreness as of yet, but we'll see tomorrow. I plan on doing the pilates plus tomorrow and the thighs and glutes and abs and arms later on during the week, so reviews for those will be available later on.

EDIT: Definitely felt the burn the next day on arms, butt and lower back (the lower back issue was resolved, now it just feels like a muscle that hasn't been worked in a long time that was just worked should feel). I didn't get anything from the core, but I compensated by doing Jillian Michaels' Trouble Zones dvd and picking just the ab/core segments.

Mainly, because if I take time to workout, I like to feel like I have worked out--feel the endorphins,  calm afterwards, etc.

I can have a hard time with DVD's because it seems more often than not, they can feel like a waste of time.

The style of this DVD is more like a yoga feel, though it definitely gets you burning.  I have a hard time making it through some of the lifted leg movements--I'm familiar with DVD's like Extreme Taebo, P-90x, Jillian McMichaels (sp?) and have stamina for them.  (I'm not saying this is harder than P-90x only that this DVD can work you out suprisingly well).

I suppose sometimes the voices are a little monotone when it feels like you're burning, but the bottom line for me is that I feel good afterwards.  It's great to do indoors during cold Chicago winters.  The time also seems to pass comparatively quickly to other DVD's.

Also-- this is the second review I've ever written for amazon.  I wrote it was because I was about to start the DVD, and was thinking about how good a product it was, that I almost felt unethical not writing a review.",1292457600,11,1109,4.413793103448276
3476360,5,B001AZI236,"A former cardio-only girl, I've recently seen the light of Lotte Berk/barre-style workouts and how magnificently they can compliment my usual running routine. Runner girls, if you're reading this, I STRONGLY recommend adding this kind of body-weight strength training to your rotation; a stronger core VASTLY improves your running, and it's really quite nice to get definition in your abs and arms.

This DVD has absolutely everything I want in it. The arms set is spectacular, and the gluteal and leg work is also phenomenal. My only gripe is that you need to have an immediately accessible wall for the ab work (something that's a little tricky to do when you have a very tightly-packed dorm room), but once you can get that all figured out it's quite challenging. The stretching segment at the end is the most incredible thing ever. I always hate hate HATE it when I don't feel like I've stretched sufficiently (and, from what I understand, barre-style workouts hinge on a good stretch to keep the muscles from getting to governator-y), but Core Fusion leaves me completely satisfied. I even do the stretch segment in the morning as a standalone routine when I feel like I need a pick-me-up.

Liz and Fred are great instructors. The cuing is fantastic, and both of their demeanors are very calming and go well with the new age-y set. It's also absolutely adorable that they're married!

The final awesome thing about this DVD is that it's really accessible. I'm probably the most awkward person alive and I manage to feel graceful doing it. My mom, who's just getting back into fitness, did the DVD with me a few days ago and found it challenging but doable. You're not going to feel spent after this workout, and that's the point.

3476362,5,B001AZI236,"I recently discovered this workout along with several others of this kind (Physique 57 and Grace Lazenby's All the Right Moves). I've been mixing and matching because I do enjoy a bit of variety.

I've been active for years with running and more recently extreme workouts like Crossfit, P90X and Insanity, but I was ready for a change. I've done yoga and a bit of pilates in the past but never felt like I was getting much out of them. Though they were challenging, if I wasn't drenched in sweat I doubted the effectiveness of a workout.  In recent years I've discovered the benefits of simple body weight training. I'm always on the lookout for something new so I decided to give this a try.

My outlook has totally changed and so has my body in just a few short weeks. I won't waste time explaining the set up as I'm sure it has been done many times with so many reviews.

The leg and seat workouts are my favorite because these have always been my problem areas. In just a few  weeks I can see a noticeable difference in my quadriceps and a lift in my butt. Since many of the moves in the workouts that I've used are similar, I definitely attribute these changes to the ballet barre and pilates movements.

I was quite challenged by the arm section of this program. After lifting heavy weights and doing pull ups for the last few years I was surprised when I had to drop down to 3lb weights!

The ab movements in several of the exhale workouts are completely new to me. Working my abs has always been my least favorite thing to do, but it's nice to do something besides endless crunches.

The best part of this program is that it is broken down into 5 ten minute sections which you can do all at once or pick and choose from when time is limited.

I've also ordered the yoga ad pre-ordered the bootcamp and can't wait to give those a try! This is a definite thumbs up!",1290643200,7,1871,4.322857142857143

And, the instructors maintain calm, placid smiles throughout all of the exercises, which can lead you to wonder ""why the heck am I shaking and groaning while they look as if they're sitting on a beach admiring the view?"".  Their calm demeanor, however, is testament to their core strength, which is truly impressive.  Ultimately, the video manages to be almost meditative in tone, while still managing to give an intense, very-focused workout for specific muscle groups.  It's a combination that took some getting used to for me, but after completing the video a few times, I now like it a lot.  I think that this video is an excellent complement to other, more cardio-driven workouts.  It is also rare in the sense that it is appropriate for beginners through advanced athletes (a claim that I see a lot, but rarely find to be true).

I did Pure Barre live classes for a while but it's incredibly expensive so I was looking for a good alternative and this is it! It's not quite as fast paced as a PB class but it was definitely tough.

The DVD has five sections:  arms, thighs, glutes, abs, and stretch.  The bonus materials include a five-minute thigh section and the back section from Pilates Plus.

I bought this DVD since I've been doing P57 for awhile and wanted to add some variety; I've gotten great results from P57, and am sure that this workout will continue those positive changes!

Hope that this review helps for those folks who have been doing P57 for awhile and need to change things up.",1286841600,3,742,4.411764705882353

Over this is really a pretty great workout when you do it you really feel it and the instructions are clear they show you how to do all the moves and modify.  The only thing I don't like is that in the ab segment I don't feel as though they target the lower abs enough so thats why I gave it 4 insteAD of 5 stars.

3476387,5,B001AZI236,"THIS tape is what I need!! Great muscle building, very clear direction on form, I sweat a little, NO IMPACT, great core strengthening.

I have done numerous workouts over the past 2 years. I discovered weights and muscle are what works. With muscle tone I can eat pretty much what I ate when I was 25 pounds heavier! I started with The Firm, upgraded to Cathe and kept injuring myself. I moved on to Jari Love (the original 3 ripped workouts are still in my rotation--better pace and more stretching than the later ones) and Coffee-Meyer (also still in for cardio). Due to a falling arch in my foot and lower back issues I added some yoga but found it irritated my irritable back/sciatica because I could never get the form quite right.

Why this one is high on my list...
1) Five 10-minute segments that can each stand alone. Plus an additional 10 minute bonus track.
2) The exercises do not require a lot of exotic gear. They target muscles in a way no other workout I have tried
3) I do all 5 segments and they fly by
4) Each series is followed by much needed, too often overlooked, stretching. The 5th segment is just straight up stretching.
5) After one workout my physical therapist could tell a difference in my muscle tone/definition. Can't beat that.

When I previewed this I thought it might be ok on my off days when I am sore or don't really feel like working out. Once I tried it I was completely won over. It is simple and effective.",1284768000,8,1447,4.411985018726591

This dvd exercises your arms, chest, back, thighs, butt, stomach and stretches all areas.  I am an advanced exerciser, so the arms parts was a little easy for me, but the butt part was very challenging.  The stomach exercises are good, but you need a wall to rest your feet on and all my walls have furniture in front of them, so that was kind of annoying.  Overall, I feel this is a good workout and I guess you can make it as difficult as you want using heavier weights.  I like the stretches after each body part is worked.

He was unconvinced that any tv workout would be any benefit to him, as he had been a cheerleader in college (yeah the kind that throws hundred pound girls HIGH in the air) and also has been known to bench 400 pounds with his legs... that being said, once i dragged him into the workout he was actually shaking and grunting through it right along with me, and even HE could not get through the whole thing the first time!  needless to say, its NOT a beginners workout, but it feels great and it makes me excited to get to the point where i can get through the WHOLE workout!  the cueing may be a bit off at first, but its not hindering.  i like that it has a voice over, and that there isn't prolonged stops to explain everything.  i have several denise austin videos where she talks and talks and talks and makes you hold a pose the whole time and that gets me a little CRAZY after a while!(besides for the kindergarten teacher mentality, i DO like her vids) but you don't have that problem with this DVD.  all in all, its hard if you are not used to working out, but it really motivates ya to get going and try to get to the point where you CAN do it all the way through.  definitly worth a try and if not, its still worth keeping around to motivate you to aspire to greater things :)",1282262400,2,1493,4.075085324232082

3476440,5,B001AZI236,"I am very new to pilates and I searched for quite a while to find a DVD that would suit my needs properly. I wanted something to encompass all the main parts of the body, mainly for toning. I felt like this would be a good option so I purchased it, and was very pleasantly surprised. It was easy enough to get the basics of pilates in my head, although once I started practicing what they were showing me in the video, I realized it was also a challenging work-out. I love that there's none of those very active work-out movements in pilates and this video - none of the jumping or push-ups. It's all through stretching into a pose and holding it. It's amazing that you can feel the burn of the toning through just holding certain poses.

As for the details of the video, I feel like the hosts explain everything perfectly, easy to understand even if you have never ever done pilates before. Also the overall atmosphere of the video is relaxing - but not too cheesy or tacky, if you know what I mean. The background music is bearable. Since I have been doing the workouts in the video, I have felt much more relaxed, but also much more energized and healthy.

If you're a beginner to pilates and looking for a full workout, or even just spot workouts (each body section is split into ten-minute work-outs) this video would be great for you. I get the feeling it's not really for the 'advanced' pilates work-out, but I'm not entirely sure since I am a beginner as well. I love this video though, I think it's a great buy and definitely worth the money. It's also convenient that you get a downloadable/streamable version of it when you purchase it.",1279843200,2,1647,4.432343234323432

3476443,5,B001AZI236,"I do a lot of workouts and was interested in seeing what Core Fusion would bring to the table...Well, in this dvd you get 5 10 minute work-outs which gives you the freedom to do one long work-out that works several muscle groups, or just pick which body part you would like to work on.  This is nice when time is limited.  Now, 10 minutes does not sound like a lot, and according to the clock it isn't a lot of time, but when you are working on holding core poses for this long, or working your arms or glutes, 10 minutes seems like a loooooong time.  What I like about this dvd is it features very easy to follow exercises that are very concentrated and effective.  If you have done ballet or other dance you recognize the plies done in the leg toning and you will recognize some pilates moves in the ab section. You get in, you work the muscle, stretch it out and you are on to the next series.  The music in the background is not distracting and the instructors are good, showing you variations where applicable.  The set is relaxing and softly lit.

The total run time of the dvd is 50 minutes and is comprised of the following:

Arms
Legs
Glutes
Abs
Stretch

I did them all and felt like I got a nice all over toning workout.  For the arm section, you will need weights (I used 3 lb.) I would say for this section 2-5 lbs. would be fine.
You may also want a yoga mat for the floor poses if your floor is not carpeted. Other than that you will be using your own body's resistance to work the poses.

I would definitely look into more in this series. Good, effective toning/sculpting exercises in a well put together routine with two excellent instructors.",1277596800,7,1659,4.285256410256411

3476445,5,B001AZI236,"There are a number of reviews on Amazon for this DVD, so depending on how you determine what type of workout is right for you, the following factors might be taken into consideration:

1. Low impact, strength training - this video certainly delivers as a workout that doesn't involve much ""jarring"" exercise - a big reason why I personally like it.  No sneakers, you can work out in your PJs

2. Time - I prefer workouts that are under 30 minutes as I frequently find it challenging to find time to work out (effectively) for an hour.  The workouts in this DVD are broken out into (approx) 10 minutes, focusing on arms, thighs, butt, core and stretching.  I like the fact that I can devote 20 minutes and target certain areas, and you will absolutely feel ""the burn"".  You may not be sore the next day, but your muscles will definitely feel tired.  Although there is a lot of time devoted to stretching, I do feel that it is necessary to take a break to realign your posture and stretch for the purpose of ""sculpting"" lean muscles.  Although the stretching may seem unnecessary or prolonged, it appears that the time of rest helps to shape the body into more of a dancer's physique.

3. Effectiveness - I personally think this is the most important factor.  As much (or as little) as you enjoy the instructors cueing, tone, delivery, etc, it really doesn't matter if you are not getting the results from the workout (in my opinion).  Any workout depends on the individual to push themselves beyond their own physical and mental limitations to truly see change and results.  I have been using Body Sculpt 5x a week for about 3 weeks and I can honestly say that I have lost inches in my waist and thighs.  I have a very athletic build and never thought my legs could be ""slim""; I've always assumed I had ""soccer legs"" as my calves and thighs were typically quite bulky.  With Body Sculpt,  I have seriously noticed a slenderizing effect on my legs, to the point where a lot of my pants are fitting LOOSELY (for pants that I wore in COLLEGE, I am now in my 30s).  I think this is the most dramatic, and truly telling, evidence of the effectiveness of this workout.  Although the voice over and comments occasionally annoy me (ears over shoulder, shoulders over hips, blah, blah, blah) , I try to ignore the monotonous monologue to get to my end goal, which is to stay slim!!!",1274313600,75,2372,4.5046728971962615

I was going to buy it to keep it as a lite rest day workout...but it is PACED TOO SLOW.  I read that in a few other reviews and did not believe it.  They were right.

Each segment allows you to adjust to your own level, which is nice. I hardly ever do the stretch sculpt segment and that's probably the one complaint I have. Since I don't do the video in its entirety, it's kind of a waste and could be replaced with an additional exercise segment, but I suppose if I were following the video the whole way through I'd probably want that at the end.

I've been on a journey since then trying so many different ways of working out. I started with gentle yoga, then jazzercise, then a personal trainer. Along the way I tried the Bar Method, Bikram hot yoga  and some pilates. The personal training did get some results but I ran out of funds as it is so expensive. The Bar Method was also amazing along with Pilates but again these were expensive options, which led me to check out what was available for at home use. I found Core Fusion by researching any training related to the Lotte Burke method. Glad I did!  I must say after doing this workout twice that I can feel results faster than I did with my personal training sessions, which nearly left me throwing up on the gym floor they were so intense.
 I love how the DVD is laid out in sections so I can do one section and come back to another later in the day if my toddler needs me at the moment.  I also feel like I am getting some cardio and sweat out of it, though I will be doing extra cardio on the off days.

I was expecting this 10 minute workout to be a light exercise DVD, for one of my off days, but the unexpected result of feeling mostly every muscle used afterwords was what I received. These mini-workouts are challenging, but feel extremely effective. Both instructors are VERY particular in correcting the posture and form of the exercises and it truly makes a difference.

The instructors do voice-overs instead of cuing, which I can't decide if I like or if I don't. (The smiling is a bit heavy in most of the segments, making them look extremely happy.)

Upper body: One of my most neglected body parts, and it showed. Half way into it, I was looking for something more than 5:00 on the timer because of how challenging it was.

Thighs: Mostly plies and squats, but knowing that these are both effective exercises helps you pull through the 10 minutes.

Glutes: I would NOT recommend this entire segment for those with knee or hip problems. I'm in my early twenties and could have a better turnout, but when you are doing lifts with your back leg, they ask to turn out slightly with a straight leg, then a bent knee later, which felt uncomfortable, and almost contradicting of the instruction to keep your hips square.

Ab routine: This is not for those with poor core strength. I feel as though this is an intermediate segment with lots to share. This is entirely on abs, and you need a wall to put your feet up onto.

Stretch: This is a yoga-type division of the DVD, and a great end to a workout. The relaxing pace gives you the time to cool down but still feel the strength in the stretches.",1265068800,12,1653,4.530201342281879

Because of actually DOING the videos on a regular basis (4-6 times a week depending on my schedule), I think that I am in above average shape and rarely get noticeably sore muscles or am winded by any workout any longer.

This video changes all that. I was really looking for a new challenge and found this Core Fusion program after some research. The first time I did it: WOW. My legs especially noticed the difference, and I had a hard time getting through the thigh segment without pausing, which has not happened with another workout in years.

-The first 10 minute segment is arm work, with light hand weights. I liked the different arm and back muscles that were targeted, and though I could get through this part without too much trouble, after about 4 workouts I could see increased definition in the muscles in my shoulders and back.

-The second 10 minute segment is the leg work using a chair and long holds in some classic ballet stances with clever alterations. This part has made the biggest difference to me personally, I lost at least an inch on my thighs after a month or so and my legs STILL shake at certain points in the workout. The best leg work I ever did!

-The third 10 minute segment targets the butt and legs while using a chair for support, and lots of leg lifting in various ballet positions really lifts the rear and strengthens the standing leg.

-The fourth 10 minute segment was also very powerful and intensive, it is the abdomen segment and it was also one of the most difficult that I had encountered, with long holding postions and lots of core strengthening. I STILL can not complete the entire segment without a break or two, so it continues to challenge me.

-The fifth and final segment is the stretching portion, which is very soothing and yet lengthening. The leg stretch portion really showcases how much leg work has been done early, as I still often have shaky legs at this point.

HIGHLY recommended for those already in good physical shape and want a long term, consistent challenge!",1264550400,82,2204,4.607142857142857

I have put all other methods of exercise on hold to see what this workout will do alone and so far I am very impressed! I am 41 and really need something that shapes and sculpts without injury.

3476619,4,B001AZI236,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not someone who is ""athletic"" or ""LOVES TO WORKOUT!""  I love how working out makes me feel mentally, how it makes my body look, and that it gives me energy - but I don't wake up thinking, ""YES!  I get to work out this morning!"" if you know what I'm saying...  I basically have to ""trick"" myself into exercising by making it both fun & rewarding (i.e. do things that give me quick results).

So, that said - I like this workout a lot!  The instructors are likable, and their flexibility & strength is totally inspiring!  I'd LOVE to get to where Elisabeth is in terms of flexibility.  She's amazing.  I admit that hearing a voiceover instead of a ""live narration"" of the exercises was a little weird at first, but I got over it & do not find it distracting.  (Also, I've noticed that quite a few pilates & yoga-style DVDs have this voiceover style of instruction; I think because so much of the routine focuses on proper breathing that it'd be hard for the instructor to demonstrate the moves while instructing the viewer at the same time.)

I really love how this DVD is broken down into 5 10-minute chapters/workouts.  Each one covers a different area of the body, and somehow, knowing that each section is only 10 minutes makes the time fly by & I enjoy it more than knowing I have an hour-long workout to get through.  It's also really nice to be able to focus on a certain body area, and rotate which muscle groups I work on throughout the week.  I usually do 1, 2, or 3 of the chapters after my cardio workout, and I love the variety!

In terms of equipment needed, I use both 2- and 5-lb. weights for the upper body workout (depending on which move I'm doing).  When I first purchased this DVD, I only had 5-lb. weights & it was way too hard for me to do the tricep work!  I bought a set of 2-lb. weights to use for the routine, and they're perfect!  I know that amount of weight sounds like nothing, but the moves are intense.  I can definitely feel it the next day.  I think even Fred uses just 3-lb. weights!  The only other ""equipment"" that you need is a chair or countertop (for balance during the thigh chapter) & a yoga mat if you don't have carpeted floors.

My favorite chapters are the ones for upper body & lower body.  I like the ab section least because I think too much time is wasted & the moves aren't very effective.  Other than that, I have no complaints!

Overall, this is a great DVD for toning & strengthening.  Highly recommended!",1261008000,9,2498,4.320430107526882

3476621,4,B001AZI236,"I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5 just because I like the Pilates Plus DVD a little more. But I really do enjoy this one as well.

Upper body: I tend to neglect my upper body in my workouts, so the idea of a 10 minute routine that I can easily fit in, and covers all the major muscles, is great for me.  If you are looking for a power workout (like Cathe Friedrich) then maybe you won't like this. But really, if you are pressed for time it is great.  Just increase the weight if you need to make it more difficult.  I started with 3 lb weights, but quickly moved up to 5 lb. Will increase weight if it gets easy!

Ab routine:  If you are new to working out your abs, or aren't very strong there, this might be too difficult for you.  I was at a moderate level for traditional ab workouts and found this one just a little intense.  So, I went to the routine on the Pilates Plus DVD first, and then once I was comfortable with their style, I went back to the one on this DVD.  Also, if you are looking for a ton of crunches, and aren't open to new ideas, you won't like this. It is all about holding the crunch...for a long time.  But I can tell you, I never saw much difference in my abs from traditional workouts but have noticed a huge difference with the Core Fusion routines.

Stretch:  I really like the Core Fusion stretch routines. This one hits the back of the legs nicely, as well as lower back.  When I was younger I wasn't that into stretching, but now that I'm in my 40's I really am.

Thighs: Didn't try this one as I'm in physical therapy for my knee and don't want to complicate things.

Glutes:  I will admit that I didn't always really feel comfortable with this routine. When they did the bent leg moves I felt like I was doing something wrong. Some of this may be related to my hip dysplasia, but I could have used some more on form on this workout.",1260230400,10,1869,4.065573770491803

The best pro about this one was the set, which was absolutely beautiful. The second pro was the stretch sequence, it was a pretty good sequence. The rest of it, was very slow and dull. My mind drifted a lot during the DVD. And if you are drifting you are not concentrating on the muscles being used, so it kind of becomes pointless. Also, the narration didn't match the exercises. They would stop moving and then the voiceover would say to stop. This video is not going to be my go to video.",1260230400,3,661,4.253968253968254

So I rented this one (body sculpt) and I LOVE IT!  I am going to keep it until my Amazon order arrives later on this week. I have had the DVD for 4 days and I have done at least 2 10-min. segments each day and I cannot believe the difference I already can see and feel! No weight loss yet, but definate toning is evident immediatly!  I have a habit of ordering exercise videos and never doing them more than a handful of times b/c I simply do not see results quick enough so I get bored and quit. I love the short 10 min segments; its hard to get exercises in with 2 small children at home, so 10 - 20 min a day is SO DOABLE!!!  The music and the fact they don't talk ( just a voice over) is a little weird at first, but they certainly are not annoying and the exercises are very to the point.  You will feel sore the next day, but not to the point where you cannot move ( like the Jillian Michaels DVDs I have tried), if I am too sore to move, I am too sore to exercise.

1) no plank/push ups
2) way too much stretching.  I would guestimate 30% of the dvd is stretching.
3) long pauses during setups for leg/butt work.  So you'll just be standing there for a minute while nothing is being done on screen.
4) The workout is filled with too many pauses for stretching and setting up poses so doesn't flow and it's hard to get into a rhythm.

3476626,2,B001AZI236,"There are some exercises which aren't bad overall on this DVD, but there are issues which make this not a very enjoyable one for me to do (recognizing that 'enjoyable' and 'workout dvd' really don't go together, but hopefully you'll get what I mean).

The cuing, I think, is pretty miserable in terms of time or when a movement is supposed to begin or end.  Unless you're watching the TV very carefully, there's often little idea of how fast a movement is supposed to be and the background music doesn't help keep 'the beat' at all.  On one stretch, in particular, by the time the voiceover explains what position one should be in, it's time to immediately move on to the other side...it's pretty bad.

Even if you ARE watching the TV, it's not always easy to follow how quickly something ought to be done.  The movements aren't often well defined and the camera angles are often not set at a good angle to get an accurate sense of the full form of the movement.

And last...the ab section is something that I don't get on several levels.  I'm not a big fan of putting feet on the wall.  I mean...I've just worked out, I'm feeling kind of oogy and ... I'm supposed to plant my bare feet on the painted wall?  Even getting past that (and I've tried more than a few times!), the whole ab section is doing something that I haven't been able to figure out yet (and I've been doing pilates for a couple of years, so I don't think my abs are completely useless)...I just can't seem to figure out how these exercises are supposed to 'work' and spend a lot of time rewinding, replaying, rewatching to figure out what I'm doing wrong (and still haven't figured it out).

There is a bunch of 'wasted time' on this dvd...which isn't bad if you need time to recover but I think it could have used time more efficiently.  The stretching is pretty poor too, in my opinion.

Anyway...I was surprised, since this dvd got such decent reviews overall, but every time I do this dvd I'm reminded of these issues and thought someone else might appreciate the heads up prior to purchase.",1258329600,72,2065,4.462765957446808

Didn't care for the abs either.  I tried Pilates Plus and found it to be EVEN WORSE than this one.  I don't think either are a good use of time.

Much of the time was spent in transition with the narrators saying stuff like, ""Alignment.  Knees over ankles.  Hips over knees.  Alignment.  Core Fusion.""  (They also liked to talk in half sentences, which drove me crazy!  They seemed to have ""catch phrases"" which would be repeated over and over and OVER.)

I'm a intermediate yoga practitioner so I'm used to ""slow"" workouts.  I'm not under the impression that a workout has to equal running on a treadmill, but I did this DVD two or three times and gave up.  It just wasn't my style.  I also found some of the pose alignment in the abs section totally compromised my back and was a recipe for a back injury.  Oh and there was little to no stretching after the sequences.  (Token stretches thrown in at the end, nothing serious.)

We like to mix things up so I can see doing the Firm's full body with cardio one day, followed by a body sculpt workout the next then a day off. Rinse and repeat.

3476741,5,B001AZI236,"UPDATE #2: Aug 9, 2010- I've been doing this dvd along with other ore Fusion DVDs and the Bar Method since Jan 2010 and let me tell you, this WORKS!! I look better now than I did at 18- seriously.  I've been doing core fusion dvds 2-3x a week and bar method about 2x a week (with a few other dvd's thrown in) and I cannot recommend this highly enough. Granted it takes discipline, but I carve out an hour after the child goes to bed 5x a week and do this, no excuses.  The results have been worth every minute and the more results I have gotten the more motivated I am to continue.  For anyone who is unsure, BUY this DVD (and the thighs and glutes and pilates plus ones- I think they even have a bundle of the 3 dvds now).  Even though I have other workout dvds, these and the Bar Method have become my go-to dvds.  Yes, they aren't the most exciting, but once you see the results you are motivated.  At this point Liz and Fred are like old friends, and I just love them.  These DVDs have given me so much confidence that I had lacked for years.  Bless Liz and Fred for making these and making the otherwise expensive and exclusive Core Fusion workouts available to those of us without the financial or geographical means to go to the Exhale spa.  The best part is, I haven't even been doing cardio and have lost so much fat- my figure has just melted away into something better. BUY these DVDs!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This dvd is TOUGH! I thought I was in relatively good shape but after doing these sets I realized how out of shape I am! The best part is that there are five 10 minute segments, each focusing on an area of the body or stretching.  I'm a new mom, post c-section, and not only do I NEED to tone up my abs, but I also have very little time in which to go to the gym or even just work out without being interrupted.  The great thing is, I can steal 10 minutes here and there while baby is sleeping, get a full workout in (albeit broken up) and I know if I keep on working on this video and eating right I should be back to pre-baby tummy in no time.  Not to mention the instructors have tremendous skill (and Elisabeth Halfpapp's physique is my inspiration) and the video is well narrated, filmed well showing several angles and skill level options with the exercises, and the music is nice.  Plus, you can turn off the music OR the narration which is really nice depending on your preference. The focus on core and posture is really helpful for those of us who do not have the best posture, and helps one find how strong the body *should* feel all the time.  This is a great workout dvd and I highly recommend it.

UPDATE: I've been doing this video intermittently (and not as often as I would like) for 3 months now and it has given me my figure back! My pre-baby jeans are actually *loose* now and my hubby noticed my butt has gotten a lot tighter- and I didn't even ask him, he just commented recently! The proof is in the puttin' and Core Fusion WORKS! I'm actually more motivated now that I'm seeing results.

Since Amazon had a good price on these I figured I'd give them a try. I'd done Winsor Pilates in the past and like that, but the Core Fusion workout is so AMAZING! The Body Sculpt DVD is segmented into five 10  minute workouts that I thought I would be able to blow through no problem. Boy was I wrong! The first workout is the upper body and I was about half done with it when I noticed what a sweat I was working up and how hard I was working! It burned, but that fantastic ""Yes, you're really working out these muscles, yes they still exist!"" burn. The thigh sculpting workout had my legs shaking like crazy! The glutes workout has already made my bum feel tighter and the abs workout is SO hard, but I swear the results are almost instant. Of course the stretching at the end is amazing. I can't say enough good things about this workout tape. It does jump right into the workout, so on your first time, maybe watch it once thru just to know what you need to be on the lookout for. Overall it's an AMAZING workout that will help you lose the lbs, make you want to do it, and give you that extra encouragement to make a healthier choices and get the body you want!

This works in the same method, after an intense burning workout (the glute and core sections put my muscles on fire, and I LOVE IT!), they stretch out afterwards. I tore my meniscus a year ago and I gained so much weight, this is putting me on the fast track to get into shape again. I'm purchasing pilates plus, and after I master those 2 I want to move onto the ab & arms and thighs & glutes. This will definitely give you the lean body you are looking for!

(I used two small plastic soda bottles filled with water for handweights, and grabbed an ovenmitt for the stretch that called for a towel or strap for the easier version)  The combination of the toning and stretches for the upper body have unstuck the last of a stuck shoulderblade that I've been working on for years.  I can now feel my upper ribcage on that side expand and contract when I breathe, something I haven't felt in years!  I'm going to finish the remaining 4 workouts today, one by one.

I used to take Core Fusion classes at the Exhale Santa Monica location and literally jumped for joy when I found out they were starting a DVD collection (and would no longer have to shell out $20 a class)....introducing CORE FUSION BODY SCULPT. This video has literally transformed my body, which, for someone who spends an inordinate amount of time teaching AND working out is no small feat. I do this video 3 times a week and sometimes break the video up into small parts to do throughout the day. What I love about this DVD is how it allows anyone to do it regardless of equipment (all you need is a chair and use soup cans if you don't have access to weights!) and the informative way in which both Fred and Elisabeth instruct you. Personally, I quit my gym because I found it incredibly boring to huff and puff the calories away on the elliptical. This DVD will give you long, lean legs and one seriously perky tushy. My mother, who is quite possibly the most critical woman alive, even commented on the amazing results it's given me. She's a pilates instructor and even SHE found the video remarkable -- my poor father has been forced to do the video with her and even he can't stop singing its' praises.

Nice tempo, good explanations, great voices to listen to for one hour, extra bonus for the core. I am in pretty good shape but I always have a big burn during the excercises and sometimes I need a breathing break. I absolutely love it.",1250035200,4,369,4.068493150684931
3476801,4,B001AZI236,"This workout was great.  I completed it about 15 minutes ago and I can definitely feel it right now.  The workout is broken into 5 10-minute segments which is a format that I love as it means you can break it down for a shorter workout and even if you do the whole thing is doesn't feel like an eternity because of the changing segments.  The general idea is to do strengthening exercises followed by stretches to lengthen the muscles.

Overview of the segments:
Arms: this was probably my least favorite segment.  I prefer the arms segment on 10 minute solutions pilates perfect body.  It was about 6-7 minutes of arms work and then 3-4 of stretching the arms.  It felt rushed and the cueing seemed a little off.  Also, I just didn't find it very hard.  For this segment you need light handweights.

Thighs: this segment was excellent.  They claim you need a chair to do these excercises however if you have reasonably strong thighs and good balance it's not necessary.  These exercises make you feel your thighs, mine started shaking like crazy at one point and are really effective.

Glutes: I think this was the hardest segment on the DVD.  I really like that they had a segment devoted especially to glutes, a lot of video through them in with thighs and I don't think they work very hard.  In this segment you're glutes will work hard, and a chair is an absolute necessity.  I had to take several breaks during it but am looking forward to working up to the full segment.

Abs: I'm glad this segment was short because although it was good work for the abs it was a bit boring.  You put your feet up on the wall and hold yourself in a sit-up position (don't think this sounds hard? neither did I but try doing it for about 8 minutes) and then do variations from there. Not my favorite ab workout but effective, I definitely felt my abs straining.

Stretch:  I really like it when DVDs have a specific long segment devoted to stretching.  That said, this was not my favorite stretching segment.  I wish the stretches had been held a little less long and there had been more different stretches.  It ended and I still felt the need to do some other stretches to really feel stretched out.  But the stretches they did were good, and there's something to be said for holding them for so long and really makin your body relax into the stretch.

Overall, I definitely recommend purchasing this video.  It's a really effective workout and I certainly liked all the segments enough to continue doing them even if they weren't my favorite.  Also I really liked that they had two instructors, a man and a woman, and showed simpler variations of many of the moves, including when it was best to rest if you needed it.  One con I haven't mentioned yet (and this is a personal preference thing) is that the instruction is voice-over which is not my favorite and I sometimes felt like the cueing was not right on.  Final thought: For $15 worth it!",1249516800,34,2938,4.500945179584121
3476802,5,B001AZI236,"I just started using this DVD a few weeks ago and it is fantastic!  It has helped me take inches off my thighs and butt that I couldn't lose before.  It's composed of five10-minute sections:  arms & shoulders, thighs, butt, abs, and stretch.  The exercises use small movements with lots of reps - your muscles stay in a working zone through most of the 10 minutes, so you really feel a deep burn by the end. The two instructors are wonderful at encouraging you to keep moving through the burning sensation.  Having two of them is great since throughout the workout, they are always demonstrating beginner and advanced modifications.

The arms and shoulders section requires some light hand weights (5lbs was too much for me.  It seems to be inspired by classical strength training moves, but given a bit of a twist.  The thighs and the butt segments use a chair as a barre for some ballet-inspired exercises - these sections are difficult, but really produce results.  The ab workout is also challenging.  My only issue was that it requires you to brace your feet on a wall, which in my apartment, does not allow me to watch the TV.  Though using a voiceover prevents wasted time in this DVD, there are times where the cuing is lacking.  They often make subtle changes to their movements and don't mention it on the voiceover.  This means you sometimes need to sacrifice your position to make sure you're still keeping up with them.

This program provides something a little different from most workout DVDs of this type.  It seems to be a very effective and challenging mix of training styles.  Best of all, it leaves you feeling relaxed and energized, not strained (well, you'll be sore the next day...).  I definitely recommend giving this one a try!",1248998400,13,1753,4.695081967213115

I have not achieved the packaging picture (but I believe that with this it's achievable) but I love this.

3476804,5,B001AZI236,"I have never written a review of a DVD before, but I couldn't help myself after only my 2nd day of doing Core Fusion.

I have tried so many things over the years regarding exercise -- killed myself in the gym lifting weights for years and spending hours on the Precor, but never got to my goal.

I was into yoga for a brief time but it became difficult for me to be able to work the classes into my schedule in relation to the gym schedule. Regardless of this, I always found yoga classes to be the most rewarding mentally and physically. This is what made me choose Core Fusion; I knew it'd be based on exercise principles that I have connected with in the past.

The last few weeks I begun doing pilates via on demand on cable; came to Amazon to find the most popular pilates dvd -- and lo and behold I discovered Core Fusion. The more I read about the philosophy behind exhale and Core Fusion, the more I realize that this is the perfect type of exercise for someone like me. As another reviewer stated, this is a ""thinking person's"" workout. I personally already feel my spine and back becoming stronger and my posture so much better. I also feel motivated; if you respond better to positive reinforcement than negative, you will also enjoy this DVD a great deal. It is soothing yet gives you a deep burn in your muscles.

I got the other 2 in the set, but have yet to try them. Core Fusion will truly help you establish the elusive mind/body connection and in turn, you will become stronger physically and mentally. I love it!!!",1247875200,7,1533,4.368421052631579

Core Fusion will definitely tone your problem areas and is gentle on the joints.  I also enjoy the fact that it is a challenge.  It is going to take me some time to take on the more advanced moves.  I don't like an exercise video that I can perfect in one use.  I know that I will benefit from every exercise on this dvd - the arms, the legs, the abs, & the stretches.

I am determined to get into shape but consider myself a complete beginner to exercise. I have had so much trouble finding a fitness dvd that can truely cater to complete beginners and because of this, I have a personal library of fitness dvds collecting dust. I also consider myself a difficult person to please when it comes to fitness since, I personally do not enjoy traditional exercise that include, crunches, lunges, and all the other moves we learned in gym class! I know these moves are highly effective at achieving results but cannot help the fact that they completely bore me!

I enjoyed this dvd because it incorporates moves from pilates, yoga and ballet, all of which I've always wanted to try. There are four 10 minute rather intense workouts for your abs, glutes, arms/upper body, and thighs. Each section includes modifications which even as a beginner are difficult (but not impossible as they have been with other dvds) because I am not strong or flexible enough to do the moves. The fifth segment is a 10 min stretch that I do after I complete the workout to keep from getting too sore the next day.

Bottom line this is the first dvd I enjoyed that as a beginner was capable of doing. This is the first time I actually look forward to working out and I owe it all to this dvd!",1246060800,14,1415,4.45945945945946

They are broken down by upper body, thighs, gluteus (butt), abs, & stretches.  You can do which ever one you feel you need targeting, but if you do them all, that is when you get the full workout.  After every segment the instructors do stretches to take the tension off your muscles.  They even have 2 bonus workouts that are only like 10-15 minutes as well.

I'm the type who loves pilates, no cardio workout tapes (not a fan).  The first time I used it, I felt good, relaxed, lengthened & stretched out. By the next day you see a difference.  You don't feel sore until the end of the next day.  Every workout you do no matter what it is, you are going to have soreness until you continue to do it regularly.

After reading the reviews here then viewing clips I took a chance and bought it and now I'm hooked. It's challenging without being exhausting and I even feel invigorated enough after the 50 minute workout to attempt the bonus ""flat back/round back"" bonus feature (I say attempt because it truly is the most challenging core sequence I have ever done).  The 50 minutes goes by quite fast and I love how it's broken up into 10 minute segments, that way you can really push yourself since you know it's going to be over quickly. The movements are intense and the instructors demonstrate beginner modifications along with the more advanced exercises.  The instruction is very good and easy to follow, not distracting or annoying like most exercise DVDs. The music is good as far as these things go, not overwhelming, peaceful but enough to keep up the energy.  The workout targets the upper body, thighs, glutes, and abs, followed by a 10 minute stretch and cool down.

It's split into five 10 minute sections-
Upper body
thighs,
glutes,
core and
stretch (and also a the bonus sections).
So you can use whatever you feel like or all of them.

I do feel as much of a workout as when I go to the studio class.
It's a great DVD with precise instruction.
I throw in some cardio and I have a complete workout.",1234656000,13,434,3.8222222222222224

3476864,5,B001AZI236,"This is an execellent work-out program, nicely divided into 5 ten-minute sections so that you can do a full-body workout or focus on specific areas.  The areas addressed are upper body, thighs, glutes, abs and stretching.  Though there is an entire section on stretching, balancing stretches are included in each workout.  I think of the pleasurable stretches as the ""reward"" for the intense toning. I consider myself quite fit, but this DVD seriously works my muscles - especially the abs section - ouch!  But great results in a very short time!  Highly recommended . . .",1233532800,8,572,4.916666666666667
3476865,5,B001AZI236,"I've been lifting heavy and working large muscles and doing lots of cardio for 6 months. I've lost 45 lbs. When I saw that this uses small weights, I was sceptical. This worked all the supportive smaller muscles as well as the larger ones, I was aching in a good way for two days! I love it. I came back two days later and did more. I can tell that it's going to do more for my quads and glutes than squats and lunges, because the burn is so much more intense. My butt would recover quickly from standard exercises, but for 24 hours my muscles are tight after these workouts. If you're a fitness model, do these before a shoot. Brilliant. The arm exercises are awesome and very challenging. I highly recommend this DVD for body building, you won't get big, but you'll get strong. Combined with cardio, you'll get ripped! I would really like that butt on the cover, can I have it please?",1233446400,17,886,4.343373493975903
3476866,4,B001AZI236,"This is a great DVD for a few reasons:
It is broken up into 10 minute segments, targeting different body parts, so you can do as much or as little as you please.
Each 10 minute segment gives a great workout for that body part.
It can be modified easily if you're just starting out. It's also great if you're sick of doing crunches and squats. I like the instructors; they set a good pace and explain the movements and the modifications. Each 10 minutes is challenging but not overwhelmingly so.",1233100800,7,494,4.43956043956044

The instructors are precise and guide you through each position very calmly. Especially recommended for thos who like yoga or Tai Chi and intend to tone & stretch the muscles to build up strength.",1232236800,5,475,5.089743589743589

3476871,5,B001AZI236,"The first thing that impressed me about this video is its intelligence.  It's a thinking person's workout.  Exercises are strong on authentic Lotte Berk since that was a significant part of this couple's background, with additions from Pilates, yoga and classical weight training.  They do an excellent job of talking you through the exercises, explaining what it will do for your body, thereby keeping you motivated from a positive place, which is so much nicer than the commonly used negative motivational techniques where somebody is screaming you through a breakneck pace.  They have you concentrate on how your body is feeling the exercise, stopping momentarily if you need to, then picking it up again - instead of counting monotonous repetitions for you.  This approach is so much more pleasant and sensible.  The workout is muscle toning, organized as interval training.  Interval training has been proven by medical research to be much preferred for promoting fat loss and heart reserve capacity, instead of long term cardio.  The pacing promotes the mind-body connection and focus, which reminds me of my ballet training from years ago, or hatha yoga.  You have a chance to breathe and think during the exercises, without feeling additional stress due to the exercising.  Much appreciated after a hectic day at work.

The video had a warm, intimate, personal trainer feel to it with the husband and wife team demonstrating the exercises together and instructing by means of a voiceover.  They alternated showing the advanced version of an exercise and clearly indicated which person you should watch if that's the level you wanted.  Setting is what I call ""New Age living room,"" lovely dcor, warm earthtones, water feature, and subdued lighting, plenty of camera shots from various angles.  Music so unobtrusive I didn't even notice what it was, although there is a music only option in the special features after you get tired of the instructional.  My husband really liked the fact that a man was showing the exercises also - funny how the same movement can look a little different on a man.  He also liked the fact that it was a husband and wife team instead of a group of women.  We're pressed for time, like to do things together, and this video fills the bill nicely.  No more scheduling TV time for mutually exclusive workouts.  Top quality production, first class all the way.  I think this delightful couple with impressive credentials has set a new standard for fitness videos, and I look forward to more offerings from them in years to come.",1231632000,213,2562,4.969483568075117
3476872,5,B001AZI236,"This is a very ""do-able"" workout because it is in 10 minute intervals so that just when you think you can't - you can! I've only been doing it for a short time but I have started to feel a difference already. I love that the instructors give detailed support throughout. I am not usually one to write reviews of products, but this one is definitely worth the time and trouble. Try it!!",1231372800,8,385,4.287671232876712
3476873,5,B001AZI236,"During a Core Fusion class at Exhale my legs would shake non-stop.  After 50 min of the cd my legs still shake, that's how I know I'm getting the same benefits without going to the studio!  Another wonderful feature is how the cd is broke down in 10 min workouts.  Having three kids I don't always get the time to do an entire workout.  I can do 10 min and come back an hour later and do another 10 min.  The benefits are the same and now I really have no excuse.  Thanks for bringing Core Fusion to my home!",1231286400,12,508,4.03
3476874,5,B001AZI236,I am a 45 year old man who has taken class with Fred and Elisabeth but do not have the time to attend their Exhale studio classes regularly...I found these DVDs to be awesome.  The DVD's have allowed me to develop a daily at home routine using Core Fusion stretching and strengthening exercises on my own while getting instructions and reminders on how to perform them properly. The end result has been that I rarely suffer from back aches and sciatica that had plagued me before.  Thank you exhale's Fred & Elisabeth for sharing this amazing routine!,1230076800,27,551,4.670103092783505

My abs were totally week after my back to back pregnancies.  Typical gym exercises did nothing but land me at the Physical Therapist.  I loved yoga, loved pilates and loved ""working out.""  I just never had time to do them all.  Then, I found the DVD's.  I am stronger and leaner.  I also am seeing my flexibility increase.  As a former marathon runner who was constantly tight, that is no small feat!  I also get the sense of calm that I get from yoga.  I am totally hooked.",1229904000,10,669,4.181102362204724
3476876,5,B001AZI236,"If you enjoy Bar Method or Lotte Berk, you will love this workout.  I love the format of this dvd.  You can do a quick 10 minutes workout or a full body longer workout.  I wanted some new bar style workouts but don't always have a full 40 minutes every day and sometimes just want to focus on one body part.  So this is perfect for me as an add on to a cardio or if I am just short on time.

The workout itself is the perfect level of difficulty - hard but not so difficult I put off doing it.  I haven't had this particular workout long enough to see results specific to this dvd, but this style of workout gives me great results, especially in the buns and abs areas.",1229644800,15,669,3.992481203007519
3476877,5,B001AZI236,"I'm always looking for something fun and results oriented to keep me motivated. This DVD totally fits the bill on that front. It's a really interesting and different approach to a total body workout broken up into do-able 10-minute sections that completely make me ""feel the burn"" AND keep me interested. The instructors do a great job of explaining each exercise clearly and showing alternate moves. Core Fusion seems to be all about small muscle movements and lots of reps so you're not working with heavy weights. However, you are repeating specific exercises for a longer period than you normally would so by the time you're done with each 10-min segment you really know you put some work into that muscle group. My personal faves are the ballet inspired chair workouts (amazing for the rear-end) and the arm workouts (awesome tri/bicept routine).

If you like this one, check out Core Fusion Pilates Plus. I bought both DVDs at once and am really pleased. Pilates Plus features the same instructors but with exercises that target the abs. The fact that I not only finished this DVD, but am doing it regularly is a testament in itself as I normally can't get through a pilates workout (find them boring in many cases) and I hate working my abs. I may be imagining things but I do feel a bit tighter all around after doing these workouts for a little while. Both Core Fusion DVDs have quickly become part of my regular workout rotation.",1229040000,169,1439,4.733067729083666
