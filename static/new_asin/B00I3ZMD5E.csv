6248670,5,B00I3ZMD5E,"I had to watch this movie 4 times to really understand the odd emotional response I was having to it. The only way I can think of to  describe this movie is to say it's psychologically erotic. With no nudity or graphic sex, the author and director manage to get you into the head of an attractive straight man who is struggling with the knowledge he has a gay secret admirer that has fallen in love with him. You experience every nuance of the emotional roller coaster he and his girlfriend experience as they work their way through and out of this uncomfortable situation. Great filming and acting blend with the unique story and directing to make this one seriously sexy movie. Definitely got put in the small favorites niche of my DVD library.",1418083200,12,746,4.567164179104478
6248671,4,B00I3ZMD5E,"Set in 1989 we meet Boaz, he is a student in Tel Aviv, he is doing well at his studies and is expecting to get a scholarship. He is living with his girlfriend and seems perfectly happy - he has the libido of a sixteen year old in Viagra and she seems very reciprocal.

Then he starts to get love letters to his mail box. They start off tentatively and then get more intense. The thing is they are from an older man who clearly knows a lot about him. He starts to suspect everyone and as the confessions become more intense - he starts to change. He has also done his military service and parts of that are told in flashback - and it is a case of `boys will be boys'. Boaz now starts to question his sexuality and the fabric of his life starts to unravel - to say any more would be too much of a reveal.

This is a thought provoking film with very strong central performances. The subject matter is handled rather well though some may not agree based on personal experiences. This is not a love story per se but there are some scenes of a very sexual content. It is in Hebrew with good subtitles and is one that very much adds to the body of gay themed cinema and if you like World cinema too then you should get something out of this film.",1417651200,3,1239,4.094650205761317
6248672,2,B00I3ZMD5E,"Just finished watchng ""Snails In The Rain"" released by Mozer and Regal Entertainment through TLA Relasing.
""Snails In The Rain"" could have been an intense psychological drama that examined the rippling effects of obession and love, yet if falls far short of this lofty expectation even though all the elements are there in this movie.
Set in Tel Aviv during 1989, ""Snails In The Rain"" explores a key moment in linguistics student's Boaz's life - he's anixously waiting word to see if he got a scholarship that would allow him to continue on with the next phase of his studies.  He's working a menial labor job to support himself and his live-in girlfriend.  And then the letters from a stalker start arriving in his mailbox that set in motition a chain of conflicting emotions in Boaz - who perhaps isn't what he appears to be.
While ""Snails In The Rain"" starts off as a tense pyschological mystery that hints at exploring the mysteries of the human heart; none of the characters raise above their own petty, selfish needs to get at the heart of the mystery - who is sending the letters.
Boaz's girlfriend does put the clues together; but instead of helping Boaz, she seems more intent on setting a trap to test his loyalty to her.
There are no redeemable characters in ""Snails In The Rain.""
Two-and-a-half Stars Only.",1417651200,13,1318,4.701298701298701
6248673,4,B00I3ZMD5E,"An incredibly good looking main character is a good start for a film.  But the intriguing plot kept me interested, too.  Though it's easy to imagine a scenario where another man sends you repeated anonymous notes claiming an attraction or even love for you, we don't often see this plot in film; in fact, I can't remember ever seeing it before.  For our handsome leading man, it caused him to notice potential senders everywhere he turned.  And the repressed gay side of this heterosexual character was both intrigued and unsettled by the attention.  Where will this all lead?  That's the film.",1417132800,11,594,4.8316831683168315
6248674,3,B00I3ZMD5E,"It's not very often that I buy a DVD for the sake of eye candy, but I happened to catch a trailer for SNAILS IN THE RAIN on the internet recently, and what I saw was quite provocative.  I checked Amazon to see if it was available, and as the cost was not prohibitive, I ordered it on impulse.  I watched it as soon as I arrived and I think I got my money's worth.  That is, my money's worth of eye candy, anyway.

Boaz, played by the amazingly handsome Israeli model Yoav Reuveni, is a linguistics student living with his girlfriend and nervously awaiting a letter confirming his acceptance into a scholarship program.  He checks his PO Box daily and one day he receives a letter revealing the obsessive love of another man.  Annoyed at first, he begins to wonder who the letter could be from.  When a second and then a third letter arrive, he begins to question his sexual attractions.  As his world unravels he becomes somewhat paranoid and it appears that virtually everyone who crosses his path is a possible secret admirer.

The film lasts a mere 82 minutes, but it did manage to keep my attention, if for no other reason than the fact that the director finds endless excuses to show Boaz in various stages of undress.  While Boaz becomes more and more confused, we learn that he has had several men in his past attempt to seduce him.  I was not put off by the sheer number of guys who stare at Boaz or make advances as the film progresses; I must emphasize that he is that good looking as to make this facet of the film pretty much plausible.

I did not expect the ending; I didn't really dislike it, I just didn't expect it.  By the way, the only hint we get of the meaning of the title is two snails crawling in the rain at the end of the film.  While SNAILS IN THE RAIN is hardly great cinema, it's certainly worth a rent or even a purchase if you like to look at handsome men.  Two stars for plot, four for photography and three for arousing, sexy scenes.",1416355200,41,1965,4.287262872628726

6248676,4,B00I3ZMD5E,"In this sexy, intelligent and emotional Israeli film set in Tel Aviv in 1989, Boaz (male model Yoav Reuveni) is a linguistics student committed to his loving girlfriend, Noa (Moran Rosenblatt). But soon Boaz questions his life when he begins receiving a series of obsessive love letters from another man. Yoav, is excellent in the main part of this movie and clearly shows through his acting and actions that he is conveying every type of inner conflict he can muster. On the one hand he loves his girlfriend and on the other he has to admit that the letter stimulate things in him he doesn't want to admit. He begins to become very paranoid and takes it out on everyone around him. I loved how the story unfolded in a good amount of time and I certainly will not tell you how this ended, no way will I tell you who he went with, I recommend you watch it for yourself and see.",1491436800,3,876,4.380368098159509

I won't spoil it, but it left things unresolved in a very weird way.  I don't need American style ""neat"" endings, but this was creepy. Get a grip and don't ruin other people's lives (i.e. the poor schlemazel girl  you marry).

6248736,4,B00I3ZMD5E,"This is truly a sophisticated emotional drama that bleeds the pure bliss of sexuality. A wonderful film of truth and most of all brilliant performances that lead the viewer into a flawlessly performed experience in acting. Its a story of one mans inner hidden self. Boaz has a girlfriend and is dedicated to the love for her. Soon he is being contacted by mysterious letter that knows about his past attraction to men. Soon Boaz is consumed and somewhat haunted by the personal letters. His mind races and mixes with thinking questions, Who is doing this? Who are the letters from? Who knows about my attraction?

I really enjoyed this deep and sensual exploration of hidden secrets and the ultimate reality of who you are. The secrets and lies can control, cloud and destroy. A beautiful film with a wonderful written story, sexy in tone and displays itself as a thick drama.

What truly stands out is the ultimate tension and the paranoia controlling Boaz. It plays on the viewer and you cant help but feel the tension and the ultimate dread inside Boaz as he is afraid his past and his world around him will crumble. The letters haunt him. Every visit to the mail, a new letter of ultimate obsession and deep inner thoughts and actions from his past come to light one letter at a time.

Also something that stands out is the chemistry of all the players. They control their parts and give off a vibe of pure excellence in the art of performing. Starring the striking and absolutely sexy and handsome Yoav Reuveni who in real life is a male model and trust me you can see why. His looks are very sexy and beautiful and fit the part perfect. He is able to control the reality of the character of Boaz into a crystal clear setting of building a perfect character. I think what is so amazing is this is Yoav Reuvenis first acting feature. He aces his part and gives it his all to the character and for the viewer watching.

Here is a man (very beautiful actor) who is confused and riddled with contradictions about his sexuality and desires, tempted at every touch and turn by many admirers, one of whom writes anonymous love letters,  yet the basic questions are never answered properly. Oh yes, he finally does the honourable thing after dragging us through what seems like hours of psychological torment,  but the film winds up by pretending there is a 'happy ever after' which is a farce.  In spite of a marriage and child, this man's psychological torment will exist long after the film has ended. A sequel might produce something more explosive and watchable. Who knows?

I caught that right away, and thats what kept me watching.
The story held me in a few different ways, but mostly from the two leading characters who led me through everyday situations as though I were sitting with them. Their relationship was believable, normal, as in not too excitednot too dull.
The movie had great timing and the right amount of suspense. The storyline kept me wondering what the leading man would do next, especially given his dilemma. Adding to the mystery were the mailbox scenes, slightly suggesting Yoav Reuveni (leading man) may have been involved in some covert mission. As a viewer, I was anxious to uncover every piece of the puzzle.
In real life, there are human scenarios that sometimes go deeper than black and white, and this film genuinely captured the emotional roller coaster of one man charting the waters of life. But the best performance in my eyes came from Moran Rosenblatt, (leading woman) who held herself together while her man went through his issues, even as he blatantly made his decisions without her input. It was refreshing to see a woman portray a patient and loving partner, fighting her inner torture without becoming a royal bitch. Her character was solid.
The ending had the perfect amount of indecision leading up to the final resolution. The secrets were unveiled in a manner that matched the timing of the filmnot too soon, and not too late.
Written by Yariv Mozer, who also portrayed a teacher, Snail in the Rain seems to be the result of someone dedicated to creating art on the big screen.",1422403200,2,1778,4.7387096774193544

8638979,4,B00I3ZMD5E,"There might be a great movie in here somewhere, but it somehow got lost. What we are left with is a visually wonderful film with fairly good performances and an enigmatic presentation. There are too many scenes where it is easy to identify the character's perspective to have the ending be the one presented. The acting by the producer of the movie as the professor was the one blatant mistake in casting. The professor's character lacks depth and the acting is barely passable. Perhaps the movie would have been better having another actor better qualified taken on the role. The same criticism can be levied at the actress portraying Boah's mother. Her acting is grating at best.",1522368000,,681,4.829059829059829

8638986,1,B00I3ZMD5E,"Yes, the male character (Boaz) is very handsome.  But he has no real definition, other than his body.  He never resolves his homosexual feelings in a responsible way for himself and his girlfriend.  He seethes with conflict throughout the film, and in the end winds up marrying his girlfriend and having two kids (maybe more ultimately).  That's NOT a resolution (except, of course, to Christian fundamentalists--but this is Israel, so no excuse).

Boaz's girlfriend/wife is beyond belief.  After he suddenly grabs her and rapes her, doggy style, she's naturally traumatized.  But all she can say afterward is ""It hurt"" and ""Don't ever do it again.""  I'd have kicked him in the crotch and moved out, no matter how handsome he is.

Later, when she figures out who the anonymous man who writes Boaz love letters is--yes, she reads all Boaz's private mail--and confronts the letter writer, she tells him, ""Leave Boaz alone.""  As though it was all one-sided, even though Boaz has saved every letter, has raped her doggy-style, and cries out that he's suffocating with her.  But at the end, they're married, one kid here, one on the way, and she smiles happily.  Does she honestly think that Boaz will never take up gay sex again?

Finally, the depiction of gay life--the furtive sex with strangers in dark places, the endless cruising, the just caring about getting off--is reminiscent in its ugliness of the gay bar scene in that beyond-dreck Otto Preminger movie ""Advise and Consent.""  Unlike in that movie, though, no one commits suicide in this one.  Although the anonymous letter writer is probably on the verge of it.  But that's this movie's only saving grace.

(In all fairness, this shows gay life in Israel in 1989, so it might have been much bleaker then than it is now.  Fast forward to 2017, and it's a pretty good guess that Boaz is in Tel Aviv's famed gay pride parade with his equally hunky lover--that is, if Boaz somewhat kept his looks--while his wife stews bitterly over the miserable life she's had.  She shouldn't have ignored all the red--make that crimson--flags back in 1989!)

Highly recommended--by Christian fundamentalists and ultra-orthodox Jews everywhere.",1498176000,2,2183,4.961432506887053
