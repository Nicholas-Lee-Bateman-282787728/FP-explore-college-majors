3531649,5,B001DJ7PX2,"Many movies have told the story of the mysterious unknown hunter tracking human prey. Even though you've seen the premise before, you'll find yourself holding your breath as you watch this film.

Quim (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is making a road trip to see his ex-girlfriend and maybe patch things up between them. He stops for gas and has an encounter with Bea (Mara Valverde). He realizes too late that Bea has stolen his wallet. So, when he sees her car ahead in the distance he decides to follow her.

This is a particularly deserted stretch of road that winds through the forests and mountains of rural Spain. Both Quim and Bea are stranded when their cars are disabled by gunshots. Together they flee into the forest to escape their relentless pursuers.

There are some surprising twists and turns in the plot. To say more would give away too much.

""King of the Hill"" is very well made. The cinematography is stunning. Sbaraglia and Valverde took home the Festival Trophy for Best Actor and Actress at the 2008 Screamfest in LA for their performances. Director Gonzalo Lpez-Gallego won the Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver at the 2008 Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival.

The DVD has audio in either Spanish or English; subtitles are available in Spanish and English. There is also captioning in English for the hearing impaired. Do yourself a favor and skip the dubbed version. The original Spanish version is far, far superior. You'll catch a lot more emotion with the original language track, even if you're using subtitles.

Parents should be aware that, although the DVD is unrated, the theatrical release had a well deserved ""R"" rating for sex and violence. The movie is disturbing. There are no noble or heroic characters here.",1236124800,10,1748,4.888513513513513
8293722,4,B001DJ7PX2,a well and fast paced film that leaves you wondering till the end.  kept my interest with storyline and acting. i'd recommend it.,1526947200,,129,4.608695652173913
8293723,4,B001DJ7PX2,"Made in 2007 this Spanish film is one that went under the radar which was a shame. It is all about a man imaginatively called `Quim' - pronounced `Keem' but still a cracking name. He is off to meet his ex girlfriend and try to put back his failed relationship back together, when he stops to fill up his car with petrol. There he has an encounter with a young and very light fingered young lady. He then heads off up this lonely mountain road.

Then out of the blue he gets shot at - despite owning a Volvo (with an NCAP rating of 4 I believe) he still gets hit. Only after he tries to leave does he realise what real trouble he is in.

Now there are a few plot holes here or rather some loose ends that I have only really realised on reflection. The plot is basic but the reveal or should I say reveals are good enough to prompt more than at least a couple of raised eyebrows. Good performances all round too; please note this is not a horror in the sense of blood and gore but more of a psychological thriller type. In Spanish with good sub titles - a film for those who really do like their films to be off the beaten track.",1423872000,2,1127,4.072072072072072
8293724,5,B001DJ7PX2,Really good plot. Moves quickly. I didn't see the ending coming when I first viewed this. Worth watching again and again.,1400284800,,121,4.809523809523809
8293725,5,B001DJ7PX2,"This Movie Was Really Weird To Me It Was what I Call A What Ever Movie, the type of movie that you watch and then you sit back and when some one ask about the film you say what ever something to watch",1379116800,,200,3.6744186046511627
8293726,3,B001DJ7PX2,"this film is like no other I've seen. it really develops the characters in the story line and keeps your attention throughout the film.i would label this film as strange and exotic, horror and compassionate. really one of a kind.",1345420800,,229,4.75
8293727,2,B001DJ7PX2,"I'm all for Spanish foreign films and I was really looking forward to seeing this one since I love to be at the edge of my seat covered in suspense. This movie however, when it was near to becoming a real riveting thriller just took all the wrong moves. The characters can be likable but they're not giving a lot of development that its very easy to stop caring for them. Worst of all, the film takes a turn for the melodrama that doesn't fit in and isn't at all very successful.

The cast is fine and the premise is more than interesting, but when it comes to the parts that are suppose to be shocking, scary, and disturbing it just comes off weak and, dare I say it, almost boring.",1295395200,,683,4.213740458015267
8293728,5,B001DJ7PX2,"this kind of movie has been done before of course but the way this one has been done is great. don't miss it. the suspense through out works well. great camera work, acting and direction. theres also surprises too. its won awards because its a quality film. like i say, don't miss out.",1285459200,,285,4.39622641509434
8293729,4,B001DJ7PX2,"From the start this film takes you as a passenger and puts you into the mindset of the lead cast! You are as lost as this guy. A sniper takes out his tire and then he is hunted and stalked! Very original and very realistic as this is something that could happen to anyone. Definitely worth the money! Infact, i'm going to rewatch it today. With all the ""thrillers"" out there such as Sorority Row (LOL) this stands above the rest. Chilling ending.",1277337600,,446,4.385542168674699
8293730,5,B001DJ7PX2,"I haven't yet seen this highly interesting-looking piece of work; my 5 stars are simply to counter the nonsense served up below by someone called ""G. Teslovich"" - I highly recommend you don't read his/her self-righteous, indignant ""review"", bloated with plot spoilers which s/he can't be bothered to muster the courtesy to flag and which will certainly spoil any enjoyment you may derive from the movie. So my 5 stars are, therefore, in support of all those who devoted time and energy to making their movie, in hopes they get the enthusiastic audiences their commitment deserves, and no more arrogant sanctimony from armchair ""critics"".",1246406400,6,637,5.134615384615385
8293731,1,B001DJ7PX2,"(1.) The cinematography is no more outstanding than anyone with a hand held camera in a beautiful wooded countryside would produce. Credit should be given to the beauty of nature not to someone being able to walk and hold a camera.
(2.) Highly improbable events such as being lost by driving just a few miles on one of only two country roads in a tourist area with cops and a gas station. Two boys being able to sniper kill on a single shot from nearly a mile away with an inexpensive scoped hunting rifle. Adult actors, while making one dumb decision after another, being easily pursued (if you can call it that when they have a car) by walking kid actors. At the end the surviving adult is able to subdue both kids even though they have a dog and two guns while he has nothing except the old hiding within a trough of water trick while holding his breath for 5 minutes and then surprise - jumping out to capture someone pointing a gun at him.
(3.) Marginal script and acting in which the two kids and a girl who show the characteristics of highly trained military end up dying while the adult male who never displayed resourcefulness or courage but cowardice and stupidity does survive. Huh! It's apparent that these writers and producers need to get out of the studio and city and acquire the life experience needed to make real suspense and action films.",1238457600,3,1358,4.502024291497976
