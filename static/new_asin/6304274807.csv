I would recommend it for the storyline, but do not expect it to follow the book at all (aside from main characters). My students greatly enjoyed it though.",1196380800,3,258,4.630434782608695
830671,5,6304274807,"I had never heard of this movie and didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.  The young lead actress is talented.  She's sassy and has a strong mind.  Beau Bridges was good as the slave owner who only wants to outdo his brother. This movie has all the twists and turns of slavery movies, but instead of despair at the end, one is left with a sense of pride as this little girl is sold, but she carries on.

830673,5,6304274807,"I stumbled across this movie plumbing Amazon as I do for AA movies.  This movie will DEFINITELY be going onto my christmas list!  I won't rehash the plot, but let me add a few things.  This movie is full of layers that might go unnoticed, especially to younger audiences, but they are powerful nontheless.  It is rare to see a movie about antebellum south that shows characters with so many dimensions.  For instance:

1.  It is rare to see a movie address the much earlier abolition of the slave trade in England.  One of the Master's guests make a point of leaving the table, unwilling to participate in the fruits of slavery, presumably not feeling charitable to those uncivilized enough to do so.

2.  As the plantation is on the brink of bankruptcy, we see the master is as odious to his own family as he is to his slaves.  He demands that his son work alongside the slaves, and is later surprised when his oldest son essentially removes him from handling his own affairs, in much the dismissive way he has always treated his family.

3.  The black slave driver is shown to be on the fringes of society, as an unwelcome interloper, never in, never out, and always able to lose that status at the drop of a dime.

4.  The prevalence of guns, pointed by both white and black men at the slaves demonstrates more than anything else the fact that many southerners lived in fear of their slaves.  Often, these movies show caricatures of the races, but this movie shows how ambivalent and precarious positions of power could be.

5.  When he talks about his wife, John describes a woman who made a sacrifice of sale to protect her child.  It is a little known fact that many men in the south found themselves on the receiving end of violence at the hands of women that they ""owned"".  Since history is written by the victors, it is very rare to read about an all-powerful white male who got his behind kicked by a black woman with a shovel--but it happened--alot.

5.  Although there is a definite 'feel-good' component to the movie, Sarny actually survives by her wits more than luck, and as we see her in the last scene, she is leaving determined to make her own luck.

As an African American woman, I found this movie incredibly deep and relevant.  The final scene alone is worth the price of the movie.  Finally, slaves are shown in their roundness, capable not only of just trickery and sabatoge, but cunning, patience, and vision. I cannot express the correctness of the pro-literacy message, one I spout on a daily basis. I will recommend this to everyone I see--everyone deserves to see it!",1179187200,18,2595,4.540948275862069
830674,5,6304274807,"African-American auteur Charles Burnett is best known for neorealist dramas like _A Killer of Sheep_, but his first foray into television is widely regarded as his masterpiece.  The New Yorker's Terrence Rafferty proclaimed _Nightjohn_ the ""best American movie of 1996.""  I agree.

The plot concerns Sarny, a twelve-year-old slave girl who learns to read, and uses her knowledge to expose and undermine the plantation power structure.  Performances are excellent -- newcomer Allison Jones is especially good as Sarny -- and Burnett's direction is honest and forthright.  Although _Nightjohn_ has a strong pro-education message, it is conveyed with plenty of suspenseful drama and a bare minimum of preachiness.  Family filmmaking doesn't get better than this.

The _Nightjohn_ DVD, like the laserdisc edition before it, presents the film in its original full-frame ratio without supplements or bonuses.  The transfer and sound are adequate -- and given the price, that's about as much as anyone can reasonably expect.

Note to parents: For a film that features no profanity, no sex or nudity, and only a few instances of onscreen violence, the PG-13 rating on this DVD seems excessive.  _Nightjohn_ is not for young children, because it strongly suggests the horror and brutality of American slavery.  But I'd recommend this film for ages 9 and up, with parental supervision.  (Be prepared for a long, thoughtful discussion afterwards.)",1146960000,160,1436,5.390134529147982
830675,5,6304274807,"This is a beautiful story about the power of reading. The film gives a moving insight into the condition of slavery in general and those who tried to open the door to literacy in particular. It is wonderfully acted, directed, and written. I showed it to my 8th grade reading class and they were enthralled.

830676,5,6304274807,"I use the book with reluctant readers and writers (middle to high school)to get them to see that ""universal, free, public education"" was not always available to all and how valuable the abilities to read and write are.  Then we watch the film which is an excellent adaptation of the book.  Readers/viewers might also want to read Paulsen's sequel, Sarny.  Both are interesting turns for Paulsen, best known for his coming of age/wilderness novels, especially Hatchet.  Paulsen is one of the best contemporary writers of description...check out the opening page to his book, The Winter Room.",1032048000,18,590,5.114583333333333
830677,5,6304274807,"I love this movie, the first time I saw it was at a showing given by the Delta's, a African American female sorority at the International House in Philadelphia.  It was like history coming alive before my eyes, the lesson it taught on the value of education was unforgettable.
When the lights went up, we were engaged in a dialogue led by poet, Sonia Sanchez on the impact of what we viewed and how relevant it was to all educators and students today.
I could only keep asking how to purchase the video!! A few days later I visited my video rental store and their it was on the shelf...it was sold to me for $10!
I have since purchased over half a dozen [...] and given as gifts to lovers of American history.  I also present workshops on slavery, Civil War and Literature in many schools, that connect to my storytelling work, featuring the works of Paul Laurence Dunbar. I often recommend this video to the teachers to show in the middle to university level before I come to the classroom or assembly.

It is realistically powerful! Excellent acting by all! Beautiful visuals and a great storyline from the cabin to the big house.

831057,1,6304274807,"I did not like the movie because it did not follow the book what so ever.
In this movie there were a lot of things wrong that did not happen in the book. In the book the slaves were not able to go to church because they could not have hope. In the book Sarny did not take care of the masters boy but in the movie she did. The movie did not have any similar things happening. In the movie Night John got his index finger and thumb cut off but in the book he got his toes cut off. In the book it never said anything about the master not having kids but in the movie he had three boys. The master and his two older boys helped the slaves get the harvest in but that would never happen. The master said he would throw the slaves a party if they get the harvest in. That would never happen back then.

831207,4,6304274807,"The only well-known actor in it is Beau Bridges, who plays Clel Waller, the owner of Sarny and Nightjohn. Sarny is a young girl, born into slavery and raised by a foster mother after her natural mother was sold. Nightjohn is an adult slave who had run away, gone north, been free, learned to read and write, and then returned so he could teach slaves to read. This was not just forbidden, but extremely dangerous.

One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way Waller's two young sons are depicted. The older son especially is very conflicted about the conditions under which they live. Not just the lousy conditions for the slaves, but the way he and his brother and his mother and even his father are victims of the evil system too. In fact, in terms of spiritual strength and self-respect, the slaves did better than their masters.

This was a movie made for TV, and probably never would have been a commercial success if played in theaters. There's not enough blood and gore, not enough shock and awe. There's just the sensitive story of some good people trapped in a terrible situation.",1336694400,,1106,4.6091370558375635

831267,5,6304274807,"This 1996 made-for-TV movie was originally broadcast on the Disney channel to great acclaim. Directed by famed African American director Charles Burnett, this is a gripping drama set on a southern plantation in the 1830s.  Nightjohn, brilliantly played by Carl Lumbly, is a newly arrived slave on the plantation.  Just looking him makes the viewer know that he has a long and sad tale to tell.  He is strong and good looking with coal black skin and huge eyes and deep scars on his back from many whippings.  He also has a secret which makes him unique among the slaves because he knows how to read. Secretly, he  teaches this skill to young 12-year old Sarney, played by Alison Jones. Naturally there are complications.

The story has a large cast of characters with several interweaving stories.  The plantation owner, played by Beau Bridges, is in debt and in competition with his brother, his own son is questioning the father's decisions about treatment of the slaves and his wife is having an affair with the local doctor.  The individual slaves have their stories too.  There's the young man who is wooing a girl on another plantation.  There's the faithful slave played by Lorraine Troussant who brought Sarmey into the world and who has seen Sarmey's mother sold off.  There's the old slave man who had a finger cut off because he knew how to read.  But most of all, this is the story of slavery and the hardship it creates.

The film moves fast.  There is never a dull moment. It depicts the horrible institution of slavery including the work in the cotton fields in the heat of the day as well as the problems faced by the slave owners.  But most of all it tells the story of one small girl who dared to be more than her station in life expected of her and of the dire consequences of her actions.  I will never forget my feelings of horror at this awful institution of slavery.  This is a fine film.  See it if you can.",1308096000,,1931,4.531791907514451
831268,4,6304274807,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.
As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.
This DVD gave me more insight into how slaves learned to read and write. And how the knowledge learned was passed on to others.
Very heartwarming story. Some good acting by Allison Jones as Sarny.",1294531200,,450,4.782051282051282
831269,5,6304274807,"I think, not having read the book, which this is truly a wonderful production. I also understand that the book must be quite different so if you have read the book please expect some difference as it is quite normally the case that when you read a book - the following movie does not meet expectations. I make this comment based on a reviewer that doesn't not like the movie, but basing feeling on the book - which may be fair, or unfair.

So, to reiterate as a viewer with no expectations based on the movie  - brilliantly stunning and educational. My 8 year old watched this and also could feel lessons being unraveled. She liked the power of literacy and brought select sections to her class to share at school.

I would not just show this to young kids without viewing it and considering the kids, the ecology of such a decision would simply be wrong - but if you feel fit - a child can get a lot out of this movie. Well done !",1289606400,,931,4.248587570621469

I wish all young Americans, black, white, Hispanic, or Asian can see the reality of knowing how to read and write were for African-Americans back at that time.  Maybe they'd appreciate it more and not take for granted, what others in the past vied for and could lose their lives if they had it.",1274140800,3,331,4.409836065573771
831271,5,6304274807,"Nightjohn (Carl Lumbly--M.A.N.T.I.S.)gives up his hard won freedom to return to slavery for the sake of teaching letters to other slaves of the south. It costs him dearly, as it did in real tales of the ante-bellum south. A young slave girl, Sarny (Allison Jones), knows the value of education and learns her letters and numbers from John, a child, and her own hard struggles in self-teaching. It works but also eventually costs Sarny something, but she, like Nightjohn, has something no bad plantation owner can take away or sell. Letters!

I can't speak for the book by Gary Paulsen, or accuracy of adaptation, but this is a FANTASTIC DVD that if family friendly and should be shown to students to encourage them in their pursuit of knowledge to their highest potential. Older people, like me, can simple enjoy the heart-warming story.

There are a very few violent situations, treatment of slaves, that is primarily indicated and leading to, but not shown on screen. It has no bonuses, not even subtitles for the 'southern English' accents.

This film was created in connection to Disney and Hallmark so that almost guarantees a worthy 5-star production. It comes across as very realistic, quite believable, and a solid gold message not often found in southern plantation period films. It's all about freedom, education, and goodness in people.

A sixth star should be awarded for the VERY REASONABLE PRICE.",1267833600,,1410,4.987234042553191

My students only complaint was that it did not follow the book accurately. We never saw Nightjohn return and Sarny was not sold off in the book. It made for an interesting comparison/contrast writing assignment. Overall, it is a good young person film and gives an antiseptic picture of the antebellum south.",1265500800,,551,4.575757575757576

Not only the inhumane physical torture to break the body and will that is usually portrayed in ""slavery in America"" movies, but this movie focused on the attempt to keep the slave mentally crippled/enslaved ""total helplessness"". It was  a crime subject to extremely harsh punishment or even death, if caught learning to read or write. It shows the courage and strong will of one particular slave in his determination to pass on what he had learned to other slaves, against all odds and regardless of consequences.

The little girl was adorable and brave. I respected her strength. No foul language, illicit sex scenes. Good entertainment/education for the kids.

Yes, I would recommend it, especially as a middle school movie day reommendation. If places other than Virginia allow children to recommend movies for history class.

831299,5,6304274807,"This is an excellent film, very well done.  The acting and everything else about it puts you right in the middle of the story with them, as if it's happening NOW.  The movie evokes feelings of shame that white people could ever treat other human beings who are also children of God, in such disgraceful ways.  How ignorant we whites were!  This is a movie everyone should see, as it's an outstanding history lesson for all.  There are no English sub-titles, which disappointed me, but it is ""closed-captioned"", which I don't understand.  There is nothing to click on at the beginning to activate that feature.  Therefore, I missed some of the dialogue, which I could HEAR well enough, but I have difficulty UNDERSTANDING what is said if the speaker does not enunciate well.  I have ordered the book by the same name on which the movie is based, which should clear up that little problem for me.

Beau Bridges is totally convincing as the evil plantation owner who mistreats his slaves, who are so realistic in their roles I found myself yearning to put my arms around them for comfort!!  ""Nightjohn"" is a slave who sacrifices his freedom in order to remain on the plantation to teach a little 12-year old girl slave and others to read and write, which is punishable by death if caught.  The movie is full of action and under-the-surface emotion on the part of the slaves.  The spirit of it is so realistic that at the end, I had to jerk myself back to 2008 reality.

This film reminds us of the tremendous power of words.  That is why slave ""owners"" were so determined to refuse education to their slaves, to keep them in subjection, demanding obedience in every instance. As teacher Nightjohn explained to his fellow-slaves, ""Words are freedom.""

I would not recommend this movie for those under 12 yrs. old.  It is marked ""PG-13"" for some violence and cussing, but is a must-see for adults and teens.",1204761600,2,1902,4.649700598802395
