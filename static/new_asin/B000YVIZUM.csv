8316552,4,B000YVIZUM,First saw this at my doctor's office. I thought it was the perfect place for it: my doctor's office is full of screaming kids and folks blowing their noses etc.... Something relaxing and peaceful to distract me while waiting was most welcome instead of Noprah or other daytime TV dribble. I bought a used copy on Amazon for 50 cents or so and enjoy putting it on once in a while. It has mellow fish scenes and some new age dreamy type music.,1362441600,,441,4.325301204819277
