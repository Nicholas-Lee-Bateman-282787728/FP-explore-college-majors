7813278,4,6301559525,"I spent four years doing pm drive for Smooth Jazz in Philadelphia...I took thousands of call from listeners who love this music, so I can tell you from personal experience, that ANYONE who loves the GRP roster (Lee, Patti, George, etc.) will LOVE this video.  Pour your favorite, light the fire, crank up the surround sound and settle in for an hour...It's a wonderful diversion to have on when you have people over for a party, or when you are decorating the tree.  The only thing wrong with it is that it's not on DVD!!!  ARGH!  That's how I came to write this review, because I wanted to buy it on DVD...Ah well.  It's still a regular treat in my house every year.  Even my kids love it!",1007337600,,690,4.3515625
