4041832,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"Sean Bean is at his best as Sharpe. His relationship with his ""chosen"" men especially Harper is great to watch. The shows are full of romance and adventure and take place in Napoleon's time on Earth. Love all the episodes.",1322265600,6,222,4.575

4041866,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"Another BBC Series that I learned to love and got to know Sean Bean. I wish they would repeat these, but I can get my own copies and play whenever I want now. Wish the Second set was a bit less expensive. I will keep my eyes out for that set for the future.",1479772800,,257,3.7777777777777777
4041867,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"Years ago, I had recorded VHS versions of these episodes and the quality was AWFUL.  I used some of my gift money to get this - it was crazy cheap.  We enjoyed watching these first three episodes again after several years.",1469491200,,222,4.390243902439025

4041873,4,B002ZJZ4G4,"The Sharpe TV series is a solid, entertaining adaptation of about half the novels in Bernard Cornwell's series about the Napoleonic Wars. Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley are so perfect as Sharpe and his Sgt Harper that when you go back to the books, those actors and their voices take over for the characters on the page. Excellent supporting cast, good production values, music, costumes and locations, exciting action and battle sequences. Cornwell was pleased enough that he dedicated one of his later Sharpe novels to Sean Bean.
Unfortunately, this cheap DVD set doesn't do the series justice. It's a decent, watchable transfer for sound and images, but not a great one. And there are NO features at all, not even subtitles to help us Americans understand the English accents. Worst of all, each disc plays a 3 1/2 minute trailer for the whole DVD series, EVERY time you start the disc, or even if you try to get to the menu from within the movie. Once the trailer starts, there's no way to fast forward, skip, or even stop playing until it ends. Really annoying.
If this is the only way you can watch the series, then get it anyway, because Sharpe is definitely worth it. Just be prepared for some annoyance before you can watch this terrific war story.",1441843200,16,1256,4.6877828054298645

4041876,5,B002ZJZ4G4,Can't say enough about this very fine historical drama. It's a new look at a real tough time in history; one we don't see enough of. Top marks all around. Even the bad guys do a good job ... sammy,1427068800,,196,3.925

4041878,5,B002ZJZ4G4,My buddy got us hooked on the series.  He could not find the rest.  But they are right here.  The wife loves this series and you will too.  I've loaned the rest of the series to my buddy.,1410912000,,187,3.8421052631578947
4041879,3,B002ZJZ4G4,"We enjoyed watching these, but they did seem a little dated as far as the production goes. The series got better as it went along. Sean Bean is always entertaining. Love his accent!",1410393600,,181,4.515151515151516

4041903,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"My wife is enjoying it, even, and she hasn't read the books. Does clearly depart from the books' story lines in places, and Patrick is not nearly as large as the books would lead you to believe, but his personality isn't inconsistent. Bean makes a plausible Sharpe. As another reviewer commented, it would have been nice if they could have gotten subtitles into the videos--especially for us old geezers who have some difficulty deciphering non-American accents.",1402358400,3,462,5.092105263157895
4041904,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"If I had the money, I would buy the entire series in  a heart beat. I've loved the entire series since I first saw it back in the early 90's. One of the movie listed Sharpe's rifles as from the 70's, but they're not that old. I love anything set in the Regency era. I'm not sure if Sharpe or Darcy is to blame for that. Of all the historical movies I've watched, Regency is my favorite time period. I just keep coming back time and time again. While Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy is the favorite of most ladies, Richard Sharpe is handsome enough for the ladies while adventurous enough for the guys. My Dad and I both enjoyed watching the series. There was enough action, danger, and excitement for him, while enough romance to make me swoon. I may never read the books but I thoroughly enjoyed romping through the Napoleonic war with Sharpe, Harper, and the gang. The music is wonderful, the Actor who plays Hagman sings a different stanza to the 'O'r the Hills' in every movie. The theme song is wonderful and sad at the same time but I never tire of hearing it. Please give All the movies a chance. It's well worth watching.",1396137600,5,1121,4.363636363636363
4041905,4,B002ZJZ4G4,"I've seen all the Sharpe films and have enjoyed them. I'm dinging these collections one star because there are no extras of any kind. No cast interviews, no documentaries, no production stills, zilch. I'm also disappointed in the quality of the film prints. They colors seem washed out to me. On DVD they should be...sharp.",1388016000,11,323,4.890909090909091
4041906,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"I have all 14 episodes and the Legend and Challenge, Peril, and absolutely love the series. Even though there are some historical inaccuracies who care its for entertainment and its close enough for me.  Sharpe is a fictional character so there will be inaccuracies.
I spent 7 years in England where I first saw the series its but together very well with actors of exceptional talent.",1385683200,3,384,4.818181818181818
4041907,5,B002ZJZ4G4,I am in the process of reading the last of the Sharpe books and I am bothered by the fact that it must sometime end.  I wish it could go on forfever.,1385424000,,149,3.65625

4041909,2,B002ZJZ4G4,"Since  I've spent much of my leisure time lately reading (and loving) Bernard Cornwell books, exclusively in the Richard Sharpe series the last few weeks, getting the TV Sharpe's series seemed like a no-brainer. After receiving the first (and for me, last) 3-disc set, I can see how ""no-brainer"" would apply in an entirely different way.
I grasp that you can stage an epic battle on the page much cheaper than you can on a TV series, so I was willing to forgive Sharpe's rescue of Wellington that was totally different from the book. That concession to the reality of a production budget can be forgiven, and you move Sharpe from sergeant to lieutenant less than five minutes in. But to portray Wellington as a softy when Cornwell went to such pains to show the real man is disappointing. Other characters were similarly developed. It would have been laughable if I wasn't so looking forward to how Sharpe played onscreen.
Exceptionally entertaining historical novels were turned into typical TV fare on the first DVD. I doubt I'll watch the other 2 discs in the set.",1374624000,9,1067,4.767567567567568

4041911,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"I've read the books for the second time and am watching the videos, actualy for the second time.  My original collection disapeared during our move to florida and I'm starting over again.  Due to an accident my short term memory and a few long term were screwed up and I'm literally watching and reading for the first time, as it were.
I sometimes miss the military, not the battles of course) it's unity and the friends that were made.  The DVD's bring it back. I remember sleeping in the open; searching thru congealed fat for pieces of bacon; and, contaminated water in a buffalo that laid waste to a battlion.  Of course I preferred any enemy to be no closer than 25 if wqere in the army.",1363996800,3,692,4.425196850393701
4041912,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"My wife and are avid Cornwell fans. We have both read all his Sharpe novels in the past. We were delighted to see some of his books had been made into a mini-series for British TV. We have now purchased all 5 of the Sharpe's Set series.

We have watched all 3 discs of this Set One. We enjoyed all the stories, but lament there are no subtitles. Also, there is a prelude to each and every story that cannot be fast forwarded. That is a bit irritating.

All in all we rate the 3 disks all 5 Stars.",1347840000,27,496,4.0

8385138,5,B002ZJZ4G4,"Great costumes, beautiful landscapes and scenery, decent adaptations of Bernard Cornwell's books, and glorious Sean Bean as Richard Sharpe and Daragh O'Malley as the grudgingly loyal Sergeant Patrick Harper. The supporting cast are good, and the series catches the flavor and grit of the Napoleonic wars. There are several notable actors in the series, like Brian Cox, Assumpta Serna, John Tam (who helped write the music), and others. Highly recommended.",1501632000,,455,5.514285714285714
