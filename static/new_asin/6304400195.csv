7869681,4,6304400195,"The show was pretty good. But some of the voice acting was pretty spotty... but since it was made in the late 80s i guess that's to be expected. The action was good but it got slow here and there. To me, it has similarities to Kamen Rider and Power Rangers but WAAAY more violent. If it were to get broadcast on tv again uncut, it would easily get a tvMA rating.",1494028800,,362,4.041666666666667

7869684,4,6304400195,"The DVD is pretty good.  This release has lots of features, including data files on the main characters and monsters, LOTS of trailers, the original Japanese intros and outros, and more.
It comes in Japanese and English, so its got stuff for both fans of Sub and Dub.  Though the subtitles seem fairly lacking at times.
And for those complaining about censorship/editing of the final episode, the original uncut episode is in the bonus features.
The box-set is great, with nice artwork and it collects the DVD cases of the individual volume releases.
Each of the 2 DVDs come with a cool Guyver fold-out poster as well.

As for the show itself, it's a mixed bag.
Lots of great action and bloody gore, so if that's you're thing, be happy.  If you're not into lots of blood and gore, then stay away.
It's got a decent storyline, and would be better if not for the fact that most of the characters in this show are annoying.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan, but these characters are annoying.
And to be quite honest, the voice acting in both English and Japanese is mediocre.  The only standout performance is Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop and lots of other animes).
All in all, it's still really entertaining.

Not perfect (5 stars), but better than average (3 stars), so it gets 4.

Enjoy.",1283644800,2,1281,4.563318777292577
7869685,1,6304400195,"Don't get me wrong folks, I love this OVA series to death. It's just that the Manga Entertainment release was horrible and insulting even to the source material.

We get a badly edited opening montage made up of clips from the show and the actual original theme footage, set to a new theme entitled ""Guyver Rock"" (a song by the way that sounds like it was an abandoned take for the ""Go Go Power Rangers theme"" with all the prolonged repitions of ""GUYYYYYYYYYYVEEEEEER!"").

You'd think this would change for the Japanese track. Instead, the original song plays alongside the Guyver Rock montage but ends before the montage does, giving you 5 seconds of silence before the episode begins.

In addition, Episode 6 of the Act 2 DVD is edited. BADLY edited I might add. As in they didn't bother trying to match the music up, it just jumps all over the place and there's no reason for it considering that there's a teen rating on it (one might think this is the after product of the attempt to get Guyver on TV).

All in all folks, this is not worth shelling the money out for. Manga lost the license to the OVA series last year so one can only hope that ADV who had a hand in doing the 2005 Guyver anime will snatch it up and release unedited DVDs.",1148428800,7,1243,4.391304347826087
7869686,5,6304400195,"Guyver is the grand daddy of japanime for me, it was my first watch and what got me hooked on japanime. i'd say it would be my second or maybe third favorite sci-fi stories (obviously star wars , bladerunner/ghost in the shell/predtor-alien etc... , are up there to but this among starwars and bladerunner are probably my most watched sci fi's, GO DUNE AND TRON!!! heh (god the elongated version of dune was LONG eh! even me a lover of the story was like wow tht was long any thts enough off topic banter PEACE",1127347200,,510,4.378947368421053
7869687,4,6304400195,"For all of us who have long awaited the release of this classic you might be wondering why not 5-stars-I actually would've rated it 4-1/2 but that option wasn't available. Anyway, the reason behind the rating is a minor technicality...the producers of this release decided to improve upon what was already a fantastic cartoon. The intro & outro's have been change from the original theme songs to something more reminiscent of the Spiderman cartoons,(bad move). In addition, the audio tends to be a little be a little flat, no doubt a result of digital reproduction, so while you can understand the characters a little better the end result is the characters sound like they have a cold. That aside, this is still one of the best anime series out there, and a must for any collector. I just recommend that if you're a parent purchasing for your child, this is true Japanimation not Pokemon. Violence is everywhere.:)",1107129600,10,916,4.840764331210191
7869688,5,6304400195,"Unlike much of the run-of-the-mill manga and anime that is shipped to the United States, The Guyver series has proven to be far and away one of the best.  If you appreciate Akira, Ghost in the Shell, or Princess Mononoke, you will love The Guyver series.  The art is fantastic and the story is straight forward enough to follow as well as complex enough to intrigue.  Unfortunately, The Guyver series has been overlooked in mainstream anime circles while mediocre series like The Bubblegum Crisis and Tank Wars have eaten up most of the press.  I would suggest, of course, starting with the first episode and working through the last, as they run as a story, much like The Macross or Loddoss Wars.  Also, very unfortunately, the 12th volume seems to be the last one out of Japan.  Finally, I have to give this series five stars and highly recommend it to fans of anime.",1003795200,2,869,4.6103896103896105
7869689,5,6304400195,"This is a great video!  In the video, Sho can't use the Guyver because he had to use the Guyver to kill his dad when his dad was turned into a monster.  Because of this, Sho hates the Guyver, and can't turn into the  Guyver.  What happened during the fight was this: Sho's dad turned into a  Zoanoid, called Enzyme 2, and attacked Sho.  Enzyme 2 destroyed Sho's  brain, (eww!) and the Guyver shifted into defense mode.  While in defense  mode, Sho had no control over the Guyver, and the Guyver killed Enzyme 2.  That is why Sho can't turn into the Guyver.  This is bad, because an extra  powerful Zoanoid named Aptom is going to try and kill Sho.  Aptom is  interesting because he has no Zoanoid body to call his own.  Instead, Aptom  can take on the forms of other Zoanoids.  Aptom can not only take on the  forms of other Zoanoids, he can enhance their abilities, as well.  Not only  that, Aptom can take the forms of different Zoanoids, and combine them into  a single body.  The only thing I don't like Aptom is his voice.  When Sho  or a Zoanoid transforms, their voices change slightly; their voices become  metallic and tinny.  Aptom's voice was already strange when he was in human  form, but the transformation altered his voice so much that at times it was  extremely difficult to understand what he was saying.  That is the only  thing I don't like about this video.",958435200,,1378,4.439516129032258
