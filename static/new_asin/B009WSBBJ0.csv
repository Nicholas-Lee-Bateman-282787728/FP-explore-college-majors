Mr. Handwerker did an excellent job with the editing making it easy to find what I was looking for and review the material. I highly recommend this dvd for the editing and the instruction given by GM Anderson, GM Kline and Sensi Miller.",1355184000,,392,4.383561643835616
8544736,5,B009WSBBJ0,"This is a Great compilation of what took place on that Saturday! These three gentlemen are experts in their fields!! As A 2nd Dan Black Belt in TKD, this training is so relevant in today's environment! I always considered myself very ""capable"" in a self-defense situation through my 10 years of TKD training. I'm glad I didn't rest on those beliefs. I have since realized I have so much to learn; things I thought I already had learned! This DVD, besides being a great compilation, demonstrates that no matter what MA you currently train in, or are thinking about training in, you can never stop learning from others! My advice, never isolate yourself in your training! I feel very fortunate to have this DVD so I can go back over things presented, but also to have actually spent that whole day training and meeting these incredible instructors!!!
Can't wait for the ""The Next 3"" Seminar/Training!!!",1353456000,,900,4.812903225806451
