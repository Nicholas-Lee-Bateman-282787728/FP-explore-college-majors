3658305,5,B000EVF07S,Enjoy Disney animation. Robin williams is the best - miss his energy & humor. Updated version is awesome.colors are vibrant. Picture great on 4k tv.,1446854400,2,148,4.96
3658306,1,B000EVF07S,Definitely a straight to DVD movie. Although it did take me back to the back to Straight to DVD days....,1445558400,2,104,4.25
3658307,1,B000EVF07S,"I was very disappointed in this DVD, the special features promised on this DVD, did not work, the viewing quality was poor, the DVD paused in several places, and froze up, so i could not enjoy the movie at all , it was not what i expected from a disney movie!!! would not buy this DVD if i were you, its a waste of money!!!",1252972800,,323,3.9846153846153847
3658308,3,B000EVF07S,The movie is super cheesy. It arrived in great quality though,1471564800,,61,4.636363636363637

3658310,1,B000EVF07S,I love the original but this one is terrible.,1469404800,,45,4.111111111111111
3658311,4,B000EVF07S,As it turns out 10K years in the cave of wonders wasn't in the cards.  Spoilers ahead... why aren't Aladdin and Jasmine married yet? That lost this movie one star.  However who would have thought that a bird could kill a djinn?  I guess the people at Disney did.  I will definitely watch this again.  (I have a kid),1469318400,,315,4.271186440677966
3658312,5,B000EVF07S,Loved this movie since I was a kid.,1468195200,,35,3.5
3658313,5,B000EVF07S,"My kids, my husband and I all love the Aladdin series. I do wish genie in this movie was Robin Williams' voice, but regardless, it is a great movie and my kids are glued anytime we put it on. Now that we have it on our Amazon videos, they can watch it anytime.",1467417600,,260,3.9245283018867925
3658314,5,B000EVF07S,"Is this more fun than the original Alladin movie? I don't know, maybe.

The gang is all here, Jafar is back, and more evil than ever. He's got plots and schemes and our intrepid heroes manage to save the day. Iago is really fun in this film. Robin Williams didn't voice the genie in this one, but Dan Castallaneta does a pretty good version.

For a straight to video movie, this one was really really fun as a kid. I don't know how many times we watched this.",1466812800,,459,4.204545454545454
3658315,5,B000EVF07S,I was so excited to add this to our movie collection! The film is high quality and plays perfectly. I'm so glad Amazon offers these films! I can't wait to get the 3rd Aladdin.,1466726400,,175,4.176470588235294

3658317,5,B000EVF07S,Saw it as a kid and watched the vhs as a kid.  Lots of complaints on here are from adults.  Great Disney movie for kids don't care about who plays the genie or that whatever complaints other people had.,1465603200,,202,4.153846153846154
3658318,3,B000EVF07S,This is the one without the sparkle that Robin Willaims added to the first movie.,1464912000,,81,4.466666666666667

3658330,4,B000EVF07S,"Ah The Return of Jafar. Growing up watching Disney movies, I didn't care about sequels and prequels and all the extra that came with a fictional or nonfictional lore of media. I just watched to enjoy and occupy my curious child mind. When I was younger, I enjoyed every second of the Aladdin sequel. Today, I still enjoy it just as much as I did, the catchy tune, the proper voice actors. With that being said, the art direction and animation didn't age well at all. I never noticed but it looks terrible. Overall I enjoyed myself again and it was a great look back at my younger years. Thanks Aladdin.",1455840000,,602,4.4324324324324325

8313039,2,B000EVF07S,"Aladdin, the original movie, was very good. This one, not so much. The animation was sub par if not really bad in parts. Usually, Disney movies are a pretty good bet for young kids, and I can enjoy watching them, but this one just isn't up to their standards.",1494288000,,259,4.3061224489795915

8313041,4,B000EVF07S,"As an 80s baby, I had found memories of this growing up.  After my daughter started liking Aladdin I got her this.  She loves it.  But with the Genie not Robin Williams and the lower budget drawing it was less of a quality movie as I remember.

But the stories was still good, and my daughter loves it.  It also breaks up the same songs she wants to hear from Aladdin.  So that was a plus.",1485475200,,389,4.052631578947368
