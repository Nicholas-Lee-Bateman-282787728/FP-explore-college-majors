2783480,4,B000NVIGD4,"MILL CREEK's super-sized movie packs are always a bargain, and a great way to add some depth to a video library. Their boxed DVDs are individually housed in durable gloss-coated heavy paper sleeves that take up a minimum of space, yet provide excellent protection for the discs. This compactness of design makes possible the storage of literally thousands of movies on a single book shelf.

The HORROR 250 MOVIE PACK is the largest collection of public domain fright films currently available. All these titles were previously released by MILL CREEK. The following lists their box sets duplicated in total, or for the most part (some working links included):

2783481,5,B000NVIGD4,"Horror Collection - 250 Movies (2007)

Run Time : 313 Hours 6 Minutes
  On 60 Double Sided DVD's

 This is a great collection based on quantity of mostly old movies you might of seen on TV long ago. Son of Svengoolie or Mystery Sciense Theater comes to mind. Many are black and white. Picture quality is poor on some of the movies along with the sound. These movies are probably geared toward people born in the 70's or earlier. Younger folks will probably hate this collection.
My favorites are ""The Terror"" and ""The Last Man on Earth"" which is an early version of ""Omega Man"". I have not gone through the entire collection yet.

Synopsis: The Horror 250 Movie Pack gathers an amazing collection of classic and contemporary chillers including Nosferatu, Phantom of the Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Little Shop of Horrors, House on Haunted Hill, Bad Taste, Mama Dracula and Night Train to Terror. Stars found in this amazing collection include Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Barbara Steele, Keenan Wynn, David Janssen, Louise Fletcher and many more. Never before have so many movies been offered in one amazing collection and packaged in a stunning foil collectors box.

2783482,4,B000NVIGD4,"I guess I am lucky, I already have the Sci-Fi, Horror and Chilling Classics 50 movie packs from Mill Creek, and this set has very little duplication.  Probably only 6 or 7 movies.  So, if you either have none of the other Mill Creek sets or only have some of those, this is a great set to buy.  Just don't expect great video and audio quality.  Still, these are a great way to collect lots of campy horror flicks very cheap.",1187827200,17,424,4.197530864197531
2783483,2,B000NVIGD4,"Mill Creek has clearly just repackaged movies that they are already selling, in the hope that people will buy them again. Surely it would've been possible to find new movies? If not, why bother with this new package?

Anyway, if you have none of the previous 50-packs, this would be a good place to start. I have the Sci-Fi, Horror, and Tales of Terror packs, so there is relatively little here for me (maybe a couple dozen movies). I can't swear whether the ones I don't have show up anywhere else, though I do know that ""Invasion of the Bee Girls"" is in the Drive-In Classics box, so it seems possible that all the movies here are duplicated elsewhere. (In the Chilling Classics box, for example.) Which, again, brings up the question of why bother with this. Supposing that you do enjoy the movies here, you'll probably want to go on and buy some of those other boxes... only to be confronted with many duplicated films, once again.

Maybe someone can explain the logic here, but I can't. I'm a big fan of these box sets, and have no quibble with the variable quality of sound, picture or movie. I always say, you get what you pay for--those with these sets, you often get MUCH MORE than you pay for. In this case, though, I can't recommend this box.

Can anyone say whether there are any movies here which are unavailable in the other Mill Creek bx sets? Thanks.",1177718400,43,1366,4.477911646586345

2783501,3,B000NVIGD4,"This is a fair collection of movies. I think the previous critiques more than adequately cover the strong points. So far I have watched over 211 titles; so I think I can comment accurately about weaknesses.

I am an avid fan of horror movies, so I was looking for some obscure titles - including foreign stuff  - from the 60's and 70's. I don't know who decided which films to include, but I was frustrated and disappointed to find a lot of poor quality crime dramas. Gangster films. Even very poorly written anti-drug propaganda.  I have no idea what these have to do with horror. If you deleted all of the titles that do not fit the genre, you'd have no where near 250 titles. I suspect you'd have less than 200. Perhaps less. Having seen so many great horror films over the years, I wondered why there were not more actual horror titles like Gorgo and Doctor Blood's Coffin to list only two.  Perhaps they are not in the public domain? Maybe those compiling this collection had no clue? If you're looking for the really cheesy, entertaining horror/monster films from your youth, this isn't the collection you want.

The visual and audio quality are sometimes dreadful. I found myself turning the volume way up to catch dialog. (Of course, the louder the sound, the more distorted it became). If you have any hearing problems, you may want to skip this one.

Was this a good value for the money? Ummmmm... yes and no. Yes because there are a few very worthy titles. No because the quality of the films sometimes makes them a chore to watch. That feels more like work than fun. Now you know. It's up to you to decide if it's worth the money.",1222300800,8,1642,4.493288590604027
2783502,5,B000NVIGD4,"Update - OMG!!! I just noticed that they increased the price from $49.99 to $89.99. That means now you'd be paying 36 per movie. Boy am I glad I got it when I did.

Wow! What a collection! This movie set contains 250 movies for a mere 20 each. There are some real classics here including my favorites, Metropolis (a great robot movie) and Nosferatu. I had previously purchased these two movies individually for 3.99 each. The fact that they are included in this set only makes me wish I had purchased this set a lot sooner. The movies included span several decades from the 1920's through the 1980's. Needless to say, many are in black and white. Some movies are in color but the color may look washed out or faded. These are after all, old movies. Don't expect HD quality. Though the box is titled ""Horror Collection"", I would say many of the movies would be more accurately classified as sci-fi. I haven't watched all of the movies yet. I figure if I set aside one night per week as movie night, it would take me 4.8 years and 47 pounds of popcorn to finish watching all of them. Looking forward to it.

Look in the Comments to this review for an updated list of the movies I've watched from this set and my impressions of each.

I've noticed that Mill Creek no longer lists this set in their catalog on their website. I wonder if this means they've discontinued it. If you're thinking of getting it, you may want to get it while you still can.

By the way, I have to give Mill Creek an A+++ for customer service. I had a problem with one of the discs in my set but Mill Creek remedied the problem quickly and efficiently so I didn't have to return the whole set. Thanks.",1220745600,7,1673,4.318471337579618

Apart from the value of that compilation and de more tan reasonable price, the bad news are the low picture quality of the feature films. Not only most of them are simply transcriptions of VHS tapes, but the compression rate is very poor, so they look even with less quality.",1215388800,3,527,4.617021276595745
2783515,5,B000NVIGD4,"The Mill Creek Horror Collection 250 Movie Pack gives you a ridiculous amount of value for the money. At around 20 cents a title, how can you go wrong?
 I've had this for a couple of months and have managed to watch about 20 of the movies so far. I can't comment on everything, but I figure what I've seen so far is a good snapshot of the whole collection.
 I'm giving this five stars because it's so much for so little, but I do have a few things to critique.
 First of all, image and sound quality tend to range from poor to mediocre. All of the movies I've seen so far are watchable, but in many cases a poor quality print of the film was used and in some cases, the transfers look like they were made from VHS tapes that had been played a few too many times. If you're a fanatic for razor-sharp images and crystal clear sound, you're not going to find it here. You'll need to let go of that to enjoy this collection. To make an analogy, think of major studio releases made from the best available film prints as being like hard-cover books. This, on the other hand, is like a box full of dog-eared paperbacks.
 As for the movies themselves, I think the title ""Horror Collection"" very loosely applies. There are actually a number of genres in this package, most of which seem to fall into the horror, sci-fi, and fantasy categories. So far I've seen a couple of movies that would be more accurately described as film noir or docudrama. I think it's safe to say the entertainment value varies widely. Some of the films are quite good. There are even a few classics scattered throughout the collection. Many are duds, and some are just plain strange!
 A large number of the films are of foreign origin (badly dubbed English can be entertaining all by itself) and the years of release run from the silent era to the 1990s. Some of the best titles are from the silent era.
 One very important note is that the age appropriate audience for these films is all over the map. Some of them are suitable for, and even aimed at children. Some are strictly for adults. The film ratings are listed on the individual disc sleeves. Be sure to pay attention to the ratings and maybe pre-screen unrated titles if there are children around who might watch them.
 The packaging is simple and very well done (see customer images for a better look). There is a sturdy outer box with all of the titles listed on the back. There's an inner flip-top box which contains all of the discs in their own separate sleeves with brief descriptions of the titles including the ratings or lack thereof and years of release. The discs are double sided and there's an average of four titles per disc. You'll have an instant library that takes up very little shelf space.
 If you are a fan of the low budget and the obscure, you'll find a lot to like here, and you'll find it at a price that won't break the bank!",1214438400,18,2879,4.378277153558052
2783516,4,B000NVIGD4,"I decided to buy this set for my kids, they're pre-teens and they're getting out for summer vacation pretty soon, and I wanted them to have a variety of movies to watch. The set is pretty good, we've watched several of them over the weekend, some can be a little cheesy but my kids got a kick out of that. I do have to say some do have some nudity so I had to be careful about which ones I put on, they mainly wanted to watch the sci-fi ones and those were good for them. All in all they're good for the price, some of the very very old ones the audio and visual quality wasn't great, but what can we expect from movies that were made 70 yrs ago, right? They saw a few of the silent ones and they didn't seem to mind that, I was real surprised to see they knew exactly what was going on without the voices.

The only downside from this buy is that (living in Denmark, Europe), the danish taxes was higher then the actually cost for the box... hmm, but that seems to be my own fault.

In any case I thought I'd share some info I learned through painstaking research done via the Mill Creek website. If you want the most amount of movies for the least amount of money then by all means GET THIS SET! If you already own other Mill Creek sets then expect to see lots of duplicate titles if you decide to get this one. That said, here's a few tidbits of interesting facts for my fellow Amazon consumers.

I discovered that the Horror Classics 100 Movie Pack includes many movies that are NOT in this set. Not to worry though...every single one of these missing titles can be found in the Drive-In Movie Classics 50 Pack! Also for my fellow horror fans I recommend the Chilling Classics 50 Pack, of which a whopping 41 horror movies are NOT in this set.

In conclusion, for the most amount of horror/sci-fi movies for the least amount of money spent and very little duplication, my recommended purchases are:

Horror 250 Pack
Drive-In Movie Classics 50 Pack
Chilling Classics 50 Pack

That gives you only 50 horror films, but it is the A-list of B horror films. There is no duplication between the 50 Movie Horror Pack and this 100 Movie Pack of horror films, although there is some duplication between this pack and the Chilling Classics, Tales of Terror and Nightmare Worlds packs. In fact, most of the best films in this pack are in the Tales of Terror pack.

Primarily, though, Mill Creek found these hundred films by going more to the 60's, 70's, and 80's, rather than the 30's through the 50's, and the quality of the content suffers for it. Especially by the 1970's, most B horror films are far inferior in quality to those made up to the 1950's. This is also the decade when horror films began to exchange graphic violence for atmosphere and campiness, and that simply doesn't appeal to an old movie fan like myself. The breakdown of films by decade is:

1920's - 1
1930's - 18
1940's - 11
1950's - 19
1960's - 20
1970's - 22
1980's - 9

The highlights of the package are the following:
The Amazing Transparent Man (1960) - combines safe-cracking and an invisibility formula with a criminal main character who seems to think he is John Wayne.
The Bat (1926) - a silent horror film that has a character dressed like Batman trying to scare away inhabitants of an old house so he can have the 200K hidden there to himself.
House of Mystery (1934) - a man kills a monkey in India and a curse follows him home twenty years later. Another of the ""old dark house"" thrillers plus there's a man in a monkey suit that is not particularly scary.
Eegah (1962) and another Arch Hall Jr. movie - Anything with Arch Hall was always fun to me. He'll always be the king of camp.
The Wasp Woman (1960) - 40 year old cosmetic queen longs to be 22 again. A cosmetic potion does the trick, but she literally becomes Queen Bee.
Strangers of the Evening (1932) - Eugene Pallette & Zasu Pitts in a mystery involving bodies disappearing from the city morgue.
Shock (1946) - Vincent Price is caught in the act of killing his wife and must do away with the only witness, who is in shock.
Midnight Warning (1932) - A man seems to disappear in thin air in front of several witnesses. A detective must determine what really happened. Good precode mystery.
One Frightened Night (1935) - A wealthy old man decides to divide his estate among a group of people UNLESS his long lost granddaughter returns. Of course she does just that. Mix that with a night of creepy events in the old man's mansion with the heirs all there as guests, and you have a good old-fashioned thriller.
The Ghost Walks (1934) - Everyone staying in an old dark house who says that they see ghosts winds up dead. This mystery must be solved!

Inside of box is like a picture frame with thicker sides so that you can stand the disks up and flip thru them without removing from box.  Important?  Yes, I have many of these bigger sets that that was just a slip cover and a flimsy drawer holding the disk. Disks have paper sleeves, no protection, but this set is so nicely made.

Quality of the films is good, there are some that have little flakes on them, mostly 1930s movies, but that makes me think old timey anyway.  Not sure of process used to transfer or anything on these.  The disks are double sided with a thick cardboard sleeve printed with contents.
