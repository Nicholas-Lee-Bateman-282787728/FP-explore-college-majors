8201517,4,B000IZJQRK,"Even though I had read the synopsis I was not prepared for the astounding sex scenes. No nudity and yet sizzling enough to make you squirm in your seat. Not your standard Bollywood fare. Despite a quite beautiful song, lip-synced by Ms. Rekha in a ""Home Alone"" scene with the rain pouring down outside. The storyline is somewhat uneven. The (Happy???) Ending appeals to one's imagination. But it is more than the almost expected ""Money does not equal Happiness"" statement. It touches among others on the sexual imbalance which often sneaks into a couple's life. Ms. Rekha carries the film and makes one forgive and forget the less convincing parts of its story. Om Puri (husband) is best when he acts the wise mentor to his students. In the intimate scenes he appears wooden. Daisy Irani is a very believable female pimp Reena. I do not know what this film looked like in the theatres but I lament its transfer to DVD. The colours change from scene to scene. And the editing often is clumsy. But ... Ms. Rekha shines.",1175126400,6,1017,4.655555555555556
