4513976,5,B0050DON82,"This film set in Italy towards the end of WWII features the relationship between a local ""concentration camp"" for Jewish children and a nearby convent dedicated to freeing inmates by devious means and smuggling them away out of the neighbourhood.

The transition from an Italy under Mussolini, closely allied to the Nazi regime, to one rebelling against the tyranny of Nazism by the populace, is crucial to an understanding of the story.

At the commencement of the film the camp is in full control from the Italian military under the command of Major Spoletti (Ronald Lewis) who has a lenient approach to the goings on there. This all changes with the importation of Nazi Colonel Horsten (Albert Lieven), a cruel, complex character hell bent on carrying out his duties to the letter, ably abetted by his Nazi right-hand man Lt. Schmidt (Peter Arne).

In the camp hierarchy Major Spoletti falls between the two Germans providing an irritant to both and in particular the Colonel himself.

The Covent is resolutely led by Mother Katharine (Lilli Palmer) with her faithful band of followers, save one who fears both for the safety of her fellow sisters and to some degree at odds with her faith. Despite the increase security at the camp the nuns continue their mission of mercy with increasing tension from the Colonel's surveillance that puts in peril sympathisers for the nun's cause well outside the convent itself.

The film should challenge our understanding of conflict no more relevant than in today's world of racial intolerance and growing demonstrations of anti-Semitism in Europe.

An outstandingly scripted, directed and acted masterpiece, at times almost too tragic to bear.

You were once a child,
remember that, and
before that--?

And now you are a man
and in possession of a loaded gun
with which you kill men, women and children--
and for what--in the name of some ideology,
or simply to kill for killing's sake?

Remember, you were once a child
as defenceless as those you slaughter with the gun,
but understand this, death is the ultimate reality
we all have to face, with the total
of our earthly conduct at our backs.",1422576000,,2138,4.916666666666667

4513978,5,B0050DON82,"I can't call this a great piece of cinema.  It's just a treasure I remembered from long ago, remembered loving it, and was so glad to find it available on DVD.  The story is simple enough.  A group of nuns assist the rescue of Jewish children from a concentration camp during the Second World War.  I may be overly sentimental, but a story like this will always get my attention, and being able to see it again was a great treat.  I shall enjoy watching it again and again.",1389916800,5,473,4.269662921348314

8451079,5,B0050DON82,"I purchased this film on the recommendation of my mother,And I wasn't disappointed. It is set in fascist Italy during the German occupation in WW2,and deals with a group of nuns who are smuggling out Jewish children sent to a death camp under the noses of the local Italian constabulary. To say they are somewhat lax at their job is an understatement. Enter Peter Arne as the newGerman commander and you have an explosive situation. He then clashes with the head nun ( Lilli Palmer) in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. Well worth a look.",1520899200,,539,4.56701030927835
