5020357,4,B006UV9LAS,"Overall, every aspect of Captive Factory Girls exists as little more then scaffolding to support its many scenes of tittilation. Like many other Japanese films of its kind, it is stripped down to the bare essentials of what is needed to make a motion picture, including using as few set pieces as humanly possible. Outside of a few exterior shots, the set designs consist of, a stairwell, an elevator, a warehouse, a metal shop, a cafeteria, the ladies dorm room, a changing area and bathroom, a hallway and office, a jail cell, and a guards living room. On top of this, all these set pieces are simularly void as humanly possible. Most of them consist of blank white walls, bland white tile floors, and plain white lowered ceilings with inset florescent light fixtures. Another dead give away of the studio warehouse filming location, is that many of these rooms are only seen from one angle, despite how many times they may appear in the film. The guards living room is nothing more then a brick wall, a stereo and a dark vinyl sofa. The womens dorm room consists of only three beds and two barred up and covered over windows. With a taunt length of only 76 minutes, the film bolsters eight seperate scenes of lewd debauchery. There are two moments of groping, a lady on lady sex scene, a somewhat consensual man on woman sex scene, and three acts of rape. One can only imagine what this production would have in common with an American porn film. The production, obviosly only had a few dollars and a few days to get the job done, and thus, no time to full around ( No pun intended ). Unlike many recent low budget independent American films, the production of Captive Factory Girls where completely professional. Instead of fooling themselves into trying to make a different kind of film then the material suggested, they where instead focused and direct. They had a clear understanding of the basic use of plot, acting, dialog, and pacing, and as a result, made a film that it concise and streamline in both its approach and exicution. The downside to this type of film making however, is that the film looks and feels exactly like what it is...Cheap!

The lead role of Natsumi is played by Ai Takeuchi, a most appealing young specimen with a simply yummy set of assets. The film starts as she willingly submits herself to a year term of slave labor in a sleazy underground metal factory. She did this as a risky attempt to find out what happened to her reporter boyfriend who had been investigating the syndicate and is now missing. The mob run metal shop is in the unwholesome business of making illegal black market hand guns, as well as sexually assaulting its nubile female inmates. It houses workers that are either in debt to the mob, or simply on the run from the law. The slave labor itself, is shown as a montage featuring Ai Takeuchi using various different presses, drills, and saws, and carrying sparsely filled cardboard boxes around while acting like they are heavy. Dressed in her inmate issued white wife beater, she is soon coated in glistening sweat and displaying the appropriate smudges of grime on her chin cheek and shoulder, signifying that the labor is indeed hard. After the montage and a bit of chit chat, comes the first rape scene, which like all the other rape scenes, takes place upon the guards vinyl sofa. Not at all brutal or realistic, these rape scenes are pure misogynistic male libido pleasing irresponsible film making, with plenty of breast groping and pleading involved. Much the same way that Bill Bixby would always turn into The Incredible Hulk exactly two times an episode, the sex scenes in Captured Factory Girls are so stratigically placed, that a person can set their watch by them. There is also a striking difference in the way that Japanese cinema accepts rape as if its nothing out of the norm. This is evident in how the victims in this film never seem to lose a sence of innocence or dignity after being molested. After Natsumi is raped by the male guard on the dreaded vinyl sofa, she has one brief moment of depression, before she actively begins snooping around for her missing boyfriend. She then fallows this up by having a heated lesbian frolicking with the main female guard, all so she could steal a copy of the factory jail cell key. Not at all the type of activities one would expect a rape victim to engage herself in immediately after the violation. The odd thing is, that despite the sinister debased nature of this feature, it somehow feels rather airy, and dare I say, Clean. Much like the set pieces, the sex in this film feels rather antiseptic, and defys the very nature of this drama.

Overall, this is a pretty decent Japanese Pink Film that manages to do many things well, but nothing spectacularly. As an exploitation film, I rank Captive Factory Girls as a 3.5, I am giving it an extra half star props simply because of the low budget and obviously quick in the can film job of this feature. It isn't reinventing the wheel by any means, but I can't help but admire the concise precision of the production. My beef with the film is that everything about it feels atmospherically artificial, right down to its formulated plot. Captive Factory Girls does what it sets out to do, and what you would expect it to do, but it could of been a whole lot better had it just applied some grit and seediness to its blank atmosphere. In short, this film could of used a fat dose of 70's sleaze to remove some of its clinical feel.",1258934400,55,5500,4.616956077630235
5020358,5,B006UV9LAS,"Captive Factory Girls The Violation, is a movie about various beautifull young Japanese women who, through various situations, have incurred a large debit to the Japanse mob.  To pay-off this date they work a machinests in Factory.  Each day they work, a part of their debit is erased.  Each day they misbehave (as in try to escape or accidentaly break something) their debit is increased.

The movie starts when a young woman is being introduced to her new life in the factory.  She is secretly looking for her boyfriend who disapeared while working undercover on a newpaper article about the factory.  There is apparently an urban legend in Japan about these kind of factories.  The women machinests work on a different floor from the men machinests because they factory personell don't want the women to know what they are making (they are making blackmarket guns).  The real abuse and degradation, from the other women, start when she trys to talk to some men in the lunch room

Now that I've touched on the plot, let me inform you about my thoughts on this movie.  I LOVED IT!!  If you like your exploitation movies with a semi-believable plot then then is the movie for you.  If you think women with dark hair & fair skin, and without any tattoes or pierceings, are the most beautifull women on the planet then this is the movie for you.  My favorite seen in the movie is when the new girl is in the shower room with the female ""guidance councilor"".  Plenty of T&A.

In short, this movie is like a women in prison movie, only the women actualy have jobs to do when they aren't trying to escape.",1245628800,77,1600,4.584507042253521

Evil prison guards and a very hot ""warden"" ensue. Think 80`s American WIP movies with better acting. This is definately a B-movie ,but you should find what your looking for. The sex scenes are actually pretty good although a bit violent. The real selling point for this dvd is the actresses. They are stunning. Especially if you prefer Asian women.

5020377,4,B006UV9LAS,"This flick is a prime example of the current crop of pink/exploitation films coming out of Japan these days - they`re extremely low-budget w/ a ridiculously simple premise, but they manage to deliver the goods more than adequately. It`s not the Art-House variety pink film like 'A Lonely Cow Weeps At Dawn', it`s more gutteral and gratifying, if you`re looking for true exploitation (tho I liked ' A Lonely Cow' immensely, being an Art House fan as well as a sleaze fan). They`re very similiar to the Asian WIP flicks from Switchblade Pictures ('Death Row Girls', 'Chain Gang Girls') , but I believe them to be a notch above in terms of flesh and fleshed-out storylines. I won`t bother to go into the plot seeing as how there are several other reviewers who have already plumbed that angle in the extreme, but I will state that the actresses are easy on the eyes, the nudity abundant, the exploitation plentiful, oh yeah, and there`s a happy ending. No, not that kind, the other kind...",1266278400,30,986,4.705202312138728

8504842,4,B006UV9LAS,"CAPTIVE FACTORY GIRLS: THE VIOLATION is another great title for a nondescript Japanese pinku (read: erotic) thriller made on a very tight budget. This one's a little better than most thanks to a more involved storyline than usual depicting the plight of young women forced to labour in a dim and grubby factory. It's very much a voyeuristic piece with the director focusing throughout on young woman wearing tight string tops and the like, and the story is reminiscent of a prison movie with scenes of animosity and violence between the workers. The male characters are sleazy beyond belief.",1523836800,,591,4.97979797979798

The movie being censored to the point that it's basically a light PG-13, and only that because of rape themes, is unacceptable and not expected. I have no idea how long this movie would have been but I'm guessing a good 1/4 of the movie was censored (not pixelated but flat-out cut and removed).

Really, an Asian sexploitation movie without any of the reasons fans watch it. I'll pass.

Oh, and are we really supposed to sympathize with this couple? Without giving the end away I'd nominate them both for Worst Friends Ever.",1513987200,2,575,4.683168316831683
