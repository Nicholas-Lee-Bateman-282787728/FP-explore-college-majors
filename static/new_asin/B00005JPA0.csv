1571733,5,B00005JPA0,"This is a great movie.  I saw it twice in the theatre and will buy it when it comes out on DVD.  I've also been recommending it to my friends. I'm not a movie-goer unless the movie is artistic or has qualities that would strike my interest.  ""Employee of the Month"" already had my interest by the title because I happen to work in the service industry and can relate to the movie.  The characters were all wonderful, including Jessica Simpson.  Please don't knock her.  Everyone has to start someplace and this is the right place for her to start.  She did a marvelous job.  This movie was so entertaining and I laughed all the way though it twice.  When the movie was over, I came out happy.  I don't like bloodshed or Freaky Friday movies, just everyday humor and fun.  I give this movie 5 stars for simplicity, humor, good actors doing a great job.  It might be a certain expression on a face or a certain camera shot or angle.  This movie had the right stuff.  Hopefully there will be more movies like this with more of the same actors and unknown actors who need a start in the movie industry.",1163203200,3,1098,4.344827586206897
1571734,3,B00005JPA0,"In the film business it's called counter-programming: Provide moviegoers - usually women - with an alternative to the weekend's big opener.

And so, on the opening weekend of Martin Scorsese's pointless, nihilistic gangster picture ""The Departed,"" in waltzes ""Employee of the Month,"" also pointless, but also amusing satire about supermarket cashiers. And judging by her wardrobe, Jessica Simpson's chest is the other key topic. The better to distract you from her acting, I guess.

Directed and co-written by Greg Coolidge, it's not on par with Jennifer Aniston's ""The Good Girl,"" but the movie does benefit from a likable newcomer in Dane Cook and a committed, funny turn by Dax Shepard, one alumni of ""Punk'd"" who at least knows where his bread is buttered.

Shepard plays Vince, the cashier at Super Club - a spoof of Sam's Club - with so fast a conveyor belt he's been called ""the fastest hands in the Southwest."" Vince is a professional sycophant who squirrels his way into the employee of the month award so many times, he's now eligible for the ""grande prize"" of a managerial promotion and a ""newish"" 2004 Chevy Malibu.

Slacker boxboy Zach (Cook) is the store clown who suddenly decides to compete for the award when a new cashier named Amy (Simpson) starts at Super Club and Vince fixes his gaze on her.

""Employee of the Month"" has its moments. The ""cashier's lounge"" is cleverly presented as a kind of airline pilot's den of leather furniture and free soft drinks. Vince ""rescues"" a lost child and emerges from a haze of cold air that bursts out of a freezer-food door. And weirdo Andy Dick gets a few off as a nearly-blind optometrist.

Cook has some of that Ryan Reynolds look and appeal: Relaxed, confident, slightly moronic. Shepherd and his ""assistant,"" played by Efren Ramirez are a good duo. The rest of the movie is copied, chapter and verse, from The Book of Sandler: Profane elderly women, a bullying dwarf, random shots at immigrants and gays, and, of course, the ""lesson"" of personal pride and self-discovery.

But let's get one thing straight: Jessica Simpson seems nice enough, even if she marches to Daddy's drum in her music career and personal life. Maybe Pops put her up to this, because you're not going to see a more uncomfortable performance this fall. It's not that Simpson can't act - she does not appear to know how. Her looks and reactions come off as inquisitions toward her director: ""Is this how I should be?""

Coolidge, possibly by necessity, keeps her out of much of the movie. But each time she's in it, she's wearing low-cut, look-at-these! shirts and dresses that undercut whatever goal Simpson might have had in creating a character. The singer has a steep enough hill to climb without being unwittingly objectified in every scene.",1161388800,3,2777,4.856236786469345
1571735,5,B00005JPA0,"This was a great comedy movie!! I don't know why u guys judge every comedy so dang hard though. And I'm not saying that the movie is the best because of Dane Cook or Jessica smokin hot Simpson, but it really was the realationships and the environments of all the characters personalities portrayed in the movie as thier characters, That made this movie so damn funny. ""THis is an 81 Honda, How dare YOu!!"" Just see this movie, you won't regret it UNLESS U HAVE NO COMEDY IN UR LIFE! lol",1160870400,5,486,4.351648351648351
1571736,3,B00005JPA0,"So now add EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH to the ongoing list of slacker movies. No, it's no CLERKS or OFFICE SPACE, but, nevertheless, I found it quite charming and certainly convivial enough to give it three stars. The acting efforts of stand-up comic Dane Cook and Groundlings alum and Cook's movie nemesis Dax Shepard propel the movie and give it its comedic gusto. The rest of the cast, including some so-called professional funnymen, vary from congenially effective to tepid.

Most of us can relate, at some point or another, to people suffering the woes and aggravations of wasting away in a dead end job. We've all felt that overriding sense of boredom and career unfulfillment. Imagine toiling away at a Costco-like superstore as the lowest of the low, the much lamented position of Box Boy. Dane Cook plays Zack Bradley, a likable, laid back box boy at the Super Club (""where buying in bulk is our God-given right"") who was quite content to let the glory go to cocky, super go-getter Vince Downey (Dax Shepard), the ""fastest cashier in the Southwest Region."" That is, until he falls for new cashier girl Amy Renfrew (Jessica Simpson). Her personal file indicates Amy will only date employees of the month. So Zack decides to be that employee of the month but then has to contend with chief rival Vince, who has held that position for 17 months running. And if Vince gets it for the 18th time, he'll break the Super Club record and will win the grand prize of a brand newish 2005 Chevy Malibu. Will Zack be able to summon some reserve of ambition and achieve this oh-so-lofty goal? Will Dax Shepard steal the movie away from Dane Cook? Will Jessica Simpson ever get past acting on a vapid level?

Every now and then, I feel like veering away from Oscar caliber type movies and getting down and dirty, cinema-wise (and, no, I don't mean those kinds of movies). I'm probably gonna go check out THE DEPARTED in the following weeks, but, tonight, I was in the mood for some crude, unPC shtick. I mean, what do you expect from this B-level cast and from Dane Cook? Rated PG Bill Cosby stylings? C'mon, now. This is pretty much the low-brow stuff that I thought the movie was gonna have, and I'm pretty content after having seen it. It contained enough chuckle-and-laugh-out-loud-worthy moments and enough shots of the nicely-endowed, scantily-clad Jessica Simpson that I didn't feel I wasted my money. Folks wandering into the theatre in search of Shakespearean styles of thespianism are in the wrong freakin' place. EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH is fully a frat movie, its core audience predominantly composed of juveniles and juveniles-at-heart. It does strive to be sweet at times and even attempts to drive home a message late in the flick (which I actually think proved to be more of a detriment to the film).

There are some things that the movie missed out on. Casting, for example. Amy Smart would've been perfect for this role (although, she's perfect in any role) and would've done so much more with Amy Renfrew than Jessica Simpson did here. The word is still out on whether Simpson can act, but there's no doubting that she looks fine. Come to think of it, Ryan Reynolds probably would've also improved on the Zach Bradley role. And I've never been an Andy Dick fan. Guy is too out there and, worst of all, is NOT funny. The film also suffers from not taking enough chances (you could sense Dane Cook biting his tongue in many of the scenes), and the ending was definitely too smaltzy. The humor is also not mined enough in Andy Dick's blind-as-a-bat character, who toils away in the eye-care department. Same goes for the character of Gary Ross, the domineering dwarf.

But, fear not, this comedy flick does offer some nice touches. I liked the idea of a secret hangout located on top of one of the towering, warehouse-like piles of store stock supplies, the concept of the store manager (named Glen Gary) being afraid of his big brother (named, Glen Ross, who turns out to be an imperious dwarf), and Efren Ramirez as Vince's sycophant lackey. Dane Cook, while not Ryan Reynolds, still is very serviceable in the lead role and you almost buy into his 180 degree redemption from a deadbeat to a responsible citizen. And Jessica Simpson does look VERY hot. And, with respect to the other actors, Dax Shepard is truly the one to watch in this film. The combination of arrogance and insecurity he instills within his role makes Vince Downey the most well-rounded character in the movie.

So, kudos to Dax Shepard, Dane Cook, Harland Williams, Efren Ramirez, and - fine! - kudos also to Jessica Simpson. Slackers of the World, unite. Go down some suds, scarf a steak sandwich, and get yourself to the nearest cinema and revel in the low-rent but funny experience that is EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.",1160352000,10,4789,4.710023866348449

1572189,5,B00005JPA0,"The Employee Of The Month movie stars Dane Cook as Super-Club employee Zack Bradley, Jessica Simpson as new employee Amy Renfro, and Dax Shepard as head cashier Vince Downey who takes his job a little to the extreme at times. For instance, the character is shown at times being less than cordial towards Super Club securityofficer Semi (Marcello Thedford). Downey is also extremely aggressive with even the one coworker Jorge Mecico (Efren Ramirez) who is an ally and supports him. Vince Downeys dominant nature at first catches the attention of Amy Renfro until he lets the rivalry between him and Zack Bradley color how he acts around Amy Renfro. Things come to an even more heated event when Vince Downey finds out that Zack Bradley is also vying for employee of the month. Bradley also happens to have the support of coworkers Russell Gunders (Harland Williams), Lon Neilson (Andy Dick), and Iqbal Raji (Brian George). The two managers of Super-Club Dirk Dittman (Sean Whalen) and Glen Garry (Tim Bagley) seem to actually unknowingly encourage the rivalry between Bradley and Downey. Meanwhile the Dittman character is also extremely sensitive and insecure when it comes to his brother Glen Ross (Danny Woodburn).

1572687,5,B00005JPA0,"This is a great movie with an amazing cast. Dane Cook, Jessica Simpson, Sax Shepard. They just work so well together to make a really funny great movie.

Dad Shepard plays the concieted errogant guy, he does whatever he can o sabotage anyone who gets in his way of becoming employee of the month.

Jessica Simpson plays the beautiful buxom blonde beauty queen every man wants to date, but what they find out is that she only likes to date the employee of the month.

Dane Cook plays the typical slacker at work, does just what he has to, to get through the day at work, but after meeting the beauty queen everything changes. Once he learns she only wants to date the employee of the month, then he decides to do whatever it takes to become the next employee of the month.

The hijinks ensue. This movie will keep you laughing. Its a great movie to just sit down and help you relax after a long week. You will be less tense and able to have a great weekend after watching this movie and laughing your butt off",1408492800,,1008,4.317460317460317

1572768,4,B00005JPA0,"Sometimes it's hard to rank a movie like this. I gave it four stars because it's entertaining and fun in its own way.  It's not great art, of course, but I really enjoyed it. It is what it is, if you know what I mean.  So if you tried to rank it alongside the ""100 Greatest Movies of the Century,"" well, you'd have to give it 2 stars, of course, because it's just an okay movie, nothing to write home about.  But if you are just in the mood for a fun little comedy, as I was when I picked this one, it does the trick nicely.  I usually enjoy  Dax Shepard's work, and this was no exception. Dane Cook does a good job, too. Both were well cast in their roles.

Speaking of Dax Shepard, here's another tip if you like his stuff.  I recently saw him in another little comedy movie, ""Let's Go To Prison,"" directed by the immensely funny Bob Odenkirk (who has a small part in it) and co-starring Will Arnett, who is also very funny in it. If you like the type of humor found in ""Reno 911,"" you would probably also like ""Let's Go To Prison,"" because it's from the same writing team. Again, like ""Employee of the Month,"" it's not great art, but it will make you laugh.",1383696000,,1160,4.128888888888889

It is an enjoyable, light-weight romantic comedy with a scruffy hero, an attention-hungry villain, occasionally pitiable, with irreverent and endearing moments where, within the most everyday environment, friendship, hard work, good and love triumph in the end.  There's a nice mix of odd characters, a bit of low humor and occasional expletives-deleted, but not enough to offend my usually pristine ears.",1350777600,,452,5.352112676056338

There is something charming about this film that I have a hard time putting my finger on. Although the characters and setup are all pretty standard, Dane Cook, Jessica Simpson, and especially Dax Shepard add something extra to their characters that really makes the audience care about them. Not an easy thing to do for ""serious"" actors of any cinematic genre, and yet, here they are, turning a fun little script into a funny, upbeat little gem. Andy Dick, Harlan Williams, Efren Ramirez, and the rest of the cast are also wonderful. While I wouldn't classify this film as the best comedy or romance I've ever seen, I genuinely like this movie--at least enough to buy it and write a review about it.",1347321600,,817,4.72027972027972

1573075,5,B00005JPA0,"I just had to write a little review for this movie after I saw that it is only averaging a 3-star rating. What's up with that? This is a great comedy and one of my favorites. It is silly, but cute and light-hearted and a lot of fun. It has a great cast too with Dane Cook being his normal nutty self, and Dax Shepard, Harland Williams, Andy Dick, Tim Bagley, Efren Ramirez, and Jessica Simpson as employees at a big box store who are all competing for employee of the month. Dane is very funny and Dax is great as the foil to Dane's slacker box boy who is trying to gain favor and respect from Simpson by being nominated employee of the month.

I thought this movie was so good that I'd really like to see the cast return again for a sequel. I read somewhere that Dane Cook is interested in doing a sequel to it, but whether that ever happens is up to Hollywood.

Even Jessica Simpson didn't bother me because they didn't try to inflate her intelligence; they just made her a rather bland character.

The plot isn't original, but watching Vince pretend he was Tom Cruise from Cocktail made me laugh. When I watch this sort of movie I want to laugh and I did just that.

The movie is about a microcosm of society inside a big super store. The pecking order goes something like this: 1. Store manager on top, 2. Checkout clerks,  and 3. Box boys (the bottom feeders). The lead checkout person is the alpha male in the store.  He has been the uncontested ""Employee of the Month"" so many times, he is only one month away from winning a grand prize car with ""pleather"" (better than leather). But, not so fast! - ""Alpha"" meets his match in the form of a box boy nemesis! ""Box Boy"" wants the EOM award, so that he, too, can get into the checker's lounge. Lacking the status to get into the checker's lounge, the bottom feeders make do with a secret makeshift lounge they've built amongst stacks of boxes.

Employee of the Month is a sophomoric attempt at comedy that misses the pretty large satiric target of Costco-like stores in favor of formulaic romance and dwarf jokes: stay far away.",1232841600,,201,4.911764705882353
1573167,2,B00005JPA0,"Meant to be a feel good, nice, nice, nice comedy, it oozes with cuteness and it should really improve the public image of employers such as B.J.'s, Sam's Club and CostCo. It's THAT cute. It's a heartwarming and, indeed, therapeutic viewing experience, watching these young, super-dedicated employees, competing for the employee of the month designation - and the winner gets the car and he could get the girl too.

There is no violence, there is lots of friendship and team work all-over, because both the good guys and the bad guys are team players. The bosses are a little bit demanding but fair and the few illegalities or immoral activities are so mild, they should make us laugh rather than outrage us. In the end, the good guy wins, of course and the not so good guy is humiliated and properly but not severely punished. We are led to believe that all the personal dramas the good guys were experiencing are solved or on their path toward solving and some of those who did not fall asleep or did not walk away might end the viewing with a little smile on their faces.

This shouldn't be on anyone's must-have movies shopping list but those interested to see what might be going behind the scenes inside those mysterious big-box shopping clubs that charge members annual fees for the privilege of being allowed to buy super-family-sized snack boxes and a discount may find the viewing experience tolerable.",1231286400,,1411,4.755102040816326

1573169,4,B00005JPA0,"I watched this movie when it came out almost 2 years ago in January 2007 and at the time I had some trouble following the plot. It deals with 2 employees who fight for the prize of employee of the month at a large department store. They are probably paid just a little above minimum wage. There is great acting all around by Dane Cook, Dax Shepard (who I remember from the movie Baby Mama), and especially Jessica Simpson. Jessica Simpson who is the current employee of the month plays her character very gracefully.

The part that I found funniest in the movie was the race to clean up a spill and where all the employees crash head on; that was a real hoot! I recommend this movie if you are looking for a funny comedy, but I have to say that the plot is weak and hard to follow. I would actually give the movie 3.5 stars.",1228608000,,824,4.215189873417722
1573170,1,B00005JPA0,"Let me start my review of Employee of the Month by saying that I don't think Dane Cook is a great comic.  Despite being impeccably well marketed Cook is not a self-stylized comic and furthermore, he is a horrible actor.  On the flip side for Cook, he is quite lucky to work with Jessica Simpson, who stars as his love interest in this movie, and she is actually even worse.  Even worse than that; the film is directed by Gregory Coolidge who is responsible for writing one of the worse films in recent years,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sorority-Boys/dp/B00006ADFT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sorority Boys</a>.  And even further down the spiral of disappointment we find that Employee of the Month was a financial success and this whole multitude of mediocre talent will continue to make the big bucks.

Zach (Cook) works at Super Club as a box-boy, which is apparently the worse thing you can be.  Super Club is a fictional version of wholesale warehouse companies like BJ's, Costco or Sam's Club.  Zach is intentionally an underachiever and quietly mocks the heroics of Vince (Dax Shepard) with his friends played by comedians Harland Williams, Brian George, and Andy Dick.  Vince is the head cashier and constant winner of the employee of the month honors.  Zach is re-invigorated when Super Club gets a new cashier named Amy (Simpson).  Amy likes guys who win employee of the month so Zach needs to pick it up and compete with Vince.

The story is flat and senseless, and that would be alright with me if I found that the story served as a vehicle for laughs, but it doesn't.  I will say that Dax Shepard does a fine job in his role as the film's villain Vince, so much so I wanted him to come out on top in the end.  The supporting cast is very annoying, especially Andy Dick and Harland Williams, who are normally at least moderately amusing.  The performance of Simpson was rightfully chosen for a Golden Raspberry nomination for worse actress but she lost out to Sharon Stone in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct-2/dp/B000FS9UKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct 2</a>.

Simpson is no real actress but it's not like her role is challenging here. Cook is very good in this as is his nemesis. How about Andy Dick in the supporting role? Classic.

I'm sorry, but I really liked the movie. I can't see why someone would not like it, personally. So it doesn't have the strongest plot. So there are a couple holes (like Vince getting 31 stars the month before. Who works every single day?)? But who really cares? What movie, watched closely enough, doesn't have some plot holes?

1573255,4,B00005JPA0,"I really enjoyed this comedy.  I seemed to like it a lot more than other reviewers here.  Dane Cook has an excellent comedic, endearing presence and he fully delivers here as Zack, the stock boy who is settling in his life and his job till a new cashier who appears like a vision enters the store and he suddenly has a purpose.  He hears she will only date employees of the month and he is strongly initiated to achieve this goal.

Jessica Simpson is the vision of loveliness that Zack and the current emploee of the month Dax Shephard fight over and she is very good in the role.  Immense acting is not called for here.  The movie is really about the two guys fighting for employee of the month and how Dane Cook's character grows in much more complex ways through the process.  Jessica handles herself well, looks beautiful and is quite classy and charming.  In the scenes where sher is given some depth as in the date with Zack and the discussion of her former job she is very believable.  I always believe that for some reason people are just ready to pounce and criticize Ms. Simpson.  It is certainly not warranteed here.

This movie also has heart and pokes fun at all the large bulk department stores, how seriously some people take their jobs and also provides some of the secondary characters to shine.  Andy Dick is hilarious as the vision impaired empoyee who works in the glasses department.

I really do recommend this movie as a fun, sometimes silly but very enjoyable escape.",1220140800,3,1491,4.53932584269663
1573256,4,B00005JPA0,"There are two types of people in the world, those who hate Dane Cook and think he is overrated, and those who think Dane Cook is pretty darn funny. I fall more in the latter category. And here he makes his starring debut, and nobody could save this film except for the Kind of Egoism. Well, add to the fact that it has an interesting locale and this film saves itself from a somewhat shallow grave. And comes off rather funny in the process.

The Cast: Dane Cook brings his personality to the movie, and hits all the right slacker notes. It definitely couln't, or wouldn't have been pulled off very well any other guy, except one who is truly a slacker. The underrated Dax Shepherd also hits all the right notes as his evil and underhanded cashier superstar. Although it is weird to see him with blond hair, but it makes him all the more evil. And Jessica Simpson, while winning no Oscars, doesn't exactly come away with any Razzies as screamingly as her other roles. She comes off a bit likable, even though her character is a bit one-dimensional.

The supporting cast is also rather well done with many underrated talents. Harland Williams, Efren Ramirez and Brian George also do well in what under-used roles they have. And they come off great as always. It's also nice to see Harold Crenshaw, or Tim Bagley in a role that fits him very well. On the other hand, Andy Dick is self-explanatory to his name, and the over-used Danny Woodburn is as annoying as always.

Story: Fairly interesting, and entertaining. Sure, it may be one you've heard a million times, but with the added element of the ""Super Club"" setting, it makes things all the more interesting. It's more of a satire on the blue-collar workshift workers who make their living in dead-end jobs, with nothing to look forward to. And the movie makes this dull existence something of a respectable position. But don't expect me to turn my application in there any time soon. And although this may sound weird, the more poignant moments of the movie were very good (stop laughing, I'm not out of my mind).

Comedy: With all these comedic minds, how could there not be a chuckle or two? Fortunately, there's more than chuckles, and it blows into all-out hilarity in spots. Of course, my humor is the more juvenile 'Family Guy' type, but I was very amused during the whole movie. And while all gags featuring Andy Dick fall flatter than a... never mind, Dax Shepherd's victim gags seem to garner a laugh every time. And the competition scenes are sure to grab a few laughs if only because of the sheer ridiculousness of it all.

Soundtrack: Props to the soundtrack of the movie, with it's wonderful use of Sugarcult's ""Do It Alone,"" NeedToBreathe's ""Shine,"" the cover of ""Surrender,"" and whatever the name is of that song that plays at the beginning of the credits. It's all fun, it's all good, and it's all used very well. It's very rare that a movie has this much music that I actually know, much less like.

Overall, pick it up for a rental, or pick it up in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart, there's enough here to entertain and sustain. Sure, it may not be the greatest film on earth, or even close, but this little comedy does have heart, laughs and a great cast. Or you can just write me off as crazy, which you probably have anyways.",1217808000,,3290,4.539629005059022
1573257,3,B00005JPA0,"Dane Cook is an amazing comedian (many will disagree), but not so much an amazing actor (not that bad though). Jessica Simpson can sing really great, but again not cut out for acting. The appeal to this movie lies in these celebrities it seems, as the movie hits upon so many cliche's. Maybe the acting looks worse due to poor over redundant roles?

Employee of the Month though truly isn't that bad of a movie. Some spots are  actually pretty funny. The whole concept is two employees competing for the desirable girl (obviously Jessica Simpson). In order to do so, one must become employee of the month. Why? Apparently she is attracted to it.

Along the way to achieving his goal, Zack (Dane Cook) meets some odd but friendly people. He gets torn between affection and friends, and ultimately could lead to losing both if he does not balance things correctly. His competitor is the standard class 'A' jerk. The guy who makes you angry from his pathetic attempt at being top dog with a high ego. He's the frequented winner of the employee of the month, and intends to remain this way. For if he becomes it again he gains many luxuries. The relationship between his partner and himself is rather funny.

I think this movie spoofs all of those ""try to beat the golden boy"" kinds of comedy. Dane Cook was at his best in this one as a slacker with a good heart, and Dax Sheperd as the ""golden boy"" is very funny as the obnoxious head cashier. Shepherd is employee of the month seventeen months in a row at the super store Super Club. Jessica Simpson is a new transfer in and Cook believes the way to her heart is to beat Shepherd and become employee of the month. Andy Dick and Harlan Williams add some more comic relief as fellow employees. All in all I feel this one is a keeper since Hollywood has not been producing many good comedies lately. In addition to this movie being funny for adults and teens there is no scene in this movie that makes you feel disgusted or is disgusting to watch.

1573327,3,B00005JPA0,"For what it's worth, the film is marginally entertaining, mainly because it seems to satirize the idea of making it to the top as an employee, even if it is a Sam's Club type of place (in this case, Super Club). With this movie's premise, it certainly should have been fairly funny, but for some reason it seemed to fail at many points. I think this had to do mainly with the lack of originality; everything seems to be standard and characters fail to deviate from their normal ""comedy"" stereotypes. You have the little cliques between the ""bag boy"" types on one side (great performance by Andy Dick), and then you have the ""cashier"" clique. Dax Sheppard plays Vince, the cashier who is not only the fastest, but will do anything to maintain his employee of the month record. On the other hand you have Zack (Dane Cook), the prototypical slacker type who does enough to just get by and not get fired. He's obviously the kind of guy you would root for because he doesn't have an ego, and seems to have a good repertoire with most of the employees (except, of course, Vince). Things begin to take off when Amy (Jessica Simpson) enters the scene, the new hot employee. Vince and Zack hear that she sleeps with employees of the month, and so the quest is on to be the next employee of the month. From here, we see Amy built a good relationship with Zack, all the while not fully aware of the ""contest"" between Zack and Vince.

This comedy is mediocre mainly because it is middle of the road, and doesn't take many chances or stray from the norm at all. We all know that Vince is a jerk just like we know that Zack is the ""good guy"" who tries his best, is honest, and will probably have things work out for him. Then there is the hot girl who just wants to be loved, and find someone to treat her right, for who she really is. We don't have much in the way of original characters or story and, while the film is funny at times and entertaining somewhat, it could have been a lot more.

And certainly original.  I mean, like in every other romantic(ish) comedy, the good guy wins while getting the hot girl, but the setup is interesting, and makes for a lot of comedic moments.

1573429,1,B00005JPA0,"Employee of the month is a waste.  A waste of time, money, effort, film, talent (hardly), you name it.  And to top it off, it is completely unoriginal.  If this movie had been made 10 years ago, you can be sure Sandler would have starred in it.  It borrrows heavily from his formula, most notably Happy Gilmore.

Now I enjoyed Happy Gilmore, I think it's one of Sandler's better early comedies.  But I despised watching this movie rip scene after scene out of it.  Dane is Happy, while Dax Sheppard is Shooter McGavin, the favored employee to win employee of the month for the 18th month in a row.  And Jessica Simpson plays the Virginia Venit role of the girl Dane Cook is after and believes he will get if he does in fact win employee of the month.

Everything is stolen.  The scene where Happy takes Virginia to the ice rink and the zamboni driver sings and the lights come down low, it's in here but takes place with a janitor's floor sweeper in the wholesale warehouse they work at.  The scene where Happy is starting to steal Shooter's thunder and attract more of a crowd when he tees off is in here, except he attracts more customers around his checkout.  The scene where Shooter is secretly practicing how to swing like Happy is in here, except it's Dax trying to wheel around on shoe skates the way Dane does.  We are even treated to Dane's foul mouthed grandma, and by far the most blatant ripoff (or ""homage"" as I'm sure they would put it) is when Dax sings I Want To Kiss You All Over by No Mercy.  The only thing missing is a fist fight with Alex Trebek, or perhaps Pat Sajak.

Dane Cook is pretty funny in his stand up, but if you weren't a Cook fan before, I don't think this movie would help convert anybody.  He just doesn't have anything funny to do or say in this.  And Jessica Simpson... well she's not as bad in this as she was in Dukes of Hazzard, I'll give her that, but it's probably just because she dropped the fake southern accent.  This is the first thing I've seen Dax in, and I can't say he was terrible, but not good enough to make me want to go see another movie with him in it.

It's a dumb comedy so, of course, it's completely predictable, but it's just not funny, so what's the point?  If you don't have a preference between Cook and Sandler, just watch Happy Gilmore instead.  At least then you're not getting sloppy seconds.",1173744000,4,2362,4.322727272727272

1573585,2,B00005JPA0,"""Employee Of The Month"" is a direct ripoff of the movie ""Waiting.""  The only difference is ""Waiting"" is actually funny.  This movie is about a slacker working at a store that supposed to be like Costco who meets a girl and wants to become Employee Of The Month to impress her.  The movie has lots of little one liners that are supposed to be funny, you know their supposed to be funny yet they don't even bring a smirk to your face because they are so used, tired and old.  This movie would have some potential if it weren't for the horrible writing.  If this movie is on TV give it a watch if you have time to kill but don't buy it.",1169337600,6,633,4.1138211382113825
1573586,3,B00005JPA0,"This was an enjoyable film.  My big problem is that it is a standard formula film that I have seen a dozen times over.  They really added nothing new to the equation.  You have a likeable slacker who lives with his grandmother and works a nowhere job for a Sam's Club type company.  You have a mean nemisis who is the head cashier.  Enter a new employee, a drop dead gorgeous girl and the slacker takes it on himself to win her over by being a good employee and become employee of the month.  He then has to battle the mean nemisis with a bunch of gags with his group of strange friends.  Then at the end, he has a misunderstanding with the girl when some of his lies and deeds come out.  But in the end he redeems himself and all is good.  Cook is good in the role.  I would have like to see him ad lib some more and make the movie more his own.  Simpson is okay, her big contribution to the movie is various low cut tops.  Dax I thought was great with his Pedro like boxer.  A fair budget and decent acting save this one.  I would rent it first rather than making a blind buy.",1169251200,18,1078,4.023584905660377
1573587,3,B00005JPA0,"I think Dane Cook is funny, but not so funny here. I felt like someone hit him over the head with a sledge hammer a few times to dumb down his comedy for this flick. There were definitely a few LAUGH OUT LOUD moments in this film, and Andy Dick should take the credit for a few of them, but other than those few moments, this film is boring. The script tries to get all romantic on the viewer, and for one scene, it works (Jessica and Dane getting sweet about big ears), but it's really just a flat comedy about Costco and trying to scan items really fast.",1169251200,6,556,4.110091743119266
1573588,3,B00005JPA0,"I can't believe I'm saying this but I must. I enjoyed watching `Employee of the Month' starring Dane Cook and the infamous Jessica Simpson in this light-hearted comedy/romance about finding love and selling in bulk. I didn't intend to watch this film because I thought it was going to be yet another vehicle for Miss Simpson to giggle and jiggle her way to the top of the Hollywood food chain. However I was eventually swayed at my daughters insistance and agreed to a viewing.

It definitely was not what I expected. Dane Cook was quite enjoyable in the part of Zack, box boy at the local Super-Club mega store and Jessica Simpson played it straight and somewhat subdued in her role as Amy, the stores new cashier.

Obviously there's nothing deep or profound here, just good, clean fun that the whole family can enjoy. Watch and see who's the greatest cashier of them all!",1169078400,16,873,4.662337662337662
1573589,2,B00005JPA0,"Movies that hinge on slapstick and sight gags often try to transcend their own silliness by fashioning around themselves an easy-to-swallow moral coating.  In some cases, this actually propels the story (see Sandler's ""Click"").  In others, it comes across as a cheesy afterthought.  Employee of the Month is the latter, a flick that would've worked much better if it had dumped the cheese.

Dane Cook (the ever-more-renowned college-circuit comic) hides behind himself as Zack, a box boy at the buy-in-bulk megastore Super Club.  He's happy coasting by until the store gets a new cashier, Amy (played with perma-grin by Jessica Simpson).  Discovering that Amy had a thing for the Employee of the Month at her last job, Zack enters into a contest for the title with the store's current Alpha Male, head cashier Vince (Dax Shepard, providing us with one of the movie's only interesting characters).

Zack is both helped and hindered by a host of marginally humorous supporting characters.  There's a woefully underused Andy Dick playing the sight-challenged Lon, Efren Ramirez as Jorge (a character that is far, far, far too similar to his Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite), and Harland William -- whimsically weird as always -- has some of the best lines as a stocker named Russell (""She'll slide into the sack quicker than a singed Koala looking for an all-night burn center"").

Zack's quest involves the typical ups-and-downs, some easily forecast misunderstandings, and his losing sight of What Really Matters.  All of this while he deals with Vince's uninspired machinations and the whims of an easily-spooked boss named Glen Gary (the store is owned by his older brother, Glen Ross -- a Mamet reference in a Jessica Simpson movie; try wrapping your head around that one).

The end result, I'm afraid, is much less than the sum of its parts, and that's due mostly to the film's fear of being too inappropriate.  The premise is hammy enough without dialogue that pulls so many punches, and without a story that arcs so carefully around a Lesson To Be Learned (in this case: be loyal to your friends ... or don't be afraid to take risks ... or always be yourself ... or be yourself by taking the risk to stay loyal to your friends.  Something like that).  Because of this, something that could've been meaty (if not happily goofy) is, instead, just corny broth.

The DVD is aided by more than a few interesting special features, including a few clips of ad libs (most of them involving Andy Dick), an alternate opening, and three Dane Cook segments (including a pretty funny clip called, ""Car Brakes Attached to Horn"").  These, though, are just window dressing around a view that's not that great to begin with.",1168732800,5,2708,4.905701754385965
1573590,5,B00005JPA0,i went to see it opening weekend cause im a huge jessica simpson fan. now i was disappointed with her performance in dukes of hazzard and wasn't expecting much here either; but i was pleasantly surprised. i think dane cook did a great job too and theres a really good storyline too. there is also a good moral at the end. it is also very funny.,1168387200,9,344,4.2272727272727275
1573591,2,B00005JPA0,I never expect much from chick flicks.  But this one actually hurt my head.  I'm all for no-brainer comedies.  The kind that takes no cognitive function whatsoever...I find they're good for background noise when magazine reading or painting one's toe nails.  Not Employee of the Month.  There's about five minutes worth of funny in this movie.  The rest of it is a waste of your life.  And mine.  I don't HATE hate it.  But I wouldn't watch it again.  Not even for the background noise.,1168041600,10,486,4.6117647058823525
1573592,5,B00005JPA0,"In a world where men womanize and then cheat on their women, this movie got down to basics when Zach (Dane Cook) learns he must court Miss Amy (Jessica Simpson) to be the better man than the lead cashier - whom Amy always finds attractive since he's always the Employee of the Month. In fact, the lead cashier has been EOM so many times, he is about to make a record. Well of course, in the pursuit of a girl, a contest is forged... and the steps taken will have you laughing til your sides hurt - if you're into slapstick comedy, and the Dane Cook sense of humor.

What I found was not the foul mouthed, women are a dime a dozen Dane, but Zach was a guy with a sweet and tender heart under his male pride... sensitive, yet with a streak you need to watch out for.

I laughed so hard - and halfway thru the movie leaned to my husband and said - we are buying this when it comes out on DVD - and yes, we have already pre-bought it! I cannot wait - such a heartwarming tale and funny too! Way to go EOM and it's cast & producers!",1167955200,10,1027,4.004878048780488
1573593,4,B00005JPA0,"Funny movie...not awesomely great, but you get your good laughs.

Movie is about a boxboy trying to become employee of the month, going against a ""top notch"" cashier while trying to impress a girl.

The plot is pretty dumb, but its pretty silly at times. The so called rivalry between this boxboy and cashier gets to be funny, with each person plotting deeds against the other.

Its not a movie to remember, but id watch it, as it does entertain you for a while.",1166572800,10,462,4.476190476190476
1573594,5,B00005JPA0,"This movie was hilarious!!! Okay, it may not be oscar material exploding with computer graphics, touching dialogue, or emotional nostalgia, but it had everything a great comedy should have...well-developed (though a bit steriotypical) characters, social sattire (in the case of Wal Mart), and a fast, and funny script with extremely comedic antics throughout. Though the humor is a bit crude at times, it is very clever, quick, and witty. The minor and slapstick stunts are awesome, and though this movie and it's plot were not overly original, many of the scenes and ideas displayed were. I suppose if you nit-pick this movie appart and judge every aspect then you may not enjoy it as much as I did. However, this movie was not made to be judged, it was made to entertain; and that it does, side-splittingly-well, I might add! This movie was awesome...by far the funniest movie in the fall of 2006! I highly recommend it!!!",1164672000,3,924,4.89171974522293
