2054552,1,B00021Q51A,"This is the first film I've ever felt compelled to review. It was so very terrible I just had to warn others.

Where to begin -- let's see . . .

Well, for starters, the actors' performances were so awful you'd think you were watching a high school play. Particularly bad was Mike Patton. I was delighted to see his character, David, killed off early in the story as I thought it would mean I no longer had to see the dreadful acting continue. But no -- I'd failed to realize Patton was also playing the role of Frank (and doing an even lousier job with that one).

Aside from the bad acting, there was the meaningless, distracting switch-off between color and black-and-white scenes every few minutes. It just leaves you wondering, ""What the hell was that about?""

For a story presumably set in the mid 1960s, the anachronisms abound: a smoke detector is clearly visible in one scene, another scene shows 1980s-era exterior lighting on the side of the tire garage, a 21st-century synthesized-voice weather radio playing in the background as Ed makes her search of the house. Those are silly things that should have been easy to catch during production.

And speaking of silly - the story itself was just silly and predictable. And the whole film, itself was pretentious and boring.

Gosh what a horrible film.",1275868800,,1310,4.698689956331878
2054553,3,B00021Q51A,"Firecrackers cinematography was extremely good for the budget though the transition scenes from black and white to color was annoying at times. The scene at the carnival bugged me the most. The colors were extremely bright and saturated. It was to show the difference between the reality of the movie and the fantasy part of it but even the scenes that were suppose to be fantastical made me want to sleep.

It's called Firecracker due to the more deeper you get into the story the shorter the fuse gets like on a firecracker. I've watched this film multiple times yet the symbolism the director was trying to make didn't really make any sense at all. Mainly the woman who lives in a field next to a tree that has bottles hung all over it.",1255219200,,739,4.514925373134329
2054554,1,B00021Q51A,"Bill Cosby once had a line about the birth of his first son.  He said that he was excited and anxious in the hospital, until he saw his son for the first time.  He said he managed to maintain the smile of an expectant father, but he said he was horrified at what he saw emerge from his wife's womb.  He said he wanted to turn to the intern who handed his son to him and say: ""Maybe we should put him back in and let him cook a little longer.""
As a big Mike Patton fan, I anxiously awaited the release of this movie.  I maintained my smile to about the halfway point.  At that point, I was unable to maintain the smile.  I decided that watching a movie of me watching the movie would've been more entertaining.  It reminded me of a movie done by a film student.  A bad one.  I think the class would've called it a worthy effort, but they would've given it an 'F'.  They would've said that the acting was stilted, it was poorly cut, and it was confusing in a manner that you were sure that the director had not intended.  Patton should probably stick to what he does better than anyone out there right now. Karen Black was good, but her performance wasn't exceptional.  The rest were terrible.  I normally don't enjoy seeing others slam any project that a person has cut blood over, but if I can save one Patton fan the disappointment of seeing him act I'll consider this a worthwhile post.",1239667200,,1388,4.231939163498099
2054555,2,B00021Q51A,"Anyone calling this movie brilliant is either too obsessed with Patton or one of Balderson's paid employees. Yes, the opening is brilliant and the colors and style of this film are nothing short of fantastic. But Karen Black's performance is beyond emberassing, and Mike Patton even said himself he is no actor - and it shows.

It was very uncomfortable and difficult to watch this film in its entirety, which is a real shame because it could have been an incredible experience. Instead the potential was shattered by phony acting. Sad to say it, but avoid this movie at all costs.",1220918400,,581,4.752475247524752
2054556,5,B00021Q51A,"like everything mike patton associates himself with this movie is a few years ahead of its time. most people won't get it. most people will be confused. most people will find it too abstract and weird to be entertaining. not unlike a lot of the music patton does. sure the visuals give you a rise at first, as do a lot of pattons crazy noises in his music. but if you don't actually use your brain to digest the film like the music then you probably will become bored and confused.  the visuals are great. the acting is great. i love the slightly overacting style, it's perfect for this movie. the direction is great. the story is good..nothing extraordinary. but the way it's told is fantastic. i didn't even realize karen black was playing two different roles until the end of the movie. that's how good she is as well. i have a feeling this movie is going to become sort of a cult classic, and become appreciated much more in years to come. my only gripe at all is balderson seems to be a little cocky in his promoting of the movie haha, but hey .. he doesn't lie",1185494400,,1066,4.33
2054557,2,B00021Q51A,"I was hoping to really like this movie, but just couldn't. Having Patton and Black take on dual roles was an interesting idea, metaphorically speaking... but in both cases, the need to keep the characters ""different"" led to one persona being shallow and over-acted compared to the other. The mixing of black-and-white and color is a bit of a cliche, and I felt that it, and the soundtrack, were /sometimes/ used as a replacement for building genuine emotional scenes. There were some truly gripping scenes throughout the film, but the lack of character development hurts the film greatly -- only one character shows /any/ growth throughout the story, and she isn't even the protagonist. The ""deus ex machina as a metaphor for... well, what do you want it to be a metaphor for? That? Oh yeah, that's what I wrote it to be. Honest."" nature-girl and the ending she brings to the movie cap the entire production with a disappointing ending as well.

2 stars. Not a bad movie, but not a particularly engaging one, either. A few standout scenes, all of which deserve better company than that which surrounds them.",1181692800,,1107,4.795811518324608
2054558,5,B00021Q51A,"A very intense film that seems to have some Lynch ideas, but more akin to Hitchcock to real film fan.  Even some of the acting direction harkens back to the fifties, I'm reminded of Night of the Hunter during the scene with Frank and the shopgirl, the almost bad acting over the top performance.  I guess this got panned as a Lynch wannabe, but I guess I found it a lot more disturbing than Lynch's twisted sense of humor and irony.  And I love Lynch..",1179100800,,452,4.294117647058823

2054560,3,B00021Q51A,"Firecracker by Cirio H. Santiago is a low budget wannabee martial arts flick elevated by a couple of memorable nude shots with Jillian Kesner who was allegedly a real karate champ. She plays Susanne Carter whose sister got murdered when she got mixed with a couple of drug traffickers.

We really don't get too much into what happened to the sister in fact we get almost zero scenes with her (nor care how she died). Instead, we are treated to a lot of fights scenes with Jillian Kesner often fighting borderline nude!!!

It's one of these movies obviously knew it's limitations and tried to sell a few more tickets and copies by pouring in nudity to the viewer. With that said Jillian Kesner has a hot, tight body that sizzles on the screen. The villains are forgettable and one of the other lead actors in the movie is far too ugly to be taken seriously as a love interest for Jillian.

With that said, it's an entertaining, cheesy flick that it's a prime example of the type of the thing that the 70's and 80's produced.",1172275200,,1023,4.489247311827957
2054561,1,B00021Q51A,"I was very exited about this movie. I waited and waited for it to come out on DVD so I could see it. I even ordered the documentary from the website and watched it long before the actual film. Being a big Mike Patton fan also boosted my anticipation of this film that was reviewed as being ""the kind of film David Lynch wishes he was still capable of making"", or something along those lines. David Lynch is a genius and has made some of my all-time favorite films. The notion that Firecracker even approaches Lynch is absurd. This movie sucked and is an insult to film-making.

I will say that some of the visuals were artistic and looked beautiful, but Balderson's alternation between color and B&W seemed unnecessary and without reason. If I'm wrong, please correct me. Using both color and B&W can add to a movie if done with taste and style. It was excessive and annoying in this pretentious piece.

One of my biggest complaints is of the dialogue. I found myself in constant agitation at how terrible and pointless the characters were. Mike Patton did display quite a presence and could be a good actor with some practice, though I think he should probably just stick with music. His scenes were the only thing about any of the acting that I enjoyed.

It seemed like the movie was very rushed; like the film-makers were trying to save money on film by doing a single take for each scene. There were some camera shots with good angles and composition that could stand alone as art, but unfortunately that's not enough to save the film.

When it was finished I thought to myself that it seemed like the movie was written by an eighth grade cheerleader trying to be edgy and artsy. My advice is simply this: don't waste money even renting this movie. Stick with David Lynch if you want good art films.",1166313600,,1803,4.521472392638037
2054562,2,B00021Q51A,"The plot and pacing of this movie are terrible... Patton is great in one role, horrible in another... it is indeed painful to watch all of it.  The movie cannot be compared to Lynch.  Karen black is good in her roles.  And I agree, the visuals are interesting, it is already a cult classic.",1159833600,,290,4.333333333333333
2054563,1,B00021Q51A,This one is a total dud. Come on one David Lynch is enough. I'm assuming the director's pitch went something like this: It's Mullholland Drive at a carnival! That's assuming he saw Mullholland Drive or any films before he started directing.,1158105600,,240,4.878048780487805
2054564,2,B00021Q51A,"Steve Balderson's ""Firecracker"" could be better titled ""Sparkler.""  It doesn't exactly pop with excitement.  The themes are dark.  Male rape, especially by an older brother on a younger possibly mentally retarded boy, is a subject that needs sensitive handling.  Instead Faith No More's frontman Mike Patton is cast in the dual role of David who rapes & probably has a history of abuse with his brother Jimmy and as the circus sadist Frank who surgically scars his lead singer Sandra (Karen Black) so she will be unattractive to other men.  There really is no redeeming grace for either character, with Frank's fake goatee and strained sadism being less than convincing.  The movie really stars newcomer Jak Kendall whose naked behind is frequently in view.  As Jimmy, Kendall seems like a deeply disturbed lad; whether caused by mental retardation or severe stress of sexual abuse, it is hard to say.  Karen Black's Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination was way back in 1970 for ""Five Easy Pieces.""  She has worked consistently in many films, but has failed to hit with a role that propels her back before the public eye.  This film won't do it, although as the Bible-quoting mother Eleanor whose husband is failing and eventually must be put in a nursing home and as the exotic aging lounge singer Sandra that captures Jimmy's imagination, she does a good job.  Her red cape flying in the final scene is somewhere between M. Night Shamalyan and the Asian film ""Heroes"" in its visual brilliance.  Susan Traylor from ""A River Runs Through It"" & ""Finding Graceland"" plays the police chief Ed.  She adds intensity to an underwritten role.  Unfortunately, the perverse events never amount to much of a story, even with an act of violence as the climactic capper.  David Lynch uses style to elevate the story to a new level.  Here, there is more style than story.  It's nice to see Karen Black, but beyond that there is not much to attract an audience.  Taxi!",1155686400,,1958,4.828828828828829
2054565,4,B00021Q51A,"Bought this for my fiance, the Mike Patton fan.  We heard about it back when Dennis Hopper was going to be in it.  Too bad he wasn't, though I don't think even he could've helped.

Mike Patton was superb as David, though it seemed his role as Frank was lacking. It seemed forced.  However, I don't lay that one on Patton, but moreso Steve Balderson.  It seemed that there wasn't a clear direction as to what kind of man Frank was to be.  I look foward to the possibility of patton acting again in the future.

Karen Black was absolutely incredible and believable in both of her roles.  I hope that she receives some kind of accolades for her performance.

Jak Kendall was impressive in his first movie role.  Although it was never made clear about what was wrong with the kid.  Again, this falls on the director.

As a whole, this was an interesting story to tell but I think the director got so wrapped up in the artistic imagery (crucifixes everywhere) that he didn't focus on the story enough. The part of Pearl was of no use to the movie. I would've rather seen more of the back history of Frank and Sandra. the end of Sandra's story was artistic yes, but having her and the rest of the carnies vanish to the next town would've been more believable and fitting. And the scene with Patton and Jak on the floor of Sandra's wagon was disturbing. Leaving it implied and open to the imagination as happened earlier in the film was fine, but did having that scene REALLY help the movie that much?",1154908800,,1494,4.392727272727273
2054566,2,B00021Q51A,"I can't believe some critic described this as ""the movie David Lynch wished he could still make."" Give me a break! It's more like the movie David Lynch is GLAD he never made. With a skilled director this could've been amazing, but the direction/editing is amateur at best. Some of the colors and shots are well done, Karen Black is great, Patton is convincing when he's playing the older brother...but the rest of the acting is horrible. It's never quite clear (whether it's due to directing &/or acting) whether Jimmy is half-retarded or just psychologically screwed up. The psycho Indian girl comes across as a cheesy Log Lady (Twin Peaks).

Do yourself a favor & rent some David Lynch. This is a turkey!",1154044800,,706,4.739837398373984
2054567,1,B00021Q51A,"This is honestly one of the worst films (I use this term loosely) I have ever sat through. A past review said it was good script, I can't believe there was a script. Between all the uh's and um's that come out of the ""actors"" mouths, one would have to think they were coming up with the dialogue as they went along. This is the unfortunate downside of a time when anyone with a DV recorder and Final Cut can make a movie and put it out. True, it allows many unknown artists the opportunity to realize their vision without the help of some corporate mega-studio giving them the go ahead, but on the other hand, you might end up having to watch something called ""Firecracker"". Do yourself a favor, stare at a wall for an hour and a half instead.",1153267200,,743,4.276595744680851
2054568,5,B00021Q51A,"I was bummed to see some of the negative reviews posted regarding Steve Balderson's FIRECRACKER and felt I should offer up my own view. I caught this film when it was giving a roadshow screening in San Francisco last year. It blew me away on so many levels. True, it is not flawless. Few films are. However, it is full of ideas, challenging concepts, stunning visuals and some very interesting performances from a cast that could have been lifted from a Fellini film. The story (aka plot) is simple and almost secondary to the ideas presented by the visuals. Balderson never allows the audience the benefit of knowing if we are watching a horror film or a very dark comedy about coming of age. In the end, I felt as if I had been led into an interesting homage to David Lynch by way of a painting come to life. Karen Black is amazing. The music is great and the visuals captivate.

This film will not satisfy the cineplex audience but it will offer entertainment for those of us who like to be challenged and who appreciate the opportunity to see the work of an emerging artist who has created something via much blood, sweat and tears.

Art is subjective and I appreciate that some will not like the vision that Steve Balderson has created but I hope folks who support the arts will take a chance and step into this dark and twisted world. I can't wait to see what this director comes up with next.",1153094400,,1399,4.439688715953308
2054569,1,B00021Q51A,"I love Patton's music. But this? WTF? I'm sorry I did not enjoyed watching Firecracker.

2054570,2,B00021Q51A,"I would label this movie as more experimental than independant. I bought this because I am a huge fan of Mike Patton's music, and I really appreciate Karen Black's work in all the movies I have seen her in. Karen Black makes this movie salvageable. Much of the other acting I witnessed seemed forced, as if the actors didn't delve into their characters apart from the surface of the script. It looks very amatuer, even for an independant film.

The directing and editing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Several scenes with dialouge lacked natural pace, and some had a jerky start. However, at various intervals near the end of the movie, I was blown away by good cinematography.

It seems perhaps that this film could have used a bit more scrutiny/fine tuning before its release. Or perhaps it would have been better off left in the director's private collection.

After receiving this movie today, I will be reselling it. To my great disappointment, I did not find it shocking or disturbing or at all Hitchcock-like.  And although Karen Black is brilliant in here, it pains me to view the film.",1152316800,,1095,4.6875
2054571,4,B00021Q51A,"I knew nothing about this movie until visiting my local video store last week.  I saw the display cover and looked at it and I noticed that Mike Patton was on of the actors.  So me being a huge Mike Patton fan(Faith No More,Mr. Bungle,Fantomas,Tomahawk,etc...) I had to rent this.  I'm glad to say that this film did not dissapoint and Patton gave an outstanding performance.  I cant really explain much of the plot.  Its one of those films that you just have to watch to understand.  Its about a string of weird events that actually happened in a small town in Kansas some years ago.  It does have some disturbing scenes, but don't most ""independent"" films.  This kept reminding me of a David Lynch movie the more I watched it.  Great direction, great acting, and a killer musical score.  If you are into weird ""artsy"" films or are a fan of Mike Patton or Karen Black you should definately watch this.",1152144000,,902,4.512345679012346
2054572,2,B00021Q51A,"On the front of the DVD cover you will notice ""Hitchcockian - Roger Ebert""

This is clever marketing. Not a lie but misleading. Roger Ebert says

""There is the Hitchcockian scene where the mother asks at the cleaners for an ""astringent"" to remove the ""shoe polish"" on her carpet.""

OK, so a scene is Hitchockian, not the movie. I have noticed that critics are much easier on indie films and foreign films, I believe this is the case here.

Balderson is a hard worker, a smart businessman, very creative, and I like his directing. As a writer though? That's where I think this movie falls flat. I was into the movie for the first half hour or so, until Mike Patton died. Then, I fell asleep twice after that and was painfully bored.

Visually the movie has some great shots. The burning fire for the opening credits, the bright colors, great landscape shots, shots of the carnival, etc. But, without good dialogue and pacing it just doesn't make a good movie. Some of the acting is too B Movie-ish and I like B-Movies. If it wasn't for the presence of Karen Black this movie would be unwatchable.

I really wanted to like this movie and have been following it for years. I wouldn't have watched it if it didn't have Mike Patton in it. Mike Patton played a bigger role than I thought and it was interesting to see him act. This is a must see for Patton fans.

Balderson is quite young still and I think with a solid and exciting script he could really do something with it. I just hope he doesn't continue to direct only movies he writes. The ""making of"" documentary of this movie is quite egotistical and winded. That may be the main problem here. This movie to me played like a long student film project with a larger budget. Some moments of greatness but too self-indulgent.

I look forward to see what else Balderson brings to the silver screen and I hope this movie opens the door giving access to a variety of great writers' screenplays.",1152144000,,1941,4.478753541076487

  To the guy who only gave it 1 star, stick to movies like Gladiator and Independance Day. Obviously you have a 1 track mind to not appreciate something as beautiful as this.

8020058,5,B00021Q51A,If you do not like the artists in the film or films that take a bit of artistic license you may not like this.  There is a great usage of the same actors in multiple characters to move the plot along.,1373673600,,200,3.8780487804878048
8020059,1,B00021Q51A,"I had heard great things about is movie and I could not wait until it came out on DVD. I forgot about it for awhile. Then I noticed it on Amazon so I decided to buy it. I was told that it was a great cinema masterpiece that ranked along the lines of Blue Velvet. Again this is an independent film, and I try to support Independent movies because some of the best movies have been Independent films.

Needless to say, I was disappointed. It is about a young man who is abused at home and sneaks off to town to go to a carnival. He becomes somewhat obsessed with Karen Black's character but she seems to be under some sort of spell by the owner of the carnival. There are some interesting filming techniques that you do not see in movies often, but other than that I did not quite get the story. I am not sure if the characters are ghost or trapped souls that move from place to place or what, but sadly I can not recommend spending any large amount of money on this movie. It's too long and hard to follow. Rent or buy at your own risk.",1361404800,,1035,4.098522167487685
8020060,5,B00021Q51A,"This small thriller/surreal comedy/drama was made waaaay off the grid, in Kansas, by a truly independent film maker named Steve Balderson, who has been making Kansas based films, with a largely local cast and crew, for a decade now.

Shot in a mixture of stark black and white and lurid color - both looks are beautiful - this film manages to transcend economies of budget, an uneven set of performances and even some dicey choices in story telling. Because for every cringe-worthy moment, there are a number of moments that are striking, thought provoking, beautiful, poetic, disturbing, often all at once.

The score is pretty terrific as well.

This retells a true story of a small town murder, but in a style I can only describe as what we might have seen had David Lynch made `Fargo'.

It's a pity some of the actors aren't up to the challenges of the project, because I think that weakness leads to some moments coming off as campier than they're meant to.

But as much as I could complain about specifics, there's the excitement of a unique, talented voice here, telling a story in a different, mostly very compelling way.

But you have to approach it in an open, even 'forgiving' mood.  This isn't about perfection, but about taking risks.",1316476800,,1247,4.71889400921659
8020061,1,B00021Q51A,"This is a rediculous movie. Terrible acting, combined with a poorly written screenplay makes for a long setting. The characters were developed so poorly, that even through the terrible abuses that were heaped upon them, I simply couldn't bring myself to care.
The only saving grace of the film was the intensity of the color scenes.
I only paid $1.65 for this movie and got it used... I still think I overpaid.",1303171200,,410,4.708333333333333
