8224925,5,B000WPJT3M,"If you like real life stories then this TV series is for you. You will learn from it that in theory a person is innocent until proven guilty. However, in reality an accused person continues to be guilty until proven innocent. Reed Hadley's presentation of the cases is clear, straightforward, and educational. I recommend another TV series with the same actor ""Racket Squad"". The ""Public Defender"" TV series had been presented on CBS from 1954 to 1955. Total of 69 episodes were produced.",1342396800,2,488,4.891566265060241
