8428931,5,B004GPOQBY,"Going to the game was a lot of fun. And this dvd is a very well made souvenir of the complete FSN Detroit television broadcast. I've got quite a few of the tv sports broadcasts on official dvd's (see my listmania for many more) and this one really gets it right.

In addition to the regular game, the dvd includes the full pregame and post game shows on FSN. And it is the complete broadcast so nothing is cut out because the rights weren't cleared for certain parts. There is the full intro with Jeff Daniels and even the sponsorship logos (""This game is brought to you by..."") are fully intact.

Best of all, the video is presented in the HDtv aspect ratio of the full 16x9 picture in anamorphic widescreen. You are getting the full picture that was recorded in the broadcast truck. And while it is not in HD due to being on a dvd instead of a much more expensive to make blu-ray, the picture looks flawless with no noticeable compression. It looks like it was taken directly from the master source, instead of something recorded of television. In fact the pregame and the game footage do not have the FS Detroit logo in the upper right signifying it is directly from the truck without any watermarks or logos added by the studio. (It does of course have all the graphics like the score box with the running clock.) The post game feature does have the logo and the bottom ticker but the quality is just as good as the rest of the segments.

It really is a shame Michigan has not promoted or advertised this more at some of their events like they did with the game program and aerial photos. This is a very well made product that deserves more recognition and I only wish more games could be presented as faithfully and high quality as this.",1304380800,,1742,4.403726708074534
