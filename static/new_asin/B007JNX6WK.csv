5091627,5,B007JNX6WK,"This was a profoundly insightful documentary about the nature and state of the current epidemic of misinformation perpetuated by the liberal agenda.  Mr. King has done an excellent job showing the truth from the ""other side"" of the argument that rarely has the chance to be heard.  In this documentary you have the chance to hear the voice of the working man that deals with the consequences of the wolf ""reintroduction"" program on a practical daily basis.  Prepare yourself to hear some truth behind the political wrangling that forced the unwelcome increase in wolves in the Yellowstone Basin and surrounding areas!

This documentary is a landmark piece in the ongoing discussion of the wolf issue!  The information found in the interviews and over-arching commentary is probably new for some who are just now coming into the wolf debate; and quite possibly, the same could also be said for those who HAVE been around this for a long time!

Prepare to be challenged by this documentary.  Ultimately, whether you accept or reject the premise of the director's line of thought, this is a documentary worth watching.",1333497600,6,1115,4.994594594594594
5091628,5,B007JNX6WK,"Crying Wolf takes a new angle on a new subject. I learned things I never knew about the nature of wolves, their habits and migrations, and how they critically affect ranchers and sportsman.

Parts of the film are of substantially lower quality, specifically the footage covering the beginning of J.D's journey, and a few interviews with less than crystal audio. However, most of the film is in beautiful HD, and looks just as good as the research that is contained inside.

I first saw Crying Wolf online. But after seeing Crying Wolf at the 2012 SAICFF (where it won the Jubilee Award for Best Creation Documentary), I came home with a DVD and watched it about 4 more times, and have been sharing my copy with friends and family. My criteria for a good film is based on how many times I can re-watch it, and Crying Wolf passes with flying colors.

This would be a great gift for anyone interested in the outdoors.",1333497600,9,914,4.560975609756097
5091629,5,B007JNX6WK,"Educational for all!  Both those living in the cities that have no clue (and usually the ones promoting wolf introduction) and for those of us living in the rural areas.  This video will help greatly reduce the ignorance by those that have been fed an agenda that promotes deliberately dumping predators on people that live in rural areas.

Those of us in rural areas, suffer greatly because of the ignorance of those that are far removed from the threats that these predators bring to our homes and family.",1358726400,4,507,4.738636363636363
5091630,5,B007JNX6WK,"When this documentary was first released, I was fortunate to watch it online for free. It was so good and informative that I purchased a copy so I could show it to others. I documents the fraud of the reintroduction of wolves and how protecting them beyond what the government said they would has resulted in hurting industries such as ranching and guiding for hunters.",1357862400,2,369,4.6923076923076925
5091631,5,B007JNX6WK,Out of control and unaccountable government agencies. This documentary shows you why Congress needs to audit the BLM and other programs that are taking over our wild lands with impunity.,1356480000,2,186,5.233333333333333
5091632,5,B007JNX6WK,This really was an eye opener.  You really need to view and make your own decisions on the reintro of the wolf.,1353888000,2,111,4.045454545454546
5091633,4,B007JNX6WK,Very interesting. I live in the midwest we don't have this big of a problem with wolfs. The documentry kept my interest from start to finish.,1353024000,2,141,4.461538461538462
5091634,5,B007JNX6WK,"This opened my mind to the delemia our neighbors are enduring
with the intereference of our government and the intrusion into
the balance of nature caused by the government.  This earth
was created in balance and when we try to make it something
different we need to think about this situation.
Needs to be shared with everyone.",1350777600,,328,4.754385964912281
5091635,5,B007JNX6WK,"I've watched this 2 or 3 times and gone back to various sections of it several times.  Shared it with everyone I can share it with.  It is intriguing, well orchestrated and chock full of facts that the public at large has no idea existed.  If you live in the West and have outdoor experience, you will be singing Hallelulah!  If you have no outdoor experience, it's time to get over the cute pix of pups and adult wolves wiping their snouts.  The Canadian wolves introduced into the Rocky Mountains are cold blooded killers.  Given the opportunity to take you as their prey, they will not give one ounce of crap how cute pix are of you and your kids (pups).  Growing up with native wolves (yes, they existed), I knew of the danger but as they really did not bother us much on a working Ranch in WY, I had no idea of the breadth, scope and manner in which they kill.  To have purposefully planted these animals in unsuspecting States with ILLEGAL money while in the employ of the United States Government (you and me), is one of the biggest travesties ever perpetrated on the rural public.  And the fallout has just begun.  MUST watch if you have any desire to know the truth about anything!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crying-Wolf/dp/B007JNX6WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crying Wolf</a>",1341360000,3,1334,4.968468468468468
5091636,5,B007JNX6WK,"This film is a must-see, not only for people living in the northwestern states, but everywhere!  This documentary has been viewed by people around the world. It is an eye-opening expose of what is behind the environmentalist movement and corrupt government politics.  It reveals the truth about wolves and the damage they have done, and are doing, to elk herds, cattle, etc., and the money they are costing ranchers.  It also demonstrates how our tax dollars are used illegally by environmentalists and their corrupt bureaucrat henchmen for purposes never intended to curtail our freedoms and destroy our way of life.  Hats off to J.D. for daring to reveal the truth!",1333670400,6,667,5.036363636363636
5091637,5,B007JNX6WK,"Crying Wolf gives a thought-provoking analysis of an issue mainly taking place in the mountain states, but which stems all the way from problematic decisions made by federal organizations. The reintroduction of wolves (specifically to Yellowstone National Park) is not mainly a celebration of a noble, divinely-created animal (though they are such), but is also part of an extreme environmentalist agenda which is destroying ranchers' livelihoods, herds of big game, and our tradition of sportsmanship.

It shows spectacular footage of my beloved native Montana, yet reveals why we can't take our land or our wildlife for granted anymore. We must be vigilant to know the antagonistic agendas which are alive and well, all around us--and J.D. King (producer of Crying Wolf) details this exceptionally for the viewer, whether you are previously knowledgeable on the subject or not. I highly recommend watching this beautiful and enlightening film and letting it impact your perception of wolves and the wilderness. America needs more documentaries like this one.",1333584000,20,1060,5.463414634146342
5091638,5,B007JNX6WK,"What an amazing video!

This video was extremely well thought-out, filled with informative interviews and excellent footage. He proved his points very well.

It's well worth the price...I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to know the REAL story behind the wolf problem out west.

8518428,1,B007JNX6WK,"It is with great shame that I am required to give at least one star for this terribly biased and lop-sided ""documentary"". Crying Wolf should be used as an example of BAD investigative journalism (if it qualifies as such) in academic courses for journalism majors. The interviews were contrived and appeared rehearsed. The animation sequence to graph wolf depredation on livestock was insultingly elementary. Crying Wolf becomes farcical when Mr King insists that the wolf reintroduction issue is fundamentally a Christian issue. This detracts from many who wish for a more balanced approach (as opposed to Greenpeace or the Sierra Club) to tackling environmental issues. The great majority of whom are not religious in any sense. There was absolutely no attempt by Mr King to seek out the perspective from wolf biologists and wolf advocates. Documentaries by Josh Fox and Rob Stewart at least make an effort to get the other perspective.

There was also a scene where Mr King takes Native American regalia and mockingly dances with it. This is not surprising since Mr King is affiliated with the rather racist Citizens for Balanced Use (CBU) a so-called populist movement ""serving"" the interests of rural Americans. CBU attempted to legally block the release of bison in Montana in 2012. The bison release effort was part of the cooperation between Native Americans and conservation groups. Bison are vital to the culture of Montana's Native Americans.",1449100800,,1452,5.178723404255319
8518429,1,B007JNX6WK,"Another Biased Propaganda Film...Living and woking in Montana I have seen both sides of this issue. There are many ranchers that disagree with this film and its content. People use these tactics to promote a doomsday scenario. The world is a different place today with more people changing climates, etc. Wolves do not take down Bison, cattle are non-native species. Why did God put wolves on the earth in the first place if it was mans destiny to eradicate them. Elk and Deer populations are in decline in other areas that have no wolves. Ranching is not sustainable, crony capitalism is at the root of this too.",1414454400,,613,4.738317757009346
8518430,5,B007JNX6WK,"A great DVD for those of us who love the scenery of Montana, and the stories of the people who live there.  However, this is not just a nature/reality movie.  Those who follow the Marxist/socialist/communist/liberal/progressive agenda may find some of its content offensive, so they would be wasting their money if they buy this DVD.  Since I grew up in the rural northeast (my grandfather had a diary farm), I identified with my common sense western cousins who are suffering under the burden of ""big government"" and its not so common sense programs.  In this case, it is about the re-introduction of wolves into a ranching/sport hunting area after this menace had been eradicated.  The economic impact has been disastrous.",1409443200,2,724,5.0
