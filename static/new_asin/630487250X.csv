7879419,5,630487250X,"Easily, one of Sylvester McCoy's best episodes as The Doctor!  Lots of references to the past and plenty of fun, and even Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Bessie shows up, for the last time.  One of the best written episodes in a very long time.  And if they hadn't wanted so much for the DVD, I would have bought it, rather than this VHS version.",1448323200,,347,4.476190476190476
7879420,2,630487250X,"Don't buy the DVD at 49.99 to 79.99  the vendor are pricing it way too high, it is worth $11.99 at best. I bought the VHS at $3.00 and it was only worth that much!",1401926400,,163,3.657142857142857
7879421,4,630487250X,"This story which is pretty good will be released on dvd in the uk in december 2008 , with a release elsewhere in 2009.  So wait to grab that when it gets here.",1229731200,,159,3.8181818181818183
7879422,2,630487250X,"In a word, this is a typical McCoy, cloudy plot, uninteresting characters, no rewatch value, and some ridiculous revelation about the Doctor being Merlin the Magician, once again tampering with the Doctor's background, or future-ground...  The only redeeming quality is the return of the Brigadier, the REAL ONE, not the forced-upon-us politically correct version, who by the way is horrible. If I hear her cry ""Oh Shame"" once more I'll...I'll...well, you get the picture.  Winifried Bambera is so nauseating in episode one, running around giving everyone orders, advancing on caves, yelling ""freeze""...  Luckily, the old school Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart arrives and usurps some of her authority, reducing her to merely running around dodging knights in shining armour, and not figuring as prominently as in the first episode.

As bad as the PC Brig was, she is not the worst character in Battlefield.  That distinction goes to Young Shoe or whatever her name was, by far the worst guest character and actress in Doctor Who history.  The phrase to best describe this character is utterly useless.  She had no bearing on the story, seemingly added simply to give little Ace someone to play with when she's not blowing things up. Speaking of Ace,  she gets my vote as the worst assistant ever.  The cliffhanger to episode two has her trapped in a tube filling with water.  It's the only time in Doctor Who I've ever hoped the companion gets killed. One irritating scene has the Brigadier telling Bambera to get Ace a blanket because she is drenched in water, a caring, chivalrous thing to do.  Yet, they look at him like he has the plague, still giving orders.  That scene alone shows how Doctor Who drastically changed for the worse during the McCoy years.  Even Young Shoe looks at the poor Brigadier and shakes her head.  How dare they mock a Doctor Who legend.  Rightfully, the show got cancelled after this season.

Admittedly, however, Jean Marsh as Morgraine is very commendable as a somewhat sympathetic villain.  One minute she is disintegrating a helpless UNIT soldier, but the very next she restores the sight of a blind woman.  She even leads a ceremony to pay homage to Britain's war casualties. Ms. Marsh is very old school Doctor Who, and it shows.

Speaking of UNIT, this story displays PC at its most gut-wrenching. Check out all the nationalities represented by UNIT soldiers, Russian, French, etc.  Why?  Do we really need to go there?  As the Brigadier asks one of the soldiers, ""You're not English, are you?""

On a final positive note, one of the very few positives in this sea of misery, we finally get to see Doris, the Brigadier's wife, who was referred to in The Daemons, a real classic story.  Only watch this one for the return of Alistaire Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart.  The scenes of him and Doris are by far the best in the story.",1183766400,,2858,4.855371900826446
7879423,4,630487250X,"The Doctor as Merlin?  Well, that's what he's called by Ancelyn ap Gwalchmai, Knight General of the Britons from an Earth where magic is more prevalent over technology.  If the Doctor doesn't do something, the ""Earth could be in the center of a war that doesn't belong in this dimension.""  That is a war fought between forces loyal to Arthur and those loyal to Morgaine of the Fay, Battle Queen of the S'Rax and her son Mordred.
Nearby, are two other parties who become involved in this war.  The first is Peter Warmsley and Shou Yuing, archaeologists working on a dig sponsored by the Carbury Trust.  Warmsley's a dedicated archaeologist, believing that ""history has to be eased out of the Earth one painstaking layer at a time.""  After ten years, he has unearthed the scabbard belonging to Excalibur, but where is the sword?
The other party is UNIT, led by Brigadier Winifred Bambera, who is supervising a convoy carrying a nuclear missile.  For the first time, we see UNIT for what it's supposed to be, as soldiers from Russia, Czech Republic, and France are seen.  However, as the Russian Zbrigniev tells Bambera, ""whenever this Doctor shows up, all hell breaks loose.""  And when the Doctor shows up at this time, Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart has to redon the uniform, take the baton and service issue revolver, and become reunited with his friend and former scientific advisor.  Nicholas Courtney's (Lethbridge-Stewart) a familiar and welcome presence in Who, and this show succeeds mostly due to him.
As UNIT shows up, this does reinforce series continuity, as past monsters are mentioned, and a certain yellow Roadster makes a welcome final appearance, though Ace and Shou Yuing's mockery of it--""zero to sixty in twenty minutes"" is short-lived.
There are few moments in Who that are embarrassingly cringing, and unfortunately, this story suffers from it in Episode 2, when Mordred, in summoning his mother, goes over the top with some demonic laughter.  Whenever I see this segment, I look for something soft to throw at the TV screen.  And the concept of the more magical Earth isn't surprising, as the Doctor says the reverse of Arthur C. Clarke's law, ""Any advanced from of technology is indistinguishable from magic"" is applicable.
Jean Marsh's portrayal of Morgaine makes her a complex villain.  Resplendent in battle armour and crown, she clearly believes in an honourable war--""what is victory without honour?""--at one point scolding her son for fighting on Earth without first paying their respects to Earth's fallen soldiers.  Her conversation with the Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart is one of fellow foes showing mutual respect.  She tells him calmly that she bears him no malice, but at their next meeting, she will kill him.
The Destroyer, which apart from its bluish skin, is a dead ringer for the Devil in the Tom Cruise movie Legend, is an example of animatronics operating the jaws and saliva dripping from its mouth.  And its description by Morgaine, ""Lord of Darkness, Eater of Worlds,"" is a reference to Robert Oppenheimer quoting from the Bhagavad-Gita:  ""I am become death, the shatterer of worlds; waiting that hour that ripens to their doom.""  And guess when Oppenheimer quoted that?
Which leads to the metaphor of the Destroyer and nuclear war.  The Doctor's horrific description:  ""All over the worlds, fools are poised, ready to let death fly machines of death...of light brighter than the sun.  Not a war between armies, nor a war between nations, but death, death gone mad.  A child looks up in the sky, his eyes turn to cinders, no not tears, only ashes.  Is this honour?  Is this war?""
Part Arthurian legend, UNIT action story, Battlefield does waver a bit unevenly into comedic moments when such moments aren't called for, but prevails with a strong story, characters, and a never to be forgotten theme.",1080000000,5,3846,4.992163009404389
7879424,4,630487250X,"Not the greatest Who storyline, but one of my favorites. That could be my love of Arthuriana and the fact that this is one of the weirdest twists on the Matter of Britain I've ever seen!",996710400,,186,4.194444444444445
7879425,3,630487250X,"A book I read recently told me something which didn't come as a great surprise - that 'Battlefield' was originally a 3-part story.
It's true that it starts off very promisingly.  There are Arthurian knights, the  Brigadier is called out of retirement and we are presented with a host of  interesting characters.  But after a while it all falls apart - the  characters disappear into the background and are replaced by one padded  chase scene and action sequence after another.  And didn't I hear the Jon  Pertwee and Tom Baker doctors condemning the possibility of magic?  So why  all of a sudden is McCoy's doctor battling wicked witches?
What stands  out from the naff special effects, unconvincing fight scenes and bland,  feeble music in this story is the Destroyer, a superb creation which is  unfortunately wasted in a minor role.  And Morgaine is a well-acted and  complex character who destroys a helicopter and reduces a soldier to ashes,  and yet restores a pub landlord's wife's eyesight as payment for some  drinks.  She is also ultimately not unsympathetic.  So it seems a shame  there isn't a stronger plot to do the character justice.",958003200,4,1149,4.885416666666667
7879426,5,630487250X,"I had heard a lot of bad things about Battlefield.  Fortunately, they were all wrong.
Battlefield is a very light, fluffy Doctor Who adventure.  It isn't as much 'Who for 9 year olds', as someone claimed.  The writer tries  to have a bit of fun with the characters, and in doing so makes a  interesting, and even sometimes dark, story.
So ignore those nay-sayers.  Battlefield is a treat.",956448000,4,388,4.632352941176471
7879427,5,630487250X,"That the Doctor will, in his personal future, be the renowned Merlin of Arthurian legend, is the premise of this episode of the beloved and long-running science fiction series.
The first time I saw ""Battlefield"" was while sitting cross-legged on a hotel room floor with members of the ""Legion of Rassilon"" during a science fiction convention. Fast-forward five, maybe 10 years later, and in my second viewing the story lost none of its campy charm. By this time, I was more familiar with the Doctor and his universe, and so, while the story was still just as fresh, I found more to appreciate.
When the Doctor shows up near an archaeological site (and a UNIT exercise) near Lake Vortigern, all hell is sure to break loose, and Sylvester McCoy doesn't disappoint. Bring Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart out of retirement to clash with a younger, female brigadier named Winnifred Bambera and throw in Morgaine and her knights for good measure, and the producers of Doctor Who created a sure winner.
Bambera is an intriguing character who deserved to be brought back in future episodes -- alas, her appearance was late in the show's life.
What can I say about the elder Brigadier, except that he is one of my favorite characters. He is also a character who has weathered the series, from his blood 'n' thunder days with Jon Pertwee to the more reflective man we see coming out of retirement to face one last threat.
The acting is campy, but with great lines of wry, catchy and quotable dialogue. Yes, the special effects are low-budget, but that has always been part of the Doctor's appeal. This episode combines its science fiction and medieval elements skillfully, with well-placed humor. One of my personal favorite episodes, I am sure that I will view ""Battlefield"" again and again. I am also sure that I will find something new to apprecate each time.",956188800,4,1849,4.83596214511041
