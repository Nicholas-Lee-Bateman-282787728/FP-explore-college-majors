7537061,5,B017Y0HMKO,"Wow what a fantastic movie. I can't understand why it has received so few reviews but it did come out very recently. Maybe like it's hero it is just a true underdog. As a total sports movie buff, I can say My All American is equally as inspirational as any of the best sports movies out there. And what's more it's true. It's a great movie about a great man and great athlete you've never heard of. Well worth your time!! Wish there were more like this out there.",1456444800,15,463,4.213483146067416
7537062,5,B017Y0HMKO,"How is such a wonderfully made movie like this not box office gold?
Gripping, fantastic acting, writing and directing. This has the winning trifecta. I have seen every sports movie ever made, and this small film just made one of my top three.",1456358400,,242,4.651162790697675
7537063,3,B017Y0HMKO,"We would not have been national champions if you had not been on that field. Freddie Steinmark (Wittrock) is a tremendous football player, but was always told he was too small to play for a major college. When Texas coach Darrell Royal (Eckhart) recruits him, Freddie works harder than anyone on the team and finally earns a starting job. In the midst of a run at the National Championship season Freddie's knee begins to bother him. When he sees the doctor his life, and the legacy of Texas football is changed forever. I am a huge fan of sports movies, especially ones that are true. This one took awhile for me to get invested in, but when I did I really got into it. This is not one of the best sports movies I have ever seen, but it is very much worth seeing and I do highly recommend it. The movie has great sports scenes as well as a very emotional arc that can only be true, this isn't something you can make up. Sports movie fans will really like this, and this is actually a decent family movie. It is rated PG, but some of the subject matter may need to be explained. Overall, a very good movie that I recommend. Not one of the best sports movies ever made, but a very good addition to the genre. I give this a high B.",1456099200,2,1229,4.211864406779661
7537064,5,B017Y0HMKO,"This is a film about family, faith and football. Every team should watch it to see what it is to be a ""team player"". It's very heart warming and truly close to the actual story. It's a film every family should have in their personal movie collection.",1456012800,6,250,4.340425531914893
7537065,3,B017Y0HMKO,"My All American is based on the true story of Freddie Steinmark (Finn Wittrock, TVs American Horror Story), a Colorado high school football star who compensated for his small size by playing harder than practically anyone. He won a scholarship to University of Texas, Austin, where he helped lead the Longhorns to the championship in 1969.

Freddie is a good kid brought up in a traditional two-parent household who attends Catholic mass and strives to improve his grades in school. His story is bookended by Darrel Royal (Aaron Eckhart), who presided over the team throughout the 60s and most of the 70s. In heavy old-age make-up, Eckharts Royal is giving a post-career interview to a young journalist. Through flashbacks, we see how talent and a driving desire to win spurred  Freddie to succeed despite being undersized. This caught the attention of Royal who offered the high school senior a full scholarship to the University.

Director Angelo Pizzo is no stranger to sports-themed movies. He also directed Hoosiers and Rudy. My All American follows a similar dramatic arc to that in Rudy, so theres a sense that weve seen this story before. There is more to Freddie than football, and his personal off-the-field story is supposedly the films dramatic hook. However, the films focus is skewed toward the scenes of him on the field, showing his resolve and dedication. Less of this, and more of his personal story would have improved the picture and involved us more. Freddie is characterized by mostly by movie cliches and his story never achieves the emotional impact intended. Football lovers will undoubtedly appreciate the recreated game moments, but general audiences will find My All American rather flat and sappy.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include background on the real Freddie Steinmark and a behind-the-scenes, making-of featurette.",1455926400,2,1866,5.148514851485149

Great cast, and a very good depiction of the era, when styles and social mores were changing rapidly.  Kudos to the art department staff!",1447459200,15,300,4.862745098039215
7537068,5,B017Y0HMKO,"(A possible ""spoiler"" is included, but this may or may not matter to you since it's a true story:)

Sports movies have a limited number of themes they can explore, but there's always room for a different angle on a theme or a new flavor/style. My All-American takes place in the late 1960s and follows the brief college football career of Freddie Steinmark, whose optimism and moral decency, rooted in his dad and Catholicism, enabled him to succeed and then face declining health with bravery. It is not edgy or groundbreaking in any way, but it is enjoyable entertainment and has really nice casting, in my opinion. It shows a person who is untainted by the counterculture of the 1960s, and whom everyone respects, and who faces his decline with the same determined courage with which he faced the challenges of the sport. Some of the scenes were filmed at the University of Texas which Steinmark had played at. I think its flavor is a lot like the Gary Cooper movie about Lou Gehrig, The Pride of the Yankees, because of the overall innocence of the characters and how relationships develop only to lead to declining health. It's done in a way that didn't make me feel sad at the end, though. I wasn't alive in the 60s, but the movie almost has an element of nostalgia about the era, even as it acknowledges the upheaval of it. It's a nice human interest story with wholesome characters. Mainstream critics are too critical overall of biographical movies which are presented in as straightforward a way as this. For my part, I think it's a fun movie to watch even though football maneuvers don't make sense to me, and I feel that the fairly straightforward personality and life of Freddie somehow make a fine motion picture even though there's not much of a dramatic arc (drastic changes to his character). Besides his optimism, courtesy, and determination, I think the thing we are supposed to admire about his character is that he was determined to enjoy his life even after he learned he wouldn't live much longer (due to bone cancer). He maintained a sense of purpose to the end.",1447372800,39,2086,4.683923705722071

My only beef with this movie is that I am a Wheat Ridge High School alum, and I am very sad that they didn't film the Wheat Ridge portion in Colorado. The landscape they show in the movie isn't even remotely close to West Denver/Wheat Ridge then or now. I know that the focus was on Freddie's time at Texas, but it would have been nice if the production did a bit more research on Wheat Ridge High School and the West Denver/Boulder area in general. The only thing they got right was the Farmer logo that you saw in a few glimpses.

The scene on the hill where he points out areas along the front range almost made me throw my remote through the television, you can't see Boulder from a small hill overlooking Denver even now.",1475452800,3,992,4.243386243386244

I just hope the story is completely factual. Hollywood has a way of interjecting crap into true stories. I recently watched the 1969 Texas-Arkansas shoot-out on YouTube and they did a great job re-creating parts of that game. Although I didn't see Freddie limping around like in the movie. But you see him come out of the game in the 4th quarter. I thought Aston Eckhart was an odd choice to play Darrell Royal, they look nothing alike. But he did a fine job in the role. The actors who.played Freddie and his girl friend were great choices, a strong physical resemblence for both.

7537215,3,B017Y0HMKO,"A lot of attention was paid to detail.  It laid out his character and the events nicely.  He was a good person, a good athlete who was struck down by a debilitating illness.  And while it demonstrated over and over again the strength of his character, it never took us into his mind or those close to him to see how he coped with it, came to grips with the illness and imminent death over time.  I kept looking for it, but it never showed up.  That scene like from the Brian Piccolo story, where he made peace with it and from it you learned a little how you might find peace in a similar circumstance.

Matt Damon would have been much better cast as Royal, but overall it doesn't really matter.  The movie was about Steinmark, not Royal.  Most people won't remember Royal or his drawl or that little smile that pretty much always was in his voice.",1468972800,2,848,4.289308176100629

I love stories about people who are positive, ""get-it-done"" kinda personalities who don't complain but just push forward. The main character, Freddie, was a hard-working kid who earned himself a college scholarship even though he was on the small side.  The coach was equally inspirational since he looked past size (what everyone else was inspecting) and looked at the individual and the contributions he could make. Good lesson on not judging a book by its cover. This player takes the team to the national football championship and is supportive of his teammates and respective of his family. He became an example to everyone around him through his hard work and good temperament. I really loved this movie!",1465171200,3,770,5.015625

7537324,4,B017Y0HMKO,"Although this tends to follow a tried and true familiar formula, this movie really has an inspirational story that alone makes it worth watching.  Since this does have the same writer as Hoosiers and Rudy, it makes sense that this has the same kind of feel good story as those movies.  I wasn't so familiar with the Steinbeck story but prior to watching did a bit of research to see what this true story movie was based.  Finn Wittrock, who I was not really familiar with as an actor, did a good job in the role at playing the clean cut, never quit Steinbeck.  Set in the 60s, the producers really did a good job at giving the nostalgic feel of the time period in which this is played.  This, to me, is a really good family movie that doesnt get preachy but at the same time is a good inspirational story.  Being a football player, there are quite a few game scenes but that really doesnt detract from the main story of Steinbecks character and his courage as he face the odds that he had against him throughout his life. This movie is inspiration and definitely a tear jerker as well but a bit tragic in the same sense as well.  The story does a great job at making you care about the likeable Steinbeck.  Even though it follows in the footsteps of other great sports movies, there is nothing better than a story that inspires and makes you feel something at the end.  This movie definitely does that.

7537403,5,B017Y0HMKO,"Thank you Anthem Productions for sending us this Blu-Ray to review!

My All American is based off of the book Courage Beyond the Game: The Freddie Steinmark Story written by Jim Dent.  Both the book and movie are based on a true story about a young man who lived for playing football.  Freddie wasn't very tall for a football player, measuring in at 5 9, and as a result not many colleges responded to his applications for scholarships.  Some of his taller friends had no trouble hearing back from prestigious colleges.  Freddie compensated for his height with speed and strength and was a very talented safety.

His high school coach saw his potential and worked him pretty hard.  After schools training, Freddies father worked him even harder!  Freddie was very disciplined physically, academically, and spiritually by praying and attending mass daily.  Due to financial constraints Freddies family was relying on his football skills to land him a scholarship to pay for his college tuition.  Despite the lack of responses from colleges, Freddie and his family did not give up.

Freddies high school coach put in a good word for him and one of his taller friends to University of Texas coach Royal.  Freddie was finally given a scholarship and a chance to show his prowess on the field.  Instead of taking the credit, Freddie said it was an answered prayer.  Getting the scholarship was half the battle, maintaining it is even harder.  Freddie survived the cuts that weeded out half of the prospective players.

Despite having some leg pain, Freddie didn't let it stop him from achieving his goals.  His dedication and skills set him apart on the field and his efforts made the 1969 Texas Longhorns national champions.  Once they won the Game of the Century that was attended by Richard Nixon, Freddie got his leg examined by a doctor and the diagnosis was startling.

I won't be spoiling the end of this one hour and fifty-nine minute movie for you.  I will however highly recommend it while cautioning that its probably not suitable for younger children and earns its PG rating.  There is language from the coaches as they give the team pep talks.

I thought the football uniforms were a pretty decent representation of the times, but they should have paid more attention to detail.

The main character is Freddie and you get to see how hard he works from the moment he was a little kid all the way to college. His character and awesome likable attitude is addicting and you soon become his best fan watching.

The ending is sad but it's a true story and makes you appreciate the heart and spirit Freddie lived his whole life. I would rank this up there with Rudy minus the sad ending. It makes you appreciate life because none of us know how much time we have to live. Life can be taken away no matter how good a person you are or how old you are.
