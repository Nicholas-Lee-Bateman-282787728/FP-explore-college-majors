4511499,3,B00505E538,"The premise here is that stones can be used to gain possession of a person's soul.  This is shown via five free-thinkers (including two of the girls on the cover) who descend on an abandoned estate in Britain intent on conjuring spirits.  It appears they've come to the right place when a local photographer informs them ""this is one of the most haunted places in England.""

The clothing and attitude is 60s, and much of the movie is brooding music accompanying brooding images.  Only occasionally does the film break the spell by not taking itself so seriously, which I appreciated.

So it's ""hippies suffer the Blair Witch Project on a Masterpiece Theatre location,"" which means it's a very different sort of film at first, not quite fiction and not exactly a mood-piece and certainly not a documentary either.  But if you're patient, The Stone turns into a solid horror film, very scary and fun to watch.

The abandoned estate is the big star, and it's appropriately creepy and magnificent at the same time.  The gang is visiting to ""assist lost souls in moving to the next realm,"" but of course they have no idea what they're dealing with, and are soon in over their heads.  And it shouldn't be any surprise that the spirits of the dead are none too grateful for the help.

All in all, a decent horror movie made in an interesting way, with a couple of really good scares on the journey, (so don't let your guard down).",1313712000,,1423,4.611111111111111

4511502,1,B00505E538,"This film was burdened by too much style that buried the story. While it concentrated on camera angles and a brooding atmosphere, it lost in telling the story. It just becomes a stylized mess that one can't possibly follow or understand what is happening.

Often, the camera is filming the cast from a distance or from behind trees. You can see them moving about and doing things, but you can't see exactly what they are doing.  Although the soundtrack is fitting, the audio for the speaking parts is poor.

I would rather spend my time watching a good, creepy movie I can understand instead of over-stylized junk.",1385942400,2,614,4.719626168224299
4511503,5,B00505E538,I love a good horror movie and this fit the bill nicely. The backdrop is a big English house that is pretty creepy. I'll be watching this again with some friends soon. Scary.,1384041600,,174,4.303030303030303

4511509,3,B00505E538,"I love horror movies of all types. I don't care if it's low budget or Hollywood budget. The Stone had an interesting story line where each person was forced to face their inner demons. Humans have some pretty ugly stuff inside them and can be afraid of just about anything. Remember the Stay Puft Marshmallow man in Ghost Busters? In The Stone there isn't anything as silly as that and as the story picks up it grows more intense. The hard music that shows up during the film is something I've come to expect from Philip Gardiner films. Everyone has their unique creative ""fingerprint"" and this is just one of his. If I saw one of his films without it I'd probably be disappointed!",1314489600,,681,4.5

8450705,1,B00505E538,"Like wow. After watching several thousand movies, I thought they all had one thing in common,a plot.  I'm no director, but I have to suspect the lack of one was the weakness of this movie.  Why else would the first 20 minutes of this movie consist of 5 people walking on a trail (shot from multiple angles), a van driving up a road to an abandoned house( shot from multiple angles) and a van backing up into said house( shot from multiple angles). From there on, the action got more intense. There was several minutes of unloading the van, and setting up three tents. This too was shot from several different angles, and included  filming of a man filming the unloading.  The rest of the movie included playing ""ring around the rosie,"" sometimes actually moving, but mostly just holding hands. There was lots of walking, sometimes with clever cinematic tricks included, eg. superimposing another figure in the scene. And then there was walking. The producer must have gotten a good deal that day to rent the run down manor house, because 95% of the movie was shot there.",1466812800,5,1070,4.675531914893617
8450706,1,B00505E538,"Yet another Philip Gardiner helmed exercise in tedium, repetition, bad acting, foolishness, and film-school-101 camera/editing tricks. And, if that wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack, when not generic horror movie fare, consists of one innocuous pop/rock song after another. You've been warned.",1456531200,,293,6.170731707317073

8450709,1,B00505E538,"This was a painful movie to watch. The bulk of the film is more like a series of cheesy montage-style music videos than a narrative. There's barely a hint of a plot for the first half of the movie, the visual storytelling is plodding, repetitive, and amateurish, and nothing happens that I'd call scary or suspenseful. In fact, so much nothing happens that if one were to edit out all the padding, the movie's running time would barely add up to a full hour. It fails as horror, it fails as indie cinema, it fails as entertainment.",1454803200,,531,4.484536082474227
