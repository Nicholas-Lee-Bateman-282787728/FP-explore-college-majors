8565369,2,B00BBFP5VC,"Four DC drug dealers are offered an opportunity to make extra money selling body parts through a mortician. The film uses this for the title but the film was over powered by the personal dramas in the lives and girlfriends making the trafficking secondary. There is also a badly developed subplot of two police officers with no character who are on to them. The big drama is that Theo (Walter Maxfield Jones) used to date Diamond (Tonya Sol Lumpkin) who is now married to his ""brother: Kwan (Che Evans) and he wants to get her back to the dismay of his wife.

This is the typical bad acting, heavy dialouge, low action, low budget African-American thug film. The main difference is the location and the addition of the body trafficking. There are films with 50 Cent that are better.

 Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1386374400,,826,4.6438356164383565
