Blu-ray Video Quality  The Blu :: elements project: 'forsenses' is brought to you with an awesome stunning 1080p image transfer, that will make you feel you have a 4K image transfer and equally stunning is the 1.78: 1 aspect ratio, to make it look spectacular and totally amazing. All image photos were taken with a trained eye and the highest technical requirements. And that can be seen. Never before there was footage of floating whales, lava flows, mountain ridges, or recorded in extreme slow motion scenes of rain on a daisy in this perfection. The colours are so luminous intensity of and do not form seams despite its enormous saturation rate neighbouring patches. The contrast is different in filmy shades so that even different temperature layers of water are mapped clearly separable. Compression is also at the highest level and provides an ultra-smooth and exceptionally stable image.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The soundtrack is very versatile and at times you get to experience really nice classic type pop music that has very catchy rhythms and the singers you hear are like angelic voices, especially with track 06. Macroscopy: Splashing H2O. The 5.1 and 7.1-channels are clean and separated from each speaker to ensure that every sound, every note is exactly heard from the direction from which it is intended. It is a fundamental listening experience in large space width and depth of space. The headphone-surround track has a simple transitional special 3D viewing experience with sounds from up to 12.1 channel mixes, plus subwoofer. For the first time you also get sounds from the ceiling. Anyone who has a pair of headphones should definitely try it in a quiet hour, because you will experience a total 3D Binaural recording sound field. And for those who do not know what a Binaural recording is, here is the definition: Binaural recording is a method of recording sound that uses two microphones, arranged with the intent to create a 3D stereo sound sensation for the listener of actually being in the room with the performers or instruments. This effect is often created using a technique known as ""dummy head recording"" and wherein a mannequin head is outfitted with a microphone in each ear. Binaural recording is intended for replay using headphones and will not translate properly over stereo speakers. This idea of a three dimensional or ""internal"" form of sound has also translated into useful advancement of technology in many things such as stethoscopes creating ""in-head"" acoustics and IMAX films being able to create a three dimensional acoustic experience. Once recorded, the binaural effect can be reproduced using stereo headphones. It does not work with mono playback; nor does it work while using loudspeaker units, as the acoustics of this arrangement distort the channel separation via natural crosstalk, an approximation can be obtained if the listening environment is carefully designed by employing expensive crosstalk cancellation equipment. The result is a listening experience that spatially transcends normally recorded stereo, since it accurately reproduces the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360 nature of how human ears pick up nuance in the sound waves. Binaural recordings can very convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead, above, or wherever else the sound actually came from during recording. The Binaural recording sounds you experience are truly amazing and totally awe inspiring.

The segment with the whales is in water so clear and blue you would think you were there.  The waterfall segment is visually impressive as well.  The audio is fine I suppose but some segments could have had a more catchy song or more upbeat.
