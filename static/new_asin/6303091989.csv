554125,5,6303091989,"I first saw the ( I believe ) uncut version translated in German in 1975. The movie had such an impact on me that I mesured all other Sherlock Holmes movies and stories with this one. Indeed, there is not a minute of boring scenes, and I must admit I just love the cultivated language they use in the German translation. It is not only a funny, slightly horrifying ( after all Sherlock Holmes does open a grave ) and thrilling story in a beautiful setting, it is also the most touching story between two characters who respect each other for what they are. In a sequence of about three seconds, Robert Stephens is able to show all of Holmes' feelings : how much he's hurt to have been used, his admiration for that woman who was able to fool HIM, and the dispair to have to part so soon. Holmes is bound to be right when he sais that women are not to be trusted and unreliable. First his client is not what he thought, and then she promises to see him again but gets shot before she can.
All of this is framed with the passionate soundtrack of Miklos Rozsa, which, unfortunately, seems impossible to get on CD, the way it's composed in the movie.
What beats me, though, is the fact that this is not a well known movie. It certainly deserves better !",1018310400,9,1249,4.274261603375527
554126,5,6303091989,"Leave it to the great Billy Wilder to try and make the definitive Sherlock Holmes movie.  I think he succeeded admirably.  The touches of humor combined with the action and drama are just the right blend.  My only complaint is that I know Wilder intended to make a much longer, more in-depth film.  I hope the film studio can find the lost footage and get it out on DVD.",1008547200,2,370,4.318840579710145
554127,5,6303091989,"The Case of Sherlock Holmes appropriately begins with a case, containing all the familiar signifiers of the great detective.  Wilder takes the mythic, universal Holmes, and returns him to his origins in the fin de siecle 1880s and 90s, the period of Messrs. Jekyll, Hyde and Gray.  Like these, and most Wilde heroes, Holmes is a split personality, damagingly torn between the obligationss of his reputation, and his personal desires.  His inability to be a man, a desiring body, turns him into a ghost, present in the world of men, but unable to partake of it.  The opening of the case containing Holmes is mirrored by the later opening of a coffin, containing the man Holmes is impersonating.
Played like a Wildean tragicomedy, the film also shows, in this celebration of the archetypal reasoner, the roots of the 20th century's barbarous anti-reason - the Boer War victims, Mycroft's scientific militarism, and the burial of the midgets all point to the two World Wars and concentration camps to come.",985132800,3,1003,4.9523809523809526
554128,5,6303091989,"If I were to be stranded on a deserted island and came upon a magic lamp, naturally I'd rub it three times and a genie would come out (of course).  He'd tell me he'd grant any three wishes.  Undoubtably, one of those wishes would be for MGM/UA to release The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes the way Billy Wilder wanted it to be seen...in DVD format, too, no less.
It's that *good*.  The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is by far the ""meatiest"" of Wilder's films, Sunset Boulevard and Lost Weekend included.  It's not another one of those movies that take a famous literary character and disregard everything the original author wrote.  This film gets in there where the rubber meats the road.  Sherlock Holmes, psychoanalyzed for all the world to see what exactly made him the man he was.

554129,5,6303091989,"Why a mess like IRMA LA DOUCE makes a profit and a lovely film like this sinks without a trace is a mystery bigger than anything on display in this ""lost"" case of Sherlock Holmes, which involves the Truth About  The Loch Ness Monster, some very sinister monks, and a lovely woman  (Genvieve Page) who drags Holmes into the middle of it all (Well, she does  show up on his doorstep stark naked in the middle of night.  What's a  gentleman, even one who's a bit of a misogynist, supposed to do?).  Robert  Stephens brings wit, melancholy, and anger to the role, keeping all of  these elements of Holmes' personality at play simultaneously, and he is  matched splendidly by Colin Blakely's Dr. Watson, who's smarter than Nigel  Bruce's Watson and more fun than Conan Doyle's.  Page is poised, charming,  and ambiguous as the heroine, just the sort of girl to hold Holme's  interest.  There's also a wonderful supporting performance by Christopher  Lee as Holmes' brother Mycroft, a sputtering mixture of affection and  aggravation for his impetuous younger brother.  And all of this is played  against the backround of a splendid score by Miklos Rosza, adapted from his  Second Violin Concerto (even if you don't like the movie, try and get a  recording of the music).  Just when movies like KISS ME, STUPID and THE  FORTUNE COOKIE make you wonder if Wilder ever knew what he was doing, along  comes a film like this, which reminds you that yes, he knew EXACTLY what he  was doing--some of the time, at any rate . . .",957312000,52,1514,4.6477272727272725
554130,5,6303091989,"Absolutely wonderful movie from Billy Wilder shows us a case of Holmes' that was never revealed by his friend and biographer, Dr. Watson, because of the its personal nature.  What makes this film work so well are the  relationships.  Particularly, the relationship between Holmes and his  Belgium client who has come to him seeking her missing husband.  Complex  story deals with Holmes' obsession with the art of deduction, his misogyny,  his drug addiction, and his relationship with Watson without ever  forgetting to tell an interesting mystery.  This film is both humorous and  melancholy, and it is an all around great cinematic experince by one of  hollywoods great directors, punctuated with fine performances.  It is truly  an overlooked classic.",954460800,7,755,5.296610169491525
554131,4,6303091989,"Being a Sherlock Holmes fan (I'd rather say expert!), I really enjoyed this movie, although I did not appreciate the character of Watson, presented as funny and not intelligent, which is not true (remember, he is  the one who narrated the Sherlock Holmes stories). The main idea of the  movie is interesting: was Holmes a homosexual? why was he that much  doubtful about women? was he ever in love? The plot is also very  attractive: for the first time in his career, Holmes would fail to fully  use his computer-brain, because, and for the first time in his career, his  feelings will be guiding him, although the mystery seems easy to resolve  for a mind like his, and this is proved by the intervention of his brother,  Mycroft. Robert Stephens perfectly incarnates the role of Sherlock Holmes,  much better than Basil Rathbone (but still very far from the excellent  Jeremy Brett). Melancholy, romance, mystery and suspense: a very nice  combination. See this movie even if you know nothing about Sherlock Holmes.  You will just love it.",943920000,5,1041,4.8522727272727275

554365,2,6303091989,"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 1970 film

The copyright for Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional characters expired before this film was produced so anyone can appropriate his characters today. None who do this are as good as the original four long stories and fifty-six short stories (which reflect life in those passed times). This parody is not as good as the low-budget movies of the 1930s and 1940s. The part spent at the opera can be omitted without affecting the rest of this story. It applies an outlook that did not exist then, and denies these stories about the beginnings of criminalistics and their effect upon later fiction. We know people in show business do not lead normal lives. Those who pretend to be characters on stage may suffer psychic damage and seek drink or drugs in relief. The first false note is showing a dusty manuscript. If it was kept in a sealed box where did that dust come from?

In August 1887 Holmes and Watson return to London. There is some comic situations. Holmes complains about a lack of action (and fees), and reaches for his small bottle. They receive an invitation to an opera; this is followed by some ""funny"" skits. It does show how gossip is spread by the expressions on faces. People believe what they want to believe when it belittles someone else. That is the appeal of gossip. [""Thou shalt not bear false witness.""] ""Goodnight, Watson."" The doorbell rings, a young lady is brought in. They accept delivery of this package. ""I don't know."" Who is Gabrielle? Holmes traced her luggage ticket and found her name and valise. Her husband is missing! Holmes sends a letter to 32 Ashdown Street, an empty shop. Who will take the letter? Who is buying a dozen canaries? Mycroft tells Sherlock to drop his investigation. [Official Secrets?] Holmes has a plan to drop any tail. Why does Gabrielle open her parasol indoors? [Bad luck?] They travel to Inverness in Scotland. A picnic in a cemetery? Did Watson see a monster in a lake? There are mysterious events. What are Trappist monks doing in Protestant Scotland? They travel around the country lanes on bicycles. [The great bicycle craze of the 1880s inspired the invention of the automobile.] They visit a castle undergoing restoration; it is closed to the public.

On the lake Holmes hears the rattle of machinery. [Sound carries farther in water.] Their boat is upset, yet they all survive in that cold water. Holmes speculates about a mechanical monster. Where will they go next? Mycroft visits Sherlock and talks about ""submersibles"". Madame Valladon is really an agent of Wilhelmstrasse! [The street in Berlin where the German Secret Service is headquartered.] Queen Victoria arrives after dark to view the `Jonah'. That craft is not sporting and un-English. Would her grandson Willie ever bomb London? [Yes.] This project is cancelled, but Mycroft has a plan to let no crisis go to waste. Fraulein von Hofmann-Stahl is awakened. ""Unter den Schloss?"" She will be useful in a trade. And so the story ends. ""Auf wiedersehn."" Later a letter reaches Sherlock in London with sad news about Ilse. The Kempei-Tai are not easily fooled. Sherlock reaches for his little bottle.

It seems that writers without great talent will try to tear down a fictional character because they cannot produce a better product. There were ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies in the 1930s and 1940s, and a TV series in the 1950s. Tastes and expectations change. Hammett, Gardner, and Chandler were popular in the past but are no longer being published. Nowadays people watch television, but you learn little (compared to the novels of Hammett or Gardner).",1459987200,,3621,4.902120717781403

554593,5,6303091989,"Billy Wilder's film has had a checkered history and unfortunately we will never be able to see it in its entirety and be able to judge what the director's intended vision of his project might have been.  Personally I am quite happy with the abbreviated version; I think a three hour plus movie would have been far too long but at least it would have been nice to have been able to make that judgment. We do get to see some of the missing footage in the extras section of the DVD (see end of review).
In its current form this is still a fine film with Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond (with alleged help from George Axelrod and John Mortimer) creating a clever and engaging story with enough colorful characters which is very much in the Arthur Conan Doyle spirit (no pun intended!). Robert Stephens makes an adequate Sherlock Holmes although it has been criticized for being too effeminate. The ""Sherlock Holmes Journal"" described ""Stephens' appearance is tolerably acceptable but reflects a namby-pamby of voice that is wholly and irritatingly wrong"". On the other hand most critics liked Colin Blakely's comic turn as Dr. Watson. As a Sherlock purist I've never been too enthused about Watson being  portrayed as a buffoon.
To me the best things about this movie which persuades me to give it such a high rating are the superb technical aspects on display.  The period setting is exemplary with Wilder capturing the era perfectly, helped by the extraordinary production design by the renowned Alexander Trauner, although most of the costly exterior sets were seldom featured in the completed film. The Baker Street rooms were so perfectly recreated that Adrian Conan Doyle felt that Holmes would not have noticed a thing out of place.  Cinematographer Christopher Challis has beautifully captured the interiors and the beautiful Scottish countryside. And best of all, this film has one of the great film scores by one of the all-time great composers : Miklos Rozsa.  Nothing new to expect a magnificent score from Rozsa but this one which he recycled from his 1953 violin concerto with added new material is simply glorious. It fits this film perfectly and lifts it to a new level of excellence.  And yes, that is Dr. Rozsa seen early in the film in a cameo conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra during the ballet sequence.
As a footnote, this beautiful score, long unavailable, has popped up recently in special collector's editions. The original ""archival edition"" running 66:23 was released by Quartet Records in a very limited edition.  Also Tadlow Music has a reconstructed complete score performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, running 77:50, including some music written for the film but not in the final cut.  Both are marvellous recordings. I have both and treasure each and as with all Rozsa music, the more the better.
There are quite a number of special features on this DVD release. Included are a rather odd featurette with Christopher Lee who played Mycroft Holmes. A more interesting extra is an extensive interview (nearly 30 minutes) with film editor Ernest Walter who provides a lot of insight into the film's missing parts and working with Mr. Wilder. And running about 50 minutes, is a reconstructed prologue using script pages and stills and film of the missing sequence ""The Naked Honeymooners"" without dialog.",1409097600,8,3350,4.959001782531194

554597,2,6303091989,"I finally got around to watching this movie tonight.  It's been a couple years since I last watched the old MGM DVD release which I still have and afterwords I did a quick bit of comparison between the two.

Like many have already expressed, the new BD is a disappointment.  It *does* look marginally better than the old DVD, especially because it's not as overall bright as the DVD (although that varies in many spots between the DVD and BD) and is a bit clearer despite the way it was filmed (very soft and defused), but it exhibits a distracting pinkish tone especially early on and yes, there's numerous dirt, scratches, etc sporadically throughout, especially noticeable during the (day for night) outdoor coach scene 2/3rds through the movie.  The beginning when the box of Holmes' artifacts is being opened with the credits, there's noticeable gate weave going on.  Oddly, it appears a different source may have been used vs the old DVD at least for several reels of this transfer as there was little of the blems on the DVD that are seen on this BD.  Finally, the encoding doesn't do this transfer any favors, it often looks too compressed.

Bonus features include interviews and ""deleted scenes"" which are mostly reconstructed from stills, images of the script and dialog only.  Whoever threw together the bonus feature of the ""Alternate Ending"" should be embarrassed.  A single out of context publicity still is onscreen instead of the footage present in over about 5 minutes worth of dialog from the same scene in the actual movie!

The movie itself kind of drags in places but it's more of a character study that rewards the viewer in bits and pieces over the long haul. For it's time, this was a bit of a daring take on Sherlock Holmes, putting his casual drug use and inferred homosexuality front and center in the character.  I should also mention the music score by Miklos Rosa, especially the poignant violin coda is wonderful.

Overall, my pleasure at this particular movie getting a Blu-ray release is very diminished by the mediocre film source used for this release.  I have a hard enough time justifying paying $30+ for old catalog titles from the likes of Twilight Time and Scream/Shout Factory but those companies at least release decent to excellent transfers using solid source material.  Not so here from Kino/MGM. I would give this movie at least 3, maybe even 4 stars for the film itself but the quality of the transfer versus the steep price for a catalog title knocks it down to 2 stars.",1407715200,21,2518,4.758620689655173

554653,5,6303091989,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be happy to know that his beloved incarnation Sherlock Holmes is having  a virtual renaissance once again in this decade on the big screen with Director Guy Ritchie's two films with Robert Downy Jr. and on the small screen with the BBC's series 'SHERLOCK' with Benedict Cumberpatch and CBS TV's 'ELEMENTARY' with Jonny Lee Miller.  It is fitting that Kino Lorber would dust off and clean the negative of Director Billy Wilder's neglected masterpiece 'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' -1970 and release it to the Blu-Ray format.  MGM released it over a decade ago on DVD and was the same version screened on Turner Classic movies these past years.  Kino has adapted it to a perfect 2.35 1080P ratio with stunning colors and sharp bit mastering so as to appreciate Cinematographer Christopher Challis's stunning images. Some of the reviewers are quibbling about the quality of the transfer but the original film's photography always had a soft focus/grainy tableau so you can not really improve on that. Screen the DVD and Blu-Ray side by side and you'll see the improvements. The wonderfully symphonic score by master Miklos Rozsa is brought forward front and center rather than left in the mud as in past prints of the film.  Released originally in a 165 minute road show print, the studio would edit it down to 125 minutes but this Blu-Ray carries over a 50 minute special feature from the DVD with added sequences to explain the deletions also including the 6 minute epilogue which exists with sound only and played over a still from the film.  The production with its sensitive portrayal by actor Robert Stephens helped pave the way for Director Herbert Ross's 'THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION'-1976 and Director Bob Clark's 'MURDER BY DECREE' -1979 by showing the Holmes character in a different light for its time.  With a great cast including Colin Blakely as Watson, Genevieve Paige as a doomed love interest and a wonderful casting choice of Sir Christopher Lee playing Holmes brother Mycroft (making him the only actor to have played both characters on the screen), the film was grossly misunderstood when first released and now Kino allows future generations to revel in the great script by Wilder and his long time partner in crime I.A.L. Diamond .  Extras include  a  30 minute video interview with Editor Ernest Waller, a wonderful 50 minute documentary carried over from the DVD  release on Sir Christopher Lee 'MR.HOLMES, MR. WILDER ' and an original theatrical trailer.  This release is a must for all Holmes fans and highly recommended.",1406937600,6,2581,4.949074074074074

The KL Blu-Ray has the WORST quality I have ever seen on any Blu-Ray, which has already been written about in ""DVD Beaver"" and in the ""Blu-Ray Reviews and Releases"". I could not believe that KINO would peddle such a horrible transfer with visible scratches, marks, etc. It looks like that the celluloid print was dragged on the floor before being scanned. The LaserDisk on the other hand was outstanding w. extras and picture quality.

So little care was applied to that movie that KINO Lorber even put the wrong year (!) on the disc itself  ""1957"" by MGM. The movie was made in 1970! They should be ashamed to peddle such obscene crap. KL should try the junk and scrap metal business instead for that they could do less damage.

Not this Blu-ray edition - which is a marginally adequate transfer, not a restoration - but the film itself: screenplay by by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. Entertaining in *every sense* of the word (including funny!), W&D's assumption was that viewers would know something (i.e., not airheads), before watching the film. And then would expect to be entertained.

I'm tossing my SD version of the movie - this one is better (somewhat) in terms of its PQ - but I'd still be watching the original even if there never had been a blue-ray release. It's the way Wilder and Diamond made movies. One of their great, late collaborations, nearly as good as 'Some Like it Hot' a decade earlier (but not in the same class as 'The Apartment'). If this is the edited version, it would be wonderful to have seen the the initial release. Roger Ebert was wrong in this instance.",1405987200,,1046,4.643243243243243

The plot is good but Robert Stephens was a poor choice for Sherlock, too much of a stage actor, make-up included. And later audiences are spoiled by the wonderful acting of Jeremy Brett and even Benedict Cumberbatch in the newer editions of Sherlock's adventures. The real reason for this review is the blu ray, which is ok in some scenes and mediocre in others. If you were hoping for demo quality, this won't be it. There are many little starlight flashes which I could ignore and some really distracting scenes with more obvious problems. Some of the scenes are very clear and the Scottish scenery is nice. But Kino Lorber obviously didn't give this movie the star treatment for any sort of resotration. I haven't seen the DVD release with this cover, so I can't say whether it is worth your while to upgrade to blu for six more dollars. But I'm not going to check that out. I will keep this though because of Christopher Lee as Mycroft and Genevieve Page, the mysterious beautiful woman.",1405900800,2,1080,4.601036269430052

Even in it's butchered state, this is one of the most interesting Sherlock films. Wilder doesn't really reinvent Holmes, but he, aided by Robert Stevens and Colin, brings a sadness, humanity and, yes, humor, to the genre. Perhaps Miklos Rozsa's score (reusing his Violin Concerto) gives the film it's soul.

There is a lot of action and good character development. I think Christopher Lee is the only name I recognized in the cast. it's an OK story, but the only reason it is ""the private life"" is because Holmes will tell Watson what is happening all around Watson so he can write about it only if the story is not told during their lifetime. Part of the reason is international intrigue and part is the attraction Holmes feels for the young lady whom Holmes and Watson are ostensibly helping to find her missing husband. The viewer's suspicions are arisen early through the use of a parasol and a very mysterious group of monks who seem to turn up in the strangest places.

His dancing scene with the ballet troop although entertaining is  obviously an out take from Hollywood's musical days. Who would have known that Watson was a party animal with strong dancing talent? Watson's character can easily be compared to George in the Seinfeld TV series, loud all the time and occasionally quite obnoxious.

555111,5,6303091989,"Robert Stevens is wonderfully camp as Holmes. At first he may seem just too theatrical in rather theatrical makeup but he rapidly grows on you as the film progresses. There are delicious moments in this near pastiche, such as Holmes and German spy Gabrielle (Genevieve Page) riding a bicycle built for two in the Scottish countryside.  If you are a die hard Conan Doyle aficionado, you might not relish Colin Blakely as the slightly bumptious Doctor Watson but he provides some of the film's lighter moments. Mycroft Holmes,  Sherlock's even smarter brother, played by Christopher Lee, (who has also played Sherlock) is Conan Doyle spot on as is the clucking Mrs. Hudson (Irene Handl).As a threesome, Holmes, Watson and Page are really enchanting, hiding together behind gravestones, behind a sliding door or rowing in Loch Ness where their boat is capsized by what Watson is sure is the Loch Ness Monster. You may have to look quickly, but the grave digger is Stanley Holloway.

The film is a mixed bag of Russian ballet dancers, midgets, trappist monks, German spies, canaries and even Queen Victoria.  Light-hearted and imaginative  ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes""deposits you in Victorian England (and Scotland) where you'll have a good time, trust me!",1397088000,2,1262,5.0772946859903385
555112,4,6303091989,Enjoyed the BBC series Sherlock.  It got me curious about other movies made about the interesting consulting detective.  I noticed that many things from the past movies made about him were used in the BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.  Also interested in reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original books about the funny hat detective.  I enjoyed this movie and will probably watch it again sometime.,1396656000,,425,5.205882352941177

I was the one asking questions about this figure's habits (hypodermic needles and such).... my husband says, ""yeah, I remember reading Sherlock Holmes got ""high"".  Imagine my surprise.

Not the ones with a buffoonish Dr. Watson from the forties, but that's because I've read the books many times and know that John Watson wasn't stupid by any means, but merely conventional in his thinking.  When it came to medical practices John Watson was in his own way a Genius like his friend Sherlock.  But I digress.  This is a very good movie, in very crisp and clean format that any fan of the venerable duo will enjoy.  I heartily recommend a large bowl of hot buttered popcorn, a chilled refreshing beverage, and a couple of hours to sit back and enjoy the movie and be wowed by the mental gymnastics of the world's first and greatest Consulting Detective, after all...It's elementary my dear reader.",1391990400,,820,4.589041095890411

It was not in evidence beyond the many attempts (and by attempts I mean failures) at sophomore humor written into the script. Watson is portrayed as a classless, pedantic buffoon and a womanizer. Holmes, while pretending to be above human sentiment is portrayed NOT as the brilliant mind that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote him, but a man who stumbles about and barely makes deductions on his own. The movie just was not as captivating as I had hoped. In fact, it fell quite short of portraying a 'real' Sherlock Holmes, instead becoming more boring by the minute. Dreadful. Pass this one by, unless you are more of a die-hard Holmes fan than I and insist on watching even this terrible portrayal.

This movie is less entertining but I think at the time it was made it was probably good. This movie has its moments and purportedly portrays the real Holmes in several vignettes. Apparently, this version is heavily edited and several scenes in the original are missing.
It is not a bad movie. Filming and music score are nice. Directed by Billy Wilder. Nice movie for a rainy afternoon. The movie warns of mature themes but I think this is a bit of overkill. If you are extremely conservative concerning any sexual matters than -yes- it might be offensive.

""Sunset Boulevard"" with its jaded narrator offering his point of view over an increasing claustrophobic pace.  The audience suffers with the characters...staggering up the street with Ray Milland and his typewriter in The Lost Weekend"". I see none of the writing, performance, or directorial genius from any of those films here. I can't recommend it. However, having said that - the writers who have carefully crafted and help realize the energetic and interesting modernization of the A.C.D. character in the television series ""Sherlock"", claim they were mightily influenced by this film.

555635,5,6303091989,"Sherlock Holmes and his trusty companion Watson embark on their greatest adventure yet to help a grieving widow in a case that involves missing midgets, Trappist monks, and the Loch Ness monster! With THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, director Billy Wilder takes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters and adds his own signature brand of humor in what was originally intended as an episodic road show picture. In its edited theatrical release, the structure and pacing become highly uneven between the first and second acts, although the strength of Wilder's script rarely falters as a result. Robert Stephens is simply brilliant as the famed detective, delivering plenty of dry wit and playful androgyny that set his performance apart from all others. Colin Blakely is equally enjoyable as Dr. John Watson, Holmes' excitable colleague who has turned an effeminate cocaine addict into a modern myth thanks to the somewhat fictionalized accounts that he has been submitting to The Strand periodical. Christopher Lee also appears in another dashing role as Holmes' elder brother Mycroft, who is shown to be of superior intellect and social standing despite his lack of celebrity. THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is an exciting, edgy, and wildly entertaining twist on the old familiar characters that explores many of the unanswered questions behind the world's finest consulting detective.

555636,4,6303091989,"I saw this movie many years ago, and was delighted to find it again. I had forgotten that Billy Wilder wrote, produced and directed it as an homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The movie is almost as wonderful as I remember, although I find Colin Blakely as Dr. Watson to be loud and annoying. I had to mute the film every time he went into one of his over the top scenes.  Robert Stephens and Genevieve Page are just splendid, and the plot is terrific.  A fun movie!",1338336000,,465,4.213483146067416
555637,5,6303091989,"I admit to being a bit biased in favor of anything Sherlock Holmes.  I am a long time fan of the character (and stories).  The VHS was ordered after I first saw the movie on Turner Classic Movies during the Sherlock Holmes marathon.  It was quite inexpensive, no doubt due in part to the increasing popularity of the DVD format.  The actors were quite believable, the sets appropriate and the storyline in step with the character.  All told, an entertaining and pleasant experience.",1264550400,2,482,4.759036144578313
555638,5,6303091989,"This 1970's film directed by the genius of Billy Wilder, who made over 90 films in his life time, (not one a dud) adapted the film from the novel by I.A.L. Diamond, focusing on the human side of the most famous detective in history.

Robert Stevens as Holmes is more ""real"" for lack of a better term, as Wilder shows not only his genius but his addiction to cocaine, and his prudishness, typical of the times and an emotional side that most of us have barely caught a glimpse.

The term ""Classic"" has been bandied around a lot lately, even calling 21st century films, ""True Classics."" Well, this film was made in 1970, directed by a genuis who had been making films in Hollywood since the 1920's.

""Private..."" has that good old atmosphere to it; a certain amount of irony and tongue and cheek to keep the most cynical intrigued because it doesn't take it self too seriously...a melodrama yes, but something of old Hollywood in the love story. Sorry, but Holmes falls in love and in the books, it was only hinted at once. (I hope this is not a spoiler, but an aspect of the film, (particularly Holmes fans and film lovers' generally to see the film again or seek it out.)

Colin Blakely as Dr. Watson is one of the most funny and charming interpretations of the character that has been done...not over the top, but funny and reveals a great concern for his unusual friend.

A True Classic, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes IS a gem and should be in every Holmes fan's DVD library.

Excellent.",1209427200,7,1495,4.498154981549815
555639,4,6303091989,"Boasting an excellent cast (including Christopher Lee of former Dracula and current Lord of the Rings fame), this 1970 film directed by none other than Billy Wilder engages the redoubtable Sherlock Holmes (well played by Robert Stephens) in a complex tale involving midgets, canaries, Trappist monks, the Loch Ness monster, a beautiful widow, a top secret government project, and a very stuffy Queen Victoria--among other items.
Also included are a haughty Russian ballerina, a Stradivarius violin, Sherlock's supercilious but wickedly intelligent brother Mycroft, hints of sexual deviance, and a drunken Dr. Watson.  Oh yes, and let's not forget a woman in a wheelchair, a signalling parasol, and a Scottish castle under construction.
Put these all together and you get a devilishly entertaining film shot through with Holmes' mordant wit (for which Watson is the perfect foil), and, as well, with his keen intelligence.  The only (minor) flaw I found was how it was that Holmes was not able to decipher the real identity of a critical personage in the tale; that person's real identity was supplied by someone other than Sherlock, which was very surprising.  Nevertheless, this is a great film that never bores. Laughter, thrills, and puzzles abound.
Colin Blakely is Dr. Watson--to a T.  The remaining supporting cast is equally fine.  A shame this is not yet on DVD.  Perhaps someday....
Highly recommended.",1042934400,18,1411,5.248888888888889
555640,5,6303091989,"From the maker of The Apartment and Some Like It Hot, a film about Sherlock Holmes might seem a strange project. But Billy Wilder not only gave us the best of the post-Basil Rathbone movies about the Baker Street sleuth, he came close to making his best film ever. He might have succeeded but for the old story of studio interference. By all accounts, the film was originally intended to consist of four interwoven stories. But fears about excessive running time reduced that to two with one of them being more a diversion than a subplot. Even so, what remains is a thoroughly enjoyable experience filled with memorable performances, droll dialogue, atmospheric visuals and a brilliantly evocative musical score.
Miklos Rozsa's music is an integral part of the film. Primarily a reworking of the composer's Violin Concerto, Wilder reportedly loved the music so much that he constructed entire sequences to fit the music, rather than the other way around. And what music it is. The melody for solo violin taken from the concerto's second movement - which might, in another film, be called the ""love theme"" - is among the best and most beautiful music Rozsa ever wrote and adds immeasurably to the film's style and feel.
Even more important, of course, are the performances by Wilder's carefully assembled cast. As Sherlock Holmes, Robert Stephens is deliciously camp - even his makeup is more theatrical than cinematic. At first, he seems to be overdoing it, but it soon becomes apparent just how perfectly his performance suits - and dictates - the mood of the piece. Hardly a star name - Stephens was primarily a stage actor - it was probably a risk to cast him, but a risk that paid off with fantastic results. You will not forget Robert Stephen's Sherlock Holmes in a hurry.
Not content with a dazzling lead performance, Wilder surrounds Stephens with a solid supporting cast. Colin Blakely is a perfect counterpoint as Watson - more exasperated than bumbling, full of a medical man's common sense. As the woman who comes into Holmes's life, Genevieve Page is even more ravishing than usual, yet always makes the various shifts in her character totally believable. Christopher Lee cuts an imposing figure as Sherlock's smarter brother Mycroft, while the great Irene Handl fusses and sighs effectively as Holmes's landlady Mrs Hudson. Clive Revill provides a comic Russian while Stanley Holloway pops up as a gravedigger (just as he did in Olivier's Hamlet).
The complicated plot, which takes Holmes from London to Loch Ness, not only provides him the opportunity to (possibly) fall in love but also manages to squeeze in Russian ballerinas, German spies, circus dwarfs, trappist monks, Queen Victoria, an early submarine, and a certain Scottish monster. It's a hard film to take seriously but, luckily, Wilder obviously had no intention of being overly serious. Conan Doyle purists will no doubt find much in the film to shake their heads about. But lovers of imaginative and witty films will revel in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.",1026172800,34,3041,4.976424361493124
7836723,5,6303091989,"One of the best films inspired by Sherlock Holmes that you will ever find. Impressively true to the characters and flavor of the original, while expanding the universe just enough to be extremely satisfying to any Holmesian. Particularly wonderful to see a portrayal (from 1970 no less!) which actually integrates queerness, and not even as a punchline. Fifty years later, and to my knowledge this has never been attempted again, so it's quite a treat if only for that reason.
