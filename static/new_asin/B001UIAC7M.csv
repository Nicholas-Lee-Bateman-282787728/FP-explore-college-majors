8343809,5,B001UIAC7M,"This is an excellent movie that portrays the hardships of the poor in Mexico City.  A well-to-do gentlemen is robbed and then mistaken for being poor.  He lives with the poor to learn their lifestyle and gain another perspective.  Of course, he comes into contact with the beauty that is Elvira Quintana.  She has several excellent song solos throughout the movie.  The only flaw is that in my opinion she chooses the wrong fellow in the end.  Something, which is actually typical of her films.",1241654400,,494,4.752941176470588
