6491194,5,B00LM6P4I4,Great film covering the unbeatable 80's New Wave music!,1428451200,,55,5.222222222222222
6491195,4,B00LM6P4I4,An interesting documentary on the history of Standard Ballet. Lots of cool vintage footage from the early days of the band. Made me go out and purchase a couple of the live concert dvds that are available.  If you are or were a fan of the band back in the 80 ' s you will find Soul Boys of the Western World worth getting.,1425686400,4,322,4.03125
8666563,5,B00LM6P4I4,"This is an exceptionally well executed documentary about a top band from the 80's. I was pleasantly surprised at how thoroughly interesting this was, so much so that I could have immediately watched it again. If you liked the 80's music scene, this is worth seeing. And if you like Spandau's mega-hits ""True"" and ""Gold"", this blu-ray is a must have!
Don't be fooled by the cover photo. This is a substantial, multi-faceted work that is masterfully assembled.",1527120000,,458,4.884615384615385

8666566,5,B00LM6P4I4,"A must-have for any Spandau fan!  An incredibly thorough history of, not only Spandau, but of the music scene of the '70's-'80's.  Don't miss this!",1486771200,,147,4.84
8666567,5,B00LM6P4I4,"I absolutely love Spandau Ballet. I received the DVD for Christmas from my parents, but my dog stole it off the counter one day, before I could watch it and she chewed it to shreds. This was my second copy. The documentary was a lot of fun to watch. I really enjoyed watching how their journey as a band evolved. They are wonderful and I'm so glad that they got back together to have a happy ending.",1456876800,,399,4.194805194805195

8666569,5,B00LM6P4I4,"A fascinating document of an era tracing the history of a country, a culture alongside that of a remarkably unique band of artisan pop. I highly recommend this film, even if you aren't a fan of the band or the music. Wonderfully edited and presented. Entertaining, thought-provoking.",1436313600,3,283,5.042553191489362
8666570,3,B00LM6P4I4,DVD is a good documentary for those wanting to find out more of whatever happened to the group Spandau Ballet. Its musical performances are secondary to the disc. Those looking for a musical capsule of them are better off looking elsewhere.,1435968000,,240,4.878048780487805
8666571,5,B00LM6P4I4,"As with everything SPANDAU BALLET, this DVD is done with class, style, flair and complete honesty. Even when talking about the difficult things the band went through, none of the band members shied away from the truth. It was excellent to see so much footage from their childhoods and the beginnings of the band, a lot of it we here in the USA never got to witness. This DVD was very well done and a must own for SPANDAU BALLET fans and 80z music fans alike!!",1433462400,6,459,4.348837209302325
