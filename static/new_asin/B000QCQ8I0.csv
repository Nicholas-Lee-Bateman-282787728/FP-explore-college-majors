8195757,4,B000QCQ8I0,"This comes from the Travel Channel series Legend Hunters, and profiles a hunt for Bigfoot at Monster Central in Northwest Louisiana, with Jim Lansdale of the GCBRO, as well as Ken Gerhard, Chester Moore, Derek ""Bamm Bamm"" Snell and Lee Hales a zoologist. Ken and Derek head from Houston, Texas to the Monster Central area in Louisiana. Monster Central is 60 acres, and a lot of resources for wildlife, including 'Squatch. The property is owned by Lansdale, as he and the group go on the hunt for the Wooly Boogers in the area. Lansdale describes the sighting he and his son had while out on the road near the area. Ken interviews a lady named Lynn Johnson, who saw a 'Squatch in 1995. Shawn Gregory is also another witness interviewed, and he saw two creatures in separate years. The team spreads out and looks for nesting areas. Chester Moore is unapologetically out to bag a 'Squatch, and is shown with a rifle heading to an area to get a shot. Jim shows a photo of what may be two possible 'Squatches he took accidentally while photographing something unrelated. The team sets up cameras to try to get a photo of a 'Squatch. The team of Gerhard, Snell and Hales hears a strange sound which is also picked up by the audio. Word comes that there may have been an encounter in another part of the woods. All in all, this one is not too bad, but basically the same as every other documentary. Still, I will give it about 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",1206230400,4,1441,4.441509433962264
