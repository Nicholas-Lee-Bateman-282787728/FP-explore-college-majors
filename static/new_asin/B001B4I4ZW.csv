3484268,5,B001B4I4ZW,I bought this dvd for my 15 months boy who loves music. He was fascinated and he likes it very much.,1237161600,,100,3.8095238095238093
3484269,5,B001B4I4ZW,"My 9-month-old absolutely loves this video.  He was captivated from the opening credits.  When I play the video, he sits there and claps and waves his arms.  And this is a child who really doesn't like ""popular"" television shows.  What's also amazing is that my 3-year-old was mesmerized, too.  (I am quite sure that even parents will learn a new instrument name.)  The way the video teaches the music notes is ingenious.  I would highly recommend this video for all music lovers out there.",1236729600,,490,4.761904761904762
3484270,5,B001B4I4ZW,"I gave this product as a gift.  I wasn't expecting too much as this is a DVD for really young children.  Boy, was I surprised.  The DVD teaches babies how to read 11 notes on the musical staff starting at middle C.  It also teaches many instruments and introduces rhythm.  My Goddaughter absorbed the material presented on this DVD quickly and began to apply it to songs she heard on the radio (picking out the various instruments, including the cabasa!) and soon was reading the music for simple tunes.  Her family began her on piano lessons and her piano teacher observed that she is able to identify the notes by sound alone, what is referred to as perfect pitch.  Needless to say, Trebellina was a big hit.  I have given Trebellina to many others as a gift as well.  Everyone has loved it!",1235952000,,793,4.489510489510489
3484271,5,B001B4I4ZW,"The English reviewer must not have been watching the same movie as I was.  Trebellina is a brilliant teaching tool!  Trebellina sings the note, says the name of the note, shows it on the staff and then the viewer sees the note morph into a character note and strike the proper piano key, which then makes the proper note sound.  I could not imagine what more the DVD could do to teach the sound of the note!  The DVD shows musical instruments played by a musician close up.  Though not every clip of an instrument is shown this way, a significant number are and the remainder are identified by a photo, which is more than sufficient to teach a baby to identify the sound and looks of a particular instrument.  There is so much an adult -- let alone a baby -- could learn from this DVD.  And the best part is that I know my baby learns while enjoying herself immensely!",1233705600,,868,4.320987654320987
3484272,1,B001B4I4ZW,"Despite all the rave reviews I found this DVD very poor.  It is true that every note is introduced (A,B,C,D...) on the music staff, by singing,on the keyboard and sounded on the piano, but there is very little to help the child  link the notation with musical sound.  What we need are simple tunes with the notation displayed as the tune plays.  We don't get this.

There are mistakes even in introductory part:  (she sings an e instead of an f,  and the piano sounds the last four  notes one tone lower than it should).

We do get two bars of ""old Macdonold"" where the tune is played and the notation is shown at the same time.  This is great, but it only happens for those two bars.  For the rest of the music we either get no notation at all, or we get notation for a different tune altogether.  Where we do get examples of music with matching notation the music is complicated (in many parts) and the notation does not follow the 'top line' but follows first one inner part and then another and is impossible to follow for a novice.

When ""counting the rythmn"" is introduced they use a complicated jazz piece with syncopations. This is very difficult and there is no explanation of what is going on.  The counting gives up after a bit.

There are a few sequences showing people playing instruments (some times playing a different tune to the one on the soundtrack), but in many cases all we see is a still photo of the instrument or a photo of a soft toy playing a toy instrument.",1233705600,45,1484,4.364963503649635
3484273,5,B001B4I4ZW,"Our 20-month-old twins have been watching this for about a month now. (I was desperate for something to entertain them that wouldn't rot their brains too badly!) Both of them love it, and one of them will now spontaneously sing the first five notes of the pentatonic scale, in tune. I was astonished. He can also sing some intervals now if I sing them to him. I credit this DVD for that.",1227139200,2,387,4.388888888888889
3484274,5,B001B4I4ZW,"We bought this DVD for our two year old daughter and it's been incredible.  She's learned to identify instruments, notes, and tones.  It seemed pretty basic for me and at first, but I saw how much she was learning very quickly.  It's so good that I'll be getting other copies to give as gifts to friends with children.",1226016000,,318,4.448275862068965
3484275,5,B001B4I4ZW,"My two boys (ages 5 and 7) love this video.  I found that this video captured their attention in a way other music videos never did, although I have yet to come across a video that teaches children about music in this way.  In fact, the video inspired my 7-year old to take piano lessons.  Because of the video, he could already read some musical notes.  And now my 5-year old wants in on the action and wants to learn
an instrument as well.  A great way to inspire and teach your kids about music!",1219881600,2,498,4.2
3484276,5,B001B4I4ZW,"I have 3 children ages 4, 7 and 10 who all love to watch this video.  We have had it for a little over a year and they still love it.  My oldest who refuses to take piano lessons, has taught herself to play the piano with the help of Trebellina.  My 7 year old is able to play some songs as well.  My 4 year old can locate the notes on the piano and can recognize the key if you play it for her.  It is a great, fun and entertaining way to introduce music to kids of all ages.  The animation is adorable-- it really captures and keeps kids' attention.  Not too long--just perfect.  It is so nice to see somrthing so different and creative.  It seems like every other music video for kids is just a spin off of all the others.",1216425600,2,725,3.9448275862068964

3484278,5,B001B4I4ZW,"my 2 year old loves this dvd! He watched it once and is now singing songs and recognizing melodies. He keeps wanting to watch this over and over again. He gets so excited to see it when we play it.

Definitely worth it!",1386547200,,219,4.093023255813954
3484279,5,B001B4I4ZW,"Highly recommended!! I read a review saying that Trebellina was a very good start if one wanted to have the child to learn an instrument at some point. So I purchased the DVD for my older son to watch at the age of 18 months. The content was so attractive and well designed for young children that he would sit and watch for a long stretch of time. I played it randomly once or twice a day, for a portion of the content. He seemed extremely interested whenever he was watching. He then learnt to play piano at age of 4 years and 3 months old. And it was a less stressful process. He apparently got the idea about those ""notes"" and the general structure of music from the DVD, since I really did nothing else. If I had taught him some music basics, I would start with ""dou"", ""ray"", ""mi"", as I learnt it when I was young. But fortunately I didn't. Our piano teacher said that if a child learnt ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", etc. it would be an easier transition to read the notes.
Now I just started playing the DVD for my younger son, who is 19 months old and much more active than his brother. But he would still sit down to watch the DVD and dance a little bit. I expect him to learn to play piano even earlier than his brother.
Again, highly recommended. I believe it can be played for babies as young as the parents think it's ok for the little eyes to watch a screen. And my 5-year old boy still loves to watch Trebellina after not seeing it for a while.",1368748800,,1443,4.1387900355871885
3484280,1,B001B4I4ZW,"Absolute waste of money, at least for me. My kids never enjoyed it and I don't see how it's going to help 1 or 2 year old learn music . The quality of sound and pictures not professional either.",1368403200,2,194,4.0

3484282,5,B001B4I4ZW,My eldest has enjoyed this DVD thoroughly! Trebellina has been at the top of the charts for her for months. We played it so much that the disk has given up. Just ordered the second one. Don't think I have seen anything that comes close to it. Well done,1360022400,,252,4.163265306122449
3484283,5,B001B4I4ZW,"Our two year old loves this DVD! We watch it at least twice a day. She can name all the instruments and is trying to sing along on the scales. She has many favorite songs, and insists that everyone get up and dance when they come on! I would recommend this DVD!",1355184000,,261,4.038461538461538
3484284,5,B001B4I4ZW,"My child doesn't watch regular television programs, so the simple style of this DVD is perfect.  She is 25 months old, begs to see it again and again, and sings along with the notes.  She can also name most of the instruments, but she learned that from the posters I put up in the playroom.  Now she knows the sounds they make.  I only use DVDs to reinforce what I've already taught or to teach something I am unable to teach (like Spanish or reading music).  I think this is a great companion with flash cards, musical posters and visits to many of the free music performances throughout the city.  Alone it would be a bit mundane but added to a music curriculum? Fantastic!",1321488000,,675,4.403225806451613

3484286,5,B001B4I4ZW,"My husband is a classically trained Juilliard musician and I, a former dancer..our children, ages 2 and 4, are very responsive to and have a keen interest in music - singing, dancing, and playing all kinds of instruments (as do, potentially, all kids).  As soon as we watched this video, we had to play it again, right away..oh, and again..and again!  My kids ate ""Trebellina"" up!  They were mesmerized, amused, and interactive..singing, dancing, vocalizing and repeating the notes and names of instruments.  They, immediately, went looking for their own instruments with a renewed fascination.  I enjoy the style of it, the animation reminding me of classic old 50s cartoons.  The variety of visual and audible stimuli keeps it engaging, too.  Honestly, even if I didn't love it (which I do), I would recommend it because my kids had such an enthusiastic response to something that teaches them something valuable and enjoyable!",1301443200,8,929,5.112582781456954

Educational value: Minimal. Overall, it looks like your 4-year old made his first DVD project for his younger brother. Which would be sweet. But here you are paying $20 for something you don't want for free. Would give it zero stars but you have to put in at least one. Stay away from it.",1300492800,3,448,4.409638554216867

3484289,1,B001B4I4ZW,"My 16 month old son LOVES LOVES LOVES Brainy Baby DVDs - the ABC DVD has helped him learn nearly all of his letters already! I didn't have any music DVDs and after reading the amazing reviews I decided to purchase this (bought it directly from the company). I was expecting something incredible but left wondering how in the world anyone would give this 5 stars?!

I'll admit I haven't been able to sit through the whole DVD yet...my son won't let me leave it on because both times I played it he started crying and couldn't sit through more than 10 minutes. I don't blame him! The animatation is so poor - just a few notches above stick figures. And if any DVD can give your kid ADHD I can see this being the one - things are bouncing everywhere, animation is choppy, letters and numbers are blinking here and there for no reason, the sound quality is borderline painful - Trebellina does not have anywhere near a lovely voice and sings at a high octave.

I'll give an example - one of the opening scenes says ""Bartolomeo Cristofori invented the piano"" and shows a cheesy  animation of a baby in a diaper with a jar of nails sitting by a piano and bobbing his head. What?! Good grief.

I should have stuck with the Brainy Baby DVDs - he loves the songs on there and even wants me to put the ""Colors of the Rainbow"" song on repeat as he dances, bounces, and spins around.

Wish I could return this - $23 could have bought 2 GOOD DVDs!",1298851200,2,1434,4.296296296296297
3484290,5,B001B4I4ZW,"This is no Disney production, far from it.  You will know what I mean when you first view it through your adult eyes.

But, through my toddler's eyes it is a huge hit.  My 20 month old daughter can't get enough of Trebellina and could care less about it production value. She would watch it all day if we would let her. Every morning we come down stairs and she points to the DVD player.

Like most kids she loves music.  We purchased this because of her love for music and positive recommendations.  However, we didn't buy it for her to learn to read notes. If she does pick reading music up then so be it. If you are expecting your kid to be a child music prodigy then I would not recommend this DVD.  If you want a high quality production don't but this DVD.  However, if you want your child to be entertained I would recommend it without hesitation.",1298246400,,853,4.254658385093168

I didn't expect her to learn from the DVD, I just wanted something interesting to watch with her rather than watching Ice Age 2 for the millionth time & this is now her favorite.  I recommend this one.  Parts of it are not interesting to me, like the song with the toys & the merry go round, but she is facinated by it & it makes her happy in the morning while I'm still waking up.",1281312000,,548,3.9545454545454546

Our daughter has Down Syndrome and has really taken to watching it over and over, which I think is wonderful and is truly helping her with the understanding of music.  It is a great brush up and reminder for our son who has been taking piano lessons for a few years.
We definately recommend the DVD and flash cards for a wonderful introduction to music!

3484294,1,B001B4I4ZW,"I bought this DVD for my 2 year old twins who love music. After reading all the rave reviews I purchased it on Amazon.
I was very disappointed with the quality and the sound. The animation is rudimentary at best and the songs have no rythem. I did not even finish the DVD it was so bad. The picture quality was pretty bad too, especially on the non-animated parts.
My kids lost interest quickly and I did not think it was easy to follow and make sense of it.
I play Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang & Mary Poppins instead and feel like they learn more music, rythem and song from those movies.
I would return this DVD if I could. I am seriously thinking of throwing it away. I can't give this to anyone...
I definitely do not recommend this product.",1268956800,13,756,4.256944444444445
3484295,2,B001B4I4ZW,"Upon purchasing this DVD I had hoped for a tool to teach my two children, aged 2 and 8 months how to read music. What I received however was a presentation that seemed haplessly thrown together, with little thought as to how children 4 and under actually learn.

I am a big fan of the ""Your Baby Can Read!"" series, and through my experiences with that program, as well as a lot of investigation into the work of Glenn Doman, I have learned one very important factor when it comes to teaching babies to read. And that is that what children see and what children hear should go together. In the case of music, that would mean showing the notation while simultaneously playing the note audibly. This rarely, if ever happens, on this DVD.

What does happen though, is a bunch of poorly animated, web-cartoon-like characters dance about. Row, Row, Row Your Boat is played, while showing a toy boat with a man rowing(much like Baby Einstein). And they try introducing children to the concept of rhythm with a completely ridiculous song choice. Worst of all, towards the end, they go through all the notes on screen while playing a piece of classical music. They don't play the note AT ALL, and don't even say the name of the note! This is rather like showing a child the letter A and just expecting them to learn it's called an A without ever telling them.

There are good points to this DVD however. They do introduce the notes in a haphazard way. They show quite a few different instruments, and how they sound. I have given the DVD two stars because my son loves to watch it. I do agree that this DVD does seem to speak to children. I'm just not sure it's message is all that useful for learning music.",1268784000,3,1699,4.456591639871383

3484297,5,B001B4I4ZW,"This was a Christmas present for my two sons aged 3 and a half and they absolutely love this DVD.
They have both shown a preference for musical toys so this may explain some of their enthusiasm but I would highly recommend it for any child who has a similar interest.

I find it a little basic for their age group. It covers different instruments / notes / the concept of 'rest' and rhythm but little else and I think it could include more music related words. As they are reaching the end of the intended age range this is more of an observation and a wish for a follow-on dvd than a critcism.

I am not in any way musical and so cannot attest to the accuracy of the notes played but as they watch the dvd my children dance and sing to the music, pick up an instrument and play along, and ask questions so I can attest that this dvd is encouraging their general interest in and enjoyment of music.",1262131200,,898,4.184971098265896

She's crazy about it.  Sadly, the instructional aspect could have been improved greatly without taking any of the fun out.  For example, when it is time for the notes to make music, they do it at such an amazing speed that it is impossible to tell that certain notes are making certain tones in the music.  In fact, I think the note-tone correspondence might be dropped in those sections.

But hey, the kid loves it, so she watches it, and she definitely is learning things from it, so I give it four stars.",1243900800,2,665,4.32258064516129
3484301,4,B001B4I4ZW,"""Teach Your Baby to Read Music with Trebellina,"" proclaims the DVD cover of Introducing Trebellina from the Cristofori Baby Company. Tapping into the trend towards early education (teach your baby to read, teach your baby to sign, etc.) Trebellina provides a lighthearted, informal introduction to simple music theory for one to four-year-olds.

Trebellina is an exuberant, animated treble clef that leads young children through a simple, lively introduction to Da Notes of the treble staff (a gang of bright, animated notes that live on the staff) with the help of her friends Rock Bassey (a bass cleff) and Rhythmo (an abstract representation of rhythm), while providing simple music appreciation segments. Various musical instruments, familiar songs, live action dance sequences, and rhythm recognition are all incorporated into this fast-paced half-hour program for pre-schoolers.

The child approval rating for the disc runs high in our home. All of our children from age six down to our ten-month-old baby are fascinated by the bright, fun-filled antics of Trebellina. They are learning the names of a variety of instruments, singing note names along with Trebellina, dancing to the live action sequences, and clapping along with Rhythmo. I might be imagining things, but I believe I heard our wee baby sing ""F"" after I echoed Trebellina's introduction to the note.

Personally, I don't recommend pushing young children into early academics, and my little ones aren't reading music yet. I am however, very interested in developing an affinity for music, rhythm and tonal recognition from a young age. Trebellina can be effectively used as a pre-primer to formal music lessons, as part of an informal music program for preschoolers, or even as a guilt-free babysitter for busy parents who can assure themselves that, ""Well, they are learning something at least!""

Parents looking for a highly structured program to teach their child to read sheet music won't find Trebellina the best program to use with their children. There are no formal lesson plans presented, and the pace of the video is so rapid that only a general familiarity with the concepts presented will be gained. By incorporating the parent-led teaching tips included with the DVD the learning experience can be taken deeper, and becomes more interactive rather than a passive DVD viewing experience.

Being independently produced, the music can at times be tinny or too loud, and the animation somewhat choppy but my children don't mind. In fact, if I let them have their way we'd be dancing with Trebellina upwards of three times a day! My three-year-old is her biggest fan, and our baby loves to groove along as well. The disc can be run through in one go and has the option of watching only the animated portions or live action segments.

While I remain unconvinced of the disc's ability to transform the average child into a virtuoso, this child-friendly DVD is a fun way to introduce the simplest concepts of music theory through play, bright visuals and fun tunes.",1242000000,30,3041,5.133333333333334

She matches pitches when they are played on the video or on the piano by me. She knows what notes are and that the keys on a piano match the notes I read and play.  She picks up a music book and says, Mommy look at the notes. The notes are going up here and down here. Look mommy that's trebelina ( the treble clef), that's a rest. The rest means the notes stop. No I'm not kidding!!  It's amazing really.  Get this video and play it often.",1423612800,,765,3.980392156862745

The animation looks very 80s. The characters are cute and my daughter loved them. However, she couldn't stay with it for long.",1411948800,,294,4.363636363636363
8281921,1,B001B4I4ZW,"This is the most annoying thing (besides Barney) I've ever watched. Low production quality and obviously budget. I see where they were going with it, but... I will never play it again. Found better alternatives.  And the price is RIDICULOUS. Yeesh.",1411776000,,248,5.048780487804878
8281922,3,B001B4I4ZW,"Very short video, although some information in it, its not worth the money. I won't recommend it.",1410739200,,97,4.764705882352941
8281923,5,B001B4I4ZW,"My little guy, aged 21 months, loved this.  He was totally engaged the whole time.  It's great for this age group.  I am a musical person, played piano for many years, and my kids are now in Kindermusik/piano and I think this a great little video for introducing babies to music.  It was adorable!",1406419200,,297,4.444444444444445
8281924,5,B001B4I4ZW,"My 22 mo old son loves it even more than Thomas the Train, thank God!  Wonderful CD, it was very creative.",1392336000,2,106,4.0476190476190474
8281925,5,B001B4I4ZW,"I watched the video and thought it was kinda corny. But then my 16 month old granddaughter watched it, and now she has to watch it over and over, everyday. We have it on in a spare bedroom, and she will take our hand to lead us there to watch it. Amazing! We wrote to the company, asking for more, but they are still working on that. Thank you so much for good, educational fun!",1391731200,2,378,4.053333333333334
