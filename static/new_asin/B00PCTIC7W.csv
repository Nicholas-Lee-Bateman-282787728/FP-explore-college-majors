6797745,5,B00PCTIC7W,"Ahh the B westerns. Remember fondly,going to the Saturday matinee, and enjoy at times Gene Autry,his horse Champion,and of course his side kick. I have a collection of the restored Gene Autry films.  When watching, felt like I was again sitting in the theater, instead of my easy chair.  If you are a baby boomer I know you will enjoy watching these films, and will also bring back fond memories of your childhood days, I know it does for me!",1430265600,,442,4.5125
6797746,5,B00PCTIC7W,"Another wonderful collection of Gene Autry movies with Smiley Brunette. This movie collection includes Comin' Round the Mountain 1936, Git Along Little Dogies 1937, Man from Music Mountain 1938, and Mountain Rhythm 1939.",1426636800,,220,5.696969696969697
6797747,5,B00PCTIC7W,"Nothing against Roy; he is great too.  The difference is that, if you collect his films on dvd too, there has been an utter disregard for the quality and preservation of Roy's movies on dvd, generally speaking: [The exception would be Chest films, which does a bang up job on their releases and puts the usual suspect hacks to shame.]  Some of Gene's movies have fallen into public domain also, however, they have an aggressive active agent for the estate. BIG THANK YOU, KARLA BUHLMAN!

Fantastic look and sound on these remastered films, and that goes for all dvds authorized by Autry's estate.  Bonus features are aplenty and they aren't just throwaways to make the packaging more attractive either.  I hope the entire catalog will come down a future pike in 1080 progressive scan, but in the meantime these dvd sets are a great bargain.  Oh, and if you're worried about too much quality being squeezed out because of too much material being put on a disc... don't be.  These sets have been coming out as 2 dvd9 discs per package.  The bit rate may not be the highest, but the films aren't two and a half hours either... so together with the bonus features, the data rate is sufficient -- it looks good on a 1080p 37"" t.v. with an upconverting dvd player, and would likely be awesome in a high-def  blu-ray format.

8687510,5,B00PCTIC7W,"Overall, these pictures are enjoyable.  One is a bit less so.  Here's several things I noticed.

COMIN' ROUND THE MOUNTAIN - Gene is a Pony Express rider.  There is one classic scene, supposedly Gene trying to break a horse, but it is actually a clip from THE DEVIL HORSE and it is Yakima Canutt doing the dangerous stunt with the rampaging horse.  On the ""Melody Ranch Theater"", Ann Rutherford is the guest.

GIT ALONG LITTLE DOGIES - This one was copied from a re-release print and the picture quality is not quite as good as the others.  Not bad though.  This movie is filled with so much corny hokum that it leaves little time for the pitiful plot.  On ""Melody Ranch Theater"", even Gene and Pat Buttram's commentary is pointless and boring.

MAN FROM MUSIC MOUNTAIN - This has a nice clear picture.  The story is by Betty Burbridge but is still pretty good.  The guest on ""Melody Ranch Theater"" is famed director George Sherman, who is a surprisingly small man, but the commentary is more boring than you would expect.

MOUNTAIN RHYTHM - This one has much the same plot as MUSIC MOUNTAIN, but with more songs and the comedy is a little better.  The guests on ""Melody Ranch Theater"" are Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.  Pretty good.

I gave this set five stars because it is generally enjoyable, even though one of the movies is not quite as good as the usual Autry movie.  It is well worth the price.",1500768000,,1399,4.488095238095238
