8104526,4,B00006ADHC,"I enjoyed watching this tape as much as the first time I saw it on TV, however, the quality of the tape was not the best.  Parts of it was very, very dark to almost black.  I wish that someone would restore the quality of this program and re-release it on a DVD.",1312243200,,262,3.9245283018867925
8104527,5,B00006ADHC,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE SERIES---A 2 PARTER THAT DEALS WITH FAMILY CRISIS & DEATH AND COMING TOGETHER IN THE END.  THE ACTORS ARE SUPERB AND THE STORY LINE IS FANTASTIC.,1183852800,2,176,4.176470588235294
8104528,5,B00006ADHC,"I loved this episode so much when I saw it on tv recently, that I started looking for it on video or dvd to buy!  The story is great, the acting is fantastic, and everything is so much like how it can be in real life.  I was touched by the love for God that was displayed by Delta Burke, who I felt wasn't acting at all, but living a real experience.  I feel she is the icing on the cake for this show.",1026432000,13,402,3.761904761904762
