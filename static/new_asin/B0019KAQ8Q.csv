8274192,5,B0019KAQ8Q,"A story of Hitler's second book written 5 years after Mein Kaumf. This story goes deep into why the book was not released, and Hitlers feelings when he wrote it and how they changed as time went on. This book in question deals manily with Hitler's thoughts on America and goes deeper into his plans of conquest once he assumes power. I have seen many documentaries on Hitler and the third reich and this one is definately very well made... Like I said absolutely fascinating!",1269561600,2,475,4.6
