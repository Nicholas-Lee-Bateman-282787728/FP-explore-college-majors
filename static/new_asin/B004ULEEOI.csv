8441762,5,B004ULEEOI,This is a great old black and white movie with significant actors of its time. Superb story line and film noir cinematography. Shockingly graphic ending for the era. You will watch it more than once. I saw it first in 1973 and was surprised and pleased to find it on Amazon.,1466553600,,274,4.392156862745098

8441764,5,B004ULEEOI,"Dear Movie-Viewers,
I saw this movie for the first time about 45 years ago.
  It was slow at points.  And had some continuity problems.
  But I saw it again this morning.
  And I felt this morning what I felt long ago.
  I love this little black & white movie.
  I love the meaning behind it.
  And a lot of the acting.
  And I just love the fact that it was made;
  and is still around.
  I leave the rest to your good offices.
Sincerely, Frank Braio",1430784000,,451,4.034883720930233
8441765,5,B004ULEEOI,"My understanding is that The Ceremony was Laurence Harvey's first project as director, actor,and producer.  The film contains multiple universal themes ranging from the abstract involving political necessity, justice, and the death penalty; the metaphysical, what is life, what is living; what is faith and redemption; to the brutally human rivers of love and lust, courage and weakness, loyalty and betrayal. Perhaps the movie suffers from trying to do too much within the space it contains but for me Laurence Harvey effort is superlative.",1414886400,,541,5.440476190476191
8441766,2,B004ULEEOI,"I didn't enjoy this movie. I liked Sarah Miles. That's about it. I'm guessing that Laurence Harvey had gained some fame and fortune from ""Room at the top,"" so that he felt confident enough to venture into directing and producing. He had a good cast at his disposal but still managed to stumble,which makes me think that he didn't have a serious idea of what he was trying to put across. For example, Ross Martin was trying very hard to be an evil person, and Sarah Miles was vluptuous as always.  At this point in time in Great Britain, a number of aimless movies were produced (following on the heels of some very good movies throughout the 40s and 5os) which I think might have been influenced by the experimentation of the times. This might in fact be more the root cause.
Some people felt they could put out movies that were soty of ""arty,"" yet which conveyed no distinct message. There were some movies at that time that  were transitional yet successful, such as for example ""The System."" There is a fight scene between Laurence Harvey and Robert Walker Junior that is laughingly lacking in any fundamental ""fight"" feeling. I  really think it was a lack of direction that was the culprit.",1387497600,2,1194,4.596244131455399
8441767,2,B004ULEEOI,"Great example of the 1960's Childish-Aesthetic: Actors and story feel a bit stupid, unexplained, and oversimplified so it bores like a children's level story intellectually that is played with adults.

Yet the childish presentation alternates with some great one liner truths. The Tangiers' leader wants some credibility for Tangiers by having real law enforcement that the world believes they don't have. And near the end a priest forces the criminal to understand that there is some good in men with a brilliant statement about God and the criminal's brother, a type of statement which is rarely seen in a film.

Sara Miles satisfies as mentally tormented beauty girlfriend wanted by two men. Always sad when she leaves the screen.

1960's anti-establishment ending, on an emotional level, somehow blames the authorities for the criminals stealing and ruining of his own family; this is the ending ""twist"" to satisfy the non-sense sensibilities of the day - Ug!",1341792000,4,963,5.2
8441768,4,B004ULEEOI,"Very uneven sometimes amateurish production but full of creativity, wonderful lighting, sharp performances and atmosphere. A must for a Laurence Harvey fan. His only directorial effort. Good score as well",1306454400,2,204,5.833333333333333
