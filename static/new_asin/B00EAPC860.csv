5899751,5,B00EAPC860,"This show just gets better and better. I watched Season 1 & 2 on Netflix in a weekend. I was hooked immediately.  Season 3, episode 1 the best yet.",1376352000,8,147,4.068965517241379
5899752,5,B00EAPC860,"This TV series, ""Hell On Wheels"", by AMC is extraordinary, and in my opinion The Best out there right now. Seasons 1 and 2 were GREAT, in which Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) wasn't too fond of the railroad business at Hell On Wheels. And sometimes he wanted to run away and never come back. But his care and affection for Ms. Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) kept him from leaving the Hell On Wheels.
I was waiting for Season 3 to arrive impatiently, and finally it's here!! In Season 3, he, Cullen Bohannon, is like a new man. It seems to me as rebirth of Cullen Bohannon; with renewed spirit and enthusiasm for the railroad, and to finish the railroad, as the new Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad.
I highly recommend everyone to watch this TV series. All the episodes of all three seasons are great; you don't have to skip through episodes to find a good one.

UPDATE: After watching the first 3 episodes of Season 3, I really really miss the absence of Ms. Lily Bell. She was a great addition to the show; I do not have the slightest idea why the producer/writer decided to leave her out after Seasons 1 & 2. In my opinion, her presence in the current Series (Season 3) would have made it even more engaging to watch. She, Ms. Lily Bell, made Cullen Bohannon complete. I really wish the producer/writer brings her back in the upcoming Seasons, please!!
But still this a great Series, no doubt about that; and we are seeing a lot of new faces in each episode. But one request to the producer/writer, PLEASE BRING MS. LILY BELL BACK!!!",1376179200,21,1548,4.48936170212766
5899753,5,B00EAPC860,"Hell on Wheels is yet another great show that AMC has made. Season three is just as good as the previous two. It is off to a great start! Durant is in jail while Cullen is taking over Durant's duties. I can't wait to see what the rest of the season has in store. I Am hoping that this will not be its last season because this show deserves more recognition than it gets. Great Show, you won't be disappointed!",1376179200,9,409,4.125

5899757,1,B00EAPC860,"The main character in this series is a confederate soldier who married a Northerner whose wife convinced him to free his slaves before the Civil War - WHICH did not make sense to him at all, but he did any, and then paid his ""slaves"" to work his fields.  He joins the war wearing the gray and lost.  His focus on building the railroad towards the Pacific comes with new challenges dealing with the Tribal Nations, who are the original inhibitants of the now ""United States"".  This show DEFIANTLY villianizes the TRUE inhibatants of North America, before the TRUE land owners were swindled and forced to move out of their lands and to move to the ""reservations""  by the ""United States"".  The true leaders of the original land owners were devastated and lost their lives because of advanced warfare.  This series is based on promoting the invasion not from the landowners viewpoint but from the invaders view, and they make it view like it was ""moral"" from coast to coast, no matter the cost.",1497225600,,990,4.660919540229885

5899840,1,B00EAPC860,"Season 1 and Season 2 were good, but after forcing myself to get through Season 3 & 4, which just got more and more painful to watch, I feel compelled to warn people who are thinking about watching this show to steer clear of it. It will disappoint in an extreme way and is worse than shows that end mid-story after 2-3 Seasons.

The list of ways in which they ruined this show is long. And I'm not taking the time to list more than 3 of them. After Season 2 the plots make no sense, the characters keep changing their personalities in ways that make no sense, the Frankenstein horror show character becomes intolerably creepy and just doesn't fit into the show or the story, and the overall story gets too boring to tolerate. It's an overall spiral downward and a real disappointment. AMC took a show with good potential and completely ruined it with Season 3, 4 & onward.

DO NOT get into this show. It's just not worth it.

SPOILER ALERT FOR THE FOLLOWING:

The awful parts of this show from Season 3 and onward are too numerous to list. But there are a few honorable mentions.

On top of the list is ""The Swede."" Although he was killed at the end of Season 2, they resurrect him. Bad news. Unless you like watching a very creepy Frankenstein in the middle of the post Civil War era (which of these things just doesn't belong?!) it's awful. His character belongs in a bad horror movie, not a western. Think Jeffrey Dahmer in a Western. Ugh. I'm all for putting sadistic bad guys into the show, but leave outright, never ending creepiness for the Halloween horror shows. Then, when you kill the bad guy, bring another bad guy in that we can love to hate, don't resurrect the dead, creepy Frankenstein! And certainly don't leave the plots relying on this character. Then, when this creepy Frankenstein kills a boy's parents just for the fun of it, after winning the parents' and the boy's trust, allow the boy the opportunity to kill the bastard by the end of the season. This character played a big part in ruining Seasons 3 & 4.

Next on the list was the killing of Lilly Bell at the end of Season 2, by none other than the creepy Frankenstein (known in the show as ""The Swede""), the serial killer who loves to kill for the joy and pleasure of it. This Jeffrey Dahmer Frankenstein who doesn't belong in a Western just killed one of the favorite characters. Not only doesn't her death get avenged after they resurrect Frankenstein, I mean, The Swede, for Season 3, but they just completely kill off the love story with her death.

Then they start changing personalities of characters mid-show. They did it forgivably with ""Mr. Toole"" after he was shot by Elam. But when in Seasons 3 & 4 they took a dumb, goofy Irish magic show boy and made him into a shrewd businessman and a serial killer who backstabs and then literally kills his brother in cold blood, it's so ridiculous, it makes it intolerably unwatchable.

DO NOT get into this show. It's downright awful after Season 2.

AMC took a show with good potential and completely ruined it.",1451692800,,3043,4.488245931283906

5899887,5,B00EAPC860,"Well, for all you Deadwood fans out there, this is better by a long rifle shot. There was an odd attraction to that western, and the plot was always rather vacuous, but the dialogue writing was over the top. Hell on Wheels cover the full spectrum of over-the-top. I bought all the episodes for my Kindle, it was that good. Fargo and Walking Dead are the only others I garnered first. This updated and gritted up western is awesome. Acting is top notch to go with the twisting and turning plot line. Great bad guys chase the good guys and vice versa. Hell on Wheels actually gets better as the seasons progress. Westerns are maybe an acquired taste, and it does have some brutal violence at times. So, get over it, and watch it.

If you haven't yet grabbed a Kindle, just do it, as Nike says. I have the 9 inch HDX with 18gb(get more GB's) and videos on this unit blow away any other iPad-like device on the market. These videos like Hell on Wheels look ridiculously good on the 2500x1600(1920x1080 is your HDTV's resolution) screen that is the industry leader for clarity. Even with my glasses on, I cannot see a pixel from 6 inches away. Try that with your device! Get Hell on Wheels for your Kindle and you will love it, and can also be played on your Playstation or computer too.",1441584000,,1282,4.409282700421941
5899888,5,B00EAPC860,"I have watched a lot of great TV series in my day.  The Sopranos, The Killing, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, and Rectify I consider to be the best that TV has to offer.  I was introduced to Hell on Wheels from a coworker of mine who insisted that I would love it.  Originally, the name and the time period turned me off.  After an attempt at Dead Wood, I had no interest in watching a western series again for a long time.  Out of boredom, I began watching Hell on Wheels.  Admittedly, I felt it was a little slow compared to the others I mentioned above, but yet I still found it interesting.  As the show progressed however it got better, a lot betterso much so that I would say it deserves to be included with those series I mentioned above.  If you have a little bit of historian in you or if you are interested in knowing how the railroad was built and subsequently how our country was built than watch this series.  The detail put into this series is amazing and some of the views you will see are spectacular.  This series accurately portrays the hardships of life in 1865.  Beyond that, there are a lot of twists and turns, personal drama and shocking events that will keep you engaged throughout this series.  I find it hard to watch only one episode at a time. This is truly a magnificent and entertaining series to watch.",1441411200,,1330,4.340080971659919

However I must say for those who are not aware, the history shared regarding mormons is not accurate in the slightest, Coming from someone who has studied mormon history good and bad, this show has obviously decided to make mormons seem like a bad, hypocritical, self righteous, violent, non christian , people who worshipped Brigham Young.  This is a good show, but it is purely fictional and the instances regarding mormons is very far from the truth.  Please keep this in mind as you watch it.

I greatly enjoy the quality of this show, and believe that even if it is not completely accurate, it gives a feel for how things must have been during the building of the transcontinental railroad.

5900086,5,B00EAPC860,"Hell on Wheels - The Third Season  [548 2014-06-20]

Summary:
 Season 3 continues the fictional drama set against the backdrop of the building of the transcontinental  railroad. The tribulations of former Southern soldier Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) in overcoming all obstacles to complete the railroad have kept my interest for 3 seasons now.

Content:
  The Season 3 package consists of 3 disks and 10 episodes originally show on the AMC Network during the period August 2013 through October 2013. Also included are several special features on disk 3 that I found worth watching. Oddly there are no deleted or extended scenes but disk 3 has a brief synopsis of each of the ten season 3 shows.

Positive Comments:
 OK this is a fictional account of the building of the 1st transcontinental  railroad in the United States. Nonetheless the series does present in a dramatized fashion just how difficult an undertaking it was and the many grave obstacles that had to be overcome. As a history lesson it get my approval.
 The dramatic conflicts involving the characters, while far fetched, and at times over the top, involve types that are representative of the period; we have free blacks, Irish immigrants, prostitutes, a newspaperwoman, Mormons, Indians, senators and even a Union General - U.S. Grant -  to mention a few.
 Giving the show a strong degree of authenticity in season 3 are the many scenes concerning Credit Mobilier and it's financial involvement in construction of the Union Pacific Railroad.
 I cannot praise enough the wonderful vistas of the railroads, trains and construction crews against the scenic backdrops in this show.

The Cast:
  I contend a good TV series - aspiring to greatness -  has to have great villains - people you love to hate - and this show has two: Christopher Heyerdahl as Thor Gundersen - he is known as ""the Swede"", and is as crazy a pisser You could imagine. Colm Meaney as Thomas ""Doc"" Durant, a businessman and investor in the First Transcontinental Railroad, who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal to make a fortune.

Negative Comments:
 During season 3 some of the individual stories that thread there way throught the series seem contrived, unrealistic and greatly drawn out.

Recommendations:
With this collection I have watched all 3 season of this thoughtful series. This is an interesting show, with a compelling story line and some fabulous actors and, as such, is highly recommended.

My Opinion:
  My viewing habits are not to be subject to a specific time and day to watch a show - and I abhor commercial interruptions. I am more that satisfied to wait until the season is released on DVD - then wait six months for the price to drop and pick it up cheaper on E-Bay.",1413504000,,2732,4.863636363636363

That's why I don't understand the limit on the dvd.

5900217,5,B00EAPC860,"I love HELL ON WHEELS. It just keeps getting better and better. In a day when a good Western is hard to come by, HELL ON WHEELS slakes the thirst of many who crave a good Oater. There continues to be an epic, poetic feel to the development of this series as characters grow in ways we would never expect. Others, most notably Colm Meaney's Thomas Durant, stay as consistently rotten as we want them to be, while still others, like Christopher Heyerdahl's The Swede transform in ways beyond our wildest expectations.

This is one of the great aspects of this show, it is so character-driven. Yes, it has plenty of gun-play (with apparently computerized gun shots, requiring the actors to hold their guns as if they are really shooting, then ""act"" the recoil, all the while avoiding the temptation to say ""bang!""--this from a colleague who worked on the show) and plenty of other action: fist fights, domestic fireworks, full scale Indian attacks, etc. But all of these Western accoutrements are made all the more meaningful by the participation of characters we have come to care about, root for or despise, depending on who they are.

The truly outstanding way in which HELL ON WHEELS continues to grow and be marketed is that the DVD/Blu-ray releases are so thoughtfully prepared. Aside from the nice packaging and the enjoyment of watching the ten episodes that comprise each season without commercial interruption, there is a train load of extras in each season's release. True to form, the discs for The Complete Third Season come with the following extras:
A Look at Season 3
Where Season 2 Left Off
Four Behind-the-Scenes Featurettes
Ten ""Inside the Episodes"" Featurettes

These are not extras for the sake of extras, either. Rather they assume that the viewer cares about the show as much as the filmmakers do. Almost everyone seems to appear in the extras, whether its Common giving a tour of the set, or Anson Mount ruminating on the journey his character is taking, or the producers talking about the vision and direction of the show. And of course the purpose of all this is to prime audiences for the impending return of the series: Season Four starts at the beginning of August.

As a fan of HELL ON WHEELS all I can say is I'm saddled up and waiting to go. I think you will be, too.",1407110400,,2296,4.689826302729529

5900221,5,B00EAPC860,This series is very good but it makes you feel dirty because all the characters seem to need a bath. I was eager to begin this series as the producers killed off a lot of the previous characters that one thought would always be a part of the story line. I've only seen a couple of episodes but one intriguing character has already caught my eye. A female reporter looks like Dr. Isle of Rizzoli and Isles. I don't think it's Sasha but could it be her sister? I wonder.,1406937600,,468,4.211111111111111

5900225,5,B00EAPC860,"Are you kidding me? This has to be my favorite TV series in a long time. I flipped on the first episode by accident once. It was a repeat after the first season had ended. I got hooked from the first episode. I didn't realize until later that I had actually seen the first episode which didn't ruin anything for me. Characters are being killed off quite frequently to the point that hardly anyone is left after the second season but the 3rd season still doesn't disappoint. If you haven't watched this series, I recommend you do. I'm not a huge fan of westerns but I do love this historical time period. The story lines between characters are what make this show but I think the creators of the show do a good job of giving you an idea of what it might have been like to live (and die) in this era. It certainly wasn't easy living back then. You also can't help but feel for the plight of the Natives whom I wish were in the show a bit more. At any rate, give this show a shot. I hope you aren't disappointed!",1406764800,2,1009,4.17948717948718

The writers, directors and the actors are all amazing. If you love History like I do you will love this show! It is so interesting to watch how the West was developed, starting with the train and the writers have done a great job telling this story! There is lot a great acting done by Anson Mount, a character who has evolved over the last 3 seasons! I can't wait to see how the writers will portray him this season. This season it will be going to 13 episodes because of the fans who have made this show a hit! In my opinion AMC is a great channel with a lot of great shows!

5900233,2,B00EAPC860,"Seems like I am in the minority on this one.  While I loved season 1 and 2, season 3 was a hot mess -- and not in a good way.  Cullen went from being an interesting character to being completely one dimensional -- spending his timing sighing deeply, rolling his eyes, and staring off into the distance or up at the sky.  Story dragged so much they ended up filling time with musical montages.  This season also suffered from a complete lack of chemistry with Cullen and any of the female characters.  And what is with the creepy storyline with the young girl?  I noticed that they finally had to make it clear to the audience that she was eighteen.  Overall, a big disappointment.  Ended up fast forwarding quit a bit.",1406419200,,718,4.427480916030534

However, the first 2 seasons were outstanding, did like Ruth's character change to a woman of substance.  The Morman 18 year old wife of Cullen did seem to have some character also.

5900237,3,B00EAPC860,"...and I guess I'm in the minority, I didn't exactly feel the ""differences"" were character growth as much as character divergence, and sloppy. Without giving too much away in terms of spoilers, Bohannon makes key decisions that - only a season or two before - he would have identified strongly against. I'll come right out and say it, so skip my review if you don't want the spoilers: 1) a man who lost everything in the war to (US) government forces suddenly has no problem telling another man and his family he has no choice but to give up his land for the railroad, backed by the very US government that triggered the soulless revenge spree Bohannon went on in the earlier seasons of the series? and then participates in a violent confrontation in which the family is not only forced to move but to suffer the death of a family member in a very grave miscarriage of justice? 2) a man who has lost not just one family, but the possible beginnings of another rolls in the hay with a young girl so short a time after putting the woman who gave him a reason to move on in the ground? 3) after sniping a little with the calvary officer he works with closely to protect the railroad that he will not suffer the presence of Sherman should the general appear, Bohannon then drinks and commiserates with US Grant like they're old buddies? I could accept that it might have been time to let the past go, but these changes were not given an organic development nor were they true to the character we were told Bohannon had by a very heavy-handed voice-over narration in the season opener. I don't want to dedicate my review to skewering this show, because I have enjoyed it very much - but I felt, more than anything, that Season 3 was one-dimensional and even disappointing at times; everyone is plucky, there are no real consequences to anything and more than once the plot develops into an eye-rollingly bad bit of predictable outcome. The gems continue to be Anson Mount, Christopher Heyerdahl and even Colm Meany - who may be the biggest of caricatures on the show, but is just so much fun to watch it doesn't even matter. I hope for this to have been nothing more than a transition into bigger and meatier things for this series, and still look very much forward to S4.",1406160000,4,2267,4.491525423728813

And how could someone get shot in cold blood in front of Ulysses Grant without him even blinking? Almost feels like the writers took a vacation and handed over the script to some amateur. One of the strengths of the serial was its realistic depiction of an important historical period. The season 3 finale leans far from reality, even by the standards of the period depicted.

The entire Third Season was wonderfully written - at times the dialogue had me jetting out of my seat in laughter or I hit the rewind button to hear it again.  Wow!  Anson Mount gets craggier and more wonderful looking every episode - the make-up and hair people on this production ought to get an Oscar!  It's just right - transporting and delightful.  The character arcs on the Irish boys, the Indian whore, her black ""husband"", the newly introduced characters, THE SWEDE (Wow!  Powerful performance which nearly overshadows Anson...

5900305,5,B00EAPC860,"This series was recommended to me, so I'm playing it forward. It's that good! The 19th Century is my favorite time in history and as this show deals with the building of the transcontinental railroad, it's tailor made for me. It turns out, however, that the show is a lot more than that. It has everything! Characters you hate, characters that touch your heart, characters that make you laugh and characters that make you ask WTH were they thinking. Heroes and villains. It's a tasty bit of viewing. If history is your thing (and you can stand a little blood and gore), this is the series for you. I spent one whole weekend catching up on Seasons 1-3 and am anxiously looking forward to Season 4.",1396656000,,696,4.531746031746032

5900311,5,B00EAPC860,Great gritty western flick with a good train backstory.  Would definitely recommend to anyone enjoy well done darker cinema.  HD increases the grittiness,1395446400,,153,5.608695652173913

5900317,5,B00EAPC860,"Anson Mount, as usual, is excellent in this series.  Although he's become, shall we say, less gentlemanly, with women, I look at it as his character evolving.

Human frailties and faults are manifest, the unquenchable desire for expansion is illustrated, and the social mores and attitudes are well defined.

We saw him ride away with the reverends book so i thought for sure he would have a very interesting story line this season surrounding what was in it , so it was like a chunk was missing from the show. Still Anson Mount and Common deliver and kept me half interested in watching",1394668800,,428,4.296296296296297

Similar to Son's of Anarchy only it is set in the 1860's during the building of the transcontinental railroad. Gunslingers, Indians, Calvary, Mormon Settlers, politicians, Union Generals all make appearances in this enthralling action drama. We watched the first two seasons on Net-flix and had to find the third season to satisfy our need for what happens next on this serial. We were happy to read that there will be a new season Summer 2014 on AMC Saturday nights! Does this sound like a trumped up review by some TV AD exec? It's not!

Anson Mount is as hot as a young Sam Elliot or young Clint Eastwood and his acting is just as good as either of them.

5900387,5,B00EAPC860,"Raw entertainment with historical value. Cullen Bohanon is hot stuff. Unfolds how Indian genocide was rationalized and sadly how racism continued after civil war and freedom was granted to slaves. Each episode is thought provoking.

5900388,5,B00EAPC860,Hell on Wheels season 3 gets five stars for its ability to build on the story from the first two seasons while interjecting new problems into the mix.  Season 3 kept the viewers on the edge of their seat and left viewers yurnning for the commencement of season 4.,1390348800,,263,4.36734693877551

We would have finished but had to go to work in the morning.  Not sure what we will do until season 4 starts.  The character development is a big part of the appeal along with the turns that you don't expect.  It is gritty, intense, and captivating.",1390262400,,425,4.197530864197531

5900394,4,B00EAPC860,"In its third season, Hell is still a great way to learn about the history of the railroads and pioneers crossing the plains. The strong characters make it much more interesting than watching a documentary. I love the character of Bohannon and his meeting with presidential candidate Grant. They are two strong men and soldiers from opposing sides of the Civil War. Grant sees the press possibilities from their cooperation. Elam continues as a very likeable character, although I am not sure a black man could have become Sheriff or Marshall in those times, even on the frontier. His lover Eva is either very mercurial or a liar. She is torn between affection for Elam and seeing that their child will probably not get anywhere in society if they marry. The lady journalist is a poor substitute for the spunky and beautiful English woman in the first season. Having traveled several hundred miles off road on old pioneer trails, seen the watering holes (very far apart) and read parts of pioneer journals, I give the series thumbs up for a fairly accurate portrayal of the times.",1390003200,,1079,4.806451612903226

5900398,5,B00EAPC860,"Exciting series, great acting.  5 stars to Anson Mount
Recommend to all Western and railroad lovers. Really
recommend to everyone.",1389657600,,130,5.5
5900399,5,B00EAPC860,"1) The best westerns have that 'John Ford touch', using the natural beauty of the West. I think it exceeds Deadwood in this, but could go farther. Some of the shots have been magnificent.
2) History regarding some characters and the history of the UP vis a vis artistic license excepted. Still, I think there is a good mix of technical accuracy within the show (except the scenes with the trains running like a Ferrari up the track in seasons 1 & 2-The old 4-4's and 4-6's look faster than Professor Fate's rocket rail sled in the 'Great Race'!
""Push the button Max!""
3) Some acting is questionable. Common needs more training. You know, like the good old 'studio contract days'. It would help him. Lee Strasberg School of Acting? Acting coach would help his natural talent. Colm Meaney is of the 'William Shatner School of Over-Acting', but has his moments. His soliloquies are not on par with Ian McShane, so the writers need less of this.
4) I like the anti-PC aspect of the series. Indians need killing! Mormons are 'bad'! Love it. Enough trying to make movies/shows PC. There is the ugly side of all history. No need to sugar coat it for some fool's worry of offending a minority audience. The main protagonist is a good mix of PC, but with a theme of being an anti-hero, i.e., Admitting to lying about freeing his slaves. Getting a Mormon girl with child after a hay-ride...(the old 'Farmer's Daughter' joke was not lost on me).
5) I know the liability issues and expense of westerns. Horses are dangerous (for one example-ask Kevin Costner, who took a bad fall in the Buffalo Hunt scene in 'Dances with Wolves'. He had broken bones-BUT STILL FINISHED THE DAY'S SHOOT). Costs killed Deadwood. Please encourage the continued production even if the high productions standards/values need to be cut. The story has potential and I think a great future. 'Gunsmoke' potential!!!!!!

5900474,5,B00EAPC860,"Love this show.  I have been a fan of westerns and past history since I was a child.  This show tells it like it was.  America was not a pretty place once people left the east coast to move west.  Anson Mount plays his character so well.  He is a troubled sole as most of us would be after our families are taken from us.  The Swede is a sole to be reckoned with.  Oh, we all love to hate him.  Common's character is never dull.  The writers of this show give us rare tv.  Wish there were more late 19th, early 20th century shows to watch.  Can't wait until the new season.",1384214400,,573,3.982300884955752

I lost a lot of interest when a main female character was killed and this last season that just ended, the plot seemed to be male oriented and very political.

5900480,2,B00EAPC860,Too much revisionist history for political correctness. The true history of the building of the transcontinental railroad is dramatic in it's own right without the literary license taken by the screenwriters. Also how did Collis P. Huntington get from the Central Pacific construction site to the UP's end of track? Around the Horn? Isthmus of Panama or across North America where no transcontinental railroad yet existed?  Writers seem to think it was a mere commute.,1383523200,2,468,5.24

5900487,5,B00EAPC860,I watched both the first and second seasons. I love this show. It's a graphic show so keep that in mind. The premise of the show is that the town of Hell travels along with the railroad while it's being built. This is a period drama set back in the mid 1800s. This is a drama based on the history of the railroad that connected american towns across the nation. You're drawn in by the characters and their relationship to one another. Anson Mount is Cullen Bohanen. He's the strong male lead. This is a gritty drama that will have you watching episode after episode leaving you wanting more.,1383350400,,591,4.431192660550459

A some of the Mormon details are a bit wobbly though -songs may be out of their time. I loved the innocence/ignorance and navet portrayed by the travelling Mormon family against the background of the dastardly Viking/swede/Norwegian, although I couldn't  help feeling that the whole episode there was more than unsympathetic -reeks of sect bashing. The evil Mormon settlers were astonishingly! The working girls were lovingly and sympathetically written as befits them. Thankfully no romaticising of their horrendous conditions, but the brutality was out of sun with some of the other char acts who could have been more brutally written. Can't wait for the next series.

However, the Dave Lindley album that may have this song is being sold on Amazon by a third party for $80.00. I refuse to pay that for one song!",1381881600,,303,4.066666666666666

5900562,5,B00EAPC860,"Oh my goodness I love this Season just as much as one and two, I truly hope there will be a season 4.  All of the actors are great, and I'm really surprise with Common he has become a very good actor.",1381708800,,200,3.761904761904762
5900563,5,B00EAPC860,Best show on AMC. Best western in a long long time. Anson Mount is terrific andd should be considered for both the Batman franchise and to play Christian Grey for the movie version of 50m shades of Grey. Though I think his eyes are green.,1381708800,,238,4.311111111111111
5900564,4,B00EAPC860,"Totally engaging, one falls in love with the characters - villains excluded of course. An often overlooked period, the building of the transcontinental railroads, made the newly reunited country whole and gave purpose and employment to a host of immigrants and post- civil war lost souls, including our hero. Excellent concept. Excellent execution. Great show.",1381708800,,360,5.5636363636363635

5900566,5,B00EAPC860,"This series is the perfect mix of historical fiction, action/adventure and good old time cowboy shows.  The idea of the town that moved with the railroad as it expanded west is truly unique. I would highly recommend it to anyone who like this genre. You won't be disappointed.",1381708800,,276,4.75
5900567,5,B00EAPC860,"The acting is superb, the sets are well done, and of course, who could not fall in love with Cullen Bohannon!  Part documentary in that it teaches the viewer how grimey life was when building a railroad.  Who knew a whole ""town"" moved along with it?  I did not prior to viewing this series.",1381708800,,290,4.333333333333333
5900568,4,B00EAPC860,"Final episode was good, but could have been much better.  Also, the length of the ""seasons"" these days is a joke.  Seems like just as soon as they get started they start the countdown to the finale.",1381708800,,198,4.324324324324325
5900569,5,B00EAPC860,Loved the suspense in this season. It kept me guessing what would happen next. I totally didn't expect a lot of what occurred. Can't wait for the next season!!,1381708800,,159,4.517241379310345

5900572,5,B00EAPC860,I really enjoy the old west series. Especially ones like Hell On Wheels because of the historic prespective. Can't wait for Season 4.,1381708800,,133,4.826086956521739

5900574,5,B00EAPC860,"You're there....

The storyline, acting, attention to period detail, all excellent!

Perhaps the best horse movie on TV since Lonesome Dove.

On a large screen in High Definition, it's just awesome.  Can't wait for the next episode!",1381708800,,232,5.1891891891891895

5900576,5,B00EAPC860,"I think the main actor is totally hot and a great actor. All the actors and actresses are great. Story line is fun and historical re: railroad being built.

It's a great tv program - WELL DONE!",1381622400,,193,4.216216216216216

5900579,4,B00EAPC860,I like the story line for the most part but it seems like there is a rush and get the story told which results in the viewer needing to fill in many blanks.. The writers need to slow things down a little and spend more time on the quality of the stories rather than the frequency by which they introduce more drama. There are some really interesting personalities portrayed here and they are the reason I will watch for the next season.,1381622400,,436,4.329268292682927

5900581,5,B00EAPC860,This show is terrific!!  I love the characters and the story arc. Anson Mount as Cullen Bohanan is particularly good.,1381622400,,117,4.85
5900582,3,B00EAPC860,"This season seems to be in a pattern. Bohannan almost gets killed, miraculously recovers, whatever was holding up the RR progress gets solved at the last minute, and there's always the scheming Durant slithering out of a fix. And I hate the pairing up of Bohannan and the 'Church Lady'. Ugh.  But I am always blown away by the superb acting of Robin McLeavy. She is amazing.",1381536000,,374,4.582089552238806
5900583,4,B00EAPC860,"It's getting really goofy. You can enjoy it if your mind is in the frame for Superman or Star Trek. If you are expecting a historically accurate and realistic storyline, you will be disappointed. But it is fun.",1381536000,,210,4.552631578947368
5900584,5,B00EAPC860,"Very well produced show. Like walking dead and game of throws no character is safe. Anson Mount and Common have their shirts off quite often which is awesome. Very good show if fan of other shows such as walking dead,madmen,breaking bad.",1381449600,,237,4.804878048780488
5900585,5,B00EAPC860,"Great story, wonderfully executed by the cast.  Simple to watch or easy to find deeper meaning in the show. Hell On Wheels will be known as a classic series of its time.",1381449600,,169,4.28125
5900586,5,B00EAPC860,Amazing series mixing historical events with a powerful story line.  Keeps you racing to watch the next episode.  Soooooo glad I gave this a chance.,1381449600,,148,4.88
5900587,3,B00EAPC860,It just wasn't up to the previous two years. It was hard to believe he had sex with the young Mormon woman; the Swede and Bohannon should have reconnected earlier in the season; and the final espisode just didn 't feel right. Smoke and mirrors.,1381449600,,244,4.444444444444445

Anson Mount and Common have nailed it!
Highly Recommended!",1381449600,,106,4.35
5900591,3,B00EAPC860,Story becoming overly ridiculous. The Mormon camp turn and acceptance of plowing for Swede is childish. Will not watch season 4.,1381449600,,128,5.142857142857143

5900594,5,B00EAPC860,"The series starts off a bit slow, but as the story develops it just gets better and better. Season 2 cemented it for me. Hell on Wheels ranks right along with Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy as my most highly rated shows over the past years.",1381190400,,242,4.170212765957447

5900597,2,B00EAPC860,"Actually, this season was an improvement over season two. But the finale was so lame and illogical that it ruined the show. The acting is really great though. They need to hire the Walking Dead writers. They don't do lame.",1381104000,,222,4.575

5900599,3,B00EAPC860,Dissapointed. Glamorized and Disneyized. Lost its edge. Love Anson Mount. It was a mistake to kill off Lily Rose in season 2.,1381104000,2,125,4.7272727272727275

5900601,5,B00EAPC860,This TV series is absolutely gorgeous to watch(literally some of the best cinematography ever done). The acting is top drawer and the characters are believable and you find yourself empathetic and interested in their story. HBO's Deadwood is the only other series I can think to compare this to.,1381104000,,295,5.040816326530612
5900602,5,B00EAPC860,"Season 3 of Hell on Wheels improves on the drama and characters from Seasons 1 and 2. Unlike other shows, it doesn't escalate the action to ridiculous levels. Instead, Hell on Wheels stays focused on the drama of the characters and the period - they contend with issues like cholera and drought as well as societal conflicts driven by the characters themselves.",1381104000,,361,4.838709677419355

5900604,5,B00EAPC860,"I think while most folks really enjoy the show they are missing the point. The plot is simply a vehicle for us to watch the characters struggle with moral dilemma. Who is the ""Swede"" really? He is such a Great Deceiver.  Ever notice how each character is associated with one or more of the Seven Deadly Sins? Ever notice how all arrive as a result of some evil they have done? Louise the journalist says to Ruth the missionary - Do you ever wonder how we came to be here? Ever notice no principal character truly leaves except by dying? This is a great show. If you're intellectually curious check out the following. The story of Olive Oatman and the meaning of the chin tattoo. The anonymous poem ""The Hellbound Train"". The short story ""That Hellbound Train"" by Robert Bloch. The song ""Hellbound Train"" by Savoy Brown. And the song ""Hellbound Train"" by Delta Moon. Just type in Hellbound Train or Olive Oatman in Google search. It's 5 minutes worth of reading and you will see ""Hell on Wheels"" working on another level altogether.",1381104000,87,1031,4.603260869565218

5900606,3,B00EAPC860,I LOVE this series - this particular episode of Season 3 is very good and sets the tone.  Unfortunately I could have saved this cost had I realized that AMC was running the full season marthaon leading up to the finale.,1381104000,2,219,4.341463414634147

5900610,4,B00EAPC860,This is such an interesting time in our countries history with the civil war and the building of the railroad which was a huge undertaking and extememly harsh and dangerous work. The cast of characters is  diverse and developing continuously. It doesn't hurt that Anson Mount is easy on the eyes either. I always look forward to the next show in the wild west.,1380931200,,360,4.625

5900613,5,B00EAPC860,"This is one of our all-time favorite series.  Anson Mount is an amazing lead actor.

5900615,5,B00EAPC860,"If you like Clint Eastwood westerns you will love ""Hell on Wheels."" One thing that is wonderful about this show is that it is based upon what really happened during the building of the national railroad system along with all of the death and hardships that the people faced during that time. I have seasons 1 and 2 on Bul-Ray I am also a screenwriter that truly loves great writing and story telling.

If you like season 3, you really need to check out the other seasons as well, especially season 1 where it all began. God, I pray that we will get seasons 4 and 5. The TV ratings have not been as good as they were in season 1. Season 2 saw a drop off as well. I think one of the problems is that AMC have not done enough advertising about the show. Not many people know about the show. I never knew anything about the show myself until I came across a short article in Entertainment Weekly. Even then I thought what a crazy title for a western until I tuned into the first couple of shows. After watching around 4 episodes, I was hooked! Like most people, I am looking for great entertainment while telling a believable story and characters that I can care about. It was not until I bought season 1 on dvd did I come to know that ""Hell On Wheels"" was a real place and so were some of the characters where real people.",1380844800,,1319,4.213438735177865

5900624,5,B00EAPC860,Great series for any western enthusiast ! We saw one episode from season three and loved it so much we had to search for first two seasons to find out what led up to this point. Couldn't stop watching till we were caught up!,1380758400,,224,4.113636363636363
5900625,3,B00EAPC860,"This show really started strong, but with the writer changes over production, the quality has gone down. The acting is still great along the way, but the deterioration of the plot line into scenes that seem to be more developed around Mount being a female fantasy cowboy romp more then anything else. I think killing off the most prominent female lead was a huge mistake, Eva, Church Girl and the new Reporter are not as well developed realistic characters. They rather fall flat, setero-typical, and one is left looking for the lead female role. I think the women characters have been not well written compared to their male counterparts, sometimes they seem to be just plot devices to move the story along and fill a spot for male interaction. The time/location continuity issues are rather hard to miss from a historic or even semi-realistic point of  view. So it seems to come down to selling an attractive male cowboy story in order to keep viewers. However much I like to complain, it does seem to be working from the standpoint of how to sell a show, but it's not good art anymore. It's boring and not going anywhere except into another close call that leads to attractive cowboy fantasies for middle age white women; and as to not be rude and exclude friends, gay men love it too. Sexy cowboys. Mmmm.",1380672000,,1308,4.662337662337662

5900627,5,B00EAPC860,"I watched the first two seasons as a friend of mine told me this was a great show.  I really like it as it is about building the railroad across the plains.  As I grew up in that part of the country, I have always been fascinated by the history of the area.  This series is more of a drama but does have funny parts to it.  The characters have a lot of depth to them.  You think you have them labeled and then you see another side of them.  Anson Mount that plays the lead. Bohannon is really hard to figure out.

5900629,5,B00EAPC860,"Hell On Wheels is a glimpse into an era that isn't usually covered in history books. The convergence of unique characters in one place, all different but all looking for the same basic thing from the railroad: a way to get work, a way to get away from their old life, and maybe a way to get rich out west. And in comes their moral compass, Cullen Bohannon.

5900651,5,B00EAPC860,Hell on Wheels is a beautifully filmed chronicle of a confusing time in American history.  A historical dramatization with incidents that absolutely could have transpired for the actual time period.  Whether or not all is completely fact is irrelevant because you are drawn to the characters and their plights and you care what happens next.,1380412800,,341,5.181818181818182

5900657,5,B00EAPC860,I know this is a fictionalized account of what happened in the building of the railroad - but it has a little bit of everything. The plight of the freed men after the civil war to find jobs with dignity. Irish and German immigrants and their contribution. How women were treated in the Old West - from the ladies to the prostitutes. The defeated Southerners working with the imperious Northerners.

This season we see Cullen Bohannon taking the proverbial wheel. He's in charge of the railroad now, and has to prove himself to the investors in the Union Pacific Railroad project, all the while with scheming Thomas Durant doing everything in his power to undermine him, as well as another old nemesis who makes a surprise reappearance. I'm not sure what's up with the price at the moment, here's hoping AMC lowers it by the time the box set is actually released.",1379894400,,689,4.476190476190476

It shows how after the Civil War, that Americans suffered, life would never be the same, get up and move on, life goes on with or without you.  Your decisions is yours, don't expect a handout.  One's faith can be destroyed, the rich can come tumbling down, only to be brought back up.  Who will win Durant or Bohannon?",1379894400,,392,4.315068493150685

I think it's a good show to watch after the children go to bed. There are some language and sexual issues you may not want the children to be listening to or seeing. You don't actually see any sex but the intent is there for a child to say, ""what are they doing?"" I can't get enough of the show.

5900684,5,B00EAPC860,"Actually, this show has gotten better now that Bohannon's love interest was murdered at the end of season two.  Liked her character during first season but as the show progressed she became sort of a duplicitous witch.  Robin McLeavey is great as Eva.  I have admired her ever since seeing her in the Aussie flick ""The Loved One"" where she totally chewed up the scenery and the other actors as a young girl from a very dysfunctional family.  Kasha Kopinski has stepped forward with a much bigger role as Ruth, the practicing missionary in the camp.  She isn't a lily white character and has failings but she does the best with what she has been dealt.  I'm glad to see Anson Mount becoming a bit more sensitive and his scenes with Kopinski are wonderful.  Suddenly, there are two people on the telly with chemistry.  The plotting has been grand this year and there has been more adventures in the telling.  Especially concerning Mr. Heyerdahl's evil character in relation to the little Mormon boy who has luckily come under the protection of Mr. Bohannon who sees his dead son lurking somewhere in the boy and has a very fatherly way of handling him.  At this point the boy, who rescued Bohannon from dying of thirst, has not told anybody what Heyerdahl did to him and his family after insinuating himself into their company traveling across the plains and I believe by the time he and Bohannon come into each others notice, there just may be more blood than last year's encounter.  I sure as heck will stick around for a 4th season.  Hopefully there will be one.",1379808000,,1563,4.6231884057971016

5900689,1,B00EAPC860,So far it has been very boring. The best season was the first one. The second was done by new writers who seemed unfamiliar with the storyline.

Season three is still running and I'm so glad.  I feel like I'm at Hell on Wheels with them going through their trials and tribulations.  If this is a fairly accurate depiction on how life was when they were building the railroad, how hard it must have been for those folks.  Such a dangerous journey through life.  From being stalked and killed by the Native Americans, sicknesses like Cholera from a contaminated water supply to the ladies of the evening spreading and dying themselves from STD's. Prejudice among the workers.  This series takes you into the extreme conditions in which they lived just to get the railroad built.

I would like them to bring back Joseph(Eddie Spears), and maybe have another Native American get a re-occurring role again, not just some faceless nameless plot devise.

5900809,5,B00EAPC860,"This third season of the post Civil War drama, HELL ON WHEELS, is even better than Season 2; There's a new showrunner, John Wirth, plus outstanding writing and direction by Mark Richards and Neill LaBute and David Von Anken, that has elevated it to high drama and complex character portrayal. The dialogue is intelligent. The facts are authentic. And Anson Mount and Common have developed the two main characters of Cullen Bohannon (Mount) and Elam Ferguson (Common) to complex ones that are both realistic and charismatic. From the first two episodes of the premiere, I realized that the series was better than ever and I am a diehard fan. I've watched each episode of the first five at least twice. Gorgeous cinematography, lots of suspense and characters like Eva (Robin McLeavy), Micky and Sean McGuiness (Phil Burke and Ben Ester), Psalms (Dohn Norwood) and Thomas Durant, played by Colm Meaney make the stories fascinating.. Who knew the building of the Transcontinental Railroad could be so much fun.",1378080000,,1007,5.0359281437125745

Obviously, the ratings are up and the show is doing much better than expected because I only paid $32.00 for BOTH Seas. 1/2 and now Season 3 is the price of a stinkin' movie ticket!!!

5900840,5,B00EAPC860,"This series puts you right in the middle of the action as ""Hell on Wheels"" railroads across the western United States post-Civil War. It is gritty- not for the faint-of-heart who like their western history stories cleaned up and palatable. History is often not that way.

This drama is compelling in its storyline with exceptional characters, and historically accurate. It presents a rare insight into the many varied groups of men and women that worked and lived together to bring the railroad across America. ""H on W"" does not steer away from pulling back the curtain on events that were shameful as it sheds light on the events and circumstances of the times.

When this extraordinary series comes to its conclusion, I do hope the producers and writers continue to bring us more of its kind. It is so rare to find such superior drama and history that is not riddled with gratuitous sex and violence. This is a series I am pleased to own. Well done!",1377475200,2,951,4.688622754491018

His character can say more with one glance than most actors do in an entire episode!  He will go down as one of the most charismatic and appealing cowboys EVER!  What a complex character he plays.  I am not sure if the character makes the man....or the man makes the character!  Either way....I am hooked!  Hope this show lasts many more seasons.,1377043200,,496,4.444444444444445

Common, too, has become a conservative family man, while the old boss, now out of prison, is stirring uo trouble in Omaha, undermining Bohannon at every possible turn and swindling the gullible, sucking their resources into his dreams of a return to power and wealth. The creepy old Swede is back and creepier then ever, and the Indians keep getting the short end of the stick. Something tells me the players and their rolls will twist yet again in unexpected ways before the end of the season. My hat is off to the writers, directors, and actors/actresses, camera crews, set designers & builders, costumers. just everyone involved in this superior production.",1377043200,,797,4.955223880597015
5900868,4,B00EAPC860,"I have to admit,  I was highly skeptical about this whole show after what happened to Lily. But, this episode reassured me that it is still an amazing show. All manner of new twists, and fabulous acting, as always.",1376956800,,214,4.487179487179487
5900869,5,B00EAPC860,Have to say I thoroughly enjoy watching this series and look forward to each and every episode. A welcome change to the reality shows that have suffocated the channels. But as I understand reality is so much cheaper to produce...which is definitely apparent when you watch any of them.....Five Stars to Hell on Wheels!!!!  Only wish there were more shows such as this one!!!!.,1376956800,,376,4.875
5900870,5,B00EAPC860,"One of the best series...close to reality not just a Hollywood ""facts smudge"" ....life was tough in the "" Hell on Wheels"" environment.....building the Trans-Continental railroad was by far more than driving the ""Golden Spike"" as west meets east. Nice to see TV series incorporate real life.....",1376956800,,294,5.276595744680851
5900871,5,B00EAPC860,I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Hell on Wheels. I hope that this will be a series that gets finished all the way through.,1376956800,,124,4.434782608695652
5900872,5,B00EAPC860,"My family spends about two hours in the evening watching TV.  For the last week or so, all we want to watch is Hell on Wheels. Maybe it's the fact that we're southern, and the minute I heard Cullen speak, I turned to my husband and said,""That guy's accent is real.""  (And it is.)  Maybe it's the incredible attention to detail.  My husband, a Vietnam vet is amazed that Cullen behaves like a real person would in a combat situation.  Maybe it's the beautiful clothes, the lovable prostitutes, the chemistry between Cullen and Elam, the holy mackerel good looks of Anson Mount.  All I can say is this is freaking fantastic television at its best.  Go, AMC!",1376956800,,655,4.547008547008547
5900873,5,B00EAPC860,"I am amazed at the quality of the writing, the acting, the photography--everything about this show! It really exceeded my expectations.  Have watched every episode since the beginning. The actors are very good in their parts. Excellent casting. It is like a movie in sections and not a series of episodes. Superb",1376956800,,312,5.0
5900874,5,B00EAPC860,"I kind of enjoyed the first two years...  It's all about a
revisionist view of history, and there's not one
historical fact presented... It's pure ""Hollywood"",
excluding the ""Horsemanship""... The ""Horsemanship,
costumes, and ""tack"" pure amateurish... This is no
""Lonesome Dove"", or ""Open Range""... If ""Lonesome
Dove"" was a ""10"", then this series is a ""1"" or ""2""....
Any B Movie  Cowboy, could out ride,  out shoot,
and capture the ""Spirit of the Old West"",  better
than these ""Greenhorns""... This whole series would
of never made it off the ""cutting room"" floor in the TV
""Gunsmoke"" era... I am not talking about the ""Sex
and Whores"", they may very well be  the best part
of this series... It's Simply Not Believable...  Some
of the acting is pretty good... But the plot, writing,
and storyline, is  so weak, so far fetched, that
it comes across extremely silly, and unbelievable...
It's hard to stay focused, but even with all that going
against it,,, it is still somewhat entertaining... That
is when you put it up against ""Storage Wars"", or the
Amish Mafia...  (Three Star's at Best)
PS: Save Your Money,,, Don't Watch it  in HD,,,
It's not worth it... Save a buck, and just watch in
Regular View...",1376956800,,1202,4.796116504854369

Why is it unavailable???? Can't find out or reach anyone to tell me.  I am adding to this review, once again this week's episode is not available next day. What is going on. I was happy with Amazon until now. The episode IS available on other outlets but I LIKED Amazon and want to stick with you. Please do something about this.",1376956800,,483,4.25
5900876,5,B00EAPC860,I have watched all 3 seasons via Amazon.com and truly enjoy this series.  It has a gritty feel and projects what most likely is closer to what building the trans-continental at end of Civil war was like.,1376956800,,203,4.486486486486487
5900877,5,B00EAPC860,"I am amazed at the quality of the writing, the acting, the photography--everything about this show! It really exceeded my expectations. Funny it's a Canadian show about the American west but it is totally cool and excellent. Anson Mount is perfect as the rebel outlaw and railroad work leader. He could have just been a hunky actor in this role but he can actually ACT and his character, like all the others, is realistic and 3 dimensional. Give this show a try!",1376956800,,462,4.646341463414634

5900880,4,B00EAPC860,"Great start to the 3rd season. I'm enjoying it so much more now that it is focusing on Cullen Bohannon and who he is as a person, his growth. Thank you writers for killing off Lilly, she was an unnecessary love interest in a show that was not meant to be a romantic western.",1376870400,,274,4.092592592592593
5900881,5,B00EAPC860,"It is very nice to watch a TV show that has some reality and history . Great acting and very plot , keep it up go for season 4.

Five Stars",1376870400,,139,3.4838709677419355
5900882,5,B00EAPC860,"So far, Season Three has been letter perfect. Acting is spot on. Writing is beyond superb. There are very realistic comedic touches appropriate for people who have lost it all and now getting it back. Very inspiring work. There is a strong humanity in Bohannon that was missing from revenge filled Bohannon.

And oh glorious day! My beloved Chris Heyerdahl brings back The Norwegian Swede. Not a spoiler. Unless you're totally in the dark about show business machinations or too nave to know what machinations means.

Colm Meany as The Rich Guy I love to hate is even better this season.

Best change so far - the women's roles. When we lost a beautiful woman in Season Two, I thought the next season would be bad. Au contraire! We have two new women who can add so much to this story and easily set up rivalry for Bohannon and Durand (sp?) We also have Elam's wife, aka Tattoo Ho, back. Her acting and dialogue thus far make her a leader, not a mere character.

I am grateful Amazon lets me see this show since medical insurance costs forced me to drop cable.",1376784000,,1060,4.505208333333333
5900883,5,B00EAPC860,"Love this series.  I like the entire cast.  I like the overall story line and the gritty realism of it.  There are very few original ideas left for a TV show, but they hit a home run with this one.",1376784000,,197,3.875

5900886,5,B00EAPC860,"I loved the first two seasons and have watched the first two episodes of Season 3 and yearn to just keep watching.

5900887,2,B00EAPC860,"The first two seasons were so great, I guess regression to the mean has kicked in. No Lily, no Swede, no Toole, and Sean has become a bookkeeper. Even the hookers are all cleaned up, and look like they should be working a Chicago bordello, not a frontier railroad camp. All the frontier grit and grime that consumed the characters and drove some to madness has just gone away, along with the best characters. Thin plots, too. It took Bohannan a whole season to approach Lily, now we find him in a barn trying to hump a teenage Mormon girl he just met because she shot him a sideways glance at dinner. They must have an entirely new crew writing these episodes. Too bad.",1376611200,13,669,4.403225806451613
