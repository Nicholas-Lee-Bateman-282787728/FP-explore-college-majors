1374372,5,B00004YKP9,"What's on this DVD? Dragon Ball Movie 3: Mystical Adventure.
The cover of this DVD is realy nice. FUNimation usually restrict themselfs to a simple screencapture, but this one had more work put into it. As always, it includes the splash with the 'Includes two versions...'. Let's open the DVD. Again, no insert. A little card with the chapters, would be nice. Oh well, you aren't buying it for that ofcourse, but it would still be nice. The DVD itself has the same picture as the cover.
As we insert the DVD, the FBI warning comes op, followed by the FUNimation logo. The menu is simple, yet pretty. We see a picture of Tsuru-sennin (Kame-sennin's rival, and former trainer of Tenshinhan and Chouzu) looking at his giant Dragon Ball Radar. But -get this- FUNi actualy used the Japanese music in the menus! Nice. You can immeadiatly play the film, or first select a language, or scene. There's also extra's. Well, extra's...It's just some commercials for FUNimations other Dragon Ball products. Come on, this can be better.
Let's play the film. I reccomend you select the original Japanese version, for it has the best acting, dialouge and music. The picture quality is great. And I do mean GREAT. For something this old, it cannot get better. Not one rainbow or flickering. Great job, FUNi. The Japanese audio is in MONO, so don't expect the best quality. Still, it's good enough, and after a while, you won't notice. The DUB audio is in Stereo.
Again, Steve ""Daimao"" Simmons translations of the Japanese versions are great. The only problem with the subtitles is that they sometimes move a bit fast, so be prepared to read fast.
Pro's:
-Great video quality
-Japanese version, with great translation
Con's:
-Extra's
Video: 10/10
Audio: 8/10
Extra's: 1/10
Final score(Not an average): 9/10. If you want to see Dragon Ball in all it's glory, get this.",1013644800,10,1849,4.817610062893082
1374373,5,B00004YKP9,"Well, not that I'm a huge fan of Funimation's dub of Dragonball or Dragonball Z, as far as the dubbing itself is concerned, this movie is pretty good.  But, come on, you aren't buying this for the dub!  You want the Japanese version with subtitles.  Frankly, this is Funimation's best DVD to date, and although the sound quality is a bit weak, the quality of the movie more than makes up for it.  So go buy it now!!!",985737600,4,416,4.294871794871795
1374374,4,B00004YKP9,"Despite Funimation's less-than-flawless record on the dub of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, this English version is pulled off quite nicely. For those who don't know, this is Dragon Ball movie #3 (which first appeared in Japanese  theaters in 1988), which is in essence a very compacted retelling of the 21st Tenka'ichi Budoukai, Red Ribbon saga and the 22nd Tenka'ichi Budoukai, squished into about 50 minutes and with a bunch of different events than the main timeline. That's not to say it's not good, though.
Ceyli Delgadillo (the voice of Dende in the English version of DBZ) voices Goku, and does pretty well.  The only downside is that she is much too soft-spoken to play the loud, brash Son Goku, which results in a lot of her lines sounding forced.  Though I initially had thought that Stephanie Nadolny (young Gohan's VA in DBZ dub seasons 3 and 4) wouldn't have done as good a job in the role as Goku, had she been cast instead, the new Dragon Ball series dub has shown otherwise, so... I guess I would have preferred her voicing the main character.  Other than that, the voices were cast quite well. For those of you who are fans of Akira Toriyama's other big hit, ""Dr. Slump,"" there is a cameo of Arale and Gat-chan, which FUNi manages to pull of near flawlessly, especially considering no backstory is given and few DBZ fans (except some of the hardcore otaku) have heard of it.
A nice perk throughout the whole movie is that they use the original music, right down to the opening theme, ""Makafushigi Adventure"", and the closing theme (for this movie, anyway) ""Dragon Ball Densetsu"". It's a refreshing change of pace from the Levy or Faulconer crap that we're subjected to on a daily basis on the English version of DBZ. At times, the music's a bit quiet, but it's still audible, and nowhere near as quiet as it is in the dubs of, say Sailor Moon S or Super S.
This video does have some problems. For one thing, the names of its main villains have been changed. Tsurusen'nin (the Crane Hermit, who trained with Roshi under Master Mutaito) has been changed to ""Master Shen"". Although ""Master Roshi"" was derived from ""Muten Roushi"" (""Martial Arts God, Venerable Teacher""), ""Master Shen"" appears to have been pulled out of someone's...well, you get the idea.  Of course, this also spoils the ""shen""/""Kami"" (God) pun that's present in the 23rd Budoukai (which FUNimation got around by changing the _real_ Shen's name to ""Hero""). Also, T'ao Paipai (a skilled assassin who is hired by the Red Ribbon Army in the series) has been changed to ""General Tao"" (although this was changed to the somewhat more-accurate ""Mercenary Tao"" for the series dub). His signature attack, the Dodon-pa, comes through fine the first time, but after that, he calls it the ""dodon ray"". Of course, Tenshinhan/Tien's attack, the Kikou-hou, has been changed to ""Tri-beam"", but that was expected. General Blue also makes a brief appearance in the movie, and the thing about him is that he was VERY effeminate (possibly gay) in the original, with a hilarious, girlish laugh.  The English voice for this movie is much more masculine, and not as funny (again, this was rectified in the series dub).
There is one odd visual thing that happens at the end of the movie, as well. When the credits come up, they come up half-screen, on a blue background, where only half of the action can be seen. After seeing the DVD, it is clear that this was done to cover up the Japanese credits, but I think Funimation could have done it differently...apparently, they felt so too, because since this tape came out, every other dubbed DB and DBZ movie release has had the original credits shrink down to size so none of the image is lost.
Anyway, it's a good job, but I still got the DVD to hear Masako Nozawa (her name is synonymous with Son Goku... and Gohan... and Goten). I noticed a few things, though... the animation of the opening is altered slightly in the dub (to eliminate the Japanese opening credits) and for some strange reason, the dub's title card is missing from the DVD, even though it was present on the tape. The Japanese one is present, so I'm not sure exactly what happened.
So... if you have the choice, get the DVD, but the tapes are good for at least a rental.",983059200,,4248,4.657333333333334
1374375,3,B00004YKP9,"Most americans aren't quite familiar with the saga before Dragon Ball Z. But everyone knows about it. This saga is more humorous than DBZ is, &  not quite as serious. None the less, most Dragon Ball movies are quite  good. I recommend this movie for those die-hard fans because it is only the  second Dragon Ball movie or tape for that matter, that comes in the uncut  version. And everyone knows, UNCUT IS BETTER!",968198400,6,414,4.554054054054054
1374376,4,B00004YKP9,"You've to buy all of them. Although it's a shame that Funimation isn't able to provide the original Japanese stereo track but it's using only a Mono audio track, the fact that you can still watch the original uncut DBZ  Cell saga is something that any Anime fan can't miss.  Like the Ginyu DVDs  (from the DBZ Freiza saga) released some weeks ago these ones are probably  to be coded for Regions 1,2 and 4 and not just for Region 1 as stated in  the current info ................. . The Androids DVDs are the main  introduction to the Cell saga which represents the Dr. Gero's vengeance  against Goku. If you like sci-fi stories then you'll like DBZ Cell saga and  these Androids discs. Don't miss the Trunks DVDs as well which are just the  prologue to the Androids DVDs and the beginning of the Cell saga itself. By  the time these discs will be released I bet Funimation will have fixed the  glitches and subtitles bugs found on the Ginyu discs (especially the 2nd  one). The DBZ Cell saga in it's original uncut version is finally out on  DVD, don't miss it !",967420800,6,1063,4.44559585492228
7927214,5,B00004YKP9,"Although I have this on DVD, I ordered this so I could make a music video for this movie with the song that played during the credits, Dragon Ball Legend.  Forget what I said about Path To Power being one of my all-time favorites.  It's really in my top 15, and only because the last 20 minutes provide a better resolution to the Red Ribbon Army Saga than we got in the anime.  This movie is a huge improvement overall.  It's easily one of my top 5 Dragon Ball/Z/GT movies ever.",1402531200,,478,4.21978021978022
7927215,2,B00004YKP9,"If you have watched the Dragon Ball series you will realize there is a lot of fails when relating to the actual show. Some of these include, General Blue being called Lt. Blue and Goku saying he got the 4th Dragon Ball from his Grandma. Worst of the Dragon Ball Movies.",1394409600,,269,4.294117647058823
7927216,5,B00004YKP9,I owen all the dragon ball moives and 3 of the boxsets and this was another great moive to the dragon ball series. Uselly dragon ball has alot of humor and action this one only had a few humors parts but not anything to bad. The moive is about when goku and krilln go to fight In there frist tortement while thare chotizs wife is missing and the castle gurds confince him to use the dragon balls to find her but they are relly jest doing it to rule the wrold. Later Goku fights off agenist I forgot his name which was a awsome fight to whatch. This isn't the best dragon ball moive the best one is path to power. Mystical Adneventure is more of a action moive also If your not vary In to dragon ball you might not get this. Over all 5 stars.,1142812800,,741,4.0476190476190474
7927217,5,B00004YKP9,"As a long time fan of Dragonball and Dragonball Z I am excited to see this finally find release in the United States. This movie spins off the early DB tournment saga very smoothly with a short scenic summery of Goku and Krillin's (Kuririn) training under Master Roshi. Their is a lot of good fun and some nice action sequences, including tournment fighting hosted by Chaozu. Familer DB characters are there, including Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha and Pu'ar and some new characters are introduced, including Tien and the aforementioned Chaozu. This is uncut so too suggestive for kids.",1127779200,,578,4.969072164948454
7927218,5,B00004YKP9,This movie was awsome except no normal Goku voice but this movie is cool.,1106265600,,73,4.285714285714286
7927219,5,B00004YKP9,"This was the first feature film based on the original DB series that I watched, and it literally blew me away!  Dragonball Z is always touted as being faster than Dragonball, yet this movie is more frenetic than any battle against Cell, Cooler, Frieza, Lord Slug, Majin Buu, or any other part of the DBZ story.  Speaking of story, this story doesn't quite fit into the original DB storyline (since when is Chiaotzu the emperor?  and since when is Master Shen and the Red Ribbon Army working for Chiaotzu?  And for gosh sake, why is Emperor Pilaf working for the red Ribbon Army!?).  Ah, but who cares?  We get to see Goku and Krillin kick some serious butt here, plus appearances from almost every great villain in the series.  It's a little too frenetic, but it's still a lot of fun.  Plus, we get to see Tien and Chiaotzu's friendship unfold.  But the best scene of all is when Bulma and Launch pose as nuns on a pilgrimage as they try to sneak into the palace to steal the dragonballs.  If you have no idea who these characters are, I suggest you introduce yourself to Dragonball through one of the sagas, but preferably not through this or the other features.  Same goes for my other DB/DBZ reviews, because I'm not going to summarize the entire series for you (check the Dragonball web site for that).  Anyway, this is a great story for all you fans of Goku and his friends.  Kamehameha!",1054166400,7,1392,4.49800796812749
7927220,5,B00004YKP9,"I bought this DVD with some pretty high expentations, and I was totally satisifed! I would suggest sticking with the Jap. version with the english subtitles. The dud was all right but the voice actor for Goku is WAY diffrent then the one who is Goku on Cartoon Network, but the Jap. version makes up for it, that's why it got 5 stars from me.
Though kinda short the viewers see just how close Tein and Chiaotzu's friendship really is. It really doesn't tie in with any story line for Dragon Ball but good never the less.
I would diffently recommend this if you're a Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z fan!",1049155200,2,599,4.357142857142857
7927221,5,B00004YKP9,"Just for the statistics: in addition to the TV series there are several movies of DB and DBZ. (Note: in the Manga books the story just goes on. The Anime is called DB until Goku's getting married, from this point on it is DBZ).
The Movies don't always fully match the TV series. Some charakters do not act as we know them or have different relationship to others. But for everyone who won't mind that, I can highly recommend this movie (Original version, of course. Can anybody tell me why USA releases always try to show the ""good guys"" better and the ""bad guys"" worse than they were intended?)
Oh, and by the way: The DVD I got a week ago was coded 1+2+4!

7927222,5,B00004YKP9,"I recently purchased this DVD based on Amazon reviews and guess what ! They were right.
This is 1 must get DVD. The voices are excelent, whilst it was a shame they had all the voices from the series except goku's, oh well it's still excelent.
Whilst the extras are not much to speak of this movie is as good as the current dbz movies.
With a great story and its good to see an alternate solution to what happens after there training.
The movie does sadden me though as the intro shows many cut clips from the series and i cannot wait for funimation to release series 1 dvd uncut.
None the less this is highly recommended and lets try and get the other 3 movies on dvd
Curse of the Blood Rubies
Sleeping Princess in Devils Castle
and the 10th anniversary special - The Road To The Strongest.
Msytical Adventure, is a fast pace, intersting and funny movie that i highly recommend you add to your DVD Collection today !",1025654400,3,916,4.3313953488372094
