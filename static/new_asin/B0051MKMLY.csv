4524054,2,B0051MKMLY,"DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL. PRETTY MUCH WORSE THAN A B MOVIE. POOR WRITING, POOR ACTING AND A WASTE OF MONEY. THE JUNK THEY MAKE TODAY....",1319760000,2,141,4.2592592592592595
4524055,2,B0051MKMLY,"My mistake, I saw the name John Rhys-Davies on the cover of this DVD and naturally assumed that was a guarantee of the quality involved.  WRONG!  Instead, I should have taken note of another name, Andrew Cymek: writer, director, editor, AND catatonic star of this madness.  The man was almost life-like in his portrayal of a cop out to trap a `wolf'.  The second ""name"" star was William B. Davis (cigarette man on The X-Files).  He looked very old and feeble under the harsh and unforgiving light, I almost felt sorry for him.  Only desperation could explain accepting a role in something like this.
Most of the action takes place in a loony bin/sanitarium/nut house/asylum that would hardly pass inspection in any known universe or time period.  To say it was grimy is to diminish the full horror of its shabby interior.  There isn't enough anti-bacterial hand sanitizer in the world to stave off the germs one would get just standing in any of its dimly lit corridors!  No wonder their staff was rife with idiots, who but a crazy person would set foot in that mausoleum.
As for the poorly plodding plot, it takes forever to get to any amount of action but when it does it's too little too late and assailed by a load of misfired jokes.  Was this a comedy or a horror movie?  It didn't work on either level.  It didn't work at all.  The biggest mystery is how they got any funding for this mess (based on whose credentials?).",1315008000,5,1426,4.545098039215686
4524056,3,B0051MKMLY,"Set in an asylum for the criminally insane, MEDIUM RAW is a dark, sometime humorous, foray into madness.  The plot centers on The Wolf, a notorious serial killer responsible for the murders of 14 young girls.  One of the victim's brother is the cop who finally captures The Wolf.  The Wolf ends up in the asylum and on Christmas Eve, a power outage results in the release of all the inmates who go on a murderous rampage.
Cop Johnny is played by Andrew Czymek, who also wrote the screenplay and directed.  His performance is wooden and bland, sabotaging the film's effectiveness.  Equally abyssmal is Brigitte Kingsley, who also produced, as the doctor who is also Johnny's bosomy estranged wife.  Kingsley shows no emotional range and is often pathetically inept.  X-FILE's Cigarette Man (William B. Davis) is mostly effective as the asylum director who is quite sinister.  The best performances, however, come from the actors who play Mabel, the crazed cannibal and Oliver, the naked foot fetishist.  Mabel's cooking lesson on how to prepare a human souffle is quite funny.
MEDIUM RAW is occasionally involving but its plot twist is fairly obvious.  The Wolf costume is creepy and unique.  Not a classic film, but not a turkey either.",1314403200,5,1236,4.9227053140096615
4524057,2,B0051MKMLY,"The first half of the movie builds the characters and lays the foundation for the film. John Rhys-Davies, one of the ""sell"" points of the film dies early. The movie centers around the wolf killer, a man so dubbed because he kidnaps and kills young girls and leaves a clue, ""Are you the woodcutter?""

There is also an asylum for the criminally insane. We get to meet a number of characters: a woman cannibal, a man who collects toes, and a giant of a man who goes crazy when he sees an infrared light. The wife, or ex-wife of a policeman works there. His sister was killed by the wolf when he was five as well as his partner, more recently.

All the characters are in play at the asylum when the power goes out, and the criminals emerge from their cells. Brigitte Kingsley provided the eye candy and did a nice job as ""the wife"" who works at the asylum. Unfortunately the plot and script lacked. There was a good kitchen scene which should have been darkly funny, but for some reason didn't achieve the expectations. Wait until next month when the used ones hit the market.

No sex, no nudity (okay, some male from behind stuff.)",1313798400,2,1128,4.413461538461538
4524058,1,B0051MKMLY,"I like the idea of this movie. The leading actor who is also the director, editor and writer leave much to be desired, like talent for example. This movie is the definition of ignorable, fall flat horror films.",1313712000,6,210,4.552631578947368
4524059,1,B0051MKMLY,"Seriously this movie not good.  I am not going to say anything cliche like its the worst movie I have ever seen or anything.  Its just good old fashion bad acting.  It is a horror version of little red riding hood. It is simply really bad.  I am giving it a 1 out of 5, only because it was so bad I laughed once.",1313452800,8,312,3.828125

4524082,1,B0051MKMLY,"We watched this because I accidently ordered it (this is what I get for not paying attention to what I am doing) and we didn't care for it.  It had potential but it was difficult to overlook the cheesey acting and horrible ""big bad wolf"" costume the killer wore.  Also, one of the mental patients reminded me of the Hulk...he just sort of busted through a door and sparks flew in the air??  So it was part horror, part mystery and another part superhero??  The only things I did like about the movie was Mable (friendly cannibal) and Walter (loves feet and being in the buff).  Both were not main characters but the movie would have been a lot more interesting if it centered around them as opposed to a cop obsessed with finding his sister's body....oh but then it would have been another movie which would have been an improvement.",1374537600,,833,4.490066225165563
4524083,1,B0051MKMLY,"This was one of those movies that I almost turned off halfway through, but decided I already invested an hour, so might as well see what happens.  The first 25 minutes or so wasn't bad.  I liked the setting of the old asylum inhabited by crazies.  But then it just got dumb.  And dumber.  And dumberer.  Andrew Cymek had no expression and sounded like he had much better things to do than to even attempt to act.  He was bad.  In fact, it was him, and a few of the other bad actors, that ruined the movie.  A poorly written movie can be somewhat forgiven, if the cast owns it.  But this was a joke.  Im sad I have to give it a star.",1369094400,,632,4.016129032258065
4524084,2,B0051MKMLY,"Medium Raw (Andrew Cymek, 2010)

Cymek's second feature, and his only one to date that is not part of the Dark Rising series of horror comedies, is a generic the lunatics have broken out of the asylum (literally) thriller. It's saved from being complete crap thanks to one excellent character, but I'm not sure that pushed it over the line from ""don't bother"" to ""watch this.""

Plot: A number of civilians, through various rather silly excuses, find themselves inside a dark, windowless, nasty asylum after dark, as do some of the staff. A power outage coupled with a computer failure lead to the inmates being released from their cells, forcing the sane folks to try and find ways to survive until help arrives.

Simple yes, and also predictable, as well as being overall badly-acted. The direction is competent, if barely so, and the script (written by Cymek) is nothing special, with a single exception: Mabel (The Rocker's Sandi Ross), a serial killer/cannibal who wants to be your best friend, right up until she eats your eyeballs. Mabel's a fantastic character, easily the best-drawn in the movie; given the characters surrounding her, this would seem to be a case of ""even a stopped clock is right twice a day."" I wish she'd shown up in a much better movie than this. **",1368921600,,1278,4.773755656108597
4524085,5,B0051MKMLY,"I am not sure that I have ever laughed so hard at a movie. Don't even bother trying to guess what will happen next. The plot is so twisted you will never figure out what is going on.  It seems as though the writer took every horror movie he's ever seen and threw it in the mix.  If you like the evil dead series, I'm positive you'll love this.  Simply fantastic.",1364169600,,362,4.070422535211268
4524086,2,B0051MKMLY,"This movie started out great and had such potential, but like many similar films, it eventually falls flat. In the beginning, we are introduced to a killer known as the wolf. Using Little Red Riding Hood as a tool, he's been on the loose for decades. At the same time, we are introduced to a local hospital for the worst of the worst of the criminally insane. This part of the film, was pure genius, as they came up with criminals that are the things nightmares are truly made of. Eventually there is a power failure at the facility and both stories are brought together to make up a rather less than exciting conclusion. The film started out being so unique and tremendous, but eventually becomes nothing more than a slasher film, it was truly disappointing. As for the cast, they were all a bunch of no-names, but they did an adequate job. The really upsetting thing about this film was just how quickly it went from a gem to a turd, it's like the film was written in parts by two separate people.",1361491200,,999,4.434782608695652
4524087,4,B0051MKMLY,"I read the reviews for this movie and most were kind of harsh. So I bought it to see for myself. It wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. I took it for what it was; a low budget horror flick that is just for fun. Jay Reso (wwe superstar Christian) was good, though I wish he'd be in it longer. Horror movies that deal with inmates escaping from a creepy asylum is always good for a few shocks and one of my favorite storylines for scary movies. So, if you want to watch something not too deep and just want to veg out and have fun with a movie, I recommend this flick. It's not going to win any awards, but it's definitely watchable. Believe me, I've seen worse.",1345334400,,667,4.022556390977444
4524088,2,B0051MKMLY,"I watched this yesterday, and have to say that as I become more accustomed to the genre of horror, this movie will definitely not do.  The storyline is weak, the dialog is mostly laughable, and the majority of the acting is on par with a Chiller movie, and Chiller movies are far more rancid smelling than most of the movies run on Lifetime.  This movie isn't horror by any means, so look for it on cable soon.  If it had been a dark comedy I would have liked it better because the woman who played the cannibal, Mabel, was funny in the kitchen scene and it was one of the few bright spots in the entire waste of 90 minutes.  The other notable character, as another reviewer pointed out, was the maniac with the toe fetish.  Both the little girls in this movie were annoying, but the one who played the cop's dead sister was the worst.  You feel no sympathy for any of the victims, and one of the characters working in the asylum is such a creep, you begin to suspect something isn't right about them either and you're proven correct.  If you want to waste your time with this twee excuse of a thriller/horror movie, maybe you will also like the equally putrid Playing House.  You can have a two-for-one stinkfest.  Hey, Netflix, YOU made this one of my top ten recommendations.  Thanks a LOT!",1344038400,,1293,4.394957983193278
4524089,4,B0051MKMLY,"This was a semi-good movie. There were a few moments of humor written into the script and mild violence that made the movie pretty good.  It wasn't overly violent and the plot was decent.  Overall, I didn't think it was a bad movie.",1333238400,,232,4.372093023255814

8452914,1,B0051MKMLY,"Man what a mess... professional actors in a movie written by a congenital idiot. Let's have the hero be a 23 year old cop who's a 120 pounds soaking wet. Let's do the ""serial killers are powerful"" Hannibal Lector crap... no, Ted Bundy was caught in a traffic stop by a lone cop called Bob who smacked the crap out of the little wimp, who was crying, then threw him in the back of the cruiser. Serial killers are angry sissies, we all know that so who can sustain this dumb fantasy. But they are cunning & use stealth/ambush on, usually, women & kids (super tough), that said in this movie one can manage stealth with a dumb giant metal wolf costume - seriously? Ted Bundy's skill was looking utterly normal, in fact, thats the skill all serial killers use but not in this heap of cheesy garbage... apparently you can move around unnoticed looking like dumb Mad Max creation. This is a seriously stupid and boring waste of time... and talent, some good actors in the mix.",1493596800,2,970,4.455056179775281

8452921,3,B0051MKMLY,"Medium Raw: Night Of The Wolf has some really cool elements and some very bad ones. The things that I enjoyed about this film most were eclectic group of serial killers locked within the asylum and the fact that it happens on the eve of the Christmas holiday. There was a big flirtation with the Little Red Riding Hood fairytale between The Wolf and a small child that really should not have been in the facility to begin with. For me the most exciting thing about this film was the smack down concept as the killers are released from their cells forcing the people trapped inside to fight or flee in order to survive.

The few things that fell flat for me in this blended plot structured action/horror flick are simple and only minor irritations at best. First Andrew Cymeks direction and vision for this story was awesome but his portrayal of Johnny Morgan came of a little more comical than I think it was intended. The second thing that seemed to take way from the story was the under utilization of the twisted and dark doctor of Parkers Asylum. William Davis as a sinister figure is commanding. He is evil incarnate on screen and I would have rather seen more of his character as well as the iron wolf suit than all the flashbacks to Johnny Morgans past.

Medium Raw: Night Of The Wolf has a lot of good qualities to entertain. The gore and blood is there and great quality effects. The acting for the most part was believable and the haunting air of the Christmas holiday gave an added darkness to the film that I loved. The soundtrack played out perfect with the scenes and helped to bring the emotion outward. The asylum could have had a stronger story with more face time for the other killers but oh well. The fact is Medium Raw gives us a holiday gathering that only Hell could conjure.",1431216000,,1798,4.478658536585366
