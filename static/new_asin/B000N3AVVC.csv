8174366,1,B000N3AVVC,"This dvd was just slightly informative.  The whole production was done very cheaply and I do not recommend the dvd unless you want to waste your time and money.  You are much better off getting a good book on Min pins that has some quality to it.  The puppy training is just as worthless.  A dvd from the dog whisperer is much better time spent.
