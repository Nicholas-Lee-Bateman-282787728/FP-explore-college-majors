World war love story.
Germans - lights on, at night too???
Too easy, Russkies.",1341187200,,115,4.476190476190476
2321640,3,B0009UKV5U,"Being a fan of military films, I found this movie to have a novel story idea, but poor in execution.  The cinematography was jerky and took me out of my ""suspension of belief"" when watching the film.  I also found the dialog to be very simple and the characters are really just sketches with little depth.  The viewer never really gets to know what is inside the the members of the scout squad; they are just tools for the action sequences.  On the plus side, I did enjoy seeing how the scouts operate behind enemy lines, gathering intelligence.  Overall, I would have to say I was a little dissapointed and am surprised how immature the craft of the Russian film is compared to U.S. or European equivalents.",1309305600,,708,4.543307086614173
2321641,5,B0009UKV5U,"Brilliant portrayal of a reconaissance mission behind German lines by a group of elite scouts (The Star) during the later stages of the German/Russian war of 1941-45 when said Germans were preparing for a major offensive. The realism is at least on a par with anything produced by Hollywood. No English language, but that has its benefits as quite often English translations are in a 'flat monotone' without much emotion, inflection or passion, see my review of 'They Fought for Their Country'. Sub-titles are quite sufficient to enable the non-Russian speaker to follow the story line, and in this movie they are quite accurate translations, unlike those of some Russian movies where sub-titles are frequently just nonsense, see my review of Dostoyevsky's 'Idiot'. In a few words it is a must see for anyone interested in the Russian side of that epic conflict.",1280880000,3,862,5.034965034965035
2321642,5,B0009UKV5U,"The Star took me very much by surprise.  Most Russian films I've seen on WWII seem to come off campy and overly patriotic - in a Soviet/Communist sort of way.  Not so here.  This is a straightforward story of a Russian squad and their harrowing experiences behind German lines - it's a superb movie, very well acted, good story line, and there's nothing dopey or of a propaganda nature in this one.

My major points for this movie come in its extraordinary use of accurate equipment, uniforms, and weapons.  I'm crazy about accuracy in historical movies, and these guys nailed down every little detail beautifully.  If there's any gripe, and it would be minor, it's that the soldiers on both sides are a little too clean and a little too well groomed at times, but that's literally splitting hairs here.  If you're fanatical about equipment in war movies, The Star makes extensive use of correct Studebaker 6x6 trucks (a lot of them) more T-34 tanks than I think I've seen in any recent production (at least a dozen of them if not more) Jeeps, correct artillery pieces, you name it.  The attention to detail on the German side is equally good with at least three or four custom-built Tiger tanks that are much better looking than the ones in Saving Private Ryan.  The German weapons and uniforms are top drawer, and as others have stated, the Germans speak German, the Russians speak Russian, and the subtitles do all the work.

This is an outstanding movie - wish there were more out there like this one.  I HIGHLY recommend this one to any history buff with an interest in the war on the Russian front.",1276732800,17,1604,4.612676056338028

2321645,4,B0009UKV5U,"I had seen some Russian war films while on travel in Asia and was impressed with how well done they were, so I took a chance on The Star and was glad I did.  The story of a reconnaissance team's mission behind German lines is, for the most part, realistically depicted and soldiers, in particular, will enjoy this film.  The degree of accuracy in weapons, equipment, tactics, and movement is very high.  The studio really had some depth of resources when it came to period weapons and equipment.  No doubt, much of this was captured originals.  The tanks - of which there were quiet a few - appeared to be soviet with a variety of detailed visual modifications to make them resemble Tiger's, Panthers, and Mark
IVs.  The actors were clearly well coached in their roles by knowledgeable technical advisors. The action occurs in the woods, weeds, swamps, mud, and streams of eastern russia.  A good use of location far beyond the studio back lot.  The standard compromises for unbelievable daring and heroics, the need to speak loud enough for the audience to hear, and staging action in broad daylight so that there will be something other than shadows for the audience to see all apply, but are dealt with plausibly. Relatively little dialog is needed because the director is up to the job of conveying the story of the mission visually.  You can really tell what is happening in the action and pursuit scenes both day and night.  Good cinematography and a very good transfer to DVD.  There a subtitles, but they are not intrusive.  The Russian language adds to the realism and immersion.  Yeah, it's violent on the R-rated level and not for the kids.  The Russian soldiers are stereotypically heroic patriots.  There are no German characters, at least that live long.  The Germans are depicted as evil targets to be interrogated and disposed of.  Those that are on screen for any time at all are well costumed and acted, but, much as in the Dirty Dozen, they receive little sympathy and are a poor insurance risk. But they are not assumed to fools and prove quiet capable of systematically hunting down team Star.  The use of brief narration to replace the standard enemy headquarters scene where the German staff would react to the incursion and order counter measures is a bit hokey due to the odd translation which is Russian accented English and does not sound like a German battle report, but allows the focus on the team, now on the run, to remain unbroken.",1223510400,27,2464,4.7172897196261685
2321646,5,B0009UKV5U,"By far one of the best Russian  (production) WW II movies that I have seen.  It is straight forward and easy to understand.  The movie does have the version that is avaliable w/ subtitles.  But reguardless, if you can understand any of the WW II movies in any language then this one will speak to you.",1190246400,10,301,4.321428571428571
2321647,5,B0009UKV5U,"This was a wonderful film about a small group of Soviet scouts behind German lines in the spring of 1944.  The film was in Russian Dolby sound with Russian language subtitles available.  I cannot speak Russian and had to go to a website (no URL's in reviews, sorry) and look up the subtitles there.  I hope Amazon lets me get away with this plug, but it is a useful tool to a movie watcher.  I downloaded the English translation of the subtitles and watched the movie twice.  Once while pausing it to read subtitles off of my computer monitor, and once again after having read the subtitles and knowing what was being said.

It was well worth it.  This is no ""Hollywood"" movie.  It is a true story of courage and sacrifice.  There is no plastic 'Hollywood' ending.  There is the real ending.  The one that really happened.

As a combat veteran I give this movie two thumbs up.  It doesn't have that 'hollywood' feeling to it.  Download the subtitles if you can't speak Russian.  It is worth it.  You will understand the terrible thing that is war a little better after you watch this.",1093478400,20,1084,4.482051282051282
8066687,5,B0009UKV5U,"How one reviewer stated very correctly, this movie is about courage and sacrifice, but mostly about duty and love to your country. I was brought up with Russian war movies, but this one is still outstanding. It is so personal, that it touches your soul, as if you know the soldiers personally...And without exaggeration, it was quite common story during war time...Story itself was written by the writer who served in Soviet army as young  scout during WWII, and it is based on true events.",1427500800,2,490,4.764705882352941

8066689,5,B0009UKV5U,"I really enjoyed this movie. I really enjoyed the attention to detail. It was real German/Russian equipment, uniforms, and even language. There were no unrealistic superhuman feats which plagues many Hollywood movies. You pretty much follow a Russian Reconnaissance(Scouts) squad as they collect information on German units behind enemy lines. Eventually the Germans begin to realize there is a Russian Recon squad is their sector and they finally catch up with them in the end. This is one of my favorite war movies due to the realism.",1423958400,2,536,5.172413793103448
8066690,3,B0009UKV5U,Overall pretty good.  Russian cinema is more about the characters than our better-known Western offerings.  Recommended,1420761600,,119,6.375
8066691,4,B0009UKV5U,"Good movie. The love story, what little there is of it, is superflous, and the running scene in the woods is a bit hokey but otherwise great.  Definitely not Hollywooded up, it's cinema as it should be. It's a Russian movie, so don't expect a happy ending.",1417651200,,256,4.446808510638298

8066693,5,B0009UKV5U,"Forget the hollywood dreck.  You know, the movies where ""our boys"" mow down scores of Germans who attack while standing up straight, right into ""our heroic boys"" bullets.  These kinds of movies not only lie to the audience about the combat experience, worse, they cheapen the sacrifice of our previous generations who really had to fight the Germans in WW2.

The one thing to acknowledge is that the Germans were the best soldiers in WW2, bar none.  1944 to 1945, without air cover or any air support whatsoever, they inflicted casualties on the Western powers at the least equal to their own, despite being bombed, shelled and submerged by tank armadas.

The Eastern Front casualty reports make for some sober readings when one compares the losses of the 1944 to 1945 of the attacking Soviets (who at this stage of the war learned much about mobile warfare - research Operation Bagration, the 2nd most important campaign of WW2, second only to Khalkin Gol) to the Germans.

This movie shows the Germans as the well organized, well trained, and, most importantly, smart opponents that they were.

This movie is about a Soviet commando team going across the front lines and raiding deep into enemy rear to discover information about the German force - how many divisions, their numbers and make up.  Is the enemy concentrating forces for a powerful counterattack against the Soviets in this sector - a powerful blow which might catch the Soviets ill prepared and cost many lives?  The commando team's mission is to find out.

The realism of this movie is stunning.

The German tanks look... well, correct.  There is a plethora of equipment that the Germans are using, from (of course) tanks, to trucks, to trains, to horse pulled carts... Which is correct, as a lot of transporting of supplies and ammunition was done by using the old fashioned horse pulled carts.  There is even a kettenrad in this movie.

The Soviet side uses real, actual T34-85, correct from this time period.  They also use American made Studebaker trucks, which is also correct.  And of course, horses, again, 100% realistic for a WW2 movie.

What really stunned me is the small details that the movie gets right, which most people might miss.

Very slight spoiler zone begins here.

There is a scene where, after donning their camouflage smocks and loading up all the ammo, guns, supplies onto themselves, the group is made to jump up and down for a moment.  To Americans, this may seem comical, but this was done of course to see if there was a piece of equopment on a soldier which rattled, made noise, something that banged against something else, or something that might come loose.

Better to notice such a small yet calamitous thing before attempting a stealth mission than during it - hence the ""comical"" jumping up and down.

Second, pop quiz for Americans who have all read the geneva convention and are great humanitarians and send monies to suffering children on various continents.

You are a leader of a Soviet commando group behind enemy lines, and you are lucky (and skilled) enough to capture a ""tongue"" - a live German, whom you may interrogate.  After he answers all your questions, what do you do - let him go, or take him with you, or kill him?

There is only one correct answer for a recce team behind enemy lines, and you can probably infer what it is at this point.

I must pick a bone with a previous reviewer - who wrote that the Germans are ""faceless"".  That is not true - a captured German is a very handsome, normal guy, who is incredibly scared (and who wouldn't be in his situation). He comes across as a normal guy who was unlucky enough to get captured.  You really feel for that German guy, the quintessential nice guy, and the movie shows the true horror of war - the necessity of killing this essentially innocent man to protect the team and the mission.

Very slight spoiler zone ends here.

The technical details, and the actions of soldiers all make sense - but how are the actors and their acting?

Not too shabby, I must say.

There is a slight romantic plot in this movie, but this is a war movie - it is about soldiers sweating, being afraid, suffering, fighting and killing or being killed.  And you can see it in the actors' performances - they are afraid, they struggle in hand to hand with another man, with a grimace of fear and anger, because the next moment either you kill him or the German soldier guts you with his knife.

The Soviet recces (including an Asian soldier - again, realistic for the Soviet Army in WW2) do not go through the motions like the American actors in hollywood movies.  They really do go into the swamp, into the dirt, and by doing so they can't help but bring realism to their performances.  In the quiet moments, there is enough tension, enough gripping drama to make you follow the movie instead of concentrating on your soft drink and cheetohs - remember, the Germans in this movie are not the usual ""movie Germans"" but well trained, well outfitted and smart soldiers.  And they act accordingly.

Everything about this movie is realistic - the equipment, the mannerisms, the uniforms, the tanks, the way the soldiers of both sides behave, talk and joke.

After seeing yet another ""our boys mowed down a score of Germans, who apparently are too stupid to crawl on the ground when under automatic weapons fire"" (might spoil the uniforms, I guess) - you ought to see this movie as a relief from that.",1374624000,11,5449,4.665968586387435
8066694,5,B0009UKV5U,"This is a great movie. Even has some romance in it. But like any Russian romance, everybody dies and there is no happy ending. A little too strong for the kids.",1367193600,2,160,4.193548387096774
8066695,5,B0009UKV5U,"This is a really nice film. Great production values. Good acting. Good casting, in that the actors seem appropriate to their roles, and appear to be the appropriate age. Too often the actors cast as soldiers in war films are too old - and that always bugs me. I will also add that, generally, it is a good story without being too campy. There is a love interest thing going on, but fortunately they do not waste too much time on that and generally use it as a device to build some tension. Based on a true story - there is some artistic license taken - as nothing is known for sure what ultimately happened to this group of scouts, other than what was written in German reports and what was relayed via radio back to their comrades with their unit in the Red Army. A million stories or more like this from World War Two and it is nice to have a few from the Russian point of view, especially some that should appeal to Western audiences - and I mean that in terms of the quality of the actual production and the story. I have a number of Russian films made about the Great Patriotic War (WW2) and this is certainly among the best. If you like war films and/or you like Russian films in general, then I recommend picking this gem up.",1357862400,5,1232,4.246808510638298
8066696,3,B0009UKV5U,"The Star / Zvezda is a good movie to watch and believable action scenes.  Equipment and most uniforms used was somewhat accurate to period.  Not really worth the full price of a DVD in my opinion though.  I would've been happier to have rented this for less than $5.  Kind of a Russian version of Saints and Soldiers, but with a different plot.  Didn't demonize the Germans as much which was good as most Russian made movies about WW2 do that quite often.  Let's not forget how many of his own people Stalin killed and that he also invaded parts of Poland.",1355097600,2,556,4.401960784313726
