5662947,1,B00BOYI9FY,I wanted to like this movie but it's not good. Even though it's been digitally remastered it is choppy. The black and white is way to stark. I didn't like the set. The acting was good. But Shakespeare wouldn't approve.,1392508800,,218,4.475
5662948,3,B00BOYI9FY,Really bad production  Enjoyed watching young Sean Connery He had the perfect accent for the part. Could have used some direction.,1386201600,7,130,5.190476190476191
5662949,4,B00BOYI9FY,"Yes, he is a good actor. This ' 61 television version is a worthy work.
Applause for him and all cast.",1382054400,3,102,3.9047619047619047
5662950,2,B00BOYI9FY,"Although it's fun to see a young Sean Connery, and it's a shorter version of Macbeth, the odd costumes, interminable internal monologues, and dreary staging make this painful to watch.",1374364800,13,184,5.166666666666667
5662951,2,B00BOYI9FY,"This production from 1961 was first produced for television by the Canadian Broadcasting Company, starring a young Connery.  It has been available earlier (before remastering) as part of a collection of ""15 classic films: Great Cinema"" on DVD.  Here's hoping this one really is a better copy.  Nearly two dozen versions of this iconic play are available via DVD in various productions, so choose carefully.  This one is trimmed and moves quickly, with a run time of 85 minutes.  Macbeth is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy, but this film is much less than the ""two hours traffic of our stage"" that Shakespeare mentions.  Brief candle, indeed.",1374019200,24,640,5.105769230769231
5662962,5,B00BOYI9FY,Despite the age of this production (1961) the transfer to dvd is excellent. I have watched a few versions of Macbeth such as those starring Jon Finch and Sir Ian McKellan and found them slightly better due to them being a more modern version. For those with a sense of curiosity in terms of seeing Sir Sean Connery playing Shakespeare I would highly recommend this dvd despite it being an abridged version. Watch and enjoy..,1463270400,3,424,4.666666666666667

5662964,4,B00BOYI9FY,"If you have seen the early Avengers episodes with Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale you know what to expect - 4x3 format, black and white, low resolution, way-too-dark. Once you get past that, you can see that Connery was serious about his acting and manages to make this production watchable. The director has done this in a naturalist style: no one tries to look like they are saying poetry, and Connery demonstrates a wide range of emotions which many productions of Macbeth miss. If you think Shakespeare is sacrosanct and his plays shouldn't be cut and should be done in a declamatory style, you will not like this. If you can get beyond the crude single-set stage and lighting you'll find a vibrant and fascinating production.",1459296000,4,727,4.777777777777778

5662969,3,B00BOYI9FY,great movie,1448064000,,11,5.0
5662970,5,B00BOYI9FY,"In this particular version of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", the estimable thespian capacities of Sean Connery are on display in ways that may strike many viewers agape in its complexity and simplicity.

Connery's incarnation of the tragic, doomed and utterly mad Scottish Warrior's descent from grace and honor into a moral labyrinth of evil and vice serves to underscore Connery's deft acting ability, as he gracefully maneuvers through one of Shakespeare's most difficult roles with believability , charm, malice, rage and decadence that always feels convincing, uncontrived and reliably riveting, beyond any fault.

This film--shot virtually one year before Connery's ascent to the role of British Secret Service Agent James Bond for Ian Fleming, which heralded his place as an international film icon for the remainder of his life---is a sensational showcase of Connery's full breadth and scope as a master performer that would (quite literally) never be given the same sort of challenge again, for virtually the remainder of his career.",1446336000,,1036,5.46875
5662971,5,B00BOYI9FY,thanks my friends,1444953600,,17,5.0
5662972,4,B00BOYI9FY,"Very interesting video-taped stage production of young Connery in a nice turn as Macbeth.  His interpretation, stacked up next to Welles and others, is exceptional for a young actor.  And, it's nice to hear the accent at this stage of his life!

Supporting cast very capable.  Video quality, camera work pretty distracting.",1443052800,,323,5.153846153846154
5662973,2,B00BOYI9FY,"Good movie, but picture quality is very bad. I could not use it in my classroom.",1437350400,,80,4.0625

5662975,4,B00BOYI9FY,"Though difficult to understand in places and filmed in a dark environment, it is a must for those teachers and an instruction on Shakespeare. Sean Connery fans will delight in a pre 007 as Connery fights through the language of the Elizabethan Era.",1434240000,,248,4.790697674418604
5662976,4,B00BOYI9FY,"I don't think this is useful for teachers. there are no scenes to select and no bar at the bottom to move to a specific place. If you have the know how/equipment to mark places to jump to it is worth buying. Sean Connery delivers the lines well. The set is minimal but I especially liked the scene  with Ban quo,  Macbeth,and Fleance.  Connery's acting and the directors choice to have the boy climb all over the thrown helps the viewer get the sensation of Macbeth s obsession with Ban quo's progeny sitting on the thrown.",1428796800,3,523,4.427083333333333
5662977,4,B00BOYI9FY,"Considering the source, the HD Instant Video version was quite good. Viewed on a Fire TV device, this version has captioning, which I always find helpful due to sound recording quality as well as following Shakespeare's language.
The sets and costumes seemed reminiscent of Orson Welles' Group Theatre productions of the Depression era--somewhat expressionist and severe. I found them appropriate for this televised production of the play.
As for the acting, it was solid and workmanlike from most of the characters. The leads were interesting (as other viewers have pointed out, especially for the pre-Bond Sean Connery). His virile demeanor and youth paired well with the more mature-looking Lady MacBeth of Zoe Caldwell (whom I had the privilege of seeing on Broadway as the original Miss Jean Brodie and a mesmerizing Medea).
The use of over-dubbed unspoken thoughts by the actor always seems an unfortunate choice to me since it leaves the poor actor to pantomime what he would be more comfortable just speaking outright. These were the moments Sean Connery appeared most ill at ease in the role. Otherwise he did a surprisingly compelling job for an actor not known for Shakespearean roles.
The cuts to the play were not awful since the story line was clear and it moved swiftly to its inevitable conclusion. No one needs the parade of future Scottish kings segment during one of MacBeth's later visits to the 3 witches these days. Overall it is a good introductory version to the play.",1427587200,5,1492,5.020161290322581
5662978,2,B00BOYI9FY,"We had to abandon the movie after about five minute.. The cinematography was so dark and full of contrast that it was not easy to see what was happening. More important, subtitles were not available so it was even harder to hear what was happening.",1427241600,,248,4.533333333333333

5662980,5,B00BOYI9FY,"one of the best versions of Act 5, Scene 5 I've ever witnessed ""... It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.""
Mr. Connery's accent lends some additional credibility to the role - and makes it more
difficult to follow too, unfortunate but worth the vibe it gives the role.",1426118400,,305,4.368421052631579

5662984,3,B00BOYI9FY,"A time capsule of television drama of the early 1960s and a way to see how Shakespeare was staged & performed for a mass audience. Sean Connery fans will, I believe, enjoy the trip back in time, while others may be disappointed in the staging, costumes and acting. As it stands, it's at least interesting to see how TV attempted to educate and entertain in the mid-century modern era.",1420243200,,384,4.579710144927536

5662989,2,B00BOYI9FY,"I gave this two stars for the editing and rather wooden performances contained therein. Obviously shot for tv, the story is recognizable but lacks the entire play's lines as they should be performed. At best, a beginner's Macbeth not for the true afficianado.
It is a good example of why those who would edit the bard should beware.",1400630400,,332,4.741379310344827

5662991,3,B00BOYI9FY,"Even though it has been digitally restored it is still not an easily followed production due to kinescope-like filming. I watched this just to see Sean Connery in this production, but it doesn't do justice to the great Mr. Connery.",1395187200,2,231,4.8
8571989,2,B00BOYI9FY,"I found the print quality and the sound disappointing. There are no film credits. Whole scenes were omitted.. Connery's performance was adequate but not special. In his interpretation of the  ""out brief candle"" soliloquy his timing and stress seemed ""off"".  There are definitely better film versions of this play.",1509840000,,313,5.36734693877551

8571993,2,B00BOYI9FY,"Perhaps the worst production of macbeth i've seen.  Interesting to watch young connery, but acting, editing, video quality and set design were all terrible.  The DVD itself was fine; if you're particularly interested in this production, or a completist like me, it's worth a look, but if you just want a film version of macbeth, go for the globe's recent production, or the cotillard production, or even the polanski version before you go to this one.",1485302400,2,451,4.921052631578948
8571994,2,B00BOYI9FY,"MacBeth is one of my favorite Shakespeare Plays. I qas quite disppointed in this rendering. It was interesting to see Sean Connery as a young man prior to become world wide famous as .007. His talent was clearly apparent even in this production. If this was a remastered version, I hesitate to guess at the condition of the original. The minimalist values caused the presentation to be disjointed, uneven and at times confusing. The witches were not traditional, which isn't necessarily bad; but was in this case. Trying to be creative with the master of creativity is a mistake. I'm saying no more about this particualr production other than, if you are a MacBeth fan, watch it for perspective and to enlarged your MacBeth database. If you're not a fan and want to feel the best experience, I would start with Orson Wells' version, then Throne of Blood, and possibly Barrymore. I've always hoped Branagh would do one.",1484784000,2,918,4.8164556962025316
8571995,1,B00BOYI9FY,The witches were too pretty. The dialogue was too fast.,1473033600,2,55,4.6
8571996,2,B00BOYI9FY,"Interesting to see Sean Connery do Shakespeare. A typical early 60's condensation of the play for filming, with simple scenery, dramatic music, black & white filming, little choreographic complexity. Contains all the essential elements of the play. Connery is good as Macbeth, not great. But few can do Shakespeare naturally, withput sounding like a recitation.",1470787200,,361,5.581818181818182
8571997,3,B00BOYI9FY,"The performances were rather good with exception of the witches, who were terrible, but I was not impressed by the minimalist sets. The stark lines did not add anything to the overall feel of the film.",1463788800,,201,4.611111111111111
8571998,2,B00BOYI9FY,This is a great play but I could hardly make out what the characters were saying.  It was in black and white and in today's digital world it did not capture my attention nor would it keep the students I was previewing it for engaged.,1463356800,,233,4.177777777777778
