1409381,3,B000059TFI,"I remember when BUSTER came out and I was always surprised at how Hollywood enjoyed proclaiming that it was a bomb.  Especially after it turned into a pretty nifty film.  The soundtrack was cool, the story was based on a real life robbery (there's actually a film that plays the same robbery as gritty heist film, so that would be interesting to see as far as cinematic styles go), and everyone was very good in it.  The Sixties feel looked authentic--are there parts of London that will be forever locked in the 1960s?

But I also knew that Phil had a bumpy ride in Hollywood.

When his awesome song, ""Against All Odds,"" was up for an Academy Award, Phil planned his entire tour around making himself available for the Oscars that spring...only to be told by the Academy that only ""movie people"" would be doing the songs.  Like Stevie Wonder.

Apparently, Little Stevie hopping around in the BEACH PARTY movies in the 60's qualified him as a ""movie person"" and he was allowed to sing his monotonous ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" from THE WOMAN IN RED.  Phil got to watch Ann Reinking butcher his song in an overblown production number while squirming in his seat.  (The letter telling him he wasn't needed was even addressed to ""Phil Cooper,"" to add insult to injury).

""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" ended up winning, and Stevie then said he didn't write the song for the film (effectively disqualifying it for the Oscars), he wrote it for Nelson Mandela.

When Phil told Rolling Stone, ""He's blind, he's black, he lives in L.A.  Of course, he was going to win,"" you would've thought Phil flew down to South Africa and did a MIDNIGHT EXPRESS-styled beating on Mandela.

So I kind of wondered if Hollywood was posioning BUSTER's reception in the States.

I liked it.  While so many movies allow audiences to fantasize about how they can make a big score through robbery and then be rich, BUSTER pops that balloon by showing that, even when the robbery is a success, the aftermath is still wrought with uncertainty and danger.

So all's well that ends well, I guess.  Phil's won an Oscar for the Tarzan song.  He may have won another one, for all I know.  I just saw him on tour last year and he still has a funny sense of humor I first saw back in 1985.

And BUSTER is on DVD.  Give it a shot.",1115078400,12,2301,4.443914081145585
1409382,5,B000059TFI,"I was so happy to find this in American format - I'm a British expat and was thrilled to see this again.
The Four Tops on the soundtrack is wonderful!",1060992000,3,150,4.033333333333333
1409383,5,B000059TFI,"I'm so glad this video is being reissued, not only because I'm a Phil Collins fan, but because it's a great movie in general.
Phil plays Buster Edwards, who may be a thief by profession but whose real reason for living is the love of his wife June (Julie Walters) and his daughter Nicky. After pulling off the biggest train robbery in British history, Buster flees with his family to Mexico, along with the ringleader (Larry Lamb), and his wife.
What starts out as a vacation in paradise turns into tensions boiled over when an argument between June and Buster gets physical (he slaps her face) and she retaliates by taking Nicky and flying home.  That's when Buster realizes that living in exile is pointless if it means alienating his family.
All in all, this is a very moving, heartwarming film (which includes one of the best robbery sequences I've ever seen); it gets the R rating for some of the more violent scenes, brief nudity, and the occasional British curse word.  The score by Anne Dudley is as beautiful as some of the film's most tender moments, and the songs in the soundtrack include two of Phil's biggest hits: ""Two Hearts"", and ""A Groovy Kind of Love""; as well as such classic tunes as: ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny & Cher, ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"" by Dusty Springfield,""  ""Keep On Running"" by the Spencer Davis Group (with lead vocals by a then-relatively unknown singer and keyboard player named Steve Winwood), and ""How Do You Do It?"" by Gerry & the Pacemakers",989280000,17,1497,4.5783582089552235

1409408,4,B000059TFI,"While the story doesn't always hold its own, it is clear that singer/musician Phil Collins makes an impressive movie debut. Chronicling the exploits of the famed London Train Robbery in the 1960s and focusing on lifetime thief ""Buster"" Edwards (Collins), the film jumps back and forth from comedy and drama with out much consistency. It's still a good and enjoyable film to pass the time.",1398038400,,388,4.984615384615385
1409409,4,B000059TFI,"British pop legend Phil Collins ""makes an impressive acting debut"" in this ""endearing"", award-winning* European comedy/drama flick about love, life and family on the lam.

""Tinged with scruffy, good-natured charm"" (Box office) and the Collins hits ""Two Hearts"" and ""Groovy Kind of Love,"" Buster will steal your heart! Based on actual events surrounding ""The Great Train Robbery of 1963"", Buster follows the exploits of a lovable husband and father who provides for his family by stealing!

Wanted for his involvement in one of the most daring robberies of all time, Buster Edwards(Phil Collins) must pack up his clan and hightail it to Mexico, but when his wife June Edwards(Julie Walters)grows tired of the sunshine and margaritas and moves back to England, Buster faces a tough choice by remaining a free man in Mexico or to go back & face the music in London so he can one day be with his family again with a heart-felt conclusion.

BUSTER takes me back to memory lane to when I was 16 years old in my Sophomore year in high school during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1988.",1386547200,,1085,4.791443850267379

7934148,4,B000059TFI,"This film was under-appreciated and didn't receive favorable reviews by critics. I must say, I thought it was very good, and very factual. The story is about a career thief who lives in south London who connects with other criminals to form a gang and rob a Royal Mail train north of London. ""The Great Train Robbery"" has produced films over the years, but this movie focuses on one member of the gang, Buster, played by Phil Collins. Buster and the Gang recruit a former train engineer/driver and figure out a way to stop the southbound train, then steal all the bags of cash inside the carriages. They carry out their plan, steal millions of British Pounds, and disperse after hiding out in a nearby farm they rented. Buster and the leader decide to go to Mexico, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with Britain. They both live there for a few years, then Buster's wife misses her family and home. He decides to join them, and gets caught, as do most of the train robbers. He serves his time, gets out, then runs an honest flower stall on the Thames river, where the story ends. It is very entertaining, very accurate and the storyline goes well. I highly recommend it.",1508371200,,1177,4.5829383886255926

7934152,5,B000059TFI,"I'm the 13th person to give this film a Five Star Review and the 17th overall to review it. The opening scene of this film explains exactly who Buster Edwards is--a career criminal who struggles to support his family.

For years I owned the soundtrack of this film but had never seen the film. And while I'd heard of The Great Train Robbery, I never knew that this film was a film that depicted those events of 1962. I was amazed at the sheer size of the crew. I also liked how they did not double-cross one another once they made their score. What's also ironic is how they wanted a ""cleaner"" to come and scrub behind them for their prints. Today (Meaning The Last 20 Or 25 Years) criminals would simply have burned the barn down to the ground. That would have dealt with all of the evidence then and there and would have given the crew time to escape England or lay low until things blew over.

This was a great film and while there are others on this fantastic heist this was the first one I saw. The music is superb and will put you in the mood for the 1960s. Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I'd been waiting for this to come out on DVD for 10 years. Finally it's here.

7934153,5,B000059TFI,"I remember the great train robbery and the cult following the culprits enjoyed in and around the East End. We all knew that Harold MacMillans government went after them ""Gangbusters"" to blow smoke in the collective faces of the electorate to cover up for the Profumo Affair. The old lags who pulled off this job were well known but were surprised at their sophistication. Had it not been for the unfortunate harm that was done to the train driver, the gang might have had a legitimate cult following. Phil Collins plays Buster Edwards most convincingly. A wonderful retelling of the Great Train Robbery and a very convincing East End of the day. The movie was very well packaged, arrived in wonderful condition and very promptly.",1459036800,,729,4.84
