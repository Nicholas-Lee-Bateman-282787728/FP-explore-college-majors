352577,1,6301777387,"Upon watching this awful film, I was suprised that such a dissapointment spawned such a great sitcom.
First, M*A*S*H has NO plot. It is litteraly just like a bunch of episodes -- and bad episodes at that -- stuffed into  one long, boring movie.
The boring dialougue never seems to end. And to  use the ""b"" word yet again: in general, this movie is  BORING.
There are hardly any dramatic elements. None memorable anyway.
This has to be the worst video I have ever rented. I reccomend staying  away from it.",921283200,23,505,4.516483516483516

352757,5,6301777387,"The movie was interesting, when you realize it was originally projected to be an anti-war film about Viet Nam, but politics were that they weren't allowed to VN ,so they did it about Korea but with allusion to VN.  Sally was the best.  Technically my HDMI was making the big screen blink with static noise so I played with the % of screen size and other display settings that eliminated the blinking problem?  It seemed like the reality is stranger than fiction.  For $4, we got what we wanted when we wanted it.  I also don't recall it exactly but it is what it is.  I didn't like that they seemed to ridicule religion, which provides solace to so many.  The TV series actors were not as funny, but still good enough, TV series also way over did the Sec 8 Kilinger thing.  They probably shouldn't have showed the other football teams players smoking wacki weed.",1520380800,,862,4.480769230769231

352759,1,6301777387,"The fact that this was made in 1970 is probably what is causing my disappointment in this film. It was HYSTERICAL and groundbreaking at the time of its release. This type of humor is no longer relevant or funny. The movie is sloppily cut and bounces from one short scene to another in quick spurts. The story seems to have no continuity what-so-ever. One minute the characters are stitching someone up and the next (I mean LITERALLY the next minute) they are in a jeep making weird sounds.
This movie did not hold up well over time and isn't worth watching.",1520121600,,557,4.524752475247524

352879,1,6301777387,"I'd always heard what a classic this movie was. I knew that it was much different from the television series and went into it with as much of a blank slate as I could. However, this wasn't just a matter of it being different, it was a bad movie on it's own. The acting is about the only positive I can give to this.
It lends itself as a satire and a dark comedy with no real goal as to what exactly it's satirizing and the comedy not so much dark as stale takes on stereotypes. By an hour into the movie I was having a hard time watching if only to see the direction it was going and found myself sympathizing with Houlihan.
Honestly, the entire thing came across like a filmmakers first project in school where he tries to seem edgy and cool and like a real artist, but just comes off like a real a-hole. I'd say it was a problem of the movie itself, but I've seen that the book's author loved it so I think it speaks more to just the type of person who enjoys this sort of thing. Unfortunately, that kind of thing is so pervasive that it lends to people calling poorly done movies classics like this.
Really, this whole thing isn't worth it and I'm a worse person for having seen it.",1506816000,,1185,4.134199134199134

353012,5,6301777387,"Mash

Robert Altman's classic anti-war satire from 1970, using the Korean War 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital as its focal point, as a metaphor for our involvement in Vietnam.  The movie was made almost 50 years ago, and withstands the test of time, if one understands the backgrounds of the Korean War depicted and the Vietnam War during which Mash was filmed. The first rate cast includes Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt, Elliott Gould, Robert Duvall, and Sally Kellerman, all of whom went on to very successful acting careers. A younger audience may find the film irreverent, sexist, homophobic, crude...but must understand the film is a work of satire, and focuses on young drafted doctors (who really don't want to be there) who are skilled/professional at what they do, and when time comes for play, they play hard. Mash the movie, is a completely different animal than the TV series which it preceded.

 Altman's Mash uses rapid-fire overlapping dialogue, that demands one pay attention. He gave his actors latitude for improvisation and ad libbing that veered from the script written by Ring Lardner, thus producing more naturalistic performances. The studio wanted the operating scenes (gory and rather graphic) on the cutting room floor, but Altman refused. The ""backstory"" the making of Mash on this edition fully describes the chances Altman took, the doubt in the process expressed by the studio, as well as some of his actors, and how he tied the whole production together. Mash, was a very low budget film that broke the mold, and was the vector to stardom for many of its actors, and Altman himself.

Mash is an anti-war satire. The word satire should forewarn viewers that toes will be trod upon. Though billed as a comedy, the operating scenes solidify the senselessness of war message Altman wanted to convey. In that respect alone, Mash is timeless.",1499904000,2,1874,5.012861736334405

353366,5,6301777387,"As compared to the TV series, the original MASH was obviously more geared toward everyday reality and the gritty side of humor when it came to war. It is important to be able to distinguish that fact versus the TV series itself which was geared more toward looking specifically at the comedic side of things in general. This Original theatrical release was relative for the time and those especially who had served. Though the time period remains somewhat misunderstood, MASH bridges that gap and remains a keepsake to those who understood this time period even when others didn't. Now for a look at the flip side...

MASH S1EP23 ""No Turnip Left Unsqueezed""

Synopsis: The MASH unit hilariously tries to deal with a supply shortage.

INT - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Hawkeye, BJ, Frank, Hotlips are operating on patients along with a few assistants.

Hawkeye: Dammit! Looks like we're going to need a pint or two to compensate.
Clamp.

Nurse 1: Clamp.

Nurse 1 hands Hawkeye a clamp. Hawkeye has a moment of delay.

Nurse 1: Yes, Doctor?

Hawkeye: Yes? To what? My after hours proposition or am I just that
obviously tired?

Frank: Oh, would you just wake up Pierce!

Hotlips laughs, much to Franks surprise.

Hotlips: Good one Frank.

Frank: Why thanks lovey dove.

BJ: Look out Hawk, you've got competition.

Hotlips: Finally, some REAL humor around here for a change.

BJ: (To Hawkeye) I don't think she meant yours.

Hawkeye: Insult gladly accepted Margaret. The day something
finally happens around here with Frank will be the day we can all
finally get some sleep.

BJ: I'll know I'll be laughing in mine...

Frank: Ha, ha.

BJ: ...or crying.

Nurse 2 walks in.

Hawkeye: Nurse, give me two pints AB negative.

Frank: AB negative?!

Hawkeye: Don't wake me Frank!

Frank: You know that's in short supply!

Hawkeye: And so are the people waiting in line to use it.
Stat!

Nurse 2: Yes, Doctor.

Frank: You know, if we're going to use supply like this we're going to have
to start making sacrifices.

BJ: As if we haven't been already?

Hotlips: (To Frank) What did you have in mind?

Frank: I don't know. Maybe donating more blood?

BJ: Sheer genius Frank.

Hawkeye: Great. We'll start with our Turnip rations. All in favor?

Frank: This is not a laughing matter!

Hawkeye: It might not Frank, but you on the other hand are very laughable.

Frank: I am?

Hotlips: (To Frank) That wasn't a compliment.

Frank looks dumbfounded.

Frank: Oh.

Hotlips: ENOUGH. We'll look into finding some volunteers later.
Ok? Frank?

Frank: Yes. That's right. We'll look into it later.

BJ: Anybody we know?

Hawkeye: Frank?

Frank: What?

Hawkeye: I know your AB negative, but I haven't been seeing you stand
in line lately.

Frank: Well, uhm, I've been busy.

Hawkeye: Yea?

Frank: I'm a senior officer. I'm needed.

Hawkeye: (To BJ) Yes, I agree. It's good to be needed.
Don't you think?

BJ: Oh, yes. It's very good to be needed.

Frank: I've got to stay up long hours.

Hawkeye: long hours, yes.

BJ: I know long hours.

Frank: And to oversee everything.

Hawkeye: Everything.

Frank: And the stress.

Hawkeye: We know about the stress. By the way, do we know
about stress?

BJ: I'm afraid we do.

Hotlips: All right stop it you two. (To Frank) Don't reply Frank.
They are just egging you on.

Hawkeye: I think he's egging himself just fine. (To BJ) Don't you?

BJ: Lots of egg, yes.

353368,1,6301777387,"I'd never bothered to watch the film MASH, having grown up with the television series. Well, they are two entirely different birds. This is the realist anti-war film I've ever seen. It's fascinating to watch how patriarchy revises itself from one generation to the next. Which would you prefer? Conservative military authoritarian patriarchy or left-liberal counterculture patriarchy? Oh, I don't know, but if you're a woman, it sure doesn't matter!  Don't forget to have the Asian boy bring you your martini while you're waiting for the nurses. This film reveals the racism and patriarchy that underscores U.S. imperialism.  Donald Sutherland's performance is stunning. Hawkeye is a demon. He keeps Hawkeye's scathing contempt for everything around him just beneath the surface, and makes him wield his white male privilege to anarchist means with no ends. He gives new meaning to the term ""blue eyed devil."" And he knows he's no good, too...What a frightening, brilliant, exhilarating film...",1478217600,,994,5.365384615384615

A new nurse arrives and conspires with a doctor to bring down military discipline upon the camp. The nurse and doctor have a physical relationship which is broadcast over the camp intercom. Also aspires to be funny with inept intercom announcements.

A doctor feels he has an ailment and it needs to be treated. A bet is made on weather the carpet matches the drapes, unable to be seen by camera. Concludes with a football game, where they come up with full equipment is unknown. Some swearing and military/hospital bloodshed. So uninteresting I watched only the trailer which was included. did not watch any of disk two which includes a 'Making of' documentary as I could not have cared less. Unfunny, felt like high school pranks, perhaps this is what happens on the war front due to boredom and tragedy. Includes the words to the theme music.

354111,5,6301777387,"If you are only familiar with the hit television series ""MASH,"" then you might want to watch the original 1970 motion picture on which it's based. M*A*S*H, the movie, was pretty daring for its time and continues to be one of the best antiwar films ever to come out of Hollywood. Familiar with the movie or not, you may find the Blu-ray edition does it up right, with good picture and sound and plenty of bonus materials.

Upon first viewing this film in a theater, I enjoyed its black humor and antiwar stance, but I wasn't prepared for all the blood of the operating room. We didn't see this much blood forty-odd years ago even in horror flicks. It took me a few more viewings to understand the importance of those grisly scenes, to see that this may have been a funny and entertaining look at war, but it was also a realistic look at war. The blood brought the story back to earth, back to the harsh, grim realities of death, where people didn't die cleanly as they had in previous war movies but died blood-soaked and miserable.

Screenwriter Ring Lardner, Jr. and director Robert Altman based their movie on a comic novel by Richard Hooker. The Vietnam War was at the height of controversy in 1970, and Lardner and Altman wanted to make sure their audience saw the connections between the fictional senselessness of their 1950 story in Korea and the real-life senselessness of Vietnam and all wars in general. Altman said he was trying to couple that with comedy in the worst possible taste, comedy about death and dying, hypocrisy and suicide.

The filmmakers divided the wildly uneven and highly episodic plot into six major sections. The movie's first section is our introduction to the characters. The ensemble cast, encouraged to improvise as much as possible, couldn't be better. Donald Sutherland stars as Captain ""Hawkeye"" Pierce; Elliott Gould is Captain ""Trapper"" John McIntyre; Tom Skerritt is Captain Duke Forrest; Sally Kellerman is Major Margaret ""Hot Lips Houlihan; Robert Duvall is Major Frank Burns; Jo Ann Pflug is Lt. Maria ""Dish"" Schneider; Ren Auberjonois is Father ""Dago Red"" Mulcahy; Roger Bowen is Colonel Henry Blake; Gary Burghoff (the only carryover to the TV series) is Corporal ""Radar"" O'Reilly; and John Schuck is Captain Walter ""Painless Pole"" Waldowski. These were ideal cast members, made up of what were then relative unknowns.

Part two involves the relationship between the hypocritical Major Burns and the uptight Major Houlihan, ending in the infamous broadcast sequence, Burns's breakdown, and Houlihan's unveiling. Part three is about Painless Pole's and the notorious ""Last Supper."" Part four is a Japan adventure.

Then, part five is the film's climactic football game between the 4077th MASH and a rival company. The game is an obvious metaphor for the war itself and its infantile but deadly battles. As Altman does in all the sequences in the film, he fills every frame with a multitude of action, so much so that a second and third viewing are necessary just to catch it all. Finally, the film ends with the goings home and the fond farewells, not all of them tearful.

Fox presents the picture in its original theatrical aspect ratio, 2.35:1. The Blu-ray reproduction is in reasonably decent high-definition, restored and color matched to the source material some years ago. Interestingly, Altman used several filters to achieve the desaturated colors he wanted throughout the majority of the film, so you'll find many of the hues purposely faded looking, right up until the football sequence, which suddenly comes alive with brilliant colors. Apparently, Altman wanted the movie's visual image to match the film's content and theme in tone and accomplished the task nicely.

Likewise, the audio, primarily rendered in English via 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, may also at first blush appear less than ideal. It's meant to be that way. Altman wanted to capture the sounds of real people in real conversations, so he encouraged the use of overlapping dialogue and miked each of the actors separately. The result can be a tad rough by the standards of today's soundtracks, but it is quite listenable.

The Blu-ray disc contains quite a lot of material. The first bonus is an audio commentary with director Robert Altman. Next, there's a documentary, ""Backstory: The Making of M*A*S*H,"" which contains the usual assortment of filmmaker interviews. Then, there's a still gallery; a healthy bunch of chapter selections; a widescreen English-language trailer and a Portuguese trailer; English, French, and Spanish spoken language options; and English, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Thai subtitles.

Next, there's ""The Complete Interactive Guide to M*A*S*H, followed by more documentary items. There is a feature called ""Enlisted: The Story of M*A*S*H."" And after that is a feature called ""Remembering M*A*S*H,"" a 30th anniversary reunion.

For a low-budget film, M*A*S*H did all right for itself, especially considering its relatively unknown director and unknown stars. It managed to win an Academy Award for its screenwriter, Ring Lardner, Jr., who had long before been blacklisted in Hollywood for his stand against McCarthyism. Ironically, the film almost got an X rating for a single hard profanity (how times change), and Lardner complained early on that Altman had changed or deleted most of his script. I suppose the Oscar helped assuage his feelings. Furthermore, the Academy nominated the movie for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Sally Kellerman), Best Director, and Best Film Editing (Danford B. Greene). This is a hard comedy to resist.",1437782400,9,5600,5.110382513661202

How this show spawned a successful series that was iconic for an entire generation is beyond me.  I get dry humor, I even get British humor, but besides a few one-liners that made me snicker, this movie was bland.  The cast list was a who's-who of Hollywood, but it appears that all of them had yet to refine their acting abilites.  The deliveries all seemed forced.

It's hard to flesh out so many characters in a near 2-hour movie.  For some reason when this film used to be on TV now and again I just couldn't get into it.  But I guess with age comes new understanding and interests.  Now I can appreciate it.  Not being a fan of football, the game towards the end was the only real downside for me.  I would rather they continued what they were doing instead of changing focus like that.  But all in all, it was a good movie and the actors really brought it to life.  My disc also had some extra features (that I haven't watched yet), including a commentary track and the AMC Backstory.

What struck me this time around was how different we treat women in the media today. A vast improvement. Antics that were funny in the early 1970s seemed rather appalling in today's culture. It's actually encouraging to see how far we have come in a quest from equality between the sexes and ethnic groups. This movie would never fly today or as a TV series, but it probably was liberal compared to the period in the early 1950s when the Korean War was being fought.

354706,5,6301777387,"The film that preceded the great MASH TV series is often forgotten but is well worth a look.  With Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould as complete incorrigible surgeons, Sally Kellerman as 'hot lips', and Robert Duvall as Frank, you had all the elements of a great film drama/comedy.  The only element that didn't fit was Duvall who was a bit overly serious for what was a 'dark' comedy and not a crime drama...
The plot had the two ace surgeons(Gould,Sutherland) flown out of Korea to the main hospital for that war theatre, where they  had to save a patient whose surgical work had been screwed up.  Because they saved the 'bacon' of the staff there, they were given leave and they made the most of it.
The film is pure crazy fun, with a madcap football game at the end between this MASH and another unit, playing for big bucks.  Some AFL football stars appeared as themselves as 'ringers', snuck into the game by a cheating unit commander.  However, our squad has their own tricks, including some oddly rolled 'cigarettes' that get the enemy team to stop playing hard.
With serious touches, like helping a Korean avoid the draft and providing med assistance to the local citizenry, as well as covering the insanity that is war, this film touched all the bases and did it very well.
The aspect of Blu-Ray was not important here where the action is dialogue and not visual.  So, either rendition(Blu-Ray, DVD) is absolutely fine and well-worth getting...",1417132800,,1454,4.723320158102767

The trouble is, said show completely blew the movie out of the water. While funny enough, the movie will be a great disappointment to anyone who has seen the show already. Donald Sutherland is no match for Alan Alda's vibrant portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce. It is sometimes difficult to read Mr. Sutherlands expression even without his hat, while you can see evil plans crossing Mr. Alda's face even behind a surgical mask and cap. Up until the football game in the last 15 minutes, the only break in the bored monotone voices shared by all of the actors and the slow lackadaisical pace (which even carries into the operating room) is Major Hoolihan's momentary histerics. The movie paved the way for the show and introduced us to Gary Burghoff as our beloved Corporal Radar O'Reilly, but even he did not truly come in to his own until the pilot episode of the show...2 full years later. We are grateful to the movie for it's introduction, but the show ran for 11 seasons on the merit of having an almost entirely different cast.",1415923200,,1175,4.653846153846154

354854,2,6301777387,"I just saw this movie for the first time.  I'm 37 and grew up watching MASH (not religiously but it seemed to always be on).  I like the TV show.  I do not like the movie.  It is just SEVERELY OUTDATED and NOT FUNNY.  I did not LOL one time.  It is awkward and illegal and ridiculous and yes sexist. I understand that it may be a ""timepiece"" of an earlier age, but I don't believe anything done in the show could have been gotten away with in the Army during Korea.  I am currently active duty nearing retirement and do have some insight in the military institution.

1. Hawkeye steals a Jeep.  He would be arrested.
2. Hawkeye seems to have a nervous tick of whistling oddly.  Funny?
3. The guy Hawkeye stole the Jeep from gets in a fistfight.  He would be arrested.
4. The Officers ogle and harass and bang every woman in camp.  But since they are doctors it isn't harrassment?
5. Everyone is screwing.  People must have screwed a lot more than we do now-a-days.
6. The whole look and feel is Animal House. I never liked Animal House.
7. Is this Korea or Vietnam?  Why are people smoking weed?
8. Their handling of a suicidal soldier is inappropriate.
9. What is the relevance of the Last Supper scene?  I'm thinking THERE IS NONE... They just did it.  Why don't I get my family to do it, and cast everyone in random positions as to have no meaning at all.  Weeee!
10. Golf near the front lines... How American.  Yawn.
11. The football game scene was entirely too long.  It basically showed an entire football game.  It seemed like the scene could have been cut and pasted from Animal House.  It even had the ""gag"" sound effects (kazoo/whistle, etc).  It was boring, I had to force myself to stay awake, and by this point I was just hoping the movie would end soon.
12. Do these guys operate on people after drinking Martinis all day?
13. There is no sense of time passing.  Did all this take place in a week?  3 years?  People bang each other and cheat on their husbands/wives after what seems like 2 days.
14. I could go on and on.

Was this movie relevant in 1970?  I guess I can understand that; with Vietnam raging and whatnot.  I just think the time for this movie, and it's relevance in any way, has long long past.  IT DOES NOT HOLD UP WELL.

The movie is only better than the TV show in that on TV there is ZERO blood.  The TV show has one of those crazy stupid laugh tracks like most comedies did back when TV had to tell you to laugh.",1415577600,3,2447,4.231601731601732

Instead I'm going to comment on my experience streaming it via Amazon Fire; which is why I got the email asking for a rating...lol.
IMHO Amazon Fire TV rocks! Previously I streamed Netflix and Amazon Instant Video via a Panasonic Blu-ray/dvd player that was pretty darn good. However it wasn't as user friendly as Fire TV nor as fast.
Watching MASH on AFTV gets a 5 star rating because it's such a smoooooooooth experience!

355425,5,6301777387,"I first saw this movie in about 1970 when I was on active duty in the Army, the height of the Vietnam war.  The point is that you needed to be there.  The movie crystallized the absurdity of rank versus competence, a lesson I never forgot. I went on to spend the next 30 years in the military, but I never forgot the lesson I learned from this movie: Look out for guys like ""Radar,"" look out for guys like ""Hawkeye,"" or even look out for those Major Burns or Hotlips of the world.

When I saw this movie for the first time it was a military theatre, with 99 percent of the viewers draftees.  It restored my position on freedom of the press and democracy.  Why would my government, pursuing an obviously unwise military adventure in Vietnam allow such a movie to be shown to the troops?  But then it dawned on me.  Democracies are chaotic, unscripted, and free; there will never be a unified message simply because people disagree in a democracy.

So I left that theatre clearly in agreement with the parody of the officer ranks, but that was tempered with the knowledge that real ""officers"" had made it possible for me to see the film.  So I think I understood.  Officers in the military (on average) understand that they are nothing special, rather they are carrying out a job assignment.

I was drafted shortly after seeing M*A*S*H and saw it again at the post theatre at Ft. Gordon then again in the Enlisted Men's club in Kontum, RVN and again when I was stationed at  radio relay site on top of a mountain near Amberg, Germany.

Although this movie was the first I bought on VHS, I hadn't watched the movie M*A*S*H in at least 10 years before I watched it the other night.  It was still as funny and irreverent as ever although some things I thought funny in my twenties made me a bit uncomfortable in my sixties.

Some folks may find the lack of military discipline portrayed in M*A*S*H to be unbelievable.  Not me.  Despite M*A*S*H being set during the Korean Conflict, I think much of the behavior of REMFs in Vietnam was patterned after M*A*S*H.  In my experience, even if M*A*S*H wasn't totally factual in some respects, it was certainly faithful to the surrealism of rear echelon life in Vietnam during that undeclared war.",1393459200,,1099,4.532994923857868

355685,5,6301777387,"Robert Altman's 1969 anarchic comedy still holds up very well.  Set during the Korean War and made during the Vietnam War, it's main comic focus is on the irrelevance of authority -- that, more than anything, caused it to resonate when it first came out, at a time when the public was beginning to realize that the political authorities prosecuting the Vietnam War were systematically deceiving the people with false body counts overseas and efforts to stifle dissent at home.  The movie depends on the good-heartedness and professional competence of the military doctors and nurses to let us see that authority has really nothing to do with whether or not the M*A*S*H unit is doing its job of saving lives and that in that basic human concern rank and hierarchy mean nothing.  Hawkeye's insistence on being addressed by his nickname even by ""subordinates"" is just one example of that.  Col. Blake's refusal to see that a M*A*S*H unit isn't simply ""the army""  drives him into hypocrisy and craziness -- he refuses to see that he is basically under the same pressures as his men, and when he is humiliated by being very publicly caught in a liaison with ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan he can't laugh it off and is carted away in straitjacket.  Houlihan, who starts as a stickler for order and discipline, is publicly humiliated twice -- and finally joins in the anarchic spirit, which means that she can go on doing what she's really good at: being a nurse.  So ironically, the anarchy is enabling and life-enhancing, not destructive.  Burns's replacement. Col. Blake, is presented as wise enough to turn a blind eye to all but the essentials, which here is simply keeping the field hospital going.

The anarchic spirits are played by Donald Sutherland (Hawkeye), Elliott Gould (Trapper John), and Tom Skerritt (Duke), all in their golden youths.  Sally Kellerman is ""Hot Lips"" and Robert Duvall has in effect a cameo as the unfortunate Col. Burns -- he would have his own destructive anarchic time a little later in ""Apocalypse Now"" (""I love the smell of napalm in the morning . . ."").  All are marvelous.  Altman is also not afraid to play for some sheer old-fashioned Three-Stooges-like physical schtick (the MPs when Hawkeye steals the jeep, and the football game with the 325th), but grounding it all are the wounded bodies that the men work on -- not grossly presented but bloody enough to keep it real.

None of that thematic stuff is articulated in the movie itself -- it's all rendered through action.  Were it to be made explicit, by having a character explain it all, the movie would become preachy and sanctimonious.  The TV series spun off from this movie was good but didn't always avoid sentimentality and sanctimony.  It's often said by pundits, especially on the right, that Americans have never recovered from the general lack of respect for authority that began to be questioned during the 1960s.  Arguably we haven't -- and arguably most of those who still set themselves up as moral authorities especially end up showing their hypocrisy or venality or pettiness.  So it's still useful to have movies like this around . . .",1392422400,,3131,4.831460674157303

355774,5,6301777387,"I think films like this are great products from their time. They involve you in a way that other pieces don't. Altman was a master at involving the viewer in multiple conversations and threads and it makes films like MASH insistent om amusing you in some way. For instance I could have probably watched another two hours of this cast flutter around, creating the world that they present to us viewers. I would give it 4.5 stars total but it still gets my highest recommendation. Not for everyone really but Altman is good stuff, even the lesser films of his are interesting, and this rises above those quite a bit.

The bitrate is solid. The master used could be better.... but as said by Altman the filmstock and techniques used present a fairly soft picture. Not much DNR has been used but be sure not to expect something very sharp or modern looking. Definitely did not have a huge restoration attached to this film.

Robert Altman had a hit with this. His style of direction allegedly prompted relatively experienced lead actors Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland to seek Altman's sacking before they realized that unorthodox though his approach was, the rushes produced some great moments. Like all intelligent and wonderfully made films, M*A*S*H stands the test of time and remains absolutely worth watching. Sally Kellerman as Hot Lips Houlihan is a delight (and we find out where the nick-name comes from). Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall, Rene Aubenjenois, Bud Cort and others provide excellent support. Altman's son discovered the title track (repeated on the highly successful TV series). This is a scathing, bitter-sweet black comedy which moves the viewer.",1380412800,,894,5.392857142857143

It is definitely timely for any generation caught up in times of war. The mindset of the viewer seeing this in 1970 and then again forty years later is interesting. We became more sophisticated viewers by the time of the late 1950s and now our sophistication possibly very much tinged with cynicism through the years may look at this film in new light that perhaps was there all the time. I think that Tom Skerritt's character Duke Forrest is most effective here. By the end of the film he still had ties to reality. Donald Sutherland's Hawkeye Pierce and Elliott Gould's Trapper John McIntyre seemed trapped and outcast by their own cynicism. They are definitely the casualties of this war.

Altman, together, comprised a powerful collaboration, the product of which endures to this day. All of the actors
were very well suited to their roles as sinner/saints, giving the best of care to the wounded while having good
fun along the way. Duvall is memorable as Frank Burns, the incompetent, hypocritical head surgeon. Kellerman
does a standup job as Hotlips, caring and nauseatingly military. Sutherland, Gould, and Skerritt are well-cast
as surgeons attempting to repair the traumae of war. Everybody just wants to get the job done and go back
home. Betting on whether Hotlips is a natural blonde, repairing the senator's son in Japan, and helping John Schuck
overcome his latent homosexuality are hysterically funny incidents! Lardner and Altman excelled in this production.

The film was set in Korea- and credit goes to the set designers for the look of muddy squalor- but the attitude is all post-Vietnam.  No authority is respected, and the military is portrayed as an institution totally without merit.  The doctors sport Fu Manchus and shaggy hairdos more appropriate for 1972 than 1952.  When ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan shows up and proves to be a stickler for regulations, she is quickly and viciously humiliated sexually.  Drs. Pierce and McIntyre seem more like drunken clods than fun-loving scalpel jockeys.

MASH effectively is a commentary against war and is seemingly as somber as it is funny. However, up to the end you are left with a smile on your face. The climatic moments during the football game will have all riled up and fittingly we see Captain Pierce (Sutherland) ride away in the same stolen jeep he had when arriving.

356025,5,6301777387,"In every way, from directing, sound, writing, cameras, acting, MASH is a hard one to
beat for a comedy. Robert Altman's movie begins with the army hospital in sync. The
choppers bring the wounded into the hospital as the Johnny Mandel instrumental plays.
Like a lot of war movies, the film gets right into action. There is more extensive
movie credits in the beginning of the movie than you normally see. ""Suicide Is Painless""
is instantly identified as the movie theme. Movie themes have a special place in my
heart, and sometimes directors don't use them. You get to see the same song performed
at the Hawkeye's version of ""The Last Supper"". I don't really know if Hawkeye
orchestrated all that. The hi-jinx all were probably a combined effort of Trapper,
Hawkeye, and Dr. Forrest. Anyhow, the whole memorial service thing had a reason. To
help a guy out with his ""Manowar"" stallion complex. What? Jawbreaker fail? In my opinion,
the Dental Don Juan didn't need any help.

MASH is R. I have to wonder, who were they protecting? Good movie to see if you
sneaked some liquor into the theater, got drunk with friends, or the girlfriend,
the wife, but no kids under 21. At least in your opinion. You don't want your
descendants or your neighbor's kids there. That's the real reason you wanted to go
with a bunch of adults to see the movie about the 4077th. After 1956 videocassettes
went on sale. So you could go into the room where the set is and watch MASH again
with Junior. You could explain hypocrisy, or try, like why Major Burns is not a
""godless be-fool"" but everyone else in the camp is. You could try to get pointers
yourself on how to pick up women the way Duke Forrest does. The surgeon lacks real
Southern charm with the female staff. But he knows how to do meatball surgery with
the best.

In all, there are roughly six different stories or chronicles in the Mash film, and
you should watch the movie several times before you select your favorites. Despite
the fact the movie was about an army hospital during the Korean War, only one of
the little stories had an unhappy ending. Hawkeye could not pull the wool over
a Korean physician's eyes.

356128,1,6301777387,"Well, I decided to watch M*A*S*H again, after some three decades.

My, how times change!

I saw this movie several times as a teen back in the 70's, and just loved it. It has been called the first great movie of the 1970's, a seminal flic in that decade of great American cinema (perhaps the greatest.) And it shows Robert Altman at his finest, with natural dialogue and multi-layered scenes. Throw in the all-star ensemble cast and you you should have a winner.

What I really liked was the hyper realism of the operating room and the medical scenes. I'm sure people thought it was pretty gory for its time, but the realism is far less ostentatiously bloody than a recent movie, like say Academy Award best picture ""The Departed.""

Mind you, my opinion has now changed.

First, the movie is undeniably sexist. Women are objects in the movie, and we are talking the absolutely vital nurses that, as we now know, are the real backbone of any hospital. And there is a whiff of homophobia.

Additionally, I read a NYT review that suggested that this was the first mainstream movie to openly mock organized religion. Now I like a good laugh at the expense of a holy roller just as much as the next guy, for sure. But, while there are few very humourous moments, mostly these scenes come off as cruel and disrespectful.

I know that this movie was really a critique of the Vietnam War dressed up as Korea (while that war was going on!) but there are just too many sour bits for me to enjoy the movie anymore.

Perhaps the most annoying thing is that the movie vacillates been hyper-realistic seriousness (which it does with panache and really well,) and plain silly comedy. You know, if I was the editor, I would have taken out a few of the sillier scenes, and a lot of the sexism, and I think you'd have the ""classic"" that many people feel M*A*S*H is.

356330,5,6301777387,"MASH, also known as M*A*S*H, is perhaps better known as a long running TV series, but there was an award winning movie which came first. Featuring many of the same characters, MASH is about a crew of doctors and nurses at an army hospital near the front lines. While supposedly set in Korea, this was made in 1970 and is fairly clearly pointed at the Vietnam war. It shows just how pointless war can be, how people live and die almost by chance, and how the characters struggle to keep their sanity amongst it all.

It's not a ""story"" as much as almost a reality show, and apparently portions of the dialogue were ad-libbed as the actors got into their characters. You see how relationships and loyalties get tested, how playing golf on a helicopter landing pad seems to make perfect sense, and how the doctors try their best to save their young friend from going into the army. If you watched the TV series it can be hard, sometimes, to separate how the characters were in the TV series with how they are here - there are numerous differences.

There are all sorts of subtle items in here. For example, in one scene the actors pose in an exact replica of The Last Supper.

Well worth watching to get a sense of what people thought about the Vietnam War in the 70s, and just to immerse yourself in absurdity for a while. MASH helps to illustrate that even amongst death and carnage, people tend to go on with life as best they can, finding love, joy, and moments of peace.

In terms of the Bechdel test, MASH passes - barely. An opening scene has a table of nurses all talking with each other, and two of them end up being minor characters with names. They are talking about nursing activity. However, that is really it. Through the rest of the movie there are really only three female characters. One is a blonde who sleeps with the commanding officer, one is a feistier nurse that ends up ""saving"" the Dentist by sleeping with him, and then one is the infamous Hot Lips who falls for Major Burns. So we do have three females - but they really don't talk with each other at all after that opening scene. They are just there to be slept with by the guys.",1327449600,,2154,4.390977443609023
356331,2,6301777387,"The film is easily five stars, but this Blu-Ray transfer only gets two. Despite so many reviewers complaining about film grain and shoddy picture quality/clarity, the main problem is that the image has been tampered with in regard to size. The picture quality is perfectly fine, considering that this film was not shot in hi-def and not even with a very big budget (this is as clear as M*A*S*H will get...and the image clarity is better than ever).

The only problem I have, is that the film's title did NOT fit on the screen (the left leg of the letter ""M"" and half of the right leg of the letter ""H"" are off screen when the title is shown during the film's opening). I immediately threw on my old standard DVD for a comparison, and that one fit perfectly. In fact, on the standard DVD, there is a comfortable margin of space on screen to the left and right of the title. This sizing error continues throughout the entire Blu-Ray version of the film. At one point, Altman holds a shot which is intended to be a take on ""The Last Supper"", and the character sitting on the far right end of the table is only half in the frame (this compromises the artistic intent of the director). I checked my television settings, and they were all in proper order.

This is one of my favorite films, and I hope this problem is remedied. I hope Criterion will eventually put out a release, as this is also a very important film.",1326067200,7,1412,4.406130268199234

356333,5,6301777387,"The great Robert Altman film, and what an excitement to watch it again. Donald Sutherland is weird with his strange face and his lanky demeanor, Sally Kellerman is absurd as a regular army clown, Tom Skeritt is hard to take without his signature mustache (he seems out of place as a 4077th Swamp wise-ass) and Robert Duvall is a freaky Frank Burns. Best of all is Elliot Gould, the man who brings a jar of olives to Korea for his martinis. I love the classic scene where he drops an olive into a martini glass that is sitting on the ground of his tent. Nice scene when Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan is getting out of the helicopter, you get a view of her garters, then see her stand up straight to salute the commanding officer, before ducking down in order to not get decapitated by the chopper blades (Sally Kellerman did that stunt herself, by the way). Funny thing about Painless Paul's prick. The scenes in surgery are pure black comedy, with the cast murmuring and adlibbing while there's blood all over the linens. Great dialogue too:

  Hawkeye (to Hot Lips, after she's berated him for letting the nurses call him Hawkeye, etc.) Oh come off it, Major. You put me right off my fresh fried lobster, do you realize that? I'm now going to go back to my bed, I'm going to put away the best part of a bottle of scotch... And under normal circumstances, you being normally what I would call a very attractive woman, I would have invited you back to share my little bed with me and you might possibly have come. But you really put me off. I mean you... You're what we call a regular army clown.
  Hot Lips: I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a level of responsibility in the medical corps.
  Father Mulcahey: He was drafted.

Then there's the great scene where Frank and Hot Lips get together

  - God meant us to find each other.
  - His will be done.

Mad necking and groping ensues. Hawkeye corners Frank on the matter, asks ""Was she better than self abuse?"" When Frank attacks Hawkeye, Trapper yells out ""Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye, the man's a sex maniac. I don't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Don't let him kiss you."" Classic. The madness of Frank Burns, the pain of Painless Paul agonising of the ""latent homosexuality"" that he must expose his three fiancees back home to, the recreation of Michelangelo's Last Supper scene before curing Paul with a faked suicide, it's all aces.

The movie goes so quickly through so many classic scenes that you think it's done its job only an hour in. But wait, there's more. The mystery of Hot Lips' hair - is she a real blonde (we can find out in so many ways). Then there's the great harangue ""This is not a hospital, this is an insane asylum."" The Japan scenes are hot, full of insubordinance, mock-bad dialogue, and fantastic irreverence (not to mention the umbrella fencing scene. Nobody spoke authentic Japanese (or Korean, for that matter). The story fills out with a football game, which includes some of the crappiest scenes of the movie, the only ones that are relatively plot-driven. Oh well. It's funny anyway - tokin' on the bench, general chaos, civil war on the field, it's a mini war that doesn't need Korea to produce injuries and lost lives. Funny scenes, like Father Mulcahey praying for the safety of each jeep, or ""Tokyo Shoeshine Boy"" coming over the loudspeakers.

Then there's also a 20-minute documentary on the first disc, then three documentaries (40 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes) on the second disc. Let's see if I can get to all of them.

On the first disc there's an interesting documentary giving the background of the production. It seems like the director took out all references to Korea, even adding rice farmers hats from Vietnam into the crowd in some scenes. The film had a small budget, only $3.5 million, director Robert Altman only took $75,000. Twentieth Century Fox at the time had two other war films, each one more patriotic: ""Patton"" and ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" Altman kepta low profile while filming, and used new actors, or relatively unknown actors. Donald Sutherland had taken a small role in The Dirty Dozen, and Elliott Gould had been in a few pictures. Tom Skerrit had been with Altman in a few projects, the only actor who had previously worked with Altman. There is a great scene with Altman telling Sutherland at a party that the guy he plays calls himself Hawkeye. ""Hawkeye?"" the young Canadian asks. The role was good for Sutherland, who was struggling financially at the time, although he and Gould eventually went on to fight Altman with their agents and the studio. Altman used new actors and unknowns to keep his budget low, and he turned in the footage two days early and under-budget by $500,000. The documentary also has a screen test of Kim Atwood and Elliott Gould in 1969. ""A crazy camp, a mad set."" Mumbling in the background ""pushes journalism to its outer limits."" The zoom keeps actors on their toes, because you never know when you could ruin a shot, even if you're behind the scenes somewhat. The rift between Altman and Sutherland/Gould unwittingly led them to give great performances. Altman and Burghoff went naked for Sally. The studio was shocked at what they got, and the non-linear film needed a thread in the editing. They finally realised that they could use the speaker announcements to provide that, the wording of which comes from Korean war almanacs and military manuals. Ironically, the old-school screenwriter objected most to the film's release, due to the massive liberties taken with his script, but ended up being the only one to get an Oscar for the film.

There were two long documentaries I didn't have time for, but I did watch the 30th Anniversary Cast reunion, which was good, although it didn't have Donald Sutherland. It's not very good, as it shows how nonchalantly they gave an award to Robert Altman (who looks exactly like he did when he was making M*A*S*H*), but it has some interesting lines. Seems like Altman hated the series, thought that it was racist. ""Everybody's a racist. We're all racists."" Apparently Michael Altman only wanted a guitar as payment for his involvement in the movie, but he got a contract after all and probably ended up making more money than his dad did.",1314316800,2,6268,4.682727272727273

A couple of his films that have withheld the test of time, Nashville and California Split, come readily to mind. Those slice of life films still ""speak"" to the subjects at hand, the glitter of country music stardom and its underside reality and the fight to get rich quick at the gambling tables. No so this film, M.A.S.H., a film that on first viewing I was very impressed with. On a recent re-viewing I found myself distracted most of the time. Not that the film's ""follies of war"" theme in a front-line Army medical unit (then the Vietnam War, although the earlier Korean War is the thinly-veiled locale of the film, and not to be confused with the handful of American wars since then) has lost its significance. If anything that theme is more relevant that ever. What has lost power, and punch, is the notion that through the antics, and frankly this thing is filled with antics, that would embarrass even the lowliest ""frat rat"", can draw those lessons about the folly of war. Sex, sacrifice, more sex, some off-hand skilled surgery, more hi-jinks and booze, and then off to home (and presumably a soft, country club life) do not make that same impression that first drew me to the film. Even Elliot Gould, who was great, and still is worth seeing, in California Split and as an understated Phillip Marlowe in the film version of Raymond Candler's The Long Good-bye got on my nerves.

This is the Korean War (1950-1953). We are visiting and passionate on the front line and observing the many lives of the very people that make the M*A*S*H (The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit possible. This film is touted as a thinly veiled Vietnam War satire.

Some great one-liners as ""You forgot your shingle doctor ""as he holds up a piece of toast with creamed chipped beef on it. Or as Frank Burns is being hauled off in a straight jacket, the loud speaker is playing ""it's time to say sayonara"" May military inside jokes and even the clich&eacute;s have a basis in reality.  Although this film takes place, in Korea, it draws a very close parallel to the environment I was in Vietnam and I suspect there have been other wars with other environments similar and may again in the future. It's the laughs that we clean out of these types of films that make those situations tolerable.

For many movies especially older ones Blu-Ray is really just a gimmick and does not really add to or subtract from the storyline or the acting itself. However occasionally the visuals and sounds of Blu-Ray can contribute to earlier movies that were designed before Blu-Ray was conceived; this is one of those movies.  This review may be under a different version but it is for the Blu-ray version so be sure to listen to the commentary by the late Robert Altman, AMC Back history, Enlisted: The story of M*A*S*H, M*A*S*H: History Through the Lens, Remembering M*A*S*H: 30th anniversary, Theatrical Trailer, Portuguese Trailer, and Still Gallery.

Through early morning fog I see
The visions of the things to be.
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize, and I can see.....

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

The game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card, I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it brim..

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
""Is it to be, or not to be?""
And I replied, ""why ask me?""

But suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

And you can do the same thing if you please

356459,4,6301777387,"I've been a fan of MASH (the movie, not the TV show) since I first saw it at about age 14 or 15 on DVD.  Recently, I've been getting into the rest of Altman's movies, so when I saw the blu ray I knew I had to check it out.  If you haven't seen it yet, MASH is a bit of a (pardon me) mash up of a war movie, medical drama, and Animal House.  Okay, it's really just a lot like Animal House.  Some reviews I've seen online have pegged this movie as being sexist and outdated, but the film is really about the attitudes of a bunch of really talented and really bored twenty something male doctors BS-ing and causing trouble.  Unlike the most of Altman's other work, this is very much a guy movie.  I used to think this movie was just effortlessly brilliant and an easy going good time with a bunch of funny actors just doing whatever they felt like.  On subsequent viewing after all these years, I can see just how much Altman's distinctive style had already taken shape in his first film.  The scene towards the ends of the movie in long shot with Hawkeye getting news from Radar is absolutely astonishing in how much it conveys with no words at all.  Even though I still remembered all the jokes and cringed at the awkwardness of some of the characters, I still found myself laughing out loud at some of the more subtle moments.

Of course, these little bits might have gone unnoticed had I not sprung for the HD version.  Again, other reviews on the films picture quality range from decent to miserable and the real result is somewhere in between.  Immediately after watching the disc, I popped in the old THX mastered DVD, upconverted by my blu ray player.  I'll admit I was a bit surprised.  The major problem with the blu ray is an excessive amount of blooming on any scenes with white clothing.  They give off a glow a few centimeters out from the characters.  I first thought this was haloing, but no, they were just really bright in comparison with the dark backgrounds.  On the DVD, this effect was a lot less noticeable, but everything else picture-wise was worse.  For one, the image was a lot darker, smudging out a lot of fine detail.  The rest was lost in the digital noise and non-film related pixelated graininess.  However, in stripping away the murk on the blu ray, it revealed Altman's almost vaseline-like filter on the camera and color timing intended to accentuate the drab military greens.

The first thing I looked for on the blu ray was just how much grain they did or didn't leave on the image.  Thankfully, they left most of it in, but it does get a little overwhelming at times, with it seeming to snow over background scenery.  There's a lot more surface detail on fabrics and the stubble on the actors' faces stands out a bit more.  There's a scene near the beginning of the movie with nurses looking into a tent giggling that was less apparent on DVD, since it was so quick and more difficult to read facial expressions.  I'm once again going to repeat the mantra of almost every reviewer covering HD movies from the 70's - this is probably the best this movie is going to look.  The main reason I bought this was just to see what 70s Altman movie can look like in high definition.  I assure you that now I'm going to hold out for the HD version of Nashville, instead of buying the DVD.

As far as sound goes... well, I honestly couldn't tell you if it was an improvement or not.  I don't have a surround sound system to really put the track to test, but I don't think there can be that much of an improvement over the 5.1 mix on the original DVD.  I do think I could follow the rapid overlapping better than I used to, but that probably just comes from repeated viewing, rather than a real technical achievement.  All of the extras were ported over from the previous disc, which is good, since it was a fairly packed two disc set.  However, there's no real new stuff to be had.  Overall, I'm really just jonesing to see how McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Brewster McCloud, and Nashville hold up on the format.  It may not look perfect, or even that good, but this disc shows just what a little TLC can do towards making great murky-looking 70s films watchable on HD sets.",1255392000,6,4193,4.38163001293661

I also love BD and what it has done for our industry, so I went into this release with great expectations, and really, I was not disappointed (though it could always be better). If you already have the special edition that Altman cleaned up, this appears to be an identical transfer with no significant changes.

The picture looks great compared to the original releases as most of the artifact has been removed and the color has been saturated extensively - but in a good way. There is an apparent softness throughout, but compared to what the original product was, I don't mind. The DTS was not the greatest, and the front three channels get all the work. I even tried the football game and some jeep scenes but nothing gets around to the rear channels much. The supplements are identical to the special edition release (roughly 5 hours of docus and extras on all the other DVD sets) with a couple exceptions here:
* Still Gallery - 70 pics that had to be taken from the BD transfer as they are very crisp. Screen saver worthy.
* Complete Interactive Guide: A fun tally on all things done by the characters. When activated, a headshot pic pops up while that person is on screen and a cumulative number appears referencing how many drinks or fights partaken, and/or court martials that should be happening. When there are large volumes of people on the screen the shots take up the whole top and bottom half of the set, but it helps keep track of who enters and leaves each scene. Worth doing once you have watched the film and have time to kill. Customers walking by the screening actually liked this option as it is a nice review of the supporting actors.

There are subs in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Dubbed in Spanish and French with an English 2.0 option. A Portguese trailer was thrown in for good measure. Overall, the picture turned out nice and the sound better than before, and this would be a nice upgrade if you did not already get the other set. I noticed much more grain on a larger display but the smaller LCD panels showcased a solid preservation. Hope you enjoy.",1251417600,24,2267,4.5268292682926825

Sadly both my friend and I sat in stunned silence through the film, which was (1) not funny unless you find a man stepping on a rake and hitting himself in the face hilarious, (2) disgustingly misogynistic (from the way Hotlips was treated  - first as a prude who needed to be brought down a few notches, and then as a nincompoop, to the other female characters (nurses in both the MASH unit and in Tokyo, and the prostitutes in Tokyo)), and to top it all off (3) racist and (4) anti-homosexual.

356467,5,6301777387,"There are really three groups of MASH lovers.  There are those who read the book and love it.  Those who loved the TV series.  Those who loved the movie.  Each group has its reasons why one is better than the other. I read Hooker's two MASH books and  found them funny and in the second one,touching. I enjoyed parts of the TV series, but the movie changed me.  MASH is one of those few movies that people know exactly where they were when they saw this movie and these types of  movies are very rare. I saw MASH in 1970 as a sneak preview to a B motorcycle movie[see my other reviews].  The house was packed because of the first movie and there were very few women there.  The movie started and the  music began and I had no idea what the h__l was going on. As the movie went on I found myself lost in every scene. I laugh because I wanted too, the laughter wasn't forced.  I can remember each scene clearly even today. But as I was watching the movie, I was thinking this isn't Korea, but a jab at Viet Nam.  I slowly realized that I was being shown an anti war movie.  A very good anti war movie that wasn't beating me over the head, but softly creaping into my mind.  In the late 60s and early 70s there were many anti war movies and they were not subtle at all.  People found them to be a big turn off, but not this movie.
 Looking back at it now, this movie pole vaulted Sutherland and Gould to superstar status.  We began to see movies with * in the titles, i.e S*P*Y*S, which was horrible.  WIFFS starting Gould was another anti war comedy, I am joking here it was terrible. But these two did do many very good movies, DON""T LOOK NOW [best sex scene ever} and the LONG GOODBYE.
  MASH opened my eyes to power of movie making, from the great script by Larnder, acting, filming, and theme song.  I never watched this movie again because of the strong impression it left on me.  It colored my view of the TV series and lead me to the books by Richard Hooker.  Don't mention those MASH GOES TO whatever series.
  This generation now remembers only the TV series and then only a lttle.  The kids today may see the TV series on some channel in the afternoon, but go on to something else.  This is to bad because this movie still holds up.  I have listen to students, who saw MASH at their college or in a film study class, rave about how funny it is and how much better it is than the TV series.  They ask me if I have seen it?  I smile and and shake my head.  I have asked them,"" Is that all it is ?  A comedy?""  The answer is always yes.  Today with the wars that are going on, MASH is just a comedy?  Times are a'changing.",1239321600,,2627,4.104330708661418
356548,1,6301777387,"I was hugely dissapointed in this film, which I purchased soley on my love of the television series.  What a mistake.  While it makes a nice edition to my collection, up there on the shelf with my M*A*S*H Season 1 thru 11 boxes, it is likely that I'll never watch it again.  To be honest, I can't even really say that I watched it once; I stopped the film about 15 minutes after the whole ""Frank and Hot Lips over the P.A."" bit.  It was just becoming to painful to watch. This film has found a home on my list of ""Most Over-rated"", right along with The Godfather and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

I do not mean this review to disparage fans of the movie in any way.  My main point here is that I grew up watching the TV show and, after that, the movie just didn't cut it.  My biggest complaint is that the jokes and pranks played by Hawkeye and Co. aren't fun and ultimately harmless as they are in the series; the characters as they are portrayed here are sexist, childish, and mean-spirited.  The silver lining? Except for the presence of Gary Burgoff as Radar, the movie is so completely disconnected from the series that it in no way affects my love for the TV show.",1237680000,6,1172,4.271493212669683
356549,1,6301777387,"I recently rented this DVD to share with my 18 year old son. While I can see how this film made such an impact, I did not find it to be a comedy, though I remembered it as being very funny when it first came out. My son did not see the humour in this movie either. I thought the treatment of women was horrific and I hope things have changed for women in the army since then.
My husband who was a nurse in Viet Nam said the doctors in his unit must have taken this movie to heart since they tried to act as the doctors in MASH. The nurses were not amused then and my family is not amused by this movie now.",1237248000,5,606,3.8174603174603177
356550,5,6301777387,"At the same time, Robert Altman's ""M*A""S*H"" came out. It, too found an audience, and truth be told many who enjoyed ""Patton"" enjoyed ""M*A*S*H"". It was just plain funny, and the anti-military theme was subtle. Altman walked a brilliant tightrope between a pro-American and unpatriotic premise. There is no doubt that Altman intended it as an anti-Vietnam movie. It was written by former Communist Ring Lardner, Jr. Lardner had been Blacklisted, and this fact featured prominently in the politics of the film's aura. It was based on a sexy paperback novel about surgeons in Korea. The film was set in Korea, yet made every possible attempt to convey the image that it was actually Vietnam. Many of the movie's set pieces were deliberately Vietnamese in nature and costume, for that very purpose. To the extent that it was unpatriotic, it subtly described ""regular Army"" officers as unyielding, intolerant Christians, utterly blinded by stupid jingoism. The draftees, however, are funny and attractive as they drink and love their way through a bevy of good-looking nurses, all while saving lives in the style of comic Galahads. Altman showed genius as a filmmaker. The movie avoided real controversy because it was just so darn good.
""M*A*S*H"" spurred a television show that ran for years. In the 1970s it played for its time and audience. Re-runs, however, strain its credibility beyond Altman's original themes. Two doctors played the ""bad guy."" The first was a complete buffoon. Frank Burns was prominently identified as a Republican. He is given zero good qualities. He is ugly, a bad doctor, a coward, a racist and all-around mean SOB who cheats on his wife with Major Margaret Hoolihan, who at least is given some character. She is half-Vixen, half-Fascist, naturally Republican, a patriotic American in the ""worst way,"" who worships the idols of war. Over the years the writers gave Margaret a little development. Very little. Burns was replaced by Major Charles Emerson Winchester, a Boston Brahmin, naturally a Republican whose father ""knows Truman. He doesn't like him, but he knows him."" Winchester, like Hoolihan, is allowed a touch of humanity when the liberal writers felt charitable, but generally was available for all possible bashing. Two hero-doctors anchor the show by showing their intelligence, medical skills and tolerance as direct contrasts to the war effort. The CIA is lampooned, and a military effort that in reality featured MacArthur's Inchon campaign, perhaps the most brilliant invasion in history, is also played as foolish. In the end, the TV show and the film avoid being really and actually unpatriotic because they do feature an emphasis on the basic goodness of the American spirit under stress, but you will not catch me tuned in to those old re-runs(...)",1233878400,,2792,5.125
356551,3,6301777387,"The Bottom Line:

An uneven sketch comedy, M*A*S*H* is often reputed to reveal the absurdity of war when in fact the film is mainly content to offer Animal House style humor with war as a backdrop; overrated and dated, it should not rank high on a ""must-see"" or ""must-own"" list.",1230768000,,278,4.56
356552,5,6301777387,"Unbelievable, but true my husband had never seen the original movie M*A*S*H. It was great to see it again - the quality and wit still there.",1230249600,,140,4.423076923076923
356553,3,6301777387,"For its time, this was an entertaining comedy with an anti-war message that was loved for its ability to express the feelings of most Americans at the time on the Vietnam War.  This is a film about the Korean War only in name but as you will see throughout, the de facto Vietnam theme is prevalent throughout sometimes subtly but even blatantly for instance in the downtown ""Korea"" scene where the women are all wearing Vietnamese-style conical hats which is not indigenous to Korea.

Overall, this comedy doesn't age well for modern viewers although its anti-war message is very clear and resonates even today.  Some parts are simply boring and I especially found the whole football scene totally sleep-worthy and I didn't see how it added to the overall theme unless it's a way to show how Americans try to impose their culture on Asians with a sport that even today is struggling to find acceptance outside the U.S. and certainly within Asia.

One scene that I found very powerful and which made this film at least watchable for me was the suicide scene.  The U.S. is this big superpower that everyone respects (Painless) and yet the truth is that it is insecure and needs to express its ""manhood"" to regain its potency and the way they decided to do this is to commit ""suicide"" by going to war and it takes his friends (allies) to show him the way and to stop him from going through with his plans.  In a way this movie's premise represent the allies and the Vietnam War/U.S. government is ""Painless"".  The Hotlips/Frank Burns humiliation scene is also powerful in that it exposes the hypocrisy of the U.S. government in trying to tell other nations how to live and govern themselves when it itself is inherently corrupt and filled with major problems of its own as is shown in another scene with Duke exhibiting his racist tendencies for example.

Otherwise, the film is rather disjointed and comes across as a collection of anti-war skits that doesn't flow very well.  This dvd package is also disappointing as it unnecesarily puts into 2 discs what can be put onto one as the special features are not that long and the only reason I can think of why they would do this is to have the excuse to charge you more for the 2 discs.  The picture quality is slightly above VHS quality and there are still frames with white spots and other imperfections despite the heroic attempts at restoration of which they go through great pains to tell you on the second disc and in the accompanying booklet.

The sound quality is okay coming in Dolby Digital THX mastered stereo although they really should have provided 5.1 surround options as well.  However, the documentary ""Enlisted: The Story of MASH"" is a gem as it relates the true life of a MASH unit in Korea and this accounts for one full star of my rating.  This movie is also important though as it started the highly successful and in my mind much better long-running television series where you get much better script writing and hence jokes than you get here.

Still, this is an entertaining film that in a number of collected skits successfully shows us the futility and insanity of war.

Updated on 6 June 2011:

As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I'll have to append this here.  This blu-ray version of the film is certainly worth the double-dip as both the picture and sound qualities have improved vastly over the dvd version that I reviewed above.  While not pristine perfect the picture quality in 1080p looks a lot better than before and the sound in DTS HD MA 5.1 Surround is light years better than the dvd.  While the special feature documentaries haven't improved over the dvd on the strength of both the picture and sound quality improvements this blu-ray version of the film is worth the upgrade.

356555,2,6301777387,"""M.A.S.H."", both successful on the big screen and its many years performing in our smaller living rooms, is an ensemble film that uses surgery, comedy, drama, fear, and football to finally tell its off-the-map story.  There is no denying that Altman's film was funny - it was a comedy - but where it failed here yet succeeded in the smaller screen was the cohesiveness of the story and the development of our central characters.  In small thirty-minute segments, we learn more about our ""M.A.S.H."" in habitants than throughout the nearly two hours in the film.  From Donald Sutherland, to Eliot Gould, to even Robert Duvall, Altman's film never quite left the ground.  The story (or at least the little vignettes of it) were simple, the characters could have been multi-dimensional (yet simple), and the environment could have added to that overwhelming need for comedy, but instead Altman did nothing to connect these simple ideas.  Perhaps it was pioneering to see surgeons during the Korean War at work, but it added nothing to the overall film - no comedy, no insight, no charm - just a way to prove to the viewers that these men were actually men of medicine.  This was a cheap ploy that Altman did not use wisely.  ""M.A.S.H."" had all the inner-workings of a great comedy, the scene was set, and the overhead announce had his funny lines, but, sadly, this film never quite found its stride.  From the actors to the continuity to the muddled themes, ""M.A.S.H."" was genuine for its time, but watching it now, in 2008, it feels dated and overwhelmingly tiresome.

What a treat it was to see the groundlings of such great actors like Donald Sutherland, Eliot Gould, Robert Duvall, and even Tom Skerritt.  To see these infamous character actors in their youthful prime is worth one star already, but that may be it.  We cannot fault Altman for not giving these characters souls, because they did.  Hawkeye had his whistle and martini, Gould had his brutal honesty, and well, Frank had his religion and his ""Hot Lips"", but alas, our guys never took them further.  These characters were strong in their individual moments, such as when Hawkeye is borrowing the Jeep at the beginning of the film, but, like the others, he suddenly falls flat and uncharismatic throughout the rest of the film.  Duvall's Frank was another character that could have been a staple through the rest of the film, but again, just jumped without reason and walked off the screen.  While we were not hoping for other war films just to be reinvented, we were hoping for some form of structure with our characters that would allow us to see their growth, see their souls, and give us a reason to follow them into the operating room or, oddly, onto the football field.  They had jokes that would make us laugh, words that would inspire, and goofiness that would only befit Altman, but there was something desperately lacking with our guy near the front line.  Sutherland was fun, but as I watched, he was Donald Sutherland in a G.I. outfit.  It was Duvall pre-""The Apostle"".  It was Tom Skerritt being, well, Tom Skerritt.  This was the ultimate shortfall for this cast.  They could not shake their own personalities - their own selves for these roles.  Concluding with this feeble football game that came from nowhere (supposedly fitting in with the tangents of war), that gave us no emotional throwback for these characters - we were left with shells of what could have been.  This was a good movie, maybe lower than good, but greatness was in an earshot if only these fine actors would have tried.

Aside from the actors, the story itself seemed a failure from the beginning.  Not knowing the original ""theme song"" to this film, the ""suicide"" song set the wrong tone for the beginning of this film.  Sure, the morbid nature seemed to fit with what was happening in the operating room, but during the off chance that we knew what was happening in there, it just didn't seem to fit.  Then, when the dentist has his moment of sanity, we are returned to that same song.  It felt like one big clich that Altman didn't want to acknowledge.  While the television music could not be shaken from my mind, this little ditty needed to be erased completely.  Aside from the song, mentioned before, there was just no story to this Korean caper.  ""M.A.S.H."" would have been a stronger outing as smaller stories within one connecting story instead of trying to just keep it all continuous.  At one moment we are listening to Hot Lips and Frank, in another we are fighting for a Korean boy to not join his national army, and then to wrap it up, we are playing in a clich football match-up with an outcome everyone expected.  It felt like Altman had the ideas; he just didn't know how to connect them all cohesively.  The thought probably being that he could connect them through the surgery room banter was not worth the printed reel, while the guy doing the announcements at camp was not a close enough second place.  I wanted to like the quirkiness of the characters; I wanted to see the juxtaposition of the tragedy of the war, with the comedy of the doctors.  I wanted to see Sutherland use humor to alleviate the blood of war - alas - this never happened.  I chuckled once during the big Hot Lips shower scene, and that was it.  There was a level of brevity with Altman's war-torn camp, but at times it felt more along the lines of apathy.  Nobody cared, nobody had heart, nobody showed emotion except for Frank, and he was less than a secondary character.  What was needed to make ""M.A.S.H."" a stand out film was a big emotional element or characters with flaws, not the cheapened suicide song coupled with sexual escapades.  It just didn't work.

Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with the praise that Altman has received for this film.  ""M.A.S.H."" may have been a pioneering film for the time, but over the years it has become more and more chaotic, and less meaningful.  Altman's control over his characters and story is non-existent, as he just added short story over non-connective short story in hopes to make at least a two-hour long feature film.  Add in Sutherland's semi-annoying whistle, and we have monumental film that seemed avante-guard for the time, but now just feel misleading.  Remember, this was pre-""M.A.S.H."" the television show, which was a defined comedy/drama show.  Looking back at the film, it did work in simple 30 minute segments, so perhaps Altman was thinking television while he made this - that would make stronger sense for the continuity issue.  Either way, ""M.A.S.H."", with the cast and director had bigger hopes in my eyes, but was let down in the long run.  Time has nearly corrupted this film, and even with our current war standings - it just doesn't relate.

""It's the weirdest thing.  We're willing to accept anything, absolutely anything, in real life.  But we demand order from our fantasies"".
That is so true because at first watching the movie and having been in the military i was like there is no way they could punch a higher ranking officer, sexually harass anyone let alone a superior, have mustaches and haircuts like that and wear the clothes they wear and i wasn't one of the uptight guys in the military by any means.
Then about halfway through i thought to myself I'm finding it hard to accept a haircut and a mustache that's in a movie, yet i could watch the bloodiest war film and not question it or for that matter watch war any night of the week for real on the news.  When you think about it what should be harder to accept?
Maybe we shouldn't accept just anything in real life and have it be our fantasies that run wild.
Speaking of fantasy, i was done writing this review hours ago and i got this idea.  M.A.S.H could've been in the minds of me, my friends, or other guys in the military during all the hurry up and waiting.  The movie could be two guys that are in this unit who talk and have conversations about ""oh i'd like to do this or i'd like to punch that guy"" and we could be seeing their imaginations and their conversations played out for us.

One of my favorite scenes is when they raise the walls of the showers while Major Hot Lips Hoolihan was inside and she falls and her outburst afterwords is just priceless, also the scene before that where she makes out to Major Burns and it gets broadcast all over the camp, also a priceless scene.

True, the film is based on the book of the same name, but about the Korean War and MASH the movie, is as much about Vietnam as it was about Korea as far as the war is concerned. I love the grittiness of the film, the overlapping dialogue and such, all ground breaking stuff back in 1969-1970.

This review is for the 2-Disc DVD set.

  The Korean war lasted from 1950-53. The Vietnam War lasted from 1964-73.
This motion picture came around with the most perfect timing. Both wars were difficult for young American men who had to fight there leaving their innocence behind and suffer mental problems for many years after the war.
  This motion picture M*A*S*H was not meant to stir up bad, forgotten memories, but to offer comic relief.  It is meant for you to have a good laugh watching this film about the American Army of the Mobile Auxiliary Surgical Hospital 4077 in Korea (It was actually filmed in Calabasas, California).
  Cast includes: Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert DuVall, Rene Auberjonois, Sally kellerman, John Shuck, Jo Ann Pflug, Fred Williamson, Michael Murphy, Gary Burghoff, Carl Gottlieb, Tamara Horrocks, Burt Cord, Roger Bowen and Kim Atwood plays ""Ko-Jon"".
  Gary Burghoff continued his role in the  M*A*S*H tv series that followed. G. Wood (General Hammond) appeared in the first 3 episodes.

MASH (1970) won the Academy Award for Best Writing for Screenplay - Ring Lardner Jr. Nominated for Best Picture, Supporting Actress - Sally Kellerman, Director - Robert Altman, Film Editing.

356659,4,6301777387,"In the Seventies, while the Hollywood mainstream foundered, the finest American films were made by Robert Altman... A natural outsider, he intuitively opposed the heroic traditions of Hollywood's seamless narratives to create a fresh, personal style and a consistently provocative critique of The American Dream...

Only with ""MASH,"" however, did his unique style first make itself felt... This seemingly chaotic black comedy, about a mobile army medical unit's anarchic adventures during the Korean War, made inventive use of a large cast, barely comprehensible multi-track dialog and a spontaneity of performance verging on the improvisational... But for all its gleeful mockery of conventional war heroics, the film (clearly intended to evoke the Vietnam War) was flawed by cynical clich; sadly, but perhaps not surprisingly, it remains Altman's greatest commercial success...",1168128000,3,879,5.813953488372093

Altman was always the enfant terrible, the outlaw of the fillmakers, following the steps of Billy Wilder (Stalag 17), Samuel Fuller (Crimsom kimono), Stanley Kubrick (Paths of Glory), Nicholas Ray ( Bitter victory) or Sam Peckinpah (Cross of iron), you may feel the dense irony that hovers and permeates all the script.

Because besides the laughs, funny situations, this intelligent humor accompanied the spectator far beyond the show is over.

356662,3,6301777387,"I first saw M*A*S*H when I was a sophomore in college.  This was 1970.  My friends and I thought it was a great flick. What did we know?  (Look up the definition of ""sophomoric."")

Now, almost 40 years later, I see it for what it was, despite its comic moments, e.g., the football game (""He has a sister named Gladys. Use it.""), Trapper's cache of olives, and the ""pros from Dover"" performing surgery in their golf shoes, knickerbocker trousers with argyle socks, and Corporal O'Reilly's gift of precognition.

However, this movie, along with its overrated TV series is an unabashed example of the ""Blame America First"" school of thought which permeates our entertainment community today.",1163203200,,688,4.947826086956522
356663,4,6301777387,"If you can do that, then Robert Altman's famous movie based on the popular book will please you. If you can't forget the actors and characters you saw for 11 seasons on the small screen, the 1970 film will not seem as good as it did when first released. Several of the characters in this film were deleted by the second season of the television version, and others were added, and new actors in the continuing roles obliterated memories of the film performances. It is still funny, but if you liked the TV show, seeing Robert Duvall as Major Frank Burns will be a ""major"" surprise. This is one of Altman's most accessible films, and its success changed American movies in some large ways. With the Iraq and Afghanistan wars raging, a movie that reminds us of the wounds, and the deaths, and the doctors who try to minimize both under horrid front-line conditions is not really dated.",1161993600,,883,4.594936708860759
356664,5,6301777387,"M*A*S*H is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#56) and is also on The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#7). It's considered to be one of, director, Robert Altman's greatest artistic achievements. The movie even inspired the hit TV show of the same name. I've never watched that show, so all this material is new to me. But this film deserves all the praise it got. This is a great film. Donald Sutherland (who looked a lot like son Kiefer Sutherland when he was younger) plays Hawkeye; Elliot Gould plays Trapper; and Tom Skeritt plays Duke. All the men are highly skilled Army surgeons, but they don't look like it. They frequently drink, play pranks on one-another, make jokes; Which, of course, pisses a lot of people off. When they're put into a tent with the overly-religious Major Burns (Robert Duvall), they do everything they can to get him out. When they learn he's having an affair with the new nurse (Sally Kellerman), they affectionately nickname her Hot Lips. True, most of the humor is sexual humor which will turn a lot of people off...But this is truly a classic comedy. It's funny, never dull, and all the actors are so good at playing these characters. Elliot Gould and Donald Sutherland in particular, are truly really good. I don't know how it holds up to the TV show, as I said earlier, but this is a great movie. See it.

The actor playing Hawkeye is a cheap man's Kiefer Sutherland, but that is the only bad part of the movie.  Robert Duvall once again does an outstanding job acting, playing Major Burns.  Elliot Gould and Rene Auberjonois show they have true Gritt!!  Also JoAnn Pflug keeps it real!",1152057600,,440,4.395061728395062
356729,5,6301777387,"It is a shame that the TV show went on to become such a hit, because to my generation, and anyone younger, thats all anyone associates the title to. M*A*S*H was actually a great American movie, in fact, one of the best, before it turned into that sappy, melodramatic, crap fest it turned into on seventies TV. I have suggested this movie to my peers, countless times, only to be responded with countless groans...""Wally, c'mon.. don't make us watch this..""

Oh man! You guys are all missing out. This movie is awesome! It is a comedy all the way, but it is a film also. Worthy of the academy.. and it's kick ass! Sharp and slick, and as another reviewer stated a few spots down, much to my delight.. offensive.

Now I know how some of you feel. I was forced to watch countless hours of the TV show when I was a kid. I hated it. Oh man, did I hate that show. I figured I'd hate the movie too, but I was way wrong. I first saw this film when I was around twelve, and instantly became a fan.

First of all the cast is stellar. And the characters are a lot different. Donald Sutherland plays a much cooler Hawkeye than Alan Alda ever could. Ditto Robert Duvall as Frank... and Elliot Gould as Trapper. The TV show didn't even have Trapper for more than a season, he was replaced by B.J... What a geek that guy was! Lets not forget Tom Skerrit, and Sally Kellerman.. the REAL ""HotLips"" Houllihan...

Exhibit Two: The theme song. How many nights have you turned off your TV, just because you can't bare to hear that awful theme song. Well, it's actually a song called ""Suicide is Painless"".. which actually has lyrics, and is actually a pretty great theme song to the movie. A little bit deppressing, but also a little inspirational at the same time.

Exhibit three: The book. Based on true stories from a man who was actually in a MASH unit during the Korean War. Richard Hooker. He despised the TV show as much as you and me. He considered it a disgrace towards his own work. I couldn't agree more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!! HIGHLY! and I am talking specifically to all of you out there who are not aware that it has very little in common with the crappy TV show.",1150329600,2,2166,4.338271604938272

In one scene, ""Hot Lips"" is exposed while take a shower to the entire camp. She helplessly crawls away naked, screaming, while the entire camp laughs and jeers at her. How can that be funny? This scene was boderline rape.

This movie was created by 60's counter-culture Hollywood to expose the horrors of the Vietnam war. That was accomplished, but the movies' creators exposed themselves as selfish, immoral, and hatefully disrespectful of women.",1146960000,16,606,5.446808510638298

Unfortunately, that point has been better made countless times before and since.  The fresh viewpoint that Hawkeye, Trapper John, and Duke really give us is into the empty soul of the 60's counter culture, a me-first attitude that rejects traditional morality and ridicules authority.  They seem to have no goals beyond the desire for immediate self-gratification and ""sticking it to the man"".  It's a depressing look at depressing people.

Still, the film chugs along, delivering a laugh or two here and there until the last half-hour degenerates into an amateur football game film, which was done better by ""The Longest Yard"".  When you realize that Donald Southerland has been out-acted by Burt Reynolds, you might as well turn off the tube.

It is just hillarious.  Yes, war is hell, but then laughter is the best medicine you know.  It keeps us alive.

  One of the most acclaimed comedies. M*A*S*H was about 3 surgeons in the Korean war trying to piece together the bloody bodies of mass distruction with the zany antics that helped keep their sanity intact.

Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt, Elliot Gould, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman and Gary Burghoff who played Radar O'Reilly in both the movie and TV series.

MASH was originally a book by Richard Hooker in the 1950's. The book followed a MASH unit in the Korean conflict. This new MASH concept was being used for the first time in the police action.  The MASH units had very high success rates, bringing hope to the GIs who fought there. The movie was a combination of antiwar sentiments against the Vietnam War, with the serious and deadliness of war and with the history of the MASH units in Korea. The movie touched many and was a first in it's kind in it's context and it's almost humorous point of view against war. It was unlike most of the war movies where they would show the heroes, but in actuality in war there are no heroes only dead and those scarred by it. This was a wonderful movie that cannot be copied.

356795,4,6301777387,"As the 1970's took off and Vietnam was well underway struggling Tv director Robert Altman put together one of the finest films of the decade. contrary to popular belief MASH takes place during the Korean war at an army hospital. Although the film doesn't always take itself seriously the themes of the film do.

The film is basically an anti-war film. the characters seem as though they have to be there and are never at any time letting the war go to their head. It displays the rebelliuos spirit of the 70's and might be the most well acted comedy of all time. Looked over on Oscar night in favor of PATTON, MASH is a superior film. It shows the bond of friendship and despite being a heilocopter ride form the front lines the team is never at on edge and anyone to seriuos is gone.

The question still to me: Is MASH a comedy or a dromedy. I feel the film and what it stands for but I've made up my mind that MASH is a comedy. A film that sugarcoats it's underlying message that war can never truly be ignored.",1123977600,,1013,4.270833333333333

356800,4,6301777387,"Though I do not agree with the politics of director Robert Altman, I am a great admirer of his artistry and most of all the independence of his from the cookie-cutter style of film-making that is prevalent in Hollywood.  Though he's hit more singles than homeruns, his films are rarely un-interesting.  One of the few times that he tackled a studio product, ""Popeye"", he made it seem like an independent film.  Those not familiar with the theme of this film or the long-running TV series based on this film, it involves the hi-jinks of a group of army surgeons during the Korean War trying to cope with the horrors that surround them.  This film does not so much have a story but a series of comic vignettes (the shower scene, the football game, etc.)  These comic episodes are effectively juxtaposed with the operating room scenes that illustrate why these surgeons have to engage in such outrageous behaviour; if they weren't laughing, they'd be crying.  Altman gathers an impressive cast here, many making their film debuts.  Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye, Elliott Gould as Trapper John, and Sally Kellerman as Hotlips are effectively funny in the leading roles.  Altman gives an excellent commentary here as he has done on other DVDs.  Altman states in his comments his distaste for the TV series that spun-off from this film.  I echo the same sentiment because I found that show pompous and sanctimonious.  I would have granted this film 5 stars but I dock it one because I find the suicide scene that parodies the last supper to be extremely offensive to my sensibilities.",1096329600,3,1577,4.825278810408922
356861,4,6301777387,"The passage of time has had interesting effects on the legacy of Robert Altman's 1970 war satire. On the one hand, you could point to ""M*A*S*H"" as an irreverent black comedy with serious political/social undertones; culmination of a sub-genre launched in the 1960s with Stanley Kubrick's pointedly satirical ""Dr. Strangelove"", and continuing with the more abstract European anti-war films ""King Of Hearts"" and ""How I Won The War"". On the other hand, you could also say that ""M*A*S*H"", with its generous helping of bawdy frat-boy sex pranks and expletive-rich insult humor (something American audiences hadn't seen much in major studio releases up to that point in time) also could have helped pave the way for the likes of ""Porky's"", ""Caddyshack"" and the ""American Pie"" franchise, i.e. the general ""dumbing down"" of Hollywood. (I have to chuckle at some of the younger reviewers making comments to the effect of: ""This movie is weird and boring-its not ANYTHING like the TV show..."" I rest my case.) ""M*A*S*H"" is the first truly ""Altmanesque"" film that Altman made- a huge cast, overlapping (and frequently improvised) dialogue, busy set pieces and a patented mix of high and low comedy. Also notable for launching the careers of Bud Cort, Tom Skeritt, Sally Kellerman, Michael Murphy, and at least a half dozen more actors whose names are credited with the phrase ""And introducing..."" The single-disc 2004 DVD version released by Fox features a sparkling widescreen transfer, decent sound and director commentary. Altman's commentary track is sporadic but worthwhile for film buffs.

Donald Sutherland (Hawkeye) and Elliot Gould (Trapper) are both brilliant as the crazy surgeons trying to keep sane among the chaos of war. The tone of the film is wilder than in the TV series, of the original movie cast only Gargy Burghoff (Radar) went on to star in the Tv version. These days I find I prefer Donald Sutherland's Hawkeye, Alan Alda's unrelenting niceness gets on my nerves a bit. In the film version there are two other surgeons who share Trapper and Hawkeye's anarchic activities, Duke Forrest and Spearchucker Jones (you will recall there was a halfhearted attempt to make Spearchucker a regular character in the early TV episodes, but he soon faded from view). I love the bit in the movie when Duke, a southerner is told they are going to be sharing their accomodation with a black surgeon and he remarks plaintively ""It's bad enough having to share with you two Yankees"". Uptight army nurse Margaret Houlihan is subjected to much rougher treatment than she gets on TV, as in the scene where her all is exposed when the doctors cause the shower to collapse while she's using it, in order to settle an argument over whether she is a natural blonde or not. Then there's the grand climatic football match, where some very dirty tactics are brought into play to make sure the M.A.S.H. team win. Dirtier, edgier and more cynical than the TV series, this is a very different M.A.S.H., but in some ways it's even better.",1090454400,7,1546,4.645985401459854

It was just plain funny, and the anti-military theme was subtle. Altman walked a brilliant tightrope between a pro-American and unpatriotic premise. There is no doubt that Altman intended it as an anti-Vietnam movie. It was written by former Communist Ring Lardner, Jr. Lardner had been Blacklisted, and this fact featured prominently in the politics of the film's aura. It was based on a sexy paperback novel about surgeons in Korea. The film was set in Korea, yet made every possible attempt to convey the image that it was actually Vietnam. Many of the movie's set pieces were deliberately Vietnamese in nature and costume, for that very purpose. To the extent that it was unpatriotic, it subtly described ""regular Army"" officers as unyielding, intolerant Christians, utterly blinded by stupid jingoism. The draftees, however, are funny and attractive as they drink and love their way through a bevy of good-looking nurses, all while saving lives in the style of comic Galahads. Altman showed genius as a filmmaker. The movie avoided real controversy because it was just so darn good.
""M*A*S*H"" spurred a television show that ran for years. In the 1970s it played for its time and audience. Re-runs, however, strain its credibility beyond Altman's original themes. Two doctors played the ""bad guy."" The first was a complete buffoon. Frank Burns was prominently identified as a Republican. He is given zero good qualities. He is ugly, a bad doctor, a coward, a racist and all-around mean SOB who cheats on his wife with Major Margaret Hoolihan, who at least is given some character. She is half-Vixen, half-Fascist, naturally Republican, a patriotic American in the ""worst way,"" who worships the idols of war. Over the years the writers gave Margaret a little development. Very little. Burns was replaced by Major Charles Emerson Winchester, a Boston Brahmin, naturally a Republican whose father ""knows Truman. He doesn't like him, but he knows him."" Winchester, like Hoolihan, is allowed a touch of humanity when the liberal writers felt charitable, but generally was available for all possible bashing. Two hero-doctors anchor the show by showing their intelligence, medical skills and tolerance as direct contrasts to the war effort. The CIA is lampooned, and a military effort that in reality featured MacArthur's Inchon campaign, perhaps the most brilliant invasion in history, is also played as foolish. In the end, the TV show and the film avoid being really and actually unpatriotic because they do feature an emphasis on the basic goodness of the American spirit under stress, but you will not catch me tuned in to those old re-runs(...)",1086480000,2,2792,5.125

356866,5,6301777387,"This is one of the finest films ever made, 'countercultural' or otherwise. It's antiwar, antiauthoritarian, irreverent, sacrilegious, and utterly without anything conventionally regarded as a Redeeming Feature.

It is, in short, a great, great piece of cinematic art. When it's over, not a sacred cow is left standing. And its antiwar satire, though full of wonderfully crass and tasteless comedy, is also quite serious and spot-on.

If you haven't read the book by 'Richard Hooker' (Dr. Richard Hornsberger), do so. It's a good book, and it's very different from the TV series you're probably familiar with if you were alive during the 1970s. The original tale centered on three surgeons, not two, and it wasn't (as the TV series became) a vehicle for the smarmy phildonahuing of sensitive-'70s-guy Alan Alda.

In fact the book and the movie are both 'racist' in the same sense as Mark Twain's timeless _Huckleberry Finn_ -- that is, not at all, but also not exactly designed to slip in under the radar of the PC Police, who wouldn't recognize _real_ racism if it bashed them in the heads with a billy club. (Likewise 'sexism'.) In developing the TV series, developer/scriptwriter Larry Gelbart toned a lot of this stuff down, but here in the film you can see it in all of its original glory.

And then some. The film actually partakes more of the spirit of Joseph Heller's great _Catch-22_ and, along those lines, develops the Hooker novel's mild irreverence to the level of a take-no-prisoners martial art. (The film officially takes place during Hooker's Korean War, but just as with the screen adaptation of Heller's nominal World War II setting, everybody knew the Vietnam War was the unofficial target. And at an abstract level, _M*A*S*H_ is a better screen adaptation of _Catch-22_ than the film version of that novel itself.)

Even other satire isn't immune from 'meta-satire'. This film was produced at a time when other countercultural books and movies regularly relied on Christian imagery (_Cool Hand Luke_, _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_, _The Omega Man_) to turn their central heroes/antiheroes into savior-figures. Here, Robert Altman and Ring Lardner, Jr., had the temerity to skewer even their artistic allies by turning the Painless Pole (John Schuck in his first major film role) into the central figure at a suicidal 'Last Supper'. (Even here, in thus expanding on Painless's suicide, they took a lead from the book's own irreverence. In the novel, the guys paraded around the South Korean countryside with a longhaired and bearded Trapper hanging from a cross.) _Nobody_ is safe around this cinematic buzz saw.

You probably already know who's in it, but I'd better give a quick nod to the marvelous performances by the Big Three: Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce, Elliot Gould as 'Trapper' John McIntyre, and Tom Skerritt as Duke Forrest. (I particularly call your attention to Skerritt, who seldom gets the credit he deserves for this role because -- under the influence of the TV series -- people tend to think the movie is mainly about Hawkeye and Trapper.) Everybody else is wonderful too, and I won't try to mention the entire cast by name here.

In general this rambling masterpiece isn't susceptible to easy summarization. So rather than try to tell you about all of the cool stuff, I'll just tell you to see it if you haven't done so already.

The DVD release is wondrous to behold. The movie is restored to perfect color and clarity and presented in widescreen format. The second disk has lots of cool features including cast interviews and stuff about the making of the film (and its groundbreaking cinematographic 'techniques').",1072828800,46,3668,5.001639344262295

356868,5,6301777387,"I watched this movie a few days ago, and I was blown away by it. It is probably the most unconventional film I've ever seen in my life. The movie is pretty much surgeons playing pratical jokes during the Korean War. That's it. And yet, it's more complex than that.
The film is better than the TV series, that's for sure. I love this movie. It had some great comedy (I mean, come on, who doesn't love the prank they did with Hotlips?), some interesting drama, and a LOT of cynicsm. Robert Duvall was my favorite actor in the movie, right next to the great Elliot Gould.
There were some scenes that confused me, but this is a movie that needs to be watched a 2ns, or 3rd time. It's very confusing if you don't know what the atmosphere was like in 1970. Just a great film, glad to have seen it.",1066262400,,791,4.2105263157894735
356869,5,6301777387,"Oh what a difference the decades make. This groundbreaking film, released in 1970, is inevitably found on everone's short-list of all-time greatest comedies. Director Robert Altman hit the bigtime with this one. And, many great films later, it's still widely considered his best. It should be seen especially by the young. Because it should be remembered that once there was a day when a film could be the director's personal vision, without regard for the social compacts of a given time. The 70's broke the written rules from before only to eventually succomb to the unwritten rules that were to follow.
At it's release, MASH was received as an overtly left-of-center showcase for the most urgent progressive causes: the anti-war movement, sexual liberation, integration, anti-authority, 70's style feminism.
The MASH version of feminism is particularly ironic. As in the later TV version, feminism is mostly expressed as a woman's ""empowerment"" to engage in promiscuous, premarital sex. Men and women engaged in open, frank and raunchy dialogue and interaction was then considered sexy, fresh, and indicative of the ""new lines of honest communication"" between the sexes. Today, men who talk to women as do captains Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland) or Trapper John (Elliott Gould) would be run out of the officer corps and sued for sexual harrassment. The famous Hotlips' (Sally Kellerman) shower scene would never make the final cut in today's Hollywood.
The liberal minded irony behind the handle ""Spearchucker Jones"" is now considered too subtle or esoteric to ever be trusted to modern audiences. A new movie would never risk such a character name in today's hyper-sensitive times.
The suicide-spoof scene is of a resounding political incorrectness. The linked lyrics in the original theme didn't even survive to see the TV series (which featured only the score). ""Irreverence"" in today's cinema is usually code for scatalogical humor.
The substance abuse/heavy drinking is portrayed off-handedly, incidentally and for comic effect. Today's director would need not even a prompt to self-censor himself through either: (a) direct, negative consequences for such behaviour, or (b) confining the imbibing to secondary, ""idiot"" characters.
The characters meant to show the Establishment's backside are only slightly more extreme than characters that are back on today's Good Guy rosters. In fact, some of the sanctimonious drivel from none other than Major Burns (Robert Duvall) is very similar to what, today, is uttered in all earnestness.
Like Welles' ""Citizen Kane"", Altman pioneered many fresh cinematic and soundtrack innovations here. Also, the viewer is flattered with nuanced characterizations and an absence of spoon-fed audience ""lessons"". More importantly, the viewer is presented a gut-splitting riot of comedic scenes that entertain throughout.",1064448000,9,2855,5.490909090909091

356933,5,6301777387,"Had Altman not given the people of Califonia a sneak-peek of M*A*S*H it would have been shelved and locked away in the Fox Vault, never to see the light of day.  But Altman, like each member of the M*A*S*H cast, was a rebel.  He and his cast and crew dared to tell the truth in a time when Hollywood was supposed to be a dream factory.
M*A*S*H is a black comedy that takes a stab at everything from the definaition of humanity and medical ethics to the reasons and methods of war.  5 miles from the Korean Front Line, the M*A*S*H characters are violently pushed to the brink.  Some break.  But others survive by pushing back with humor, love and blackmail.  The movie opens with the arrival of Hawkeye Pierce and Duke Forester at the 4077, a number that has been immortalized by the movie and the series that followed in it's footsteps, and follows them as they try and survive their tour of duty.
The bonuses on this DVD are outstanding and are well worth watching.  Make sure you have the time to soak everything in, because the interviews with Altman and the cast are filled with M*A*S*H facts that will amaze you.

356936,5,6301777387,"M*A*S*H is one of the zaniest and most intelligent satires ever produced by Hollywood.  This is a war movie in which only two shots are fired -- as signals in a football game.  It is a masterpiece of wider appeal -- even to veterans -- than is suggested by its setting in Korean War military hospitals, or by its director's explicit aim of promoting liberal opposition to the Vietnam war during the '60s and '70s.
The 2002 two-disk M*A*S*H special edition from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in many ways is a benchmark for DVD releases of cult movies.  Picture and sound quality are high.  The special feature content is entertaining and insightful.
This content includes extensive retrospective comment by director Robert Altman, producer Ingo Preminger, former studio boss Richard Zanuck, scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr, actors including Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Sally Kellerman, Tom Skerritt, John Schuck and Gary Burghoff, and medical veterans of the Korean War.  We see the 30th anniversary M*A*S*H reunion at Fox, and presentation of a studio life achievement award to Altman.
The special content gives fascinating insights into the driving half-mad genius that so often makes a great director, and of egos and bigheartedness in movie making.

Almost everyone, from the scriptwriter to the studio executives and the actors, lined up against the director at some time.  Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould once even tried to get Altman fired, fearing that he would damage their careers.  In the M*A*S*H special edition features they eat their words and graciously pay tribute to Altman.  Former studio boss Richard Zanuck says that until Altman came along other directors were afraid of the screenplay or didn't like it.  'Altman came in, and seemed unruly enough to be able to understand this subject matter.'
M*A*S*H was made on a shoestring budget with Fox's Century Ranch standing in for Korea.  It emerged from chaotic creative tension as an enormous artistic and financial success.  Altman accepted a salary of only $75,000.  His son Mike is reputed to have made more money from writing the lyric to the keynote ballad, 'Suicide Is Painless', with Johnny Mandel.  Altman kept costs down by casting the movie with mostly unknown and out-of-work actors.  14 of the movie's 30 speaking roles were played by actors making their screen debut.  Shooting finished three days ahead of schedule in 1969, and almost half a million dollars under budget.  M*A*S*H went on to earn more than $80 million at the box office, a Palme d'Or at Cannes and an Oscar (for the heavily reworked script of formerly blacklisted scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr), and to inspire a long-running popular TV series.
This is a rare thing: a five star classic movie in a five star DVD release.",1030147200,108,2781,5.06359649122807
356937,5,6301777387,"When most people think of ""M*A*S*H"", they often think of the 1970's television sitcom that ran for 11-years on CBS and continues to be aired in syndication to this day.  The series acquired and continues to maintain millions of fans, but many of the fans have never seen the original film that inspired the series.  The original film is much darker than the series.
From the 1960's atmosphere of cultural revolution, civil rights, the Cold War and anti-war sentiment exacerbated by the carnage of the Vietnam War, the director Robert Altman created a brilliant and realistic vision of the human tragedy of war in his film ""M*A*S*H"", but in a very humorous way.  Unlike its war film predecessors, ""M*A*S*H"" does not glorify generals, battles, or politicians.  Instead, ""M*A*S*H"" portrays the lives of doctors and nurses at Mobile Army Surigcal Hospital 4077 attempting to maintain their sanity while struggling to save the lives of the young soldiers fighting and dying in the Korean War.
""M*A*S*H"" opens with the well-known theme song, but it includes lyrics that may take many by surprise: ""suicide is painless, it brings on many changes"".  We then see the initial arrival of Captain Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (portrayed by Donald Sutherland) in Korea at a military airbase that is very dirty, muddy and gray.  When he arrives at MASH 4077, we see a very hairy Captain Francis Xavier ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (portrayed by Elliot Gould) sitting in the mess tent.  Hawkeye and Trapper John find their irreverance for the military and authority in common and become close friends as time passes, and that friendship is also shared with Captain Augustus Bedford ""Duke"" Forrest (portrayed by Tom Skerritt).  Duke was the only major film character that was not included in the TV series.
Two majors at MASH 4077 don't share the irreverance for authority that Hawkeye, Trapper & Duke have: Major Frank Burns (portrayed by Robert Duvall) who is often seen reading from the bible, and military-career-minded Major Margaret ""Hot Lips"" O'Houlihan (portrayed by Sally Kellerman).  On the surface, each of the majors is quite dedicated to their belief in the military, but the reality is that each is quite hypocritical.  They give in to their passions one night (Frank is married), but it does not go unnoticed; and Margaret earns her knickname of ""Hot Lips"".
In command of this motley group is the inept Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake (portrayed by Roger Bowen), who is assisted by the faithful company clerk Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (portrayed by Gary Burghoff--the only film cast member to play the same role in the long-running TV series).
The brilliant collage of scenes, including the bloody operating room scenes, and the stark cinematography create a powerful message from the mind of Robert Altman--war is a mixture of death, physical suffering and emotional torment, not all glory and honor.
If you're a long time fan of the television series and have never seen the original film, there is a good chance that you won't like the film; but if you're a serious cinema aficionado, ""M*A*S*H"" should be in your collection because it is probably one of the best films of all time.
The rendering of the film on DVD is very well done and the commentaries and documentaries on the second DVD are a great bonus.  I highly recommend this 2-DVD set.",1029974400,2,3353,4.991039426523297
356938,5,6301777387,"The Robert Altman style, so familiar to moviegoers over the last thirty years, was unleashed from the womb here.  The documentary-style camera work, laying back from the action but given license to zoom in and out as it sees fit, works its wonders best in the operation scenes.  Three tables of patients and doctors, all acting at once, and the camera still manages to capture every piece of relevant information, without making the whole mess confusing.  The overlapping dialogue, which I imagine gave those charged with subtitling the DVD version fits, works in much the same way.  No one would ever confuse ""M*A*S*H"" for anything but a Robert Altman film.
Despite the absence of battle, ""M*A*S*H"" is not devoid of blood.  The surgery sequences are filled to the brim with the red stuff, and serve as a stark contrast to the movie's more goofy comedic moments.  Sometimes within the same scene.  One notable example: Hawkeye, with a note of apprehension on his face, must saw off a wounded man's leg.  After a few strokes back and forth -- complete with cringe-inducing, nails-on-the-blackboard-style sound effects -- he asks the nurse for a clamp.  What for? she asks.  To scratch his nose, he cheekily replies, and the laugh they share perfectly diffuses the horrific moment.  This scene, to me, is ""M*A*S*H"" in a nutshell.
When thinking of the characters who inhabit ""M*A*S*H""s landscape I am reminded of the realization I had while watching George Cukor's ""The Philadelphia Story"".  It's a film that makes its audience root for the stuck-up rich girl and the spoiled rude millionaire layabout, two character types often cast in roles of villainy, while fostering resentment towards a man who earned his fortune by pulling himself up by his bootstraps, usually the hero.  It's a neat trick that that movie pulls off cleanly.  And so does this one.  Hawkeye, Trapper, Duke, et al., are terribly mean men.  They are type-A personalities all, unwillingly to accept anyone who doesn't conform to their lofty, intellectual standards, or their well-developed sense of anarchy.  But just as the humour of the film is a defense mechanism against the insanity of war, this cruelty also serves a purpose.  Anyone without a strong character and an affinity for the kind of team these men are building must be weeded out and destroyed.  It's this realization that allows the audience to sympathize with the tormentors rather than the tormentees.  And it allows you to let down your moralistic guard and like them just the same.
Still, there are some moments here that go so far over the line that even a liberal observer like myself, one who can casually accept immorality in movies because art must exist in an amoral state, gasping.  ""Can I still like these men, given their actions?"" I often found myself asking.  There are facets of the film that embrace casual sexuality bordering on harassment and casual racism worn as a badge of honour.  An example of the former is the way the men treat Hot Lips, ""army clown"" that she is, as an object of both desire and ridicule.  An example of the latter can be found in some of the self-imposed nicknames the men give themselves: Painless Pole, Dago Red, Spearchucker Jones, etc.  True, the obscenity of warfare is a much harsher villain than the obscenities the men practice ('obscenity' is too judgmental a word for my tastes, but I'll let it stand in the absence of anything better), which is why the film is allowed to go to such lengths.  But be warned that much here is designed to make the audience uncomfortable, and to question their beliefs.
Balancing this discomfort is a dramatis personae full of characters that are wonderfully likable despite their flaws.  Hawkeye Pierce is probably the most developed character, brought to life by some witty dialogue and some fine acting by then-unknown Donald Sutherland.  Hawkeye is a man of many mannerisms: he calls everyone ""Babe"", he's constantly hiding behind his downturned cap and thick spectacles, and, with apologies to Karen Silkwood and Woodward & Bernstein, he's cinema's greatest whistleblower, punctuating each moment with the same simple three-note phrase.  There's a casual elegance that Sutherland brings to Hawkeye (and every other role he's ever played) that shines through even the swampiest of settings here.  Elliott Gould's Trapper is a Zen-like shaggy dog, ravenous in his appetites but dedicated to his surgery.  Gould has a calmness about him that belies the man's manic nature, but it all fits together so well.  Hawkeye and Trapper are one of film's greatest subversive comedy teams; they seem to share a brain, so easily are their plans hatched and executed.
The rest of the cast, primarily made up of unknowns, are mostly spotless.  Duvall, as Frank Burns, brings dignity and composure to a man who is supposed to be inept as a surgeon and as a man.  Sally Kellerman is loud and abrasive and stiff as Hot Lips Houliahan, a woman who, despite her sexy exterior, is supposed to be loud and abrasive and stiff.  Tom Skerritt brings some southern charm, and a hint of incongruity, to Duke Forrest, Hawkeye and Trapper's cohort in cruelty.  Roger Bowen, Rene Auberjonois, Gary Burghoff, John Schuck and Bud Cort all get about the same amount of screentime, fill up the backgrounds admirably, and do yeoman's work when they're called to the front.
Robert Altman, a director whose work and style I've never been able to give my heart to, managed to craft a wonderfully satiric and entertaining little anti-war picture, that I can wholeheartedly endorse.  To top off this particularly tasty confection, he's added one of the most self-aware closing credit sequences ever put on film.  They are meta-credits, if you'll allow me to coin a phrase.  ""Attention,"" comes the squawk of the loudspeaker, ""tonight's movie has been 'M*A*S*H'.""  Before introducing the ensemble, Altman and Co. soften the blow and provide one final laugh.",1029110400,6,5940,4.960606060606061

356940,5,6301777387,"Whether it is the PG or R rated version, the classic anti-war comedy MASH is still a barrel of laughs. Not only was it an excellent film about the madness of war, it was also a comedy full of zany hysterics, and a social comment about the United States and England being involved in a war that neither country had no business being involved in. The 1970 film came out at a time when the United States was being blown apart in political and social upheaval, the massacre at Kent State University erupted, and films like Patton, Tora. Tora. Tora, Kelly's Heroes, The Ballad Of Cable Hogue, The Cheynne Social Club, Start the Revolution Without Me, Beneath The Planet Of The Apes, the re-releases of 2001:A Space Odyssey and The Wild Bunch, along with the X - rated comedy Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls, were hitting the big screens all across the nation.
Director Robert Altman, along with a cast that consists of Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, Rene Auberjonois, Robert Duvall, Fred Williamson, Gary Burghoff, and countless others make their mark on cinema history, with a film that really hits the subject of war on the dot. Not only is it an excellent film with explosive moments, it is also a film that pokes fun at the current state of war, and what people will do to survive such brutal madness.
If you enjoy war films and comedies, then come pay the MASH 4077th a visit. Not only is the film a classic, it is a film that started the Emmy-Award winning television series that made entertainment history.",1027814400,,1541,4.648351648351649

Poorly filmed (it looks grainy in parts), strained humor, Altman's usual messy direction (or is it his non-direction?), all conspire to create a film that was topical for about a month and then corny, and then over-the-hill. The tv series is funnier.",1027382400,8,291,4.84
357033,4,6301777387,"The title song sums up perfectly the mood of the film:
The game of life is hard to play;
I'm going to lose it anyway;
The losing card I'll someday lay;
So this is all I have to say:
Suicide is painless;
It brings on many changes;
And I can take or leave it if I please.
The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I'm beat;
And to another give my seat
For that's the only painless feat.
Suicide is painless;
It brings on many changes;
And I can take or leave it if I please.
And you can do the same thing if you please.
Robert Altman's seminal film gives us an inside look at how a group of surgeons at a military base during the Korean War cope with the reality of conflict and human violence. Suicide is an apt metaphor for the stepping outside of conventions (the American way, authority and regulations, morality) the soldiers undertake in order to deal with the harshness of war. They choose anonymity, opting to forget the outside world, instead forming their own society, the mechanics of which eschew authority and convention. Altman's characters lay aside obligations, loyalties, and traditional codes of conduct. Along with them, we almost forget that these are men with families and histories; that is, until the final moments when they, along with us, are abruptly brought back to reality as they prepare to leave and go back to 'ordinary life'.
The movie plays like a series of variations on this theme, many of the film's episodes functioning as allegories of human conflict and its corollaries. It certainly doesn't major on plot, but rather is sustained by a host of interesting characters, sharp and often hilarious dialogue and excellent performances. Altman brings a certain naturalism out of his actors, and impeccable timing in the more comedic moments.
It would be a mistake, however, to see the comedy as a trivializing of violence and death. On the contrary, this is a deeply serious film, whose tone is clear from the outset, where Johnny Mandel's melancholy rhythms and harmonies suggest pain beneath the comedic exterior. Throughout the film, tragedy is never far from laughter. Comedy has always been the vehicle of serious comment. So it is with M*A*S*H. Not only is the absurdity of war itself brilliantly satirized, but Altman takes a poke at how Hollywood has dealt with the subject. The score frequently recalls the kind of stirring, patriotic tunes heard in old war movies, only to offset the effect by highlighting the farce of war, smashing false notions of glory and romance to pieces. This is a highly introspective film, and several of Altman's touches are there to remind us of the power of film, and perhaps the responsibility upon the shoulders of film-makers. There are frequent references to the old war movies, reminding us that M*A*S*H, at least in the eyes of its makers, stands in a different category together, a new subset of the war genre.
It will be up to the viewer to decide whether Altman's new treatment of the themes of war and violence is really any more truthful than those of a few decades earlier. Some have found M*A*S*H merely offensive. Others have found it refreshing and astute in its perceptions. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1025222400,,3205,4.735241502683363
357034,3,6301777387,"I don't know how it happened, but somehow I never saw this film, nor did I ever see any of the television episodes which were based on it.  Of course, I had heard of MASH though and was looking forward to this video of the original 1969 screenplay. I expected to enjoy it completely.  WRONG!
Directed by Robert Altman, the screenplay was written by Ring Lardner Jr., adapted from the novel by Richard Hooker. It takes place in a medical facility during the Korean War and shows doctors working with war victims, saving lives daily in a primitive operating room. It's a comedy though, and everything is exaggerated, from the extraordinary amount of blood in the operating room scenes to the practical jokes these doctors play. They are often covered in blood and some of the scenes are not for the squeamish as they wisecrack and flirt and oppose military authority throughout, drinking and drugging and romping with the bimbo nurses.  It's all is supposed to be great fun.
Donald Sutherland plays Hawkeye and Elliott Gould plays trapper.  They are both surgeons who use every bit of their spare time partying.  Robert Duvall is also a surgeon but he sprouts dogmatic religious philosophy and blames others for his mistakes. Early on, he's eliminated after a practical joke that makes him and the head nurse, played by Sally Kellerman, the laughing stock of the company.  In one of the overlapping stories, the men cure a potential suicide victim who questions his manhood by letting a nurse use her body to cure him of his delusion.  And then there's a football game in which the MASH team wins by cheating.
I know this is all supposed to really be about the stupidity of the Vietnam War.  It's supposed to make us sympathize and identify with the hard-working doctors who have to put up with petty military rules.  It's supposed to be funny.  I even cracked a smile or two.  But I didn't laugh when they humiliated a nurse by exposing her nakedness while taking a shower.  I didn't laugh when the decision to commit suicide seemed an all-right solution for someone who thought he was gay.  I didn't laugh when the MASH team won the football game because they used hypodermic needles on the opposing team.  Instead, I raised an eyebrow and wondered about the mindset of people in 1969 -- when it was funny to see women as mindless, gay people has having to be cured, and drugs the answer to every question.  I, myself, would have thought it was funny then.  I don't now.
I can't really give MASH a bad recommendation.  After all, it was a classic in its time.  The acting was excellent, the timing of the jokes perfect.  And it certainly captured the absurdity of war.  It's an interesting historical study of America then.  And it's worth seeing for that alone.  But then was then.  And now is now.  I just can't help it if it's 2002.",1022284800,14,2835,4.624

357036,5,6301777387,"Although M*A*S*H is probably his most audience-friendly film, Robert Altman's style of over-lapping dialogue and multiple themes provokes a divided reaction even in this early work: you either like it or you don't.  Perhaps more significant, however, are expectations raised by the popular and long-running television series the film inspired: the series concerned likable characters playing situation comedy with a dramatic spin, and viewers who expect to see this repeated in the film will be disappointed--and very probably outraged as well.  Like most Altman films, M*A*S*H is character-driven, and there is no plot in any traditional sense.  In general, the film concerns three surgeons (Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke, here played by Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, and Tom Skerritt) who are drafted to serve in Korea.  Sharing a mutual fondness for martinis and a complete disrespect for all things military, they run riot through the M*A*S*H 4077, mocking the efforts of by-the-book military officers to make them toe the line and using the army's need of their skills to prevent higher authority from penalizing them for their antics.  Most of the characters (including the three leads) are at best unsympathetic, and the film's comic elements are deliberately grotesque, mean-spirited, blasphemous, sexist, and vulgar.
Altman clearly intends us to read the Korean setting as a metaphor for Vietnam and the disrespect for an inept military authority as a metaphor for America's increasing disenchantment with military intervention in Vietnam; at the same time, the film's graphic surgery scenes provide us with a clear vision of the human toll war requires.  Because the film mixes these points of view with comic elements, it is frequently described as an anti-war black comedy--but the film is so profoundly bitter that the word comedy, even when codified as ""black,"" is rather misleading.  There are certainly comic elements and even a few laugh-out-loud moments (most centering upon Margaret ""Hotlips"" O'Houlihan, brilliantly played by Sally Kellerman), but the tone of the film is so bitter that the laughter induced is very rueful indeed. Seen today, M*A*S*H feels slightly uneven in execution and very much of its place and time--but even so the cast performs with an extremely compelling immediacy and Altman's dark and multi-layered vision makes a powerful statement.  The DVD release features a superb restoration of the film, a rather dismissable director's commentary track, and four short documentaries re the film which are extremely interesting but often redundant.  Fans of Altman in general or this film in particular will find the DVD a must-have.  While I do recommend the film to newcomers, I offer the warning that response to the film varies considerably from individual to individual.  Whatever the case, M*A*S*H was and is a landmark film that deserves a place in any serious DVD library.",1016841600,3,2918,5.349344978165939

357038,5,6301777387,"Probably no cinematic comedy produced by Hollywood in the last half of the twentieth century is as irreverent, disdainful of authority, critical of war and its effects, and, incidentally, as funny as ""M*A*S*H"", that 1970 comedic masterpiece starring Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Gary Burghoff, and Sally Kellerman; written by Ring Lardner, Jr.; and directed by Robert Altman, in his directorial debut.

""M*A*S*H"" is actually a very difficult film to review for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, it's darned near impossible to provide an adequate synopsis for readers who've never seen the movie. Because, unlike most modern films that contain a linear story line, an easy-to-follow plot, and well developed characters that one can either root for or vilify with ease, ""M*A*S*H"" is a film that can only be described as a series of loosely joined comic vignettes, featuring a set of very true-to-life characters that are all BOTH very likeable and flawed.

""M*A*S*H"" is one of the best comedies ever made, and for good reason. It is genuinely funny. It is artistically produced; it contains great writing and acting; and it proclaims an important social message to viewers.

Having said all that, ""M*A*S*H"" is very likely NOT a movie that will appeal to everyone's tastes - even now, four decades after it was first released. How the movie was written and produced has a lot to do with that fact.

As the story goes, the idea for producing a movie version of ""M*A*S*H"" got its start when literary agent Ingo Preminger referred Dr. Richard Hooker's famous novel of the same name to 20th Century Fox executive Richard Zanuck. Zanuck enthusiastically supported the idea, hired Preminger as the movie's producer, and set out to find a screen writer and director. Ring Lardner Jr. (son of the famous 1930s sports writer) was brought in to write the script. Robert Altman was hired to direct. (As Altman tells it, he was about the ""13th choice"" of the studio to direct.)

Shooting began during the summer of 1969. At the same time, the films ""Patton"" and ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" were in production. Altman, eager to be successful in his first major film, decided to ""hide out"" on a back lot of the studio, where he would escape the watchful eyes of studio executives.

As a result, Altman was able to apply many innovative techniques to the film. He wanted his actors to improvise as much as possible in each scene. He wired each actor with an individual microphone and encouraged them to talk over one another. He incorporated several bloody operating room scenes in the film. He tried to mask the fact that the film was supposed to be set during the Korean War. He wanted audiences to assume that this was a film about Vietnam, and he wanted them to understand his clear message about the monstrosity of war.

(By the way, Altman's technique enraged Lardner, who thought Altman had basically thrown away the script. Lardner came perilously close to disassociating himself from the project, but in the end, accepted both the sole writing credit for the film... and the Oscar for Best Screenplay at the 1971 Academy Awards.)

Because of Altman's innovative (some say crazy) filmmaking techniques, ""M*A*S*H"" succeeds as a brilliant film that achieves almost all of Altman's goals. The film is deeply imbued with a lifelike realism that allows viewers to ""feel"" what it was like in the fictional 4077th MASH. The actors speak like one would expect them to when confronted with the reality of war and the boredom of inactivity.

Comedy scenes are uniformly uproariously funny, employing jokes and gags that range from subtle to coarse to borderline lewd. Interspersed with the comedy scenes are operating room sequences that are bloody to the point of horrific, but that bring home with full force the full brutality of war... so much so that, for a short time, the Defense Department banned ""M*A*S*H"" from being shown in military theaters worldwide.

I've read some reviews of ""M*A*S*H"" in which a criticism is leveled that the movie's characters are not well developed. I disagree with this judgment. I found I was readily able to identify with all the characters, whether they were likeable or not. Hawkeye, Duke, Trapper, Frank, Hot Lips, Henry, Radar, and all the others were completely believable, and fleshed out in detail... no small feat since the actors who played these parts were directed to perform their roles in such a highly improvisational manner.

""M*A*S*H"" is one of those rare films that gives viewers everything they could ask for from a great film: wonderfully realistic acting; a great script; brilliantly funny comedy; superb drama, important social commentary; and artful, innovative filmmaking techniques. ""M*A*S*H"" has steadfastly stood the test of time for thirty years, never becoming outdated or irrelevant. Whether you've never seen it, or, like me, you've seen it many times: make some time and check it out!",1015891200,117,4952,5.004860267314703
357039,3,6301777387,"The DVD's attractive packaging and the chance to see this important film in widescreen don't quite overshadow the fact that some of the extras here are nothing special.  There are two documentaries on the background of the film and much of the information is interchangeable.  Director Altman's audio commentary is disappointing; he seems uninspired, self-congratulatory, and what he says often has little apparent connection to what's on the screen.  Nevertheless, I don't want to sell this DVD short, again because it gives viewers a chance to view the film in a format that is close to what its creators intended.  Having seen old TV versions of the movie, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time.  Like many counter-cultural classics of its time, MASH doesn't always hold up well.  It is a matter of ""you had to be there"": first, the cast and crew were obviously having a hell of a good time, playing to each other and Altman, not to the audience.  In the context of Vietnam and free love, seeing this must have been exhilarating.  Now, some of it seems mean-spirited and no more progressive than the values its makers were mocking.  But, in the context of the current ""war on terrorism,"" the film has considerable power: its message is that war is a bloody farce in which every chance to get drunk or laid must be taken.",1015891200,5,1332,4.682403433476395

357041,5,6301777387,"Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"" is certainly an anti-war film in that it's set in an army hospital near the frontlines of Korea, and features battered bodies and at least once, a geyser of blood from a severed artery.  Its main characters, Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John McIntyre (Elliott Gould), find themselves patching together the battered remains of what were once young soldiers.

But in between marathon sessions in the OR, Hawkeye and Trapper John wage their own witty war against incompetence, confomity, hypocrisy and overbearing authority.  They carouse, drink and mercilessly bully anyone who gets in their way.  Their first target is Maj. Frank Burns (a memorable performance by Robert Duvall), an overly religious and self-righteous man given to blaming others for his mistakes.  Hawk and Trap set their sights on him and never let up, and, like its protagonists, ""M*A*S*H"" proceeds to take no prisoners.

There's no plot in the classic sense.  Things happen, the wounded come in waves, and our doctor heroes proceed to mock anything and everything that comes their way.  Sutherland and Gould are an amazingly funny team, quoting old movies and dropping into strange characterizations to meet every new challenge, be it recalcitrant regular Army nurse ""Hot Lips"" O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), befuddled CO Col. Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), or a football-crazy general (G. Bowen).

Among their schemes:  faking a suicide to give a friend back his self-confidence, blackmailing an officer to save a sick child, and bringing in a ringer to win the football game that makes up the movie's uproarious climax.  In between, we get to meet such memorable characters as ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burgoff), the almost-psychic corporal, ""Painless Pole,"" (John Schuck) the ""best equipped dentist in the Army,"" and Lt. ""Dish"" (Jo Ann Pflug).  Plus Swamp-mate Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt) and the ineffectual but well-meaning Father Mulchahy (Rene Auberjonois).

Altman packs the movie with dense, overlapping dialogue.  The result is chaotic, frenzied and hilarious.  Hollywood would never dare make a movie like this today, in which traditional values are so thoroughly and hilariously trounced; ""M*A*S*H"" is a truly dangerous and subversive film.  Its doctors (and ""M*A*SH"" itself, by extension) love only honesty, intelligence, freedom... and very dry mar-tin-eyes.  With olives!  Plus, the occasional nurse.

Finally, this classic has the treatment it deserves.  This ""Five Star Collection"" release (on two disks) contains a gorgeous widescreen version of the movie, Altman's commentary, the ""Backstory"" documentary, two other docus, and a restoration demo.

357103,5,6301777387,"MASH was a breakthrough movie on many fronts.
It was Roger Altman's personal breakthrough movie after several years apprenticeship in TV and smaller feature film work.  It was a breakthrough for the ensemble film format.  Yes, there had been successful ensemble films before this, but all were largely dependent on the ""All Star Cast"" format.  MASH represented the first major successful film, both commercially and artistically, that relied on an entirely on a relatively unknown cast.  And, finally, MASH broke through as the first major success as an anti Vietnam War vehicle to gain mass appeal.  In a way, it marked a major turning point in popular attitudes toward the Vietnam War.
Set during the Korean Conflict, MASH tells the story of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.  The MASH was an agglomeration of regular Army personnel and drafted civilian doctors unindoctrinated to-and often intellectually antipathetic towards, army practice and procedure and authority.
The movie graphically depicts the brutality of war, though it shows no actual war scenes per se.  (The only gun fired during the entire movie is when an official shoots a pistol into the air to mark the end of the period during a football game.)  What you see is an unending string of dead and horrible wounded soldiers brought to the MASH from the front to be worked on at the hospital.  Te constant scenes of battered and maimed bodies in surgery is sufficient enough to convey the horrors of the field of battle and the inherent cruelty and inhumanity of modern warfare.
One also sees the toll that is taken on the doctors and staff of the MASH unit itself.
The various mad-cap antics the doctors and staff engage in to blow off steam are hilarious and immensely entertaining yet there is a dark, unsettling edge to the humor.  You know that the fact that they are surrounded by insanity of all sorts and inhumanity of all kinds leads even the doctors-so disciplined and value driven in ordinary circumstances-into acts that are ethically dubious to the extreme.  It is definitely funny-it's also somewhat sad.
The resulted one of the best movies of all time and the very best antiwar movie ever made.

The story of a disobedient MASH unit at an army field hospital during the Korean War, it can be a perfect companion to Joseph Heller's Catch-22 for it's parody of war with paradoxes and irony. My particular favorite scene is the one were an intimate moment between an army major (Robert Duvall) and a army field nurse (Sally Kellerman) is broadcast live on radio at the base (That is also how the nurse gets the nickname ""Hot Lips""). However, some parts of this movie were just a little weird. One particular example is when the base dentist wants to commit suicide. He does so with a black capsule sitting down in a coffin as other friends of his crowd around and say good by to him while the song ""Suicide is Painless"" is sung. Another is the famous scene where the tent goes up around where ""Hot Lips"" is taking a shower.
Nevertheless, while insanely weird, often stupid and with some graphic surgeries and other ""activities"" at the hospital, this is still a great movie.

The rampant, idiotic sexism and ill-natured tone of the film is just sickening, not because of any duty to political correctness, but for the simple reason that a jerk is a jerk, no matter what the era(!).  And this film really is shockingly ill-willed throughout.  Trapper and Hawkeye (not to mention Skeritt's stomach-turning Duke Forrest) have to be among the most repulsive ""protagonists"" you'll ever see.  They aren't just ""anti-authority"", as the spun marketing would have you believe, they are just complete, utter, cretins.  Seriously, before the movie's half over, you'll be HOPING they get shot or hit by a bomb or something.  It's beyond belief.  This is certainly in contrast to the TV show, which was terrifically good-natured while still managing to portray hellish war conditions, and which I think was light-years superior to this ""original"".  All of the hype aside, this film is just so ignorant and offensive (sexism, racism, the hateful and angry tone, etc.) that I think its main, if not only, fans are primarily those who grew up with the film and are conveniently blinded by nostalgia.  Its ""popularity"" (if it even really exists anymore) will be infathomable to most modern viewers.  It makes for ugly, distasteful viewing, on many counts.

Altman's black comic masterpiece doesn't have a solid plot so much as a series of skits and sketches about life during the war.  From golfing 5 miles from the front to suspension of marital promises to trying to figure out why people are dying all around, M*A*S*H handles the gruesomeness of stupidity of war in the only way possible - if you're not laughing, then you're going to be crying, so it's probably better to laugh.

For being 30 years old, it looks great after Fox's extensive restoration and is presented in its original theatrical ratio of 2.35:1 with an anamorphic transfer.

Mr. Altman at the time had extreme left wing political views and used Korean as a stand in for the war that was raging on at the time in Vietnam.  By fusing the free love attitude of the counterculture and the lack of regard for authority of most of the 4077th's surgeons into a humorous film, he made light of things to hammer home his point that war is madness and people will do anything to cope.  M*A*S*H made stars of several young actors like Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould who played the two irreverent leads, Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre respectively.  Mr. Sutherland is the backbone of the film and his portrayal of the Hawkeye is superb.  Mr. Gould is extremely funny and glib as Trapper John.  Other standout performances include Tom Skerritt as Duke, Robert Duvall as the fanatical Frank Burns and Sally Kellerman as the uptight Hop Lips Houlihan.  Mr. Altman wasn't well known at the time, but after the huge commercial and critical success of M*A*S*H, he became a major player and went on to make several hallmark films.

This 2 DVD disk digitally remastered Widescreen (Letterbox)set has an extensive history and background information about the Korean War, Mash Units and the people who served during these difficult times.
Actually MASH was an Anti-War film against the Vietnam War, but was done very effectively to be a very Dark Comedy in a war time environment.  With the Humane Medical Teams showing the carnage of War through surgery and the horror of war and death.  The movie conveys the story, cast and war time setting very effectively so we can enjoy the black humor, sex and horror.  We get the message wihout the anti-protesters in our face.  We see how war destroys us one way or another.
Summary: The 4077th M.A.S.H. Unit is stationed 3 miles form the Korean front lines.  The Cast of characters are drafted Medical Personell that find a way of serving and existing in this environment through humor, defying authority, sex and friendships.  This movie is fast paced, a highly intense drama/comedy which allows us to enter the combat front through the humanity of medicine and the miracle of life.  The cast is outstanding!
You must see this movie.  It is a historical statement of 1970 and it remains a timeless classic!  After all, in 1972 a TV series evolved and remained in our lives for 11 seasons and now in reruns.  Enjoy.",1010966400,5,1737,4.808080808080808
357199,5,6301777387,"When I first saw M*A*S*H the movie on TV after being a fan of the series, I didn't like it much. Upon repeated viewings it began to grow on me and over the years has become one of my favorite films. In fact, I bought a laserdisc player in 1995 just to be able to own a widescreen copy of it. Seeing it in widscreen was like seeing it for the first time. Seeing it this past week on the DVD brought the same experience. Both picture and sound restoration are simply marvelous and bring a fresh appreciation to a film I have seen at least 50 times. There are plenty of extra features. I too was a little disappointed in Altman's commentary but it does not spoil the overall package. A five star film, a five star DVD set.
This film ain't for everyone. It has no conventional story line and the overlapping dialogue may require reapeating viewings to pick up everything--although I still get something new everytime I see it. It's gory, sometimes mean, sometimes crude and sometimes slapstick. Drop your paradigms on movies, forget what you know and expect about film, forget the TV series, and just enjoy the experience. Give it a chance. You may hate it at first but if you are somehow drawn to it as I was, give it another chance. It just may grow on you. And one day you too may realize that Altman created one of the most brilliantly made films ever. There is nothing else like it. Now if only I could see it at the theater on the big screen.",1010880000,2,1444,4.3125

357202,5,6301777387,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Imagine the TV show pushing the envelope of humor with rampant dirty jokes and sex.  I despised the TV show.  The movie rocks, so smart it makes today's comedy look like uninspired folly.",1009324800,4,231,4.585365853658536
357203,5,6301777387,"To my mind, the Seventies begins here.  Altman's film bottles pandemoneum by ditching plot for character study, pacing the film as vignettes of comic insanity, allowing an ensemble of incredibly talented actors to step all over each other's lines, uses a witty script not as a guide but as a departure point for some incredible adlibbing, and isn't afraid to put the brakes on the comedy and fill the screen with blood.  The result could've been a royal mess, but really turned out to be inspired, kicking off a decade of cinematic innovation.  You can read an anti-war subtext into this film (and many have) but M*A*S*H ultimately jabs at what happens when incompetents are running things, which no doubt parallels Altman's views of Hollywood and pretty much everything else (and for me, the past eight years, but that's another story).",1002585600,4,837,4.921985815602837

357205,5,6301777387,"It be hard to say watch the film first and then the series because it seems most people did the reverse. You have to remember that the movie version seemed more realistic and less comical because the 1970 movie was thumbing their noses at the US government for the Vietnam war. Also the tv series was just picking on Frank Burns and then picking on Charles Emerson Winchester III. The film was great and dserved to be on the AFI 100 List for Comedy and General List. This movie needs to be preserved on DVD as soon as possible. Also if you only saw the PG version of the movie, you cheated yourself rent or buy the rated R version.

357319,1,6301777387,"Well, I have to say, ""Suicide is Painless"" is a really great song, even more so when performed by the Manic Street Preachers. But the film itself...um. Okay, so it was very rarely funny. That in itself isn't necessarily a deadly sin. But...man alive, the breathtaking misogyny of the whole affair! Christ almighty (allegedly), am I the only one who found all the ""Hot Lips"" stuff beyond offensive? Is this funny? Was it EVER funny? Am I meant to be amused? In the seventies--maybe. I wasn't around then. But this, gentlemen, is the nineties, and this sort of supposed humour is simply not tolerable in this day and age--indeed, I'm somewhat baffled by the fact that, in my cursory inspection of the other reader reviews, nobody seems to have even MENTIONED this, given that it more or less spoiled whatever good qualities the film might have otherwise possessed. It elevated the main characters from the status of bland to actively repulsive. You people aren't bothered by this? Geez. What's good about the film other than the theme song? Well, as a sometime DS9 fan, it was sorta cool to see Rene Aberj...I'm not even going to TRY to spell that. But I liked seeing him. Other than that...I'm kinda drawing a blank. The film may have been groundbreaking and all that in its time, but now it's just embarrassing.
Addendum: Tsk, tsk...looks like some people can't stand having their sacred cows slaughtered thusly.  Actually, looking back on it, I think I was too lenient with the film.  By fixating on the one standout misogynist bit (though it would've been hard not to, given how shockingly offensive it was), I may have downplayed the film's overall unpleasant nature.  About as funny as a minstrel show.  One star.",962323200,14,1717,4.79054054054054
357320,5,6301777387,"But then it probably isn't fair to be comparing the movie tothe TV show, since both have their own merits on their owngrounds.
""MASH"" the movie is indeed a stirring look at the insanities of war and the resulting humor. Skerrit, Sutherland and Gould yuck it up as ne'er-take-seriously surgeons, and Robert Duvall is great as stiff religious Major Burns, a real jerk of a guy. Plus, Sally Kellerman is a hottie. The ""Suicide is Painless"" scene is eerie.
For those expecting the TV sitcom, the movie will appear to be completely different.  But watching the scene where Burns and Houlihan go at it, and the boys slip a microphone into their tent, you're know these are the same characters you've always loved- they just look a little different.
And if you squint, Donald Sutherland kind of looks like Alan Alda.",960854400,4,809,4.73758865248227
357321,4,6301777387,"This was one of the most brilliant, insightful, funny, poignant, compelling and sad movies I have ever seen.  Every scene, which was a fragment, was much like Vietnam itself, fragmented, something to get  through one day at a time, hopefully. One then hopes they have no  recollection of the day before. (I am aware that the movie takes place in  Korea, but it is a social commentary on Vietnam). Another thing that  strikes me is how sensitive and touched the characters are; even though  they try not to feel [or convey a sense of emotionlessness] and comedy is  the release for all the emotions pent up during the day.  There is no other  way to describe it but as a satire of survival, (emotional, mental,  physical).  The only thing that may have made it better would have been to  include another fragment on the end.  You must rent it and savor it.",940291200,6,855,4.546052631578948
