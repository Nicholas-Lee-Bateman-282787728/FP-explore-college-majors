8275894,5,B001A3GLYU,"Wow, fantastic history lesson, especially suited to this 65th anniversary of the modern establishment of the State of Israel!!  All Israelis, esp. those with anti-Christian bias should most definitely see this film!  Help get the facts straight!  Pardon the perhaps overly generous use of exclamation points in this review, but this is a great documentary!",1366588800,3,356,5.4363636363636365
