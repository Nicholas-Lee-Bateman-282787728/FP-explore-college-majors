8035787,5,B00030JOZO,Armand LaMontagne is an American woodworking and art hero and deserves our attention and admiration. We need more like him. As a craftsman I recomend this to all woodworkers and artists as he is as important to us as any great leader in these fields.,1243209600,2,250,4.5777777777777775
