7974968,5,B00007CVRI,"One could liken this venture to the Christmas Truce of 1914 where Allied and German soldiers fraternized in No Man's Land. Similarly, 1983 was the worst year in the war between Karajan and the Berliners - and yet come All Souls Day in November, they could not be any chummier. Always a weathervane in these Sony DVDs, Herbie looks relaxed and resolute. Sartorially dressed, is that a Blue Max attached to his bow-tie as a tribute to the old days . . . . . ?  Who is to say?

As expected, this is a stupendous performance of Opus 64 by the man who, with due respect to Bohm and Kempe, put Eine Alpensinfonie on the map. Where does one start? That it attains Fahrenheit 451? That Strauss is promulgated as visionary if not mystic? That the thunderstorm evokes primordial chaos? What a joy it is to see and hear this herculean orchestra as it devours such a score, bones and all. The opulence of tone - yes, the Klang - is breathtaking. Given their prodigious expenditure of energy, the Berliners warranted a hose-down afterwards (indeed, sweat is evidenced throughout - hopefully someone passed a Gatorade to Gerd Seifert who looks ever so knackered).

The camera-work is more sympathetic to the orchestra than usual. Ever so thankfully, the tiresome practice of filming instruments alone to the exclusion of players is minimal: one sees flesh and blood. Herbie spurns the Captain Bligh within: on this occasion at least, he has not bewigged the legion of bald badgers. Anything less than 90% of the focus being allocated to Karajan is a victory of sorts: that's the case here. Other than a couple of shots featuring the double-basses, the footage was taken directly from the concert itself. Sabine Meyer, she who launched a thousand ships, is a participant.

Karajan maintained that the three-part epilogue is profundity itself. I concur. And the look on his face says it all as night descends. We have had our vision.

This does not displace the legendary studio account of 1980 but of course it's a different experience per se. In its own right, it's a barnstorming, bomb-them-back-to-the-Stone-Age performance. The sound is sensational. It's arguably the best of Karajan's late videos. How it resonates! Climb and ascend!",1420416000,2,2223,4.854881266490765
7974969,4,B00007CVRI,"One of the reasons I bought this DVD of Strauss` Alpine Symphony was because I actually wanted to see someone playing the heckelphone. This is a very rare baritone woodwind which Richard Wagner suggested, but which did not materialize until 1904, some 20 years after his death(courtesy of Germany`s Heckel firm, a bassoon manufacturer). Wagner disciple Richard Strauss wrote for it soon after in his operas Salome and Elektra, as well as Eine Alpensinfonie.
  But alas, despite this being a German orchestra playing in Berlin, there is no heckelphone player present. Why ?
  Just about everything else the score calls for is onstage, including two harps, a celesta (a small keyboard instrument made famous by Tchaikovsky`s ""Nutcracker""), and the organ. The wind machine (or aeolophone) which a previous reviewer mentioned is, along with the thunder machine, not present because these sound effects have been electronically replaced in the modern era with tape recordings of actual wind and thunder. The french horns can be seen switching over to tenor Wagner tubas as called for, but why does Karajan employ five trumpets when the score only calls for four ?  Also, the score requests two regular bass tubas, but I could only spot one. Finally, the twelve horns, two trumpets and two trombones which are supposed to be played offstage are apparently ignored altogether.
  Perhaps these are inconsequential matters to most, but I am curious about unusual instruments and could not help but notice such details. I can`t believe the famous and august Berlin Philharmonic was having budget problems.
  This is of course not really a symphony, but more of a tone poem, and a good imagination helps to understand just what Strauss was trying to do. That and a familiarity with the titles of each of this work`s different segments can provide for a much more rewarding listening experience.",1145404800,3,1883,5.087662337662338
7974970,4,B00007CVRI,"This is my first Karajan DVD experience. The first shock I got watching this DVD is the hue/saturation of the picture. I never thought the floors of Philharmonie looked like Mahogany of some sort. The whole picture has a darker hue compared to previous videos of Philharmonie where it has light and bright hue.
On the other hand, the sharpness of the picture pleasently surprises me and the sound is top-notch, especially with Dolby Digital 5.1 feature. I own Karl Bohm's Eine Alpensinfonie and no doubt I look forward to Karajan's interpretation.
Throughout the whole film, thankfully the strings did not dominate the orchestra as usual, although the winds are still a bit weak and rarely distinctive. I still relish Bohm's version where the winds are prominent and characterful and his ""impressionistic"" treatment of each movement. In this film, I don't hear the clarinets imitating the Scottish bagpipes in ""The Ascent"" and the horn fanfare are too loud in the same movement whereas in Bohm's version, there's an offstage effect. To sum it up, whereas in Bohm's version, he scales the Alpine heights with his listeners, Karajan merely observes and imagine how he did it from afar.
However, Karajan makes it up with weight, drama and extra ""oomph"" that Bohm's version lack. I would advice you to own this DVD just for the ferocious Thunderstorm scene. There's also the usual richness of the Berliner's strings to look forward to.",1086480000,4,1431,4.99163179916318
7974971,5,B00007CVRI,"This is the best recording of Richard Strauss' Alpine Symphony.
Here's why:
It is a stunning piece of music--an auditory journey up an alpine mountain, complete with sunrise and sunset, and even an impressive, powerful mountain storm.
Herbert von Karajan shaped the Berlin Philharmonic into perhaps the best orchestra ever.  Von Karajan shows how, like a musician, a great conductor ""plays"" an orchestra as if it were his instrument.
This DVD allows you to see, up close, the conducting details and nuances of body language which get so much more out of the orchestra.
The DVD format also allows you to check back with the program titles to verify what the music is describing.
The photography and sound recording could not be better.
You will have a better seat, a better view, than anyone at any concert.
This is an opportunity to see a great conductor perform a great musical work on his personal instrument, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.",1079481600,6,946,4.949685534591195
7974972,5,B00007CVRI,"This DVD recording of the Alpine Symphony by Strauss is amazing. Having had his release on the Karajan Gold edition for a while, I thought it would be good to pick up yet another Karajan interpretation.
The Berlin Philharmonic play beautifully especially at the section following the storm. Karajan appears to be completely overcome by the passionate BPO strings. I would dare say Karajan gave this music his all to prove how valuable this piece is in the repetoir.
The storm sequence is wonderfully played. I wish the cameraman could have captured a shot of the wind machine...as i have never seen one before. Other than that though there are some fabulous shots of Karajan's conducting, strings, brass, woodwinds, ect. The only neglected section is the percussion section. The picture appears clear, and the sonics are great in my opinion.
The music itself really packs a wollop and deserves to be played on a quality surround sound system. This is my introduction to the Karajan Legacy Series and i am very impressed with this recording of the Alpine Symphony.",1051660800,11,1063,4.944134078212291
