8253349,5,B0013XZ6XO,"This was another great quality show of the early 1950s ... I really enjoyed the Dove Soap and Old-Spice commercials ... DVD Picture quality was great, once you realize/consider that the show is 55+ years old ... Audio was clear and of good quality ... I only wish there were more than 4 episodes out ... I would enjoy getting the whole single season of the show ... Good job Alpha Video",1294185600,2,386,4.375
8253350,4,B0013XZ6XO,"Running only one season, THE EVE ARDEN SHOW was Ms Arden's followup to the hugely popular ""Our Miss Brooks"", a character she'd had the unique opportunity to play on radio, in film and on television.  On the subsequent EVE ARDEN SHOW, Arden played Liza Hammond, a widowed  authoress who lives in a New York apartment with her twin daughters (Gail Stone and Karen Green), and mother (Frances ""Aunt Bea"" Bavier).  Allyn Joslyn is Liza's manager George Howell, and Willard Waterman has a recurring role as the landlord.

Stories typically revolved around Liza's career as well as the problems encountered in raising two boy-crazy teen girls.  By all accounts the ratings were never satisfactory and THE EVE ARDEN SHOW wasn't renewed by CBS.

As was also the case in the earlier ''Our Miss Brooks"", Desilu was the company responsible for putting the whole project together; Arden having first worked with Lucy, Desi and the Desilu gang on one of the Season Four 'California' episodes of ""I Love Lucy"".  Arden's personal friendship Lucille Ball went back to the 1930's; and, as legend goes, it was Ms Ball who suggested Arden for the role of Miss Brooks, having first been approached for the part herself!  In 1967, Desi Arnaz coaxed Eve Arden back into primetime with ""The Mothers-in-Law"".

Episodes:

""Liza's Nightmare"" - Called away to Washington where she's to give a speech, Liza's mind races with all sorts of guilty thoughts about leaving one of the twins sick at home with a cold.

""White Elephant Sale"" -  When the girls start developing a strong friendship with PTA president Mrs Kenyon, Liza is given the cold shoulder.  She decides to use the school's annual White Elephant sale as a means to get even!

""Cover Girl"" - Liza suddenly becomes a hot property in New York dating circles when a doctored photo of her is printed on the paperback edition of ""Summer's End"".

""It Gives Me Great Pleasure"" - George books Liza on the lecture circuit, despite her pathological fear of public speaking.  This was the official first episode.

All four episodes include the original sponsorship bumps (Dove Soap, Old Spice shaving products and Imperial Butter).  Picture and sound quality is strictly average but classic TV collectors will just be happy having ANY remnant from this otherwise-forgotten series on DVD.  Thankyou Alpha for resurrecting it.",1282780800,11,2346,4.969230769230769
8253351,1,B0013XZ6XO,"The picture was very grainy and looked as if it had been made from an unrestored 50+ year old copy of the show.  Save your money if you're looking for a clear, crisp picture and sound.",1278892800,,184,4.111111111111111
