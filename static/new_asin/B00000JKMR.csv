7912254,4,B00000JKMR,"what is there really to say that has not already been said about flair,WOOO,the only reason i give this video 4 stars instead of 5 is because the majority of it takes place in the era where he was being used under the NWO,and hogan,but its still great,good highlights of his matches with the stinger,the 4 horsemen,and matches that when you see them now you'll realize how much we took it for granite because of the nwo,goldberg.etc...,the war games where hennig (rip) turned and gave him the cage door to the head,his return in '98 with the horsemen,and unfortunately the bad use of this angle where it was actually his turn to take out the nwo,ive always thought he has been owed a main event match against hollywood hogan with a figure 4 pin-win,my overview is you see how he is soooo good at pushing the opponent over...but can always beat whoever hes in there with,buy it....HOLLA... if ya hear me!",1136073600,,903,4.614906832298137
7912255,5,B00000JKMR,RIC FLair is THE GREATEST WRESTLER EVER.THIS VIDEO ISN'T Long ENough this MAN Has FOrever Changed The Game. His Style&Ability too Still Be the Man in the Game For SO Long is Truly Amazing. 4 HorseMan Ruled The 80's. RIc was  The Leader. He is Still The Baddest. SPace Moutain for Life  WOOOOOOOOOOO!,961891200,,299,4.622641509433962
7912256,3,B00000JKMR,"This video is filled with recent(1999)inter veiws but not much in the way of wrestling. I gave it 3 stars because there is no COMPLETE matches just clips from pay-per-veiws. It does have alot of behind the scenes info from  the Nature Boy in re gards to Hogan,Savage,Bishoff and others.",961545600,,286,4.72
7912257,3,B00000JKMR,"THIS VIDEO DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SHOWING WHAT THE NATUREBOY HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH FOR THE PAST 2 OR 3 YEARS, BUT COME ON LETS BE OHNEST, HOW CAN TAKE A CAREER THAT HAS LASTED FOR 27+ YEARS AND PUT IT ON A 60MIN TAPE.  I KNOW THE WCW MAY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE LAST FOUR YEARS, BUT THIS TAPE  ONLY GIVES YOU A GLIMPSE OF WHY RIC FLAIR IS THE GREATEST WRESTLER OF ALL  TIME.
THIS TAPE HAD ALOT MISSING, FOR ONE FLAIR'S ENTIRE NWA HISTORY,  HOW CAN YOU DO A TAPE ON FLAIR AND NOT EVEN MENTION HIS FEUDS WITH DUSTY  RHOADES, HARLEY RACE, TERRY FUNK, RON & JIMMIE GARVIN, FOR HEAVEN'S  SAKE THIS TAPE BARLEY MENTIONED FLAIRS FEUD WITH RICKY STEAMBOAT.
DON'T  GET ME WRONG THE TAPE DOES HAVE ITS GOOD POINTS, ALL I'M SAYING IS IF YOU  ARE GOING TO DO A TAPE OF RIC FLAIR, YOU GOT TO DO MORE THAN JUST PULL SOME  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THROW IN SOME MORE HORSEMEN INTERVIEWS  AND ATTACKS, TALK ABOUT HOW HE WAS THE FIRST MAN TO WIN THE WCW,NWA, AND  WWF TITLES, (AND TECHNICALLY SPEAKING SINCE HE WAS NEVER DEFEATED FOR THE  NWA, AND WCW TITLE BEFORE HE WON THE WWF TITLE, HE IS THE ONLY MAN TO HOLD  ALL 3 TITLES SIMOTANIOUSLY.)
RIC FLAIR IS THE MAN, AND HE HAS MEANT SO  MUCH TO SO MANY OF US OVER THE YEARS, AND DOING A ONE HOUR TAPE ON HIS  CARRER JUST IS NOT DOING HIM JUSTICE. HE IS TRULY THE GREATEST WRESTLER TO  HAVE EVER LIVED,HE IS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN HOGAN COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.  WRESTLING WOULD NOT BE AS GREAT AS IT IS TODAY IF IT WAS'NT FOR THE  DIRTIEST PLAYER IN THE GAME, THE LEER JET FLYING LIMOSINE RIDING,KISS  STEELING, WHEELING DEALING SON OF A GUN.  FLAIR IS THE BEST, BUT THIS TAPE  SHOULD BE BETTER, AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE!  WOOOOOOH!",953251200,,1672,4.064417177914111
