7811866,5,6301374118,"I might be biased but I love this movie.  Yes certain things fall short of the artistic vibe this was going for since they kind of come off pretentious and cheesy, but overall I love the look and feel this managed to accomplish.  It's kind of melancholy, dark, and yet beautiful.  The visuals are really nice and make me wish they would release this on Blu-ray (I do have an Italian release of the DVD, but the dubbing kind of ruins the mood and it is a region encoding that makes playing it a challenge).

Of course a large part of the enjoyment also comes from Brigitte herself, this is by far the hottest I've ever seen her look on film (she was a few months pregnant so it makes her a lot more of a bombshell, incredibly stacked top and bottom).  Some full nudity of course but also some really sexy clothing - and the scene that gets the most erotic with some self-love is performed in a lace catsuit and you can still see a lot, very stimulating.",1424131200,,952,4.266666666666667

7811869,4,6301374118,"My copy came from Italy, and seemed to take a while to arrive...  But it arrived in perfect condition.

I've been a fan of this movie for years - love the artsy style (which is often why people don't like it).  However, the whole movie is dubbed in Italian, which might be ok if I could at least turn on subtitles but there don't seem to be any (and I haven't got around to learning Italian yet).  And, dubbing rarely keeps the tone and delivery of the lines intact, which is a reason I usually don't like it (Bruce Lee's Return of the Dragon is one exception).  However, since this seems to be the only DVD version available, it's nice to have for the visual aspect at least.  Maybe I can watch it simultaneously with the VHS copy's audio, ha ha.  Brigitte Nielsen is super hot here - I understand she was actually a few months pregnant when she made this, which helps her figure look natural (think Marilyn Monroe).  I'd love to see more highly stylized movies like this, that are beautiful to look at.  The score is good too - all the jazz insertions were a really cool touch.  And obviously this is quite a sexy movie, not for children... again something I enjoy about it.

I also noticed a scene or two that wasn't in my VHS copy, so that was a nice surprise (apart from, again, not understanding the dialog in Italian).  I'd love to see this released on DVD in its original English but with special features (commentary, multiple subtitle options, behind the scenes, extra scenes, etc).  But I'd be happy if they just put the movie on a DVD by itself and no extras at all... just so we fans don't have to wear out our VHS copies.",1320364800,2,1635,4.338815789473684
7811870,1,6301374118,"This movie has been called ""drama"" as well as ""erotic thriller"". But it really doesn't belong in any genre at all. It has no plot, at least none that makes any sense or will keep you interested. The filmmakers try desperately to create stylish sets and lighting, but it only feels really pretentious, just like most of the long, pointless scenes with dialogue that make no sense and that add nothing to the non-existing plot. The movie has a couple of erotic scenes with Brigitte Nielsen, but it's nothing that is worth the pain of watching the rest of the movie.<...",1036108800,2,567,4.623762376237623
7811871,3,6301374118,"Simply put, this movie has one thing going for it, Brigitte Nielsen.  She acts fairly well, considering that the film makes no sense whatsoever.  She dresses up in lots of tight outfits and then takes them off.  Basically,  it's 90+ minutes of looking at Brigitte Nielsen in various states of  undress.  As she looks really good, this is a plus.  The film itself is  somewhat stylish, but makes absolutely no sense at all.  If you're a  Brigitte fan, it's worth the money.  If you want to actually watch a movie,  steer well clear!",957916800,10,531,4.591397849462366
