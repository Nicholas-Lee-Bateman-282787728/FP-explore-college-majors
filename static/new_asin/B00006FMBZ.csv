1751794,5,B00006FMBZ,"There is very little about this DVD not to like. Every care was taken to record this county legend at his best. One cannot help but be impressed with the versatility of Ronnie Milsap as he cranks out the favorites of not only his own recordings but those of others. His renditions of Jerry Lee Lewis, Ray Charles,Little Richard and others is superb. I had the pleasure of seeing him in concert and can only say I would have gladly went back the next night and the next if he had only stayed in town. One thing not mentioned online in the specs on this DVD is it is in Surround Sound which only adds to enjoyment.  Buy this DVD, you will not be dissapointed.",1118275200,6,657,4.256
1751795,5,B00006FMBZ,"Ronnie Milsap has been around for well over 30 years, and he still looks and sounds as great as ever...maybe even better.  In this live concert video, he performs many of his best-known hits, including ""Lost in the 50's Tonight,"" ""Smokey Mountain Rain,"" and ""Stranger in My House,"" to name a few. (Milsap has had 40 #1 hits during his career.)  There are also a few surprises, like when he harmonizes with his band on some acapella do-wop songs.  Listen for Ronnie to tell his stories about how he worked with Elvis Presley, and Ronnie's humorous story about why he prefers to play the piano rather than the guitar.  Stay tuned in the end for an in-depth personal interview with Ronnie.  You will not be disappointed.",1092096000,17,717,4.658730158730159
1751796,5,B00006FMBZ,"From start to finish, you're totally captivated by the LIVING LEGEND, Mr. Ronnie Milsap.  He performs many of his #1 Hits, a ""street corner doo-wop"" session, four Standards (including ""My Babe"" and ""My Funny Valentine"") backed with full orchestra, and a special tribute to his favorite ""piano men"" (including Ray Charles, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard and Floyd Cramer).  He closes the show with ""America the Beautiful"" to a standing ovation.  From start to finish, Ronnie is pumped, interacting with an energized audience and joking with band members.  You're also treated to a 30 minute interview where Ronnie disusses his career (from beginning to present), personal life, and future plans.  You get well over 90 minutes of pure MILSAP MAGIC!
For Milsap fans, this is a MUST HAVE DVD.  For those who aren't, order this DVD and you will quickly become a fan.",1088294400,13,875,5.0
1751797,5,B00006FMBZ,"This DVD is a pure treasure.  It captures the magic found in a Live Ronnie Milsap Show.  We hear many of the number one hits, some fan favorites from albums long out of print and a few surpises that Ronnie saves just for his live performances.  Go back in time to the groups that would gather on street corners and harmonize with the doo-wop set he performs with band members.  Laugh with him as he wonders what life would be like if he had a job in a sawmill as he starts to sing fan favorite, ""The Future Isn't What It Used To Be.""  Enjoy the sounds of a full orchestra in the background as Ronnie stretches his vocal wings with four new American Standard selections.  He starts to bring the evening to a close with a tribute to some of his favorite piano men complete with visual effects of Ray Charles rocking around the bench and Jerry Lee Lewis pounding the keyboard with his foot. The grand finale is Ronnie singing ""America the Beautiful"" to a standing ovation from the audience as a huge American flag unfurls in the background.  After the excitement of the performace, settle back and listen as Ronnie gives a 30 minute in-depth interview on a variety of subjects.  This is a great addition to any music collection.",1032825600,25,1225,4.461883408071749

1751809,5,B00006FMBZ,"Unbelievably good.  I was not going to buy this, but they had an offer to buy both the CD and DVD together, and for some reason I ordered both.  I was not expecting the DVD to be very good, because normally the sound quality and even the video quality are not very good for most older music DVDs.  But I was really surprised.  First this one has Dolby Digital 5.0, Dolby Digital 2.0, and DTS 5.0 audio options.  I used the DD 5.0 option, and the sound quality was very good overall, actually excellent considering this is 2002 concert video.  It is not audiophile studio quality, but still very very good.  If you like Ronnie Milsap, you cant go wrong with this DVD.  His band is excellent throughout!  I just discovered Ronnie Milsap a few weeks ago when I bought the Cracker Barrel Ronnie Milsap ""CLASSIC COLLECTION"" CD.  I did not know he was so good until I bought these other RM CDs and DVD!!",1418601600,3,897,4.381818181818182

1751830,5,B00006FMBZ,"This definitely should have been a Platinum DVD at least (100,000+ copies). Ronnie Milsap draws crowds, young and old alike, to his performances! I highly doubt Kenny Cheesy can do that! A concert taken in January 19 (20?), 2002, this displays a lot of what Milsap typically does in his concerts: hits, medleys of hits, album tracks, and others. This is the exact same as on the CD, except there's a doo-wop section after ""Lost In The Fifties Tonight"", the standards ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"", ""But Not For Me"", and ""My Funny Valentine"" are now between ""All Is Fair In Love And War"" and ""My Babe"", ""Button Off My Shirt"" is between the last one mentioned and ""Smoky Mountain Rain"", and, disappointingly, ""A Woman In Love"" is not on here. Also, ""Happy, Happy Birthday Baby"" (happy birthday to Milsap as well!) and ""Button Off My Shirt"", both hits, are full version as well. (Wait, I don't recall about the latter, but definitely the former!) I have not yet seen the interview on here, but I will like it once I do! In the meantime, buy this to get an idea of what it'd be like to attend a Ronnie Milsap concert (which I hope on doing someday)! If you buy this without hesitation after reading, you will be pleased with what you see and hear!",1263600000,3,1253,4.475982532751091
1751831,5,B00006FMBZ,I have watched this dvd many times and love it more each time! I have seen many concert's on dvd however this one stands out! It has so many different elements that I was not expecting. Ronnie Millsap is an incredible performer and very funny.

1751833,2,B00006FMBZ,"A very disappointing DVD. Being a huge Ronnie Milsap fan, I purchased this DVD expecting to see him perform full versions of all his big hits. But alas he only sings 2 of them. ""Back in the 50's tonight"" and ""smokie Mountain Rain"" He condensed all his greatest hits into a medley the lasts only a few minutes and then spends the rest of the concert doing nostalgia and ""doo woop"" songs. Although the picture and sound quality are excellent and his voice as great as it ever was if you want a DVD of Ronnie Milsap doing all his greatest hits then the is DEFINITELY NOT THE DVD you should buy.",1202342400,2,591,4.285714285714286
1751834,5,B00006FMBZ,"The guy still has what it takes.  The band seemed a little dull and bored during the first portion of the concert, but all in all a good show.  Don't be mad at me guys!  ;-)",1169596800,2,173,3.75
1751835,5,B00006FMBZ,"Ronnie Milsap has always been a highly entertaining live performer, and a Milsap concert video had been long overdue for years. This is an excellent concert from January 2002 that showcases the great singing, piano playing, and musical diversity that makes Milsap one of America's greatest {and underrated} musical talents.

Looking young and healthy at age 59, it is clear from the opening song ""Don't you know how much I love you"" that Milsap had lost none of his musical powers. Ronnie's strong vocal attack and fine piano playing stand undiminished. What might be suprising to some who watch this is the small amount of pure country music in this show from a man who is supposed to be a country singer. Milsap is one of the most versatile singers in the business, and you will hear him tackle rock n' roll, doo wop, pop standards, and a little R&B in this concert to go along with his country hits. Ronnie is backed by a tight and professional five piece band that includes his long-time guitar player Jamie Brantley who provides fine guitar work and backing vocals throughout.

Highlights of the concert include a strong version of ""Smokey Mountain Rain"" and a performance of Ronnie's great rocker ""Stranger in my House"" with the chorus of the rock classic ""We're an American Band"" inserted in the middle of the song.  There is also some fine vocal harmony from Ronnie and the band during the lively doo-wop segment, and a medley of Milsap hits where he wails out the final note on ""What a difference you've made in my life"" to a standing ovation from the audience. I personally think ""It was Almost like a Song"" should've been taken out of the hits medley since this is truly one of Milsap's greatest songs that deserves to be presented by itself.

Milsap's soaring and heartfelt vocal performance on the beautiful Mickey Newbury composition ""The Future is not what it used to be"" is another highlight here which offers stunning proof that a 60 year old Ronnie Milsap literally blows away any male vocalist on the charts today!  This overlooked masterpiece was first recorded by Ronnie in 1977 but was never released as a single as it should've been.  It ranks among the greatest songs he ever recorded and should've been a chart-topping smash!

Ronnie shows off his smooth-as-silk crooning ability during a nice set of jazzy pop standards with a large horn section behind him, but the true highlight of this concert is saved for the end with Milsap's dynamic ""Piano Man Medley"" where he rocks out on the piano like Jerry Lee Lewis and does some great impersonations of Floyd Cramer and Ray Charles! Ronnie has been closing his concerts with this crowd-pleaser for many years and it brings down the house everytime. Unfortunately Ronnie doesn't climb on top of the piano like he used to do during this medley, but we do see him playing the piano with his foot during the rockin' version of Little Richard's ""Lucille"".

The excellent bonus interview gives us a glimpse of the warm human being behind the talent. Milsap tells a funny story about his days as a white R&B singer in the 60's and mentions the ""whole new set of rules in mainstream country music"" that prompted him to record his grammy-nominated CD ""Just for a Thrill"".  This is a must-have for anyone with an interest in Ronnie Milsap, or anyone who appreciates real musical talent. Put some ""MILSAP MAGIC"" in your collection with a copy of this DVD.",1150761600,8,3417,4.729411764705882
1751836,5,B00006FMBZ,"A must for all Ronnie Milsap fans and soon to be fans. An outstanding performance and behind the scene interview. Ronnie brings it home for all to enjoy as if you where their in the audiance, front row. All the great hits and a overwhelming version of ""The Future Is Not What It Use To Be"". Great job Ronnie.",1142812800,4,308,4.237288135593221
1751837,5,B00006FMBZ,"I found myself mesmerized by Mr. Milsap's performance on this dvd. I had seen him with Los Lonely Boys on CMT and had to see and hear more of him on stage. I was afraid it would be hard for anyone to follow up that super CMT show, but as much as I loved that, this was every bit as entertaining. Mr. Milsap's ability to sing in so many genre's is amazing. Country, bebop, rock and roll, blues, and classic ballads by Gershwin are all here and all masterfully done. It is a paradox to me that a blind man can be such a visually powerful talent. I thought the production values were very high. The sound was excellent. The selection of music great, and I found the interview with him to be both inspiring and touching. If I feel blue, I just crank up the surround system and spend some time with Ronnie and feel energized. Absolutely among the best recordings I own.",1124582400,8,864,4.274390243902439
7968064,3,B00006FMBZ,This is a good concert dvd.  To me more then anything it shows how he can do any kind of music.  And how especially good he can do 50s type music.  He has so many songs he can not possibly do them all even as a medley.  He also does standards like My Funny Valentine.  And his own songs like Smoky Mountain Rain.  I think you don't even have to be a big Ronnie Milsap fan to enjoy this.,1507593600,,386,3.8227848101265822

7968066,5,B00006FMBZ,I don't know why all of the complaints about the melodies in the show some people don't like that to me that shows Ronnie is still as talented as he has always been of course he couldn't play everything like some people wanted the guy is in his 70s and not for nothing if he were to play everything that would be like a five hour show so lay off the negative feedback as for the show superb just superb the stranger in my house remix was definitely a highlight of the show if not for nothing that part of the show is worth it altogether overall great show by I true legend highly recommend to anyone who is a Milsap fan or a country fan or someone who just wants to see a great show,1474329600,,682,4.022058823529412
