8747838,5,B00DZY2XAI,"I've been vegan for almost 3 years and this guy - among others - has really inspired me.  This DVD is PACKED with great recipes...which is great...but what takes it over the top is Jason's personality and instruction.

Simple little tips like ""rocking"" the food processor and then ALL the nutritional background on the ingredients of the recipes...while he's prepping the food...well, it's like watching an artist paint a piece of amazing art.

Laid back personality...
SUPER informative...
Great tasting recipes that are easy to follow...

ALL good for you...
ALL vegan...

Way to go Jason.  Well done man!  Thank you for making this available.",1388016000,3,645,5.085714285714285
