3142802,5,B00158K1DC,The original Flight of the Phoenix is a classic and the remake is quite good too. I my opinion remakes tend to be a let down but this one compares to the classic in every way including cast and special effects.,1372032000,,210,4.146341463414634

3142807,4,B00158K1DC,"The Flight of the Phoenix Double Feature is a really great deal! I have only seen the first one until now. The second one is super dramatic and suspenseful, with amazing graphics. The only thing is that it's a little gory. For example, when Dennis Quaid flies into the dust storm, the doors at the back of the plane swing open, causing one man to fall out. Of course, they could have left it at that, but instead, they show him splat on the ground. They also use foul language, which was not in the first movie. The first movie is better in some ways. First of all, the guy who designs the Phoenix sounds sophisticated and intelligent, unlike the one in the second movie. Also, when the designer finally tells them what he does for a living, they start to go crazy and start laughing because they think that they're going to die for sure. In the newer movie, one guy pulls out a gun and gets ready to blow him away. But all in all, this product is a great 2-for-1 deal!",1340841600,,969,4.271739130434782
3142808,5,B00158K1DC,Bought this for my son and enjoyed getting to see both eras of movie-making styles.  Solid casting and a very neat concept for those that love aviation and enjoy adventures set in unusual locations.,1314144000,,198,4.823529411764706
3142809,4,B00158K1DC,"It was not a wise move for FOX to juxtapose the 2004 FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX against Robert Aldrich's original classic from 1965. On its own the remake is an OK picture, but in comparison to its predecessor the newer version is a failure.

Seems to me the idea of a double feature is you watch two pictures in a row. Who is really gonna sit throught TWO ""Phoenix""es, TWO ""Alamo""s, TWO ""Sabrina""s or TWO ""Cape Fears"" in one afternoon? Not I, and probably not you.

Let's call this what it is: a clean widescreen transfer of a great adventure story with a sterling cast, plus some modern throwaway with a single star and mostly nobodies in support.

FIVE stars for the '65 ""Phoenix."" THREE stars for the remake. Average: FOUR stars.

8257935,5,B00158K1DC,"Movie:  original THE Flight of the Phoenix: excellent excellent 5 stars. pros: classic. DVD great virgin disc with not a single problem, with some minimal advert ran excellently n a SONY DVD w HD enhancements on old SONY 1080 TV fine sound. NO CONS.
disc 2: redo:  Flight of the Phoenix:  excellent remake and updated. pros: very well done with a few twists from original. 5 stars. supplemented first original so - having seen these before, waited a week between movies and that made it even better experience.
No cons.  glad I purchased.  (my background: professional non-entertainment; many computing devices half of which are almost always powered on simultaneously. moderate skills at computational management of these devices both mobile and desktop.)
  overall:  yes, recommend to friend; no downs.  I try not to keep collections anymore. so others will enjoy this soon.",1443139200,,876,5.156028368794326
