7856002,5,6303926770,This is a very funny movie! The premise is great and the acting is very good! I recommend this movie!,1394236800,,101,4.1
7856003,5,6303926770,"This fantastical movie is a very charming look into what would happen if early 90's Russians came in contact with their Parisian counterparts.  Not filled with typical, American situation comedy gags; this one's got soul.  One of my favorites!",1231200000,,243,5.205128205128205
7856004,5,6303926770,"This is a good comedy, that although in Russian and French, is very funny, with some surprizing twists.  If you have seen ""The Visitors"", I suppose you could say that this is a Russian movie somewhat of that genre, only without the time travel.  Particularily funny are some of the scenes that reflect differences in cultural attitudes.  I don't presently own the movie, but if it is made available on here, I would like to get a DVD of it.",1226448000,,440,4.475
7856005,5,6303926770,"The struggle between the inteligencia and the average people in a rapidly-changing society is one of many themes of this movie. If ""Moscow Doesn't Believe in Tears"" shows how life was during the years of stagnation (70s), this movie shows the life right after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nicely set in St. Petersburg in the early 90s, when the Soviet Union has just collapsed, it depicts how life really was during those first few hard years - the transition from socialism to capitalism.
When the people in a communal apartment find a window into Paris, the window becomes their opportunity to see the world. They take that opportunity.....
Unfortunately, this foreign release has an important part cut out of it, perhaps because the foreign viewer may not understand its significance, but still the movie is a MUST SEE for anyone who wants to attempt to understand the mentality of Russians or who wants to know what NOT to expect of most emigrees, because those that emigrate, are the ones who try to escape from what is shown in the movie.",1086652800,17,1049,4.769230769230769
7856006,4,6303926770,"This is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen!  The plot is magical, yet not in a corny or fairy-tale type way.  Taking place in the '60s, It's hilarious to see what a Russian man and his friends do when- you guessed it- they find a window that leads to Paris.  Also funny when the poor french woman goes into russia through the window, chasing the people who are causing havoc, and she is trapped there.  Great story, Great movie!",1050364800,5,440,4.265060240963855
7856007,5,6303926770,"I saw this movie twice and then a week later I rented it again
and saw it twice again. The acting is good everybody does a good
job in the smallest role. Reminded me of ""Bringing Up Baby"".
This movie is better. I didn't know russians made such funny mov-
ies. I am going to rent more russian comedies.",1049587200,2,301,4.11864406779661
