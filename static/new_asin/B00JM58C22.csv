6381597,5,B00JM58C22,Fabulous collection!,1405641600,,20,9.5
6381598,5,B00JM58C22,"This is an AMAZING set!! I LOVE the first movie and this series is great to add to my collection. I will admit that the animation isn't as good as the movies. But I didn't expect it to be either, it is, after all a TV series and they can't put as much time into it as they do the movies. (That's how I think of it anyways. :) ) The series is true to the characters and I loved watching how the story unfolds after dragons become a part of their lives.",1405641600,2,451,3.860215053763441

6381603,4,B00JM58C22,"Received this item yesterday. It's exactly what you would expect, all 4 Dragons collections. They are stacked on top of each other. You'll find first that the collection is shrinkwrapped together. Makes sense. Once I removed that, I noticed two pieces of tape held them all together. Now keep in mind the shipment I got only had the slipcover for the final part. Once I removed the tape, it took all the print from the slipcover with it, thereby ruining it. If you are one that cares about keeping slipcovers looking nice, good luck with the poor decision by Amazon. However I would assume slipcovers are first come first serve and I cannot guarantee you'll get any at all.

Other than that blunder, this collection delivers at the amazing price this week. Kids may enjoy this more than adults. There were 3 poop jokes in the first episode alone.",1403136000,4,846,4.677852348993288

8652409,2,B00JM58C22,"This is getting worse the longer i own it. On Arrival one of the cases was broke on the inside and one was missing its sleeve, don't know if that was a mistake or if one didn't have a sleeve. They worked fine the first time a played each DVD but the second time i put them in after i hit play all it freezes, then i have to eject the disc to get it to work, after that it plays as normal. The episodes themselves are good.",1527811200,,422,3.8068181818181817
