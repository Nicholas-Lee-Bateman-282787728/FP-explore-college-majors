8304864,5,B00007G1WE,I bought this for my husband and we were both swept away by the music and the on-screen kisses.  It was very romantic and made the both of us Andrea Bocelli fans.  This was just amazing!!,1062979200,6,187,4.166666666666667

8304866,5,B00007G1WE,"Some of the best kisses of the silver screen play as Andea Bocelli sings Con Te Partiro - (For those not familiar with this song you'll recognize it immediately upon hearing it - especially if you ever watched the Sopranos.) This little disc sure puts you in the mood! I can't wait to play it on Valentines evening, candles, champaign, chocolate and Bocelli, ought to do the trick....
After you've seen it a couple of times you'll notice how well the cuts are timed to the music, and how the clips build in intensity as the song crescendos.  Very nicely done.  It leads one to think of other great screen kisses, that didn't make the cut - or couldn't be licensed.  It's a nice discussion topic for a Valentines night!",1044662400,10,718,4.507692307692308
8304867,5,B00007G1WE,"I gave this creative mini dvd to my girlfriend and all I can say is that I scored major points.  While I'm not known to be the most sentimental person, this little gift showed that maybe there is a sensitive side to me.  To all guys, BUY THIS DVD for your significant other!!!!!!  It's both cheap and sends the message loud and clear that you care.  I can't say enough about this new and innovative technology.  BUY IT!!!",1043366400,5,421,4.346153846153846
