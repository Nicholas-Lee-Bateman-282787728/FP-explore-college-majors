8621835,5,B00GB0OUZY,"This series is very interesting, and my comments apply to each of the DVDs from this source
If these discs don't dispel the idea of ""the hard-bitten old pros in the symphony orchestra who turn up to play worn out pieces time after time"", then nothing will.  Each of the players in this ""scratch orchestra"" are at the top of the profession, and I have not seen anything other than genuine enthusiasm on the faces throughout these performances.  Perhaps it could be argued that (using a sporting analogy) that a ""team of champions"" may not always equate to ""a champion team"", but given that these superstars of the profession only meet over a weekend and rehearse and record, there are glimpses of what they COULD achieve if playing together full time.  I imagine that the players, each of whom play in outstanding groups on a daily basis, enjoy the subtle differences produced by the other players in this orchestra.  And it is these sounds and nuances which provide each player some novelty, where a range of ""long familiar sounds"" is played in a different manner than at their own group.
Each of these episodes features a ""warhorse"" and at least one piece of music that is more recently composed.  Whilst one could argue that there are better integrated performances (from full time groups), but these performances are interesting, polished and show some outstanding solo work from all sections of the orchestra.
There is clearly a good deal of respect all round for Gerard Schwarz, and he for them.  The interviews are all interesting in their own right, and most players express the feeling of honour at being part of the group.
These programmes are well worth the money, and I look forward to future editions from this orchestra and conductor.",1512864000,,1747,4.806666666666667
8621836,5,B00GB0OUZY,"It is superb...great music, great players...and a first class director to pull the band together. (And to think...that Gerard Schwartz was once only a first class trumpet player!)  I think I will get the rest of this series.

8621838,5,B00GB0OUZY,"A very well done recording of two major-league symphonies. Very well played and conducted by the All Star Orchestra and Maestro Schwarz. Superb camera work and editing throughout. If possible, play this DVD at ""Full Room Volume"" for the experience of attending the actual concert in New York's Manhattan Centre.",1392076800,,311,5.24

8621840,5,B00GB0OUZY,"Based on the title and other limited data I suggest you review this listing and likely remove it.  As far as we know there will not be more discs for a bit.  Seasons 2 and 3 are only in the planning stage.  Contact Maestro Schwarz's manager my source of information for any up date.
