8395825,1,B003F296SW,"This is about the worst DVD for exercise I have ever had the misfortune to buy.  This is more of a promotional DVD for an assortment of equipment that the demonstrators use than for helping an older person regain or keep their physical strength and mobility.  They rapidly show the watcher how to use whatever piece of equipment for a muscle group and then move on to the next-just a demo-no, now you do it too, i.e. Kathy Smith or Gin Miller,et al.  Did I mention that the 1st 1/2 of the DVD is all a bunch of elderly telling you to lose weight and get fit for health, as they walk through Big Sky, MT?  After the very brief equipment demo, he goes on to eat right etc,etc, etc. Showing ""healthy "" foods.  What a waste of time and money..  And I am well over 60 and DO workout with Gin Miller and Kathy Smith,etc daily.  I was looking for new faces and a little variety-NOT a lecture on joining a gym (I live very rural!) and eating right, things I already know and do. This is not a fitness DVD at all. Just a very long and boring lecture on eating right, doing resistance training as you get older and keep your weight down.",1363219200,,1127,4.189814814814815
8395826,5,B003F296SW,"My mom recently lost 25 pounds at the age of 55. She is in the best shape of her life, and owes most of it to John Humble's Forever Young video. I bought this DVD not expecting any different then other workout DVD's, but hoping with the target age being hers maybe she'd get something out of it. It exceeded my expectations, and she swears that she'll be following the workout for the rest of her life.
Highly Recommend!",1276473600,,420,4.329113924050633
8395827,5,B003F296SW,"John Humble's dvd has it all.  In this beautifully filmed video shot in the moutains of Montana, John describes in detail how strength training will improve our lives and allow us to continue to participate in the activities we have enjoyed, how to improve our well being, and how to make certain that we will be around to enjoy our children and grandchildren and be the role models we were surely meant to be.  Something about John speaks to our hearts and the yearning we have to continue to be attractive and strong, and his fitness program shows us how to accomplish this.  One of the great things about the dvd is that there is a card included that you can take to the gym with you that outlines which exercises to perform and how to perform them.  No question, this dvd will get you moving and definitely help you to improve your life.  It did mine.",1273968000,,855,4.420382165605096
8395828,5,B003F296SW,"After watching the videos on the website I immediately knew I wanted to buy this DVD for my parents. Regular exercise and good nutrition for anyone can feel daunting. John's approach makes the idea of getting in shape and eating right feel very achievable, not difficult. My parents LOVE it and the workout card that comes with it helps them remember the routine once they are at the gym. Very inspiring...",1273795200,2,406,4.732394366197183
8395829,5,B003F296SW,"This Humble guy is unreal! He sais it like it is and obviously knows what he is indeed saying. It' about time someone starting looking out for the boomers and seniors on this planet. Take my advice and have a look at this spectacular dvd, it will be the best investment you will ever make. I like him saying it isn't about being lean and mean, but fitter and healthier and happier. Is it possible he has the secret to help all of us aging bodies out? I think so big time. Thanks John.",1273622400,2,484,4.159574468085107
8395830,5,B003F296SW,"John Humble's Forever Young video has helped my whole family. I heard about it from a friend and immediately thought about giving it to my 75-year-old dad for his birthday. My dad is still really active--skiing, hiking, etc.--but over the past few years he has started looking and acting older. We've always told him that he needs to start doing some weight training to keep him strong and healthy, but he just never would. But after John Humble and the doctors explain it in the video, my dad is finally sold. He's been doing the regular weight training workouts for over a month and he feels and looks great. It was also a good reminder to me and my brother that we should start weight training NOW. We are heading into middle age and want to look and feel good too.",1273622400,3,768,4.453900709219858
8395831,5,B003F296SW,"Although I am not the target age for Humble's video, I am so glad that I took the time to watch it anyway. Watching Forever Young video in my late 30's, made me realize I need to be doing more NOW to take care of my body and set myself up for success as I get older, especially as a woman living in Montana with an outdoor lifestyle. Most people in that video are much older than me and in WAY better shape... that was a wake up call! Having recently been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, a lot of the exercises (low impact) actually made sense for me to be incorporating into my workouts now.  I appreciated that the video was more than just a warm-up, workout and cool down. By knowing more about the philosophy behind the workout and fitness suggestions, it just added more meaning to all the information and training tips provided. The idea of resistance training is far from a new concept for me, but the exercises in the video and the descriptions for why they are so critical, was a very motivating combination.",1273363200,2,1022,4.4361702127659575
8395832,5,B003F296SW,"John Humble is truly passionate about wanting to help add years to your life.  He cares.  He's as real as it gets, and his years of experience have led to a recipe for ""Forever Young"" that is not a gimmick.  His beliefs and fitness opinions have been substantiated by the Harvard Medical Journal. Most importantly John's approach is fun, attainable, realistic, and inspirational.  John's DVD gives you the balance of lifestyle, resistance training, fitness tips, cardio, nutrition, medical advice and of course...  the secret formula.

I've been giving John's DVD to my friends (and their parents), and every single one of them say the same thing: Thank you.  But we have John to thank for wanting to make a difference.",1273363200,,719,4.941666666666666
