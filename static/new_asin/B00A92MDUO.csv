8548664,5,B00A92MDUO,My 2 preschoolers can't get enough of this DVD.  They picked up the songs and dance moves right away and even some of the signing.  I was thrilled when they were able to identify the words from the DVD written on a sheet of paper!  Does anyone know when Volume 2 will be released?,1355097600,,280,4.148148148148148
