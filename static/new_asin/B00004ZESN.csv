7928603,5,B00004ZESN,"The DVD titled ""My Romance - An Evening with Jim Brickman in Concert"" is an excellent blend of vocal and instrumental pieces....outstanding performances by Donny Osmond and Olivia Newton-John.",1235088000,,192,5.655172413793103
7928604,3,B00004ZESN,"I specifically bought this DVD because Donny Osmond and Olivia Newton John are on it.  (I am a huge fan of both Donny and Olivia.)  Jim Brickman is also very talented but I don't know enough about him to make a fair judgement.  I did watch the whole DVD and I enjoyed it though.  I would say that if you enjoy Jim Brickman and piano music, which I do like, you will enjoy this DVD.",1214352000,,381,4.04
7928605,5,B00004ZESN,I liked the CD and I like the DVD even more.  It's a great concert and I really liked his guest performers.,1213833600,,107,3.8636363636363638
7928606,4,B00004ZESN,"I saw Jim Brickman as an opening act for Olivia Newton-John in Connecticut about three years ago.  His act was all right, but it was also very boring.  Imagine my surprise when I saw his concert on DVD - a concert in which he was the headliner.

I bought the DVD simply because of the guest stars, one of which is Olivia Newton-John.  They had collaborated on a couple of songs and they present them here.  One of the songs, ""My Valentine,"" was released as a single - although I never heard it on the radio.

If you like the sort of thing that Brickman sells, then you will love this DVD.  He's actually excellent at what he does.  It's not my cup of tea, though.  To me, his act is something I could probably find in a thousand piano bars.

Because of the pacing of the concert, I am deducting one star.

Otherwise, it's quite enjoyable (if you like this sort of thing).",1129939200,3,871,4.25
7928607,5,B00004ZESN,"Jim Brickman is a very talented performer, song writer, and vocalist.  This concert was a pleasure to watch and one to watch again, and again, and again.

I loved too the performances by Donny Osmond.  To me, that was two great artists coming together to make sweet music.

Olivia Newton-John was also a guest artist on this concert and it is great to hear her voice again and as beautiful as ever.

I loved the behind the scenes.  They were hilarious and fun to watch.

This is a definite 5 and more stars DVD and a must watch, must have DVD to add to your collection.",1104624000,18,569,4.311320754716981
