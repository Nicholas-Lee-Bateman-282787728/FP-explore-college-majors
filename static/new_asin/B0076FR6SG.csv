8510915,5,B0076FR6SG,"This was one of the films I saw at The Brooklyn Film Festival. Hillarious romantic movie without the 'chick flick' element...my husband laughed harder than me at times. Whilst the delivery is nothing less than witty, the movie is thought provoking on many levels. I don't want to give too many secrets away but in addition to the humour and over arching message, the moments of animation and scenes of Brooklyn make this movie a must watch. 2 thumbs up.",1339027200,3,453,4.675
8510916,5,B0076FR6SG,"I caught this during one of the NY FF and loved the character driven plot. The main characters were perfect for the role and the animation was top notch. If you are looking for a light hearted movie, this is it. PS - watch out for Salvatore as the bad guy...he gets the most laugh in the movie.",1338508800,4,294,4.086206896551724
8510917,5,B0076FR6SG,"Saw this romantic comedy at one of the New York Film Festivals that it played at.  Really a great, very funny movie.  The characters are well thought out and well-acted and I thought a very realistic portrayal of mid-twenties angst when it comes to romance and career.  The use of animation in the film was quite unique and added well to the film.  Definitely worth watching.",1337299200,4,375,4.636363636363637
