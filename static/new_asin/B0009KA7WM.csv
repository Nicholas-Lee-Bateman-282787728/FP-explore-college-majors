8114739,5,B0009KA7WM,"First, this video is appropriately deemed ""intermediate level"" on Yogi Marlon's website. If you are a newcomer to yoga, I recommend her ""Yoga for Absolute Beginners"" video.

The video definitely focuses more on yoga as a spiritual practice or device, with segments on chanting, incorporating ""om"" into your meditation practice, & a segment on bhakti (devotional) yoga with US kirtan recording artist, Krishna Das. For me, I don't think I would have been ready for these particular components when I first began doing yoga. Chanting & ""om-ing"" are more advanced meditation practices, and the silent meditations on ""Absolute Beginners"" are probably more appropriate for newer yoga enthusiasts.

If you're looking for several different yoga ""workouts"" -- you'll be disappointed, because that's not what this collection is. There are really only 2 actual segments of hatha yoga practice on the DVD. I felt that the two practices, which included revolved poses like revolved triangle pose were more challenging than ""Yoga for Absolute Beginners.""",1207094400,5,1041,5.419753086419753
