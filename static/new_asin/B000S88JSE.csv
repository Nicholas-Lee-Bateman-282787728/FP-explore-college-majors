8204694,3,B000S88JSE,"""Extreme Challenge"" qualifies as one of the most generic, take-it-or-leave-it Hong Kong martial arts features ever produced. It's a movie made for viewers who want hand-to-hand action and not much else. Forget the plot and acting, almost entirely, and consider this one no further unless you live for kung fu.

The story: a nationwide martial arts tournament is sponsored by a manipulative online corporation looking for a new representative. Among the participants is a young woman determined to prove her skill (Pink Power Ranger Patricia Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbo/dp/B004RP795S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbo</a>&nbsp;thru&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Galaxy/dp/6305499152/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Galaxy</a>), a returning champion poised to choose between pride and family (Paul Rapovski,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Dragon/dp/B000TGUUCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Dragon</a>), and an aspiring competitor with an unbreakable sense of honor (Ken Chang,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Zone/dp/B000GFLKDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Zone</a>).

The tagline of the updated DVD release states ""Thousands will fight. ONE will survive"" - this is extremely misleading, since the list of actual competitors is sixteen (of these, only eight are focused on) and the tournament doesn't include any fatalities. This eliminates any sense of importance to the fights: the corporation's incentive isn't anything to care about, and without a life & death situation to raise the stakes, the fights are really just happening for their own sake. Luckily, they're pretty good if you can accept that each one feels a lot like those before it. Six one-on-one encounters and two melee battles on raised platforms showcase pretty good choreography by Jack Wong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bulletproof-Monk/dp/B0000A9GHD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bulletproof Monk</a>), inclusive of some sweet weapon-handling. Patricia Lee and Scott Adkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>) in particular provide excellent demonstrations of the tonfa and nunchaku, respectively. There's some excessive cutting to each of the encounters, but it's just cutting for the sake of style: it doesn't look like they're trying to hide stunt doubles or something.

The rest of the movie concerns itself with the different relationships among the combatants and the conniving antics of the organizer, Jacquiline Li. Half of the film is a platform for her to spout off corporate philosophy (it's pretty effective: she gets *former* role model Patricia Lee to admit ""We're all tools""), which was particularly irritating for me because she actually reminds me a lot of my boss. (SPOILER) This makes it particularly disappointing that she doesn't get her comeuppance in the end, physically or financially, but oh well. This doesn't make or break the film.

Apparently, the movie was filmed in English, but I can't help but suspect that a lot of the characters' performances have been dubbed. This adds to my impression that nobody in the cast could even act very well to begin with, making the non-fighting portions of the film even less worth watching. A bit of screenplay silliness helps keep things interesting (e.g. the opening press conference, featuring some absolutely insane competitors destroying their podiums), but I have to admit that I found myself going to sleep, after a while, inbetween the punching and kicking. Were there more of these fisticuffs, the movie may have gotten a higher rating, but I can't be sure: from the story to the slugging, chances are that you've seen all of this before and done better, so ""Extreme Challenge"" can only endear itself so much.",1309996800,,4063,6.490774907749078
