8060253,5,B0009GF11I,"I want it in DVD format too.  My husband is a teacher and they are reading the book and he'd like to show it to his kids when they are finished it.  I remember seeing this movie as a child and it has stuck with me into my mid 50s.  It is a good, clean, family classic and should really be converted to DVD.  I came on Amazon looking for a copy to buy him for Christmas but alas, no luck.  $30 is a bit steep to lay down for old technology!!",1290556800,5,440,3.739130434782609
8060254,5,B0009GF11I,"I have seen this movie many years ago. I would gladly buy it in a heartbeat if it were available (as a dvd). As another reviewer commented VHS is such ancient technology (kind of like 8-track tapes) Will anyway the storyline starts in Norway when the Nazis try to acquire as much gold as they can to finance the Hitler regime. The boys find a way to sneak the gold out of Norway to the USA in the winter. To find out their method, you will just have to watch the movie, when it gets into DVD format. Well anyway, I'll be looking forward to the transition of this movie into DVD.",1273795200,4,578,4.169642857142857
8060255,5,B0009GF11I,"Why can't this movie be released on DVD......VHS is ancient technology and I can't buy a VCR anymore.....

HELP.....This movie was enjoyed by my whole family.  To me it's still a classic.

There are oodles of stupid movies full of sex, violence, etc that are released.....This is family entertainment.

Let me know who to talk with to get this released.
