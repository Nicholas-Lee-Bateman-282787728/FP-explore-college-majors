8568764,5,B00BHY1PL6,"Have watched two of the selections thus far and they were most enjoyable as well as being of importance to cinema at the time of their release.  A third, Four Just men, is a favorite Edgar Wallace based film that I had a poor copy of. The boxed set arrived in excellent condition - well packaged and with a timely arrival considering that it came from overseas.  Many thanks.",1412121600,,375,4.420289855072464
