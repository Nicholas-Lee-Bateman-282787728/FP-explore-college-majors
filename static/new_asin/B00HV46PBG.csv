8636257,5,B00HV46PBG,"The two best Ripley movies. If you are a fan of Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley character, these two movies are likely the best film adaptations of her Ripley books. By ""best,"" I mean that these are the closest in spirit to Highsmith's books and central character. despite the plot changes made for the films. For example, these movies, taken together, highlight Tom Ripley's evolution from shy, insecure, and slightly unwilling sociopath/killer to full-fledged, brutally effective, urbane, and comfortable-in-his-skin sociopath/killer. Both movies are excellent, though the first (Talented Mr. Ripley) is perhaps more approachable, a highly watchable and beautifully crafted masterpiece by director Anthony Minghella. The second (Ripley's Game) is, as another reviewer notes, bizarre. Still, even more so than Talented Mr. Ripley, Ripley's Game captures the weirdness of Tom Ripley--his equally attractive and repugnant aspects. Directed by Liliana Cavani, Ripley's Game is as watchable as Talented Mr. Ripley and as beautifully filmed. I cannot wholeheartedly recommend these movies to those unfamiliar with Patricia Highsmith's creepy view of the world, but for Highsmith fans, these movies are essential if you want to see Highsmith's famous character on film. Naturally, the books are essential, too.

For those not familiar with Highsmith's Ripley character, I can say that both movies are lush and filled with intrigue. Acting is top-notch, sets are ""to die for"" (pun intended), and you can tell that the director, actors, scriptwriters, cinematographers, set designers, costume designers, and just about anyone else connected to the movies knew what they were doing and wanted to create the best films possible.

The Talented Mr. Ripley has a faster pace and more classic thriller-mystery plot. Matt Damon's Tom Ripley is endlessly sympathetic, despite his actions  Ripley's Game is slower but interesting if you give it a little time. John Malkovich's Ripley is as creepy as Damon's Ripley is sympathetic, though both characterizations are in keeping with the character created by Highsmith. However, I think Ripley's Game may be confusing to those who have not read or watched The Talented Mr. Ripley. For that reason, I find it a brilliant idea to put both of these movies together on one DVD. Talented Mr. Ripley can definitely be viewed on  its own, but both movies (especially Ripley's Game) benefit from being viewed as a set. Like many good stories, The Talented Mr. Ripley leaves viewers and readers wanting to follow Tom Ripley into the future, to find out what happens to him after the first movie or book ends. For better or worse, Ripley's Game answers that question.",1476489600,2,2688,5.347517730496454
