They involve a good deal of high speed highway racing on the Shuto Expressway in Tokyo...weaving in and out of traffic, as well as closed circuit racing with Keiichi Tsuchiya and some drifting.  Most of the movie plots seem very similar...kind of reminded me somewhat of Wangan Midnight, only with really bad hair.  Anyone who appreciates Japanese cars will enjoy them.  Worth the $24 I spent for all 6 movies.",1282867200,2,514,4.806818181818182
8154237,5,B000K4X5UI,"Awesome set. Has plenty of racing scenes, while trying to convey the message : keep it off of the street, and on the tracks.  Also has special appearance by the drift king himself.",1242432000,,180,4.454545454545454
