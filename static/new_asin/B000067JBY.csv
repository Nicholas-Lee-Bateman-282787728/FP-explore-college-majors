7963413,1,B000067JBY,"<strong>Cleopatra's Second Husband</strong> (Jon Reiss, 1998)

When it comes to bad movies, there are circles. There is the bad film. (And to continue the Dante allegory, Purgatory is the place where one finds those so-bad-they're-great films of which we all have a nostalgic library in our heads.) There is the awful film. There is the terrible film. Etc., etc. ad nauseam, all the way down to the ninth circle. In my own personal film mythography, the ninth circle of celluloid hell can only ever be occupied by one movie. That movie holds the title of The Worst Movie Ever Made That Does Not Star Hugh Grant. (The qualifier is there because <em>About a Boy</em> is, and will most likely always be, the worst, most offensive film ever made.) Since I came up with this analogy, a single film has held the title: <em>Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie</em>, a film you have almost certainly not seen made by a bunch of amateurs who were most likely very drunk the entire time. It is the kind of thing that will make you want to tear your eyes out of your head and re-insert them incorrectly so you never have to be exposed to the horror that is <em>Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie</em> again. Where <em>About a Boy</em> is the worst movie ever made because it is offenseive to the very core, <em>ZAMN:TM</em> is the second-worst movie ever made because it is so completely inept an attempt at making a movie.

Or at least, it was, in my universe, the second-worst movie ever made until last night, when I first encountered the bottoless pit of despair that is <em>Cleopatra's Second Husband</em>.

My problem is that I am a Radha Mitchell fan. Well, okay, ""fan"" may be a bit of an understatement. I am a certified Radha Mitchell <em>fiend</em>, the kind of person who will go to whatever lengths necessary to hunt down every frame of celluloid on which the woman has appeared. (Though in my defense, while I have a copy of the movie she made with Woody Allen sitting on my entertainment center, I haven't been able to bring myself to watch it yet--my Radha Mitchell fetish has its limits, and those limits are defined by Woody Allen, it would seem.) This is not solely because when Ms. Mitchell steps outside, the sun puts on SPF30, though that is certainly a part of it. It's also because Mitchell's films have, in the main, presented me with great entertainment over the years, from the cheesy space opera of <em>Pitch Black</em> to the one-person suspense of <em>Visitors</em> to the luscious romance of <em>High Art</em>. I mean, come on, she almost managed to make <em>Phone Booth</em> worth watching.

This, on the other hand, was unsave-able. In addition to Mitchell, you could have put Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, or Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, or Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, or pick your favorite acting twosome, in the lead roles here and this movie still would have caused you to start hitting yourself over the head with the nearest mallet within half an hour.

Billed as an ""erotic thriller"" (it manages neither), <em>Cleopatra's Second Husband</em> gives us, at least at the beginning, the story of Robert (<em>Bad Lieutenant</em>'s Paul Hipp) and Hallie (<em>Monk</em>'s Bitty Schram) Marrs, a yuppie couple who get the chance to take a week's vacation out in the middle of nowhere. They hire Zack (<em>Hannibal</em>'s Boyd Kestner) and Sophie (Mitchell) to house-sit for them while they're out. All well and good until they get back and are sweet-talked into letting the pair stay an extra week while they close a deal on another place to live. You know where this is going, but what you don't know is that it gets there in the most tedious of ways--and once it gets where it's going, there's another hour of movie to go.

I'm not going to guarantee it, but there's a possibility this movie might have benefitted from an extensive script rewrite--to something that made some semblance of sense, was better-paced, and knew where it was going and how to get there. Better acting in some key roles would have helped, though given the calibre of actor to be found here, the problem there must be placed at the feet of the director (a quick check of IMDB shows that this is Reiss' only feature-length film that is not a documentary). A cinematographer whose sole method of expression isn't ""murky"" would have improved matters a bit. But honestly, I'm not sure craking all those things to ten would have improved this mess. It is an awful, awful movie, and if you never get the chance to see it, you will be doing yourself a great service. (zero)",1347235200,,4566,4.7298994974874375

7963415,5,B000067JBY,"Honestly, I don't think I would have ever watched this film had I not known the writer/director, Jon Reiss (we went to Junior High and High School together if anyone cares).  But I was pleasantly surprised!  The story line is easy to follow and the scenes are just long enough to peak your interest.  I found it to be quietly sinister, it sneaks up on you and won't let you off the sofa (futon in my case).  The camera angles and the use of color and props make it very appealing.  I won't spoil the movie for you, you have to see it to appreciate it.  It is 90 minutes and nothing is wasted in this film.  I would love to see what Jon does next, check out his other films on Amazon!",1251244800,,683,4.090225563909774
7963416,3,B000067JBY,"The first half of this film actually works well because the dynamics of the two couples portrayed are sizzling, punchy, and smart.  One of them is a yuppie duo made up of a photographer obsessed with somewhat creepy subjects, and his wife who's equally compulsive in her behavior about trying to become pregnant.  These two obvious uptighters are paired off against a couple who are the obvious opposite--wild with enormous libidos, selfish, and inconsiderate.
It's when the film progresses to the dynamics of the two men alone that it encounters serious problems. The interaction here is much too forced, contrived; there's a lot of treading water here, but the water is pseudo-water and the treading is thrashing about without a reason.  After all, why thrash around in water that's not even water?  Without giving away the plot points here, it's just not credible that the dominant one of this male pair would continue to accept the ministrations of the other man after a major problem arises.  In addition, the dominant guy's treatment of the other man is much too crudely handled.
This obvious lack of credibility ruins the entire second half of the film whose ending would otherwise be very creepy.  But because the events leading up to it really don't work, the ending suffers considerably.  We just don't buy it.
Had the filmmaker thought through the interaction of the two men more carefully and plotted the film in this middle section more believably, this would have been a significantly stronger piece of work. As it is, it is a muddle whose three stars are for the strong first half and some definite creepiness in the ending section.  In addition, any title that requires serious cogitation to understand (after which it is STILL not understood) is perhaps somewhat suspect.",1074384000,2,1788,4.956521739130435
7963417,4,B000067JBY,"Full disclosure: I rented this film because a former boyfriend of mine was the director of photography and I was curious to see what he'd been up to.  For a low-budget film, it is gorgeously filmed (good job, Matt Faw!) and well acted.  Given the title and the word ""erotic"" on the cover, I was expecting the plot to evolve into a kinky threesome, but instead its twistedness takes a whole different route.  It starts out normally enough: a couple who's stressed out from trying to get pregnant takes a vacation and allows another couple they don't really know to house-sit.  When they get back, the house-sitters won't leave.  The mind-games quickly escalate and eventually turn violent and unexpectedly (but very inventively) sadistic.  Not a date movie, but definitely worth watching if you like odd, twisted, offbeat films.  (And the director's commentary only added to my appreciation of the cast and crew's achievement.)",1060473600,5,926,5.0130718954248366
7963418,2,B000067JBY,"I'm not going to tell you how the movie ended like the previous poster had, thank you very much. If you like diabolical movies, then add this to your list of ones to watch. It's predictable in a many ways with a sick surprising ending. I wasn't enjoying it much and not too enthuses about this cuz it's not my type of movie and i would not watch it again due to the nature of the subject matter which is twisted. My question is 'who is the 2nd husband of cleopatra?' which is what i was trying to figure out during the whole movie.",1039219200,,531,4.115384615384615
7963419,4,B000067JBY,"This is a fascinating look at the dark turns unhealthy relationships can take. This low budget film, written and directed by Jon Reiss, starts off innocuously enough. Robert (Paul Hipp) and Halle (Bitty Schram) are a rather boring,yuppyish LA couple. Halle is domineering in a whiny sort of way; her husband is submissive in a detached sort of way. This fact does not seem very interesting at the outset, but it sets the stage for the rest of the film's bizarre developments. Paul and Halle go on vacation and entrust their house to the care of another couple, Zach (Boyd Kestner) and Sophie (Radha Mitchell). Those of us who have seen any psychological thrillers know that this is a fatal mistake, but Paul and Halle are preoccupied with their own issues. Theirs is a passionless marriage; Halle regulates their sex life based on her ovulation cycles. Paul, meanwhile, is trying to jumpstart a fledgling career as a photographer. He is also a hypochondriac who constantly downs herbal remedies. When they return, the house is a mess and Paul's tropical fish are dead. Zach and Sophie declare they have no place to go, and convince the other couple to let them stay another week. From here, things turn at first predictably, then unpredictably dark and strange. Sophie seduces Paul; Halle leaves. Zach gradually reveals himself to be a sadistic psychopath who easily dominates the physically and emotionally weaker Paul. The rest of the film is all about violence, sado-masochism and revenge. Jon Reiss does a very good job of allowing his film to sneak up on us. It doesn't exactly build suspense in the manner of Hollywood film; the pace is slow and the mood changes subtly rather than abrubtly. Those looking for a conventional suspense-thriller may become bored early on, as it starts off rather sluggishly. Like many low budget independent films, the cast is small and the atmosphere somewhat claustrophobic. Yet Cleopatra's Second Husband (a cryptic, misleading title) makes the most of it's limited scope, actually turning it into an essential feature of the plot. There is no simplistic resolution to things; this is neither a morality tale, a gore-fest nor a gimmicky thriller, but a complex exploration into the deepest realms of the human psyche.",1028160000,8,2257,4.989389920424403
7963420,4,B000067JBY,"I originally saw this movie during a film festival in New York and the audience reaction was fairly positive. This movie is an interesting treatise on societal male emasculation (at least in my opinion)with some unexpected and harrowing plot turns, especially at the end. The cast is quite good (although the actress'portrayal of main character's wife may get on your nerves)and pretty much unknown.
If you like a movie that's off the beaten path (and I do mean way off the beaten path), this movie won't disappoint you.",1026086400,3,520,4.920454545454546
