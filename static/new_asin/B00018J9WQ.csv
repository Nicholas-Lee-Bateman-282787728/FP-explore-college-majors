1976990,5,B00018J9WQ,"My family loved Pastor Greg. This is what all shows should be like. Pastor Greg was funny with a good story without sex, violence and dark humor. Pastor Greg and everyone else seemed very real. I think all families will love Pastor Greg.",1077753600,,237,4.534883720930233
1976991,5,B00018J9WQ,Great comedy with a message. Pastor Greg wasn't a Hollywood created Pastor he kept it real and that was refreshing. Every Pastor goes through what Pastor Greg did and I enjoyed him. The story was great and the people that run the church are just like my church. Is Greg and Lori going to get together? We hope so.,1077753600,3,313,4.322033898305085
1976992,5,B00018J9WQ,"This is great comedy without the normal sex, violence and degrading comments. Pastor Greg came off as a very real and lovable person instead of being a perfect Pastor. He showed us his insecurity which everyone of us deal with. The supporting characters where lovable also and the story was fun. I highly recomend Pastor Greg to everyone, if you want to have fun without the evil stuff. I want more!",1077753600,,399,4.633802816901408

8007898,5,B00018J9WQ,"For a low budget program, this is well written and really makes a person feel good about being involved in the church process.",1501977600,,126,4.521739130434782

8007900,1,B00018J9WQ,Could not possibly be any lamer. If I could deny it a single star I would. Really really unfunny,1440028800,,96,4.105263157894737
8007901,5,B00018J9WQ,I was so excited to see this.  I used to watch this show years ago and thought it was just so funny.  Loved that this is the first episode...would love to find more.  Received this as told I would and in excellent shape.  Thank you,1356739200,,231,4.066666666666666
8007902,5,B00018J9WQ,I love watching Pastor GReg. It is one of my favorite programs. It is so good to watch a sitcom that is clean and funny and at the same time it always has also a deep message with it. I can recomment it toeveryone who needs to let go and just laugh.,1195430400,,249,3.8076923076923075
8007903,1,B00018J9WQ,"This show points out exactly why the church in the U.S. is no longer relevant.  Horrible acting, the worst jokes I've ever heard, and production value that could be done with a home video recorder.  I can't believe there are so many positive reviews for this piece of garbage.  I'm a college pastor and I'm considering showing this DVD to our college group to talk about why the church is not reaching the culture for Christ.

People think Christians don't understand what is funny, and this show proves them right!  You don't have to use crude humor or put downs to be funny... but this is not funny!  Christian TV is awful and everyone who commented on this previously should really spend some time with some non-Christians outside the church so they can stop being so lame and actually understand why the church is declining in this country so rapidly.  Pastor Greg is honestly the worst show I have ever seen.",1158192000,2,913,4.633540372670807
8007904,5,B00018J9WQ,"This show crystallizes the moral values I have struggled to vocalize.  I thank the Lord that I can come home after a long, frustrating day of work, and sit down to my ""Pastor Greg"" DVD, accompanied by a can of chef boyardee and diet coke.

One complaint I have about the show is the avoidance of interracial relations.  I feel that pastor Greg and the black chick (I think her name was Laquifa?) should stop denying their feelings for each other and join in the unity of love.  I think this would make the church more relatable and broaden the horizons.

Also, ""Pastor Greg"" has helped me to overcome my former Judaism and homosexuality.  I am now single, a little lonely, but Christian and couldn't be happier.  Thank you Jesus.",1141344000,4,729,4.561538461538461
8007905,5,B00018J9WQ,"This movie is awesome and funny.  With a great message.  Very well written Greg Robbins totally nails his character.  Delightfully funny and recommended for the whole family.  Also checkout the ""Behind the scenes Making of Pastor Greg"" Produced by Bill Munsell.  A behind the scenes look at how Pastor Greg was created.",1080777600,3,319,5.0576923076923075
8007906,5,B00018J9WQ,"We've aired this program on our network. It was well received.
This is a great stand-alone comedy suitable for the whole family. It also is a pilot for an on-going sitcom which Greg hopes to produce. We welcome the effort and look forward to additional episodes. We all want to know what's the chemistry between Greg and Lori. Will the ""Dude"" get together with the ""Dudette?""
As a seminary grad, I appreciate the wholesome and fresh way Greg portrays a young minister. We are not all stuffed shirts, but real people with problems too.
Good luck Greg.",1077840000,3,550,4.680412371134021
