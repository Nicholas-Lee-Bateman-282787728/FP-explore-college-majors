7579744,3,B019PRS6EA,"Three boys escape on their bikes on the backdrop of a full moon to take an unauthorized tour and crocodile egg robbery at the Zoolyard Garden. Similar to Thunderdome, 3 kids enter, 2 kids leave. Tim, one of the boys moves out of town and leaves his eggs behind. 15 years later Tim (Andrew Lee Potts) returns to town and reunites with his friend Baghi (Muzz Khan).

The town has some quirky characters including Uncle Stan (Justin Lee Collins) who likes snakes. The first hour of the film, things go slow.  At an hour we get a twist and a change in direction. These regular crocs lived for 15 years in the moors of Somerset Levels...in warm water, although not once did anyone espy them sunning themselves. These are regular crocs and not Lake Placid genetically modified dinosaur crocs. Once you get past that, the scene on the cover is not in the film either.

Four real crocs and two fake ones (and it is sooo easy to tell the difference)  were used for the film. This is a horror comedy and was a bit light on both. Certainly would have more appeal to a British audience who enjoy subtleties than an American audience who feast on blood and action.

8745777,2,B019PRS6EA,Stole from well done films and wasted it all. Not funny. Not frightening. No character stood out enough to like or hate. Preferred the croc. Liked the locations on the moors but not enough to get passed this Ho Hum flick from the UK.,1529020800,,233,4.318181818181818

8745783,1,B019PRS6EA,I'm not exactly sure how to catagorize this film. It's not really a horror movie and there isn't ant suspense. I wouldn't call it a horror comedy either since it's ot funny. It is a totally forgetable movie not really worth a rental. The special effects are pretty  lame and the acting was just as bad. I would keep my money and steer clear of this one. If you want to see a crocodile movie try Lake Placid or Rogue.,1460160000,2,416,4.2
8745784,1,B019PRS6EA,I love me some giant crocodile and alligator movies. Hated this one. Badly acted. Trite plot. Poor FX. There are so many better films in this sub-genre of creatures features. Skip this one,1460160000,2,188,4.7272727272727275
8745785,4,B019PRS6EA,"Oh this movie breaks so many molds of the typical B-horror genre. Granted a lot of the characters in it are old, and well used. But I really enjoyed the difference in the standard ending to one of these things",1459641600,,209,4.25
8745786,2,B019PRS6EA,"This was basically a UK version of Lake Placid. Not the best killer crocodile movie thats for sure. The crocodile looked very cheap looking. I did enjoy the scenery, some great looking shots. The 2 goofy characters were probably the saving grace of this movie. The dvd cover is very misleading and the ending was pretty rushed too. They definitely could have done more with the crocodile, not enough scenes with the creature. Its an ok creature feature, but lacks bite! 2.5/5",1459036800,,475,4.804878048780488
