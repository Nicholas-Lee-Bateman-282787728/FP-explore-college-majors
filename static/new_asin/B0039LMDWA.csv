8392096,5,B0039LMDWA,"This multipurpose dvd is worth every penny and then some. Besides the meditative and relaxation purposes stated in the description, it can also act as a stimulant... if you have cats like I do. They find it to be great safe indoor entertainment with the bird sounds turned on :) Bet it will be great ""medicine"" on a sleepless night as well. I love living in the desert, but this dvd takes me away to another gorgeous environment in a flash. I'll definitely buy other dvds in the series. Thanks for a very affordable getaway of mind, sight and sound.",1272585600,,549,4.5
