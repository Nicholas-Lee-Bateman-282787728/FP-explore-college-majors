8434481,3,B004LLIRN6,This movie was ok. But it would have been better if Kasheen himself did more of the talking. Theres another dude from the block that pretty much takes up the entire documentary that was supposed to be for Kasheen. But as a New Yorker its always dope to hear about certain street legends. Good but could have been much better,1389139200,,324,4.416666666666667

LOL! then his lil' sidekick (Guytony) doin' a lot of co-signing on his man's legendary status but they both act like they still got cases pending because they both not really saying nothing! i labled this review public service announcement so you won't spend your doe! i don't know if dude is still active in the streets... but if you buy this dvd (so called documentary) you'll be his newest stick up victim, sad to say he already got me! ugh!",1354492800,2,825,4.329032258064516
