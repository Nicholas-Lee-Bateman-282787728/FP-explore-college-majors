I think the only movie that beats it (with these two guys together) is ""Of Mice And Men."" These two are just fantastic playing opposite each other. They really should have made more movies together.

I think Gary Sinise is an underrated actor, he really should have won ""Best Actor"" award for his role in ""Forrest Gump"" (even though I love Hanks, I didn't care for his performance in that movie.) I've never seen Malkovich better than in ""True West"" and ""Of Mice And Men.""

Get ""True West"" if you can find it.

Someone really needs to get this on DVD so other people can enjoy it before it is ""lost"" forever. I'll keep my VHS player always just for gems like this!",1503532800,,922,4.281609195402299
8064105,5,B0009OFD4U,"Great low budget film of classic Shepard play starring Malkovich and Sinese. Arrived within days, VHS needed for viewing in school, great shape.
This production tracks the wonderful live production of True West which ran at the Cherry Lane Theater in the mid-1980's, and made people laugh so hard they fell out of their chairs -- not the Public Theater production with Tommy Lee Jones and Peter Boyle, which was poorly directed.",1473379200,,428,4.958333333333333

8064107,5,B0009OFD4U,Please put this on DVD!  One of my absolute favorite stage productions.  I could watch it 100 times.,1437523200,,100,4.5
8064108,5,B0009OFD4U,"I was so happy to be able to find this, even in VHS format. This movie is almost claustrophobic in its intensity as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise engage in a psychological battle of wills. This is a videotaped stage performance of Sam Shepard's play, so it is filmed on a small set, which just adds to the tension between the two brothers. The acting is just so well done that 30 years later I remember seeing this play and had to get the video.",1409097600,,446,4.258823529411765
8064109,5,B0009OFD4U,"Well performed and well cast. If you like Sam Sheppard, this is a must see. Excellent value for the money.",1383004800,,106,4.35
8064110,5,B0009OFD4U,"If you have never seen this version of the play you are truly missing out. I first saw it in college when a girl I knew in a drama class introduced it to me. I have watched it many many times over the past 27 years and never tire of its humor and the brilliant acting by two veteran actors who were just starting out. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, you either get it or you don't. It is definitely not for everyone. If you do, grab some toast, sit back and be prepared to be thoroughly entertained. DAMN THESE CRICKETS!!!!",1286928000,3,532,4.174757281553398
8064111,5,B0009OFD4U,"I first seen this play on an encore presentation on PBS's ""Great Performances"" in 1997. It has become since, ""one of my favourite's of ALL TIME!"" Two brothers, one a successful screenwriter(Austin), the other, a recluse drifter and hustler who's been living out in the desert, but always trying to make a quick buck(Lee). Austin is trying to sell a screenplay to a Hollywood producer while taking care of his Mother's house while she's away in Alaska. His Brother, Lee, untimely shows up and turns his brother's life upside down! Lee manages to convince Austin's producer friend(Saul Kimmer)to get Austin to write his own screenplay idea? Saul loses a bet with Lee on a round of golf and in turn must go with Lee's screenplay instead? Austin is furious that the screenplay he worked so hard on is now being ""thrown out the window""! Midway through the movie, the brothers switch roles. Lee must somehow write his own screenplay on the ""Contemporary West""? While Austin, feeling that he lost all hope of making it big in Hollywood, decides to give up and live out in the desert. The two brother go into battle for some kind of escape? In the end, no one wins? This is a brilliant production of the Sam Shepard play by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company with Gary Sinise as ""Austin"" and John Malkovich as ""Lee"". Two of the greatest actors of our time! This a must-see for anyone who has ever considered being a Theatre major or who just enjoys comedic dramas!!!",1258848000,4,1455,4.6875
8064112,5,B0009OFD4U,"Two fine actors when they were still young and HUNGRY. If you like your acting brimming with absolute manic passion and pathos, then this is your new favorite. I first viewed this on a home made tape that my best friend's older sister had made from a PBS airing in 1983. She suggested that we watch it and that is how two 13 year old girls became utterly obsessed with the fantastically perverse story of two brothers locked in a battle of wills over the writing of a screenplay. While nothing about this production is ""Hollywood"" in any way, the promise, corruption and desperation of the town loom large in the background. It's best experienced and not described, but I have only grown fonder of it over the 23 years and uncountable viewings since I first experinced it. I'm not one to see films over and over in general, but this one never loses it's intensity and strange beauty for me. People either ""get it"" and laugh harder than they ever have and demand multiple rewinds, or they kind of sit uncomfortably wondering why tears are streaming from my eyes as I laugh myself into complete hysterics. Best viewed with beer and toast on hand. Enjoy!",1154563200,11,1151,4.592233009708738
