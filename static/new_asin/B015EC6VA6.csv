7433575,3,B015EC6VA6,"Enlightening documentary, but I believe no backpacker is going to watch it. Basically, it covers the tracks of 20-something middle-class backpackers, mostly from the U.S.A. (gringos) looking to binge-drinking, fornicate and do drugs while on vacation in 'cool' remote places in poorer countries.

How are targeted these places? Because they are secluded, remote, unregulated, exotic and you can go back home and tell you've been there and get ""Ooooh!"" of surprise by your friends. Quite dull to start with.

That's a fringe of tourism, and I would have liked to see a more comprehensive take about the positive effects as well, and maybe some insights on why thing start going downhill (is public regulation the only way?). I have never been a backpacker but overall the message i got from this documentary is that you are selfish if you want to visit remote areas.

I think the documentary needs some closure and should have scratched more in depth this phenomenon.",1467417600,2,966,5.025

The issues of traveler perspective; learning; and  sometimes  ill-considered impact on their host environments were well presented in a beautifully fresh and  insightful way. The inclusion of environmental planning examples was encouraging and will be helpful for travelers in their preparation for their future trips.

I totally appreciated this film and recommend  it to travelers, touristy guides and also those wanting  reflective discussions about the topic.",1453939200,,604,7.925373134328358

7433579,5,B015EC6VA6,"If youve read my other reviews on Amazon you might know that I love documentaries of all types. I always amazed at how a documentary filmmaker can put so much effort into filming a continuing story and not know where it will take them. In the case of this 79 minute film, the journey by director (and prominent anthropologist) Pegi Vail started in 1981 and ended in 2013. Thats a long time to complete a film.

The subject here is tourism and the effect it has on both local culture as well as the environment. Its not as preachy as it sounds. Vail lets the pictures tell the story. As more and more young people have the urge (and financial resources) to travel, they are looking for exotic places like South America. Africa and Asia. But, instead of travelling by themselves they join a herd of backpackers in organized tours and  while they think they are roughing it  they spend days taking photos and night partying and drinking. They also like nice accommodations so hotels spring up in rural communities and the locals do what they can to make money. But if tourism is planned and orchestrated then those pristine beaches and game lands get over crowded, the animals and birds leave and the natural beauty gores away (and with it the tourists  off to seek a new place.)

Vail follows some travel bloggers and writers (including an editor for National Geographic Traveler magazine) as they each discover new places. She then returns 10-20 years later to find the once-empty white beach overcrowded with party goers.  Youll get a lump in your throat seeing these scenes.

The travel writer and bloggers that she chose (about six if I remember) are all great speakers and draw you in with great stories. The scenery is gorgeous too. So you will find yourself drawn in to the film (at least I was).

The one thing that bothered me about what I learned is that  because of the need to preserve these special areas  those communities who have now a policy of planned tourism have determined that the only way to limit the tourists arriving is to charge a VERY high price to come there. The representative of Bhutan explains that they set a fee so high that only millionaires can come here and it limits the groups to a dozen or so persons at a time. But, I guess thats the way it has to be.

There are short (1-3 minute) bonus clips which add to the story. They total about 25 minutes.

If you love to travel, I can highly recommend this eye-opening film. If you are a backpacker I urge you to see it.

I was provided an advance screener in exchange for an honest review.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7433580,5,B015EC6VA6,"The documentary ""Gringo Trails"" directed by Pegi Vail does an effective and efficient job in informing its intended audience of academic scholars about the effects of anarchism in tourism. Before watching this documentary, I had a vague concept of the consequences of mass tourism.  After watching ""Gringo Trails"", I found out how imperative it is to develop sustainable tourism not only for the environment but also for the locals who are residents of touristic hotspots.  Locals and tourists discuss the unmonitored growth of tourism in undeveloped nations through well-narrated interviews. The well-managed camera angles and the sharp images enhance these primary sources making it feel like you are in remote jungles of Bolivia with Yossi.  My attention was captured in the first couple of minutes of film with the anecdote about Yossi. The Director Vail did a successful job in placing a cliffhanger causing myself to be intrigued. I would highly recommend this documentary to not only my academic peers but also anybody interested in the topic of tourism.",1506816000,,1061,5.266272189349112

It displays not only how tourism has evolved over time, but also how it has turned into a negative industry for most places. The documentary shows powerful images, and tells personal stories of people that have watched issues in tourism develop first-hand. Overall, I believe that Gringo Trails was very interesting, but I gave it only four out of five stars because there were some scenes that lost my attention.",1506816000,,520,4.988505747126437

The film did a great job in informing the audience of popular tourist destinations and what life is like and how they stay sustainable. Not only does it show how many destinations have become profitable and flourished, it also gave examples of communities such as Ko Pha Ngan and how it went from being untouched into a highly populated party beach that lost its natural beauty. This has opened my eyes into what goes on behind the scenes of some of the worlds popular tourist destinations.

The purpose of this documentary is to educate travelers and backpackers about the impact they are having on these destinations. The film explores destinations such as the Bolivian Amazon and Koh Phangan. One of the most eye-opening stories within the documentary was the story behind Koh Phangan. The documentary displays the impact that tourists have every year on New Years let alone daily. The tourists have no respect for the local culture, environment, or the local people on the land. Even though I am not a backpacker looking to set out on an adventure to a remote island, the film has tough me how to be more aware when traveling within the United States.",1506816000,,815,5.0

This film enlightens viewers on one of the most overlooked problems in the tourism industry: The destruction on the environment, culture and wildlife of the destination that tourists cause. This documentary jumps back and forth between multiple destinations and shows each place's individual struggle with creating a sustainable development of tourism. I enjoyed the interviews of people who have witnessed these adverse effects of tourism. Before viewing this movie I'd always only looked at the positive economic effects tourism had on countries. In the last few minutes of the film, they focused on how it's not too late to save other places. I strongly recommend viewing this film, just to understand host countries perspectives and how we can stop this problem.",1506816000,,907,5.305555555555555

It displays how tourism economically aids a location, while the tourists themselves destroy these scenic areas. Viewers get a deeper look into these negative impacts from local civilians and an environmental standpoint. One thing the film shows is how the Bolivian Amazon is becoming more and more destroyed due to the lack of consideration tourist have on the culture, environment, and to the wildlife. ""Gringo Trails"" defiantly wants to educate travelers on sustainable tourism and how to be respectful to the natives of any given area. This documentary is definitely worth watching because you get to learn about the culture, life, and existence of the places they film.",1506816000,,799,5.349206349206349

The documentary gave multiple examples of how tourism is a double-edge sword, and can have positive as well as negative impacts on an environment. In some cases, if properly managed, tourism can be a beneficial asset to an area. For example, the Himalayan Kingdom in Bhutan found a sustainable solution where tourism was limited, yet they were able to still succeed financially. On the other hand, a calm and peaceful beach in Thailand was exploited by an overpopulation tourists. The beach held a New Year party and as a result, it was severely polluted. The moral of the documentary is that tourists need to be mindful of what they leave behind, because it can have serious impacts on the area and its inhabitants. Pegi does an excellent job portraying how tourism can be a blessing and a curse through these stories shared in the film.",1506816000,,990,4.795321637426901
7433587,4,B015EC6VA6,"SPOILER : The Gringo Trails is very informative on the impact of tourism. The intended audience for the film are tourists and travelers. Pegi Vail, the director, shows how tourism affects the local area and even the native people. For example, while on the segment of the Bolivian Amazon, one local states that tourists threaten the population of local species like anacondas. I did not think about the effect on the ecosystem so that itself was eye-opening. The documentary was filmed in multiple spots such as the Bolivian Amazon, Timbuktu, and Koh Phangan. In many cases, tourism is shown to have a negative impact on many areas. In the case of Koh Phangan, Vail demonstrations how untouched the island was prior to the infestation of tourists by showing the clear, clean beach. However, to shed light on the negative impacts, Vail presents the viewers with different time frames of the island. In those time frames, the films saturation is heightened and becomes distorted when showing the nightlife. Truly, the film has given me an insightful take on travelling. I would recommend travelers to watch this documentary!",1506816000,,1122,5.037634408602151

It was made to show people, like millennials, who back pack in different parts of the world how much of an impact they have on the places they are visiting and that word of mouth is a lot more effective than they think. The message the director, Pegi Vail, is trying to send is that visiting these places  and telling other people to visit them can effect them immensely over time. As people start to visit more and more the true culture of the area diminishes because of the accomodations for tourists. It really made me think about how the people living in these places may feel and how tourism can negatively effect so many people.",1506816000,,784,4.640287769784172

It was eye opening to say the least. The film opens with the story of a backpacker, Yossi, who was swept away by floodwaters and had to survive on his own for a month. Tourism is usually viewed positively, but this film showed tourism in a different light. One of the issues this film touched on was tourisms effect on the environment. A disturbing image was shown of a beach trashed from tourists partying the night before.

The film also includes interviews with Americans and their expericne as foreigners in a new culture. Gringo Trails highlights how tourism effects the physical appearance of a country, its economy and culture and why locals do not appreciate foreign tourists.

Throughout the movie, you see the drastic and horrifying changes made to these destinations. The Amazon Jungle went from having one hotel in 1981 to having 45 hotels after a man almost died there and wrote a book about his experience, drawing thousands of people to the new and exciting place. In turn, anacondas are rapidly declining and many other species are in danger of losing their habitats. The interviews are insightful and allow viewers to see into the locals' minds and how they perceive tourism.

Backpacking is usually known as a form of tourism where visitors embrace the culture and environment they have entered. Unfortunately this film shows how once backpackers or tourists hear about a new place it becomes taken over with people trying to come up with their own stories. When a man was lost in  the Bolivian Amazon and ended up writing a book about his experiences, everyone who read his story wanted to have the same experience. Gringo Trails focused on the impacts tourism has on cultures, economies, and the environment. The film informs tourists about the impact they have on the places they venture to.

Little do tourists think about the damage they may bring upon societies while exploring the unknown. This documentary takes tourism and exposes the reality and dark side of the industry.
This film includes stories from backpackers traveling to undisclosed places, including the Amazon, Timbuktu, and Haad Rin beach. As word of mouth spread from these backpackers, more and more tourists began exploring these places. It was shocking to see how quick a society changed itself to fit the needs of tourists. The culture and practices of an area change, more stores and hotels pop up, and the area loses its original charm that the tourists originally came for.
With so many examples producing the same results, it shows how a majority of people do not understand biodiversity and sustainability. Gringo Trails does a strong job stressing how rules need to be set to help preserve the environment and culture. As the film states, take only memories.

By the use of natural scenery and locals' hometowns being changed by mass tourism, and personal stories created a sense of guilt revolving around mass tourism. By showing wildlife animals habitats' being effected negatively, it causes viewers to think more deeply about mass tourism and the dangers of it.

I also learned while watching this film that tourism can greatly impact cultures negatively. Tourists can travel to a country and damage the environment they are in without eve knowing it which is why all tourists need to be careful and know the type of environment they are going to be in.

The director shows the litter and trash left behind by the tourists, and how no one helped clean it up. It really shows the damage we as tourists cause to the homes of others.

The purpose of this documentary is to illustrate how the tourism industry can negatively effect a community that it reaches. The documentary overall did a good job of showing this by providing a perspective from the backpackers that allowed for the director to more easily get his point across.

I knew that tourism had some negative effects, but seeing how tourists come through and destroy the culture of an area definitely changed my views on the industry. Several stories told throughout the film detail the effects of tourism in developing countries. There are many scenes of overpopulated areas since there were no regulations put in place for tourism in these developing countries.

The movie includes stories from the author of ""Jungle"", Yossi Ghinsberg, a woman and her travel fantasy of experiencing Timbuktu, as well as several other powerful tales of travelers and their realizations of how they impacted their destinations. The film did a good job of incorporating different aspects of how tourism can affect the environment, but it also at times included random bits of stories that people interviewed and shared. Such as when the story was told of how this guy and his friend travelled to a foreign country and had an experience with two women whom they suspected to be prostitutes or thieves when in actuality they were just kind locals.

7433611,4,B015EC6VA6,"Gringo Trails, a tourism documentary, tells about the experience of traveling to Bhutan, Bolivia, Thailand and more. Madidi Tours gives travelers an unforgettable experience down 120 miles of river, seeing alligators, anacondas, and culture throughout Bolivia. Be careful to remember, We are guests in another culture. A road in Thailand, known as the salt desert is explained to be an open pathway for cars, each making their own trail. Even though (it is assumed) Americans and people in Thailand are completely different, cars in Thailand have the steering wheel on the same side as Americans. Gringo Trails is an amazing way to learn about different cultures, but also how tourism is causing it to erode. The documentary should be required in any tourist related seminar, so that people can see what tourism really does to the population of those tourist destinations.",1474329600,,872,5.191489361702128
7433612,4,B015EC6VA6,"Gringo Trails takes the viewer on a journey through some of Earths most remote places and explores how mass tourism, specifically backpackers, has disrupted the culture and environment of these locations.  This documentary can speak to everyone, and is meant to catch the attention of people outside of the tourism industry to raise awareness of a growing problem.  I viewed this documentary to supplement things I am learning in an intro to hospitality and tourism course and I did not expect this film to draw as much concern from me as it did.  The anecdotes from different travelers are gripping and raise many questions about how we should behave when we travel and what is respectful and right.  The documentary follows the evolution of a couple of places from their untouched state in the 1980s to backpacker hotspots in the 2000s and 2010s.  Not only does the documentary present gripping memoirs but it also provides haunting imagery of damage caused on beaches and in the wildlife by tourists.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is considering backpack travel so they can understand what their impact is on these remote areas they want to visit cheaply.",1474156800,,1171,4.918781725888325
7433613,3,B015EC6VA6,"Gringo trails in a refreshing film with elaborate visuals that take you to exotic places like Timbuktu and the Koh Pangan. The beginning of the film tells the story of Yossi, a backpacker who was lost in the Amazon for nearly a month and managed to survive. As the film progresses, the plot takes a turn which was quite confusing at first, and begins to talk about travel destinations like the salt desert Salar de Uyuni to show how tourism has changed them over the years, sadly for the worse. Tackling issues like the lack of respect people have for different cultures when traveling, its the kind of film that really makes you stop and think. However, while I enjoyed the message the director was trying to convey, I believe the plot could have flowed much more smoothly. Still, it was worth the watch, and I would highly recommend it if only for the environmental issues it brings to your attention.",1474070400,,903,4.614906832298137
7433614,4,B015EC6VA6,"I watched Gringo Trails and thought that it was informing.  This documentary opened my eyes to the world of travel and tourism especially with how foreigners treat land that is not their own.  I feel that this could be made better by having more explanation of some of the places that were shown and what they bring to the country rather than just this is a place in Bolivia that brings tourists because this.  I think if it was released to the general public, in theaters for example, those who saw it would maybe have a different outlook on things when they traveled next, but I do not think that it would draw a large crowd. Parts of this film were dark but were real eye openers to things that we do in other places when we are not thinking about others.",1474070400,,758,4.323943661971831
7433615,3,B015EC6VA6,"This film is intended to highlight the long-term impact that tourism has on cultures, economies, and the environment and it does just that. Although director Pegi Veil successfully conveyed her message, the film seemed to be rather ""anti-tourism"". There were good examples to showcase economic and environmental issues throughout the film however there was not a clear enough example of cultural issues in my opinion. Also, the stories from travelers, although interesting, were not fully relevant and felt out of place. Overall, the film was very informative and interesting however as a traveler it was hard to not feel like I just watched an hour and sixteen minutes worth of guilt tripping.",1473984000,,694,5.205357142857143

He and three other backpackers backpacked along the Amazon. He was lost for 25 days. He then decided he wanted to write a book to tell about his adventure. As the documentary continues, the focus switches from Yossi to other tourists who have traveled to many different places around the world. I believe Vail wanted to present a ""behind the scenes"" clip of how tourists around the world are viewed not only by the public, but by the locals of the town they visited. In the end, Yossi returns to Bolivia, 11 years later, and starts community-based tourism. I personally loved the documentary, not only because it explores Yossi and his adventures in Bolivia, but gives people an inside look on the adventures and hardships of tourists in general.",1473897600,,867,4.864864864864865

The film starts by telling the story of Yossi. Yossi is a backpacker who had been lost on the Gringo Trail for 25 days. His miraculous rescue story evoked other backpackers to travel to the trail. The film also extends to show backpackers in other countries. The backpackers wanted a experience that you cannot find in a hotel. However, those experiences came with a cost. A cost that isn't payed by the travelers, but instead the environment and culture. The film gives you many different perspectives, these perspectives give you a new appreciation for people everywhere and the world around you. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.",1473897600,,825,4.9

It open my eyes to many problems that come with tourism. It made me realize that traveling, while fun, is not something to be takin lightly. I think this movie did a great job showing all the affects of tourism with videos, pictures, and stories. This movie will make you sit back and really think about your past actions when you have traveled, your future actions, and will make you a little angry because of the carelessness of some people.",1473897600,,580,4.429906542056075

Throughout the film the audience learns how the tourism industry varies from region to region and how it can impact the environment in both positive and negative ways. The interview with Yossi, a backpack who survived the jungles of Bolivia, shows how a person who suffered from an environment can end up giving back to that environment inspiring people to want to make a change. Through the use of interviews and by giving examples of positive and negative impacts on environments due to tourism, the film is able to educate the audience on global tourism. It's amazing how the film includes several interviews, uncensored visuals, and subtitles for unfamiliar language. One hasn't watched a documentary film until they've watched Gringo Trails.",1473724800,,784,5.181102362204724

8733275,4,B015EC6VA6,"The film gringo trails is definitely an eye opening documentary about the footprint that modern backpacking tourism has left on some of the globe's most treasured destinations. I found it to be very informational but for the film to truly be an accomplishment the message must reach a decent portion of the backpacking community which I do not believe it has done.  The film had excellent directing and a powerful message but I just don't believe it will make much of an impact on the industry because not enough of those within the community have seen it.
  Overall, it is worth the watch. I enjoyed it and it definitely brought my attention to a problem that I knew very little about, if it can be brought to the attention of more people it will be an overwhelming success.",1506902400,,775,4.601449275362318
8733276,5,B015EC6VA6,"The documentary Gringo Trails was an extremely effective and insightful work. Aimed at tourist audiences, it provided important information on what happens to places when they become too popular. It provided several strong contrasts along what is known as the gringo trail, following the stories of several locations, such as the Amazon jungle and Salt Flats in Bolivia. Each place was presented as a before, with picturesque scenery and few outside influences and an after, with destructive tourism effects being displayed. The director, Pegi Vail, does an outstanding job in illustrating the negative effects of tourism and bringing awareness to proper and sustainable tourism. The number of interviews was fantastic and brought helpful, first hand insight to the problem. I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who travels, especially someone who is considering traveling to a more remote location.",1506816000,,914,5.535714285714286
