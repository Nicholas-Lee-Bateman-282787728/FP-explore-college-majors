8705421,3,B00UCKGULG,"We were very disappointed by the contents of this disc, which does not present an overview of New Zealand as anticipated.  It started out with a discussion of gliders, as we watched two people go up in one and learned about thermals and ""disconnecting.""  Then there was a lengthy ""lesson"" on how New Zealand derives 70% of its electricity from hydro power.  After that, we learned about the practices of salmon farming, sheep farming and auctioneering, and wine making.  The video ended with some scary images of climbers on Mount Cook and finally actually showed some impressive views downward from above snow-capped peaks.  Overall, it was primarily an introduction to the energy policies, economics and life styles of New Zealand, whereas we were more interested in the country's varied landscapes.",1477267200,,801,5.130769230769231

8705426,4,B00UCKGULG,"Very interesting. Many things I did not know about the South Island. I personally did not find it quite as compelling as several of the other videos about the South and North Islands, but that just may be personal preference. Very well done, though -- I learned a lot.",1454371200,,268,4.489795918367347
