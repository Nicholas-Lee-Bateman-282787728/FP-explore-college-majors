8176446,5,B000NAS7N4,This makes an excellent gift for a baby shower.  I've given it to several of my expectant friends and they've loved it.,1207526400,,119,4.409090909090909
8176447,5,B000NAS7N4,"The Fit and Giggles exercises was an effective, practical and realistic workout.  My wife and I found that our newborn always wanted to be held, so why not get back into shape at the same time!  My wife's wrists stopped hurting because of the Fit and Giggles strengthening exercises, and my back stopped hurting because of the flexibility exercises.  We were very impressed with the results.  While it was mom who had the baby, both of us had to get back into shape!  ;)",1172361600,2,470,4.5476190476190474
8176448,5,B000NAS7N4,"The workout is broken out into short sections that you can do separately or together. There aren't many workouts that a new mom has time for, but this one can be done! It's a great way to build up strength or spread the workout through the day (or week). Bringing the baby in for some of the moves is both practical for the mom and fun for the baby. Love it!!!",1172016000,2,360,4.084507042253521
