8169166,1,B000MGBLZ0,"Set in a parallel universe style Argentina in 2009, concerning a masked vigilante avenger, Sadomaster is a horrifically bad, godawful film, that fails spectacularly on every conceivable level. Shot cheaply on camcorder has atrocius acting, woeful production values, and truly shoddy fx.
Sadomaster has been hyped online as THE film for all fans of extreme cinema.
It isn't.
The film became known for its ""infamous"" rape scene of a retarded guy. You'll know the guy is retarded, btw-he sniffs a rose with exaggerated glee, is dressed like a child, has a stupid propellor hat, and gurns shamelessly at the camera in a ""Yes-I-am-retarded-and-if-you-don't-believe-me-then-check-out-my-stupid-hat"" type manner.
A news reporter character can be seen visibly stifling laughter.
Another character sports an obviously fake Pancho Villa style mustache.
The fx? In a beating scene the baseball bat bends in a suspiciously foamy manner. Several times.
The supposedly ""graphic""rape scene is actually laughable, something I never thought I'd post regarding a rape scene. Yhe rapist's penis is obviously plastic.
Another ""controversial"" scene is the baby scene. The baby is a glaringly obvious, intelligence insulting doll. The camera cheerfully stays on said dolls face in order to dispell doubts among the REALLY retarded viwers out there, that it isn't in fact a doll.
The film also uses pointless 9/11 footage apparently for the shock value.

Extras.
Not much really apart from interviews from the director who's under the baffling delusion that his film is in any way good.

In conclusion, I urge all horror fans (particularly fans of extreme cinema) To avoid this incompetent pile of lameness and under no circumstances waste your money. It's not even so bad its good. It's just plain bad untalented filmaking, that was a crushing dissapointment to this extreme horror fan anyway. And that's being charitable.
