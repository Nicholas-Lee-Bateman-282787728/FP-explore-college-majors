8170208,3,B000AYARKE,I did feel the dvd was a bit on the short side. I wouId have liked to see a bit more footage (and audio!) of the wide variety of cars that ran in the endurance series. I kept wishing I could turn off the 80's synthesizer music and commentating in some parts.  Are their better motorsports dvds out there? Perhaps. But it's still got some great content and overall I am still pleased with this one.,1369699200,,397,4.223684210526316
