1364453,2,B00004WGA2,"I got this DVD at a Coconuts Bargain Bin and I don't regret my purchase, just that the translators of Prehistoric Planet took all the character out of the cosmonauts, often taking their dialogue concerning life on other planets and turning it into meaningless chit chat. The character of Kern suffers the most. His anti-human over machine attitude and his love for jazz are completely eliminated. Instead of a specific jazz piece he whistles in the Russian print, and the same piece played by John the Robot, we are given a toneless whistle from Kern and a non-specific filler song from John.
The print of Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet is no better or worse than the original Russian print. It's nice to have a DVD of Planet of Storms in some form. Pity the original, Planeta Burg, hasn't been preserved on DVD.
As for First Spaceship, there's a better print available, but if you want to see it the way you remembered it from Creature Feature on Saturday Afternoons, this is the print hired out to TV stations.
In the final analysis, if you're a fan of Prehistoric Planet, get the original subtitled Russian version.",1008547200,4,1120,4.719387755102041
1364454,3,B00004WGA2,"Sure, the quality of this DVD is not good, but actually it works quite well for these movies, of witch the first is definitely very boring, but the other has a nice eerie atmosphere and is actually well crafted. A good price-quality thing here anyway.",1001635200,,251,4.6
1364455,1,B00004WGA2,"If there is a clearer illustration of getting what you pay for than this bottom-of-the-barrel transfer from Diamond Entertainment, I hope I never see it. The print of First Spaceship on Venus is from the butchered Crown International release and is in rough shape. The contrast is horrible, the colors run from oversaturated to faded and the full screen images are just that - full screen images. No pans or scans here! The print of Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet is in better shape. This is the American International Television version and is again presented in full screen minus any attempts to pan and scan. Colors are faded and there are actually a couple of emulsion flakes caught in the film gate (shades of high school projection). Both films are just as confusing and slow as I remember them from their original release. The ancillary material on disc is amateurish and worthless. This DVD is a waste even at this price.",1000339200,6,931,4.788819875776397
1364456,4,B00004WGA2,"If you buy this movie thinking you are getting something that will remind you of Mission to Mars or Armageddon, you will be sadly mistaken, probably many, many times in your life.  If you buy this movie because you like crazy, old movies about silly things happening in outerspace (like astronauts landing on Venus and popping open their helmets to breathe the air, and toteing around hulking robots who don't seem to have any function other than to hulk), and like to compare the knowledge of space then to knowledge now, you will find these two movies to be fulfilling!  Watch them both, and compare the crews' attitudes to travel, equipment, each other, the mission etc.  Then compare those attitudes to modern space travel and modern space movies.  It is an interesting thing to do at 1:00 am when you can't sleep.",991267200,5,818,4.73943661971831
1364457,3,B00004WGA2,Hold on reviewer #1! This ain't Matrix but both films are quite watchable. The image quality of First Spaceship is as good as anything I've seen on VHS and Voyage is very good. Together provide an interesting look at the Communist bloc sci-fi of the era and the fx stand up pretty well against most of what was coming out of Hollywood at the time. Widescreen and extras would be nice but it IS only seven bucks for the two films. That's $3.50 per. A bargain for a fun double feature.,976492800,7,483,4.318681318681318
1364458,1,B00004WGA2,"This review is for the ""DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT"" DVD ONLY. In a few words: It's terrible. Yes, there are two films on a single disk -- but  they are very, very poor transfers of each film.
""First Spaceship on  Venus"" (FSOV) -- I saw this one at the late Markham Theater in  Columbus, Ohio back in the early 60s. As a wide-eyed child, I saw it as an  impressive-looking, very widescreen production. And I ordered this thinking  it was widescreen. I was wrong.  On the Diamond DVD, FSOV is presented in  pan & scan format. The image quality is very, very poor at best. In  appearance, it's akin to a many-generations down the line miserable dub of  a pirated video. The colors appear to be -- for lack of better words --  washed out, bloated, contrasty. I just don't quite know how to convey how  bad this looks. The mono sound is echoey. No effort was expended in this  travesty of a transfer.
""Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet"" (VPP)  --  I never saw this in a theater. I gather this is the AIP version of a  Russian film ""Planeta Burg"" or ""Planet of Storms"". Actually, this is a better film than FSOV. I'd like to see this one restored to its original glory. Unfortunately, like  Raymond Burr in the US release of the very first ""Godzilla"",  scenes with have been added to make it more agreeable to English-speaking  audiences. Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue play very minor, virtually  throwaway parts. I don't know whether or not the original film was  widescreen but on the Diamond DVD it's presented ""full screen"".  The video image, while not as bad as FSOV, is still very poor. The sound is  mono.
No subtitles. Virtually non-existent extras.
If you're looking  for a high quality DVD of either film, look elsewhere. The ""Image  Entertainment"" release of FSOV has got to be better. At least they did  a decent job on ""Destination Moon"".
I'm sending this  ""Diamond Entertainment"" DVD back where it came from. There's NO  excuse for this low quality on DVD.",969408000,4,1960,4.605797101449276
1364479,5,B00004WGA2,I saw this movie years ago with my brother on late night TV.  We loved the movie and sad when it didn't pop up on TV more.  I bought the DVD because my brother is on the missing persons list and having the movie gives me warm memories.,1233014400,,235,3.875
1364480,3,B00004WGA2,"Unfortunately, even though First Spaceship on Venus was filmed in 2.35:1, the film is presented here in 1.33:1... might be less!!!!
I can't even begin to speak about the second film.
The case reads Fully Restored...hhhmmm.... do they mean they took it out of the garbage can and ran in through a projector onto a wall, then filmed it with a digital camera!?!.... Yep, thats not an overstatement... its that bad.
Beside the horrendous quality of the presentation, both films are highly enjoyable !!!  Really!
So, if you can get this double set for $1 or 2, then go for it. If you want to see it in a quality presentation, go for another, seperate edition.",1226188800,2,654,4.637931034482759
1364481,4,B00004WGA2,"This movie dates from the height of the Sputnik era. Despite that, or maybe because it wasn't made by one of the then-superpowers, it avoids the panicky, militant tone of so many movies back then. It starts with an artifact found in Tunga (would that be Tunguska, in English?), determined to be of alien origin. An international research team forms to analyze the recording in the object, then to visit its source on Venus. In flight, it is decoded as an invasion plan - but saying much more than that would lead to spoilers. The plot as a whole tends toward the predictable, but has enough novelty in it, even now, to hold the viewer's attention.

The international crew looks strikingly like that on Roddenberry's initial ""Star Trek"" series a few years later: no two from any one country, one black, one woman (two different people this time), etc. The woman, Sumiko, is the medical officer - nurse - and is somewhat stuck in the female stereotype. Her makeup is always impeccable, if heavy, and she's the one allowed to have visible emotions. One of the other characters gives her the ""you should be having babies"" talk at one point, with the clear implication that he's offering the biologically necessary help. And yes, she has to be saved at least once. Outside of that, she has a postive role, and represents an interesting mid-way point between Flash Gordon's ineffectual Dale Arden and the wholly capable Ripley character from the Alien movies.

The movie does have a few cheesy moments, like visible strings bouncing the alien bugs around, wobbly ground carts, obligatory meteor storms, and 50s/60s optical effects. For its day and budget, though it's surprisingly good. This, like the Solaris movies, is said to be a film version of one of Stanislaw Lem's books, but I don't recognize which one. I'll be interested to find out which book it's from and to see what the adaptation did to it. That's just an aside, though. The movie stands by itself, and well above many others of the time.

1364482,5,B00004WGA2,"The First Run Features DVD release of THE SILENT STAR is terrific, sku 20229 91167. I felt privileged to see the widescreen uncut version of this underrated and visionary Science Fiction film. The colors are fantastic and the movie is so much more effective presented in its original version. My only quibbles are that the DVD is not anamorphically enhanced for wide screen televisions and on my screen the bottom part of the subtitles was cut off. They were still readable and this will not occur on square TVs. Just a quibble, for I strongly endorse this DVD release and hope to see a lot more from First Run Features.",1140134400,7,620,4.6454545454545455
1364483,4,B00004WGA2,"If you've ever seen one of the hacked up cheap issues of Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" and then seen the carefully restored version, this will be dega vu. This ""Silent Star"" is hardly recognizable as ""First Spaceship On Venus"". Turns out the cheezy photography and murk as if it were shot through Venusian goo was the effect of the Hollywood retouch. The intelligent dialogue was dumbed down before it was poorly dubbed. Just as example the African character - literally a brief visual black hole in ""First"" - is a fully developed very intelligent character in ""Silent"" with a very touching final moment and a complexion similar to Sidney Pointier (can a film negetive transfer be inherently racist?). And the set design and very painterly special effects are unique in the Venus sequences (on or above the level of ""This Island Earth"" but better serving the story). The restored electronic music adds at least as much to the film as the score for ""Forbidden Planet"" did for that film, shot nearly simeotaneously. Seeing this version of the film, it's better than ""Forbidden"", more adult and intelligent on a similar theme. I've seen politicized reviews of this as if it's a Communist tract; but it just isn't there. Space was always a cooperative enterprise, be it Nasa or the Soviet Union; it was the politicization of NASA that destroyed it. The American character is just as prominent and important as any - in fact he's the one who dreams. For any serious sci-fi fan, this is a must - and if Kubrick learned how not to do background stars from this, that isn't all he picked up for ""2001"". Not to mention Gene Roddenberry. If not for a few routine disposable plot points (meteorites, love interest), this would be a five; but if you are a fan of space films, add a point.",1137628800,8,1776,4.677316293929713
1364484,4,B00004WGA2,"Well, after 40 some years I finally saw the uncut version of the European release, The Silent Star. The American title was, First Spaceship On Venus. Back around 1961 when I was a little boy my Mother took me to the theater in Toronto to see, First Spaceship on Venus. I loved it. When this movie finally came out on DVD I ordered it. Unfortunately the picture quality and sound was horrible. I bought it a second time when it was remastered. This copy was much better but it still was the American version that was edited, the voices were dubbed,and music added. The release of Silent Star on DVD finally shows this film as it was originally intended. The 20 minutes missing from the American version  are here along with the orignal voices of the crew (with sub-titles) and the original music (what there is of it). I always thought that the film was cut because it ran to long. How wrong I was. This movie was made in a Communist Country and the Cold War was at it's peak. The parts that were removed were propaganda pure and simple. The cut parts of the movie talks about who the real threat is (the imperialist West) There are several references to the bombing of Hiroshima. At this point I need to explain the movie a little bit. Short and to the point, the inhabitants of Venus want to destroy all of mankind by using lethal does of radiation. Things go terribly wrong on Venus and they end up destroying themselves. See the reference to Hiroshima yet? The message is, we destroyed Hiroshima and will probably destroy ourselves. Of course they left out a slight detail called Pearl Harbor. For 40 years I just thought this was a SCFI popcorn eating movie. If you are a fan of, First Spaceship To Venus then this latest original version is a must have. The picture quality is excellent and the story line doesn't really change. In this version they do a little better job of explaing what's going on SO your not scratching your head so much. The film was a way ahead of it's time because the crew was truly international. This was unheard of in the fifties. Everyone was and equal regardess of Country, skin, or gender. Not until the Star Trek series did we really see anything like this. The special effects, are as good and in some cases a cut above many of the so called scfi movies of the time. The only thing that I liked better on the American version was the music. I felt it fit the movie and created more drama. The DVD of The Silent Star also has a special feature section that gives bio information of the people who made this movie. It also shows the original European trailers among other things. Summing it all up. The Silent Star was a movie very much of it's time.",1132358400,21,2686,4.426262626262626
1364485,5,B00004WGA2,"There's a glaring error in the review provided by David Laughton on Oct. 7, 2005. He lists the running time of this DEFA Sci Fi Collection release of SILENT STAR as 80 minutes.

This DVD does NOT run 80 minutes. It runs 95 minutes and is, in fact, the longest version available to date, the additional 15 minutes infusing the film with a much more obvious socialist subtext. It's doubtful there was ever a 130 minute  ""uncut"" version of this film, as claimed in many sources. In all likelihood, that number first surfaced in the Leonard Maltin video guide and was then repeated verbatim in other film publications.

Also, this film contains ALL the extras from the University of Massachusetts library DVD which, at the time of this writing, has been reduced to a more reasonable $24.95 (still cheaper here at Amazon), although certain rights clearances can drive the price of that disc upwards of $124.95 depending on the required use. If the UMass version previously featured commentaries, which I believe it might have, it does not now, which makes it identical to this version.

So, just remember, in case Amazon does not fix this error, this version of SILENT STAR runs 95 minutes and has all the extras contained in the UMass edition. It's also a far superior version, even in its non-anamorphic form, to any public domain DVD bearing the U.S. re-edit FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS.",1131494400,9,1382,4.794117647058823

1364487,3,B00004WGA2,"The prints for both movies are in rough shape, but I personally found the movies entertaining and watchable nonetheless.
I bought this DVD primarily for ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" (which, as a previous viewer pointed out, used footage from the Russian ""Planeta Burg"") which I hadn't seen since the mid 70s. Despite the obvious flaws and rough condition of the print, it's still a great movie, and I'm glad it was offered even in this budget form.
I think a far more interesting DVD compilation would have been to  pair up ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" with ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" (which also employed the same ""Planeta Burg"" footage), or better yet, offer all 3 movies, the original ""Planeta Burg"", ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" and ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" on the same disc ,
rather than the choice of ""First Spaceship on Venus"".

""First Spaceship"" it still an entertaining movie, despite its poor quality, but for hard-core enthusiasts it is already available elsewhere on another disc in the widescreen format, so apparently it's already received a 5 star treatment.

7925239,4,B00004WGA2,"Very good 1960 East German-Polish made, English sub-titled color sci-fi film.  A multi-national crew of scientists (what? no armed air force muscle) travel to Venus to investigate the origins of 40 year old crash debris found in Tunguska, Siberia (AHHH, so that's what happened out there).  What they find is a devastated, irradiated landscape and no living anything.  It seems the Venusians had planned to bomb Earth (whether to invade or just plain destroy I'm not sure) but their machinery got out of hand and they ended up destroying themselves.  An interesting moment is when they find the burned shadows of some victims on a wall.  Shades of Hiroshima.  In fact Hiroshima is mentioned a lot, but no references to Pearl Harbor.  Aside from that most political or propaganda (except for some small jabs at American military attitudes) was supposedly edited from American releases.  Aside from that not a bad ride.  The Venusian scenic are wonderfully weird but not overly high-budgeted.  The Earth spaceship (called The Cosmokrator) is probably one of the most beautiful vessels ever created for the movies.  The DEFA DVD is very good quality.  The picture is clear and the color is fine.  My only complaint is the picture is surrounded by black bands all around.  Not full screen and not exactly widescreen.  Other than that a good buy.  Highly recommended.

If you are curious of Science Fiction film, this is worth a watch for all the things it does.  We see utilitarian robots working with humans.  We see an intricate spacecraft interior.  We travel to another world that is different from ours and meet aliens(?) that are different from us.  With all the wild bombastic spectacle thrown at us in modern sci-fi movies, this one appeals (at least to me) because it doesn't suffer from a need to over impress.

7925245,5,B00004WGA2,"I have a very interesting history with ""Silent Star"".  The American dubbed version ""First Spaceship on Venus"" was one of the first films I saw on the big screen.

I first saw ""First Spaceship on Venus"" in the early sixties at our local 3rd run movie theater.  At the time I was too young to understand that it was not an American made film and had been dubbed into English.  For that matter I don't think I really understood what was going on in the film.  All that was important to me was that it was in color and on a screen much bigger than my TV set.  And several years before Star Trek I was excited to see a black actor in a role that was presented as something other than comic relief.  It was still some time before I discovered that it was a condensed version of a Soviet Bloc made film.

I am very happy to finally get the chance to see and own a copy of the film on DVD as it was originally present.  And it should come as no surprise that the original release is a far greater work than the American dubbed version.

Based on the first published SF work of Stanislaus (Solaris) Lem, Silent Star"" concerns the discovery of evidence that visiters from the planet Venus once tried to contact earth and an international team of astronuts traveling to our sister planet in the attempt to discover why we have heard nothing since that first attempt at contact.  There the astronauts at cost of life and limb solve the mystery and return to earth.

""Silent Star"" is not bubble gum Sci-Fi but while a bit dated in its anti nuke proganda is still hard SF.  Some may find some of its anti-American attitude (this was forced upon the script by the then Socalist government) hard to take.  This anti-American attitude is strongly played up in a scene set in New York where a group of American scientists try to convince one of their group who had been invited to take part in the trip not to join in.  ""We are stronger with you than without you,"" one scientist tells him.  The invited scientist decides to go anyway when another older scientist complains that all his life he had been force to work on bombs and not allowed to do what he wanted to do and that the invited scientist should go ahead and join in on the trip to Venus.  I allowed all this to pass by me because I have seen several simular scenes in American films of the 50's.  Check out Gene Berry's ""The 27th Day.""

""Silent Star"" was made in an attempt to match the production values of American films of the time and the film makers largely succeed at that.  The model of the spaceship is a very original creation and the surface of the planet Venus with its wavy atmosphere is a wonderous set.

If you only know this film from the American dub or it MSK presentation don't allow that to stop you from seeing the original version.",1365552000,2,2796,4.318007662835249
7925246,4,B00004WGA2,"This review is for The Silent Star, in widescreen, the 95-minute version, German with English subtitles.  This is the original, uncut, remastered special edition, which can be had on its own or within The DEFA sci-fi collection of three films.  Ive never seen the butchered version of this film so I cant comment on that.

As far as this film goes, the first problem to overcome is the language barrier, if you don't speak German (with English subtitles).  The second problem is the subtitles.  They are yellow in color, one line using the movie as a background, the lower line easily read against the black space below the film.  As anyone knows, readability is nigh on impossible when words are plastered against a mix of colors, more often than not in motion.  It also doesnt help that most of the time they are not on screen long enough to read and comprehend.  Once you get past that, the next obstacle is the blast of vitriol against the United States.  One of the characters, a Japanese doctor (Yoko Tani), will keep mentioning Hiroshima, placed in context with the films overall anti-nuclear message.  Its not a subtle message; its slathered on thick and often, in a condescending fashion that never lets the viewers forget that they, the communists, are the good guys, while we, the Americans, are the evil people who unleashed THE bomb on poor Japan.  Lest we forget, this was an East German production with particular political views.  It is a product of its time and sentiment.  When viewing this film you have to set that aspect aside to get to the good part, when they actually land on Venus.  This is when the film comes alive.  The design of the Venus is like viewing a Richard M. Powers illustration in motion.  It is eerie and fanciful, aided by the brilliant hues used in the design.  Its for this section of the film only that I am keeping this DVD in my collection.  The first part all but put me asleep.  Its not that I mind the message so much as the method of delivery.",1362614400,2,1993,4.563380281690141
7925247,4,B00004WGA2,"I do not think it's very helpful that reviews for ""First Spaceship on Venus"" and ""The Silent Star"" DVD editions are lumped together here. These are, in fact, very different movie experiences. Don't judge ""The Silent Star"" by the movie that was re-created from it under the title ""First Spaceship on Venus"" (shortened, changed background of characters, different music etc.) The original ""Silent Star"" is a real classic with, if you consider its year (1960) and the country of production (the GDR), amazing special effects and set design. It's not a cheap movie, obviously made with great care and thoughtfulness. Nevertheless, it's flawed. There's no denying that some of the acting is rather wooden and not very convincing, and that the story is told in a dry, not very exciting way. Still, the result is an interesting movie. It's based on an early novel by Stanislaw Lem, ""Astronauci"" (The Astronauts) which was, I believe, never translated into English, and fairly faithful as a film adaptation (I read the book some years ago in the German translation). ""The Astronauts"" is a less complex book than later Lem novels, making it better suited for a more ""straightforward"" film adaptation. By the way, the 95 minutes of the ""Silent Star"" DVD edition are the longest version you will ever get - that's the complete original. I don't know where the ""130 minutes"" rumours come from, the movie was never longer than 95 minutes.",1329350400,2,1425,4.941666666666666
