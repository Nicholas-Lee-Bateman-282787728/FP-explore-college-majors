These films give you a good overview of the rich history of the motor city and show you how it became the automobile capital of the world. YOu also get to see a bit of how cars defined the lives of people in the city. All of these films are fairly old, but they are well preserved and give you an interesting sense of how detroit became one of the most important cities in America.",1154131200,,458,4.1

The way that detroit has fallen into economic depression lately makes these otherwise happy films filled with a certain type of meloncholy.

You get to see film after film about how great detroit is doing, how everyone has jobs, how they are making the best cars in teh world and how they were going to make all their residents rich forever.

It's not the detroit I expected to see but it made me realize how quickly fortunes rise and fall.",1146700800,,626,4.522123893805309
