2569573,1,B000FJMZ0O,"Having surfed a couple of times before and not being the absolute natural I was sure I was destined to be, I purchased Andy Iron's DVD. The Chapters profess to cover everything the begineer needs to know, from buying a board to standing, turning and safety. Unfortunately the advice given in the DVD is simple to the point of being patronizing. Iron's advice on equipment involves him going into a surf shop, picking up a board before exclaiming something along the lines of 'this one will do', quickly followed by the narrator pointing out that some of the equipment they're showing you is sponsored by Andy. Iron's coupe de grace is reserved for his explanation of how to stand up on the board, which equates to 'hold the rails, push up and stand up'. If it's that easy andy, why do I need to buy your DVD?",1159833600,6,808,4.503401360544218
2569574,5,B000FJMZ0O,"Great instructional video!  Andy and his sidekick are surprisingly  friendly, funny and perfect for explaining the basics of begining surfing.  Beautifully shot in Hawaii and had me wanting to get in the water immediately.  Good production value. I also like how they incorporate archival footage of Andy as a child in addition to funny skits which make learning to surf less intimidating than some of the other videos I have seen. Definintely worth the $20.",1148256000,,458,5.066666666666666
2569575,3,B000FJMZ0O,"This video could help a beginner with a few useful tips, but I'm not sure any film could replace hands-on instruction. Aside from that, all-in-all, fairly watchable and mildly amusing. Also some nice shots of the Hawai'ian surf.

It opens with a brief recap of Andy's surfing accomplishments before going into the instruction. Frankly, Andy seems a little more comfortable on a surfboard than in front of a camera explaining how to do it. His goofy sidekick does most of the talking and tries a little too hard to be funny, but its ok because you know he's only trying to make it watchable.

They cover really the basics, from standing up on a board for the first time on the sand, to some nice board-mounted (surfboard cam) shots of Andy Irons popups in the water. Not the greatest production quality in terms of video quality, directing, filming, script, etc. -- sometimes it looks like they just set up a cheap video camera and told the guys to talk -- but, nonetheless, I found it funny to watch and you get to see a great surfer's technique in action, albeit on small waves.

As far as instructional value, it depends on your level. If you already surf a lot, it will be rehash. But for someone who hasn't been out before, it certainly couldn't hurt and might provide some useful tips. I did some pausing, slow-mo and rewind of a few critical areas, such the board-cam shots. I even re-watched the section about properly tieing the leash cord to the board.

Like I said, it couldn't hurt for a beginner, although there's no real replacement for a hands-on surfing lesson.",1148169600,2,1576,4.617857142857143
8123652,4,B000FJMZ0O,"This DVD shows exactly what you need to know to get you going. Get a longboard or mini mal, step on it, plant yourself in front of a wave and try to stand up on you board. Oh and if ya fall protect your head ;)
Seriously you can watch this DVD and it really has enough info a beginner needs, all the stuff an instructor tells you, you will forget anyway. Surfing is best learned by doing not by watching DVD's",1324166400,,409,4.0
8123653,1,B000FJMZ0O,"This product is not very informative, poorly produced, and the tiny bit of information given can be found on youtube or other websites. Very disappointed!",1304208000,,154,5.2
8123654,5,B000FJMZ0O,This video is a fun way to be introduced to surfing. Andy and company are funny and make it fun to just watch the dvd,1289347200,,117,3.72
8123655,1,B000FJMZ0O,"This DVD is a joke.  If you want good content, not here.  If you want good production values, not here.  On the other hand, if you want to see Andy Irons stare into the camera for 30 minutes while wearing a hat that shills his own surf company, this is pretty good.  What a waste of space.  He says like three things the whole DVD, and otherwise, it's like he's auditioning to play the role of ""Surfer"" in some 80s movie.  Irons has some sort of sidekick in the movie that does most of the talking (and offers the only real instruction), who is equal parts informative and annoying.  I kindof felt sorry for him as it was clear the producers (or Irons) made him do all kinds of lame stuff to try to add some comedy to the DVD.  Fail.",1283904000,,733,4.148936170212766
8123656,4,B000FJMZ0O,"There are not too many ""learn to surf"" DVD's in the market.  Well, I'll take that back... More like, there are not too many well-produced and cool ""learn to surf"" DVD's in the market.

For the first volume of the ""Learn to Surf: The Fundamentals"" series from Surfwear company Billabong and Transworld SURF magazine comes a cool DVD starring three time world champion Andy Irons and Transworld SURF magazine's Chris Cote in a fun (and short) DVD on pretty much the basic fundamentals.

Join Andy Irons and Chris Cote as they go to a surf shop and show you how to select a surfboard, the accessories you'll need, knowing about safety.  Then you get to watch how to do your stance, standing on the board and learning to paddle.

Then you get to learn how to surf, learning wave physics, attaching a leash, waxing your board and catching waves.

All in all, it's a pretty much self-explanatory DVD that features the basic fundamentals.  What makes the DVD quite entertaining is that Chris Cote clowns around and makes the video fun.

AUDIO AND VIDEO:

Audio is pretty much all dialogue but it can be heard quite well through the speakers.  The video seems to be shot on DV.  Pretty cool cuts cenes of Andy and Chris driving through Hawaii.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Featured is the ""Making of LEARN TO SURF the Fundamentals with 3x World Champion Andy Irons"" and also trailers for five surf films and promo for the Billabong Surf Camp.

The ""Making Of"" is about six minutes long and features the staff involved in the making of the DVD.

Again, this is one of the better, well-produced DVD's on ""Learning to Surf"".  It's a bit short at 30-minutes long but it's pretty much teaching the basic fundamentals and for that, the DVD does its job.

If anything, it's well-done because there are quite a bit of cut scenes, showcasing the beauty of Hawaii and just learning how to surf.  Makes it even more entertaining because of the comedy interaction between Cote and Irons.

All in all, a pretty cool DVD and you can find it for a great price these days online!  Check it out!",1227052800,,2061,4.594520547945206
8123657,5,B000FJMZ0O,I learned to surf from this video. One of the best things about it is watching a world class surfer do basic stuff on easy waves. It's like watching a great pianist play beginners music... you really get how to do it right the first time.,1201737600,2,238,4.195652173913044
8123658,4,B000FJMZ0O,"This is a great dvd for first-timer. If you're already an intermediate surfer, this dvd won't help you.
It's short but Andy tells you everything you need to surf a wave. From equipement selection to beginner turns. And its quit funny too! I was a bit desappointed by the equipement. Andy just does the comparaison between a soft and a normal board and give us a few advices on the accessories.
But still worth buying it!",1198195200,,420,4.5394736842105265
8123659,1,B000FJMZ0O,"This video is so completely devoid of information and/or instruction, that not only did I want my twenty bucks back, but I wanted the half-hour of my life back that I took to watch it.  No joke.  Take ONE surf lesson anywhere, and you will get 50x more out of it.  I'm sure there are other, better video choices out there as well.  This one is really lousy.",1176163200,5,357,4.205882352941177
8123660,1,B000FJMZ0O,"This movie is a joke. I didn't think a human being could possibly be this sub-moronic; but Andy Irons has achieved a new low. If you are so stupid that you can't figure out the difference between the nose and the tail of the board, then this movie is perfect for you. The whole thing is worthless. Andy Irons is obviously a great surfer; you can't argue with that. But as a former world champion, he should be very embarrassed to have his name associated with probably the worst instructional film for any sport ever created.",1168300800,7,525,4.479166666666667
8123661,1,B000FJMZ0O,"hi, im a surfer beginner, i've been for almost a year and i thought this DVD was going to be good,cuz i've heard of andy irons ans stuff, but i found out it was so poor and lame, please don't throw away your money, it shows a couple of useful tips, but about the most important part (standing up) there is this kid i don't know who he is on the explaination instead of been Andy Irons Himself, that was kind of dissapointing ... no big deal this Dvd i think i'll stack it on someplace where it will get dusted ....",1163030400,5,514,4.049019607843137
