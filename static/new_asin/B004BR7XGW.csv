4320428,2,B004BR7XGW,"I couldn't wait to watch this movie after my friends (who had seen it at an Asian-American film festival) raved about it. The trailer makes it look hilarious and smart. Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment for me. Usually with these types of movies about unplanned responsibility (i.e. Knocked Up), it's all fun and games at first, but eventually the characters truly mature, which is the best part of the movie. Not so with this one. Except for maybe one short monologue at the end, the protagonist never really proves herself to be an admirable lead, despite this tremendously huge responsibility she is bringing into the world. I do think the movie really tries to make the characters admirable and ""real,"" but all throughout the movie they and their situations feel unrealistic and contrived. For example, at one point her best friend realizes how much he loves his boyfriend after he cheats on him. Just a few short melodramatic scenes later, the boyfriend forgives him, they get married, and are suddenly completely and perfectly devoted to one another. Think about how many times this actually happens in real life. Uhh, never!! If a person cheats it's FAR more complicated than that! This wouldn't be so bad if there were more laughs, but there aren't. Some of the comedic scenes are decent, but most fall short of being laugh-out-loud funny. Anyway, if you're looking for an indie movie with Asian-American leads that has a lot more heart, I recommend ""Saving Face.""",1304726400,2,1481,4.928
4320429,1,B004BR7XGW,"This was so corny and predictable. People I've slept with? I thought it would be a clever comedy but it turns out to be dry as sandpaper. All the jokes and sexual innuendos are lame with short sighted dialogue which made me cringe even more. I am surprised that Karin Anna Cheung would even participate considering she was in BLT!

The redeeming part was Randall Park is hella funny and he made me want to watch more.",1303948800,3,417,4.415584415584416
4320430,1,B004BR7XGW,"This is an embarrassment to indie and especially Asian American film-making. It is like a huge tasteless, obnoxious, layered cliche cake with cliche frosting and cliche sprinkled on top. What's worse is that these cliches aren't just tacky but offensive as they are often stereotypical of certain groups.

See if you can count the cliches in the plot: It's about a woman who is out to sow her ""wild oats"" and accidentally gets pregnant while doing so and wishes to find out the identity of the baby's father. She keeps a kind of ""score card"" with pics and descriptions of all her bed mates. She has a gay best friend that is very promiscuous and has problems with commitment, a conservative sister with a ""perfect family,"" and an elderly dad with a girlfriend that is her age. The woman finally meets the man of her dreams but he is from a very strict Asian family and associated problems ensue. There are no redeeming qualities to this film; it is as it sounds and nothing more. the jokes are idiotic, unoriginal and obnoxious. It is an exercise in small thinking and pretense for the film makers. Don't encourage them and stay far away.",1303430400,6,1138,4.633663366336633
4320431,5,B004BR7XGW,"I first saw this movie several months ago in the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was blown away by it. This was one of the few movies that has made me both laugh out loud and tear up. The cast of actors was well-chosen, and you can see their synergy throughout the movie. The main character's gay best friend provides a parallel for her own life, and he has some really funny lines in the movie. Archie Kao was attractive as always and makes a great leading man.

All in all, it was fun and interesting seeing all of the lead's sex partners and how she deals with them after finding out she was pregnant.",1302825600,2,617,4.228813559322034
4320432,3,B004BR7XGW,"The People I've Slept With is a pleasant little dramady, no more no less. There is nothing great, or very funny about it. But it didn't put me to sleep. That's something, right? And the actor who played the ""hottie"" was really hot!",1301875200,,231,4.395348837209302
4320433,2,B004BR7XGW,"Im not really sure who the target audience was for this film. Gays? Well if having a gay guy sleep around and make out with every guy walking is what gays are into these days then sure. Females? Well this girl sleeps around (as most girls do) and gets pregnant, gils don't like seeing their life on TV so they won't like this. Guys? Way too manu guy on guy for straight men to enjoy this film. It had some funny moments and the lead acctress is beautiful, but I guess if you have nothing else to watvh this would be ok, but I'd browse around a little longer.",1301270400,3,558,4.128440366972477
4320434,5,B004BR7XGW,"I saw this movie about a year ago at the Asian American Film Festival at the University of California-Davis. The movie is a great laugh and definitely portrays a different side of women, specifically Asian-American women's promiscuity. It's always endearing to see a movie that Asian Americans can relate to. Moreover, it focuses on the protagonist's bisexuality as well as her gay bestfriend's relationship with other men. I definitely recommend this movie if you're looking for a comedy that will make you laugh from beginning until the end. PS. I'm excited that the DVD is finally coming out! I waited for a year for this movie.",1300320000,6,631,4.962264150943396
4320435,5,B004BR7XGW,"If you are looking to watch Terms of Endearment, this is not the movie for you.

However, this movie never takes itself too seriously and examines stereotypes in a thoughtful and non-judgmental way. The characters are well represented factions of society, albeit at times cliched.

A fun light hearted look at a perspective not commonly seen in romantic comedies.

Archie Kao's acting as a romantic lead elevates the quality of the movie, on top of that he looks hot as always :). Karin Anna Cheung shines as the lead actress in search of the baby daddy. Wilson Cruz, her flamboyant gay best friend is hilarious as her ""partner in crime"".

Definitely recommended!",1299369600,6,663,4.892857142857143

4320458,1,B004BR7XGW,"Waste of money ! This is supposed to be a comedy . I DID NOT LAUGH EVEN ONCE ! The premise is you get to see & hear all about the character's sexual experiences -Angela (Karin Anna Cheung ) . It has a very tired old movie clich , pretty girl has a gay male best friend whom she confides in everything to . What you see is some of her sexperiences  & some of Gabriel's (her gay male best friend's) experiences . They should have focused on either hers or his , not both . The title is the people I've slept with not the people we've slept with .",1522800000,2,544,3.900900900900901
4320459,2,B004BR7XGW,"I thought it was too preachy right from the start with the overbearing sister pushing monogamy & marriage. So sick of all these movies preaching that single people who are either promiscious or open relationships are secretly all unhappy. That their love relationships whether they last 20 years or two weeks are less important & less valid than that one magical overpriced piece of paper relationship. Do not get me wrong, I was raised on Disney Cartoons & still love a good monogomous fairy tale of they got married and lived happily ever after, from time to time. I just could not make it past the sisters talking. ** Added to my original one star review** I decided to go back and try to watch the whole movie, though I kept wanting to quit & somehow made it threw the whole movie. I will change my review from 1 star to 2 stars because it did have some funny moments, some nudity and even some decent human emotion aka acting. However even with the growth of Angela and her final decision, I am trying to not give spoilers, I find it still felt like, well, folks, the movie is over and life is complicated. It still felt unfufilling, abrupt and like fluff that you see in other movies. I did think the closing credits music was better than the entire movie though and was basically their main message.",1522627200,,1306,4.491596638655462

4320464,3,B004BR7XGW,"....and (minus) two stars because ""promiscuity"" is complicated in so many ways; it cannot be comical unless you're idotic and very immature.  It is irresponsible and dangerous for all parties involved.  BUT...I remember a young girl telling me, ""I love sex.  I just love it.  I could do it everyday, all day.  I just love sex.""  When asked, ""Well, are you planning to be a prostitute?""  She said, ""No.  Of course not!  I plan on being decent.  Prostitutes accept money for having 'almost' sex.  I like complete sex.  Like you eat and talk together and laugh afterwards.  You look forward to being together again and again.  I don't like being coldhearted to people and a prostitute is coldhearted.  She doesn't care about anyone or anything but money.""
  I can't ever think promiscuity is okay: meaning a cache of 10, 20, 30, 50 sex partners because I have been schooled as to what that REALLY is and oftentimes for the young girl it isn't even an orgasm.  It is just attention!  (''Her body calls for attention because of the Nature inside of it.'')  My mother actually taught me that way back in the 50s.  My mother didn't know anything about ""an orgasm"" back then and she likely never had one but she had a lot of kids and therefore she thought sex would just make Me pregnant a lot.  And she didn't want that to happen to me so she taught me what she knew.  I learned the rest from reading.  AND I WAS MOST AFFECTED when I learned that ""disease spreading"" is a big factor and ""unwanted pregnancy"" is another big factor and then there is the actual baby and person that comes from that pregnancy who is your responsibility forever!  (Serious stuff.)  I ended up thinking and feeling when I was young that this LIFE BUSINESS is no joke. And then there is this:  You as a person and a teenager may not care about who your child's father is but the child will care very deeply about who their father is and why he was not there.  But then, if he is UNWANTED too by the mother...that is most likely why he is not around.  Therefore, some people feel--some women feel--""This is my life and I do what I want...when I want...and with who I want""...but my mother said, ""Don't make your bed hard because you are the one who will have to lie in it.""  INTELLIGENT WISDOM says there is simply no ""gain"" in having promiscuity in your life ever even though the Nature inside of you is calling for it: even so, it simply isn't worth it.  One has to try and ""control"" the Nature within.  And parents ought to teach us how to do that.  THERE ARE NO REDEEMING QUALITIES TO PROMISCUITY  most of the time. The residual harm can last for a whole lifetime and beyond.  SO...I couldn't laugh when I saw this ""cute"" movie because the young American girl is ""cute"" and innocent, but also ignorant of her purpose.  BUT THEN...that's what this movie is.  It's a tool to teach in a clever sort of way--NOW THAT'S PURPOSE. But it does fall short in a big way since she didn't have one boyfriend; she had many--therefore--disease concerns would be among the other issues and problems.  These sort of movies are important for the young girls to try and get their attention and teach them, coax them, help them...albeit, but I never-ever tend to worry about the mother as much as I worry about the child.

The People I've Slept With
2009NR89 minutes
When Angela Yang (Karin Anna Cheung) finds out she's pregnant, she's got countless reasons to be upset about it. But, more specifically, she's concerned because she's slept with so many different guys that she has no idea who the father is. Her more conservative sister (Lynn Chen) makes finding the baby's daddy -- and marrying him -- sound like the only plausible option. But Angela's liberally minded best friend (Wilson Cruz) has other ideas.

4320484,4,B004BR7XGW,"I read many reviews on this movie before I actually watched it. This Asian American movie seemed either a hit or a miss with most people.

After I watched this movie I thought it was a hit. I liked it because it was hilarious to watch. Plenty of good jokes to keep me watching. Most of the jokes would be sexual in nature, but you could had already guessed that from the title of the movie. lol

I thought the story was quiet original and I have never seen this type of movie. I heard about it in real life, but never seen a movie made and finally I found one. Besides the main story line, this movie has a gay love story as well. I'm okay with that because I have many gay friends and I know some of them actually do look for love instead of sex all of the time. This movie was right on when I saw that in the movie.

The only thing I didn't like about the movie was at the end, where you don't actually find out who is the father of her baby. Yes, it pretty obvious, whom the father is and I know that. But, I have an issue with that as well. I'm one of those people that need to actually see or hear it for confirmation. It wouldn't be just this movie too. I hate every movie that does that. It's not so much trouble to just spell it out for the audience and some people would appreciate it the effort.

This movie is 4 out 5 stars and I would recommend it.",1316390400,,1360,3.9525547445255476
4320485,4,B004BR7XGW,"I had to watch this movie twice. Once to watch the movie, which was hilarious. Just the thought of a beautiful American Chinese girl doing the same thing as Caucasian males is funny. But in spite of sleeping around, her character showed strength and integrity. The way she collected DNA samples was really funny. The second time, I just stared at one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen, and thought how wonderful it would be, to wake up every day, looking into her face.

8422278,1,B004BR7XGW,"This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen.  Story, is trite and full of undeveloped, stereotypical characters. Most of the story seems based on the idea that a woman collects trading cards of past lovers; that is not the basis of a movie.  What is the point of this awful movie? The conclusion of the movie seems to be, do whatever you want as long as you're happy? Be prepared to get back stabbed if you're friends with anyone who made this movie. Im sorry, but there are consequences in life, and it is not okay to disregard other people especially when it comes to caring for a child.  Im pretty sure that the star, Karin Anna regrets making this movie.  She is actually quite hot and a decent actor, unfortunately the writing and dialogue are so bad that she is not a likable character in the movie. She had a very promising career after the good movie Better Luck Tomorrow.  It seems like her career took a nose dive after this movie.
