8165674,4,B000M2DMTC,Another worthy DVD in the Scorched Earth Series.  Quite interesting with quality film and narration.  4 stars,1197504000,2,109,5.352941176470588
8165675,3,B000M2DMTC,Some good video footage and an OK commentary but it is a very broad brush overview with too little detail.  The more focussed dvds in the series likely give more relevant and interesting information.,1193875200,2,199,4.852941176470588
8165676,3,B000M2DMTC,"I liked the TANKS! Kursk and Barbarossa series, but this is almost a repeat with the same word for word dialogue in many instances.  I liked the North, South, Center army group films from Scorched Earth series better than this one. Save your money on this one",1177718400,8,259,4.51063829787234
8165677,5,B000M2DMTC,"The film includes the opinions of experts like Robin Clifton, Bob Carruthers and John Erickson but also dramatic footage from actual battles on the Eastern Front, pictures of the horrific carnage produced and many color war-time posters. It gives special emphasis to the gruesome fate of the millions prisoners caught from both sides and the barbarity of the struggle which from the start had a character of extermination rather than simple conquest. Very good film.",1170547200,5,466,5.226666666666667
