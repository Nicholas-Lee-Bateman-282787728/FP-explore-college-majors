8294697,1,B001DSFRT2,Do not buy this.  It is a rip off. The CD started fine but after 10 minutes it stopped playing so I missed the entire Detox,1393977600,,123,3.730769230769231
8294698,5,B001DSFRT2,"I have been using this Detox Drop for over 3 yrs.  I do it every 3-4 months.  Not only does it take away the ""junk"" food cravings that creep in, but I believe it helps keep some of my food allergies at bay.  I have a soy allergy and too much of it causes me to break out in a rash.  Since I have been using this detox....I can consume a moderate amount of soy w/out a problem AND I am taking less medication for it.  Soy is in everything! I should add....I always drop 5-7 pounds when I do it so that is always a bonus!!  All of Robert Ferguson's products and books are well worth it!",1326153600,,584,3.906779661016949
8294699,5,B001DSFRT2,"Detox Drop is an excellent way to start a diet or just to feel better than you ever have before. It was a little challenging when starting due to the toxicants in my system, but by day three I felt like a million bucks. I will continually do Detox Drop for a recharge, or just needing to clean my system from toxicants. I also lose 7 lbs, in three days and did not gain it back.",1291852800,5,378,3.986842105263158
8294700,5,B001DSFRT2,"I have tried many cleansing methods and this one kept its promises and was rewarding to complete. After I finished the first three days, my body craved the following 3 days, so I did the 6 days options. I simply love this cleaning method. I had a lot of energy on the fourth day and felt wonderful.",1273276800,,298,4.245614035087719
8294701,5,B001DSFRT2,"I was looking for a kick-start to a clean and healthy diet.  I got it AND I got a lot more.  For starters, I lost 8 lbs. that stayed off.  More importantly, I truly felt rejuvenated by the entire experience.  I experienced increased energy and, for some reason, enhanced mental focus at work.  The program appears a bit extreme at first, but I found that the novelty of it kept me interested and on track.  Over the six-day course, my body's relationship with food changed.  Upon completion, I felt that I had pressed the ""reset"" button and then easily graduated to eating a clean and healthy diet.  If you do it and find yourself desiring more calories on Day 3, just work through it.  The richer smmoothies and increased solids on days 4-6 make it worthwhile.  Once you are Detox'd, you'll think twice before re-introducing junk into your system. That's why I believe that I am still getting benefits from having done the Detox Drop.",1266451200,10,935,4.612121212121212
8294702,5,B001DSFRT2,"I saw the commercial on TV and thought I'd give it a try.  I felt great for the 6 days, almost sharper at work than ever before.  And I lost 7 pounds.  I thought Robert's lectures on the DVD were very informative.",1264377600,5,213,4.023809523809524
8294703,1,B001DSFRT2,"This was awful. I did not feel well through the whole detox. Also was starved.
I do not recommend unless you do this type of thing all the time.",1262563200,,144,4.0
