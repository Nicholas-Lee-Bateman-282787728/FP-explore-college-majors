6140153,5,B00H83OFMQ,"What I like most about watching on DVD is that I can slow down the game, slow down the plays, even frame by frame, and see where each player comes from, and how he does what he does.",1399939200,,182,3.8157894736842106

* bonus features- trophy presentation
* running time- 171 minutes
* team marketing sports dvds, xos digital
* fullscreen 16:9(thin black bars on top and bottom)

great game, decent dvd.  no major extras but the game seems mostly there.....commentary, replays, crowd noise, multiple shots of katherine webb.  i kid, i kid:)  some awkward edits, but i can live with them if it means no commercials.  dvd quality doesnt look great, but in fairness i was watching on an old 60"" big screen and dvd player.  im sure on a smaller screen with a dvd/bluray upconverter it would look better.  great back and forth game.  recommended.",1396915200,,643,4.87962962962963
6140159,5,B00H83OFMQ,"I was surprised at the high quality of the DVD. In past years reviewers have disdained the video quality of pre-recorded DVD's of sporting events. The quality is close to Blu-ray. Another aspect I liked was the completeness of the broadcast. Unlike the re-broadcast of college football games shown on ESPN, there is no skipping ahead because of ""time constraints"". Every snap of the game was shown. All this without commercials. Fantastic. Speaking of the broadcast, it was the original broadcast of the game with the ESPN broadcast crew. I could not be more pleased with my purchase of the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl DVD. I suppose if I were a Crimson Tide fan I could have found a few faults with the DVD. 5 Stars!",1396828800,,714,4.674603174603175
6140160,5,B00H83OFMQ,Great Game.  Have enjoyed watching it some 5 times since my purchase.  Hats off to Stoops and Team!  What a Win over Alabama!,1396483200,,125,4.3478260869565215
6140161,5,B00H83OFMQ,"Excellent DVD of the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl.  Not perfect - some early game festivities left out.  The entire game and postgame is there, however.",1396137600,,148,4.88
6140162,5,B00H83OFMQ,Stoops stuck it to the SEC with this big win. If you are an Oklahoma fan or even a college football fan you are going to want this as part of your collection. It's weird for OU to be the underdog but no one gave them a chance to win. ESPN analysts even said that if they played a perfect game they had no chance. If you want to see the future of Oklahoma football watch this game.,1395792000,3,380,3.8846153846153846

6140166,5,B00H83OFMQ,"One of the best purchases ever.  I wish I had bought the blu ray version, but the picture is very clear as well and it was great rewatching the glory of beating Saban again and hearing the anouncers just gawk at our team speed.",1394496000,,227,4.159090909090909
6140167,2,B00H83OFMQ,"It's an abridged version of the game.  I'd rather have the whole thing, with all the commentary.  Very disappointed.  Glad I saved it on the DVR.

I have found you can get the full game commercial broadcast direct from the Sugar Bowl online shop; I wish Amazon offered that version rather than this one.",1394409600,8,303,4.555555555555555
