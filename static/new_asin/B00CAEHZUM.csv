8579212,4,B00CAEHZUM,wow i just discovered this while listening to the shock waves podcast and holy cow what a MASTERPIECE!!! this will definitely be added to my christmas season watch list for years to come right next to BLACK CHRISTMAS and KRAMPUS .,1483401600,,230,4.634146341463414
8579213,5,B00CAEHZUM,"The title is really a misnomer. The main character is not ""Evil"" in the slightest. This is less a horror film and more a psychological drama wherein you witness the main character, a Santa Claus fanatic (due to a childhood incident) gradually descend into madness. He's rather quite a nice guy and very generous. But he's mentally ill and easily triggered.

I know a lot of people hate this movie. But if you go in with the idea that you're watching a character study instead of a slasher flick, I feel like you'll enjoy it more.",1482969600,2,529,4.510416666666667
8579214,3,B00CAEHZUM,"This movie can't decide if it wants to be a slasher, or a serious crime drama about a misunderstood monster, underscored by the fact that it ends with an homage to Frankenstein. The kills, when they finally come in at the 50 minute mark, show that it could have been good horror if it had wanted to be.",1480809600,,302,4.224137931034483

Watching Christmas Evil was a joke! Harry's bizarre behavior, his Santa memorabilia, the music, and the movie's trailer were the only scary qualities to Christmas Evil.

I laughed hysterically watching Harry murder 3 church parishioning bullies in front of everyone on the stair steps. This is besides him smothering and slitting his co-workers' throats with a knife. I just couldn't take Christmas Evil seriously.",1451260800,,576,5.042105263157895
