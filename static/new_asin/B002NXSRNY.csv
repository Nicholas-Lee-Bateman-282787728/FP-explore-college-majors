3960525,5,B002NXSRNY,"You can call it the NWA Championship, the WCW Championship, and depending on what show it's on...you can call it the RAW/SmackDown Championship but either way, this belt was always the World Heavyweight Championship.  This presentation is different than any other ""History Of..."" DVD set regarding a championship in that you get a documentary highlighting the history of the championship complete with rare archival footage & facts along with three disc of matches highlighting the championships history through it's top three promotions in NWA, WCW, and WWE.  Throughout the documentary, you'll hear from current WWE talent/employees such as John Cena, Batista, Edge, C.M. Punk, Rey Mysterio, Randy Orton, Triple H, Big Show, Chris Jericho, Ricky Steamboat, Dusty Rhodes, and Jim Ross.  The special treat is that you'll also hear from people that you normally don't hear from (including some archival interviews) like the former NWA President Bob Sigel, Bill Watts, Mae Young, Larry Hennig, Jim Crockett, Lou Thesz, Jack Brisco, Mike Chapman who is the head of the International Wrestling Institute & Museum, Verne Gagne, Fabulous Moolah, Bobby Heenan, Gene Kiniski, Cheif Jay Strongbow, Dory & Terry Funk, Mike Graham, Goldberg, Jim Cornette, Eric Bischoff, Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, Ron Simmons, and of course Ric Flair.

The documentary starts off talking about how far back wrestling goes to the point where it's mentioned in the Bible to former U.S. President Abe Lincoln was once a wrestler to the first World Champion in Frank Hackenschmidt.  ""The American Hero"" Frank Gotch was talked about next including stories about how he would wrestle for over 2 hours & was the man who inspired wrestling to be taught in high schools & YMCA's.  The championship reign of Ed ""The Strangler"" Lewis was highlighted by stories of how he was a celebrity in the 1920's and even once wrestled a match that went over 5 hours long (yes, 5 hours...300+ minutes!) that resulted in referees passing out, no audience by the time the match was over, him in the hospital for two days, and how that started to change the perspective of wrestling at that time into what we would know today as ""sports entertainment"".  The story behind the formation of the National Wrestling Alliance was discussed before going into the great Lou Thesz' record long NWA Championship reign, how he carried himself as a champion, and just how much of a celebrity he was.  Buddy Rogers, the original ""Nature Boy"", and how he set a record for his title victory & what he brought to wrestling that changed the image of what a World Champion was is talked about before discussing the next series of champions & stories about their championship reigns like Gene Kiniski with a funny story of how he lost the championship, the tough Harley Race, Jack Brisco becoming the first Native American NWA Champion & the heavy toll being the champion took on him, and the only brothers to hold the championship in Dory Jr. & Terry Funk.  How Starrcade '83 marked a new era in the history of the NWA with Ric Flair becoming champion was discussed next talking about how Flair was in high demand everywhere &  his feuds with Dusty Rhodes & Ricky Steamboat before going into the story behind how Jim Crockett Promotions going bankrupt led to Ric Flair showing up on WWE TV with the championship.  From there, the talk goes into the various champions during WCW's history such as Ron Simmons being the first African American champion, the big & agile Vader (listen to Jericho's comments about Vader), and WCW's posterboy in Sting.  How the Monday Night War with WWE caused the WCW Championship to have more frequent changes with some being more dubious than others (Vince Russo, David Arquette, Sid Vicious, Jeff Jarrett) before discussing various WCW Champions during that time like Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Giant winning the title in his first match, how Diamond Dallas Page felt like he was winning the Oscar, Goldberg, and Booker T closing out the company as champion.  The story behind the WCW Championship coming to WWE and later being unified into the Undisputed WWE Championship is discussed before closing out the documentary talking about Eric Bischoff bringing the World Heavyweight Championship back and highlighting the various champions in the WWE era such as Randy Orton being the youngest champion, Mysterio being the smallest, C.M. Punk, Edge, Batista, Undertaker, and John Cena.

Matches Include:
NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Magnum T.A. - This was a very competitive match that went back & forth between both men with Magnum overpowering & out-wrestilng Flair early before Flair regained the advantage & heavily worked over his arm.  Flair ended up bleeding at one point before just squeaking past Magnum.
AWA SuperClash '85

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - This was the big return of Sting after his leg injury early in the year looking for revenge against the man who kicked him out of the Horsemen & had him get injured later that night.  To insure a fair fight, Sting's group of friends called ""Dudes With Attitudes"" surrounded the ring to ensure the Horsemen wouldn't interfere while Ole Anderson was handcuffed on the ramp way to El Gigante.  Sting took the fight right to Flair & dominated him in the early going showing no signs of ring rust.  Although Flair heavily targeted his knee, Sting kept coming back & fighting off Flair's attack before Sting won his first ever World Championship.
NWA Great American Bash '91
[Bonus match on ""WWE Great American Bash '06""]

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Scott Steiner - Over seven years before he became a full time singles wrestler under the name ""Big Poppa Pump"", Scott Steiner got a one on one match here against the Nature Boy & seriously didn't look out of place one time although he was a full time tag team wrestler with Rick, who was at ringside, at this time.  Steiner kept using his superior power against Flair and went the distance here against the champion in this heavily impressive performance.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions"" Jan. '91

WCW Championship Match: Lex Luger vs. Barry Windham - This was one of the most famous matches in the history of the World Heavyweight Championship...for all the wrong reasons.  This match was to determine the new WCW Champion after Ric Flair left the company a short time earlier and the crowd didn't approve of this as they kept chanting throughout this match ""We Want Flair!""  There was tons of stalling between both men during the first half of the match and never left first gear until the end with Luger doing unfamiliar moves like the DDT & a sleeper while both men tried to come off the top rope at one point.  In the end, Luger left with not only the World Championship but also a new unexpected manager & bodyguard.
WCW Great American Bash '91

WCW Champion Vader vs. Ron Simmons - The story behind this match was that this was originally suppose to be Sting's rematch against Vader from the ""Great American Bash"" but after Sting was attacked by Jake Roberts earlier in the evening, Ron Simmons got the title shot.  Simmons in this match was defined perfectly by Jim Ross, ""going off power & determination.""  He went power for power against Vader resulting in the first ever African American World Heavyweight Champion.
Aug. '92

Human Cage Match: WCW Champion Vader vs. Ricky Steamboat - Although this match was given a fancy name, it's really just a lumberjack match.  Steamboat & Vader's different styles clashed her as Vader used his power & weight while Steamboat heavily relied on his martial arts chops & kicks along with various splashes onto Vader's ribs.  This was a really average match that wasn't bad but nothing I would honestly consider DVD worthy when showcasing the history of this championship.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Oct. '93

Steel Cage Match: WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair - This was the third match in their series as Hogan won at Bash At The Beach while Flair won the rematch at ""Clash Of The Champions"" by count out so to ensure this was the final match, this was also a career ending match for the loser.  Mr. T was the referee while celebrities like Muhammed Ali & Tommy ""Hitman"" Herns were at ringside along with Sting.  Flair worked over Hogan's bad leg while Hogan came off very aggressive to the point where T had to keep acknowledging Hogan to back off which kept causing conflict between those two men.  This got real wild in the end with Sherri, Sting, Jimmy Hart, a masked man, and handcuffs all got involved in the match before Hogan overcame the odds to retain the championship.  As a side note, the part where the masked man was revealed to be Brutus Beefcake is not shown here.
WCW Halloween Havoc '94

WCW Championship Match: Sting vs. Hollywood Hogan - After the controversial ending of the more famous Starrcade match between these two and the rematch they had the next night on Nitro, this was the match to determine the vacant WCW Champion with the rules heavily relaxed as this was set to be one fall to a finish.  This was a very aggressive fight as Hogan was cheating (including using his weight belt as a weapon) & kept bad mouthing Sting before Sting came back & got his receipts with the weight belt.  As expected, the nWo members did make an appearance but it was one specific member who would be the difference maker in this match helping WCW gain their championship back & had their own spray painted celebration.
WCW SuperBrawl VII

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg - This was more about putting Goldberg over as WCW's ""superhero"" & top star more than anything else as Hogan threw everything he could at Goldberg by either wrestling him & resorting to cheating only for Goldberg to not be effected by it & keep coming back dominating his way to the WCW Championship. With cameos from Dallas Page, Karl Malone, and Curt Hennig...this wasn't much as far as a ""match"" goes but this was all about making Goldberg the top superstar in WCW.
""WCW Nitro"" July '98
[Monday Night War]

WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T - This was similar to the Luger/Windham match in that this match was infamous for all the wrong reasons.  It was originally scheduled to be Hollywood Hogan vs. Jeff Jarrett but Jarrett laid down at Vince Russo's request so Hogan could win the WCW Championship before Russo came back out later to fire Hogan, claim Jarrett to still be the World Champion, and awarded the title shot to Booker T...who already had a match (and lost) against Kanyon earlier that night too.  This was your stereotypical Jarrett match in that it had a brawl through the crowd & ringside area including Booker taking a piledriver on the announce table that didn't give one bit.  From there, it was back & forth between both men before Jarrett's efforts with the ""acoustic equalizer"" didn't work out for Booker T to become the new WCW Champion.
WCW Bash At The Beach '00

WCW Champion The Rock vs. Chris Jericho - This match happened during the period when WWE had brought WCW and the WCW Championship was defended on WWE television.  The big story behind this one was the fact that Chris Jericho had never won ""the big one"" as every single time he had a chance at a World Championship, something went wrong & he didn't win it.  Both Rock & Jericho were fan favorites at this time so the crowd was heavily split between both men.  This was a very physical match-up as it never once got boring or slow between both men as it started out as a wrestling match but got more personal as the match went on with both men countering each other's signature moves along with The Rock delivering a Rock Bottom through a table while Jericho was stealing moves like the Rock Bottom & People's Elbow.  Stephanie McMahon made an appearance & accidentally assisted Jericho to use whatever ""stroke"" he had left to finally become a World Champion.
No Mercy '01

World Champion Triple H vs. Rob Van Dam - This was the first PPV title defense of the World Championship after Triple H was awarded the new championship on RAW.  A good match between the two as RVD continued to mock HHH to everyone's delight but the ending came when Ric Flair (who HHH insulted before the match for losing earlier) hit RVD with the sledgehammer starting Flair & HHH's on-screen partnership.
Unforgiven '02

World Champion Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels - You can look at any encounter they've had in the past & just know that whenever you get these two in the ring against each other, you will get a high quality match.  However, this is one match they've had that stood out from the rest as the circumstance were completely different than any other match they've had as Shawn Michaels came into this match with a knee injury he suffered on RAW the night before so Shawn wrestled a heavy defensive style here as he was heavily limping from the moment he walked out during his entrance.  Shawn kept staying in the corner and using the ropes to help him get around whenever he wasn't limping on hopping on one leg while Triple H heavily targeted that knee and worked on it with moves like the figure four.  Shawn was still able to connect with his top rope elbow drop & sweet chin music but with the appearances of fellow Evolution member Batista along with Edge, the odds were just too much for HBK.
Taboo Tuesday '04

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Undertaker - Both men started off at a fast pace with Undertaker targeting an area of the body with different stretches & strikes from dropping all of his weight into different submissions with regular & his trademark offense focused directly on that area while Angle took advantage of an opening targeting another area of the body using similar tactics that was done to him along with taking advantage of his surroundings in & outside of the ring as both men went back & forth throughout the contest trading reversals & counters getting more physical as the match went on to the point where one man wasn't willing to take a ""cheap win"" to prove he was truly the better man in what was nothing short but a true ""lost classic"" that saw both men give everything they had as had beat each other into exhaustion.
No Way Out '06

World Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton - Unfortunately due to having the label of being the ""smallest"" World Champion of all time, Mysterio was booked as an underdog losing to bigger competitors a majority of his title reign...in fact, you can count the number of matches he won on one hand.  However this is a lost gem in his championship reign as this match happened the week after he won the title at WrestleMania.  Unlike how his WrestleMania triple threat match was real short, this went twice as long & was much more competitive between the two men and any other match they've had before this as Rey was out for revenge for the disrespect Orton showed the late Eddie Guerrero.  I wouldn't call his a lost classic in the career of Mysterio but this was definitely the best match in his reign as World Champion.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '06

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker vs. Edge - Edge played up his ""ultimate opportunist"" label as he was avoiding Taker at the start, running away when Taker & Batista were fighting over who gets their hands on Edge, and trying to steal the pin after Taker legdropped Batista on the apron. The match never got slow & as just nonstop action the entire time with the ending involving Edge ""having the strength of 3 men"" was something. Edge stole another World Championship in the end.
Armageddon '07

World Champion Chris Jericho vs. John Cena - After what I thought was a real good series of matches between each other in 2005 (Vengeance with Christian, SummerSlam, and their final match on RAW), this one was another disappointment as Cena had some ring rust here that showed here while Jericho targeted his previous injury & focused on the neck. The match wasn't bad but they would put on a better performance at Armageddon the next month but it didn't live up to the expectations based off their series years earlier.
Survivor Series '09

Ladder Match: World Champion Edge vs. Jeff Hardy - I'll give credit in that they've tried to do what Jericho/Michaels did at No Mercy in delivering a different type of ladder match than the usual ""non-stop spotfest"" that we're used to seeing. They tried to find new ways to use the ladder in this match along with revisiting old ""highlight reel"" spots from all their previous ladder matches. Again, it was a good match but it wasn't the blow away classic everyone was expecting...but to be fair, they've set the bar so high for the past decade in regards to ladder matches that they just couldn't top it in this case. This was one of those matches where if you judge it on it's own instead of comparing it to all of their past ladder matches (I counted at least six) then it's a good match. But the major story at the end of the night was the aftermath that resulted in a new World Champion...AGAIN!
Extreme Rules '09

Other matches include Pat O'Connor vs. Buddy Rogers from 1961 in a 2 out of 3 falls match, (I think the oldest match WWE ever released on DVD to the point where it's completely in black & white) and matches from the ""NWA Championship Wrestling from Flordia"" promotion featuring Dory Funk Jr.'s NWA Title win against Gene Kiniski, Terry Funk's gaining the title from Jack Brisco, and Dusty Rhodes title victory over Harley Race.  It should be noted that the CWF footage was edited back then to just show highlights/final moments of matches & not the complete match so that's not WWE's fault that you don't get the match in full.

In all, this documentary is one of the best WWE has ever done as they focused heavily & dedicated most of the time on here to the past history of the championship in the NWA/WCW than WWE with the gem of the historic photos, archival footage, and hearing from various names of the past that we don't normally hear from and although they rewrote some history to simplify the history of the championship (no mention of the period when the title was the NWA Championship & WCW International Championship from '92-'94), it was probably for the better.  While The match selection isn't 100% perfect (only 3 complete matches highlight the NWA period, Steamboat/Vader could have been replaced by another WCW match, I would have picked the Cena/Jericho from Armageddon than S. Series), a majority of the matches were quality in either being historic or in quality so this is definitely a set worth going out of your say to see.  I highly recommend.",1262390400,11,18534,4.706736711990112
3960526,4,B002NXSRNY,"The History of the World Heavyweight Titles gives us some really good moments/matches, but also has some questionable additions.  I'll get to my reviews with some final thoughts in the end.

Documentary:
The doc part of this DVD ended up being much more informative and interesting than I anticipated.  I have a hard time getting into anything in wrestling pre-1980, but this doc was really good.  It goes into good depth covering world champions from around 1905 up through the mid 1980's.  It talks about key matches and the personalities.  It was a really good doc that kept me much more entertained than I thought it would have.

Matches:
I only reviewed the matches from the 80's on, because like I said, I just have  no interest in anything pre-1980.

SuperClash 1985
Ric Flair vs Magnum TA
I was not impressed with this one at all.  I was hoping for much better from these two.  The crowd did not seem to care to even try to be into this match and the wrestlers seemed to be feeling the same way.  This match drags on for 30 minutes and never really finds its groove.  5/10

Great American Bash 1990
Ric Flair vs Sting
This was one of the few ""all time classic/talked about matches"" that had managed to evade me over the years.  Every expectation I had was exceeded.  I loved this match top to bottom.  It is 16 minutes of Ric and Sting going all out, cutting a great pace, for a great match.  Great performances here by both men.  Crowd is wild hot for the whole event.  I can easily say this one is now in my top 5 favorite matches.  I don't like giving matches perfect ratings, because I feel like people do not take it seriously, but this one gets a perfect rating.  10/10

Clash of the Champions 1991
Ric Flair vs Scott Steiner
I'm a big fan of Flair and anything early 90's from the Steiners.  This one was a good showing, could have been better though.  It runs for about 30 minutes.  Ric shows up for a good performance here, but Scott did not really pull off one of those great performances that used make me love him.  The final 5 minutes become pretty annoying the way Scott continues to play to the crowd also.  The match is okay.  The wrestlers seemed to have trouble meshing at moments, they obviously did not wrestle each other much throughout their careers.  6.5/10

Great American Bash 1991
Cage Match
Lex Luger vs Barry Windham
This one really took me by surprise and I think it took the crowd by surprise too.  From the opening bell the crowd was chanting ""We want Flair""!  But by the 5 minutes mark they are hooked into this match.  Barry Windham has a great performance here, I had forgotten what a good wrestler he was.  Lex Luger has a really good match himself here, pulling a few new moves we had not seen from him before.  It's a great back and forth contest.  The cage doesn't come into play really at all.  It seems to only be there to keep people out/keep people in.  I think that added to the match in a very positive way though.  Good pace here also, no rest holds.  8.5/10

Baltimore, MD 1992
Vader vs Ron Simmons
This one, like the one above, turned about to be surprisingly good!  The crowd took to Ron from the opening bell, he really went hard from the first minute of the match.  Vader was mean and stiff as usual.  It was kept at a good length, allowing these big men to go hard and fast without draining the match.  7.5/10

WCW Saturday Night 1993
""Human Cage Match"" (Lumberjack Match)
Vader vs Ricky Steamboat
Disappointment here.  All the great stuff we have seen from Steamboat and Vader from this time period, I was thinking this would be classic.  It wasn't.  Steamboat and Vader did not seem to be on the same page at all.  It is terribly slow and terribly long.  Vader dominates most of the match and the ending is pretty anticlimactic.  I may be being a little hard on it, but 4/10

Halloween Havoc 1994
Cage Match
Ric Flair vs Hulk Hogan
This may have been just about the best Hogan vs Flair encounter I've ever seen.  The first half is a great old school cage match.  It's a great combo of wrestling, cage involvment, storytelling, and a crowd that was eating it all up.  The second half of the match turns into a bit of cluster of different outside interference.  The interference definitely takes away from how great the match was going, but it still keeps you very entertained, despite not being a wrestling classic.  Very enjoyable match.  7.5/10

SuperBrawl VIII 1998
Sting vs Hulk Hogan
This was pretty similiar to every WCW pay per view main event from 97, 98, 99.  Two veterans, fighting for the world title, with a WCW vs nWo storyline.  The end result is a match that is just okay.  It's not wrestling classic, but for what it's worth, it's entertaining enough.  6.5/10

Nitro 1998
Goldberg vs Hulk Hogan
Probably the hottest crowd in WCW history.  They are wild the whole match.  I remember watching this one like it was yesterday, glued to my TV.  Like the match above, its no wrestling classic, but the entertainment value is through the roof high.  Hogan makes Goldberg look great and Goldberg was just about at his best here.  You can't help but love the last 2 minutes of the match.  7.5/10

Bash at the Beach 2000
Booker T vs Jeff Jarrett
This match is pretty good.  It's definitely above par.  I really enjoyed their match the next month from New Blood Rising alot more.  I guess they put this one here to show Booker's first title win.  The WCW announcing from this period is laughable.  The crowd is surprisingly more into this one than I would have thought, considering it was a surprise match.  Nice little match here.  6.5/10

No Mercy 2001
The Rock vs Chris Jericho
This is a mixed bag here.  I had trouble making myself watch this one.  I just saw Jericho and Rock wrestler so many times in late 2001/early 2002.  There matches were always the same.  They were pretty good, but pretty similiar, and pretty predictable.  This one runs about 24 minutes.  The first 15 are pretty mundane and lost me a few times.  The last 10 pick up for a good match finish.  The surprise ending helps this one also.  6.5/10

Unforgiven 2002
Triple H vs Rob Van Dam
I'm not sure why this one was placed on this DVD set.  I remember not being real crazy about it in 02.  Rewatching it definitely did not change my opinion.  Very similiar to any okay RAW main event we have ever seen.  Not a good pace and not really a good match.  5/10

Taboo Tuesday 2004
Triple H vs Shawn Michaels
Why?  Why would they put this on here?  I don't understand it.  Shawn and HHH have had so many better matches than this one.  This is really not good at all.  Triple H dominates the whole match in slow, cerebral fashion.  Almost takes the form of a glorified squash match.  4/10

No Way Out 2006
Kurt Angle vs Undertaker
I had read so many reviews on this match, praising it for its excellence, I was very anxious to finally see this one.  This truly is a really good match.  The firt 15 minutes are a good build up of classic, pure wrestling.  The final 15 minutes are a great, edge of your seat contest.  You can definitely tell the change in pace before and after the table spot.  8/10

Smackdown 2006
Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton
Don't let the fact that it was on Smackdown fool you, this was a PPV quality main event.  Reminiscent of Edge vs Rey from Royal Rumble 2009.  Rey goes all out for this fast paced, but still great match.  Randy puts on a great performance to make Rey look like a credible champion early in his reign.  8/10

Armageddon 2007
Edge vs Batista vs Undertaker
This was a strange match.  Edge does alot of hit and runs, leaving Batista and Undertaker to battle.  The Batista and Undertaker battles are definitely not of Wrestlemania 23 quality, but the result it par.  Edge pulls some strange tactics, which confuses the crowd, not helping the match.  Runs about 11 minutes.  Could have been better if given more time and more ability to let them go all out.  7/10

Survivor Series 2008
Chris Jericho vs John Cena
Cena's return match turned out to be a fun one.  Once Cena gets over his ""I'm scared"" mentality in this match, it goes better.  Match was definitely an improvement over their 2005 stuff.  Fun and good is what I can use to describe this one.  7/10

Extreme Rules 2009
Ladder Match
Jeff Hardy vs Edge
Great match here.  Alot of times WWE ladder matches tend to get repetitive and stale, this one rises way above that though.  I enjoyed this one more than the TLC match at Summerslam 2009.  Good pace, great spots, new stuff, and great effort from both men.  This also includes the post match-match with CM Punk vs Jeff Hardy.  9/10

Final Thoughts:
There are some truly great matches on here that really deserve a spot on this DVD. (Sting vs Flair, Edge vs Jeff Hardy)  Others that are not classics, have that entertaining factor that make them worthy of being here.  (Hogan vs Flair)  But there are a few matches on here that could have EASILY be replaced by great matches that did not make the DVD.  I just don't understand why some of them are here.  None the less, the matches that are great make the DVD worth buying.",1261267200,,9103,4.423472474289171
3960527,3,B002NXSRNY,"...but the video preview here on Amazon doesn't give me much confidence for it'a accuracy. They say that the card at Comiskey Park had an attendance record that stood until 1987 with Wrestlemania III, however I can confirm that the WCCW David Von Erich Parade of Champions in 1984 and the 1986 Big Event in Toronto drew more prior to Wrestlemania. So it's hard to have confidence on this documentary when they can't even get the facts straight.",1260921600,,444,4.705128205128205
3960528,4,B002NXSRNY,"I think this dvd covers the history of wrestling in the United States and the world heavyweight championship quite well but it does have its short-comings. I wouldn't say the documentary was biased in the same way Monday Night War or WCW dvds were but it did omit a number of not-so-pleasant issues and times in history.
Hang on, this is going to be a long review.

Documentary

The documentary starts off with the history or origins of wrestling, even quoting the Bible. The first so-called world champion was, as everyone is aware of, George Hackenschmidt from Estonia. However, the documentary allocates more time on Frank Gotch, the American Hero. It does not mention that fact that in the 1908 match between Hackenschmidt and Gotch, Gotch was accused of putting on body oil and that right before the 1911 rematch, Gotch paid Hackenschmidt's sparring partner 5,000 dollars to injure Hackenschmidt. This led to the downfall of wrestling in the 1910s.
The documentary moves onto Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher whose 1916 match lasted for 5 hours, only to be stopped by the 5th referee. Then, it takes a leap to the 1948 National Wrestling Alliance, omitting the Goldust Trio in the 1930s who brought the rise and fall of wrestling in the '20s and '30s.
I could understand how the National Wrestling Association was not mentioned at all.
Then again, it leave the '50s and '60's out where Thesz left NWA which led to the breaking up NWA into the original NWA, WWA, Boston, Ohama and AWA. Obviously, it does not address the relationship between the current WWE and NWA of how they kept switching from being separated to being merged.
For obvious reasons, the fact that Giant Bubba is a three-time NWA champion by puchasing it, yes he paid the NWA, from the NWA for a week at a time is not mentioned at all.
The documentary covers the period of Jim Crockett Promotion and WCW well but much of it was covered in WCW, Monday Night War, Ric Flair dvds.

Matches

*Chicago 1961 - 2 out of 3 Falls: Pat O'Connor vs. Buddy Rogers
The only black and white, and 2 out of 3 falls match in the dvd. It's a treasure. To my knowledge, this is the first time any match of O'Conor or Rogers has been released by WWE.

*Florida 2/11/69 - Gene Kiniski vs. Dory Funk Jr.
A historic match except this had been edited to 3 minutes. I don't know whether the 3 minutes was all WWE had or it had been hacked intentionally.

*Florida 12/10/75 - Jack Brisco vs. Terry Funk
Another historic match except the match picks up from the 20 minute mark, leaving us with only 8 minutes. Again, I have no idea whether this had been intentional.

*Florida 8/21/79 - Harley Race vs. Dusty Rhodes
As much as Rhodes was extremely popular in Florida, he was nothing more than a transitional champion on every occasion. Rhodes won his first championship here but lost it back to Race only 5 days later. His other two reigns lasted only 88 and 14 days respectively. Rhodes does deserve all the credit in the world, but his ring ability was no where near that of Race or Flair who were simply better suited for the job as the NWA champion who had to wrestle a different wrestler every day.
Again, this match had been 'edited' (was this all they had?) to only 4 minutes with Rhodes doing his own commentary.

*AWA SuperClash - Ric Flair vs. Magnum TA
This was a standard match. I guess SuperClash does have its place in history as 'the last dying efforts of dying organizations' but nothing more.

*Great American Bash '90 - Ric Flair vs. Sting
This was supposed to be 'passing of the torch' but Sting could not replace Flair in the same way Ultimate Warrior could not replace Hogan in 1990. Notice the similar timings of 1990 WrestleMania and Great American Bash where the so-called passing of the torch took place in two orginazations?

I would have preferred to see more NWA matches including the Thesz matches. The 1963 match between Thesz and Rogers was where the famous expression 'We could do this the easy way or the hard way' came into existence. Rogers could not outwrestle 47-year-old Thesz.

Disc 2 - WCW

*Clash of Champions XIV - Ric Flair vs. Scott Steiner
Again another standard match. The only thing this match is worth watch for is that Steiner could actually wrestle then. I hated his matches after he develeoped the 'largest forearms in the world'.

*Great American Bash '91 - Lex Luger vs. Barry Windham
All this match symbolized was that the crowd wanted Flair. The match was terrible and people kept chanting 'We want Flair!'.

*Baltimore 8/2/92 - Vader vs. Ron Simmons
A meaningful match as Simmons became the first African-American wrestler to become the world champion, paving the way for Booker T, the Rock and many more.

*WCW SaturdayNight 10/16/93 - Vader vs. Ricky Steamboat
This was a squash match as Steamboat had to make the Vader look like an invicinble monster.

*Halloween Havoc '94 - Career vs. Career Steel Cage Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair
This was much better than their Bash at the Beach match. But, really I am tired of 'career' matches when they come back within a year every time after healing their injuries.

*SuperBrawl VIII - Sting vs. Hollywood Hogan
This was Sting's second championship win over Hogan. Sting worked his butt off to work with Hogan but with Hogan, it's always difficult.

*Nitro 7/6/98 - Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg
The only match that had been previously released. I liked this version much more than the Monday Night War dvd version since this one had the long entrance and exit included.

*Bash at the Beach '00 - Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T
The documentary called Jarrett and Russo dubious champions but then why include a Jarrett match? I suppoed the Bash at the Beach 2000 does have its own historical importance as Jarrett laid down for Hogan (a work), then Russo fired Hogan immediately (a shoot, according to Hogan and Bischoff). If they put this one for that historic significance, then why not put in that segment as well?

*No Mercy '01 - The Rock vs. Chris Jericho
You could audibly hear that the crowd was divided. The Rock is much better as a heel and people preferred it that way.

Disc 3 - WWE
*Unforgiven '02 - Triple H vs. Rob Van Dam
Triple H was so dominant during this era but really, did RVD deserve to wait another 4 years to become a world champion?

*Taboo Tuesday '04 - Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
The injured leg of Michaels angle took away the wrestling out of the match. Did they choose this one because all the other post-2002 Triple H/Michaels matches had been released on other dvds?

*No Way Out '06 - Kurt Angle vs. The Undertaker
The best match of disc 3. Angle wanted to wrestle the Undertaker at WrestleMania since WrestleMania 20 and I could see why. This match should have been the main event at WrestleMania 22 instead of Angle/Orton/Mysterio match (we all knew Mysterio was going to pin Orton to win) or Cena/Triple H match (Am I the only one who is tired of Cena/Triple H feud where no good wrestling match ever comes out of?).

*SmackDown 4/7/06 - Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton
Any match of Benoit as the champion would have been better but since they decided to treat Benoit as if he never existed, they replaced it with this regular TV material match.

*Armageddon '07 - Batista vs. Undertaker vs. Edge
All previous encounters of Batista vs. Undertaker outshined this one by a large margin. Then of course, most of them had been released on other dvds, so they had to settle for the worst. I like Edge as the ultimate opportunist angle but this one ruined the match.

*Survivor Series '08 - John Cena vs. Chris Jericho
A rare time where I give any credit to Cena for his wrestling ability. Then, Jericho deserved more credit for bringing that out of Cena.

*Extreme Rules '09 - Ladder Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Edge
I guess Hardy and Edge wanted to show the audience something different from their previous matches as tag teams. Nice efforts but not quite.

Overall, I would have loved to see more old NWA matches. I know they are just sleeping there inside the WWE library and I have no idea what they are going do with them, or even have any plans of using them at all. I noticed they plan to relased a dvd on Johnny Nitro and the Shawn Michaels' 25 Greatest Matches. How about the Best 25 NWA matches before 1988?",1260748800,3,8276,4.573648648648649
3960529,5,B002NXSRNY,"I was quite surprised at how excellent the documentary part of this DVD was. It really goes in depth to the creation of the NWA and the progress of the World title though the years. Lots of the old-timers are put over: Thesz, Rogers, the Funks, Race and more, stunning to see a WWE DVD highlight non-WWE stuff as so fantastic. They also delve into WCW pulling out of the NWA and how the belt fell out of favor due to the constant title switches of the late-'90's. But they still put over Flair, Dusty, Vader, Ron Simmons and more and you get the wide respect everyone has for the lineage of the belt. The matches are a good selection with some stuff long overdue for DVD (Hogan vs Flair from Halloween Havoc '94, Flair vs Vader and much more. This is a terrific addition to any wrestling fan's library, a showcase of how wrestling history was much older than WWE and nice of them to ackowledge that.",1260662400,6,899,4.357142857142857
3960530,2,B002NXSRNY,"Even though this isn't a review, I was disappointed in the matches there were chosen for this. Since this is classified as a ""history of,"" I wasn't sure if this covered the whole world championship which came into being in the early 1900's, or the one we've come to know when WCW first introduced it in the early '90's. I'm disappointed because there isn't enough old matches, and the matches they do have, a number of them have been recycled, especially in recent years. For instance, the Hogan/Goldberg match is on the Monday Night Wars dvd. Speaking of Hogan, no offense towards him, but why are 3 of disc 2's 9 matches have him in it? Aren't there any other matches they could put in? Also, the Sting/Hollywood Hogan match on disc 2 was in Hogan's set. There are also 2 Vader matches on disc 2. No offense to him, but was he a dominant world champion to warrant to matches on this collection? I think not. When it comes to Ric Flair, a former 16x World Champion, he only appears in 2 matches on this set, the latter is with Hogan. The second disc appears to be matches from WCW in the '90's and turn of the century, but I feel they could have had better matches than that on here. Disc one's documentary on the world championship looks good, but why does this ""history of..."" set have a documentary pertaining to this particular belt when the ""history of the WWE Championship"" and ""h.o.t. Intercontinental Belt"" are lacking it? The few matches on disc one, to me, look like gems, and am saddened that there are more of these matches. With all the matches that WWE has hidden away in their vault, I'm surprised they didn't pull out more ""older"" matches than that. Overall, I'm disappointed in the level of matches that this collection has to showcase this prestigious, old, and respected belt. I think WWE could have selected matches that would have done this belt, and the buisness, justice. Even though I'm going to be a hypocrite and purchase this when it goes on sale, I'm still am going to be disappointed and probably won't watch the matches. I'm mainly buying it for the documentary. Having older matches, particularly ones that pre-date the 1980's, would have been a real gold mine, I believe. I hope this set proves me wrong.",1260403200,2,2237,4.567164179104478

3960536,4,B002NXSRNY,"The documentary was excellent.  It won't make you an expert in the history of the title.  But, it does give the highlights.

The matches are all well executed and entertaining.

Wrestling fans will definitely get their money's worth and more.  So, I'd definitely rank this one a ""buy""

So, why only 4 stars?

I got two words for ya, ""Match Selection""!  Most of the matches are historic title changes.  A couple are outstanding title defenses.  But, some just don't have a reason to be there.  Don't get me wrong, they're good matches.  But, matches in which the champ retains the title via screwjob or the time limit expriring just aren't historical enough.  This is especially frustrating when you consider the fact that they didn't simply run out of good stuff and add some filler. There are plenty of historic matches missing.

The documentary spends several minutes explaining what a major figure Lou Thesz was in the early TV era.  They also discuss who much he was on TV.  So, why not include even one of his major matches?

Where is Kerry Von Erich's tile victory over Ric Flair? I could go on.  But, you get the point.

Hopefully, there will be a Part 2 that will include these matches.

Don't let that one complaint steer you away from this collection tho.  You will get several hours of great wrestling action at a very reasonable price.  Buy it.",1403395200,,1356,4.632911392405063

The documentary on the history of the world title is more like a history of wrestling which isn't bad to watch honestly, but the world championship is more talked about in the last 10 minutes of the documentary.

The match selection was also not the best. It does have a couple of great matches that some people may have forgotten along the way. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle at No Way Out (which they were actually trying to get for Wrestlemania 22) was great and John Cena vs. Chris Jericho at Survivor Series 2008, a few good matches, but not enough to get the dvd.

3960551,5,B002NXSRNY,"Trailing the lineage of something that dates back over 100 years seems like quite the daunting task, but that doesn't stop WWE from putting together a documentary about the history of the world championship.

This doc. tells the story from the early 1900's when a russian named George Hackenschmidt was so dominate he was named the world wrestling champion and remained unbeaten until amercian Frank Gotch defeated him via an ankle lock submission. Gotch retired undefeated four years later, allowing others to hold the championship until Ed ""The Strangler"" Lewis won it in 1920 and was described as very boring despite his great nickname, even telling a story of how he wrestled a man for 5 hrs. and 20 mins. This lead to wrestling changing and becoming a little more entertaining and putting time limits on matches.

From here it talks about how the regional territories formed the National Wrestling Alliance and how the first champion was named as voted on by the board. Lou Thesz became the champion and was a major celebrity for a wrestler and held the title on numerous occasions including a 7 year run. When the original nature boy Buddy Rogers became champion, a new age was ushered in, bringing more theatrics and showmanship into it. Thesz won the title back but lost it to Gene Kiniski in 1966 and held it for three years before losing it to Dory Funk Jr.

Champions in the 70's are talked about including both Dory Jr. and Terry Funk (becoming the only brothers to ever hold a world title), Jack Brisco and of course Harley Race. These stories were pretty good and I liked how honest Jack was about the schedule of being champion was too much for him and how after he lost the title he flew home and didn't leave his house for weeks.

Race held the title an at the time record eight times, but his most famous title match may have been in defeat as Ric Flair beat him in a steel cage match at Starrcade '83, which would spark a dominance by Flair through the rest of the decade and had big money rivalries including against Dusty Rhodes, which led to Dusty's second and third title reigns.

When the NWA was bought out by Ted Turner and made WCW, the title began to switch hands numerous times with notable reigns by Sting, Ron Simmons, Vader, Lex Luger, Ric Flair, and of course Hulk Hogan. This was a pretty good segment that showed some wrestlers at their peaks and how happy they were to become champion.

When WWE bought WCW, they brought the title with them and crowned an undisputed champion in December of '01 and he was Chris Jericho. The world title returned and was given to Triple H who would hold it numerous times along with Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, Goldberg, Batista, Undertaker, Edge and plenty of others.

Matches on Disc 1

-6/1961, 2 out of 3 Falls Match, Pat O'Connor (Champion) vs. Buddy Rogers: Black & white, classic and quite good. Of course there were the usual series of rest holds but these two did put on an entertaining match especially for that time. After O'Connor missed a dropkick, Rogers makes the cover to win the match and the title. 7/10. Nice post match promo by Rogers.

-CWF, 2/11/69, Gene Kiniski (Champion) vs. Dory Funk Jr.: Only about 3 minutes is shown, so its not really even worth having on the set since its not in full.

-CWF, 12/10/75, Jack Brisco (Champion) vs. Terry Funk: Here we get 7 or 8 minutes, problem is its still clipped so again it should just have been in full.

-CWF, 8/21/79, Harley Race (Champion) vs. Dusty Rhodes: Now 4 or 5 minutes of action, with Dusty on commentary and its sad this was the third match that was clipped.

-9/28/85, AWA Superclash, Ric Flair (Champion) vs. Magnum T.A.: Flair always made Magnum look greater than he was and this match was no exception. These two brawled good, wrestled better, Ric bled heavily and Magnum almost had the title won a few times, but Flair reverses a roll-up and pulls the tights to win the match and retain his title. 8/10.

-7/7/90, Great American Bash, Ric Flair (Champion) vs. Sting: To prevent outside interference The Steiners, Paul Orndorff and JYD were around the ring and Ole Anderson was handcuffed to El Gigante (The Giant Gonzales). This was a very good match as were all of the Sting/Flair matches, Sting was coming off of having knee surgery and Ric tested and worked on it setting it up for the figure four. Of course Sting was full of energy and threw Flair around the ring early on. Flair goes for the figure four but Sting rolls him up for the 3 count to win his first world title. 9/10.

Disc 2

-1/30/91, Clash of the Champions XIV, Ric Flair (Champion) vs. Scott Steiner: A forgotten match here and its one I wanted to like, I really did. But something just seemed off here, Ric did sell Scott's offense while getting in his usual moves. But the final couple of minutes kill it as Scott seemingly had the match won a few times but didn't make the cover, like they were trying to get to the time limit draw but making it painfully obvious. The time runs out and Ric retains. 5/10.

-7/14/91, Great American Bash, Steel Cage Match, Lex Luger vs. Barry Windham: This was right after Ric Flair had left the company, so we have this match to determine the new WCW champion. Its not bad but honestly doesn't seem to be main event material probably due to Luger being involved. Both guys try and do make some use of the cage in spots but its pretty average honestly. Harley Race comes down and tells Luger ""Its time"", so Lex hits a piledriver on Barry and makes the cover to win the WCW title. 6/10.

-8/2/92, Vader (Champion) vs. Ron Simmons: Quite a good match here as Sting was originally scheduled but Jake Roberts took him out earlier in the evening so Simmons was chosen at random to face the monster Vader. These meshed well together as both were strong and Vader was one of the few monster heels who could look both unstoppable and beatable during his matches. Ron ends up hitting a powerslam out of nowhere and covered Vader for the win to become the first african-american to win the World title. 8/10.

-10/16/93, WCW Saturday Night, Human Cage Match, Vader (Champion) vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat: Human Cage=A Lumberjack match and its fairly average as Ricky got in some moves, but mainly sold, sold and sold to Vader. While the lumberjacks were trying to get Vader into the ring Sid Vicious ran in and powerbombed Steamboat, allowing Vader to pick up the win and retain his title. 5/10.

-10/23/94, Halloween Havoc, Career Ending Steel Cage Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Ric Flair: This was the rubber match as Hogan won at Bash At The Beach, then Flair had won at a recent Clash Of The Champions, so naturally the way to end this was for both to put their careers on the line. I feel this was better than their Bash match as it really had that big match feel, both went all out, tons of near falls. Also Sting, Sensational Sherri, a masked man and referee Mr. T get involved and Hogan ends up taking this one after hitting the legdrop and Mr. T makes the 3 count while handcuffed to the rope. 10/10

-2/22/98, Superbrawl VIII, Hulk Hogan vs. Sting: This was the return match from their infamous Starrcade face/off and also would determine the new WCW champion. Its better than the Starrcade match, but not by too much. Sting still gets dominated for the first few minutes, in the ring and all the way into the aisle. Sting of course makes his comeback and there's the expected NWO run-in, but Randy Savage shockingly hits Hogan, Sting makes the cover and becomes the new WCW champion. 6/10. Fun little post match segment where Sting brands Hogan NWO style, spray painting WCW on his chest.

-7/6/98, WCW Monday Nitro, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Goldberg: With 43,000 plus in the Georgia Dome on hand, this match saw the mega launch of Goldberg as he beat Hogan for the WCW World Title with the spear and jackhammer. Major, major league pop for the finish, though the re-dubbing of the music with Goldberg's WWE music was pretty annoying. 8/10.

-7/9/00, Bash At The Beach, Jeff Jarrett (Champion) vs. Booker T: Earlier Jarrett laid down for Hogan, which prompted a promo bashing Vince Russo and the company's choices and this led to Russo firing Hogan. Having that segment may have made this more memorable as this was a fairly decent match with Booker having wrestled earlier this night but taking it to Jeff early on. There's good action, even going into the crowd for a few. Jarrett goes for the guitar from the top but gets caught in the Book End and Booker covers to win the World Title. 6/10.

-10/21/01, No Mercy, The Rock (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho: This was during the terrible Alliance storyline where WCW/ECW was trying to take down the WWE. These two had great chemistry and it showed in this match. Plenty of counters, good wrestling even a little brawling and the underlying story was could Jericho be a main eventer against the likes of The Rock. He was able to do well though Rock did dominate a good portion of the match, even hitting a Rock Bottom through the announce table, funny how the crowd was more pro-Jericho than pro-Rock. Stephanie McMahon comes down, throws a chair in the ring but gets a Rock Bottom for her troubles. Jericho hits the Breakdown on Rock on a chair and makes the cover to win the WCW title. 10/10.

Disc 3

-9/22/02, Unforgiven, Triple H (Champion) vs. RVD: After being awarded the world title a few weeks prior, Triple H was set to defend against the much deserving RVD. It was a good match, where their unique styles mixed well and also the crowd really, really wanted RVD to win the title and he was close on a few occasions. The ref was knocked out, RVD kicks Triple H in the face, while he was holding the sledgehammer. Ric Flair comes down, grabs the hammer but nails RVD allowing Triple H to hit the pedigree and covers him to retain the title. 7/10. Nice post match where Flair presents the title to the Game.

-10/19/04, Taboo Tuesday, Triple H (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels: Since Summerslam '02 these guys have had some classic matches, this contest however isn't one of them. Shawn was heavily favoring his knee and gave an effort but with his injured knee it wasn't really a very good match at all. HBK goes for sweet chin music, Batista interferes but gets knocked off the apron, Shawn connects with the kick but Edge comes through the crowd and hits the spear on Michaels. Triple H makes the cover to retain his title. 5/10.

-2/19/06, No Way Out, Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. The Undertaker: Very, very, very good one here, both are such great big match players and they really shine in this match. The momentum swings a lot, with each guy getting in some great moves, as Taker hit his usual moves while Angle tries to ground the deadman working on his knee. The ending is great as Angle reverses the triangle choke and pinned his shoulders to the mat so Angle retained his title. 9/10.

-4/7/06, Smackdown, Rey Mysterio (Champion) vs. Randy Orton: Good TV main event here, this would be Orton's last match for two months as he was suspended for violating the wellness policy. Orton worked over the smaller Rey, while Mysterio tried to use his quickness to outsmart Randy. Rey ends up hitting the 619, then the leg drop from the top rope and makes the cover to retain his title. 7/10.

-12/16/07, Armageddon, Batista (Champion) vs. The Undertaker vs. Edge: Early on both Batista and Taker targeted each other and especially Edge who kept running away from both men, only getting in some spots when each man was down. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder came from under the ring as fake Edge's trying to stop both Batista and Taker from winning the match. Taker hits the Tombstone on Batista, but gets hit with a chair by Edge, who makes the cover and wins the World Title. 7/10.

-11/23/08, Survivor Series, Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. John Cena: Just a few weeks after winning the title, Jericho must face the returning John Cena who suffered a neck injury 3 months prior. Its the usual Cena match but is elevated cause he's working with someone as good as Jericho. Chris worked on John's neck with clotheslines and also locked on the Walls of Jericho, while Cena came back locking on the STF, which Jericho gets out of. Cena deadlifts Chris off the mat and hits the FU, makes the cover and he's the new World champion. 8/10.

-6/7/09, Extreme Rules, Ladder Match, Edge (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: Great one here, both take some heavy risks and makes good uses of the ladders around the ring, Jeff gets smahed groin first on a ladder that gets all twisted, Edge misses the spear going head first into the ladder. Nice spot where Edge slaps on a sharpshooter while Jeff was trapped in the ladder. The best spot was when both men fell from a ladder through another ladder set up between the ring apron and the barricade. The finish comes when Jeff pulls Edge's legs in the ladder to trap him and Jeff climbs to get the title. 9/10. Loved how the aftermath was included of CM Punk coming down and cashing in his Money In The Bank briefcase on the beaten up Hardy. Punk ended up hitting his second GTS and made the cover to win the title. Thus began the heel turn of Punk.

I personally liked the documentary as the early parts were very refreshing to hear about and while short it was fun to view. It was great to hear from wrestling historians and people like Jim Crockett, Ric Flair, Jim Ross, Harley Race and so many others. The matches were good for the most part with some duds. Great DVD set to have in your wrestling collection though.",1315094400,2,13561,4.561035758323058
3960552,5,B002NXSRNY,"The documentary over the history over the title was excellent. Probably the best they've ever done. It didn't feel like too much fluff from WWE and more like a real project. Also, they need to bring back whoever narrator was because he did a good job as well. With most biographers start very well then end quickly, I will admit they did a good job thru out.

The matches were range from excellent to good, although the older matches probably don't interest many fans. Some earlier matches were cut like the AWA dvd, so you cannot call it full matches. I enjoyed the WCW matches which also featured the only two black men winning the NWA title(currently).

The packaging of these History of the Title dvds are something WWE needs to start doing more. It's a durable packaging with content listing on each page, I enjoy it.

Overall, a excellent biography, great match selections, and the packaging is great. A must own for all wrestling fans.",1276646400,5,942,4.662650602409639
3960553,4,B002NXSRNY,"The World Heavyweight Championship is a title that has so much history that the three discs it was given was just not enough especially since its been around since 1905. This DVD is great but could be better. The documentary was very good and informative. It talks about the title going back to the when the title was first brought in. It even talks about Flair bringing the title to WWF and them having the blur the title out. There are tons of matches on this set which include some pretty old matches that goes as far back as 1961 which means that there are a lot of years that they don't have matches for but that's probably due to that the matches weren't taped(especially the matches that happened back in 1905 LOL) and the fact that some of the older matches tape quality isn't all that good anymore because of old age. The first 2-discs matches include matches from NWA and WCW while disc 3 is WWE matches when they changed the titles name from the WCW World Title to just World Heavyweight title. Like I said the set includes a lot of great matches but it seems to skip over the years 2003 and 2005. I would of also liked to of seen the Randy Orton vs Chris Benoit match from Summerslam 2004 but because of obvious reason it was not included in the set. I would highly recommend this DVD to any long time wrestling fan because of the huge amount of matches from NWA/WCW. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the history of the title. I would give it a 4 out 5 stars. Like I said at the beginning with as much history as this title has it could have been more then 3-discs but still is a very good DVD.

3960554,4,B002NXSRNY,"As other reviewers have pointed out, there are certainly some sub-par championship matches (Vader vs. Steamboat, Jarrett vs. Booker T, Mysterio vs. Orton).  Still, the documentary is a fascinating, if over-simplified*, account of wrestling's World Heavyweight Championship, and most of the matches carry some historical relevance despite not being included on any other DVD release.  I was pleasantly surprised by matches that I hadn't seen, such as Ric Flair vs. Scott Steiner.

*The DVD chronicles an ethereal ""World Heavyweight Championship,"" which begins as the NWA championship and transforms into the WCW and WWE titles.  The connections are mostly spiritual, as none of the above organizations acknowledge such a lineage, but at least they have the physical connection of the ""Big Gold Belt.""",1264032000,,799,5.524590163934426
8375587,5,B002NXSRNY,"Well, the big brains at WWE who put together these collections rarely come up short when it comes to the documentaries on these DVDs. Another good one here--I guess it could have been more than one hour, but only a minor quibble. Tracing the roots of the title back to the early 1900s, up to the formation of the NWA, then the transition to WCW and when they finally closed the lights out; and the title going to WWE before being unified then resurrected in 2002.

As far as match quality--not really much to bicker about as far as anything being bad. Some matches were probably better than I thought going into it--Windham and Luger jumps off the top of my head; as well as the history behind Ron Simmons beating Vader (good match too).

Another great match from Disc 3 that completely fell out of my mind was the Triple Threat between Taker, Batista and Edge. Of course, the various singles matches those three had with each other were always high quality, so putting all 3 together definitely made for good viewing. I don't know what else to add, except maybe wishing some more title matches with Sting were on here--maybe Sting and Luger at Superbrawl jumps to my mind.

At any rate, great collection....",1513209600,,1208,4.583333333333333

They do a good job of going through the history and giving you some the highlight matches that made these belts such a big deal. Probably don't have every match that every fan wants to see cause most fans have their own personal favorites but they do a good job of touching upon every era up to this point. This volume is slightly different than the other two cause it has a little short documentary on the history of the belt they're covering. Being more a fan of the individual wrestler documentary/collections I was pleasantly surprised by how good these were and the match selection.",1423180800,,675,4.586776859504132
