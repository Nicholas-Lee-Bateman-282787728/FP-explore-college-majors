3727141,5,B001O4KBNM,"I have been on the edge of my seat for almost 4 years ever since the rumors began this wonderful show would be released on DVD.  I hated how Sony was dragging their feet, but I am now delighted Shout! Factory has stepped in.  This was one of the last great TV shows not to be released on DVD.  And what's sad is there are so many silly, ridiculous, and not worth watching TV shows on today that have already been released.  But this show about 4 empowered Southern women who dealt with issues like AIDS, pornography, sexual harassment, racism, weight issues and many others head on had yet to be released.  As a Southern woman myself, I totally identified with these women; even as a little girl growing up watching it in the 80's and early 90's.  What I liked best is it had the perfect blend of drama and comedy to really make it a TV classic.  Now, the most important thing is all DW fans must buy this first season and show their support to ensure the remaining 6 seasons are released.",1237075200,2,989,4.313513513513514
3727142,5,B001O4KBNM,OMG I grew up on this show and I have always wanted to own all the seasons on DVD.  Thank you so much for releasing this.,1236988800,4,121,3.6538461538461537
3727143,5,B001O4KBNM,I wanted this show on DVD for years.  I hope they release all the seasons.  May 26th can't come soon enough.,1236643200,2,108,4.095238095238095

3727146,5,B001O4KBNM,"Finally this show is being released! It's a wonderful show with strong female roles that show women can be fun, smart, even sexy and still be strong business women, too. The Beauty Pageant episode is the one with Julia's ""The Nights the Lights Went out in Georgia"" and I believe that the first season is where Suzanne's ex Jack gets revenge by writing a tell-all book, also this season is where we meet Payne, Julia's son, and his much older girlfriend. These are just a few of the classic episodes- and I am so glad it's finally being released- Thanks to Shout! Keep the seasons coming!",1236038400,4,587,4.547169811320755

In particular episode two, ""The Beauty Contest"" in which Julia delivers her famous ""Night the Lights Went Out In Georgia"" tirade to Miss Georgia World 1986 in response to offensive comments made regarding her sister Suzanne.

I sent it back. When I talked to Amazon, they informed me that the complete season one was only available for purchase to Amazon Prime members. So I had my daughter order it for me, and I paid her back. I would like to try Amazon Prime, but my other half doesn't think we would use it enough to make it worth the cost.

3727162,1,B001O4KBNM,"UPDATE #2: FINALLY received a set that played properly! It shouldn't take 3 tries, but Amazon was prompt in responding and replacing the dvd's.

UPDATE: ordered a second set of DVDs and they, too, were defective. I'm either a glutton for punishment, or really want a GOOD set, but I'm trying one more time... Hey, Amazon! Look into this production run of DVDs!!! They're defective!

okay i LOVED this show and was excited to find the DVDs on amazon... this dvd set, however, was poorly made - full of digital glitches, to the point where one episode locked up the DVD player.... very disappointed!!! i've returned this set (amazon's great with refunds), and am hoping a reorder will provide me with a clean set of DVDs... i ordered Season 2 of the show, but have yet to make it through all the episodes to make sure they aren't faulty as well... hopefully, they aren't...",1495238400,3,931,5.006451612903226

3727167,3,B001O4KBNM,"Was not what I expected. Kinda my own fault b/c I thought it was the full first season but it was just select episodes from the 1st season. Also, once it got to the episode ""Design House"" it just stopped and shut off. I thought it was a fluke so I shut off my DVD player and restarted the episode from the beginning but it stopped again in about the same place so I may just send it back and get the one I actually want.

I could not give 5 stars because it has a sort of ringing sound while watching. None of my other DVD's do that in my BlueRay player. I have watched two discs on this set and both occasionally make the sound. It is not enough to drown out her audio, just can be a little annoying.",1464480000,,409,4.0

3727200,4,B001O4KBNM,"I enjoyed this 1st season of this older show. The writing. I found it humorous, and tactfully honest, but different from other sitcoms of the time, unique in its genuineness about all aspects of male/female humanity and the struggles faced by all peoples, especially those wanting to improve themselves and their situations. Particularly, Anthony (Meshach Taylor), a former African American of prison background, now their furniture delivery man; although character typecast, nevertheless, he was a very good actor for this role. His humor, at least for the viewer, recognizes a man wanting to reform, and showing a man with an internal good heart and a positive attitude, having been given a second chance by these caring females. His character makes it clear that he just made a bad decision, a mistake, now mixing with some strange situations with these variety of 4 female personalities from different southern backgrounds, from conservative to liberal, hard to soft, supporting this agency. This was very good writing for its time. It is funny, putting forth situations that are not that far from human situation.",1451433600,,1118,5.216666666666667

3727202,5,B001O4KBNM,"Linda Bloodworth Thomason developed a largely female sitcom series set in Atlanta, Georgia in 1986. Upon the success of ""Golden Girls"" on NBC, ""Designing Women"" on CBS would be equally successfully especially in its first season. The first season has four DVDs for 20 episodes and includes a reunion at the Paley Center with the original cast and creator/producer Linda Bloodworth Thomason. In the eighties, there were only the networks and syndication for comedy series. ""Designing Women"" struggled to stay on the air and was moved various times on the network schedule. It was best left on Monday nights.

The first season had many memorable guest appearances like Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostley who later joined the series as regulars. Dixie Carter's real life husband Hal Holbrook played her boyfriend on screen. Dixie was Julia Sugarbaker, a feminist, liberal, and outspoken about civil rights, hypocrisies, and sexism in today's world. You wouldn't want to mess with Julia. I loved how she defended her sister Suzanne at a teen beauty pageant. It was one of the most memorable scenes in the first season. Dixie Carter deserved an Emmy for that performance alone. Julia had a son, Payne, and was widowed by Hayden.

Delta Burke played Suzanne Sugarbaker, a former Miss Georgia (she was Miss Florida in real life) and a thrice divorcee with plenty of money. Delta was a scene stealer. She was the only one nominated for an Emmy sady among the cast members. Burke and Carter worked with Linda Bloodworth Thomason on a previous sitcom entitled ""Filthy Rich"" and I somewhat remembered it around. Sadly, the series was cancelled.

Annie Potts (""Pretty in Pink"") came on board and declined the role of Alex Forrest in the film,""Fatal Attraction."" Her portrayal of Mary Jo Shively, the independent divorcee and mother of two young children, Claudia and Quint. She was seeing a nice man (Richard Gilliland who married co-star Jean Smart in real life). Her Mary Jo is quite equally outspoken and opinionated as Julia.

Finally, Jean Smart played sweet, lovable Charlene Frazier. Smart's performance displayed her talent and range for playing one of the sweetest naive characters. Charlene was the oldest of eleven children from the Ozarks. Ironically, Jean would win Emmys and still go on acting as well.

The four of them and the addition of the late Meshach Taylor as Anthony Bouvier had a terrific chemistry and interaction among the five of them. The writing was crisp, funny, witty, and on target. Almost thirty years later, the series is still relevant. It's not the same Atlanta, Georgia of the eighties. Atlanta has changed with an influx of new residents. Tyler Perry has made the city into an entertainment destination for films and television series.

I also enjoyed reading the enclosed booklet by Linda Bloodworth Thomason about the series in it's inception and development for the first season. Too bad, the Viewers for Quality Television isn't still around. There are other quality series that get canceled way too soon.",1450224000,,3034,5.058
3727203,5,B001O4KBNM,Designing Women dvds were not issued by a main studio but instead issued by *'Shout Factory' company. Thanks to them we get to enjoy this great series..  I loved Designing Women when it aired on CBS. Adding Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostly to the ensemble in later seasons was just great. I only watched some episodes of  the last two seasons after changes in the cast. Once you break up the original cast the chemistry is just never the same. This is a great comedy with great Southern women.,1450137600,,493,4.52808988764045

This show, when airing, quickly became my favorite of all time.  Relatable for nearly everyone, it will lift your spirit and fill you with peace.

Every character is so crucial to this show.  Though I tire of Dixie Carter's rants, she does have good points sometimes, and my favorite Suzanne Sugarbaker would not be as funny without her sister.

But now, because I didn't pay good enough attention, I have to order Season One...again. The complete season this time. Whats irritating is that I have read reviews of Season 1, and my favorite episodes are not on Volume One.

3727257,5,B001O4KBNM,"Being much younger than the original viewers, I hadn't seen Designing Women when I ordered the first season of this sitcom on DVD. Having read it was similar to one of my favorite shows, The Golden Girls, I decided to give it a chance.

In Designing Women, I was introduced to Julia Sugarbaker (Dixie Carter), the owner of Sugarbaker & Associates in Atlanta, Georgia; Suzanne Sugarbaker (Delta Burke), Julia's younger, self-centered sister; Mary Jo Shively (Annie Potts), the sarcastic single mother of two; and Charlene Frazier (Jean Smart), the sweet-natured secretary. These four feisty women break the stereotypes of Southern belles: they are not over-sexed romance queens, ignorant country bumpkins, or good-hearted hookers. These women are down-to-Earth ladies, each with a different personality, making them all the more realistic and entertaining.

What I've learned in these 21 first season episodes, is that Designing Women was definitely not afraid of bending the rules of sitcoms, often telling controversial stories that had not been seen on TV before. For example, in the pilot episode, simply called ""Designing Women,"" Suzanne dates Mary Jo's ex-husband, and while Mary Jo tries to remain calm in the situation, the thought of one of her friends dating her ex-husband and the father of her two children, eventually led to an interesting climax.

The second episode, ""The Beauty Contest,"" is one of my favorites from season one. Charlene secretly signs Mary Jo's daughter, Claudia, up for the Miss Pre-Teen Atlanta beauty contest. Mary Jo is initially against the idea, but along with some encouraging from Suzanne (an ex-beauty queen), she soon becomes a clichd stage mother of sorts. Near the end of the episode, the present ""Miss Georgia World"", named Marjorie, makes fun of Suzanne, not knowing Julia hears her. When Julia and Marjorie are left alone, Julia confronts her, proving her wrong about the rumors she had told of Suzanne, ending her soon-to-be famous speech, with the line, ""And that, my dear Marjorie, is the night the lights went out in Georgia!""

Season one has some more hilarious and topical episodes: in the third episode, Charlene dates an overweight man; in the fourth episode, Julia's son, Payne, comes to visit, bringing his 41-year-old girlfriend with him; in the fifth episode, Mary Jo starts dating again after divorce; in the seventh episode, Julia and Suzanne's goofy mother, Perky, comes home for Thanksgiving, bringing her absent-minded friend, Bernice Clifton, with her; and in the eighteenth episode, Charlene dates Mary Jo's dad.

Some other most-see episodes are ""Monette"", when Charlene's old friend, Monette, comes back to town and the other women try to tell Charlene that Monette is the madam of a whorehouse; ""Oh, Suzannah"" is a quirky, each touching episode, where Suzanne offers to keep a Vietnamese orphan for four weeks, not knowing she will become close to her, not wanting her to leave. On disc four, we also get a special reunion with the four stars of the show and their creator, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, from when they where a part of the Fearless Women seminar in 2006.

Season One of Designing Women is well written and hilariously well-played. To be completely honest, it is way better than I was thinking it would be. It is hasn't even been a year and I've already ordered Seasons Two through Six, and planning on ordering Season Seven in the very near future. This is right up there with the best of the TV sitcoms. It is without a question, one of the best shows centering on the lives of women ever made. I assure you by ordering the First Season of Designing Women (or any other season hereafter) will surely not disappoint you. This is coming from a person who had little faith in this show, but who has now become one of its biggest fans!",1393113600,,3814,4.998425196850394

3727259,5,B001O4KBNM,"What a smart comedy this is.  I loved it when it was on TV, and I love it now.  The first 5 seasons, anyway, those with Delta Burke.  Four beautiful, classy intelligent women and one handsome, intelligent man, running a designing business and dealing with daily life somewhere in the American South.  What made this comedy special was the warm relationships between the characters, the fast-paced humor, and the smart exchanges, especially on those inevitable occasions when sparks would fly.",1389830400,,492,5.1125
3727260,5,B001O4KBNM,"It doesn't get much better than ""Designing Women"".  The episodes, many of which were written by the show's creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, brim with intelligence, sly wit, poignance, and fiery passion.  The more ""Designing Women"" episodes you watch, the more you realize that Bloodworth-Thomason and her writing crew were at the height of their artistic powers.  Not only are the stories potently relevant, but the writers add punch to the proceedings in the way they use the sound, rhythm, and arrangement of words to punctuate the action.  They are masters of nuance in language.

Add the gifted and delightfully forthright lead actresses Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, Annie Potts, and Jean Smart who deliver their lines with verve and sincerity, and mix in the comedic grace of Meshach Taylor and the eccentric charm of Alice Ghostly, and you have a magical formula which seems effortlessly achieved.

""Designing Women"" is a true classic which you can revisit repeatedly and still be inspired.  Plaudits to Shout Factory for preserving this delicious entertainment on DVD especially for those of us who appreciate quality television.",1388361600,2,1136,5.312849162011173

I remembered liking their outfits, the funny situations they got themselves into (especially the growth of the friendship between Suzanne and Anthony), the shows about social interests at the time (much like ""The Golden Girls""), and certain episodes that really stuck in my head.

However, unlike ""The Golden Girls,"" watching this again as an adult, the magic is not there anymore and I do not like this show as much as I remembered liking it as a kid. Some of the comedic timing feels off, the chemistry between the characters feels dim and forced sometimes, and I found myself strongly disagreeing with some of the approaches that were taken with various social viewpoints, and especially with how Julia handled herself with regard to some of them.

Additionally, even as a kid and still now, the series past season 5 was awful--absolutely awful. I wouldn't even bother to own them on DVD. The absences of Charlene (Jean Smart) and Suzanne (Delta Burke), both of whom were integral in carrying the show, were gaping holes that could not be filled by: Bernice (Alice Ghostley), who was just annoying; Carlene (Jan Hooks), who was ditzy like Charlene, but lacked the substance she had; B. J. Poteet (Judith Ivey) and Allison Sugarbaker (Julia Duffy) were just weren't memorable. Plus, Julia's character (Dixie Carter), who already made me uncomfortable, became a raging tyrant who seemed to have lost her sense of self.

I waffled between three stars and four stars for this, and went with four stars because, even if it is not the magic I remembered as a kid, I still think it was a cutting edge show at the time that was well done for the first five seasons, the original casting was very well done, and the friendship between Suzanne and Anthony is hilarious and satisfying. I took off one star for how much it tanked in the last two seasons when the producers were so obviously and painfully struggling to keep it afloat.",1295308800,3,1980,4.783625730994152

I have loved this series for years!  Until I lost all my movies in Hurricane Ike, I watched (poorly) copied versions of the few episodes I had managed to catch on tape - it was not very satisfying, as the reruns never have the full show and some of my favorite lines were often cut - but, it was better than going without seeing these fabulous shows at all!

Somehow, I missed the release of the first three seasons - I used to check regularly but have been in Ike recovery until recently - until today with the sad news of Mrs. Carter's passing.

Such a loss!

I agree with so many other posters - I can relate to each of these fabulous women at some point or another, but always strive to have the grace and elegance of Julia.

3727378,4,B001O4KBNM,"My Wife would give this show 5 stars. It was one of her all time favorites. As I often watch her shows with her I have to give it 3 stars due to the poor quality of the scan. I'm thinking it was done years ago for VHS release. They just grabbed these scans and ran them through software for DVD and shoved them out the door. If you pause the show you can see signs of compression. If you're watching on a 19"" tube, probably not a problem, on a 37"" LCD it appears like its out of focus. For a new release this is unacceptable. I/m going to pretend to watch and read my paper.
UPDATED 4/12/11 I have noticed other older shows that were ""taped in front of a live audience"" having the same problem in sharpness. The tapes were most likely recorded analog at a resolution that is in conflict with a DVD's resolution. If not properly converted in skilled hands these shows will suffer some degrading compared to filmed shows. So I am upping my review to 4 stars.",1244592000,35,956,4.201086956521739
3727379,5,B001O4KBNM,"Finally, and perhaps fashionably late, the show 'Designing Women' makes a proper, full season, DVD debut. Watching the first full season of this show is both enjoyable if not a bit surprising. Usually, it takes a normal show an entire season to really define itself and find its legs. That is not the case with this show. I was surprised by how many remarkable big moments occurred within the first season. You have the famous Julia Sugarbaker 'The Night The Lights Went Out in Georgia' speech, a big episode about women's health and breast cancer, sexual harassment and even issues of race (and of course gender) all packed into one season.

Quality wise, the only video-to-dvd transfer that seemed off was the pilot episode. When I saw it, I was worried how the remainder of the episodes were going to appear. Yet, by the second episode, the transfer and quality are of little concern. Plot/content wise, the episodes do not disappoint. Most left me in tears from laughing or from the sheer honesty/sincere words these characters spoke. What works best with 'Designing Women' is that while it's a comedy and is aimed at making you smile and laugh, it managed to take on big, at times daunting, issues that no one at the time took on. Watching the whole first season will in fact make you wonder what's happened to television because this, like other shows from this era, is a real show that portrayed life-like characters that you can't wait to watch and wish you could have the opportunity to interact with.

I also am more than pleased that Shout Factory chose to include the panel/reunion at the Paley Center for Media from 2006. While some may skip over this feature thinking it's boring and dull, I encourage everyone to actually watch it. Hearing how the show came about from the creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason made me appreciate the show even more. Hearing the actors and their individual anecdotes and stories on the characters, favorite lines, quotes in this live setting really was enjoyable because, like the show, it contained moments of pure amusement and laughter as well as very telling, intimate moments that made me appreciate this show and those involved even more.

In all, a great release and a must own for anyone looking for quality television that'll have you both laughing and thinking at the same time.",1244246400,8,2332,4.825
3727380,5,B001O4KBNM,"I am thrilled to have DESIGNING WOMEN finally on dvd.  I loved this show when it originally aired and have seen all episodes countless times in repeats but it is still nothing compared to watching them in order, remastered and uncut without commercials.  For me the series had two lives - the years with Delta Burke and the years without.  The years with Delta and the original foursome are the classic years that put this show up there with the best in history.  The years after were merely different retoolings to try and find the previous glory but magic only happens once.

The pilot episode is a classic in itself and shows how a mere 20 minutes of television can make you feel like you already know the four leads and also have a hilarious plot as well.  Julia with her RAY DAWN speech is legendary.  Each of the four women here are amazing and provide pitch perfect characterizations.  Each one is a certain type of woman everyone can identify with.  They all have their strengths and their weaknesses.  Everyone will have a favorite and mine is indeed Suzanne.  I always thought that the writers/producers made Suzanne more comical after Delta Burke started putting on the weight.  Watching this season where she is ultra slim you see that they slowly brought out the slapstick nature of Suzanne throughout the first season.  And no one could play it like her.  And the intro of Anthony just fills you with excitement of the hilarity to come with the special bond these two formed.

The digital remastering is perfect here and the show is in no way dated.  It was topical when it first aired and it still remains strong.  And of course what will always last is the comedic timing and perfect chemistry of these four gals.  Bring me all the seasons with the original four.  I am ready.  Can't recommend this show highly enough.  It is a testament to purely perfect television with amazing producing, writing, casting and acting.",1244246400,3,1935,4.665680473372781

The music sounds great, the episodes are in their entirety, and the show looks great.  Fans of ""Designing Women"" are advised to buy!  Season 1 features 21 (almost all great) episodes, including ""The Beauty Pageant,"" the pilot episode, ""Grand Slam, Thank you Ma'am,"" and ""Monette.""  The only bonus feature is the reunion of the 4 central actresses and the creator, Linda Bloodworth Thomason.  It was a nice touch to include it, and get a first person perspective on their favorite episodes and scenes.  The only thing that I could wish for was commentary on an episode or two, but overall this DVD set is an A.",1243641600,2,777,4.718518518518518

I would strongly recommend this to anybody who is true fan like am of this wonderful comedy. I paid $ 79:50 plus the s/h charges so my total was in all $ 87.45 for all seven seasons. What a deal. If you want the link let me know to the site and i'll share it with you. They have all sorts of TV series and at wonderful prices. Plus hard to find titles as well that aren't released just yet.""UPDATE 5/25/2011  "" I totally regret buying these now. Once they came I started watching them and they did turn out to be CRAP !!! Someone had totally taped them from there TV Set and are selling them on this site. Stay away from this site and all others that are like this one. If I knew then what I know now I would have waited for the proffesional ones to be produced and sold here on Amazon. I totally jumped the gun on this series. Guess I got what I had coming for being impatient. My mistake and shame on me for doing so. Sorry I never got back to any of the comments that were left for me here till now But plan on buying these episodes soon least I know they will all be professionally done and re-produced and of good quality.
