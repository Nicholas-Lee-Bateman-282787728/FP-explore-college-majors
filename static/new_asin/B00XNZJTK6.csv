8716375,5,B00XNZJTK6,"This film was scary the first time that I saw it  40 years ago and it remains scary today! It just shows you that a movie doesn't need vulgar language or excessive blood-splatter or nudity to make viewers bring their legs up off the floor and curl up on the couch! Back in 1947 Hollywood had standards, and this is just one example of it. The script, the scene shots, and the actors all provided the suspense necessary to have chills run down the collective spines of viewers. Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey do a great job of creatiing suspenseful fear using only their voices and facial expressions. Real actors! While I admit that I love the amazing ability of CGI to create an otherwise impossible scenes and characters, many of todays actors lack the chops to create the same level of suspense without the aid of CGI (Except for Sir Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Wolfman, etc.). Recommend this for family veiwing!!",1512000000,,926,4.612121212121212
