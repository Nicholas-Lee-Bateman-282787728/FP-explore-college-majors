8125782,1,B000FS2WKS,"I lived through this peace-love-dove starry-eyed New Age nonsense in the 60s and 70s, and it was no ""spiritual awakening"" for anyone, as depicted in this propaganda film.  Rather, it was a time of counter-culture rebellion, liberal drug experimentation, communist infiltration of our educational institutions, violent street protests, race riots, and a proliferation of New Age cults that indoctrinated and exploited the gullible.

I still know people who were Krishnas in the 1970s; and, today, they just shake their heads and shrug, ""What the hell was I thinking back then?""  Make no mistake, there was a lot of mental and physical abuse, starvation and even slavery that went on behind closed doors in those ""enlightened"" spiritual movements.

This was finally revealed in a big way when the communist Reverend Jim Jones and his People's Temple cult committed mass homicide/suicide in the late 70s.  THAT'S when people REALLY started waking up to the brainwashing and hucksterism of the New Age movement.

What should concern everyone is that Leftist/Socialist politicians and instigators over the last decade have very deliberately steered America back in time by 50 years to the racial division, sexual revolution, drug experimentation, street violence, militant activism, and outright communist indoctrination of the 1960s and 70s.

Thus, any ""spiritual awakening"" and ""consciousness-raising"" movements today should be cautiously compared to the New Age cults of that mercifully bygone era, because it seems we've been led in a huge, 50-year circle back to the brainwashed decadence of the 1960s and 70s.

I'm not saying that this is a bad film, but its dreamy content definitely whitewashes and sugar-coats what was actually happening back then.",1514505600,,1752,5.415441176470588
8125783,4,B000FS2WKS,"The ""aliens"" that this 1978 documentary (directed by Don Como) is about, are ""spiritually awakened"" gurus of the 1960s and 70s, on a mission to lead humanity to a ""breakthrough in consciousness.""  The film is broken into thematic sections on topics such as the role of a guru, yoga, meditation, etc. separated by psychedelic ""space"" footage with electronic sound effects, and songs by Donovan (who also narrates), often performed while walking on rocky seashores. An Indian actor dressed as a guru gives advice on selecting and interacting with a guru.

Segments include 60s radical Rennie Davis describing his transformation into a meditator through the influence of the adolescent Guru Maharaji, testimonials by a lawyer/politician and an actress, discussing the powerful effect that Swami Muktananda has on them, the kidnapping of a Hare Krishna devotee by her family for de-programming (and her subsequent escape), and Sai Baba, an ""avatar of God,"" ""miraculously"" producing large amounts of ashes from an upside down vase.

The sections on yoga include Swami Satchidananda's devotees walking on hot coals; Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini Yoga summer solstice festival, in which large numbers of white clad, turbaned hippies are singing and dancing in circles and then have a group wedding; and a woman having kundalini experiences vacillating between speaking rationally and barking like a dog. The beginning of a segment on sexual tantric yoga is shown, which was apparently cut short on this DVD. The meditation section focuses on the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his TM movement. He gives a discourse, and is then shown being given an award from the Illinois state legislature.

Towards the end, the focus changes from Indian to American gurus, which features footage of the late Father Yod, a health food restaurant owner turned leader of the white-robed Source Family (the subject of an excellent recent documentary directed by one of the other reviewers of this film). Elizabeth Clair Prophet, the leader of the Summit Mission, describes herself as a ""messenger of the gods"" or what is now called a channeler. This group looks more like a traditional church congregation, with  lots of older people in suits, but does really strange high-speed chanting. Finally, Baba Ram Das (formerly Harvard psychologist Richard Alpert) tells a funny story about being recognized by a devotee while waiting in line to go into a porno movie.

This was an enjoyable period piece, and gives insight into an interesting period in American history. Almost every one of the teachers featured here was later involved in (or accused of involvement in) a variety of hijinks of questionable ethics. No critical viewpoints are really presented here. Interestingly, no Buddhist teachers are featured in the film. The societal breakthrough in consciousness predicted here has not yet come to pass, and maybe never will, but clearly at least some individuals received benefit from these ""alien's"" teachings and being a member of their communities. The sound and picture quality isn't always great on this DVD. It would be nice if someone could re-master it and restore the missing parts.",1404432000,2,3158,5.243564356435644

""Aliens"" is a wild, deeply moving insider's view into the guru/yogi/cult/consciousness/alt. spirituality explosion of the 60s and 70s. With incredible archival footage and narrated Donovan (!!!), who also provides the film's soundtrack, this forgotten jewel of a film has original footage of the most controversial and popular spiritual leaders of the time and their followers, including  Sai Baba, Yogi Bhahan, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Guru Maharaj Ji, Sri Sathya, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Ram Dass and Father Yod (and the Source Family at morning meditation!!). This includes jaw-dropping footage of thousands of white, middle class young people walking across coals, recounting their kidnapping by ""deprogrammers"", chanting with shaved heads or long, long hair, and devoting themselves unconditionally, and with a deep satisfaction, to God Consciousness via their ""alien"" spiritual leaders.

The film also features Cybil Shepard, Martin Landau, Chicago 7 activist-turned-mystic Rennie Davis, actors Leigh Taylor Young, Linda Day George, and Raymond Bur getting starry-eyed about their gurus and God consciousness. Wowza!

This is one of the only films of the era I've seen that intelligently and provocatively counteracts the schlock and mass media sensationalism that basically demonized a generation of seekers in the 70s.

The film is at turns riveting, hilarious, mind blowing, and deeply moving. With its sympathetic viewpoint, ""Aliens"" stands, thirty years after it was made, as one of the most authentic documents of the era, and provides insight into a powerful movement of the 70s that is still widely misunderstood or even forgotten to this day--especially by current and recent ""countercultures"".
