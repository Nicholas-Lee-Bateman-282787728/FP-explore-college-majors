4482519,5,B004VF66V2,This film is based on a true story of a gypsy family in France during World War II.  One expects horror and tragedy from such a premise and those are present.  But what makes the film so memorable is that much of it shows great beauty.  I find it hard to put the feelings this film brought into words.  Just see it yourself.,1339804800,5,324,4.095238095238095
4482520,4,B004VF66V2,"Research supplemented with the director's & writer's attention to detail suggests that this film somewhat accurately portrays the lives of Romani (Gypsy) peoples around the time of WWII; although, perhaps, sympathetically. The movie was educational, entertaining and suspenseful and would have been worthy of five stars except the editing left too many scenes unfinished or incomplete either in background material or in helping the viewer forward from scene to scene within the movie and for the years after the final scene.

Worth watching if just for the engaging acting.",1313280000,2,574,5.449438202247191
4482521,5,B004VF66V2,"For many years, Tony Gatlif has been giving us vivid glimpses of Romani (or Roma or Gypsy) life in Europe. I've watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crazy-Stranger/dp/B0009WIEA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crazy Stranger</a>&nbsp;a half dozen times since it was released years ago and I love it every time. Gatlif is French-Algerian-Romani, now in his 60s, and he has used his melding of cultures to throw open windows on the lives of Romani people. While you might consider that merely an intriguing insight into a colorful ethnic group, Gatlif's storytelling is vitally important because of the deeply rooted racism still encountered by this community across eastern Europe. It's not too strong to say: To this day, their very lives depend on their being understood by the rest of the world.

Gatlif has labored so creatively and compassionately for years, particularly in his wistful tales like Crazy Stranger, that he and his movie ensembles make us all long for some encounter with the Romani. Now, in his most ambitious feature film, Korkoro (a word that means freedom), Gatlif finally dives into the crucible of the Holocaust, when as many as a quarter of Europe's 2 million Romani were murdered. That era in particular, when Romani were widely called the ""vermin"" of Europe much like the Jews, planted the seeds of the continuing anti-Romani bias in the lands of the former Soviet Union.

If you've never seen a Tony Gatlif film about the Romani, you are in for a shock! He pierces our assumptions and surprises us at every turn. As the film opens, we see the iconic Holocaust image of barbed wire--but soon the wind blowing on the wire plucks a lively Romani tune. Every situation in life must be turned into the music of movement in Romani culture. Next, we see that core principle vividly in the jingling and jangling of a Romani caravan.

It isn't a spoiler to tell you that, yes, this ends as Holocaust films do end, although once again Gatlif surprises us by leaving the final demise of this lively family of 15 men, women and children until after the final titles. In fact, Korkoro may have set some kind of record in Holocaust movies for a lack of Nazis. Oh, they are omnipresent but Gatlif, whose own roots are deep in French Algeria, is particularly indicting French collaboration with the Holocaust. We meet several brave French heroes in the course of the film, but we also encounter a host of French bigots. In one scene, French farmers nearly bloody the Romani refugee family out of sheer hatred for these people--a scene that might have been shot in some small eastern European town today.

The great sages of Holocaust writing insist that there is no lesson to be learned from the Holocaust, except that we must always remember and be ever vigilant. There is no silver lining to the Holocaust. And, by extension, Holocaust films and books aren't supposed to be entertaining. Gatlif embraces that code in Korkoro, although there are scenes in this film so wonderfully alive with color, music and humanity that the ending will surely bring a tear. The film both opens and closes with music and Korkoro might be called Gatlif's Romani hymn recalling and celebrating the countless lost families.",1309824000,22,3268,5.035120147874307

4482533,5,B004VF66V2,"""We have been thrown out from the sky and the light..."" These are words from the ending of Tony Gatlif's masterpiece of one Romani family's capture and imprisonment in 1940's France during WWII.  The numbers vary but approximately one million Gypsies were murdered in the Holocaust (Devouring).  Gatlif's movie is like listening to the many violin pieces throughout:  we are thrown to the depths of despair, lifted up to heavenly lightness and once again let down, none too gently, into the reality of life.  Korkoro--Freedom--will never be the same again.",1407628800,,556,5.144444444444445
4482534,4,B004VF66V2,"A beautiful but haunting movie about the freedom gypsies love and seek in life, and the people in charge, who want to stamp them out permanently.

The Veterinarian and the schoolteacher warmed my heart with how they went out of their way to help the gypsies. Also how the gypsies took in the boy who had no home and made him feel like family made me so happy.

Taloche's seeming descent into madness was hard to watch and made me want to cry. Their plight, hardships and persecution by others, for just wanting to live life on their terms made me so angry and sad.

By the end of the film, I had forgotten totally that this was based on a true story, and the ending left me devastated and heartbroken.  I keep crying about this movie, it touched me in so many ways.

It is a very beautiful film and sad to watch but I am better for having seen it.",1406246400,,847,4.203703703703703

4482536,4,B004VF66V2,"'Heartbreaking?' Of course it is! WWII and the Nazi regime left heartbreak in it's wake. Are there still those that would deny the Holocaust? The storyline is a simple one that was too often repeated in reality. Cinematology and casting is well done. The film offers a glimpse into the Romani culture that has existed over the centuries. Reading the translation isn't necessary . . . the actions of the cast needs no translation. Perhaps an understanding of French and German might add dimension to detail for some . . . it's easily understandable. Cinematology is definitely the strong point of this film. Would choose to disagree that 'original footage' should be a necessary pert of this genre. For me, original footage is best presented in a documentary or docudrama. Recommended for those who appreciate this genre and for those who might want a place to begin. If you find subtitles annoying then this might not be for you!",1391472000,,929,4.849056603773585
4482537,5,B004VF66V2,"Of the two million gypsies living in Europe during WW II, it is estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 gypsies were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators, and this mass murder of the gypsies is referred to as Porajmos or ""The Devouring"". This French film (with English subtitles) by director Tony Gatlif narrates what happened to a band of 15 gypsies who were traveling through France during WW II.

As much as the film records the suffering of these gypsies as they are persecuted wherever they go, it also portrays the beauty of the gypsy culture: their passion for music and dancing, the strong sense of familial solidarity and of taking care of their own, and above all, their love of ""korkoro"", i.e. freedom. This love for an unfettered life, of living in the great outdoors and being at one with nature is especially evident through the portrayal of the character Taloche (James Thirre), an eccentric childlike character who provides much comic relief but whose relentless pursuit of freedom proves to be his undoing.

Aside from the gypsies, the movie also focuses on a French veterinarian, Thodore Rosier (Marc Lavoine) and a French schoolteacher/ town hall secretary, Mademoiselle Lundi (Marie-Jose Croze), who together help these gypsies. Ms. Lundi tries to encourage the children in the gypsy family to attend school, emphasizing the importance of literacy, while Mr. Rosier helps make the gypsies feel welcome in a village where most of the natives view the gypsies with suspicion and even hatred. When the gypsies are carted off by the local gendarmes and Nazis to an internment camp, Rosier selflessly deeds over part of his property so that they can be freed (the law at the time decreed that nomads were to be incarcerated, which obviously was targeted at the gypsies, and if it could be proven that the gypsies owned land or property, then they could be freed).

The film also explores the nature of collaboration and resistance. Rosier and Lundi epitomize the self-sacrificing members of the Resistance, while the prominent man in the village, Pierre Pentecte (Carlo Brandt) is depicted as a Nazi collaborator, a one-time friend of the gypsies who not only turns his back on them, but relentlessly hunts them down.

One highlight of this film is the use of Roma music which accompanies many scenes in this remarkable film. There is happy, dancing tunes, and fast-paced music (as when the gypsies flee the Germans), and comic tunes as well as sad, poignant pieces. It is so much a part of the film that I can still hear these tunes as I type this review. A memorable, haunting film, ""Korkoro"" deserves a wider audience.",1391472000,,2648,4.917225950782997
4482538,5,B004VF66V2,"I'm not sure why I liked this film so much.
Maybe the closeness & protection toward all in the band of gypsies. The man who was mentally ill but in touch with nature who was loved unconditionally. I haven't been able to get the film out of my mind. It was well done, the acting, directing, cinematography, history base on true events &  maybe the romanticism of real freedom, the love of music, family, leadership. i found I was so bothered & uncomfortable by the fact that the people were so dirty  & how water in a faucet was viewed. Why?  My own conditioning. I also, enjoyed the other film by this director, ""the Crazy Stranger"" but this film ' felt so authentic. I don't know if there is a cd of the music but I'm going to find out.
I'm going to purchase since I can't stop thinking about it. I'll show to a film group.
Free streaming on Prime & only 2.99 to rent.

Since the time in which this film delves, there is another side to the problem of the  gypsy Diaspora in Europe.
BBC shows what has happened with gypsy culture since WW2 which is not a pretty sight.

See it~

4482541,5,B004VF66V2,"I briefly heard about the Romany Gypsies while at university.  I was fascinated.  I was watching it on TV recently and only caught half of it that is why I ordered it.  For me the movie was quite Anthropological as I felt it captured the raw and free spirit of the Romany Gypsies, and how horrific it must have been to be captured, imprisoned not knowing what was happening, treated badly and then shot or gassed to death within Hitlers extermination of human beings who did not fit with his idea of a pure german race.  The Romany Gypsies lust for life, their unique music and dance, and ways of being in the world was awesome to observe especially their children.  Another little known tragedy of the Hitler regime that would be valuable within High School History Education.
