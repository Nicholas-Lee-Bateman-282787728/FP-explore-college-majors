8527191,2,B008EWNP9O,"i always loved the don't look in the basement but,this is a case of making a film widescreen by blowing up the image,cutting inches off the original print.you are much better off with this film in its original full screen aspect ratio.dont open the door is in its original aspect ratio.",1426204800,2,286,4.627450980392157
8527192,4,B008EWNP9O,"Don't Look In The Basement, the half of this double feature I bought the DVD for, is listed as being 1.33:1 Full Frame. It's not. It's actually around 1.78:1 and the video transfer is much better than on the previous VCI DVD, with exception to the picture's color saturation level being a touch too much (I solved this by adjusting the picture on my TV).",1403568000,4,354,4.461538461538462
8527193,5,B008EWNP9O,I bought this dvd mainly for Don't Look In The Basement hoping to get a widescreen print. I was in luck and VCI Entertainment used a widescreen print even though most info I read online said otherwise.,1384646400,7,201,4.45945945945946

8527195,4,B008EWNP9O,"This Scream Theater double feature DVD has the best looking transfer I've seen of Don't Look in the Basement. It is still one of my favorite drive-in movies from the 70s, and played as the third feature at drive-ins in the Philadelphia area for many years.. It has suspense, humor and a great cast of eccentric characters. Everyone I've met who has seen this movie remembers Mrs. Callingham. (""Up the airy mountain ..."")  Don't Open the Door is also a very good transfer. While not as good a movie as Basement, it's still an entertaining, if not very surprising thriller. Now I hope someone will release good DVD transfers of S.F. Brownrigg's other 70s thrillers: 'Keep My Grave Open' and 'Scum of the Earth' (Poor White Trash Part 2).",1373587200,6,735,4.6976744186046515
