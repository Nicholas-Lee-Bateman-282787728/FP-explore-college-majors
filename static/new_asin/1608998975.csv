I have been documenting Biblical scriptures which agree with current findings in Science.  Also, it is interesting to find very educated Scientists who are also Bible believers.",1441584000,2,347,5.2727272727272725

7800353,5,1608998975,This documentary serves as a great introduction to the supposed conflict between science and faith and explores the various points of contention with great detail and brevity. I'd recommend this for anyone who has difficulty reconciling their faith with modern science or for those who are unfamiliar with some of the important questions that science raises about the nature of reality and how those questions relate to the existence of a God (This documentary discusses more than just the evolution of life).,1393200000,,509,5.219512195121951
