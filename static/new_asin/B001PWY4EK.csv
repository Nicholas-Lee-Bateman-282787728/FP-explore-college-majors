3762093,5,B001PWY4EK,"A few noted reviewers here use the SASS abbreviation - and this would apply here in the forefront of all synopses for those that suffer from it. For me though, I watched this film from beginning to end without ever wanting to fast-forward, without ever wanting to see all that was being left out. Truly one of the only films this year that deserves the independent support but with a mainstream cast.

This will probably be one of the only bare bones DVDs that gets a 5 star from me, but the performances, quality and nuanced displays of professionalism make this a stand-alone art piece. The Amazon description actually gives away too much, so any more description would be moot for getting the full effect of what this has to offer. But maybe a small indulgence...

Two story lines intertwine about the character's lives in 1940s France and modern day New York City. One of a retired NYC detective playing the private eye, and another of a corporate cover-up man that grows a conscience and decides to end his life in the way he deems fit to make things right.

The music, camera angles, inter-spliced monotony of lifestyles, and mystery of storytelling all make for a minimalist piece that only a few will enjoy. I have read a plethora of complaints about being bored, nothing happening, and ""I don't get it"" whiners filling the ranks, so if you find yourself saying this when watching a good film, then skip this one.

I found no fault with the sound, picture or soundtrack - just a quality piece about memories, life and the events that can lead up to one's reckoning for the things done wrong in life. I related to the loss of one's self in this, and the film offers much to think about in making the choices we do as we get older. Hope you enjoy a great film.",1239580800,20,1766,4.509375
8334766,3,B001PWY4EK,Rather slow-moving film.  Not a lot of actions I guess because of the age of the actors.  Otherwise okay.,1507507200,,105,4.473684210526316
8334767,5,B001PWY4EK,"Frank Langella and Elliot Gould play off each other wonderfully well in this something of a mystery.  A bit confusing introduction about two boys running from German soldiers during the last days of World War 2 brings us to current time.  Langella is Jimmy Stevens, a whistleblower at a corrupt energy company.  He is fairly quickly found out by the hired thugs of the corporation but in a strange twist, asks that they give him two weeks to clear out the remains of his life.  What he does is truly compelling.  He hires Frank Turlotte, an ex cop, now doing straight forward private eye photographs.  He's also a bird watcher.  Stevens talks to Turlotte in two ways.  By phone as the client who has hired Turlotte to watch Stevens.  And their meetings on a park bench where they share bird watching stories.
Along the way we see Stevens wind up a romance with a cabaret singer.  As the days dwindle  down,  Turlotte finally realizes who his client is.
The ending should not be a mystery but I was still taken by its subtlety, a truly emotional conclusion.
I am not familiar with director/ co-writer Richard Ledes work, but he handled this without it being maudlin or melodramatic.  A fine movie.",1468972800,,1196,4.6380952380952385
8334768,4,B001PWY4EK,"Reviews I've read seem to be either very positive or very negative. People looking for action/thriller/suspense were definitely disappointed. The plot is pretty clearly spelled out at the beginning, so there's little suspense, and the big surprises that affect the two main characters are no surprise to the audience. Action? Precious little. So if there's no action and no suspense, what's left? CHARACTER. The two men in this story are compelling, and are well written, directed, and acted.

I watched it because I'm a Frank Langella fan, and find any of his films to be worth the time spent. I haven't seen Elliot Gould for years (decades) and was pleasantly surprised that he carried his important role so well.

If you dislike subtitles, be warned: Some flashbacks to 1940s France are spoken in French and subtitled, plus a few lines here and there in the present-day portion of the movie. Not enough to annoy me, even though I was knitting a sock while watching the film!

The Amazon.com description of the movie really gives away too much, and one reviewer mentioned that if you look at the pictures on the back of the DVD in sequence, they give away the whole plot. But the plot is merely a vehicle for telling a compelling story of two men's memories. Beautifully filmed and one I would hope to watch again someday.",1315612800,2,1324,4.77292576419214
8334769,2,B001PWY4EK,"""To thy audience be true"" should be Frank Langella's motto. Then he wouldn't make movies like this! He's boring, the movie's predictable and has a central character named on the DVD cover's back. Heck, it has the storyline if you look at the pictures clockwise. I'll save the suspense and use the pence (penny.) If you REALLY have to have THE CALLER then buy the USED for ONE PENNY plus tax and tags. That brings the tab up to around THREE DOLLARS.

I wished to see what Langella was like in a 21st century film. He's still handsome, has ""those lips, those eyes"" and will forever (at least in photos.) If this one is any indication of what the others are then NO Langella ever again for me! He's best known for DRACULA from his stage play of the same name. His class films began in DIARY OF A MAD HOUSEWIFE, THE 12 CHAIRS,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twelve-Chairs/dp/B000G6BLT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twelve Chairs</a>, THOSE LIP-THOSE EYES, SPINX, anything in the 1980-90's. Perhaps he should remain on the stage. He recently portrayed ""Thomas More"" in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. Langella was acclaimed for his stage work and just now was an Academy award ""Best Actor"" nominee. He made films for money, had fun on stage and won numerous awards there. Was he A MAN ONLY FOR THE 20TH CENTURY?

If you're looking for a great film to buy, look for Timothy Dalton on Amazon and buy his. They are ALL great and his Bond brought out the tears and grit first. He admires Daniel Craig for taking up where he left off. ""Nobody does it better...than Timothy Dalton then Daniel Craig.""",1281225600,,1616,4.851449275362318
8334770,4,B001PWY4EK,"So close. There are stunning visual glimpses of the upper west side, France at war, a mythic-reality tango accordionist, ... .  These cinematic gems are worth the price of admission. Yet at moments the writing jars. Pity. Making movies is difficult.",1268611200,,249,5.073170731707317
8334771,1,B001PWY4EK,I got this because the principal actors are so excellent.  But the movie is so slow and boring with so many half-hearted plot elements I could hardly watch it.,1264204800,,159,4.482758620689655
8334772,5,B001PWY4EK,"Powerfully intense, artistically original, organically dramatic and lyrically tragic are some of the most conspicuous profiles of this singular film.

A troubled man who has been emotionally wounded by the crimes of the war, decides by himself to hire ""a private eye"" in order to investigate himself to carve in relief the unsaid levels of corruption around the company he works.

The use of ""Nosferatu"" as visual metaphor of the predation in progress or the projection during five seconds of ""Paths of glory"" when the destiny of the soldiers have been made are brilliant metaphors that accent the tragedy of this isolated man who loves a jazz singer becoming her a sophisticated lady (in honor to George Gershwin) seeks comfort around the simple friendship of a little child. Unable to make a crude statement he gives the main clues to all of those who surround him to try to show the rottenness through ""a discrete make up process"" about the real situation and the sending of a devastating video clip in South America, demolishing unquestionable.

A mature existential drama that overpasses by far the anecdote by itself. As it's usual Frank Langella gives us a towering performance as well as Elliot Gould in this intimate human portrait.

Don't miss it by any reason.",1242864000,2,1271,4.953051643192488
8334773,3,B001PWY4EK,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. A man is shown dealing in some business deals that smack of illegality.
2. Later he falsifies some reports knowing that they will lead to his being executed.
3. The hit man that is to execute him gives him a call on the phone and he asks for a delay of two weeks (lest information be given that incriminates the company for which the businessman worked).
4. The businessman hires a detective to follow him-- but the detective does not know that it was actually the businessman who hired him.
5. We see snippets of the businessman's life and find out that he was survivor of WWII and he hired the detective so that he would not have to be alone when he died.
6. The businessman is eventually summarily executed (and does not die alone).

This really stretched the plausibility test. The acting was very good and very serious/ sober. But if someone wanted to die, and he wanted someone with him when he died, couldn't he have found some other way from among his many contacts so to do?

There was also the issue of his mother. Was she sane or wasn't she? Could there really be a human being that old on the planet (she would have to have been nearing 105 for the things in the movie to make sense)? And what was going on with her accent? At one time, she had a German accent. At another time, she had an American accent. And then still another time, she had a French accent.

This is worth a rental price-- but not a theater ticket.",1241308800,,1464,4.3321167883211675
8334774,4,B001PWY4EK,"The Caller has a European feel to it in that it explores the little things in detail while leaving some big things unsaid.  Its not a complicated story, nor is it the non-stop action film portrayed in the trailer but its distinctive and entertaining.  Frank Langella is on the money.  Four stars because Elliot Gould says his lines in such a way that you expect his eyeballs to move from side to side.",1240617600,2,401,4.465753424657534
8334775,5,B001PWY4EK,"This is the kind of film that you convince yourself you are just going to have on in the background while you do something else, until you slowly come the realization that you have absorbed every detail, heard every word, lived every moment, shared every note of the score ... with them.  What began as cold and detached, has become warm, righteous and has taught you a lesson about how you want to live and the importance of the people in your life.  Simple, bittersweet, truth.",1239667200,8,479,4.558139534883721
