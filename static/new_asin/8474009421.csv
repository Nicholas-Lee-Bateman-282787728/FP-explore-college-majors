Bill Gaither should get the highest award for bringing back this music and singers which was practically sleeping in the 80's 90's thank you Bill, bring us sum more.",1497398400,,496,4.522222222222222

7901127,5,8474009421,"One of the more beautiful gospel songs is When All God's Singers Get Home, the title of this concert studio Homecoming performance.  And, ironically, many of these Homecoming Friends have gone home, J.D. Sumner, The Goodmans, Bob Cain, Hovie Lister, Jake Hess, Brock Speer, Glen Payne, George Younce, Roger Bennett, etc.

What is unique is that with this earlier production, the Friends are singing from the lyrical booklets, versus a teleprompter.  The oldtime Gaither Friends mood is here...., singing, happiness, tears, fun, and the bonding they have with one another.

Many who enjoy the old timers will appreciate something by Bob Cain (1939-2000).  Here, he plays the trumpet in I've Got a New Song to Sing"".  This song was about his newfound faith through music.

I love some of the more upbeat, like ""This Great Caravan Keeps on Rolling""; ""Getting Ready to Leave This World"", Goodby World, Goodby"";  ""Joy Comes in the Morning""; ""What a Lovely Name""; ""Floodstage"".  The Gaither Vocal band sings ""I Shall Wear a Crown""; and Vestal Goodman leads on ""Farther Along"".

There are so many other wonderful songs here, .....  He Will Lead His Children Home; In the Sweet Forever; Did You Ever Go Sailin?; Carry Me;  Greater is He That is in Me;  Led out of Bondage;  Georgia on My Mind; Cryin' Holy Unto the Lord; I Have Decided to Follow Jesus; and The Altar.

If you are looking for an old time Gaither Homecoming Friends performance, filmed in 95/96, but not released on DVD until later.  Nostalgia?  This one is it!.....Rizzo",1322352000,3,1528,4.883268482490273
7901128,4,8474009421,"""When All God's Singers Get Home"" is one of the earlier Homecoming videos in the Gaither Series. After viewing many of the later concerts, it is interesting to note the technical advances we have seen in production as well the mix of intergenerational ages among the artists, performers, as well as in the musical arrangements featured. This production is theme centered as the title suggests.

Stan Witnere's piano solo clearly impressed the Homecoming Friends participating in the studio recording and taping. Artists featured include: Cynthia Clauson, Lynda Randall, The Gaither Vocal Band, Bob Cain, and Jake Hess.

Ken Davis added a comedic note to the evening.  Joni Eareckson shared heartwarming experiences from her spiritual journey and was featured with Vestal Goodman in the song ""Farther Along."" I enjoyed Ray Boltz arrangement of ""The Altar."" Several groups and ensembles rounded out the program. Entertaining and Inspiring.",1306972800,3,937,5.448275862068965
