8243245,5,B001201SA8,"After purchasing and viewing the New York's Biggest Blazes by Steven Spak, I was truly amazed at the quality and content of this DVD. Spectacular shots of some of New Yorks largest multi-alarm fires caught by the video lens of a person well adept in fire department operations.
Anyone who follows fire dept. action will enjoy this video. Also makes a great gift to those working in the fire dept. who would like to remember the times that they once stretched a line or put up a aerial ladder. These pictures will undoubtly go down as historical footage as time goes by. Amazon.com is a good place to aquire these videos.",1237248000,3,620,4.594594594594595
8243246,5,B001201SA8,"I buy this DVD because i'm FDNY fan. When you watch it, you discover, how amazing and dangerous this job could be.

You could visit the city that never sleeps and have a run with the Bravest Fire Department in the country, and the famous all over the world.

I hope other Steve Spak DVD's, and more FDNY will be available soon in Amazon.",1202428800,,337,4.25
