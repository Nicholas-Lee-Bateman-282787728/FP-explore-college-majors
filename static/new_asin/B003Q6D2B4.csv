4166348,3,B003Q6D2B4,"Red is a pretty fun ride from start to finish. It features a great cast, including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary-Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox and Karl Urban. The Expendables is another movie that came out this year with a huge cast, but I never would have thought that these older folks would make for a better action movie.

The humor, which works a little over 50% of the time, and the strong cast are what really makes Red tick. Some of the action scenes are interesting, like when Bruce Willis gets out of a moving car and starts shooting without missing a beat, while others are rather bland. The story felt flat and simple, yet at the same time, all over the place. Still, there is no doubt that for an early fall release, Red proves itself better than most of the average films I've seen this summer.",1287187200,7,873,4.596153846153846
4166349,4,B003Q6D2B4,"RED is the action-comedy about a small group of retired CIA field operatives (Retired, Extremely Dangerous...R.E.D.) who are targeted for elimination by nefarious government groups and must team up to fight off the threat and reveal the culprit.

RED is a silly but very fun movie.  It is the sort of movie that would not work, however, if we didn't already have pretty strong impressions and feelings about its stars.  If we didn't already think of Helen Mirren as the classy actress who won an Oscar for THE QUEEN...we wouldn't laugh simply at the sight of her wielding a machine gun.  If we didn't mostly think of Morgan Freeman for playing God or the President or the silky-toned narrator of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS...we wouldn't chuckle at his antics.  Quite frankly, if you enjoyed the trailers for RED, you'll enjoy the movie.  They give you an almost complete sense of the tone of this film.  If you thought the trailers looked merely silly and made you roll your eyes...then the movie will simply multiply that feeling.

Personally, I thought it was a lot of fun.  The actors are clearly having a ball, and Bruce Willis (who doesn't really come across as old enough to be retired...especially when he can still win fistfights left and right) makes a good host.  He's coasting here, but as movie-goers, we're so comfortable with Willis and his shaved head that it feels a little like we're just visiting an old friend.  Mary Louise Parker (WEEDS) is his sort-of love interest, a call center worker he's been flirting with long distance but who now joins in on the escapades.  She does a nice job evolving from meek to really enjoying the dangerous antics.  Mirren and Freeman are fun.  Brian Cox shows up as a retired Soviet agent, and he sparkles in his over-the-top accent.  Richard Dreyfuss appears in a couple of scenes and chews scenery.  You have to almost feel sorry for Karl Urban as the assassin on Willis' trail...he doesn't get to have much fun...but he acquits himself well.  I can almost envision him doing well as the star of a straight-laced action series on CBS.

Best of all is the hilarious John Malkovich.  He steals every scene he's in with amazing ease.  As the craziest of the REDs, he gets to let his tendencies to overact mightily just run wild...and it all works.  His facial expressions alone had the audience in stitches.

RED is not a classic film by any means.  But I must say, the 110 minutes I spent with these guys was a complete, guilty-pleasure blast.  Maybe I'm just the right age (46) to enjoy this particular cast goofing around...but I sure noticed a lot of happy looking teens and 20-somethings all around me.  I think this film is set up to be a nice little hit (with room for sequels).",1287187200,564,2732,4.653444676409186
4166350,5,B003Q6D2B4,"We loved this movie! I previously rated it 5-stars! We missed it in the theatre and borrowed the Special Edition version from our local library. The SE has some great extras on it!

I have just contacted my 2nd Amazon seller, who sold me a NON-Special Edition copy! No extra features! No problem, you'll get a refund once you return the ""wrong"" version DVD! Yeah, Right! I'm wasting my time (and money) with vendors who don't give a crap whether I get the DVD I ordered or not! No, I don't get all my money back, because I no longer trust these sleazy vendors to claim I even sent their mistaken DVD back! So I end up paying for delivery confirmations!

Buyer Beware! Amazon used to have some decent 3rd party vendors. My experience says otherwise!

Yeah, I purchased two copies of this DVD, but I never got even one, and I'm out money! Screw me very much!",1287187200,15,856,4.405063291139241
4166351,4,B003Q6D2B4,"RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) is an entertaining, slightly off-beat action-comedy about a group of former CIA black ops agents targeted for assassination.

Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) lives the quiet desperation of retired suburban life, his only outlet is a budding phone romance with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) a Federal Pension clerk.  Out of the blue a team of high-tech assassins suddenly comes after him, setting him on the trail to find out why.  Sarah becomes embroiled in the mess from her connection to Frank as he tracks down his old partners Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovic), who are also on the hit list.  To ensure the success of the mission the CIA brings in a rising young star named Cooper (Karl Urban) to complete the job.  Along the way Frank enlists the aid of a former KGB operative Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) and former MI6 asset Victoria (Helen Mirren) to unravel the conspiracy against them, which goes higher than they could have imagined.

The film is based upon the DC Comics graphic novels, which I was unaware of, so I don't how it measures up to the source material.  The script is fun and funny with lots of characterization and backstory to help tie things together.  The little things add up: Frank's trying to connect better with Sarah by reading the same books she does, Frank and Ivan reminiscing about the old days and other small scenes like these help bring it up a notch above the standard fare.  The whole movie is fun and energetic, with the certain level of silliness you'd expect from it, but a couple of times it lands in the wrong places.

The actors were good in their roles but Morgan Freeman's screentime is too brief and Mary-Louise Parker's character reminded too much of Nancy from Weeds.  But they all play off each other very well, and I wasn't expecting the appearances of Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine and James Remar- any of whom are a bonus.

One of the best things about the movie was the music.  A nice mix of Chicago Blues, southern guitar and R&B bass is used for transitions and travel music, and there's a little Aerosmith and some good funky riffs thrown into the action sequences all of which work nicely and sound great.  Go over to the website and you'll hear a couple of riffs: [...] This is a soundtrack I definitely want!

RED is an entertaining popcorn flick with some nice laughs and ok action.  The draw is more in the star power than the story.  Don't expect too much out of it and you'll enjoy it for what it is.  Better than a three but not a four.",1287100800,2,2567,4.616740088105727
4166352,4,B003Q6D2B4,"It's hard to make a good action film. It's even harder to make a good comedy. And it's harder still to tell a story that will not only entertain audiences, but also keep them intrigued. Not only does ""Red"" successfully achieve all three, it also manages to house it within the context of a graphic novel, a notoriously fanboy-exclusive genre. Fanboys will certainly appreciate this film, but so, I believe, will general audiences; apart from being a fun, thrilling comedy caper, it's also a thoroughly absorbing tale of conspiracy, friendship, loyalty, and yes, even romance. It displays a fair share of comic book violence, and yet it never becomes overpowering, so we can simultaneously revel in the stunts and explosions and pay attention to the plot. It's nice to know that even comic adaptations can be made to appeal to everyone and not merely exist in a closed universe.

Adapted from the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, ""Red"" tells the story of four retired CIA agents who have been marked for death. Exactly who wants them dead and why, they don't yet know. It all begins with a former black-ops agent named Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), who, despite his impeccable service record, has been labeled RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous. Up until a team of assassins entered his home, he had been living the quite life in a secluded suburban area. He had started a phone relationship with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), who tries to manage his pension from a cubicle in Kansas City; it proved to be an unwise move, for now she's also a target for assassination. Frank kidnaps her for her own good. She's initially frightened by him, although it very quickly becomes apparent that she gets off by living dangerously. She's also one of the few people outside of his inner circle that can handle his witty banter.

The death of a newspaper reporter leads to the discovery of a long hit list. This, in turn, leads to Frank reuniting with his old teammates: Intelligence specialist Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), who languishes in a New Orleans retirement home; spy and camouflage expert Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), who lives in bomb shelter in Pensacola and, after years of undergoing Russian mind-control experiments, has every reason to be hopelessly paranoid; and Victoria (Helen Mirren), now a domestic Martha Stewart-type in Chesapeake, although she often yearns for her old days as a Wetwork special ops agent, where she was proficient with long range weapons. Together, they work towards uncovering a massive conspiracy, one that connects to an assignment they were a part of years earlier.

On their tails is CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban), who seems to understand his mission less and less the more he learns about Frank and his team. Far from a villainous clich, he's a family man who's dedicated to his job yet does possess the ability to think rationally; he's methodical and cunning, but he's also capable of making mistakes, and the more he realizes what Frank is capable of, the less he's inclined to listen to his superiors and carry out his mission. He also realizes, rather harshly, that both he and Frank have the wherewithal to fight for who they love.

The film deftly manages a balancing act between action violence and comedy, helped in no small part by actors who are quite funny. Malkovich is the obvious example, his character a wacky explosion of goofy dialogue and sheer mental instability. But Willis, Freeman, and Mirren shouldn't be forgotten, here; they too reveal a refreshing sense of humor, mostly in relation to how their characters have adapted - or at the very least, have tried to adapt - to retired life. Credit also to Parker, whose surprisingly realistic dialogue is the perfect counterpart to Willis', which is pleasantly silly. Ironically, it's the mildly serious nature of the story that allows the leads to be so funny; had the film been a nonstop joke fest, had there been not a shred of heavy-handedness, the subtle quirkiness of the characters would not have registered. They simply would have disappeared into the background.

Fortunately, the filmmakers found a way to keep every aspect of the movie engaging. Nothing is left to the sidelines, not even the occasional stunt sequence, each lasting long enough to be entertaining but not going on so long that they become boring. Perhaps the best extra touch is a small but memorable guest appearance by Ernest Borgnine, who at age ninety-three looks, moves, and sounds like an actor twenty, nay, thirty years his junior. As the film's tagline says, ""Still got it."" Everyone involved with this film has got it. 2010 has seen the release of several comic book/graphic novel adaptations I enjoyed, including ""Iron Man 2,"" ""The Losers,"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (I'm conveniently forgetting the deplorable ""Kick-Ass""). ""Red"" is by far the best of them all. It's funny, exciting, and absorbing - a thoroughly entertaining film.",1287100800,2,4954,4.949519230769231
4166353,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Sure, Bruce Willis kicking ass is nothing new but add Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich ""not as a villain for once"" and Helen Mirren kicking ass too and you're in for a good time. While Mary-Louise Parker is adorable and funny as Sarah Ross, who finds herself on a blind-date from hell with Willis' character. Red may overstay it's welcome a little bit, but I enjoyed it and I wish any of the 2010 summer releases were this fun.",1287014400,4,425,4.461538461538462

4166376,3,B003Q6D2B4,"I love the movie.  When I first watched it, I laughed out loud many times, and I hadn't done that during a modern comedy in awhile.  There was also a happy surprise included in that there was a code for a digital redemption included in the case.  I was super excited (because who doesn't like digital copies?) until I went to redeem it... and it was expired (hence the 3 stars instead of 5 - it would've been 2 stars had the case indicated a digital copy was included).  But I didn't actually get a notification saying it was expired, the website just kept popping up an error message stating ""Something went wrong, try again.""  After SEVERAL times retrying (and trying using Vudu's normal digital code redemption page vs the link included on the insert), I decided to give up.  In their defense, the insert does state ""Offer must be redeemed on or before 6/13/2014 or your code will expire.""  But even taking that into account, most digital codes I've redeemed have been a couple of years beyond their expiration dates but were still good.  I've considered contacting the Blu-ray manufacturer, but I know the chances are slim-to-none of getting a valid digital copy redemption code.

To sum up, I LOVE this movie (as stated before).  The movie itself is worth 5 stars, but the lack of a valid digital copy redemption code took it down to 3 stars.",1527292800,,1347,4.598326359832636

But Helen Mirron steals the movie for me when she comes off as probably the baddest one of any of them.  And Mary Louse Parker is very good also.  I always liked her.

4166526,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Red is available for the first time on 4K Ultra HD. Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a former black-ops CIA agent living a quiet life alone until the day a hit squad shows up to kill him. Besides Frank, other retired CIA agents are being targeted by parties unknown. With his identity compromised, Frank reassembles his old team  Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren)  and sets out to prove that they still have the field skills to handle the bad guys.

Director Robert Schwentke strikes an often uneasy balance between strictly action thriller elements and broad humor, but overall, the film is fun, especially when Dame Helen Mirren appears long into the film to perk things up. Seeing her handle a 50-caliber machine gun is a hoot. Mary Louise Parker stars as Sarah Ross, the telephone contact charged with ensuring that Franks pension checks arrive on time.

The film is available for the first time on 4K Ultra HD, which provides over four times the resolution of full HD and delivers the brightest, most vivid and truest color with the greatest contrast. The 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release also features Dolby Vision and Dolby immersive audio, providing a theatrical experience for home viewing.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Red 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray release include audio commentary with retired CIA field officer Robert Baer, and deleted and extended scenes.",1504656000,,1411,5.012820512820513

4166537,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Just finished watching ""Red"" released by Summit Entertainment.
Based on the graphic novel published by DC, ""Red"" is a fun cross country romance adventure about Frank Moses, a retired CIA Black OPS Specialist who is trying to fit into retirement by living quietly in suburbia, while trying to work up the courage to ask the young lady who works for the US Department of Pensions as a Customer Service Representative out on a date - he speaks to her once a month, deliberately tearing his pension checks in half so that he can have an excuse to call her.
Moses then wakes up one night as intruders break into his house late one night with the intent to kill him.  He takes them out and immediately goes on the run.  Someone is trying to kill him and Moses must rescue his potential girlfriend before she becomes collateral damage.
""Red"" is a light-hearted spy rump that also does double duty as a romantic comedy.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

He need to have one of those ""Christmas Past Experience "" and enjoy his job and not worry about how much more he should make. I still enjoyed this flick.  I think the getting old and being tired unless were fighting seemed a little too much. At some point I didn't want to hear that end of the story....Were Old..the joke was made..This isn't on the actors but the script..John Malkovich gets the best lines and has the most fun..being the result of allot of drug testing. The Bill Murray to the Dan Aykroyd formula. I would love to watch these actors redo movies in the age there out now..Back to the Future with the ""Red"" cast. .I like the cheesy effect of the post card for traveling distance,this tell you the film takes risks.  Karl Urban did a great job..the odd way he talks..I think it is to hide his true accent is interesting.  It is a good ride on this CIA party train.",1490054400,,950,4.320224719101123

I watched the whole thing again because my wife was watching it with me, and had never seen it. The acting was very good, and the characters were interesting and consistent. It's the story I didn't like. It starts with, like, ten guys with machine guns cutting a house in half with their gunfire; and this is in a pleasant little hunk of suburbia at Christmas. And it ends with Hellen Mirren's character firing a 50 caliber machine gun, mounted on a tripod, at a whole bunch of U.S. Secret Servicemen. That's too stupid, for me.",1477958400,,626,4.405172413793103

However, the sexist, macho plot made me turn it off without finishing it. The only woman I saw who was over 40 was a depicted in a very unfavorable light. The young side-kick for Bruce Willis creates some chemistry but is half his age or less. So, women are washed-up and have no value if they are over 40 and not beautiful?

4166840,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Love it! It took me about 40 minutes to pick a bleeping movie and I trust Rotten Tomatoes. Never felt lost in the whole entire narrative. Just such believable quirky characters. One surely doesn't slowdown in there 50's or 60's. I can't give away any plot points. Instead I'll drop covert ops, wet work whatever it's called-it's way better OLD school style. You'll know what I mean at the end with Marvin, he leads three men into a trap.

I'm 25 and Latina this movie can definitely be enjoyed by any crime thriller fan.",1470268800,,520,4.531914893617022

This is not a high-budget movie, still, if you sit through the first twenty minutes,
You will probably finish the film.

RED is a spy comedy / action thriller. It is somewhat in bad taste, but then playing it safe never
Gets a movie anywhere.

A retired CIA operative is marked for death, as is the woman he loves. Just watch the rest of the film.

4166991,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Very entertaining movie.  John Malkovich steals pretty much every scene he's in.  Bruce Willis is excellent, as well as Helen Mirren. Morgan Freeman has a limited amount of screen time, but talent for acting always comes out when he's involved.  Mary-Louise Parker was an excellent choice for her part, as she does it so very well.  Next to John Malkovich, my favorite character in this was the part of the Russian official played by Brian Cox.  Just the right amount of character dialog can make major differences in the flow of the movie, and screenwriters got this part just right.  Mr. Cox takes full advantage.",1456704000,,615,4.809523809523809

4167010,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Willis in one of his best! RED stands for Retired, Extremely Dangerous, at least is does in this story about a former CIA operative. He led a mission into a latin country to rescue a big-wig's son and now only Willis and three others remain alive out of ten members. Mary-Louise Parker steals much of the film as a government pension coordinator whom Willis treats as a love interest... that is after he drugs and ties her up because she's not reacting how he wants. Picture her tied to a headboard of a bed in a small motel. She breaks loose and calls the cops. But the cops turn out to be looking for Willis. Malkovich is excellent as a conspiracy theorist who lives his fears. Morgan Freeman is another retiree who has to kill an assassin right after a visit from Willis. Helen Mirren romps through the story as a retired MI6 agent who had to kill her Russian lover. Brian Cox plays her supposedly dead lover and Karl Urban is the CIA agent charged with killing Willis.

No one can give a good rant like John Malkovich's LSD-addled character and Morgan Freeman is excellent as his sane, rational counterpart.

Retired Extremely Dangerous (aka RED) is a cute comedy and made especially cute by Mary Louise Parker from ""Weeds"" as Bruce Willis's girlfriend he kidnaps on the first date. It is afterall a CIA based comedy. Don't know why this isn't available on NetFlix and on that point NetFlix sure does limit the content quality of their online styreaming service. It makes me wonder if it isn't a not so subtle nudge to add the mail option which effectively doublesthe price? But back on point: RED is a great movie from 2011 :)",1447718400,,576,4.495238095238095

Overlong and sloppily edited, the film offers an engaging set up and some neat action beats, but it's charms have worn thin by the time Helen Mirren pops up an hour in, and have positively evaporated by the time the film itself wheezes to a conclusion an hour after that.

Older people are going to like it more than young people but hey isn't great that there is a film that isn't directed towards teenagers, isn't full of soft porn, has  witty dialogue, good plot and super  funny from start to finish. And Bruce Willis
s love although younger is as funny as the seasoned actors and actresses are. Love the Red series. Hope they do more before the actors and actresses get ill or die off. It was great. Red 2 was great also. Another Red 3 please.
I like Bure Willis. He saves the world and does it with a touch of humor.

Helen Mirren is delightful as the assassin. My teens didn't know who Richard Dreyfuss is, but really enjoyed his performance. They still quote his lines from the movie.

4167496,3,B003Q6D2B4,"I'd give it only 1 star for wasting the superb Morgan Freeman, who has enormously more to offer than he's allowed to provide in most roles (cf. his stellar ""buddy"" performance as Azim the Moor in Costner's Robin Hood remake, where his humor and expressive power are allowed to shine).

But aside from the horrible waste of Freeman, I found this to be a 5-star film, so I had to compromise.

Helen Mirren is her usual superb self.

Malkovich plays his paranoid character for laughs, but real paranoia isn't funny at all, nor are its sufferers.

Willis, of course, is always Willis in much the same way that other well-known actors (e.g. Alan Rickman) always play themselves.  It's hard to argue with success.",1425686400,,707,4.715447154471545

4167645,3,B003Q6D2B4,"This film bears so little resemblance to the graphic novel that they should have not kept the title. But that's Hollywood for you, no respect for Droit Moral at least where the right of integrity of the original work, which was a dark and poignant tale of loyalty and sacrifice betrayed, is concerned. Sure the original work was way too short to sustain a full-length film but any extension to the story could have been consistent with the original mood and in that way the colossal plot holes in the movie might have been avoided. Robert Baer's commentary was a little painful to listen to and I hope they gave him a big, fat cheque for his time - he must have really needed the money.
On the positive side of the ledger, it is a really enjoyable romp with a fine cast who never needed to get out of first gear so effortless were their performances. Just remember to turn your brain off.",1419292800,,888,4.420731707317073

And no ""older"" woman handles a gun like Helen Mirren!  You'll love it!  Oh, the DVD ""extras"" were the MAIN reason I got this.  It gives TRUE STORIES of several instances of the CIA ""behaving badly"" (for decades), in documents that are now declassified.  Some of them were rather shocking and very sad (although not entirely surprising).  It's just annoying to see countries around the world ruined for no good reason (or for reasons based on greed and sheer stupidity).",1418774400,,634,4.598214285714286

It just got too painful. Horrible

4167897,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Given like for movies/shows are so individual, I generally do not write reviews for movies. But this is one of my favorite movies so I just have to. To give you an idea of my personal tastes, I like action movies and I like comedies. I find movies with neurotic characters to be hilarious. RED is about as ridiculous as it gets. It has neurotic. It has a whole lot of psychotic. It has a ton of action. It's filled with both direct, implied, and neurotic humor. And it actually has a plot which in and of itself is interesting beyond the action and comedy sequences.

As many awesome reviews here talk about the movie itself in detail, I am going to focus on just a few aspects and not at a level of detail that would give away how the movie works. Specifically, I am going to focus on some of the characters and how they relate to the plot.

The characters chosen could not have been better. Obviously any movie can have an ""all-star"" cast, but how well the cast brings the movie to life really depends on if the actresses and actors excel in roles played in that specific kind of movie. Here it was done flawlessly.

Bruce Willis is known for his action, perhaps first made legendary in Die Hard. In more recent movies like the Expendables 2, his action has merged with comedy (for example, him and Arnold Schwarzenegger driving around in an electric golf cart shooting a small army of bad guys while simultaneously complaining about old age and talking trash). Willis has the neuroticism you want from someone playing this role, but with the ability to deliver in the 'kick ass' department that you need for an action movie. So for the main character, he's golden.

But that isn't enough to make a good cast given it takes more than one character. Needing someone capable of taking neurotic to (and beyond) psychotic, John Malkovich is perhaps the best actor for this job and delivers solid deadpan neuroticism you can't help but laugh at. And while all the characters are pretty neurotic, he is by far the most and one of the comedic reliefs in the film. His excess of neuroticism and intense paranoia make him a strong comedic relief in a movie that is, largely, already funny (and that's often difficult to do, and when done poorly, can really detract from the movie.)

Morgan Freeman (arguably one of the greatest actors in history) is capable of filling almost any acting role and he does so perfectly here. Mary-Louise Parker is the other comedic relief in the film. While the least psychotic of the characters, she brings a different kind of awkward, mismatched, and suggestive humor that the other characters do not, and the movie itself would not be nearly as funny without her. Like some of her other acting roles, there is a lot of applied humor. Karl Urban does a good job at the wildcard. His seriousness contrasts the seriousness of the other characters, and his interactions with the other main characters makes them more funny. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox bring very unique roles and have very good on-screen-chemistry that matches the ridiculousness of the movie rather than being serious to a point where it overshadows the base insanity that defines RED. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker is also excellent. All of the romance adds to the action and the comedy, without pushing the movie on a drama path.

The plot in and of itself is actually interesting, and this is where many action movies (and especially action-comedies) tend to fall short on. It maintains a story line that in itself as not ridiculous in a fashion that the characters are, and it orders the events in a fashion in which you actually know what the film is doing, where it is progressing, but without being able to predict the outcome ahead of time. You won't have a ""what the heck just happened?"" moment or a ""15 minutes in, I knew what was going to happen and it did.""

The special effects in and of themselves are pretty awesome. Like most bigger budget action flicks, you won't be disappointed here.

Overall, I really like the movie and can watch is time after time. If you like this style movie, I think you will find it to be entertaining to a level of excess in ridiculousness with a degree of humorous neuroticism that few movies can match.",1408492800,,4266,4.618733509234828

4167899,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Bruce Willis supported by an all-star cast including, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Miren and more.  Bruce Willis is CIA agent who joined by friends in the business seek to bring down a gun smuggler played by Richard Dreyfuss.  Storyline is average, but it doesnt matter as the action pretty much takes care of the movie.  Red 2 the sequel is just as good and is one of the few franchaises that holds up through both movie #1 and #2. I highly recommend it and it is definitely a don't miss movie.",1408406400,,504,4.456521739130435

This is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by everyone from 8 to 80. It has a love story for the women, action for the men and laughs for everyone in between.",1404518400,,436,3.9101123595505616

Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovitch, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Mary Louise Parker... wow what a cast !
RED= 'Retired & Extremely Dangerous' formerly CIA people. The retirees are superb in getting 'the bad guys'. Helen matter of factly tosses out lots of one liners as she shoots the bad guys (sometimes wearing white outfit). Gee that's going to leave a stain?

the violence isn't graphic or intense. OK movie for 13-14 yr olds.",1404259200,,463,4.860759493670886

This is a great action-comedy. The action is unrealistic, but intentionally so; it's meant to be far-fetched. Lots of funny dialogue. Great characters. In fact, the villain is just as likeable as the heroes!

CONS:
Frank's girl slows down the tempo too much; I wonder why she is even there. She can't shoot, she can't fight, and she spends a lot of time complaining about Frank and the way he does things.

American movies always have to shove the girlpower thing down our throats, so I've come to expect it and just ignore it. If you understand that the action is intended to be comic book-like, and if you can ignore the girlpower lectures, you will enjoy this film.",1404000000,,674,4.608333333333333

It wasn't an edge of the seat thriller, but we were just looking for something without nudity and excessive bad language. While there is some language concerns, overall it was mild by today's standards. We liked the tongue in cheek humor scattered throughout the movie and the overall plot was appropriate for aging actors. Red does contain a lot of shooting and killing. If that's something you look to avoid, then this movie isn't for you.

It is like they took a screwball romantic comedy and an action adventure comedy that is somehow also serious and perfectly combined them.

I love how the young people think it will be a piece of cake to takeout the older ones. It is so fun to root for the underdogs. The opening part just cracks me up, Bruce Willis life as a bachelor. How anybody could live that boring and own a gun and not shoot themselves in the head is beyond me. It just cracks me up every time.

4168357,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This is a brilliantly funny action movie with very wide appeal. I couldn't resist adding my superlatives to the long list of positive reviews, especially since I have watched this DVD recently for the third time. Even the extra features are interesting!

All the main players are in top form and their obvious chemistry adds so much to the generally upbeat mood. They are having a ball and not taking themselves too seriously, while poking fun at a series of events which are both topical and credible. We learn from the extras that an ex-CIA agent oversaw the production and it shows!

The story begins with a look at the life of early retiree Frank Moses (Bruce Willis at his sardonic best), and it is immediately clear that this freakishly neat, mild-mannered man has secret depths. He calls to complain about his pension payment being late, but this is a blatant excuse to chat up his caseworker (competently portrayed by Mary-Louise Parker). It becomes clear that, despite their age difference, they have both been enjoying these conversations for some time and soon, with some misgivings, she agrees to meet Frank in real life.

From here on, the action takes off as Frank's past catches up with him and, facing mortal danger, he is forced to re-assemble a team of his former associates.

John Malkovich gives an unforgettable performance as a mentally-damaged but still sharp former CIA operative (I'm getting the PIG); Helen Mirren is equally fantastic as the gun-toting ex-spy who is unable to make a complete transition to her new life as the suave hostess of a luxury guest house (I take the odd contract on the side. I just can't stop.). Brian Cox is priceless in the role of a love-sick Russian agent and manages to steal many scenes (But you didn't come just for the vodka). Morgan Freeman is both touching and hilarious and Karl Urban deals expertly with his conflicted character. Ernest Borgnine brings a life-weary, seen-it-all, deep humanity in a superb cameo appearance. I could go on, as there isn't a weak performance in this whole movie and the stunts and special effects are nothing less than spectacular.

The movie moves along at a lively pace and there are surprises right up to the end. This is a true comedy, a rare gem in a wasteland of hyped-up funny films that simply aren't amusing, to me anyway, and I have enjoyed it more each time I have watched it.",1397520000,,2384,4.748792270531401

4168361,3,B003Q6D2B4,"A three star to me is one that I will not watch again. It is too slow and not a real good plot. No suspense and no real emotion development to hate the villains. I generally love Bruce Willis movies but he has had some lemons. This is not one of the lemons but it is not one that I rate a 4 star so I will watch it again. Even the other stars seemed to try to create a reason for their role. Over acting is worse than bad acting. They were pushing that. However, Nicolas Cage and Al Pacino are the masters of overacting. John and Morgan were pushing it to create a reason to be there.",1397433600,,584,3.9159663865546217

and you will be delighted. Bruce Willis , a retired Govt
agent is targeted for execution as a witness to some
high level political crime. He gathers his old time collegues
into harness in order to put and end to the bad guys,
which of course they do. The romantic sub plot is Willis's
girl friend who gets picked up on the way, initially outraged
to find out who he is she eventually gets to love the excitement",1396828800,,465,4.177777777777778

It is a star-studded cast which I think may actually hamper the story just a bit because it seems like the director is bent on giving each star their ""allotted screen time"" instead of focusing solely on the story.  Still, action-packed.  WIllis is great but Malkovich MAKES this movie.",1396483200,,349,4.596774193548387

4168459,4,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie was unexpectedly good. Typical Bruce Willis movie and Morgan Freeman. With classic, John Malkohvich, as witty as always. Mary-Louise Parker has a sexy innocence about her and Helen Mirren was awesomely violent.",1396224000,,221,5.529411764705882

4168475,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This film has all the cliches and yet it is tremendous fun, and I loved all the characters, including the brain-dead Sarah Ross/Mary-Louise Parker.  Bruce Willis/Frank Moses tries to play sentimental - but you understand his position.  John Malkovich is brilliantly quirky, and Victoria Winslow/Helen Mirren is wonderful skillful and elegant, and Morgan Freeman/Joe Matheson is calculating and clever.  I enjoyed the movie in the theater and I liked it just as much on DVD.  There aren't too bad or boring or redundant scenes.  Admittedly it's not greatness, but it is wonderfully enjoyable, and I was thoroughly entertained.",1396051200,,625,5.336734693877551

A couple of advanced age actors who are trying to make a buck with their old successes. Nothing wring with that. It does have entertainment value and good humor.,1395100800,,277,4.673469387755102

1. It isn't cerebral.
2. It has no political message.
3. It has no social relevance.
4. It will not raise your consciousness for any cause.

4168665,2,B003Q6D2B4,"A friend thought I might like this... I guess because I'm older and so are the stars of this over the top ""action adventure love story""  They must have used every weapon of every type and every swat-style uniform and gear available in the Hollywood prop lockers in putting this fiasco together. Lots of machine guns, car crashes, and all the other things these types of films usually have. Some nice locations and the production values are very good. The storyline is implausible at best, about a group of retired CIA agents now targeted by the corrupt vice president who is a puppet of a bad guy business man who is at the bottom of this sometimes slap stick, sometimes soapy, always loud way to waste an evening. Anyhow the geriatric guys manage to fight off hundreds of buff young current CIA soldiers and agents in various settings and eventually kill off all the bad guys and win the girls. Surprise, surprise.

I understand this movie was successful and that a second one was made.  I for sure won't be watching it.",1392595200,,1021,4.5989010989010985

4168671,4,B003Q6D2B4,"The baby boomer adventure movie to end all boomer adventure movies (you can practically hear Willis, Mirrin, Freeman, and Malkovich yelling, ""Take that, generation Y! We're still vital and relevant!!!"" as the credits roll) the premise of this movie is that spies might be retired, but they are still plenty dangerous. It's a fun idea, executed competently, if not especially brilliantly. Willis gets to play a slightly edgier version of his rogue cop role, a la Die Hard; Malkovich gets to be wacky; Mirrin gets to be classy (and British, of course); and Freeman gets to be wry. Mary Louise Parker serves as the romantic interest, playing a more midwestern version of her Nancy Parker (Weeds) character.

The plot is straightforward, and everything hinges on the star power of the cast. Since they're all strong actors, it mostly works. If you have a family gathering, with grandparents and kids and parents all itching to watch a movie - this is a good choice. Nothing offensive, but nothing too juvenile, either.

This isn't intended to be a negative review - movies like this one are hard to find. There's precious little out there that's good for older kids (think late elementary school through middle school) and also palatable for adults.

This cast seemed to be having as much fun as we were watching it.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and the incomparable Helen Mirren as you've never seen her before are all RED (retired, extremely dangerous) agents. Someone doesn't want them around anymore, and that's where the fun (and lots of violence) begins. Mary Louise Parker is the innocent who gets drawn into the middle of it all. This kept our interest and made us smile - it is nonstop thrills, nonstop fun and pure entertainment.  Buy it, pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy a good time.  Then buy Red2 for their next adventure.",1390003200,,743,4.394160583941606

The plot is very simple, good guys versus bad guys, although the good guys are on shaky ground.  The cast does a wonderful job of hamming it up.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirrim, and John Malkovich, just enjoy themselves.  Sure the ending is preposterous, so what, this type of film demands that type of ending, for it to work out.  No one is taking themselves seriously in this film, and that makes it fun to watch, the viewer does not have to look for deep meanings, or redeeming social lessons.  Take my advice, and just enjoy it for what it is, a great put-on.  I recommend it for the smiles and laughs you'll get out of it.  JRV",1389312000,,740,4.235714285714286

This is an incredible film that captivated my interest despite me having a sense of what was going to happen to the main characters, i.e., most of them make it to the sequel. Great action scenes, sensible plot, good dialogue, and characters you grew to care about makes this an enjoyable movie to watch. Glad I own it, which I debated whether to purchase or rent, because I intend to watch it multiple times.

Also  check out  THE JACKAL  with  Bruce Willis,  or the original one  THE DAY OF THE JACKAL from 1973 (which is based on historical events).  BOTH are also great espionage movies.

UPDATE - has an extra feature.  Interview with a ""spy"".

All the actors were able to perform in every aspect ( comedy, drama, action, deadpan, etc.) and carried off an entirely believable script. I loved every minute of it and could not wait to order RED2. I just got it in the mail. Really, I had to stop typing to accept it from the mailman. I shared RED with others in my apartment building and they all wanted to know when I was ordering the next installment. Having so many well known and respected actors in one film makes for a great watching experience. Thank you.

The guy is amazing and still extremely entertaining after all these years. There wasn't a scene in this movie in which I wasn't entertained. Loved the characters. Loved the acting although, I wasn't a fan of RED's GF. That would be my only gripe. I just thought she did a sub par acting job. In contrast, the English woman secret agent (I should know their names) did an incredible job and I absolutely adored her character/talents. She radiates charisma!

Anyways, I think this is great but I know better than to try and convince other people about things. I get all tangled up in what I'm trying to say. But if you liked the trailer well you won't be disappointed by the film. I'm sure I'm not the only one who loved a trailer but hated the movie.

I'm not a huge fan of Bruce Willis but when this movie came to the $3 theater near where I used to live, we saw it twice! Great mix of action and comedy! I love Helen Mirren's character and John Malkovich is super funny! If you see this and love it, you have to get RED 2! It is just as good, if not better, than the first and it stars Anthony Hopkins!",1386460800,,420,3.895348837209302

I wouldn't hesitate to allow my 10 year old grandson, with a little explanation, to see it, but it is also extremely entertaining for Grams and Gramps.  All the main actors are exceptional in this comedy/action movie.  I'd gladly see it again whenever we want to see a light hearted movie with a lot of ""fire power.""

BTW,  it was the first one we saw using Roku which I really think is a great idea.",1386288000,,437,4.280487804878049

4169006,5,B003Q6D2B4,"A movie that does not take it self seriously.  Nothing worse than a movie that tries to be serious and funny at the same time.  e.g. Jeff Goldbum in Jerkasic Park.  One stupid one-liner after another.

Yes, this movie had one-liners but they were well placed and flowed with the movie.  Take notice Jeff Goldbum.",1386201600,,312,4.6
4169007,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Red is great popcorn fun that I think you will enjoy.  The movie stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, and very funny John Malkovich.  The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan.  The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis) is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah (Mary-Louis Parker).  Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous.

I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too.

4169022,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Exciting and suspenseful, but the comedy aspect of the movie is out of step with the violence and killing depicted. This must be the new generation of action comedies. It could only receive five stars from someone over 30 with the mentality of a 12-year-old.

The director had a neat visual style, the actors kept the ham to just a slice each. Malkovich steals the movie, not surprisingly. Bloody, action packed and violently funny. Morgan Freeman was a bit underused.

Good popcorn action flick. Looking forward to sequel. Well worth $1.99. Git ONNIT!

Some of the scenes are spot on he said as far as authenticity, some make believe. He never bashes the film though. What I liked was that he was pretty forward about CIA techniques, how to pick locks, trail someone, kill someone with a pencil, and how to travel light when on missions.

There have been other films that gather a strong star cast but either a really week story or lack of chemistry doesn't work. This is not the case here . The premise is pretty simple : Someone is starting to take out retired Black Op agents , a reporter , helicopter pilot. You can tell the cast is just having a great time playing out the story .  Bruce Willis still kicks ass but is really just wanting a regular life after retiring 2 years earlier . Mary Ellen Parker is fun as his love interest who loves spy stories and then unwittingly gets caught up with the old gang. Morgan Freeman is as easy going as ever. John Malcovich really shines as a superb former Op who still approaches the world with healthy paranoia. Watch his facial expressions - priceless. Helen Mirren : Classy and no nonsense and her former Russian agent lover re entering her life is fun. They all work well together trying to figure out who's after them and then take care of it. Or as Malcovitch says after one of the multiple attempts on their  lives "" old man my ass"" . The lead CIA agent refers to Willis as "" Grampa"" despite Willis out maneuvering him at each turn . Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss have small but fun parts. Definitely worth buying .",1383955200,,1293,4.360995850622406

Lackluster performance on the part of the writers. And what was with all the heavy guns?! That was stupid! Freeman makes a slightly long cameo appearance, just for the billboard, I guess. John was excellently cast, though. Two thumbs up on that. The love story with the Russian was as predictable as beans causing gas! Was glad to NOT see any passionate love-making between Willis and the chick. Trans-generational relationships are just kind of, well, a stretch. Did like the scene when Bruce stepped out of the moving partol car and opened fire on the bad guy (who turns out to be a good guy - Ooops! Spoiler!)

I was a bit skeptical about it, but rented it anyway. I'm a fan of Morgan Freeman from his early days on The Electric Company, and Helen Mirren. This film didn't disappoint me. Freeman and Mirren are great and aptly cast here. Mirren has you believing she is the character portrays. Story has it that during filming of this one she was so believable cast members were a bit leery of her. Now that is good acting. But, hey, she's British and British trained and when it comes to acting, they know what they are doing.

Okay job on not having so many guns with unlimited ammunition, showing belt fed guns or more frequent mag changes, but still unrealistic deployment of some of the weapons (RPG, grenade launcher).  In addition, I was uncomfortable with the ""good guys"" shooting at CIA, FBI, Secret Service, and Police Officers; why would we commend killing likely innocent service men of our country.",1382400000,,563,4.804123711340206

An all-star cast led by, Willis, Malkovich, Freeman and others will have you laughing so hard you'll have to watch it again just to watch the parts you missed while laughing so hard.

4169196,4,B003Q6D2B4,Red is a belly laugh a minute and I cant believe they got away with that. The idiot that critiqued as a slow geriatric grind should be fired and not allowed to critique movies any longer.

And as he becomes vice President, old colleagues from Guatemala start being popped off. Enter our bunch of gnarled old wood. They won't stand for it, ergo - mayhem ensues. Malkovich is fun as the paranoid with a drug-fried brain, Bruce is.. well.. Bruce.. Morgan Freeman is .. well... Morgan Freeman. Mary-Louise Parker is no spring-chicken anymore, but her romance with 89 year old Willis still stretches credibility and becomes alittle silly. I like her though! The Crowning glory, as always, is Helen Mirren, who could act circles around all of them, and plays in a by turns big (what dialogue..!) and understated role.

As the plot moved along, it just seemed disjointed, and even though it was a comedy, they seemed too hard to make it believable, and not succeeding at it.

Still good for some laughs.",1379980800,,248,4.276595744680851

John Malkovich is wonderful as Rain Man meets Get Smart, and I think I fell in love with Helen Mirren; even though I saw her years ago as DCI Tenison in Prime Suspect, I never saw her as attractive or even particularly female til now.

Cant wait for RED2.

It wasn't horrible, but once you have to say that about a movie, well, that's certainly not an endorsement.  Usually Bruce Willis can carry a movie but the whole thing was uninspired. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars.  If they let you choose halves, it would have 2 /12.  The Last Stand - Arnold's newest movie of this same genre was much better, and Karl Urban was much better in Dredd, also same genre, so I recommend this only as a last resort.",1379289600,,543,4.4

I will be going to the theater to see Red2.",1378944000,,298,3.966666666666667

4169320,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren; how could you go wrong!!

  I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis, but he's really good in this.  I've always liked Morgan Freeman, but fell in love with him in this role.  Malkovich simply doesn't make a movie in which he is anything less than fantastic and his interplay with every actor in this just plain makes this a movie you don't want to miss.  As for Helen Mirren, there's no female actor who can play any role better and she doesn't let us down here.  This woman's talent is amazing!

  Mary Louise Parker has never made a big impression on me, but she really holds her own with the powerhouses I spoke of above.

  If you want to have fun watching a movie with lots of action, daredevil stunts and a really good script while still managing to not take itself too seriously, I can't recommend ""Red"" highly enough.",1378857600,,882,4.4375

It's your typical super-agent genre, featuring highly trained (former) operatives with insane levels of skills and abilities and some humor thrown in for good measure.  This movie is cut from the same cloth as ""This Means War"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" or TV's ""Burn Notice"" so, if you like those, there's a good chance that you'll like this.",1378857600,,501,4.544444444444444

These aging spies put James Bond to shame with their ability to divine the nature of the machinations surrounding them and respond with measures to achieve their ultimate goal and not simply escape from the immediate trouble.

4169334,4,B003Q6D2B4,"First off, I like all the stars in this movie and I wasn't disappointed in the entertainment they provided. I had forgotten I'd seen this movie before but it was still fun to watch again. The violence is no where graphic to the point of being disgusting but you definitely get the point that these people know how to use a weapon.

4169338,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Probably the surprise hit of the year at the time, it combines Light Humor with Dark, stamps it mark on every spy spoof and blends characters better than many of the ""Big Budget"" films.  Bruce Willis is perfect, but John Malkovich steals any scene he is in, and plays the paranoid/schizophrenic/pentagon-experiment-gone-wrong to a tee!  Can you help but feel that Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are really spies?  I could go on and on about Morgan Freeman, Richard Dreyfuss and the rest of cast who are either directed to perfection and are enjoying playing together.  Absolutely entertaining in a way most films are not.  A bit violent without being too bloody, or even violent for violence's sake  it is merely the silliness of excess violence that makes it fun.  No one gets hurt in the filming of this movie  except for the competition!  Not quite as silly as the original ""Casino Royale"" (David Niven, Woody Allen), it manages to entertain to the max.  You might say I could even recommend it...  But don't tell anyone.",1378598400,,1020,4.771428571428571

4169340,5,B003Q6D2B4,I love all the actors in this movie.  It was great to be able to see them all in ONE movie together.  The action is great.  And they make the out of the ordinary seem as ordinary and nothing special in ones life.,1378512000,,212,3.883720930232558

4169342,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Nicely surprised by RED - starring Bruce Willis (smirk firmly in place) as Frank Moses, a middle-aged guy in suburbia, living on a pension, who keeps calling the pension office to lie about his monthly checks not arriving because he has a bit of a crush on customer service rep Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). Sarah is bored and lonely and wanting adventure in her life ... and gets more than she could ever hope for when someone from Frank's past sends a battalion of commando-like assassins to kill him - the bad guys going after Sarah, in turn, as she's been the only person Frank has contacted in some time! Frank, forced to sort of kidnap Sarah just to rescue her, goes on the run, but is soon forced back into his old ""line of work"" when he has to put together his team of deadly agents from the past - all of them now classified as ""RED"" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) - to stay alive and find out just what the hell is going on.

I really enjoyed this film, filled with action and suspense but also humor. John Malkovich, the brilliant Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Karl Urban, and Richard Dreyfuss round out one hell of a supporting cast, and even with a slightly hokey ending this is still an enjoyable romp that provides both thrills and laughs. Hope the sequel works as well!",1378512000,,1283,4.506437768240343

I think for we older adults that if you loved these actors in their younger days then you will love them here. Bruce Willis was his usual dry wit and Mary Louise - brilliant! I thought the dialogue was funny, loved 'the pig' and the plot was expected but still good. And, let's face it, anything with Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis will be good.

To be honest, I was probably biased against seeing this film as I thought ""These guys are old, how well can they do action?""  After seeing it, I can truthfully say, they do action quite well thank you.  In addition, they are all fine actors (ok, you have a point with Willis) that seem to be having fun and are into what they are doing.

Most people are not reviewing the MOVIE itself, they are reviewing the DVD quality, the delivery format and speed....Errrr.  THAT is not rating the MOVIE!!! Take those complaints elsewhere!! This has to be in my top 5 movies of all time....quite possibly number 1.  If you have a sense of humor, a sense of romance, a love for excitement and danger....and IF you are NOT one of THOSE people who critique every single moment, just looking for a flaw, ANY flaw(you KNOW the type); if you just enjoy the movie for what it IS and for what it was MEANT TO BE....you, too, will become a Red fan!!!!",1377388800,,821,4.46

4169492,5,B003Q6D2B4,"For whatever reason, I've always found Bruce Willis to be at his best when he is playing the droll super-hero.  Such is the case in ""Red"" and I thought this was one of his better movies of the recent past.  Granted, I say this without having seen a lot of his more current releases.

In this particular case, the movie is a bit slow to develop and you are wondering what's supposed to happen.  Needless to say, as with all action movies, what does take place is not always plausible; and, in this case, as the story develops there are a lot of complexities which are difficult to piece together and which raise a lot of questions which somehow suddenly get answered at the end.  That said, the movie is a fun ""jaunt"" with a lot of action.  I can't wait for the video release of ""Red2"".",1377129600,,785,4.3061224489795915

4169494,1,B003Q6D2B4,"I didn't mind the movie, that's a question of individual taste, but my experience with the video service on amazon is no different than others. I absolutely hate that I can't store my own movie, which I pay full freight for, in a native file on my drive for use on projectors, or whatever other medium I chose. I recognize that the regulation is largely driven by the content owners and AMZN has little to do with it, but I feel a bit like someone sold me a dvd but told me that I can only watch it on Sony TV's. In 2013, that's absurd. Lets get it together guys. Until these services become less closed, I'll continue to rip my own DVD's into digital copies that I can enjoy with ease.",1377129600,,686,4.204545454545454

4169527,4,B003Q6D2B4,"That in 2013 RED 2 is being released pretty much sums up my thoughts of this film.  Where the premise is about retired government assassins being hunted down and joining together to protect each other, themselves had me thinking this was going to be some extreme action flick, particularly with Bruce Willis as one of its stars.  Instead it was one of the funnier films I've seen Willis in and his co-stars, all of whom I expect for more dramatic roles, made it even more pleasant:  Helen Mirren (adore her work), Morgan Freeman (plays God often enough, he must be a close friend and still can give us the drama and the laughs he did much earlier in his career), John Malcovich.  The name alone tells you you're going to get a great performance from a great actor.  Here he plays the ""off"" a little character, again, but unforgettably.  And refreshing to the cast is Mary-Louise Parker.  Caught up in the adventure by being in the right place at the wrong time.  Sure, there's action, but there's award winners ""playing"" as much as working and I found the film a complete delight.  I look forward to actually seeing its sequel, and I'm not a huge fan of sequels (exception may be the Willis Die Hard series of films).",1376870400,2,1217,4.545871559633028

We frankly liked the second movie better as they took more advantage of the actors and made their characters a bit more multi-dimensional (Referencing John Malkovich's character in particular). That being said, if you are a fan of the shoot 'em up and blow 'em up genre, I would think that you would enjoy this little gem. How can you go wrong with this cast, really! The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones, Anthony Hopkins and Lee Byung-hun to the sequel was icing on the cake, and they made the whole thing a lot funnier!",1376697600,,589,4.462962962962963
4169552,3,B003Q6D2B4,Thought it would be fun slow In parts to the point of boring more action and 30 min short it might have been better.,1376697600,,116,3.875
4169553,4,B003Q6D2B4,Red is fun. Not much plot but a lot of fun watching old favorites work together once again. Well worth the price.,1376611200,,113,4.181818181818182
4169554,5,B003Q6D2B4,"An explosive, action packed film with a great cast surrounded with humor.
It starts off a little slow in the beginning but draws you into the action rather quickly after that.
I found it to be very entertaining, it was well worth the rental and I will probably purchase it in the near future.

5 Stars",1376611200,,301,4.375

4169557,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I like Bruce Willis in pretty much anything, but his character in the Die Hard's and the rest of his tough guy movies is so much fun. The rest of the cast in this movie is equally awesome. Can't wait to see RED 2.",1376611200,,213,3.8636363636363638

Lots of plot twists.  You'll love it!  Then when you've finished watching it, go watch Red 2, which is even better!  Imagine that!  A sequel that's better than the first one!",1376611200,,339,4.516666666666667

4169562,3,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie was less serious than I expected, but fun for those of you who want to watch more serious actors try their hand at slapstick. I found it hard to decide if I liked it or not. That's why I only gave it 3 stars.",1376611200,,219,3.782608695652174

4169569,4,B003Q6D2B4,"RED is a silly but very fun movie. The cast and premise of this film are great. Malkovich, Willis, Mirren , Freeman and Mary Louise Parker ? Looks like they all had a great time during this project. Brain Cox makes an appearance as the Soviet bad guy with a heart of gold.

Well worth watching",1376524800,,293,4.232142857142857

4169572,5,B003Q6D2B4,Good story line and character development. The absurdity of the retiree coming back as the bad-ass hero is compelling to say the least...very funny!,1376524800,,148,5.208333333333333
4169573,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie isn't super deep.  But it is a relatively clean, fun action-adventure.

John Malkovich is hilarious in parts and Bruce Willis plays his normal role.

Sprinkle a little Morgan Freeman on top and you have a tasty, entertaining Saturday night.",1376524800,,251,5.073170731707317

4169577,5,B003Q6D2B4,"See...Hollywood can produce a film without a sex scene and it still can be a great movie! Loved the scene when Bruce Willis asks her...""Did he just call you Bunny?""",1376524800,,164,4.5
4169578,4,B003Q6D2B4,This is an entertaining movie that combines action adventure with comedy.  It was most fun to watch an actress like Helen Mirren take on a role that is entirely unlike other roles she has had.  Looking for something to watch? Do not hesitate to rent this.,1376524800,,255,4.521739130434782
4169579,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Don't expect an Oscar for Best Actress, but this was a great movie to watch. If you like these sort of comedy/shootem up movies this is a must.",1376524800,,143,4.142857142857143
4169580,5,B003Q6D2B4,"The movie is great. We saw Red 2 and decided we should watch the first one second(don't recommend that order), but we enjoyed both. My problem was with the download. First off we decided to watch it one evening and find out the download is going to take 6 hours to download to our Tivo. After that downer we went on with the download and chose to watch it the following evening. An hour and a half into the movie, it stalls out and we can't finish the thing! Very disturbing! I call Amazon and they tell me to reset router and Tivo and try a new download. He refunds the cost of the 1st download and I still have to pay for the 2nd. He says it should take around an hour for the download. After waiting an hour we gave up and went to bed, so finally the following evening we get to finish the movie three days in. I gave the movie 5 stars because it is a good movie, love the cast, but amazon needs to work on the downloading process. I think I'll stick to Netflix.",1376438400,,965,4.057591623036649
4169581,5,B003Q6D2B4,"We saw this movie in preparation to see ""RED 2"" at the theater. What a pleasant surprise! Action and comedy intelligently mixed! An entertaining tale that shows retired  professional assassins not only coping with life-and-death situations but also personal relationships and their struggle to become ""ordinary"" after a lifetime of routinely and casually dispatching bad guys. Bruce Willis plays an average Joe who just happens to have his hit-man past catch up to him suddenly and violently. Mary-Louise Parker plays his uninitiated love interest who is initially terrified but eventually turned-on by all the intrigue. In order to survive, Willis needs to enlist the aide of old cronies Morgan Freeman, John Malkovitch, and Helen Mirren all of whom give solid performances. One of the funnier action/comedies of recent years (and the sequel was even BETTER).",1376438400,,860,5.37037037037037

4169585,5,B003Q6D2B4,"The movie is perfectly cast!  What a pleasure to watch Helen Miren be a hired gun!  We watched it twice!  Well cast, well written and somewhat different from the usual Bruce movie in that the comedy goes very well with the killing!",1376438400,,231,4.4523809523809526

4169605,5,B003Q6D2B4,the plot was thin and outrageous but what else do you expect from a bang bang shoot em up with Bruce Willis It was exactly what I like to see in this type of movie a few car chases lots of explosions.

I actually felt I was experience the unfolding of events as they happened to the character and was not able to necessarily figure out the full plot by the middle of the movie as most action movies these days.

4169611,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This is a typical Bruce Willis movie. It moves quickly with a lot of sarcasm and humor. Killings abound. It cannot be taken seriously. It is a great parody on other, more serious, action movies.",1376265600,,194,4.571428571428571

Nothing serious here, just crazy silly fun that left big smiles and a yearn for more.  Which is good since the sequel is already out.  Saturday night popcorn movie with no redeeming message, just good entertainment with lots of bang bang and silly antics wrapped nicely in some great, and some not so great actors.",1376265600,,459,4.493975903614458

Talk about action and excitement! I love the ""mature"" actors!  When Richard Dryfess appeared I just about died laughing!  What a suprise!  All I can say is, there's life in us old dogs afterall!  All these ""retired"" agents (Retired and Extremely Dangerous-RED) showing that they still got the stuff.  I don't want to give away the story, so I'll just say that if you like a good, action-filled movie without a lot of ""F"" words and gore, you'll probably love this movie.  The action doesn't stop from the time Ben's Christmas decorations get taken out until the final ""chase"" scene with John Malkovich (wearing a dress) riding in a handcart pushed by Bruce Willis!

4169634,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Story was excellent.

Problem was in downloading it. Every 5 minutes it had to reload additional material. Do not have the download problem with Netflix and usually do not with Amazon--just with this particular rental.",1376092800,,218,5.228571428571429
4169635,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I told my husband several years ago that I had seen this at a cousin's house and it was action with some good fun.  He grunted. Then someone told him about the new one and he was interested in that so I rented this in case the new one is a sequel. Since it was my 2nd time, I gave it a 4.  My husband got a charge out of it for action scenes and gags but for this review he said 4 also. His reasoning:  It did not keep you completely on the edge of your seat the whole time and it was not quite as funny as some Bruce Willis flicks he has seen.  Still, it was entertaining without a lot of swearing and WOW! No unwanted sex scenes!  We just do not care for that sort of thing so in that department I would have to give it a 5 for writing a plot not dependent on vulgar language and crass scenes.",1376092800,,795,3.793939393939394

4169638,4,B003Q6D2B4,Parody disguised as adventure and travelogue. Violent but cartoony very quickly. Especially enjoyed Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren in their roles as 'reluctantly' unretired agents.,1376092800,,179,6.2

4169641,3,B003Q6D2B4,"The initial premise is an interesting idea, the acting is quite good and there are no dull moments.
However, there are huge gaping holes in the storyline.  Just to give one away:  Bruce Willis, a retired CIA agent lives in a residential neighborhood and is on friendly terms with his closeby neighbors.  When his name comes up on a secret list for elimination, the bad guys attack in the middle of the night with a full range of assault weapons, destroy his home and yet, not one peep or even a light from any other homes on the block!
If you're just wanting 2 hours of adventure, without having to think about it ever again, this may be just the thing for you.",1376092800,,661,4.357723577235772

4169655,2,B003Q6D2B4,"Very slow moving and the characters were not interesting.  After deciding that Red 2 was not worth the price of admission  and popcorn at a theater, we thought the original might' be better but if that is true, Red 2 must be really bad.",1376006400,,236,4.340909090909091

If you like high action scenes with a decent story line, this is for you.  Bruce Willis and John Malkovich are a great pair and really make a great team.

The plot is one we've seen before however the combination of
wit and slapstick humor (especially around John Malkovich) is wonderful!

4169684,3,B003Q6D2B4,"Found it entertaining, but nothing more.  I am fan of all of the actors but the script lacked something.  I like the usual comic relief to break the high tension, but the tension was never that real for me.",1376006400,,206,4.256410256410256

It came in blocky, stuttering, skipping and several times there were pauses in the streaming.  I have not had these issues with movies rented from iTunes, Netflix or Hulu in the past three years.

4169696,5,B003Q6D2B4,What a fun movie to watch. I recently found this at my local Library & knew I had to get this in Blu-ray. It has such a good cast too. I am glad they put this out in the 2:40:1 Aspect Ratio. I just enjoy the movies better when you can see the entire screen as the Director intended. Can't really comment on the Audio as I am currently using only my tv speakers. It probably is fine though. The Special Features are: Audio commentary: Deleted & Extended Scenes: {No big deal here} & something called Access Red which sends me back to Audio Commentary. Special Features aren't all that important to me as much as the quality of the movie being watched. The Blu-ray is quite good compared to the picture on my dvd. This movie puts a smile on my face every time I watch it. Glad I got it in Blu-ray.,1375747200,,795,4.1688311688311686

4169700,5,B003Q6D2B4,"It would have been hard for Red to miss on the rating chart for me because there wasn't a major cast member that I don't absolutely enjoy their work and have enjoyed their work.  Every single name I saw during the opening credits was a draw to this movie for me.  Still, the writing was fun, it seemed to flow in an organic manner that allowed easy suspension of disbelief even though there were some truly ridiculous moments that verged on slapstick.",1375747200,,451,4.487804878048781

4169707,1,B003Q6D2B4,The playback quality wasn't up to the usual Amazon quality. The picture was grainy and stopped multiple times during playback. I did a Speedtest.net check on my system afterward as I had never had a problem and my download speed checked fine so it must have been an Amazon problem.

4169843,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Okay, in my opinion, Malkovich absolutely steals this movie.  He's so crazy and so in character throughout...both hilarious and a little melancholy.  Just awesome.  Lots of action, lots of humor, some cool effects (check out the Mythbusters where they try to recreate the scene in the tractor trailer yard) and a whole bunch of spies.  What's not to love!  From start to finish, I think the story was very well-crafted and just a whole lotta fun.",1375142400,,446,4.815789473684211

You rarely come across a movie with these elements and they actually pull it off, in this case it's perfection.  If you have not had the chance to see this movie, there is no better time, with the great price from Amazon and the second movie right around the corner, this is a must see movie.",1375142400,,463,4.238636363636363
4169845,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Who knew a flick about a group of old f*rts going rogue and kicking some serious arse could be so much darn fun?  I stumbled across RED recently while channel surfing, and before I knew it, I was watching intently, a fixed grin on my mug.  When a group of former CIA ops reunites to take on a federal government bent on taking them out for knowing too much, with the Vice President himself (Julian McMahon) and an international weapons dealer (Richard Dreyfuss) pulling the strings, you've got a recipe for shoot-'em-up fun.  And the group of senior former spies?  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren (with a dazzling Mary-Louise Parker thrown in as love interest for Willis's character).  To watch this ensemble go to work--especially Mirren packing a machine gun--you can't help but love it, and have grand fun watching.

Yet RED is more than violence and action-packed thrills; this movie has a razor sharp, never-ending comedic edge.  To watch Malkovich muck it up with an array of unreal weapons is sheer bliss; and the character actor Brian Cox adds his own brand of humor to the mix playing a former KGB adversary who is madly in love with the Mirren character.  The cast just meshes, and you can tell they had as much fun making RED as the viewer has watching RED.  It comes as no surprise this film spawned a sequel currently making the theatrical rounds; if one can have this much fun watching a group of seniors take no prisoners, then the sky's the limit when it comes to keeping the action coming as the RED franchise rolls merrily along.

Red is a perfect example, the mastery of the art of acting in this film is sublime! What fun to witness the great performances by each and every member of this STAR cast. However they had a little help, with equally masterful direction, writing, cinematography,special effects and I think all the way to the catering. Every aspect of this film looks like it was as much fun for them as it is for us. I rent movies first to see if they are films I will want to watch often, well Red is on my buy list now!

Sadly, had I just scrolled down in my DVR list, I already had it recorded off of ShowTime or HBO or one of them, and I could have saved the $2.99. Not Amazon's fault though. I am still amazed at how well the streaming works, even with HD content (given my crappy DSL broadband connection and the fact that I'm streaming via WiFi, not wired!) although I don't think, and I may be wrong, the surround sound is sent with the video - my system seemed to only be simulating 2 channels of sound out to the other speakers.",1374710400,,570,4.1909090909090905

You'll love Warm Bodies, Burn After Reading which star John Malkovich. There's a William Moses character taking out various people on a list. The soundtrack features classic rock.

I can recommend this movie to people who like watching Bruce Willis be Bruce Willis and John Malkovich hamming it up with a marginally believable character. I was a little uncomfortable with the barely developed love story between Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, but I guess she was included for youth appeal.

4170032,2,B003Q6D2B4,"Red (a.k.a. Retired Extremely Dangerous) is like the Expendables with even older people, adding more comedy, and not being as fun.  Like the Expendables Red brings in many famous actors like Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, etc. and they embark on a crazy adventure together.  In the film these individuals are retired CIA agents.  However, because of the CIA hunting them down they are forced out of retirement and kick ass once again.  It is an awesome concept (especially with such big names), but one that does not live up to what it could have been.

First off the entire story is very basic and not deep or engaging at all.  A simple story can work if I am entertained, and in this case I wasn't really.  The action scenes are nothing to run home about.  They were alright, but I have seen much better in countless action films like Expendables and Expendables 2.  The villain played by Richard Dreyfuss is lame as well.  He is very basic and has no depth what-so ever.  Plus he gets defeated way too easily.  A big problem with the film is that the final action scene is extremely anticlimactic.  The heroes beat the villain without much of a hitch.

The characters are hit or miss for me.  Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox are a lot of fun in the film.  Bruce Willis does a good job performance wise, but I found his character to be bland compared to most of the rest of the main cast.  Carl Urban's character I did not really care for either.  He is presented as a rival for Bruce Willis but comes off as more of a nuisance.

Sarah Ross, who played on the show Weeds, I did not like at all.  She plays Bruce Willis's love interest and the token damsel in distress.  I found her useless and very annoying.  In terms of the comedy her jokes were the weakest and did nothing for me.  She was really only in the film to appeal to a demographic.  She should have been left out and focused on the main group kicking ass.

Overall, Red is a mediocre action film at best.  Some of the characters are a lot of fun.  However, other characters were annoying like Sarah Ross and Richard Dreyfuss's character.  Plus you have an uninteresting story, bland villains, and mediocre action scenes.  I know that this is based on a comic.  I do not know if this is how the comic was because I have not read it.  If you want a good action movie with big name actors watch the Expendables.",1374364800,,2441,4.417977528089888

4170060,5,B003Q6D2B4,The acting and lines were super.  All actors were casted well and did a great job of entertaining you with excitement and comedy...that can be tricky and they carry it off with aplomb.

4170071,2,B003Q6D2B4,My husband wanted to view this movie so we streamed it last night.  He seemed to really enjoy it but I gave up on it about halfway through and got out my book to read.

I was excited until I realized that I had never seen the whole movie in its entirety all at once.  Looking at my netflix and direct tv on demand, it was not available so I signed up for Amazon Prime just to rent this.  I LOVED THIS EXPERIENCE.  Paid $2.99 and got to watch it instantly - no buffering, no need to wait while it downloads in full.  Fast forward and rewind worked extremely well also.",1374105600,,511,4.173469387755102
4170078,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I was skeptical but that quickly disappeared after the movie started.  Great actions scenes and what a cast!  John Malkovich is priceless in this movie.

4170079,5,B003Q6D2B4,"A wonderful collection of senior cast members and great story made this movie worth adding to the library. Funny, a tad over the top, and campy dialouge mad this worth seeing again.",1374105600,,181,4.6875

4170085,5,B003Q6D2B4,The idea behind this movie makes me happy. CIA agents don't just disappear after they retire. I am sure they struggle to find their own way. this hillariouse cast makes this awkwardly funny movie work. the Retired and Extremely Dangerous crew are amazing.,1374105600,,255,4.953488372093023

4170090,5,B003Q6D2B4,"A great movie! Lots of action and great humor. These actors click so well that it makes it a true pleasure to view!

4170091,5,B003Q6D2B4,So funny and exciting.  All the characters brought their own individual humor to the project. Laughed throughout the whole movie.  Totally enjoyable.  Can't wait to see Red 2.,1374019200,,175,5.178571428571429

4170097,4,B003Q6D2B4,Veteran acting talent and entertaining mystery plot made this a very good movie.  Some very funny lines thrown in with some good old fashioned violence.  I liked the fact that they just used wit and weapons.  It's not really believable when an old guy goes all kung fu on somebody.,1374019200,,281,4.58
4170098,4,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie provided many laughs along with entertaining action.  Not suitable for children, this is definitely a good adult movie.  I would definitely recommend it to others to see.",1374019200,,181,5.206896551724138

4170100,1,B003Q6D2B4,"The movie is great. Lots of fun. Great crash scenes. Now I'm ready to see Red 2. I don't know who to blame for all the stops, Amazon or Comcast. It stopped five (5) times and reloaded.",1373932800,,184,4.0

4170102,5,B003Q6D2B4,"RED is a great combination of a CIA spy movie and a comedic flick.  Ex-CIA agents fighting for their lives in this movie as they come back together and awaken their friendships provides a great, funny, and decently action-packed movie to entertain a wide variety of tastes.  I personally greatly enjoy this movie and plan on seeing RED 2 when it comes out if only for the characters...but I hope the plot is good too.  I would highly recommend this movie to all audiences that it is rated for.  The violence is not overbearing by any means and the language is minimal.

Excellent movie.",1373932800,,586,4.596153846153846

4170111,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Once again for me, this movie was enjoyable mostly because of the ""cast of characters"" in it - Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, etc.
It was an ""action"" movie, which is not normally what I seek out, but this one has a touch of fun and humor and a James Bond type quality where not everything (not much) is believable! Also, for me it was a bit hard to follow the thread of what was going on and why...the action and fast pace of the film, and moving from city to city where you were thrown into a whole new scenario, was difficult for me. All in all, I liked it. Not sure if I will go to see ""Red 2"" which is coming out soon. Maybe 1 is enough.",1373932800,,640,3.9689922480620154
4170112,5,B003Q6D2B4,We enjoyed this movie.  Well done.  Nice combination of action with some laughs.  We are looking forward to the sequel.  Is that Red-2?,1373932800,,135,4.739130434782608

4170115,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Somehow this movie slipped under my radar. A friend told me about it this summer, and then I saw the commercials for Red 2, and thought I'd better check it out. It was delightful! The writing, acting, and host of stars were terrific! Rent it today, if you want to have fun while watching a movie.",1373932800,,296,4.303571428571429
4170116,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Good cast, good action, good humor.  They really don't make action comedies that are to entertaining so I'm glad I caught Red.  And I have to say I will give Red 2 a view at the theatre.",1373846400,,186,4.0

4170120,1,B003Q6D2B4,Whole concept ridiculous !  I couldn't even watch past first 15 min! It should be listed as a comedy or tongue in cheek!,1373846400,,120,4.217391304347826
4170121,5,B003Q6D2B4,This is a great movie. Love all the actors in it and John Malkovich played one of his best parts in this. One I can watch again and again and still get a great laugh each time.,1373846400,,176,3.7837837837837838

We laughed throughout the whole movie!  It was over the top shooting and explosions but the movie never took itself too seriously.  All of the lead actors had their tongues placed firmly in their cheeks as they played their over the top characters!  It's a fun movie... I would definitely recommend it!",1373846400,,499,4.333333333333333

4170127,3,B003Q6D2B4,"I thought the story of this movie was very good and believable in the beginning. As time goes on and the story unfolds it becomes very unbelievable and fairly wild. But if you like the shoot em up, blow em up movies, you will like this one.",1373760000,,240,4.127659574468085
4170128,3,B003Q6D2B4,Only the movie's lack of plausibility holds me back from giving it 4 stars. If this was a comedy it would be slapstick. Very entertaining nonetheless and worth watching.,1373760000,,169,4.862068965517241

4170137,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This is the type of summer blockbuster I can watch again & again & never get tired of watching.

Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, & Dame Helen Mirren give  tour de force performance as retired CIA and MI-6 agents reuniting to uncover why one of their own is in the CIA's crosshairs.

There's action & adventure with side order of romance and dating.",1373673600,,362,4.625
4170138,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Nice little escapist movie.  It was funny and things blow up!  Bruce Willis and John Malkovich were both great.  Now, I'm looking forward to Red 2.",1373673600,,147,4.576923076923077

4170140,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Red was a whole lotta mindless fun for me.  I could have enjoyed it on the basis of John Malkovich's performance alone but the beautiful Mary Louise-Parker was certainly no slouch, either.  She shows off her hilarious comedic skills as well.  Of course, Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis to a tee as usual and that always works for me.  Thoroughly enjoyable, funny action film.",1373587200,,375,4.8125
4170141,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I was not expecting this movie to be so much fun. I'm looking forward to the second Red movie too. There is plenty of action, humor,and great acting. I love Helen Mirram as the hit woman! Bruce Willis is great as always and Morgan Freeman was very funny. Everyone gave a good performance and the story is fast paced and fun.",1373587200,,324,4.327868852459017
4170142,3,B003Q6D2B4,"Malkovich's part as a paranoid ex-cia acid guinea pig was pretty funny and Bruce Willis is good as usual as the stoic, terse, long suffering uber-competent killer.",1373587200,,163,5.074074074074074
4170146,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Enjoyed the movie.  Have watched it numerous times over the past several months.  Waiting for Red2.  Too bad Morgan Freeman won't be in 2, as he was great in the first movie.",1373587200,,174,4.375
4170147,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie was a wonderful roller coster ride from the very beginning, with brilliant performances from some of the ""older"" actors of our generation. Not only did they prove in the movie they could still kick butt, they proved they still were excellent actors on the screen. I miss those that have died since this movie was made.",1373587200,,329,4.689655172413793
4170148,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Fun, light hearted, easy watching film - its not complicated, doesnt keep you on the edge of your seat and wouldnt be one to watch again and again - but entertaining nonetheless.",1373587200,,178,4.59375
4170149,5,B003Q6D2B4,Red is a good mix of action and humor featuring a great cast. So easy to rent from Amazon. Can't wait to see Red 2.,1373500800,,115,3.64
4170150,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I had low expectations for this but was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek about this film and they pull it wonderfully.

I only give 5 stars to films I would enjoy watching again.",1373500800,,201,4.583333333333333
4170151,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Trying to find movies my husband and I both like is always a challenge as our taste is so different. When I saw the previews for Red 2, I went looking for Red since we had never seen it. It was listed at Amazon for a very reasonable price and we really enjoyed it.",1373500800,,264,3.9074074074074074
4170152,4,B003Q6D2B4,Great home viewing movie. The acting is solid with many great actors. Laughs throughout keep the movie light with enough action to keep it moving along.,1373500800,,152,4.884615384615385
4170153,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This is a quirky, fun, action adventure with an all star cast. Lots of action sequences as well as comedy. Some foul language but not a lot(one f bomb). I don't want to drop any spoilers so I'll just say that I saw this movie when it was in theaters and I liked it so much that I rented it to watch when my daughter was down visiting.",1373500800,,334,3.926470588235294

4170167,4,B003Q6D2B4,"This is not a great movie, but it is a great deal of fun to watch.  Actors are all likeable and the story moves along.",1373414400,,118,3.72
4170168,2,B003Q6D2B4,"With a cast like this, this movie should be wonderful! It's a pile of so many of my favorite actors. But it was simply boring. The plot made little sense, the relationships were barely developed, even the action sequences were less-than-active (except for a couple, and those were so fiercely violent and not in keeping with the movie they weren't fun.) We suffered through the whole thing, but knew after about the first half-hour we should really have moved on.",1373414400,,463,4.8
4170169,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie is a typical Bruce Willis action movie.  Lots of thrills, action and laughs.  Love this guy and all of his movies.  Very entertaining.",1373414400,,145,4.72
4170170,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I loved the cast and Mary-Louise Parker did a fantastic job. It's fairly cookie cutter. Girl leading boring life yearns for adventure, meets boy with a dangerous past, they fight for their lives together.... I like those movies. Good action, great comedy, a little love story, great movie.",1373414400,,289,5.041666666666667

4170172,5,B003Q6D2B4,Did not get a chance to see this when it was at the theater but wanted to see it before Red 2 came out.  Amazon Instant Video was a great way to catch up.  This is a classic spy spoof with just enough action to make it an action movie and just enough comedy to make it fun.,1373414400,,273,3.689655172413793
4170173,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie went by fast, there was a lot of action, humor and yes a love story thrown in there too..  I enjoyed it from beginning to end",1373414400,,136,3.857142857142857

4170197,4,B003Q6D2B4,Did not expect too much. But this is really a fun movie.  Great acting all around. John Malkovich steals the show. (my personal favorite is Brian Cox)  Now I have to watch the sequel!  Recommended.,1373328000,,197,4.571428571428571
4170198,3,B003Q6D2B4,"Couldn't find any way to re-download or get help without calling, so flushed the $2.99 and went on with our evening",1373328000,,115,4.523809523809524
4170199,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Good Movie, the acting and wonderful old actors seemed to really be enjoying themselves.  The dialogue was never dry, fun to listen too. I gave it 4 stars because at the end it drug for about 10 minutes, like they were not sure how to end the movie.  But beside that it is worth watching.",1373328000,,288,4.218181818181818
4170200,3,B003Q6D2B4,I expected better acting from these professionals. They seemed to be simply reciting their lines with minimal effort to really act the parts.,1373328000,,141,5.173913043478261
4170201,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Loved the cast!  A little violent, but was softened a bit with the comedic relief.  Started a little slow, but once Helen Mirren joins the gang, they are rockin' and Rollin' and it's all action until the finish line!",1373328000,,216,4.512820512820513
4170202,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Helen Mirren holding a gun! Need I say more? Great cast, entertaining,charming. I can't wait for the sequel this summer.",1373328000,,120,5.05
4170203,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I seldom read movie reviews.  I never see eye to eye with the critics.  The cast is superb that is why I got the movie.  It did NOT disappoint.  I laughed so hard.  The interaction was fantastic.  The only problem is when Morgan Freedman died.
Get it - it is great",1373328000,,264,4.078431372549019

4170205,4,B003Q6D2B4,Good acting by entire cast makes for interesting plot and humor for retired spy and his former colleagues and adversaries.,1373328000,,122,5.15
4170226,5,B003Q6D2B4,great cast! john Malcovich was the highlight of the movie.  Government uses our heroes and throws them away.  Bruce is the standout .,1373328000,,133,4.739130434782608
4170227,4,B003Q6D2B4,Kept  my interest. Lots of action reguires suspension of disbelief.  Not for children. Would not recommend to friends but for 2.99 I am satisfied.,1373328000,,146,5.041666666666667
4170228,3,B003Q6D2B4,"I had seen the movie several years, but my granddaughter wants to watch the new Red 2 movie, but had never seen the first one, so we downloaded for her.",1373328000,,152,4.1
4170229,5,B003Q6D2B4,This movie was fun and engaging! Not for those that go to the movies to see real life - more for those who like over the top action for entertainment.,1373328000,,150,4.033333333333333
4170230,5,B003Q6D2B4,"All star cast makes this a great movie to watch, really funny with lots of action. One of Bruce's best by far.",1373328000,,110,4.045454545454546
4170231,5,B003Q6D2B4,My family loved this movie and we laughed.  We loved the premise of retired CIA agents that can still kick ass.  Bruce Willis and John Malkovich were amazing.  John was hilarious.  Helen Mirren was a delight and I was taken aback at how strikingly beautiful she can be.  Great movie.  I can't wait the see the sequel.,1373328000,,317,4.473684210526316
4170232,3,B003Q6D2B4,"If you want non-stop shoot 'em action from many of the actors known for this type of action, you'll enjoy this one",1373328000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4170233,5,B003Q6D2B4,We wanted to watch RED before we see the new RED movie coming out soon. Sooo glad we did. We enjoyed it and are now looking forward even more to seeing the new one. Lots of action and some laughs too. No nudity and little if any profanity which is rare these day.,1373241600,,263,3.981132075471698
4170234,5,B003Q6D2B4,The coolest actors having fun doing what they love. The beginning the the movie dragged a bit in the true Bruce Willis film set up way but once it got started....  I really enjoyed this film.,1373241600,,191,4.305555555555555

4170237,3,B003Q6D2B4,"It was an interesting story line and the cast was well selected.  Hard to see them characterized as old but I suppose they are AARP eligible.  Overall, it was interesting from beginning to end hoping for a more.",1373241600,,211,4.526315789473684

4170239,3,B003Q6D2B4,"This is not a great movie, but it's not completely bad either.  The movie is kind of slow at first then it picks up momentum.  I enjoyed watching this and think anyone will like it as well.",1373241600,,189,4.081081081081081

4170241,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Another great movie from Bruce Willis.  Can't wait for Red 2 to come to theatres.  Don't go to the movies often because they are full of progressive liberal agendas that I won't support with my money, but Bruce Willis is conservative and I will support him.",1373241600,,257,4.565217391304348
4170242,4,B003Q6D2B4,"...as long as you don't mind the violence.  The best thing about the movie is the confidence of characters as they carry out their deeds - and, the fact that society thinks the characters are done after years of service, and they definitely are not.",1373241600,,249,4.533333333333333
4170243,5,B003Q6D2B4,Wow - an all star cast and some memorable funny moments.  great to see toronto camouflaged as chicago but the story is unique and an absolute hit!,1373241600,,146,4.407407407407407

4170267,5,B003Q6D2B4,This movie was so well done. You really came to like all of the good guys and wanted the bad guys to get what they deserved. I wasn't to graphic in any way and not to sappy either. The acting was so believable and it was thoroughly enjoyable!,1373155200,,242,4.0625
4170268,3,B003Q6D2B4,It sort of drags at the end but some liked it. Watch it just for fun and what a cast.,1373155200,,85,3.3

We can't wait!",1373155200,,106,4.0476190476190474
4170273,5,B003Q6D2B4,Helen Mirren was the cherry on top of a fantastic cast of actors. All the action and humor I've come to expect from a Bruce Willis flick. Definitely a nice watch!,1373068800,,162,4.258064516129032
4170274,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I laughed out loud several times and smiled through pretty much the whole thing. How can you not, when Malkovich teams up with Willis and Mary Louise Parker is doing her ditzy thing? Helen Mirren and massive ammunition, perfect together. I had to ask myself at one point, what is the plot? But who cares. It's totally smart assed with lots of explosions and gags. I'm sure Red 2 will be the same.",1373068800,,396,4.438356164383562
4170275,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I loved this movie.  It was just a fun way to spend an afternoon.  The cast is amazing, and they all had such fun with it.  Helen Mirren is so spectacular.  I laughed out loud several times.  Well worth renting - I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.  Worth the price just to see Bruce Willis reading a romance novel!",1373068800,,319,4.233333333333333
4170276,5,B003Q6D2B4,We decided to watch this because the second movie is coming out soon.  I'm a Bruce Willis fan and everyone played their parts well.  It was fun to watch and had good characterization and dialogue.,1373068800,,196,4.571428571428571
4170277,4,B003Q6D2B4,Liked this one. Another Knight and Day and Mission Impossible (with humor) type movie. Funny how the two American government officials are foreigners with thinly veiled accents. Oh well. And to see Mary Louise Parker play a damsel in distress is worth it. And to see John Malkovich play a conservative government questioning gun toting guy is worth it too. Actually if you fear your government don't watch this one. :-) Anyway the best scene is when Mirren's character is in a ball gown one minute and behind a machine gun pummeling a limo the next. Loved it. I think the love story aspect of this mixed with the guns and action make it a good movie for a guy and girl to see together. Perhaps.,1373068800,,694,4.515873015873016
4170278,5,B003Q6D2B4,"It's great to see a cast that pushes each other to stretch in their performances.
It's even better when the overall production deserves no less.",1372982400,,144,4.8
4170279,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Excellent! Good plot, new sneaky information from the consultants, wonderful acting and actors who know how to act--not the celebrity types. There are a couple of ""oh, yeah, I've seen that before moments"", but generally it worked well on all levels.",1372982400,,249,5.097560975609756

4170284,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Great movie with dark comedy. Parker and Willis play off each other very well. Well written. A fun movie if your just an average guy that doesn't want his movies to ""make a statement"" or be so PC they forget to be good. Cant wait for Red 2",1372982400,,239,4.0

4170289,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Lots of things blowing up with Karl Urban, Morgan Freedman, John Malkovich, and Bruce Willis. What's not to like? John Malkovich was a hoot!  Loved Helen Mirren's character and was pleasantly surprised to see Ernest Borgnine pop in.",1372809600,,232,5.105263157894737

4170298,5,B003Q6D2B4,Enjoyable. The cast made the movie. The generation gap in a spy story. We can't wait for the sequel with yet another great cast.,1372636800,,128,4.375

It was pretty good, we enjoyed all the cheesy jokes, and there were a couple of twists we didn't see coming. There are some predictable parts (quite a few) but that's to be expected in the genre. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I was entertained. The predictability and cheesiness is why I gave it 4/5.

Worth my time. I enjoyed it!",1372636800,,447,4.321428571428571

4170314,5,B003Q6D2B4,"In Red you get to see the pros making a good movie and obviously having fun doing it. Malkovich, Dreyfuss, Cox, Freeman, Mirren and good old Willis himself--what more could you ask for. I enjoyed this movie immensely. But the greatest part of the movie was the actors and the great chemistry between them combining to make pure entertainment. Silly, hilarious and just plain good fun.",1372550400,,384,4.833333333333333
4170315,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I'd call this a good action movie. Little bits of humor added in, like most action movies. They added a tiny twist with the agent pursuing the lead character (Bruce Willis) , in that they try to make him likeable. Seeing who the exact villain is not so straight forward, though not some huge surprise either. All in all, good action flick.",1372464000,,339,4.483870967741935

4170325,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Critics were mostly tepid on Red, which kept me from seeing it in the theater.  I should know not to listen to critics, by now.  I loved this flick!  It's nothing extraordinary, but I found the balance of story, humor and action to be perfect.  Great cast, fun time.  Can't remember where I read it, but someone had stated this is what s/he expected The Expendables to be, and that's a pretty good statement.  Red really is a fun ride.",1372291200,,435,4.375

He incorporates the help of some previous friends to help him out and in the end is vindicated.  If you just want some action without having to think much in the movie then this is for you.,1372118400,,365,4.112676056338028

4170345,2,B003Q6D2B4,"I know with all action movies you're required to suspend belief in the plausibility and not take them so serious.  But there are times when you just can't  stop from rolling your eyes. Individually these are some of my favorite actors (thus giving this movie an extra star).  Together.... Eh.  Bruce although playing the ""cool, calm, quiet assassin"" type seems to be just going thru the motions - been there, done that . Helen has her moments but whenever she fires some gun you giggle knowing she'd really be knocked on her ass. Malkovich plays his usual crazy.  The ""Weeds"" actress was the hardest sell.  Yes she's bored and sick of the life she's living, just wanting a little adventure, but she's too excepting of all the chaos that has come to her door.  Clearly some people liked this movie because there's a sequel coming, I just shrug ""why?"".",1371945600,,850,4.6644295302013425

4170349,1,B003Q6D2B4,This is a very stupid movie.  Very predictable. Good actors but not worth it.  I couldn't wait to finish it.  It was that bad.,1371686400,,126,4.166666666666667
4170350,5,B003Q6D2B4,This is an very enjoyable movie which has a number of twists and turns but keeps the action and adventure at a high pitch.  Really enjoyed the dead pan performance by Helen Mirren and the classic characterization by John Malkovich.

The only draw back for me was gratuitous language near the end of the movie.  I felt that it real wrecked what had been a fun ride up to that point and did not add anything material to the overall plot. I think that without the unnecessary language I might have given it a five star rating.  With the current ending it caused me to waver between three and four stars - it was that disconnected from the rest of the experience.,1369440000,,597,4.303571428571429

The crisp Blu-ray transfer beats the DVD transfer, even when the latter has been up-scaled to 1080p. Multi-channel audio was expectedly rich with good dynamic range.

As for the keepcase, upon unboxing the Amazon cardboard shipping box, I discovered that it was cracked at several locations. Fortunately, the enclosed Blu-ray/DVD flipper disc seemed unharmed. More care should be taken to prevent such damages from occurring.",1367020800,,673,5.339622641509434

4170486,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Last night's DVD was ""RED"" starring Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman. I found it in the  five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, this one has to be one of the weirdest movies I've seen in decades. It's actually hard to explain. You have to see it to believe it. The movie is very funny, but it's largely done in a straight-faced style as an action movie and concerns a group of about a half-dozen retired CIA agents. In fact, the RED stands for ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous."" Okay, so these retired agents are having problems turning off their agentry. They're having trouble adjusting to normal life, to say the least. They still enjoy breaking heads, killing people in creative ways and riddling the landscape with machine-gun fire. Have you ever seen a house completely destroyed by machine-gun fire? Well, here's your chance. It's absurd, of course, but no more absurd than lots of stuff you see in action movies.

Some of the scenes are such that I haven't laughed so hard in years. Take one scene, for example. A woman agent fires a grenade rifle at a guy who has a gun. He sees the projectile coming and fires his own conventional gun to stop it. Well, the ultra-slow-motion photography picks up the grenade projectile and the bullet heading toward one another at supersonic speed, making a precise nose-to-nose impact and causing a humongous explosion. This one will leave you wondering how did they ever do it, but you'll be crying with laughter while you're thinking about it. All sorts of other stunts fill the movie. It's a frolicking good time. Trust me.

Do you have any questions about CIA activities? Well, this movie will flush them out into the open. I'm sure we all have strange ideas about ultra secret organizations such as the CIA and this movie preys on our anxieties. It's funny, but I'd sure like to know what a real CIA Agent thought of the movie. In this regard, there's an interesting extra feature attached to the movie and I'd suggest you watch it. It's an outstanding movie. The whole cast does an excellent acting job. It's well filmed. The stunts are magnificent. The story is far fetched, but, hey, this is a fine comedy so relax and enjoy.

4170495,5,B003Q6D2B4,"The slow start (within the first two minutes) is misleading to a point.  This movie bursts into action and never stops.  It is hilarious, but mind-boggling with one thinks about how government could be operating (and probably is).  I loved the characters, the flash moves from scene to scene, the relationship between the characters and most of all, I loved the portrayal of ""older folks"" getting the best of the younger generation.

This has a great plot, based on a graphic novel, about a group of retired assassins who come out of the shadows to create mayhem one last time. But unlike other attempts at a similar story (*koff*EXPENDABLES*koff*) there's more there. There are characters being developed and plots and turns and twists, and Helen Mirren with a machine gun. And Karl Urban, who can make a bloody nose look good. Better than it should, in fact. And he fights in a suit. How can you not love that?

And I don't ever remember liking Bruce Willis as much as when I saw this. There's supposed to be a sequel out soon- you can bet I'll be in line for that one. And ordering up the DVD after.",1366156800,,745,4.23943661971831

The John Malkovich character is a hoot--lost a lot of brain cells decades ago when the CIA was using him as a guinea pig for drug testing.  Enjoy the film, but don't look too hard for logic.

Willis carries it so well and understated--his character is believable as well as those characters he plays to find out who put a hit out on him.  Each actor that is introduced adds another flavor.  The special effects are great--especially where Willis' character is stepping out of the car in New Orleans--how do they do that!!!??  Parker's portrayal of the bored government worker and the slightly over-her-head situations her character finds herself in makes the movie all the more believable and fun.  Helen Miran is great especially as she shares that her character takes on the odd outside assignment when she misses the old days.  Morgan Freeman's scene in the nursing home with the TV is funny and Malkovich is the perfect actor to play his character.  This is also Ernest Borgnine's last movie before he passed away--he had ""It"" until the end.",1364774400,,897,4.900662251655629

4170543,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I know movies can be considered an art form, a way to make a social/political statement, and/or a means of experimenting with style and content.  But let's face it -- many of us go to the movies not to be educated or culturally refined, but to be entertained.  I know I've enjoyed my share of brainless but fun blockbusters, such as the ""Transformers"" film series and the ""A-Team"" movie, and will gladly choose a Pixar or Disney movie over a more ""arty"" foreign film.  There are wonderful, art-worthy Oscar contenders that I will probably never watch again, simply because though I acknowledge they are good, they just weren't fun, while less artistically impressive movies will become a hit with me because of how much I enjoyed myself watching them.

""RED"" is not an Oscar contender, and has absolutely no pretense of making a statement or considering itself high art.  But it's a blast nonetheless.

(For the record -- no, I have not read the comic series this is based on, so I'm judging the film solely on its own merits.)

Frank Moses is a ""RED"" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) CIA agent, trying to grow accustomed to a quiet civilian life and having slightly flirty phone conversations with Sarah, the customer service agent at his pension office.  His attempts to relax and enjoy retirement are shattered when a hit squad attacks his house one night, sending him on the run.  With a rather reluctant Sarah in tow, he makes a cross-country trip to round up his old CIA buddies -- Joe, terminally ill but still kicking; Marvin, paranoid and deliciously crazy; Victoria, an elegant and soft-spoken ""wetwork"" agent; and ex-Russian secret agent Ivan.  As they put together the pieces and discover their team is being hunted down due to their connection with a military disaster in Guatemala, Frank is being pursued by young CIA agent and family man William Cooper, who follows orders with chilling precision but is seemingly unaware that he's being used as a tool by higher forces...

By far the best part of this film is the cast, containing such heavy hitters as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, and Richard Dreyfuss.  All of them look like they're having an absolute blast making this movie, and sling hot lead and sharp one-liners with equal zest.  John Malkovich chews quite a bit of scenery as Marvin, easily making him one of the funniest characters in the film, and Helen Mirren shines as Victoria, obviously having fun being a proper lady with a machine gun.  Richard Dreyfuss has only a few scenes as a smirky weapons dealer, but he hams it up enough that he's quite memorable.  Morgan Freeman plays against type as Joe and has relatively few scenes for being one of the top-credited names, and Bruce Willis seems to be running mostly on autopilot as Frank Moses, but they're still both fun to watch and have some good lines.  Mary-Louis Parker is sweet and spunky as Sarah, and Karl Urban (probably best known for ""Star Trek"") is mostly playing straight man to the rest of the crew as Cooper, but does his job well enough that I can see him carrying a ""Bourne"" style action series on his own.

The film operates solely on ""Rule of Cool,"" eschewing realism for over-the-top explosions and loads of gunfire and fist-swinging action.  I don't particularly mind this, as I was enjoying the ride too much to nitpick at any errors.  This film knows what it is, and never has any pretense at art or high-minded storytelling.  The downside is that the plot tends to fall by the wayside in favor of fight and shoot-out scenes, but there's a good deal of humor, character development, and even a sweet romance to make up for any deficiencies in the plot.

Very fun and entertaining action flick, with good actors and memorable jokes and scenes carrying the movie quite well despite the fairly weak plot.  If you want a fun action flick, ""RED"" is a good choice, with something for just about everybody.  It's not going to win any awards, but it's sure going to entertain you.

P.S.  There's talk of a sequel... and reportedly when Helen Mirren was asked what it would take to get her into the sequel, she said ""just send me a script.""  I can only hope something good comes of this... :D",1363219200,,4215,4.708446866485014

4170545,4,B003Q6D2B4,"One nice thing about ""Red"" is that it doesn't take itself seriously. And with a Malkovich and a Mirren (among others), it doesn't have to. Totally implausible but immensely entertaining, the film needs to be taken for what it is: entertainment to go with the popcorn and drink. An added treat is a rare appearance by then-93 year old Ernest Borgnine, who seems to have been acting virtually up until his demise. And the SFX lovers will have a feast...",1362873600,,451,4.65

Yes, there were plenty of unbelievable moments. The plot was holier than the pope. But unless you need intellectual stimulation from a movie, relax. Enjoy the ride. Have some fun.

The cast speaks for itself and the players do quite a bit of playing, which is a good thing. The plot is fun to think about.

4170644,5,B003Q6D2B4,An amazing array of talent takes what could be a very formulaic movie and transforms it to a rollicking fun flick. Well worth the time to watch. The interplay between Willis and Malkovitch alone is worth it.,1356825600,,207,4.621621621621622
4170645,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Mary Louise Parker was not givin much recognition in the leading roles. She was equally as entertaining as Malkovich ,she was an accent to Willis and I can't imagine the success of this movie without her expressions. Hellen Mirren and Brian Cox were also very good roles. And as in every role that Morgan Freeman plays ,he is terrific
The cast as a whole were great . Another reviewer stated too much violence for children ,the news has more violence than this movie and it wasn't blood and guts .Most of the violent scenes were hilariously unbelievable such as shooting the shoulder launch missle ,and batting the grenade with the rifle butt .Great action.

I wore my first DVD out,had to order another",1356825600,,703,4.715447154471545

- Action: Lots and lots of action scenes that are very well done. Also, many explosions...

- Great Cast: Although some of the cast is slightly older than many of the current action stars, they do a superb job making this a movie which exceeds many of the recend action-genre releases. The characters were all well written and defined, with many developing well through the film.

- Humor and Fun: While not a comedy, the actors and writers managed to work many humorous and quirky scenes or lines into the movie.

- A Plot: Yes, this movie has a plot...not only that, it is very well written and developed.

This is one movie I added to my collection as I know I will watch it over, and over and over again.",1356739200,,823,4.423841059602649

The script is a little goofy, but the quality of the acting makes it work rather than turning it into a schlocky 80s action movie. I watched this several years ago in a hotel room, and have rented it once and since purchased it.",1354752000,,498,4.533333333333333

It even has romance - two of 'em. And something I value - it doesn't go over the top with special effects (there are plenty). That is, the FX don't make you feel like you're a helpless sentient being with sensitive skin who's being thrown into a wood chipper. Thoroughly enjoy this flick.",1354492800,,445,4.717948717948718

One of the reasons that it is so funny is because during action and serious scenes, out of nowhere they do something funny that is totally unexpected at that time. They say and do funny things in the most inappropriate moments to do or say such things. It is hilarious!! The action is also great.

I just wish the script gave them better things to do. The idea of retired CIA operatives forced back into action is fun, if not exactly fresh. But though it's great fun to see Helen Mirren brandishing an AK-47 with at least as much aplomb as Sly Stallone, the script is awful. The story is made up of spare parts from other comic-action capers, and doesn't make sense half the time. The editing is so bad that I had to double-check that the director wasn't Michael Bay. It's only because I love all these actors that I give ""Red"" three stars; without them, I would give it two at the most. (But without them, I would never have bothered to see this movie.)

4170695,5,B003Q6D2B4,"The comic that the movie is based on was written by Warren Ellis. Ellis is a writer that I tend to like and is the creator/writer of one of my favorite series: Planetary. However, I never read RED, so I really had no idea of what it was about other than what I saw in the trailer for the movie. It was a movie I really wanted to go see in the theater, but... well... last year was full of chaos which included, during the summer while RED was in theaters, our van, nearly literally, blowing up (while I was inside it, no less), so I never did make it into the theater to see it. That turns out to be (mostly) okay. There are a few scenes that would have been great to see on the big screen, especially the scene where Moses steps out of the police car (but, of course, at the theater we couldn't have immediately rewound that one and watched it, again, as my wife demanded we do), but, overall, it isn't the sort of movie that loses its impact in translation to the television screen since the movie is about the characters, not about the action.

The central character, Frank Moses, is played by Bruce Willis. This is just Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, but, when you need an actor to play the part of Bruce, there is no one else that can do that, and he is great in this role. It would not surprise me if Willis was in Ellis' head as he wrote the character, although that is pure speculation on my part. At any rate, Bruce is completely enjoyable in his role as Frank Moses, and I can't really imagine anyone else doing the role the justice that Bruce gave it.

Mary-Louise Parker plays the love interest, Sarah Ross. I've never been a big Mary-Louise Parker fan and never thought her memorable in any of the roles I've seen her in. In fact, I have to look to see what I actually have seen her in, so little impact she has had on me. I mean, I know she's the lead in Weeds, but I've never seen that and don't have any immediate plans to do so. However, she was perfectly delightful in  this role. She really brought just the right mixture of naivete, awe, and enthusiasm to the part. I'm not saying that there's not another actress that could have played that role, but she did a great job in it, and I can't think of anyone, off the top of my head, that could have done it better.

Then there's Morgan Freeman. Freeman is another that is hired just to play himself, and, again, there is no one else that can play Morgan Freeman better. This is not to say that Freeman is incapable of a greater range than just playing himself; we've seen him in more than enough features to see that Freeman can play, pretty much, anything that is asked of him, but, when you need the, mostly, compassionate (grand)fatherly figure, there's probably no one better than Freeman, so he excels in his role. I can't say more than that without giving away pieces of the plot that you don't want to know about if you haven't seen  the movie.

Freeman's counterpart is played by Helen Mirren, and she's no less than awesome. I believe that Helen Mirren can do pretty much anything, and I don't think she's ever hired to just ""be herself."" I don't even know what that would mean as I don't think I've ever seen her do anything that had just become cliche for her. Certainly, I've never seen her behind a machine gun before, so that was pretty incredible and probably worth the whole movie. However, her role is really summed up in her comment to Sarah, ""I kill people, Dear,"" just as if she was saying ""I made some cookies."" She was just perfect.

And that brings us to John Malkovich. Malkovich is like crab to me, and I don't mean that in a good way. I spent years and years eating crab because I felt like I ought to like it, but, every time I did, I came away from it with the thought, ""I just don't like it."" But I would try it, again, the next time because I felt likt I just ought to like it. Really, I did that for years before I finally decided, ""you know, I really just don't like crab"" and gave up on it for good. That is my experience with Malkovich. Any time he was in something, I would go into it with the thought that I ought to like it because it was John Malkovich, but I always came away just not liking the experience, most notably in Jonah Hex, which was just dreadful, I think, mostly, due to how horrible Malkovich was. There are a few notable exceptions, I suppose, such as Being John Malkovich, but he's not an actor I generally enjoy, mostly due to the fact that he's really just always the same in every role he's in. However, he was brilliant in RED! I'm not sure there is anyone else that could have pulled off this role and been believable in it. To some extent, he played the role the way he always is, but, it was like he turned his perfomance, this time, up to 11, and that's exactly what this called for.

The cast of villains, however, is somewhat divided. Richard Dreyfuss is amazing, as always, but Rebecca Pidgeon could have been replaced by anyone. Sure, the role wasn't written to stand out, but she did nothing to really make it her own, either. Karl Urban, on the other hand, was great. Hunky, pretty boy assassin. His complete seriousness in the role gave it the gravity and believability it needed, and he was pretty perfect opposite Bruce Willis. Besides, my wife says he's hot, although he needs to smile more. According to her. The last player for the villains is Julian McMahon. Although, I really enjoyed him as Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four; he is completely forgettable in his role as the vice president in RED and, probably, could have been replaced by just about anyone walking down the street.

I didn't get enough Ernest Borgnine. He's impossible not to love, and it's a great, albeit small, perfect role for him.

My immediate response to the movie was ""I'm going to have to buy this one."" And I will. My second response was, ""The kids will love this,"" and they did. I'm not really saying it's a family movie, but it certainly is a great movie for my family. My younger son asked me if they were going to make a prequel for it. heh Interestingly enough, they did do some prequel comics to coincide with the release of the movie. I haven't read those, either, though. Unfortunately, although the movie did make money, it wasn't the blockbuster they'd hoped it would be, so it's unlikely that there will be anything further. I guess I'm okay with that. I think it does help illustrate, however, that, as a culture, our current love is for super heroes, not comic books in general. I think Hollywood is kind of stuck on the idea that anything translated from comics will be a hit, but even a wonderful movie like RED underperformed due to its lack of capes and tights, as the cliche goes.

R.E.D. stands for ""Retired and Extremely Dangerous,"" and that's exactly what they are. The cast of RED is questionable for an action movie on paper (except for John McClane), but after seeing them all in action, it's better than I ever imagined. I had neutral expectations for this film, and I'm happy to say it's a pleasant surprise. Bruce Willis is as great as he's been in a while. That isn't saying much because he has not had much energy lately, but the rest of the cast picks up his slack tenfold. John Malkovich is amazing. He is genuinely hilarious. I thought it took some kind of special skill to make people laugh every time you spoke. He isn't a comedian, but whatever it is, he has it. The man is pure comedic genius in this movie. See it for him if nothing else. Malkovich isn't it though. There is also Helen Mirren in a fur coat and military boots, with a big @ss gun. Something worth mentioning is that they trained her well with those guns. The lady did not blink or close her eyes when shooting, like I'd expect her to. Just a straight face. I loved that. I really believed she was a trained killer. She is badass beyond words, yet manages to stay classy. How does she do it? The Queen with a freaking sniper rifle? Yes. And there is also Morgan Freeman. His last role was a President, now he's a retired agent. And he's great in his role, but don't expect to see him for too long.

The rest of the cast is good too. Ernest Borgnine made me smile in his tiny role, and I enjoyed Richard Dreyfuss. Yeah, the cast is full of older actors, but you won't be able to tell. I have to say that Mary Louise Parker was a little annoying at times, but she doesn't hinder the movie overall. The performances are great, but what else is there? The comedy aspect of the film is better than the action to be honest. I laughed a lot, and so did the rest of the audience. There are a couple of action scenes that will make you cheer though. Mainly the airport scene. I won't go into detail, but I think everyone will like that part, despite their feelings on the rest of the movie. Besides what I've mentioned, there isn't too much to else to the movie. I enjoyed the locale hopping. It was sort of Bond-like, but it stayed within the U.S. I also enjoyed the plot. It was slightly complex, but very easy to follow for the dimwits in the audience. No offense, to those of you who are dimwitted. :P I think this is a movie that will be very enjoyable to those of you who can ignore slight inconsistencies in the narrative and just enjoy the mayhem.

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

Fun fact before I begin.  Brian Cox, who is in this 'Red' I'm reviewing is also in another film entitled 'Red'.  The later 'Red' is about a man whose only friend in the world is killed by some punk kids.  His only friend is his dog.  Afterward things escalate for everyone, and Cox's character finds himself taking justice into his own hands.  I've never seen it, but it did well, (as far as renting goes).  People who rented it seemed to like it.  I plan on watching it sometime in the future.  Anyway...

This CIA infused 'Red' is quite a fun ride.  This was definitely a side project for all the actors involved, but they give it 100 percent, and it shows.  This movie delivers an all star cast involving:  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, the previously mentioned Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Karl Urban, Mary-Louise Parker and others.

This title came out a few years ago but is still an enjoyable film to watch.

***Movie/Plot Details, Some Spoilers Ahead***

The premise is simple, R.E.D. stands for ""Retired, Extremely, Dangerous.""  This cast of ex-killers are exactly that.  They may be up in years a little, but their skills are far from rusty.  The film first centers in on Bruce Willis's character, Frank Moses, a former CIA asset who is having a hard time adjusting to normal un-exciting civilian life.  He has no friends, no hobbies, and the only joy he has is ripping up his government paychecks so he has an excuse to call Mary-Louise Parker at the human resources department.  It's sad really.

Well, things heat up rather quick for Frank Moses, he is assaulted in his very own house by a killing squad one night.  After dispatching them all, this is Bruce Willis we're talking about, he goes on the road, kidnaps ...Parker and gets his old band of killing buddies back together to try and figure out why they are all getting marked for death after all these years.

There is an uneasyness between all the cast, every time they come face to face they always ask the same question, ""Are you here to kill me?""  They may be formal work mates but they are killers after all, and there can only be so much trust I guess.

Malkovich's character is by far the funniest in the movie.  He's your classic paranoid loner type.  The funny part is, his paranoias are actually true.

Morgan Freeman's screen time is not enough in my opinion, but the little he has is good.  Mirren and Brian Cox round out the team and we the viewers are left with a collection of actors that really work well together and deliver a good movie.

Oh...by the way Karl Urban is in the film.  He's the younger CIA wet work asset who is after Bruce Willis and the others.  Good fight scene between him and Willis.

---To Sum Up---

Great, funny, and action packed film.  I enjoyed it at the movie theater and on DVD numerous times.  It's really going for cheap now, so grab this one up.  Will there be a sequel?  I certainly hope so, this is too good to not jump into again.

Well that's my thoughts on this awesome movie.  Now if you'll excuse me there's someone at my door with a gun...oh it's just Bruce Willis.",1338508800,,3457,4.641322314049587

4170709,1,B003Q6D2B4,"First of all, take my review here with a grain of salt because Bruce Willis participating in a comedy/adventure is just a disaster/major disappointment waiting to happen.  And so... Red is just that- a waste of my precious time.  I knew this movie was going to be bad when it started- Bruce is calling a woman at work on the phone and for several minutes they talk nonsense about visiting Chili for vacation and other pointless topics.  That kind of writing is beyond pointless- it doesn't belong in ANY movie, let alone this one.  Well it gets worse, MUCH worse.

One night Bruce walks into the kitchen and *in the most melodramatic way imaginable* intruders with guns break in and attempt to take Bruce out.  I just assumed Bruce was imagining this entire incident given the lack of suspense... but no.  He responds by putting bullets in a frying pan and having them explode and shoot across the room in an attempt to trick the crazy gunmen.  I admit I DID like how the men were firing literally hundreds of bullets per second at Bruce's house.  I may dislike the guy in these type of films but I don't necessarily hate him *that* much!

The film then reveals what it is- a really pathetic, exaggerated, generic adventure/shooter.  Bruce kidnaps the woman he was chatting on the phone with, or rather, breaks into her home.  The suspense was killed here the moment the woman hesitated to feel frightened over Bruce's presence.  What?  The way the two of them communicate wasn't the least bit funny and perfectly indicated what kind of silliness and low budget writing this was going to be... for the next hour and 30 minutes.  It just gets worse from there.  Avoid.",1336089600,,1667,4.638225255972697

Throw in a Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich playing his usual loopy self and Helen St. Mirren as a guntoting sniper, well, have you got a movie or what?

There's even a gratuitous Mermaid Man (Ernest Borgnine of Spongebob voice work fame...I threw that in there for the kids) and Richard Dreyfuss as the baddie.

The whole thing works because of the acting period. Obviously, the actors had a ton of fun doing this and that is confirmed by the 30 minute extra on behind the scenes. Also, the director is a genius. His dissolves to each location by slapping up a postcard be it of New Orleans or New York City and how the camera zooms in to the location within the postcard is way cool.

The extras also rock as there's a great animated CIA conspiracy history, commentary tracks with an ex-CIA operative on there as well as this Red trivia track you can fool around with.

FYI, the movie title does not stand for some Communist plot (although Brian Cox plays an ex-KGB agent) but stands for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous.""",1327276800,,1397,4.6437246963562755

Last but not least, I was going to say how I love Karl Urban, Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, but just adore the other main actors, too, so cannot leave out Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and a wonderful cameo by Ernest Borgnine.",1327017600,,636,4.898148148148148

4170723,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Who would have thought ten years ago there would be an ensemble action film with Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich?  Throw in Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, and that is an absolute murderer's row of acting.  And it's just as good as expected.

The four main stars are RED, Retired Extremely Dangerous, ex-agents who are no longer predators but prey.  Or so the government and its lead agent (Karl Urban) think.  Willis leads the way like it's another installment of Die Hard, bringing along friends who he thought would make the movie-making experience enjoyable.  The professionalism, action, and comedy quickly creates familiarity and there isn't a dull point in the entire film.  To be quite honest, it's plays like the globe-trotting 20th sequel to Ocean's Eleven decades in the future.  Except in this version, Willis plays a better front-man than Clooney and Mirren is absolutely jaw-dropping in her ruthless portrayal as a wet-works expert.  The Freeman-Malkovich combo is collectively hilarious, with Freeman's easy playfulness and Malkovich's insane, paranoia providing a perfect complement to the rather straight-laced Willis spy games.

Great movie from beginning to end, literally every base is covered and enjoyable.  The action (car chases/crashes, guns and rockets, a few throat chops) is thrilling, the attempts at comedy are funny, and the drama is heartfelt and relatable.",1326585600,,1420,5.351351351351352
4170724,3,B003Q6D2B4,"I'll just start by saying that this was a fun movie to watch. Better than expected. I saw the previews and thought that it had potential, but I was weary because the reviews were so scattered in their opinions of it. I was still hopeful though, mainly because it had Bruce Willis (always good for a fun show), Morgan Freeman (awesome actor), Helen Mirren (excellent actress in cool roles), and Karl Urban (rising in stardom). Sorry, John Malkovich wasn't in that list because I was never really fond of him, but he did add a lot of comedy to this film. He did a great job in this role.
The story is about a group of retired CIA operatives who are suddenly thrown back into the action when they are strangely placed on the RED (retired, extremely dangerous) list and become targets for the police force.
Now, don't expect a lot of content when you watch the film. It is, above all else, an action film. It's kinda like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Eleven/dp/B000P0J0BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Eleven</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Free-or-Die-Hard/dp/B000VNMMR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Free or Die Hard</a>. It's got lots of guns, explosions, and ridiculous action. And lots of comedy. Lots and lots of comedy. But it is a man movie, so just enjoy the ride and don't think too hard.
I have to admit, I think my favorite part of the film was Mary-Louise Parker. She plays Willis' love interest in the film and she is hilarious. I think she really holds this movie together, aside from the action of course. Oh, and Helen Mirren blowing people away with a gun is pretty-dang funny too.
So, an enjoyable film with lots of comic surprises if you're in the mood for a good comedy-action flick.

As far as questionable content:
Violence. More violence. Lots of violence. (It is an action film after all.) Some extreme cases of violence include a guy getting blown apart by a grenade - not gore, but borderline. There is some profanity as well. A few cases of the ""s-h-"" word and one strong use of the ""f-"" word.

4170747,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I have to be honest, I didn't really know what to expect from this movie and what I got was a fantastically good time!

This was just too much fun!  RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous and that is borne out as you watch the action unfurl in this deliciously dark and funny comedy.

Frank, played by Bruce Willis, doesn't really like retirement all that much.  It's kinda boring after the life he'd led while working for the CIA.  The only thing he really enjoys is talking to his case worker at the Social Security office who takes care of his 'missing' social security checks which he has conveniently torn up so that he has a reason to call her.  They connect in a way he's never connected with women in a face to face situation and so they flirt and tease, giving Frank something to cling to.

And then something really strange happens one night.  A wet work team all in black shows up and shoots up his house with Frank in it.  Realizing that something's up, he hits the road to find out why someone is coming after him now that he's living a life of retired obscurity and has to kidnap his Social Security crush because she's in danger, too.

He starts looking up his old buddies from the old days, also retired now into quiet obscurity, but retired doesn't mean dead and they are all soon working together to figure out what happened to put Frank on the hot list with a bullet and then to put a stop to the plot behind the plot.

And all the while this is going on, the girl who had been harboring her own crush on Frank and looked forward to his calls to complain about another missing check finds herself having a fantastic adventure that beats anything in the pulp romance novels that she shared with Frank.

This was a truly fun and funny film with a great deal of plot twists and action to satisfy every movie tastebud in the family.

And, quite frankly, any movie where Richard Dreyfus is the bad guy has something going for it!

Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich round out this cast and it is Malkovich's portrayal of a slightly off the rails former agent who lives off grid and underground that adds the most hilarity to the movie.

4170748,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Well, THAT was the most fun I've had in a movie in a long, long time! This thing is intricately plotted, perfectly photographed, and extremely well cast! Although there was little or no profanity and no sweaty bodies, we did see a lot of gunfire, car chases and blowie uppie stuff. The audience ate it up!

First, let's talk about that cast:
*  Bruce Willis (""Cop Out"") is a former CIA black-ops agent, now he's Retired, Extremely Dangerous...get it? He's trying to deal with boredom and inertia, and has taken to calling a particular gal in a call center about a check he keeps insisting never arrived.
*  Mary-Louise Parker (""Weeds"") is that gal (see above). She reads bodice-rippers like Love's Savage Fury and dreams of having a manly man come into her life and sweep her away to excitement, passion and exotic locales. She is hilarious!
*  Morgan Freeman (""Invictus"") is another retired agent, now relegated to a nursing home where he is dealing with a terminal illness. He too, is bored and lonely; this is NOT the way he expected his life to end.
*  John Malkovich (""Secretariat"") is also part of this bunch. He spent a few years being injected with LSD, so his hold on reality is a bit shaky, but he LOVES guns, ammo and explosives! Talk about a loose cannon!
*  Helen Mirren (""The Last Station"") isn't quite as retired as her buddies; she admits she still ""takes a side job or two."" She can wield a machine gun with the best of them and still packs a yen for an agent she had to shoot.
*  Ernest Borgnine (""SpongeBob SquarePants"") should have retired years ago, but he's still working in the CIA's top-top-secret archives.
*  Richard Dreyfuss (""My Life in Ruins"") is an industrialist who knows WHY a mysterious list was made of people who MUST die.
*  Karl Urban (""Star Trek"") is absolutely perfect as a new-generation black-ops agent, every bit as well trained and deadly as his predecessors. I'm always impressed by him.

This terrific film was beautifully directed by Robert Schwentke (""The Time Travelers's Wife"") and I could hardly wait to get my DVD from Amazon.com. When every scene is deliciously shot, with guts, glamor and LOTS of giggles, we naturally look to the director. Let's keep an eye out for this guy, okay?",1317945600,8,2235,4.649746192893401

Seeing such an elegant and accomplished actress saying 'I kill people daaaling', and soon after in snow fatigues carrying and shooting a sniper rifle (correctly).... and later firing a heavy weapon in a enclosed place (and in an evening dress), is worth buying the DVD!

Then a close-up of the now forgotten Morgan Freeman's face. An eye pops open, rolling back and forth, and seeing nobody around. He gets up. knocks on his bullet-proof vest (gotten from Richard Dreyfuss's hidden room armory)...and  walks away. His death didn't belong in this lighthearted story, and he could have been greatly employed in later scenes.

All the actors were fantastic, with Mary-Louise Parker being so entertaining that even with such top box office draw as Willis, Freeman, Mirren & Malkovitch I enjoyed her scenes the most. She was just so genuine - be it really irritated or really entertained. Fantastic job.

The story has a few unique twists and turns that keep the plot moving and interesting. Lots of action (which Bruce Willis is spectacular at IMO) and plenty of humor with some drama mixed in for good measure. Malkovitch plays an excellent nut job, and Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren are outstanding as always. I have to say - I prefer Karl Urban as a good guy but he does a good job as an agent doing his job even while you don't like him very much for it. I like him more as Bones in Star Trek but not because he isn't good here - he is. Just a personal preference.

A few corny scenes, and a few over the top scenes, but well done by the director.  And whoever thought of over-the-hill action stars against youngsters, was brilliant.  I enjoyed this movie very much, as did my fiance.  He didn't hold his breath that it would be any good, and he was very surprised also.  I usually don't like John Malkavich, but would watch this movie with him in it again.  He plays a paranoid crazy guy VERY well, which he has prooved over and over.  And, I would have never pegged Helen Mirrin as a mean Momma!  She kicks butt with her scoped rifle and everything.  And both Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis have prooved that age doesnt necessarily mean only father, grandfather, and president roles.  It was wonderful throwing in Mary-Louis Parker as a love interest that gets pulled into a strange life.

Overall, I thought it was a reasonable fun outing but nothing more than poking fun at the real action movies of the 80s.

There isn't a weak link in the bunch, and a terrific script, and excellent direction from Robert Schwentke puts this near the top of my favorite movies of 2010. Quite simply, one of the most enjoyable, entertaining, suspenseful and impressive film-making endeavors I've seen in a long time. I thought, to this point, that ""True Lies"" was the most fun intrigue/action/comedy movie. This tops it, if only for the magnificent cast and unending craziness. The chemistry among all is perfect. Watching Helen Mirren kick butt is best of all. I repeat: NO END OF FUN! Great editing, photography, lots of 'splosions 'n stuff.

Frank (Bruce Willies) is a retired secret agent, he just met this girl Sara through the phone and he's living happily. However, things quickly change when a group of assassinates attack his house at midnight in order to get him killed. Now Frank Have No Idea who wants him dead, he's no longer working and won't make a threat to anybody but obviously someone wants him killed. When investigating further Frank discovers that the killers are not only targeting him, there's a list of names (with his name included) and almost everyone on that list is either killed or is going to get killed and the funny thing is almost every one of them is retired and old. Who wants them dead ? And most importantly why ? After searching further Frank discovered that all the names on that list had something in common they all were...well I'm not gonna tell you. You have to watch the film and find out for yourself !

I liked the shooting scene in the cargo, it was funny ! I also liked the scene at the end it was pretty cool. The acting was great ! I love almost all of the actors in this film. I really liked Helen Mirren she was fantastic as always ! My only Complaint is that Morgan Freeman never had enough screen time. The love stories were sweet too, especially the old couple :) and some of the jokes were actually funny even though I'm a person who laughs at actions more than words.

So if you want to see a group of retired secret agents who can still kick some a$$ in a non-corny way then I recommend you watch this, true some of the action is over the top and unbelievable but it was intended to be funny.",1300924800,,1823,4.263005780346821

The entire supporting cast was brilliant, the pacing, dp work on cuts/video edits and writing was outstanding - this is one of the better movies I've seen in recent years.  Bravo, everyone.  It's fun, it's fast-paced with action sequences and plot turns, and overall an outstanding movie.  I hope there's a sequel or two.

First: this movie is just plain fun, an action confection which coasts comfortably on the charisma of its familiar stars.  I contend that anyone who judges it really harshly is being way too serious.

And I was perfectly happy to buy a reduced-price movie-only Blu-ray release.  The DVD extras are only rarely something I'm actually interested in.  I just wanted a good-quality transfer of the feature at a reasonable price.

That's where things went wrong.  The video transfer was... perfectly okay.  But I didn't believe my eyes (and ears, once the movie started): this Blu-ray includes only nasty, muffled old low-bitrate lossy Dolby Digital audio tracks.  You know, the kind you thought were a thing of the past once you switched to a format with the bandwidth of Blu-ray.

That's just completely cheesy and unacceptable.  This film would've been far more engaging if the sound transfer had been up to snuff.",1300060800,9,1094,5.860759493670886

4170842,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Finally we have a star-packed movie that lives up to the billing. Bruce Willis is in excellent form in both the action and the comedy aspects of his character. Morgan Freeman gives his usual, excellent performance. Mary Louise Parker plays a character that, I thought, was much younger than the actress...and pulls it off without a hitch. John Malkovich is as creepy, funny, and far-out as ever. Dame Helen Mirren is, at one point, wearing an evening gown, combat boots, and firing a 50-caliber machine gun; how can a movie get any better than that!

The romantic story line shows a lot of chemistry between Willis and Parker; I hope they get to work together again because there is definitely a good on-screen harmony between them. The characters seem like a group of old friend who'd been apart for a while. The action is driven by a story that stays consistent and doesn't rely on miracles to bring everything together.

The action, suspense, and comedy is non-stop. The plot actually makes sense and I can imagine a lot of old soldiers sitting around looking at certain developments and saying, ""Yep, that's what I would have done there too."" :-)

4170843,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I have always enjoyed Bruce Willis' smart aleck persona, and this movie, ""Red"" shows Bruce at his best. As a retired member of a CIA black ops team, he obviously has deadly skills, but when it comes to dealing with dating, he's as shy as a little kid.
  The other retired characters are played with marvelous abandon by John Malkovich,as a skillful but very paranoid ex-op. Morgan Freeman is a not quite helpless nursing home resident. Helen Mirren is an elegant Martha Stewart wanna-be with a penchant for taking on the occasional ""hit"" out of sheer boredom. Brian Cox, an ex Russian spy called on to help the team, is charming as a man with more romance than mayhem on his mind.
  The acting skills of the two other main characters aren't overwhelmed by the blatant over the top acting of the above group. Mary-Louise Parker holds her own and more as the romance novel buff whose dull life and job are interrupted when she finally meets Frank (Bruce). Karl Urban is the unlucky CIA agent who has to ""deal"" with that over the hill bunch. He does a great job walking a fine line, in that he doesn't come off as a bad guy.
  Richard Dreyfuss in an almost cameo role is as smarmy as you can get playing a very weaselly bad guy. Last but not least; Ernest Borgnine plays the keeper of the secrets, both edited and unedited.
  This movie is sheer adventure with a lot of laughter thrown in. The one liners fly so often that the movie really needs to be seen more than once to catch them all. Sometimes just the expressions on Malkovich's face are enough to crack you up. Suffice it to say that these people aren't your normal Social Security pensioners.",1299974400,,1649,4.473333333333334

Morgan Freeman - one of our great actors of the last four decades, regret he was killed off did an excellent portrayal as an ailing former spook.
Mary Lou Parker - did a good job as BW love interest.
Karl Urban - the script for his part was a bit stiff for me, but acted well.

This was an interesting plot and shows possible convoluted actions of the spooks in the U.S. Government and possible lack of communications among the ""intelligence"" community.
I found the actions of the J. Malkovich character very,very entertaining and Dame Merrin is one of my favorite actors-her role as a killer was fascinating for me.
Morgan Freeman was his usual smooth self and regret his character seemed to have been terminated.

RED, is without question, a repeat viewing, non-stop, always interesting, entertainment spectacle. The writing is exactly what you would expect from a cast of Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Rebecca Pidgeon and Richard Dreyfus. It's funny. It's exciting.

This is the kind of movie that people beg for everytime they put their money on the table for the movie business to take. People don't want to be disappointed. They don't want to be bored and they want to finish the movie and still be thinking and talking about it. With RED, you get just that.

From the opening scenes of Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) reading romance novels and trying to live a normal life, making excuses to talk to an operator at the Government Pension office, despite never having met her, and into the moment where his house is flooded by black ops, you get exactly what RED is about. Fun and Action.

Where most movies these days disappoint or bore, RED doesn't do that. It does exactly what you would expect from a movie that puts Bruce Willis where he's most comfortable. It's an action movie that doesn't insult our intelligence. Sure there are some over-the-top things that happen, but most are pheasible or perfectly in place for the movie at hand.

RED is a must own because this is what entertainment is all about.",1299456000,,1441,4.775100401606426

An ensemble cast in no particular order, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine! Yes, you did not misread, Ernest Borgnine! Many would remember him from The Wild Bunch, The Dirty Dozen or Airwolf, just to name a few. Bruce plays a C.I.A. retiree named Frank Moses who becomes enamored with Sarah , a young lady who works for the Pension Department. Over the years of retirement, Frank still tries to keep in shape & keep his senses sharp as ever. For good reason, he is on a hitlist which is being carried out by his former employer, the C.I.A.!!!!
A mission from 1981 comes back to haunt Frank & everyone involved in a greater conspiracy that could see the Vice President make a successful bid for the election of becoming the next President.
After he dispatches the hit team with devastating results, he meets Sarah & takes her with all around the country, meeting up with allies & trying to get to the bottom of this conspiracy.
The mayhem, chaos & fun continues right until the end! This movie never lets up! They maybe retired but they are still the best at what they do! Based on the comic book of the same name, it's just great to see all these actors & actresses have lots of fun doing what they do best!

Though not Oscar material it is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Where it is and it isn't exactly what you thought it would be it certainly doesn't hurt the movie at all. The big surprise is that the cell is all older actors and an actress not what one usually sees in youth driven Hollywood. That being said I found it to be a nice change of pace. (Just so you know, I am 46).The acting was very good with out being over done. The action was crisp...though I am sure some of you would think that it was violent, very violent. However, it is what you would expect in a movie like this. The humor works well and is in the places where you would expect it. Again it is not over done and you never get the feeling that they are playing for laughs. It is exactly how real life would unfold. You find yourself laughing because what is happening is actually funny and in a way you can relate to it. This movie does have a story and the story does make perfect sense, you just have to let it unfold and you are rewarded. Also this movie has an excellent cast,so much better than most movies and they all do a terrific job, so much so you are sorry when the movie ends. For me Karl Urban was the draw and I was not disappointed with his performance. He actually made feel that he enjoyed every thing about giving this performance in this movie, which of course made me enjoy this movie even more.

But it was quite a treat to watch this great cast interact with each other.  The story was a bit of a stretch, but hey, if it permits the likes of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, & Helen Miren to work together in an improbable plot, then just sit back and enjoy it.

Movies like this are meant to entertain, not have the viewer scrutinize each and every scene for authenticity.  It is meant to be an imaginary flick.  For the characters to sometimes do the impossible, well, that is what makes this movie a kick to watch.

Frankly it's why I wanted to see the film in the first place.  None of them disappointed me; they all treated their roles with just enough seriousness that you never get the feeling they're standing apart and winking at the audience.  And yet you know they're having fun.  With a big, dumb, 'splodey movie like this ('splodey, adjective, -er, -est, Full of explosions) if the cast isn't having fun, neither is the audience.

Frankly, I don't recall much of the plot.  Bruce Willis has a telephone romance going with a tired, bored woman at the Social Security office (Let me pause here just to say how refreshing it was to see that his love interest wasn't some vapid young starlet, but a smart, interesting, age-appropriate woman, played by Mary Louise Parker.  There is nothing bland about this cast, not even in the love department.  High marks there.)  He's a retired CIA operative who discovers  that someone is trying to kill him.  They manage to kill his house, and he decides it's time to hit the road, pick up his sweetie, who is probably in danger, and go talk to the rest of his old team, all of whom are in danger, too.

The rest of the film is them trying to figure out the who and why of the problem, and they do it with real class.  Really, if you're looking for some tasty mind candy, this is it.",1298592000,,1453,4.353159851301116

This was a great movie solely because it was an action movie with a comedy storyline and the cast that performed it was exceptional. I would highly recommened this film to anyone youll love the action atmosphere and parts with the comedy roles, the chemisty between Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker is amazing really makes the movie.

4170900,4,B003Q6D2B4,"With an ensemble cast featuring Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Carl Urban, Sarah Louise Parker, RED is a real treat for action fans. It's a light-hearted action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, with comedy and spy thriller elements thrown in, plus a dash of romance for good measure. The actors all look like they had a lot of fun making this film and I certainly had a lot of fun watching it.

Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a former CIA operative, the quintessential bad ass. Now retired and bored, he spends his days chatting with a customer service representative at the regional pension office named Sarah (Parker), until one evening when a wet team is sent to his house to kill him. He quickly dispatches his would-be assassins and races to Kansas City to protect Sarah. Someone has labeled him RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) and Frank sets off to uncover why while evading agent Cooper (Urban), a young CIA operative assigned to kill Frank. What follows is an entertaining old-fashioned spy adventure as Frank seeks out old allies and ""gets the band together again"", including Joe (Freeman), crazy man Marvin (Malkovich), ex-MI6 operative Victoria (Mirren), and Russian secret agent Ivan (Cox).

Right from the beginning, I knew I was in for a good time when Frank takes the bullets from his assailants' handgun and cooks them on a frying pan, thus creating a time-delayed diversion. I've never seen that before in a movie. Sure, there's the main story of under-handed dealings and a top-secret government cover-up, but you're really here to see the good guys kick ass! The action comes quick and it comes often, including one ridiculously over-the-top shootout in a loading dock involving a pink stuffed pig and a woman in high-heels and an RPG!

The story isn't particularly original, but I was more than happy to go along for the ride. The retired super agents angle has already been done in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG99A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>&nbsp;and the Frank character is almost the same as his McClane in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000VNMMQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>. It's got the requisite elaborate spy-thriller heist stuff that is par for the course, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible-Three/dp/B003QQJGRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission Impossible Three</a>&nbsp;and even a twist at the end that's almost required these days-- but if you've been paying attention, this won't come as a surprise. Even with this, it's very hard to hate this film, unless you are a total grinch.

The cast consists of some of my favorite actors today and seeing them with guns blazing is a lot of fun. Watching Helen Mirren manning a .50 cal machine gun in a long white evening gown is almost worth the price of admission! Willis is typecast as an action hero and someone you would expect in the role of a tough guy, but the distinguished Dame Mirren is the very face of class and great fun to see outside of her usual roles. The only nit I have to pick is with Cox's bad Russian accent, however, he is still lovable as the hopeless romantic Ivan.

Don't think too hard or take this film too seriously, because it certainly doesn't. The film ends happily with a silly moment. I wouldn't mind seeing a RED 2 if the studio decides to make another one. A feel good movie that is very entertaining-- highly recommended.",1298073600,,3611,5.418149466192171
4170901,1,B003Q6D2B4,"This review is for the movie only blu ray edition.  I am giving it a one star rating because the movie only edition shortchanges the consumer.  As indicated in some of the prior reviews, this edition only comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track.  It does not come with any High Definition audio tracks.  Most blu ray movies typically have at least one HD audio track whether its TrueDolbyHD or DTS-Master Audio so the average consumer may not be aware of this deficiency because they've come to expect High Def audio as the norm for Blu Ray movies.  If you want the DTS-MA audio track you need to pony up some extra money to get the more expensive special edition.

4170904,5,B003Q6D2B4,"You have to kind of suspend belief at some of the scenes and situations in this action-thriller, but it was really fun to watch.

Brian Cox is great as a suave and smooth Russian counterpart.

The story is sort of convoluted and at times a little hard to figure out, but there's lots of actions and some spectacular big-time explosions that make it pretty exciting. Lots of chase scenes, explosions, tongue-in-check jokes, comedy and a good dose of romance thrown in, it's just a lot of fun.

4170907,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I love action flicks. What's even better about ""Red"" as an action flick is its cast. And this is not just any cast, but one filled only with retirement age actors (well, maybe Bruce Willis isn't quite there, but he acts as if he is). OK, maybe Mary Louise Parker isn't quite there either, but she's also excellent as Willis's love interest.

So, what's to like about an action flick starring old actors? (When one is the same age as the actors, one is allowed to call them old.)

1. Humor in an action flick? Yeah, it's been done for years--Clint Eastwood and Schwarzenegger with their punchy one-liners. This time Morgan Freeman gets the line: ""We're getting the band back together."" It was funny in the television promos--it's even funnier in context. Ms Parker expresses her extreme displeasure with the Willis characther--with her mouth duct-taped! While the viewer may not know the exact words behind her anger, her meaning is quite clear. It's an excellent delivery complete with facial expressions and perfect comedic timing.

2. Romance. Willis and Parker? Yes, and the actors make it work even though he is retired R-E-D (retired, extremely dangerous) and she is a seemingly mild-mannered, cubicle-retirement clerk. However, in their conversations together he learns the way to divine her heart. He reads all the romance novels she reads. She also has a true hankering to travel to exotic places. When she tells him she wants to go to Chile, he says he's been there. The thing with his travels is the reason and the time, often by cover of night and to relieve someone of his ugly, hateful life. He's been to Chile, but hasn't experienced Chile.

3. Larger than life characters.
Freeman has participated in Vietnam and Afghanistan and now is 80 years old (is Freeman really that old?) and living in a nice retirement home with his dose of excitement gained from eyeballing a beautiful, young aid's gluts. He also has stage four liver cancer.
Helen Mirren as the lovely, refined mistress of a country estate, filling her hours with baking and flower arranging--and the occasional hit. As she tells Ms Parker: ""I kill people.""
Karl Urban plays the adversary--a deep CIA special ops hit man. His job is to eliminate Willis's character. The reasons are eventually revealed and they are a doozy.
John Malkovich plays an over-the-top paranoid, well, an Oliver Stone type. But Malkovich is hilarious, especially showing his pleasure at Willis's storage facility filled with weapons and munitions of extreme measures.

3. An expose of the great and secret powers of the CIA. Ernest Borgnine's character and his job and its location and purpose are prime examples. But there's more.

4. Weapons galore! Fun with weapons! An example: one soldier shoots a grenade at Malkovich who uses his weapon to bat it back to the soldier who then is blown up. A fierce, red-headed, female agent calls Malkovich Grandpa. He must show her what ""grandpas"" can do. She shoots a small missile at him--he shoots a bullet from a handgun directly into the center of that missile, causing blow back of the explosion and getting rid of that potty mouth agent (older people don't like being reminded of their age!)

5. A serious message amid all the shenanigans: the abuse of power in whatever place for whatever reason. Richard Dreyfus plays--with great flair--a powerful villain and how his power has distorted whatever tenuous connection he may have with the human race.

6. Quirkiness (but I suppose part of the humor)--Mirren wears a lovely, long white evening gown to a presidential party bid. Later Malkovich gives her a pair of combat boots to wear for their role in taking down the powerfully corrupt. Just a little quirky! Malkovich's house is inside a car. Let me rephrase. One enters his dwelling through the trunk. That's all I'll say.

7. I could put Brian Cox in any category. As a retired Soviet spy who hasn't killed anyone in years, he is almost a scene stealer.

What a fun, fun movie (despite the various forms of violence). There's only one kiss, no, make that two (Freeman gets one) and just a few I love you's, giving this action flick a touch of heart.",1297814400,2,4152,4.835211267605634

4170910,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I think you'll get many, many laughs out of RED. In the comic spirit of most of the James Bond spy movies that starred Roger Moore, this film has a great  daffy story that will make you feel almost satisfied with its ending.

It stars a wonderful ensemble cast of your favorites and mine--Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren--playing aging, retired spies who are confronting a powerful enemy. Mary-Louise Parker as the love-interest is a comic delight in a different way, Brian Cox is quite amusing as a very helpful elderly Soviet spy, and  Karl Urban does an excellent job in his role as an intense young adversary. It is great to watch the gang (including senior citizen Ernest Borgnine) going through their various schticks.

The movie is based on some graphic novel I've never heard of, but neither have most other viewers. If I had to guess the authors, I would immediately pick that well-known team of old-timers who used to work for the Ethiopian Ministry of Information--Haile Implausible and Haile Amusing.

SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: As in SPACE COWBOYS and ARMAGEDDON, one of 'em dies to save the others, and I won't say who or when or how--but if you know the movie industry's ""rules,"" you can guess 1/3 of this.

At this, the film excels spectacularly.  It concerns the retired (extremely dangerous) CIA agent Frank Moses, who one night finds a hit squad in his house.  Determined to track down who's behind the attempted hit, Moses rounds up some old friends, and together they decide to take on the CIA and potentially the entire US government.  Sound like a good time?  You bet it is!

Without the spectacular cast (all of whom are delightfully hamming it up), the film would still be enjoyable.  With this cast, it borders on one of the best action comedies of recent years.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich are all top-notch as retired agents with a little bite left in them.  Joining them for the ride is a delightfully cool and sinister Karl Urban, as the man pursuing Moses; Marie-Louise Parker, charming and hilarious, as Moses's love interest; Brian Cox as a former Russian spy; Ernest Borgnine as a records keeper; and Richard Dreyfus as a shady businessman.

The characters are two dimensional, and the plot is shallow and convoluted.  Various plot holes aren't resolved, and the trailers gave away a lot of great moments plot details (though don't worry, there are still plenty of others).  These may seem like minor things in an action movie, but in a film with this great a cast, you notice them.  That's the only reason RED gets 4 instead of 5 stars.  Otherwise, it is an upbeat, fun, funny action film, one of those rare pieces of popcorn entertainment that warrants repeated viewing.",1297555200,,1694,4.776632302405498
4170918,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Yes, the plot isn't all that fresh, but so what.  It's quite funny, and the casting is great.  While I loved all of the characters, I think Mary Louise Parker shines with her loopy, adventure-deprived conversion to mayhem and chaos. If you want dark reality, watch Patriot Games, Day of the Jackal or any other of many.  This one is entertaining and amusing.  Having had an uncomfortably close stint of employment with the secret squirrels in Washington DC, I can assure those who care that the excess of paranoic, law-defying, unquestioning sociopaths and psychopaths in all the various permutations in what is now euphemistically called Homeland Security is far from off the mark.  If the average Joe Citizen had any idea who's supposed to be defending our righteous way of life and what really goes on, he/she would fall on his/her sword.",1297555200,,841,4.894366197183099

Bruce Willis plays Frank Moses, an ex CIA agent whose file has been stamped RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous.  He lives a quiet life on a quiet street, ripping up his pension check just so he can call in and speak to the lovely Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) at the Pension office.  They talk about books and traveling, and then Frank's house gets shot up by the bad FBI guys.  Frank kicks butt and gets the heck out of there.

After picking up Sarah, who might find herself in trouble with the CIA just for talking to him, he sets out to find why he's suddenly become a target.  Along the way, he reconnects with some old, but deadly, colleagues played by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. Together, they find out the black-ops are out to kill a list of people who were present in Guatemala when the now Vice President committed war crimes.  With his plan to run for President, he needs to get rid of some dirty laundry, and Frank's name is on the laundry list.

John Malkovich is superb as a crazed gunman who fears everyone is out to get him - the government, the web, the satellites, the helicopters flying over. The government tests involving daily injections of LSD back in the day didn't help much!  The gun chases are over the top hilarious thanks to John, his big guns, and classic one liners!

Morgan Freeman is...well, Morgan Freeman who never disappoints.  But Helen Mirren, a bread-and-breakfast flowering arranging, meal planning, elder is also a deadly assassin who loves to kill people.  She's also in love with their Russian adversary who has always wanted to kill a U.S. President, played by highly versatile Brian Cox.

This is a movie not intended to be taken too seriously.  The big guns and big explosions often had me laughing out loud at times because the characters take the action very seriously, and you can't help but laugh at the old Western-like face offs. See this movie for the unbelievable cast, and for its hilarity.

Bruce Willis followers won't be disappointed, although Bruce's character is a bit reserved this time. There's not a lot of classic emotional connection in the storyline between you and the characters or with between the characters themselves, but that's okay.  You'll still walk away like you've just had a great day at an amusement park.

I'd give it 4 stars for entertainment value, 4 stars for action, and 3 stars for writing and plot.",1297555200,,2673,4.60126582278481
4170921,4,B003Q6D2B4,"The best thing about this movie is the subtle but funny dialogues. For example, when Bruce Willis asked Helen Mirren ""Aren't you bored of the retirement life?"". She answered ""No, I enjoyed it. I do take the odd contract on the side"". She meant sometimes she took a contract to kill somebody! There are other dialogues that are far more tickling but I don't want to spoil the movie by revealing them here.
I prefer this kind of jokes than the in-your-face one.

There are also a lot of actions.

In short, it's hilariously entertaining and it deserves 4 stars. I own it.",1297468800,,569,4.514563106796117
4170922,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Bruce Willis is back doing what he does best: action-comedy. The movie opens with Willis getting up as the clock turns to 6:00 AM with no alarm. This quick opening scene shows us his orderly life. He rips up his retirement checks just so he can talk to a woman in Kansas City on the phone, whom he has not met, but has a fascination. Played by Marie-Louise Parker she also writes bad spy romances which Willis reads. As Willis gets up too early, his sixth sense is working, a group of men attempt to kill him. He heads to KC and kidnaps his would-be gf. As it turns out the CIA is trying to kill him for something that happened in Guatemala in 1981. The bulk of the movie is to figure out why and to stop it before they get killed.

The dialouge has a dry wit to it. For example when Willis takes a bullet:

Parker: ""This is bad.""
Willis: ""People get shot all the time.""
Parker: ""No they don't. They normally get paper cuts.""
Malkovich: ""I normally get shot.""

The film moves at a good pace and really gets fun when Malkovich shows up. John was a former CIA operative who was given LSD everyday for 11 years. He is quirky and paranoid.

Ernest Borgnine: Plays a CIA records keeper.
Karl Urban: CIA agent hunting Willis.
Morgan Freeman: Former CIA agent, part of Willis' group.
Helen Mirren: Also a former ""wet"" agent. Retired and complex. She enjoys baking, arranging flowers, and killing.
Richard Dreyfuss shows up near the end as a bad guy arms dealer.

As in most modern action films, impossible things happen. But then that is what makes them fun to watch and we all expect it from a Willis film.",1297468800,,1600,4.373737373737374
4170923,5,B003Q6D2B4,"The word ""red"" is an acronym describing the Bruce Willis character, a retired CIA operative, who remains extremely dangerous. Willis telephones Mary-Louis Parker, a CIA financial clerk, frequently and is attracted to her. He is surprisingly attacked suddenly by a group who try to kill him. But Willis is no ordinary retired operative and is very competent in combat. He overcomes his attackers.

 He realizes that the CIA, or some element in the organization, wants to kill him. He understands that the attackers will go after Mary because of his many telephone calls to her. He discovers that other CIA operatives, all associated with one particular mission, have been killed. Despite his abilities, he needs help to find who specifically is trying to kill him and his associates and why.

 He rescues Mary and gets help from past CIA operatives who were on the mission: Morgan Freeman, an eighty-year old man living in a nursing home and dying of cancer; John Malkovich, whose mind has been somewhat fried because of his involvement in LSD government experiments: and Helen Mirren, who is a good medic and an expert marksman. He also seeks aid from a past Russian rival, a friend of Helen Mirren.

It's good that Hollyweird is slowly realizing some of the most ingenious writers working are writing ""comic books"". They have been for decades, in fact, and Red makes the case for their many skills quite well. This script is excellent, with many many very funny lines and set-ups. The direction is likewise solid, and every actor here is clearly having a great time and taking none of it too seriously. Malkovich especially proves again and again that he is one of the most underrated comic actors around; between this and Burn After Reading you've got to give the guy serious props.

We laughed a lot and were entertained throughout Red. It's nice and tight and doesn't go on too long, and in general Red is one of the more enjoyable action/comedies I've seen in a long time. The blu-ray transfer is very very crisp, and made the outstanding effects and interesting shots/angles even more fun to watch.

Red the film on the other hand is a surprisingly enjoyable and breezy comedic action flick that boasts an impressive cast and sharp production values; all of which culminates in a surprisingly good comic adaptation.  Bruce Willis stars as retired CIA badass Frank Moses who, along with his would-be prospective girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) becomes targeted by his former employers.  Soon enough, Frank enlists the help of some old friends and allies (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox) as he dodges the determined young agent (Karl Urban) who is hot on his tail.

I have no problem with the idea of having tiered levels of pricing for what you get (though I have to question the wisdom for everybody of having say, 3 different Blu Ray sku's for toy story 3), and even lo-res audio would be ok if it is CLEAR what you are getting...if you were being given an informed choice. And if the ONLY difference was audio, then you'd make an informed decision vs. the special edition, but no, it appears that its the other stuff that differentiates the two versions.

4170935,4,B003Q6D2B4,"There are two things you should know before watching ""Red."" The action-packed film is nominated for Golden Globe best picture for comedy/musical category (and this is not definitely a musical). The other thing is that the action comedy has great players including four Oscar winners (Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren). With this stellar cast, things just can't go wrong.

The story itself, loosely based on the graphic novel created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, is not original. A retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), now living alone, is suddenly attacked by a heavily armed hit squad. To survive and uncover who is pulling the strings, Frank goes to New Orleans, tracking down the clues while being chased by the current CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) bent on killing him.

Bruce Willis is fine as the retired agent who hasn't lost his touch, but it is Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah, an unsuspecting customer service agent for Moses' pension (and possible love interest), and John Malkovich as Marvin Boggs, ex-spy and conspiracy theorist, who steal every scene they are in. Plus, Helen Mirren firing a machine gun is something you shouldn't miss.

Obviously the film greatly benefits from the talents of the players, who seem having fun. The direction of Robert Schwentke (Flightplan, The Time Traveler's Wife) is not particularly inspired, and the wrap-up is too neat and tidy like the Jodie Foster thriller, but the director keeps the ball rolling throughout.

The fact that this plot was so implausible didn't bother me all that much (after all, that's why it's a movie). And there is a limit to how bad anything Morgan Freeman is in can be. But on the other hand, the characters in this movie just weren't well developed. What is quite the word for when

Now living a very uneventful life, Frank finds solace and companionship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker), a seemingly bored customer service representative. Monthly he uses the excuse of his checks being issued in the wrong amount to work his way into her life. After an attempt is made on his life, the unknown enemy decides to kidnap his new love interest and use her for bait, which inevitably turns in a game of cat and mouse. Determined to rescue her and discover the truth, Moses visits other retired agents seeking their help. And what a group of talented actors, who each brought an authentic quality to their roles (with the exception of one that I will mention later). Joe (Morgan Freeman) is living in a retirement home, literally dying and this seems to be an opportunity for some last minute fun. Victoria (Helen Miran) is enjoying her life as a simple woman (who once put three bullets thru the man she loved simply because the agency wanted her to) and would remind you of a loveable but deadly grandmother. Paranoid, conspiracy theorist Marvin (played by the delightful John Malkovich) is only to willing to show Moses how the present events are related to a past transgression of someone they know.  Ivan (Brian Cox) is simply willing to spend time with the woman who he has never stopped loving, even if she shot him (3 times) and left him for dead. There is the devoted and dedicated CIA Agent who will stop at nothing to get his man. And finally, there is the very shady Alexander (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not what he appears, and who believes that he single handedly has created the Vice President (Julian McMahan) who is destined to be President. Both are willing to stop at nothing in an effort to protect a secret. Eventually, Moses figures out why they all have been scheduled for elimination and works hard to reveal the truth.

I thought that this was a decent movie with a great cast. However, I did struggle with the final rating and ended up giving this movie a 3.5 to 4. I tend to rate it higher because the fabulous actors made me overlook the defects in the storyline. The only character that I was never sure about was that of Sarah. I kept thinking that the final twist should have been that she was an agent meant to seduce Moses but also learn the truth (or something...more), instead she just seemed a little too simple lacking the same depth that the other characters. She moved from wanting to get away, to falling into line wanting to participate in a dangerous adventure. I don't know, she was the only character that I really didn't like, which was hard since she was the center of the storyline. Perhaps another actress would have made the character more likeable for me. Anyway, I definitely would recommend this for someone who is looking for just the right amount of humor and adventure.",1296691200,,2904,4.669921875

4170953,4,B003Q6D2B4,"This is the CIA's version of Space Cowboys. You have a group of old, retired agents who are thrust back into action in order to solve a conspiracy.

Red stands for Retired, Extremely Dangerous. It stars a stellar cast of greats: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban and Morgan Freeman.

Bruce Willis is a lonely ex-agent who finds himself in the cross-hairs of a special wet team. Wanting help, he grabs his old team, Malkovich, Mirren and Freeman, in order to discover who wants them killed and why.

Karl Urban plays the CIA agent in charge of their disposal.

There are some wonderful action moments and John Malkovich is as funny as ever. He is the best part of this movie by far.

I felt jilted by the Morgan Freeman character - or at least how his character was dealt with.

It almost feels like watching the 80s version of Bruce Willis and his movies of that decade where there's serious explosions with a high mix of laughs while they don't quite take themselves seriously.

I really can't understand why any of the previous reviewers saw fit to complain that this wasn't an in-depth, emotionally driving story.
It's an ACTION MOVIE, and it's GOOD.  The fight scene between Franks and Cooper alone was worth it, and that's just about the midway point of the movie.  John Malkovich was hilarious, Helen Mirren was perfect as always, Brian Cox was a surprise, as I didn't know he was in it, but he was great, too.  Karl Urban was a real selling point in this movie and just further proves that Karl Urban needs to be in more movies, preferably physically assaulting the crap out of someone.

4170956,4,B003Q6D2B4,"RED is an excellent movie, as most other reviews will tell you.  I am mainly leaving this review to let everyone know that the special edition extras are not worth paying for.

- The deleted and extended scenes are mostly just slightly longer versions of what is already in the movie and are not very interesting or funny.

- The trivia track is a major let down.  Instead of fun behind the scenes trivia about the movie, you get some random facts that are remotely related to what is going on onscreen.  It's almost like at the last minute they decided they needed a trivia track and so they had some high school kid grab words from the movie and google them.  Seriously, here's one of the first ones -"" the color red supposedly makes people hungry.""  Very lame.

- There is a section that interviews some of the talent, but they pretty much just gush about how great it was to work with the other cast members.  There is no cool info about how they filmed anything or where, or how any of the special effects were done.

- The inside the CIA feature is also very basic last minute stuff.  They detail several things from leaked CIA documents.

The bottom line is that the movie is excellent and worth buying, but the extras are very poorly conceived and executed.  Either they forgot about extras until the last minute and decided they could get a few more dollars by adding some or they are planning on coming out with a super special edition that actually has some decent content.

The action was artfully balanced with humor (Bruce Willis vacuuming!)as a suspenseful plot unfolds that actually had me on the edge of my seat in spots. Watch for the Karl Urban fight scene and Richard Dreyfuss as a rich sleezeball. Ernest Borgnine rounded out a sparkling cast in a couple of brief appearances. The only disappointment was the limited role of the ever cool, calm, and collected Morgan Freeman but this was was offset wonderfully by John Malkovich's hysterical antics.

The RED cast is free of female action figure stereotypes.  Both Helen Mirren and Mary-Louise Parker participate fully, each in their own manner, and yet never loose their warmth and femininity. Even the agent who faces off with John Malkovich in one scene is ""real"".  Refreshingly, there is no ""sexploitation"" in RED.

Apparently not in the film RED. Bruce Willis playes a retired agent who is suddenly a target for termination by the very people who employed him and they will stop at nothing to see him dead. Even if that means getting your butt kicked many times over by the guy you are instructed to kill.

RED is an entertaining hysterical ride. The cast is awesome, getting some of the most well known drama/action stars of the past 25-30 years to fill the roles of government assigned assasins in their golden years is nothing short of brilliant. Morgan Freemen delivers priceless one liners, John Malkovich is flat out hysterical and Helen Mirren....well all I can say is holy bejezus! Of course I have to say the rest of the cast was great. Karl Urban is really showing us that he is a great actor post LOTR. He does exceptionally well in these comic book adaption films and now it has been announced he will be playing Judge Dredd in the much needed re-dux. Brian Cox and Mary-Louise Parker also did a great job, though I didn't expect anything less. Probably the biggest surprise was Richard Dryfus...just because I haven't seen him in a movie in like FOREVER!

4170975,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Shouldn't stir up a hornet's nest, that's just asking for it. Frank Moses is a retired CIA wet works operative trying to fit a normal, if lonely, life in the 'burbs. But when Frank reaches out to a bored federal pension service representative named Sarah, when he tries to step out of his hermit's existence, somewhere in the paranoid bowels of the CIA, a red flag goes up. One dark night a CIA-sanctioned hit squad invades Frank's home. Frank Moses's top secret personal dossier is stamped ""RED"" - for ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous."" They should've brought more hit squads.

And now Frank Moses is all sorts of curious as to why a kill team was deployed against him. Off he goes looking for answers, low profile all shot to pieces.

If you've read Warren Ellis's repressively bleak, gritty comic book RED, this movie adaptation'll surprise you some. With an eye towards a more audience-friendly product, the screenplay expands on and switches it up some from the original source. Three things stand out immediately and notably. The tone is more lighthearted, tongue-in-cheeky, and not as violent. Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker, really good) - who this time isn't Moses's case handler - achieves more camera time. And, unlike in the comic book in which he's strictly a lone wolf, Moses has a team to assemble. Or as Morgan Freeman's 80-year-old, liver-cancered rest home retiree remarks: ""Well, we're getting the band back together. That's nice."" And maybe you can't teach old dogs new tricks. But these old dogs have perfected what tricks they do have. Today's CIA asshats have a job and a half trying to curb these - to steal a phrase from Holly Golightly - ""mean REDs.""

The absolutely top notch cast is what makes this film so much fun to watch. It's worth the price of admission just to see terrific old pros like Willis, Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren at play. These actors create a marvelous synergy. They even sort of channel that old Rat Pack cool. Bruce Willis still has the chops to pull of that action leading man role. And, to quote Warren Ellis: ""Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?"" One of the most amusing tidbits divulged in the special features is that Mirren patterned her assassin character after the immaculate Martha Stewart. Karl Urban, fresh off knocking everyone's socks off as the re-imagined Dr. McCoy in STAR TREK, makes a credible - and even likable - antagonist. More old far+s get dusted off for cameos, such as Ernest Borgnine as the CIA's venerable records keeper and Richard Dreyfuss as a sleazy CEO of a defense contract company.

RED, with its brisk cross-country jaunts and its root-for-the-badasss-geriatrics theme and its consistently entertaining beats, is also just off-kiltered enough to make it seem fresh. There's this light capery touch which graces even the film's most generic shoot-'em-up sequences. Given the caliber of the cast, RED would've had to work overtime to stink up the joint. As it is, it certainly made enough of a killing at the box office that a sequel is in the works.

Of course, it's no Love's Savage Secret.

The Special Edition DVD's bonus features: audio commentary by retired CIA Field Officer and RED consultant Robert Baer who gives revealing insights regarding the film's plausibility (and implausibility); 10 Deleted & Extended Scenes, including a funny scene which supplements the film's closing moments of Frank and Marvin on a mission in Moldova (00:08:49 minutes long); an optional running RED trivia track in text captions throughout the film: ""Cast Insights"" - 14 segments covering topics such as set and location shoots, action sequences, the awesomeness of the cast, and even Helen Mirren's Georgio Armani purse (totaling 00:29:15 minutes); and ""CIA Exposed"" - disclosing past, previously secret CIA operations, including one project which focused on experimentation with cats (totaling 00:05:59 minutes).",1296259200,3,3917,5.037037037037037

I suppose the people in Summit Entertainment's marketing department thought they were clever when they came up with the idea of a blu-ray high definition movie coupled with a compressed dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  People do not pay close enough attention to the available audio tracks when purchasing a blu-ray for it to have an influence on their decision between buying the regular or the special edition of the movie.

The marketing tactic isn't causing people to spend the extra money for the special edition to get the HD audio, it is just upseting them when they discover that they have been cheated by Summit and purchased a blu-ray with compressed audio.

One character I found very endearing was Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox), the long lost love of Victoria (Helen Mirren). He was so charming and I kept wondering who the actor was.

After I watched this, I immediately viewed the movie I had accidentally rented, Red (2008). It's a brutal, sad and touching story that I'll never forget. And then when I did my usual ""actor search"" afterward, I was totally blown away by the fact that Brian Cox was the star of that film.

The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke.  But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment.

Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!).  Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins.  It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people).  At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President.  The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar.

The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations.  This is not a deep film but a movie that will entertain form the first frame to the final rather surprising episode.  It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!

4170989,4,B003Q6D2B4,"First and foremost, do NOT pay any attention to the 1 star reviews that are complaining that they couldn't take the time to check the difference between the reg. edition and the special edition so they were upset that the basic version was in Dolby sound and not HD. They aren't rating the movie at all. They are only rating it 1 star based off their own frustrations.
On to the movie:
Extras:
This is a fun to watch, a bit over the top but fun to watch film. In the behind the scenes they talk about how everyone brought their A-game and it made the others step up and be competative which made for a fun movie to make. You can see the sincerity in their interviews that even the top stars were enjoying working with the other stars in the film. At first, you may say, ""There are very few special features. Why is this a special edition?"" Well, the special edition has better audio/sound and I guess that's it but in the extras menu, it has only 3-4 extras but once you go into these options, it opens up many more short behind the scenes, interviews and much more. It looks like very little extras but there's more there than it looks like.
Movie:
By ""over the top"" I meant that anyone with any military or spec ops experience will say, ""Um...you can't do that"" at a few points but it's a movie and don't look too much into the somewhat exhagerated parts and you'll really enjoy this movie. One example is, you can NOT continually fire a 50cal machinegun without letting go of the trigger. You have to fire in 3-4 round bursts or you'll melt the barrel and it will seize up or worse. Small stuff like this might annoy some people but just watch it and enjoy.
There are a lot of great one-liners and Malkovich (Martin) gets some of the best lines. Although Bruce Willis (ex-CIA) can be called the star, Morgan Freeman (ex-CIA), John Malkovich (ex-CIA), Helen Mirren (ex-MI6), Brian Cox (ex-KGB?), Karl Urban (CIA) and many more are all written so well that they all steal scenes at one point or another.
Karl Urban is the younger CIA agent that is on the trail of the retired (RED) operatives and as the movie progresses, I found it very well written that even though he is slowly learning that maybe these guys aren't the bad guys, he does his job no matter what. He still chases them, looks deeper and deeper into the situation until he finally finds out the truth.",1296000000,3,2368,4.396355353075171
4170990,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Got to put im my few words about the blu-ray edition of RED. There must be a few different versions out there. People spending twelve bucks and expecting a top blu-ray release and transfer...go rent it instead! Does the phrase ""you get what you pay for"" sound familiar? The 'cheaper' movie only is not to be aimed at people that are into high quality, top notch blu-ray transfers. This is aimed at the people who 'just want to see the movie in other than DVD format'. This explains the single layer pressing with non-lossy audio. For a few extra bucks get the special edition and quit crying already!! You are giving this product a bad rap because you make bad choices by getting the cheapest version out there. The special edition I have is a flipper disc, which I know are trouble, with DVD on the flip-side. The blu-ray played without a glitch. Don't know if the special edition Amazon offers includes DVD or not, but I do know that the special edition is pressed at a much higher bit-rate than the cheap movie only disc. And it does include a DTS-HD soundtrack that really rocks!!! Plus it has great special features (including an all access pass).
So don't be mislead by the bad reviews of the movie-only edition and get this special edition and leave your brains at the door and you will have fun!

4170991,5,B003Q6D2B4,"I've been a fan of Bruce Willis for some time now. From his first major appearance on MOONLIGHTING through the DIE HARD films, I've made a point to see his films when they are released. When I heard that he was starring in RED, based on the comic book of the same name, I was anxious to see how it turned out. And while it plays loose with the source material, it ends up being one of my favorite films from last year.

The story revolves around Frank Moses (Willis), a retired ""Agency"" assassin living a boring life that has become far too routine for him. To pass the time he calls Sarah Ross (Mary Louise Parker), the woman who handles payments to retired employees of a company she only knows as legit with no clue as to his past. Each month he calls to tell her the check didn't arrive, even though it did, and the two have a conversation. Both are bored and lonely and strike up a phone friendship.

Unfortunately for Frank the ""Agency"" monitors all of its ex-employees designated RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) and don't take kindly to them making consistent phone calls. Rather than assume nothing despicable is going on, they're more prone to think secrets are being leaked or some other nefarious plot is in the works. So they send a strike team to take out Frank one night. But as his designated retirement status claims, Frank is not someone you should mess with. The team is taken out and Frank is on the run.

His first stop is to find Sarah who he realizes he has accidentally placed in danger. Rescuing her and with her still not quite ready to believe his story, they head out to find other members of his old team. Like conspiracy minded Marvin Boggs who thinks everyone is out to get him played fantastically by John Malkovich. Then Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) who welcomes the chance to escape his retirement home for some action like the old days. And finally there is Victoria (Helen Mirren), set up in peaceful tranquility...with the exception of taking on the occasional assassination.

Brought back together by circumstances the team is on the move to find out who it was that authorized the hit and why. On their tail is ""Agency"" man William Cooper (Karl Urban), a top notch agent who could be Frank's match. If it wasn't for the fact that Frank taught Cooper's trainer everything he knew...but not all that Frank knew.

Crosses and double crosses flow throughout the story as the team follows one lead to another in an attempt to find out just who is behind the uproar. Everyone from a weapons manufacturer (Richard Dreyfuss) to the Vice President become suspects but it isn't until the final moments that we discover just who the culprit is.

Along the way there are plenty of explosions, jokes and hand to hand combat moments that should keep Willis and action fans sitting on the edge of their seats. By the last reel you'll find yourself wishing that the movie hadn't ended and that another was on the way. Thank goodness the rumor mill has it that their planning a sequel.

The action is non-stop, the effects are top notch and the acting is some of the best I've seen. To me the best acting doesn't involve the ability to simply say your lines in the most dramatic way possible. Instead, the best acting is when you completely forget the fact that you're watching a movie, that the person performing is an actor and you totally believe that for two hours they ARE that person. Such are the performances by all involved here.

But best of all with this movie is the fact that for 111 minutes you are entertained. And in the long run isn't that what it's all about? No, this film will not find most involved nominated for any Oscars but the truth is that some of the most entertaining films made never do. Instead they find fans who watch the film over and over again. This is one of those movies, a film that I for one feel I could watch more than three times and never be bored with. And that makes it a movie worth watching.",1295913600,,3963,4.502086230876217

4170993,3,B003Q6D2B4,"The strongest part of this movie is the cast. Its really good to see this group of actors playing together and they do a good job with what they have. When you first start to watch you think the movie is a serious action movie, but you soon realize there are a lot of comedic elements to the overall story. Some are funny, especially when it involves John Malkovich, while the rest detract from the movie. Its almost like the movie cant quite figure out whether it wants to be serious or funny, and mixing the two doesn't quite work.

The story itself is nothing special, but the talented cast does a good job with it. The special effects are pretty good, though I questioned how they made going after the vice president look so easy. Overall RED is a good movie to watch if you just want to see a decent action movie with a few laughs, but don't expect much beyond that.",1295913600,3,871,4.310975609756097

4170996,5,B003Q6D2B4,"To begin, I rated this movie five stars not because its one of the best movies I've ever seen, but because, in my opinion, its better than so many of the movies released in 2010.

Compared to the other oldie action movie of 2010, The Expendables, RED is a clear winner.
As others have said; we know, and probably mostly love, the cast. Being British, the delightful performances of Helen Mirren and Brian Cox were going to make this a winner for me, and Karl Urban always impresses me.

Philip French in The Guardian (a British newspaper) reviewed RED and said 'This is painting by numbers for people who have trouble with mental arithmetic.'  No doubt if, like Mr French, you only enjoy watching obscure Kenyan arthouse movies then RED isn't for you.

There's a measured amount of comedy, a great fight scene between Willis and Urban, and will probably be remembered for Helen Mirren in a white ballgown firing the belt fed machine gun.

The DVD release is decent, but I wish they'd put a little effort into making some limited editions for us collectors.

I wish Amazon would keep reviews of the blu-ray release seperate from DVD reviews, although those of us buying DVDs can laugh this time around as the blu-ray buying fools pay almost double for a movie only release with mere DVD quality sound (those 1 star reviews).",1295913600,2,1323,4.656652360515022

4171002,1,B003Q6D2B4,"The movie is a quality no-brain popcorn flick.  However the blu-ray release comes in two flavors, barebones and special edition.  This barebones (movie-only) edition has lossy quality audio most commonly found on DVDs.  With the conception of blu-ray two lossless audio codecs were introduced DTS-HD MA and Dolby TrueHD, the special edition utilizes the DTS-HD MA codec.  The lossy audio makes this product a 1 star, blu-ray is HD and putting a product out that isn't both HD audio and HD video is an attempt at fooling the customer; shame on Summit.  The special edition would get a 4/5 star from me as it has HD audio, DTS-HD MA (just an FYI for those reading this review when it shows up on the special edition blu-ray page).

Recently I read a great metaphor for lossy versus lossless compression algorithms.  Basically lossy is how you can take a photograph in its RAW format and compress it into another form such as JPG.  The file becomes smaller because bits are thrown away, the image still looks good enough when viewed in certain ways but those bits cannot ever be retrieved. Lossless compression is like when you ZIP a file on your computer, when you unzip the file all the bits are still there.  So basically lossless audio codecs allow all the audio information to be present for your system to utilize them, making them sound more definitive and crisp because all the bits are there!",1295827200,97,1398,4.720164609053498

4171005,4,B003Q6D2B4,"What's the selling point of RED? Stars you like doing stuff you like, mainly shooting things. At this, the film does very well. And fortunately, the things it doesn't do very well don't detract from the film that much.

Granted, the plot is incomprehensible, and the supposed twists at the end will have you thoroughly scratching your head, but most of the main plot points at least have an interesting action setpiece surrounding it. Also, I had a big problem with Morgan Freeman in this film, as he gets second billing, but is in the film a grand total of 10 minutes. He's good during those 10 minutes, but it's little more than a glorified extended cameo, since he doesn't really factor into much of anything very much. I mean, was he too busy filming Thick as Thieves or any of the other myriad straight-to-dvd trash he's been involved with in the past decade? Sorry, just had to get those off my chest.

Still, RED mostly makes it up with a great cast and creative action. It's hard to tell what Bruce Willis phoning in a performance is anymore, but here he's just Bruce Willis, and the results are pretty nice. He's still believable as an elite assassin type who can best men half his age, and he pulls the romantic aspects of the plot fine as well. Which brings me to Mary-Louise Parker who while I've never been a particular fan of, does a good job as the cute government customer service girl dragged into this crazy conspiracy. She's charming and funny, and while she isn't exactly asked to do a lot, she does a very good job with what she has. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are appropriately cute together. Karl Urban sounds exactly like Dr. McCoy as a CIA agent, but he's actually quite likable despite some of the more cliched aspects of his character.

Still, none of them quite reach the level of John Malkovich having a helluva good time as the LSD-dosed paranoid agent who serves about 85% of the comedic beats of this action comedy. He really gives a lot to the role, giving the appropriate amount of crazy to make this character, who at one point charges at the Vice-President with a fake bomb strapped to him, really funny and memorable. He has a lot of great lines, he has some good action beats, and he's given a lot of great stuff to play off of, mainly his pink pig.

As for the action, it has a lot of creative over-the-top sequences, never too far apart, to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. There's the awesome Bruce Willis stepping out of a moving/spinning car while shooting a guy scene, but the scene taking place with a bunch of cargo crates probably takes the cake. It's fairly short, but it exemplifies everything to like about the movie. There's general craziness (using a gun as a bat to toss back a live grenade), very creative and satisfying moments (the grenade launcher hitting the first guy was particularly great), and then of course you have the explosions and a good Malkovich one-liner to top everything off.

Overall, if you know what to expect, and it's really not that hard to know, you should have a pretty enjoyable time watching a bunch of older actors kick butt. It's pretty accessible to most anybody if you want a good date movie, action movie or comedy, and judging by the reaction in my theater audience, it's also quite the crowd-pleaser.

4171010,1,B003Q6D2B4,"I was horrified to see that this atrocious film averages a four star rating. I felt obliged to provide an honest and critical account of what must easily rank as the worst movie of the year, if not the decade. It just goes to show how Hollywood has gradually eroded our capacity for critical appraisal and evaluative thought. This awful movie is one enormous cliche based around a series of pathetic and obvious jokes that sound like they were written by a seven year old. In some cases the script is so vapid that the other characters respond to what appears to be an attempted witty one-liner by staring blankly at each other. It is so far fetched and absurd that it is not even entertaining in a weak and obvious Benny Hill sort of vein (not that I like Benny Hill).

It is astonishing that there are adults out there who uncritically lap up the drivel that ""great"" actors sign their names to, just because of who they are. Yes, Helen Mirren is a superb actor who has played some magnificent roles. That doesn't excuse the appalling tripe dished up in this dreadful corker. Contrary to the beliefs of her gulllible and undiscerning fans out there, great actors are not infallible or super-human. I am not generally a huge fan of Bruce Willis and I am sorry to say he did nothing in this movie to alter my opinion. He was smug and uninspiring, but at least he was consistent - there was no evidence of any acting at any stage in the movie.

It does make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside to know that people thought this was a ""fun"" movie, despite the fact that it was mindless, predictible, pointless and boring. It gives me hope to know that I could scrape together a half-arsed excuse for a movie with a preposterous plot, bland performances and vacuous script. I would then stock it full of 'big names' and make millions of dollars out of it by selling it to the unsuspecting public who ostensibly accept anything that the big names regurgitate into their laps.

A victim of my Scottish heritage, I rarely walk out of movies and thereby waste my investment in the ticket price. However I was compelled to walk out of Red in order to avoid the zombifying effects of this cinematic black-hole. In fact, I could feel my brain-cells self-immolating in protest faster than the vast quantities of sugar I was eating to try and stay awake could destroy them.

Karl Urban was a great addition.  I look forward to seeing him in other roles outside of Star Trek again.  Especially, the new Judge Dredd film.

Ernest Borgnine was a very welcome addition to the cast.  It was good to see him acting again.

You want a fun 1980s/1990s action feel of a fun pop corn movie?  Then go see RED.",1290988800,13,950,4.205555555555556
4171017,5,B003Q6D2B4,"Retirement sucks, as anyone can tell you.  For former black-ops CIA agents, the inactivity would drive a person insane.  Bruce Willis (Frank Moses) is suffering from that insanity.  He's a loner, his house lacking all the essential necessities to make it a home, and he's bored out of his mind.  He doesn't know how to blend into the neighborhood, pitifully viewing the landscape for what is expected. His desperation, his loneliness, and the inactivity of retirement leads him to tear up his retirement check and call an ever patient, equally lonely customer service agent in Kansas City.  The conversations with Sarah (Parker) are the highlight of his month and, through these conversations, he attempts to become more 'normal'.  Someone should tell Frank that a man reading a romance novel is not considered 'normal'.
This retirement that eats at Frank's nerves is shattered when a hit squad attacks his house in the middle of the night.  Frank, as skilled as ever, kills the assassins.  Decades of training leads him to believe they have tapped his phone lines, and he's off to Kansas to save his phone buddy Sarah. Her reluctance to be saved (imagine someone you've only ever spoken to being in your home when you come back from an excrutiatingly boring date!) causes Frank to kidnap her.

Sarah goes on a wild ride with Frank while he attempts to discover who is trying to kill him and why.  He travels cross country to find the members of his old black ops team, who are all equally retired and bored to death. Meanwhile, the viewer discovers the CIA is the machine behind the attempt on Frank's life.

Morgan Freeman (Joe Black) is at his suave self, living in a retirement community and suffering from stage 4 cancer.  John Malkovich (LSD paranoid Marvin) hides in tunnels and carries a stuffed pig under his arm.  Helen Mirren proves that mature women can be sexy carrying a high powered rifle,and arranging flowers in a Better Homes and Garden style home. Her comment about taking an 'odd job on the side' still makes me laugh.

This is an all-star cast of superb actors that deliver an action-packed, fast paced, comedic, and highly entertaining film.  The twists and turns are thrilling. I loved every moment of it and it proves that even the retirees have a magnetic bit of life still left in them.",1290729600,15,2312,4.773869346733668

Review Date: 08 November 2010

Recently numerous movies have shown us great actors can make ridiculous material wildly entertaining. MacGruber, Machete and now Red have all been absurdly obnoxious, but their cast has kept them in the realm of the best films of 2010.

Let's start with THEE action star himself, Bruce Willis. Surprisingly enough, he's not a cop this time! He's Frank Moses, an ex CIA operative being hunted down by a league of bad guys who make Swiss cheese out of his house via machineguns. Naturally Frank walks away unscathed and we are left wondering: who would send so many dudes to shoot up a house rather than just one to blow it up?

The answer to that is found in Red's tone, which is: because it looks cooler. The charm of Red is that it knows it's absurd but it wants to be, and it also knows how to be absurd but cleverly entertaining at the same time. Oh, and if you are wondering why it's called Red, well that stands for Retired Extremely Dangerous; see what I mean?

Frank has been flirting over the phone with a phone operator named Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and in doing so does two things an action hero can never do without serious consequences: he speaks on an unsecured line and he falls in love with a beautiful woman whom the bad guys will inevitably capture and hold at bay.

This happens of course, but it's not the chain of events that holds our attention, so much as the journey we take with the characters in getting to those must-have action moments. For instance, not having time to explain that more bad guys are about to break down her door and kill her, Frank kidnaps Sarah; and this is their first meet I might add. Then they head off on an amusing road trip in search of assistance and information from a league of Frank's old counterparts who include Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.

Next to the gnarly bad-ass-ness that is Bruce Willis in anything he does - the Malkovich character was my favorite. Malkovich plays Marvin Boggs, a paranoid gun toting hermit who lives in a kind of underground fall out shelter, accessed only by - well, I can't reveal that; it's too funny and I've said too much already. Just know that you will love Malkovich's off the wall and canny portrayal, and that he gets 90 percent of the laughs. Shocker, I know.",1289865600,4,2683,4.629473684210526
4171019,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Government pensioner Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) lives a dull life in a quiet suburb of Cleveland.  His principal amusement is romancing a bored pension clerk named Sarah (a superbly cast Mary Louise Parker) over the phone.  One night, a squad of black-ops agents breaks in.  Frank mops the floor with them, revealing astonishing black-ops skills of his own.  On the run, he kidnaps the rather willing Sarah.  Turns out Frank Moses is ""retired-extremely dangerous"" and the CIA, for some reason, wants him dead.

Frank hunts up some old comrades (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren) to find out why they are all being targeted.  Frank will also get help from an old Russian adversary (Brian Cox) and an old records keeper (Earnest Borgnine in one of his last film roles).  Frank and his buddies will have to stay one step ahead the very capable young CIA operative William Cooper (Karl Urban).

At the heart of the story is a ridiculously complicated and hilarious plot full of black helicopters and corrupt officials.  The fun is in watching a nicely matched collection of gifted actors roll through an action-comedy while reeling off Cold War jokes, clich&eacute;s, and sight gags.  Highly recommended as good fun.",1289692800,,1228,5.0
4171020,5,B003Q6D2B4,"genre. A stellar cast of, shall we say, senior citizens? Led by Bruce Willis playing, Frank Moses, a wry, Retired Extremely Dangerous agent who still has his skill set. The CIA is trying to kill him, collegue, Morgan Freeman & others for some unpleasantness that occurred in Central America years ago. So they set out to find out who & why. Early on Frank acquires a younger girl friend played by Mary Louise Parker. She is unwilling at first but they are trying to kill her too so she becomes an enthusiastic participant. The trail led to the vice president who turns out to be a master-mind criminal. So it is decided to kill him & prevent him from becoming president. They enlist killer John Malkevich & retired assassin for hire Helen Mirren. I've never seen such a sexy senior citizen manning a machine gun. She's the #1 reason I went to see this movie. They all ourageously ham it up but they are so good the plot hardly matters. Massive mayhem ensues as the bodies pile up. The violence is a bit cartoonish & this will never be mistaken for art.
  It is really escapist fare, highly entertaining & you get your money's worth as it runs 111 miutes, long for this type movie. I lost myself monentarily while watching it. It won't be long after it's run that it will be on dvd /blueray. Excellent.",1289606400,8,1301,4.485232067510548
4171021,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I couldn't help but compare ""RED"" to the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"".  Both are comedies centered around preposterous CIA plots, and both feature John Malkovich.  For ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous"" I only lament that the script spent more time setting up a ridiculous plot than giving its' A-List cast dialogue worthy of 3 Oscars (Morgan Freeman,Helen Mirren and Richard Dreyfuss) and 2 Emmies (Brian Cox and Malkovich).  Mary-Louise Parker gives one of the best performances in the film as a government clerk who gets dragged into the life and death spy game only because Bruce Willis' retired character takes a shine to her.  Karl Urban gets the thankless role as the CIA henchman leading the black ops team trying to exterminate Willis and company.

The plot is entirely too ridiculous to be taken seriously, but the film is also a little flat taken strictly as a comedy.  I'll split it down the middle and say it's worth watching if it comes up while you're on a plane, or a rental on a ""we're bored"" night, if only to watch these excellent actors look like they're having a quite good time.",1289433600,,1103,4.778947368421052
4171022,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie has several of my favorite things... Bruce Willis, CIA flavor, lots of action, and a light, humorous tone... I have signed up to be notified when it comes out on DVD... LOVED this movie!",1289260800,,197,4.5

4171025,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Who cares if it is completely preposterous, Red is great fun all the way.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss and Helen Mirren all increased their net worth through signing up for this movie, and all have a great time.  Several here have argued that it is Malkovich who steals the movie, and when he first appears dressed in some kind of leafed out camouflage, he's off to a great start.  But he has by now taken out the patent on controlled psycho persona, so my vote for most fun goes to Helen Mirren.  It isn't every day that you get to watch The Queen wield heavy weapons with aplomb from a leafy Maryland retirement house, but she does it and makes smashing entertainment with it.  Never mind the plot -- it has something to do with the vice-president or perhaps the evil mastermind (Dreyfuss) manipulating the vice-president somehow subverting the whole of the CIA to their nefarious ends -- because Red is played for entertainment and laughs, not plot sense.  It is a great way to spend a Saturday night, in theaters or at home.",1288915200,,1063,4.627659574468085
4171026,4,B003Q6D2B4,"Sometimes you watch a movie and sense that the actors had as much fun as the audience. This is one of those. Won't change the world, but it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. You'll have a good time.",1288742400,,210,3.9069767441860463
4171027,4,B003Q6D2B4,Bruce Willis may be old but he sure doesn't act like he's over the hill.  Karl Urban's performance didn't disappoint either.

4171028,2,B003Q6D2B4,"In matters of taste there is no dispute and by giving this abomination a 2 star rating I'm bound to arouse the ire of those who love Bruce Willis, Action-Adventure etc.  Nevertheless, I personally think this film stinks.  In many ways the plot is a rip-off of the equally lousy 'Shooter'.  In both films impossible violence against the CIA and the U.S. Government is justified by the slaughter of vative villages--in Ethiopia ['Shooter'] and in Guatemala ['Red'].

Anyway, it seems that Willis, Freeman etc. [senior citizens all] are more lethal, dangerous and well-armed than were 50 Clint Eastwoods.  These guys are real terrors.  They mow down equally well-armed and far more numerous CIA men without getting hit themselves [of course].  Standard Action-Adventure fare, if you think about it.  Shell casings pile up in their thousands and the dead in their hundreds.  Willis is the 'most interesting man alive.' to quote a well-known commercial.

To make the Hollywood point even further, a Russian agent/KGB is a terrific guy who helps our guys against the evil U.S.  Drip, drip, drip.  He always shows up where he isn't expected and just in the nick of time.  Amazing.

Obviously this dreck cost quite a lot of money to make--well-known actors and plenty of special effects.  The film's lack of any real quality must rest directly on the shoulders of brain-dead writers and their director/producer promoters.  Then again, maybe they aren't that brain dead.  Some kids, who claimed this movie was 'great', got me to buy their tickets.  I was an unwitting accomplice to the subversion of our youth.  Shame on me.",1287964800,8,1615,4.9812734082397006
4171029,4,B003Q6D2B4,"I mean, anything that features Dame Mirren, an elegant evening gown, and a .50 cal machine gun can't be all bad. Once you stop taking it seriously (something sure to happen early on), it's a riot.

The basic message is a boomer ego-stroke: ""Don't mess with the old guys."" Unfortunately, that's what happens. Retired CIA agents start dying at an alarming rate. It turns out that the decedents all worked on the one particular mission - one that Our Heroes worked on as well. So, when the hit men come after the hit men, the chase is on. And, as it progresses it reaches higher and higher into the halls of government. You know, the usual.

In this movie, the fun is all in getting there. Bruce Willis's wise-cracking plays well against John Malkovich's slightly deranged character, Morgan Freeman's easy-going character balances them both, and Helen Mirren adds a touch of class. Then there's Mary-Louise Parker's character, Sarah, in a role like Diaz's in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knight-and-Day/dp/B002ZG9864/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knight and Day</a>&nbsp;only not as ridiculous. Keep your ears open for the one-liners. There were enough times I was the only one in the theater laughing that I might have been the only one listening, too.

OK, maybe this isn't one for the ages. It's a heck of a way to spend a Saturday night, though.

4171030,5,B003Q6D2B4,"When I first saw the previews to the movie, I was honestly unsure if I wanted to see it only because the movie seemed to be scripted to former CIA agents that want revenge. While it is fine to have such a script, I was wondering how exciting it was going to be. Then they showed the preview of John Malkovich saying ""Old my (you know what) shooting at a younger assasin who seemed to be in for the shock of her life after realizing that he had more fighting ability than initially realized. It was then I decided to see it because something about that scene made me realize that the movie was going to be more eventful than what I was seeing in the trailer. Fortunately, I am glad that I decided to go with this feeling. This movie has a strong all star cast of actors and actresses featuring Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich who end up going on a ""adventure/preserving their life mission"" after finding out that very powerful people in government want them dead for some reason. From my perspective, The plot was a combination of dark comedy and action. The two actors that stood out the most for me in the movie were John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.  Helen Mirren stood out because she plays a strong and self confident former CIA operative who is ready at a moment's notice to go on ""the odd jobs here and there"" whenever she is needed. I like that she plays a very assertive and powerful person who knows what she wants. She also seems like the type of person that is comfortable and happy with herself in real-life from the strong performance she gave in the movie. I am a college student who is obviously from a different generation than she is, but I am inspired by Helen's example and intend to be an extremely self-confident person by the time that I reach the life stage that she is in now.  I enjoyed John Malkovich's performance very much because he played a gifted but extremely paranoid former operative that was frequently looking over his shoulder for perceived threats in a very powerful and with the right amount of forceful manner. As it turns out, his paranoia many times is justified. He really adds excitement and humor to the movie in his role as a talented but guarded former CIA operative. The best indicators I can say is if you like your movies with a mix of dark comedy, action, drama, and suspense then chances are good that you are going to enjoy this movie.",1287446400,,2414,4.471655328798186
4171031,3,B003Q6D2B4,"I never read the comic books, so I couldn't compare it. I didn't really like this movie as well as I thought I would. There were a few decent action scenes that caught my attention. The rest of the story just has them talking. Frank Moses, Joe Matheson, Marvin Boggs, and Victoria are retired CIA agents. They are soon targeted for assassination. They must team up and work together to figure out who wants to kill them and why. Frank brings along a woman named Sarah who is his 'sorta-kinda' girlfriend. Don't expect too much while seeing this movie. If you want a bland action film to only see maybe once or twice in your life, you might like RED!!!",1287360000,,651,4.433333333333334
4171032,5,B003Q6D2B4,"This movie has it all. It's got:

- Lots of action. Even though Bruce Willis is playing an older, retired guy, he's still got the goods. He's completely convincing. The rest of the cast delivers as well.

- Funny moments - While it's not a continual thing, there are plenty of funny and light moments, with a few of laugh out louds. Willis is the master of action flick funny, and John Malkovich was surprisingly hilarious. The rest of the cast contributed well as straight guys.

- Romance - Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker really work. I don't want to ruin any surprises, but lets say it starts out and ends in a surprising way, and they had good chemistry.

- Character development - Surprisingly well done for an action flick. Each character was really defined, and you get to care about them.

- Suspense - It was really a good story, and well written. It was full of twists and surprises, with plenty of ""edge of your seat"" moments.

- Outstanding cast - The star power in this movie was blinding. These people really shined. They're not stars for nothing. Each person was fantastic in their role.

The beginning of the movie dragged just a bit, but once it took off, it really flew.

It was a really enjoyable movie. We recommend this movie highly, however please don't bring your young kids as one family in the theater did. There's too much violence for children.",1287360000,145,1376,4.565040650406504
4171033,4,B003Q6D2B4,"""Red"" (Retired Extremely Dangerous) is an action/adventure/comedy about four former CIA operatives who have never quite lost their addiction to adrenaline.  During the opening credits, we observe a bored-looking Bruce Willis, who plays tough-as-nails Frank Moses, eating breakfast, working out, checking his mail, and chatting with a woman over the phone named Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) whom he would like to get to know better.  It is Christmas season and every house is festively decorated.  Suddenly, all heck breaks loose as a team of assassins closes in on Moses's house with enough firepower to destroy a city block.  Who is targeting Frank and why?

Eventually, Moses teams up with his old buddies, Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and the still sexy Victoria (Helen Mirren), all of whom are highly-trained former operatives with an encyclopedic knowledge of firearms and explosives.  Since Frank has shown an interest in Sarah, she is dragged into the mess.  They criss-cross the country trying to elude their pursuers and find out who is behind all of the mayhem.

This kind of satirical movie is extremely difficult to pull off.  Director Robert Schwentke tries not to wink at the audience too much, and the old pros play their parts amusingly, only occasionally going too far over the top.  The script by Jon and Erich Hoeber, based on a graphic novel, is insubstantial, and there are quite a few scenes of cartoonish violence.  Since the screenplay is not exactly Shakespearean in scope, you will need to put your brain on hold.  So, why should you see this film?  If you have a free afternoon or evening and do not mind a bit of escapism, ""Red"" is an enjoyable diversion.  Willis and his colleagues seem to be having a great time playing off one another and poking fun at the kind of character whom Bruce Willis portrayed so well during his salad days.",1287273600,10,1885,4.942857142857143
