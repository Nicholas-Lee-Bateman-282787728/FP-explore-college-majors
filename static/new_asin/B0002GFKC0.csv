8027909,4,B0002GFKC0,"Lis (Russian for Fox) is a good cop who was wrongfully sent to jail. Years after, he comes out and his only goal is to find the bad guys who put him there. At the same time, there is another story of several mafia groups that try to gain control of each other's territories. The third story involves a trio of drugged psychos who shoot people for fun, fear no pain and dream of going to Valhalla (Viking's eternal feast) after they die.

As Lis wanders the streets figuring out a plan of revenge, his closest friend and mentor is killed by the Valhalla trio. Now, Lis has to get involved with the mafia men shooting each other as well as the crazy killers. Only, Lis is doing it in the name of justice, because he is the Anti-Killer.

I am Russian hence I watched the movie in the original language. I had to watch it twice. The first time I didn't pay close attention to the film so ten minutes into the story I was lost. All characters have nicknames, they look similar and it all gets very confusing. However, once I got the characters figured out, I actually found the story very interesting and engaging. I must also note that the story is a close representation of what was going in Russia in the mid-1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union when so many people got involved in ""business"" and crime.

The film has a few shooting scenes and car crashes. There is a good balance of action, dialogue and special effects, and there are no sappy love stories!

You will love Gosha Kutsenko's acting (he's playing Lis). I would recommend this movie for a fun viewing. Don't forget to check out the sequel, too.",1137974400,2,1610,4.39261744966443
