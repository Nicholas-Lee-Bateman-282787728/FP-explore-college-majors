8124506,3,B000FL79HG,"This British series involves a young recently married couple who move from the city (London?) to the bride's small country village, which is populated by eccentric and quirky types, the weirdest one being her obnoxious and domineering brother who makes it his mission to humiliate and torture his new brother-in-law, the character played by Dylan Moran.  The pranks they play on him are over-the-top, and would make any sane person head right back for the city, even if it meant forsaking his lover.  But, being the committed husband, Dylan hangs on and tries to fit in with this tight-knit community.  He starts a photographic business, and begins to get some clients.  But the aggressive brother-in-law and his gang hose down the photo studio in another prank.  I'm not too thrilled about the casting of this particular actress as Dylan's wife.  But all in all I recommend this film if you like Dylan Moran as a comedic actor, which I do very much.  With that said, the real gem is his series ""Black Books,"" which is fantastic and not to be missed.  So, buy this dvd if you are gaga over Dylan Moran, and wish to see more of his work (not much of it is on dvd).  But do buy ""Black Books"" too so you can see his real genius shine.  By the way the dvd format is PALS which is not compatible with USA dvd players.  But you can still play it through your laptop using a cable from the laptop to your HD TV.  The series ""Black Books"" IS available in the USA's ntsc dvd format.",1304553600,8,1473,4.455223880597015
