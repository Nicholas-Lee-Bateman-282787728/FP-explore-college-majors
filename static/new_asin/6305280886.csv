This is a film that is professionally done, expertly acted and directed, and is something you want to watch to be taken down into the depths of humanity, and eventually be (for a minute) reinvigorated with hope.
This isn't a ""popcorn"" movie, or a ""crowd-pleaser"" or anything like that.  This is something like you haven't seen before.  And, it's completely UN-ARTSTY FARTSY stuff that after you've seen it, won't forget it.
It's a story of a person who eventually discovers his humanity & compassion in the midst of taking over someone's life who instead of responding with helplessness in her predicament, shows unexpected strength & resilliance.  This strength of the victim is the source of energy that the main character acknowledges early, but takes a long time to act upon.
It's a tragedy, but it doesn't totally depress you.  Well, it doesn't HAVE to, if you are deep enough to appreciate your own situation.
Dan Reed does VERY WELL in his role as the kidnapper.  I bought the DVD just to see him act (and I wasn't disappointed) but I was more impressed with Kim Pope (the chick on the DVD cover) who surprised me with an incredible multi-layered ability that I didn't expect.
I bought this movie only because Dan Reed ... acted in it.  I now don't consider it to be a novelty, but a good work of art.  No kidding.
At the price here, it's worth buying.  When you get it, be prepared to be affected.  If you're looking for a movie like ""ET"" then go somewhere else.  I totally enjoy movies like ""Toy Story"", ""Independence Day"", and ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  This DVD is nothing like those three, but worth the price none the less.",996364800,6,1741,4.638436482084691
