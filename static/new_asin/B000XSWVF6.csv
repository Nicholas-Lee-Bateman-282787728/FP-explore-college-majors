3005985,5,B000XSWVF6,"We have multiple Barney videos and this is my daughter's absolute favorite.  Not only is this entertaining, but it is also educational.  They discuss the different dances that each country does, as well as the food and celebrations that each country has.  Being a dancer for my entire life, I was even impressed with this video and its choreography.  Tracy, Ben, Barney, BJ, and Baby Bop travel around the world to experience all the different celebrations.  Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro has little ones doing the Samba.  Ireland has 4 incredible Irish dancers doing ""Riverdance"" style dancing.  (Everyone that watches it is simply amazed at their footwork!)  Then they go to Japan, Africa, and India, all the while showing you their dances.  A couple of the songs are the same (""If You're Happy and you Know It""....""We Like Colors""....), but that's it!  This video is well worth the money!  My daughter figured out how to change the DVDs, and I think she scratched this one, so it won't work anymore.  I actually came on to buy another one and to tell you just how great this video is.",1244678400,2,1084,4.707446808510638

3005987,5,B000XSWVF6,"As you may know, I was disappointed with Dino Mite Birthday. However, Celebrating Around the World makes up for it with the Imagination focus back in Barney. Anyway, this new release (that's right, it's not rehashed) has Ben and Tracy trying to figure out what to do with their party and Barney helps by taking them to all sorts of countries to see how they celebrate, like Carnaval in Brazil and Saint Patrick's Day in Ireland. If you and/or your child love Barney, I'd highly recommend this video.",1203033600,10,499,4.681818181818182

8229504,5,B000XSWVF6,"My daughter is obsessed with Barney.  Thank goodness we have access to get this movie for her via Amazon video.  It makes it so easy to watch over and over.
It's such a cute movie that I don't mind watching again and again with her.  The songs are great and upbeat and she loves to sing them.
It is full of great moral messages just like all other Barney shows.
This is a really cute movie and well worth watching.
We love Barney!",1454025600,,430,4.156626506024097

It teaches good values and is fun for little ones to watch.  I would recommend it for children 5 and under, after that they seem to leave Barney behind.",1430092800,2,287,4.2592592592592595
