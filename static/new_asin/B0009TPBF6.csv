8066486,3,B0009TPBF6,"RE: Lehar - Giuditta. DVD Morbisch Seefestspiele

Given the high prices this performance gets on various sites I would caution those interested not to pay too much for it. I agree with other reviewers that there is not likely to be another DVD of this wonderful operetta so it is worth getting to see the staging. However, the performance while undoubtedly pleasant enough for those sitting out in the audience on a warm evening is not likely to earn much repeated viewing.

First the singing is merely competent not very stirring. Because of the nature of an open air performance performers wear head mics. Thus one is not hearing their natural voice but a wireless amplification of it. (Wireless mic'ing is much less sonically adequate than a wired mic.) Above mezzoforte the sound definitely becomes congested and slightly hard. The acting, staging and lighting has to be somewhat broad stroked given the distance of the audience from the stage. There is a decent amount of chemistry between the two leads but other performers are not memorable. It also has to be acknowledged that current performers simply aren't inside this repertoire the way those performers from the 30s to 60s were. The last point where truly idiomatic performances of Lehar's operettas could be done was in the early 80s with Gedda, Rothenberger etc. So if one loves the operetta wait for a reasonably priced copy to appear.",1401321600,,1401,4.932203389830509
