The good news is that it has beeb retrieved from copyright limbo and will soon be offered on dvd courtesy of Joel Bakan and wife Rebecca Jenkins.",1413590400,2,276,4.431372549019608
7865965,5,630426688X,"I've owned this vhs tape for years and have watched it over and over again.  I had difficulty finding the movie years ago and remember I had to special order it from a video store. My vcr player doesn't work now and I SO WANT to get this on dvd.  The music is fantastic and the story line is so compelling.  Please, let someone make a dvd of this.",1393113600,2,347,4.0
7865966,5,630426688X,"I recall watching this at the movies and fell in love with every character, the storyline, etc.  There was nothing about this movie I DIDN't like!!  The music was great, the acting so natural and it all takes place in a time when there was a lot of sorrow in the world.  Wish, oh wish some company would put this out on DVD!!!!  I'd buy it in a hearbeat (I bought the VHS years ago, lent it to a friend and never got it back.....sad!)

7865967,5,630426688X,"This is a great movie to watch with your children when you wish to discuss ""the homefront"" back in North America during World War II.

The changes and the sacrifices are implied, clearly enough, as are the lingering effects of the Great Depression.

The story line is plausible, poignant, yet in many ways, gripping.

The photos of the rural great plains of Canada are something that city-dwellers should observe.

I don't understand why such great movies don't have greater success at the box office.

(Maybe it's the good tastes of Amazon reviewers?)",1254096000,,552,4.956521739130435
7865968,5,630426688X,"Based on the real life experiences of her Mother, Anne Wheeler weaves us a heartwarming and bittersweet tale of love and courage and loyalty on the Canadian prairie homefront during WWII.

Rebecca Jenkins shines as Daisy, heading up a solid cast in this little hidden gem of a movie. Why on earth is it not on DVD???

I was lucky to find the (toe tapping, heartlifting) soundtrack on cd at a local thrift store. I continue to scour thrift stores for the videotape, as I cannot afford these INSANEly inflated prices sellers are asking online.

If you stumble across a tape, or happen upon one of the rare tv screenings of this Canadian movie, do yourself a big favour and watch it. Be prepared to ever afterwards sing the songs, especially the catchy original tune ""When I Sing"" (by Bill Henderson). You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'lll sigh... And you'll also wonder why it isn't available on DVD.",1237939200,5,894,4.681528662420382
7865969,5,630426688X,Not bad! This was a good love story. I enjoyed the movie. It did need to have more of Michael Ontkean in it.,1175472000,,108,3.739130434782609
7865970,4,630426688X,"I first saw this movie on  Canadian TV and fell in love with it!  I've since seen the movie 8 or 9 times over the years and am always moved.  It's a wonderful story with absolutely great music.  There is a soundtrack but hard to find.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves the old classic type romances. Even though this is a modern production they don't depend on sex, nudity or filthy language.  The producers seem to understand that the audiance might have an imagination and not have to be shown everything in detail.",1127260800,3,540,4.459183673469388
7865971,5,630426688X,"A movie about choices and chance, with wonderful music and performances -- and one of the most erotic moments in movies (in which there is not only no nudity, but you can't even see the people). Well worth watching multiple  times.",962409600,3,231,4.634146341463414
