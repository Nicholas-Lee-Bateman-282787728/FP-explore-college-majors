8728673,3,B000PMGNAO,"Reno 911! Miami attempts to take the characters of an excellent television spoof of Cops and put them in a movie seen here on DVD in widescreen. Unfortunately, the overall feel is that you're watching an extended episode of the TV show; and it's just not as funny as I hoped it would be. It's like being on a plane that taxis down the runway only to stop abruptly at the end, never actually taking off. Ay!

When the Reno Sheriff's department is invited to a law enforcement convention in Miami, they all travel--by bus--to the city. Naturally, when they get to the convention these Keystone Cops are denied admission because ""they're not in the system."" After the whole convention of police officers becomes trapped in the center because of a biological attack, the cops from Reno are the only people who can save the day.

Look for some funny moments with several members of the Reno police force. There are a few good laughs when Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) tries to find out whose face she had tattooed on her breast one night when she was drunk; and Deputy Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash) does her best work not with spoken lines but with her ""faces."" Raineesha and Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenney) have a silly conversation while on Miami Beach patrol; and Deputy Travis Junior (Robert Ben Garant) has some funny moments when he attempts to woo a young lady for some romance.

Overall, fans of the television show Reno 911! will enjoy this movie somewhat more than people who have never seen the show before; but even for them there's likely to be some disappointment here. The film just doesn't work as well as it should have worked; and I'm left wondering why these talented people couldn't have done a better job.",1346976000,,1745,4.714754098360656
