But why do wildlife documentaries these days.... Have. To. Be. FEAR BASED (and so dramatic!?). Between the constant ominous background music and a narrator who sounds like he's doing a trailer for a horror film, these films had such potential to highlight how amazing and thrilling it is that we have animals literally thriving in some of the most densely populated places in the world. Instead, the films begins with terrorizing images of leopards attacking dogs, snakes coming through toilets, elephants goring cows, and shaky footage of animals ""gone wild"" around humans. Granted, the film has some cool footage and decent, general information about urban wildlife, but why does it have to be SO dramatic and initially scary? National Geographic needs to go back to the days of David Attenborough (with documentaries full of beautiful music and thoughtful dialogue) and drop this overly dramatic style of story telling. I'd like to think that many folks will walk away from these films appreciating our urban wildlife, but I have a feeling many will be terrified the next time they hear a coyote howling in their neighborhood.

Next time- more education about how to coexist with wildlife and LESS fear-based, dramatic imagery!",1477094400,,1417,5.187772925764192

This gave me the opportunity to share some real information to her in a consumer friendly way.  You can share this with people and let them see the connection between what they make take for granted and reality.  Great stuff.  Also, this can not be duplicated.",1441929600,,373,4.426470588235294
