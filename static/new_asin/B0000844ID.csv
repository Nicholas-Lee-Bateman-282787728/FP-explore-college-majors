1825778,4,B0000844ID,"Interesting story line, the cousin who isn't the cousin arrives at the house and promptly turns the entire house and Blair's life upside down... and Linda Blair is a draw, but Lee Purcell is the star of this movie. Actually, I found Linda Blair to be so whiny I almost rooted for Lee Purcell! (Blair has a very nasal whine throughout the movie, and it is really annoying...) but her family and her friends and boyfriend treat her very badly and very unfairly in favor of Purcell, who is, far and away, the more attractive of the two...for a time. Then her real self emerges and...but you have to see the movie! Good, light, semi-scary fun.",1058659200,5,639,4.517241379310345
1825779,4,B0000844ID,considering this is a 70d flick its still quite creepy and the sound and video quality of the dvd is great. One wonders why Linda Blair ever dissapeared from the screen. she is always so good to watch and such a natural actress,1053907200,3,227,4.3023255813953485
1825780,5,B0000844ID,"This movie is typical 70's B horror, which makes it a classic in my book.  A bit cheesy, but hey...that works.  A very early Wes Craven flick about Cousin Julia and the ""strange"" incidents that seem to occur since her arrival.  Hmmm!!  This movie scared ...me in the 70's.  And for nostalgic reasons, I still enjoy it.  Also, look for a very young Fran Drescher in it, as well.  Enjoy!!
If you like 70's horror, here are a couple more to look for, but good luck finding them, as they are currently out of print.

I couldn't believe how horrilbly cheesy this film was!!  Linda Blair is very annoying in this film, from her grating voice, to her 1970's afro.  I know that it is a 1970's TV movie, but that's no exuse.  Salem's Lot was from that same era, and it had some decent scares to it.",1051056000,3,421,4.346153846153846

I have to admit it's not too bad for a TV Movie. Very Tame...but swell casting...You really can't go wrong with Linda Blair and a slueth!

1825785,4,B0000844ID,"the 4 stars are more to reflect my suprise at how well the dvd looks and sounds, than for any extravagant extras on the disc or the implication that its actually a great movie.
i remember seeing this on tv when it first aired and i quickly developed a crush on Miss Blair, even though she was a much older woman at 17. its great to finally see this again after all these years. But unless your under 10 (even 10 yr olds are more sophisticated now and would probably sneer at this), most likely the only way you'll appreciate this, is if you are a fan of hokey supernatural plots ( where the main character always seems to know someone who has expert knowledge in this arcane area and just so happens to live down the street) or a fan of the leads.
Artisan, who generally makes a mess of all their truly classic titles on dvd (the just released Pursued is very disappointing a/v wise) actually did a great job with this one. apart from several shot that vibrate oddly for several seconds there isn't really anything to complain about. the soundtrack has been sweetend to a quasi- 5.1, and the picture looks a bit sharper and more colorful than silmilar product from this era.
now if they can just release a boxed set of Isis & Shazam on dvd...",1045440000,3,1242,4.357758620689655

1825798,1,B0000844ID,"The item was incorrect.........as I didn't notice it being Italian source, not in English, no English lines and not even playable in the US.  The DVD would not even play on any machine as it is meant for europe or someplace.  To send it back would cost more than the refund.  If at least it had English subtitles it might have been some consolation.  Although I would take the blame for ordering the wrong item, because it was part of a multi..order of several DVD's sent to be a gift, it was not quickly apparent to be of Italian origin and unusuable.

1825799,2,B0000844ID,"For those renting this because it's a Wes Craven film, be forewarned - it may be a Wes Craven film, but it's made for TV (and 1970s TV at that), so it has none of the Wes Craven trademarks. ive years after The Exorcist, Hollywood (in this case television) was still trying to capitalize (and unsuccessfully) on a post-Exorcist Linda Blair. Older and pudgier, she certainly had done nothing in the intervening years to hone her acting skills. Not really worth the time.",1358726400,,468,4.650602409638554

1825801,4,B0000844ID,"After Wes Craven made the groundbreaking ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"", he fell into a bit of a rut before finally finding his footing again with the 1984 classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". ""Summer of Fear"", the film I will be looking at today, is Wes Craven's third directorial effort. It's an ambitious effort to say the least but how well does a made for TV horror movie stand up 30 years last?

The story is about a girl, Rachel Bryant (Linda Blair), who lives with her wealthy family in a nice house in the hills of Northern California. After her mother's sister, brother-in-law, and housekeeper die in a horrible car crash, the couple's daughter, Julia (Lee Purcell) comes to live with them. Julia seems a little shy if anything, but as time goes on, she begins to put an alluring spell over everyone she meets, pulling all of Rachel's family and friends away from her. After finding some odd things that belong to Julia (including a human tooth and burnt hair from Rachel's dog Trickle (for the movie the dog was changed to a horse due to Blair's love of horses and the name of the horse was Sundance instead of Trickle), Rachel begins to suspect that her cousin may be a practitioner of witchcraft, and she's hell-bent on turning Rachel's life upside down. Her open disbelieved suspicions caused her to become an outcast in front of her family.

Ahh...""Summer of Fear,"" what a strange movie. Wes directed this voodoo/jealously movie for ABC in the summer of 1978. Well, like I said it's a very, very weird movie. The plot has something to do with this evil girl from the south that is sent to live with Linda Blair and her family after her parents die in a car accident. Of course, she's the ""cousin"" that no one in the family has seen in years and that no one really seems to remember. I know, I know...predictable...but try to follow me. After she is sent to live with Linda, all hell breaks loose as this evil girl tries to take over Linda's body or something (this is never really made clear). The special effects are corny, the editing choppy, and the acting is mediocre at best (wait till you see Fran ""The Nanny"" Dresher as Linda Blair's nasally best friend) and yet I still kinda enjoyed this picture. It's solid, fun, campy horror that never takes itself seriously. Go into it expecting a run-of-the-mill teenage made-for-tv movie and I think you may be pleasantly surprised.",1322870400,5,2411,4.591647331786543
1825802,4,B0000844ID,"I saw this movie when it first came out and a few times since then.  I read the book as well.  I always loved it and I wasn't disappointed this time.  It had been about 15 years since I last watched it and I thought I might be disappointed as is the case sometimes when your memories of old flicks are foggy, but it still held up.  It was even a bit ""edgier"" than I remembered.  The plot is good, the acting not too bad, and it has the right amount of creepiness to it.  The one thing that did distract me was Linda Blair's hair...OMG...it was huge.  Didn't remember that (probably because mine was as well!).  I did enjoy watching and my boyfriend, who had never seen it before, liked it as well.  I really miss the 70's and 80's low-budget horrors.  They just don't make them like that anymore!  Definitely worth seeing if you're into movies from this time period.",1312848000,5,866,4.283950617283951

1825804,4,B0000844ID,"In SUMMER OF FEAR, Linda Blair (THE EXORCIST 1 and 2, BORN INNOCENT, HELL NIGHT) stars as a squeaky-clean gal who suspects that her cousin (Lee Purcell) might be a witch. Watching this, it's difficult to believe that it was made by the same director who gave us LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET! Wes Craven does his best w/ the silly 70s TV medium. As watered down as it is, SOF still manages to be fun. Check it out, just don't expect to be terrified!...",1280534400,4,497,4.242105263157895

1825815,4,B0000844ID,"I really enjoyed this considering it was in the bargain basement (most of them aren't uusually worth picking up).  I was forewarned that the front cover-art had nothing realling to do with the film (ie. skeleton).  When I looked at the back of the cover and saw some of the scenes from the film with Linda Blair, I vaguely remembered seeing this years ago on TV.

I finally watched the DVD the other day and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's one of those films that you cannot take seriously, but just treat it as a bit of escapism.  While the storyline is totally far-fetched, the acting makes up for it.  Lee Purcell was great as the cousin who is nothing but a nasty witch.

This 1978 movie turned out to be an enjoyable afternoon's viewing.  Worth a look (just don't take it too seriously).",1137283200,5,789,4.468531468531468
1825816,3,B0000844ID,"I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars if i could.

A demon mama shows up at Linda Blair's house,seduces her  family and friends with magic and it's up to poor Linda to fix it.

The performances were good ,good enough that i found myself yelling stuff like ""she stole her bf and you think that it's ok that they still live in the same room, mom???"" at the tv.

It could've been better if the witchcraft savvy professor had been given more screen time.

He was a fairly interesting and underutilized character.

Dumbest thing about the movie was all the witchcraft themed stuff.

Wicca aren't evil and they aren't like vampires who can't be seen in photographs.

This movie is worth renting but not buying.",1127347200,6,696,4.512
1825817,4,B0000844ID,"Entertaining telechiller from Wes Craven starring Linda Blair. Blair plays Rachel, whose cousin Julia (Lee Purcell) comes to live with her and her family at the farm, but macabre events begin to happen and Rachel soon suspects that Julia is practicing witchcraft and voodoo. I wasn't expecting much out of this thriller but in my opinion, it worked very well and was surprisingly scary. Blair does a good job as Rachel and we are with her every step of the way, and Purcell is great as Julia. Wes Craven gives the film a slick, hard look and an impressive atmosphere (this was Craven's first 35mm film), and the script by Glenn M. Benest and Max Keller is riveting and suspenseful. Lois Duncan's acclaimed novel gets a nice little fright of a treatment with this little TV gem.",1088208000,9,777,4.678832116788321
1825818,4,B0000844ID,"When young Julia's (Lee Purcell) parents are killed in a car accident, she moves in with cousin Rachel (Linda Blair) and her family. At first, things are seemingly normal, but Rachel quickly comes to believe that the distant newcomer is a witch who's out to steal her boyfriend, her father, and her new party dress.
The story is based on Louis Duncan's (I Know What You Did Last Summer) well-regarded young adult novel. For Linda Blair, the role marks a transition between her prepubescent ""Exorcist"" character and the flashy roles she'd play a few years later. In the same way, for director Wes Craven, the film is a huge step away from his early exploitation attempts (Last House on the Left, The Hills have Eyes) and toward mainstream respectability (A Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream).
Produced for CBS television in the 70's, as A Stranger in the House, standards and practices at the time didn't allow any gore or extreme violence -- a pair of demonic eyes and a car crash or two is all you're gonna get, so don't expect any more than cheesy 70's PG-13 violence. But comparing Wes Craven's early efforts, Summer of Fear is actually his most accomplished film, at least technically. His first feature shot on 35mm, Fear looks slicker, is generally better acted, and comes from acclaimed source material, which it sticks pretty closely to.
That's not to say Summer of Fear is an undiscovered classic. The film is very campy, and offers plenty of unintentional laughs. Craven's direction is often rough and amateurish, but he shows some flair with background/foreground compositions and even throws in a few classic Craven-ian dream sequences to appease the Elm Street gang. I also like the fun supporting cast, including an appropriately bitchy Lee Purcell as the bad girl, a young Fran Drescher as Blair's best friend, and even Superman himself, Jeff East, complete with a bad perm.

This is a fun film to say the least, recommended for fans of the novel and those anxious to see Craven's Pre-Scream films. Don't expect anything special and you will have a good time. Thank you Artisan, for releasing this forgotten, but never lost, TV movie.",1087862400,10,2150,4.858310626702997
1825819,1,B0000844ID,"""Summer of Fear/Stranger In Our House"" finds chubby chickadee Linda Blair gettting a tough time from her much prettier cousin Julia, who to everyone's horror happens to be a connniving little witch!  What with Linda's pasty complexion making Prince Prospero appear a pinacle of good health, her pet horse having to be put down (cop the unfortunate stunt double in that scene!), Dad philandering with cousin Julia, best friend Caroline(Fran Drescher in an hilarious pre 'Nanny Fine'turn as a sexy hospital nurse with a knife-edged wit), a besotted brother who fails to score and a slimey boyfriend who dumps Rachel and gets it on with Julia, our poor beleaguered teenage heroine can't help but throw a few whiney tanties.  This is a terrible film, completely without suspense(by the time cousin Julia busts out of the dark room sporting her red, white and blue contact lenses and proceeds on a Starsky and Hutch smash-up for the last five minutes its too little too late).  Linda Blair has NO talent; this opus is proof perfect of her inability to act.  If in doubt check out  a few of her other cinematic craptasms- Airport 1975(so bad its great), Sarah T Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic, Roller Boogie, Savage Streets, Red Heat and most notorious of all Born Innocent. The toilet scene in that film says it all!",1077840000,5,1312,4.839285714285714

1825821,4,B0000844ID,"To be truely correct: Wes Craven's ""Summer of Fear"". Actually, ""Wes Craven Presents Lois Duncan's Summer of Fear"".
18 year old Rachel Bryant is getting used to the fact that her aunt and uncle have died in a car crash. But mostly, her cousin Julia who was at boarding school at the time. It's summer, and Rachel thinks she can deal with her cousin Julia. But there is something funny about Julia....
Rachel finds strange artifacts in her room that she is sharing with Julia such as a picture of herself with red splotches all over it. Wait a minute....Rachel suddenly suffered from hives a few days ago. And Rachel's horse has acted strangely around Julia until it suddenly had to be put down. And there is a strange figure with her horses hair on it....What is going on with Julia?!
I enjoyed ""Summer Of Fear"" since I first saw it on TV several years ago under the title ""Stranger in Our House"". It's creepy and some good plot twists help make this a winning horror flick for the ages.
