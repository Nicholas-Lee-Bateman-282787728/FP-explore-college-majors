Our main character, a soldier, is trying to return the body of his friend to his homeland.  What befalls him enroute is the meeting of characters which change the soldier's outlook and course.",1512172800,,309,4.385964912280702

8677989,4,B00NGAJHY6,"This movie is very slow and very deep.  It's not for passive watching.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that you won't know what it is about if you just watch it and expect the movie to give you answers.  The answers for the meaning of this movie must come from within you.  I think this movie is quite exquisite.  I'm still not sure what it was about but it sure has me thinking and I love that.

So the rest of this review will be a spoiler if you want to watch the movie.  Maybe the thing to do is watch it for yourself and then read the rest of this.  Here is my interpretation of what the movie is about.  I was thinking a lot about Joseph Campbell's understanding of mythology as I watched the movie.  One possible meaning of the movie is that the soldier died on the battlefield and his journey is actually going on in Purgatory.  He keeps talking about how tired he is yet he keeps going because he is committed to his duty.  He meets various characters along the way that give him information about choices he made because of his commitment to duty and to the idea of ""this is how it's done"".  He did not fight for the woman he loved and let her be burned as a witch (?) because he followed what was expected of him.  The old king tells he it is all about choice and that the results of choice is so simple.  Well, he chose his duty over his love and he is persecuted through eternity.  He chose his duty to get his friend back home no matter how tired and how hard the journey.  In the end, he has traveled very far and very, very long and is truly only dragging himself and his own choices behind him...a very long and boring/ordinary/not glamorous road and not very enlightened.  So he continues even after he has been given all the information he needs to rest.  In the Joseph Campbell teachings, he is a hero that has gone astray and has not actually accepted his hero's journey...instead he has chosen not to change nor to open his eyes to truth.",1470528000,,1961,4.1786666666666665
8677990,1,B00NGAJHY6,"As the reviewers above note, the description for this movie is totally wrong. It is a surreal story about a soldier who, after a terrible battle, is trying to return the body of his friend home. It appears, if I can make sense of the story at all, that his wife or lover was burned at the stake as a witch while he was away at war. A priest tells him to go back to the war, and trust the ""inquisition"" to sort out the accusation that she's a witch. Of course, they burn her at the stake. So after that, I guess he (and his friend) become mercenaries - and that is how they find themselves in the battle where his friend is killed. At the end of the movie, in the distance appears to be the ruins of a modern city (wrecked skyscrapers), and the sound of aircraft flying past overhead. His wife appears beside him. She says some cryptic stuff about time, and asks him do you know who I am? He says, yes and that he only want to go home. She responds by saying ""Do you deserve that?"" He looks at the body he's been dragging through the whole movie, and instead of his friend its himself. And the movie ends. I'm not sure if she is blaming him for leaving her to the fate of the inquisition, or if he's being punished for that, or what.

Maybe the title of the movie means something here. The ""Morning Star"" is apparently a biblical reference that can refer to both or either Lucifer and God.",1463011200,,1388,4.159851301115242

8677993,1,B00NGAJHY6,"A soldier (Adrian Bouchet) who is the only survivor in a battle vows to return a fallen man to his home. With the help of a witch (Ivy Corbin) the trip turns out to be a confused surreal nightmare.

There are scenes where our lead character talks to the dead man as in Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"" except it wasn't funny. There are dream sequences and battles along the way to an ending that didn't make much sense. It was as if I was watching a bad medieval purgatory version of ""The Road.""

In the end the sky has a jet stream in it and there is helicopter noise in the background as well as some other modern sounds and I have no idea if they were supposed to be there or not.  The film is about choice and free will. You might choose to watch something else.

8677994,1,B00NGAJHY6,"Describing/reviewing this movie ain't gonna be easy. It's certainly not what I expected. Not even close. I watched it twice this morning in an attempt to comprehend it better.

The product page description is inaccurate. It states, ""After conquering their enemies, a group of triumphant warriors return home to rejoice with their nation. What starts as a day of celebration, quickly turns to horror as the group discovers that the world they lived in has changed forever."" They did not conquer any enemies and were not triumphant. No one returns home. No one celebrates anything and no group discovers anything. In part, this story details the journey of one soldier who is attempting to return a slain comrade to the land of their fathers in order to bury him.

Although the soldier(none of the characters have names) frequently encounters ""others"" in his journey, he is traveling alone (well, with a corpse) and there are some extended periods of silence. I think the first dialogue was spoken at just under 15 minutes.

A good portion of the movie is a view of the soldier's perspective which is presented in a surreal, dreamlike fashion. He appears to be confused as to what is happening during his journey and with those he meets.

The makers of this film included witchcraft, Satanism as taught by many Xtians and Druidism(suggested in two places but can you find the second?).

This film is told in a certain way and as a result, I cannot tell readers much more or it would spoil the one and only interesting part of the movie.

Some may want to call this a ""B"" type movie but in my opinion, it's not. Cinematography, sound, costumes and locale seemed professional, appropriate and well chosen. I think they shot the entire movie through a gray filter.

The writing dialogue/storyline is confusing, flat, ambiguous and (thinking) ... just plain terrible.

I liked the main character so I wanted to find some sort of explanation that provided meaning and closure to this movie. I didn't find it the first time watching it nor did watching it a second time bring forth any great revelations.

No sex nor cursing. There is a very brief battle and a couple of sword fights but nothing major. Even so, this is not a movie for kids. They will not enjoy it at all. Most adults will not like it.

The film maker's attempt to provide a clever reference in the title of the movie but in their ignorance they totally missed the ""Mark.""

The ending does offer a basic, crude explanation. Actually, no one explained anything well, including me and I watched it twice.

The lead actor gets one star.",1417392000,9,2592,4.722838137472284
