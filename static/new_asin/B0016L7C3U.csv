Of course this earlier, silent version cuts things to the quick - it's about 80 minutes shorter than the Wyler film - but certainly either film would ""spoil"" the other for you, so it's not in matters of storyline that we should look for differences.

There is one significant addition in the earlier film, which perhaps seemed necessary in that more pious era: the first reel or so is taken up with the actual birth of Christ and the fleeing into exile of Joseph and Mary with him. It's fairly dramatic and nicely shot - they do a good job in this film with the heavenly lights - ""halo"" effects - but leaving aside the religious justification, there isn't really anything added to the film by it; the whole parallel between Jesus and Ben-Hur is if anything less developed here than in the later film, so it just seems like a superfluous nod to the most religious elements of the audience.

After that, things settle into the same pattern, though more quickly and in some cases, more brutally done. The galley sequence for example seems harsher and more ""realistic"" here, the battle on the ships more chaotic and senseless. The chariot race is pretty close to the equal of the '59 film and that's saying something; in fact it's a bit longer by a couple of minutes. Ben-Hur doesn't come by to witness Messala's death, either - this is a less forgiving rendition, I guess. The sets are just as spectacular - again, Jerusalem here is a huge and solid city with 50' walls, not the overgrown village of mud huts that we see in more recent renditions of the Biblical dramas that are typically making a greater attempt at ""accuracy"" (at least in the physical sense).

Overall I think the film has a couple of problems, the first being Raymond Novarro's rather bloodless portrayal of the title role; Frances X. Bushman so far outstrips him in charisma and believability as the antagonist Messala that I was rooting for him in the chariot race. Heston definitely makes the better Prince of Hur. The other issue I have is that the man, Ben-Hur, seems more a type and less a real person here than in the later film. The '59 film may be overextended a bit, but it allows the man to develop into a true heroic figure; here he seems a pre-ordained secondary Biblical character. Still, it's well worth seeing for the spectacular sets and action sequences, Bushman's powerful villainous portrayal, and some beautiful uses of 2-strip technicolor in a few sequences, most notably the well scene.",1255305600,2,2769,4.58989898989899
8263018,4,B0016L7C3U,"After seeing the famous 1959 version of this film a number of times in the last 45 years, it was interesting to contrast this 1925 silent version to it. However, let me say right off the bat that I enjoyed both versions, and I am not going to get into the ""which movie is better?"" argument.

May I also re-direct you over to the four-disc special-edition DVD which has both films available for one price and both look terrific.

This silent-film version was more true to the book than the more-famous 1959 movie, mainly from the Christian angle. Just look at the main title and notice ""A Tale Of The Christ"" was dropped for the '59 film even though that is the official title and the name of Lew Wallace's book. In this film, the life of Christ is much more prominent, and that's the major difference.

Both films feature a cast of thousands, the great sea battle and the dramatic chariot race. We have the intense and bitter rivalry between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala, capped off by the chariot race. To compare action scenes would be unfair since cameras and technical knowledge improve with time. Both versions wowed audiences in their day. The chariot race in the '59 version is still considered by some the great action scene ever filmed, especially since it was done without special effects.

Unlike the '59 movie, this silent version had TWO big stars in the leads: Ramon Narvarro and Francis X. Bushman, playing Ben-Hur and Messala, respectively. It also has an interesting mix of (mostly) black-and-white and tinted scenes. All the scenes involving Jesus had color. As in the '59 version, you never saw Christ's face.

Both had touching scenes with Ben-Hur and his sister and his mother. Speaking of women, a shocker in this silent version was a quick parade of topless women.

At 2 hours and 25 minutes this Ben-Hur was shorter than the '59 version. However, this is a long, long movie for a silent film and many people today probably wouldn't put up with no dialog for that long, but if you appreciate great film-making - from any era - this is a ""must"" for your collection.

Remember: since this DVD is ""unavailable,"" check out the four-disc DVD of Ben-Hur and you can enjoy this version as well as the one `59 one.",1232668800,7,2226,4.634517766497462
8263019,5,B0016L7C3U,"The story line is significantly different from the Heston later version. If anything, the ships fighting is better than in later version. 2d unit work is by B Reeve ""Breezy"" Eason, who did the wonderful forest ambush sequence in Flynn's Robin Hood. Bushman's portrayal of Massala is 1 of truly great male performances in movies. There are some 2 strip technicolor sequences that are wonderful. A theatre buff's delight in all ways. If you liked the Heston version you owe it to yourself to watch this also.",1210291200,9,506,4.827586206896552
