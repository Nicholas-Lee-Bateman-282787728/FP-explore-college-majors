8699375,4,B00SUTCELQ,"What a wonderful documentary, to think that the magazines of the 1960's and 70's were, in large part, responsible for the gay world to come out of the closet. Toby ross does a great job in showing us the path that were taken by men to at least see the things that we were striving to connect with. Was this pornography? As the very narrow minded government officials were trying to make it be. Was it art? as so many gay men wanted it to be. Was it dirty? As the vast majority of the American people wanted it to be. I think these pictures and magazines were the impetus to spur a minority to make the movies to become recognized and human beings who love and wish to be loved. God bless all these guys, photographers, editors and models alike.",1435190400,10,744,4.283687943262412
8699376,5,B00SUTCELQ,"Toby Ross has created an excellent documentary film detailing the history of physique magazines and movies.  His primary focus in this film is the period from 1969 to 1973.
Popular models such as Bill Eld and Ray Fuller are discussed, as well as the primary studios of the day: Athletic Model Guild, Champion, and others.
Toby also dares to discuss the ""chicken hawks,"" a subject so many are afraid to deal with.  But he deals with the subject factually and helps put it all in perspective.
We are shown how the focus went from the erotic to the blatantly sexual, and ended what is now referred to as the golden age of physique photography.",1431993600,7,640,4.605263157894737
8699377,5,B00SUTCELQ,"Toby Ross describes PAPER DREAMS in the opening credits as
A loving look back at turn-ons that changed our lives. It is that and so much more. Its the story how dirty pictures in magazines evolved into gay self-identity and pride.

This is a remarkable documentary that is unlike anything Ive ever seen before. PAPER DREAMS chronicles male pornography from the 1960s loincloth era through the 1970s and just before HIV/AIDS epidentic.  The scholarship is impeccable, sort of like a doctoral dissertation.  This is a PBS worthy history film that borrows as much from Ken Burns as Gus Van Sant.  Toby Ross is a true curator and historian.

PAPER DREAMS is also technical success. The video and audio quality is far, far superior to the typical gay porn film.  The soundtrack is luscious and warm.  The editing is flawless; the narrator is a good storyteller with an impish impulse.  The archival footage makes this film a must see.  Years from now it will be shown college classes and libraries. PAPER DREAMS is perhaps the finest gay porn documentary ever made.

My favorite chapter in the film is Hopes and Dreams, the early 1970s go-go years when young men from around the world tripped-out to San Francisco and LA.  They came for the vibes, the mind expansion and to fulfill their sexual desires.  These young men caused a sensation in magazine and movie sales because they looked like the guy next door.  Maybe they were the guy next door.  It was possible.

PAPER DREAMS felt like pages from my own life.  I was that sweaty, nervous teen boy buying a gay porn magazine at a seedy dirty book store. Like Toby Ross, these magazines told me of a world somewhere and inspired him to go there.  Toby Ross captures that freedom in PAPER DREAMS.

The film centers on Ross own story. He began his gay porn career in 1973 as a photographer and magazine publisher.  My favorite scene is one where Ross appears on camera as a TV reporter in the mod 1970s. The film is a screen test for a new male model. Ross uses it to talk about the mind of a photographer.

Another of my favorite scenes, early in the film, shows with the beefcake era.  A simple loop from the period of one hunky model is combined with the song Alley Oop by The Hollywood Argyles.  (Kim Fowley would have been proud of Ross use of it.)  Toby Ross is a master at setting a time and place with music.  For example, an instrumental version of Everybodys Talking from the 1969 movie Midnight Cowboy behind images from exact same moment.

Absolutely the films greatest achievement is that it humanizes the models.  Ross talks about the young men he filmed and photographed  who they were as people. He says their names and shares their backstories. We get to know the real person as we crave him.  PAPER DREAMS is about hopes, dreams, and dignity.",1431648000,13,2805,4.600806451612903
