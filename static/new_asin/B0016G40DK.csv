8262234,4,B0016G40DK,"Thanks to the WWE Network, I was able to relive a classic event in the second Clash Of The Champions which was titled ""Miami Mayhem.""  Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable with limited commercial interruptions (no interruptions during the matches) which in this case was to setup the upcoming Great American Bash PPV a month later.  It should also be noted that along with the matches during this event was a big angle were Ric Flair & Lex Luger signed the contract for the World Heavyweight Championship at that upcoming with Flair giving Luger the warning that would play itself out later in the night, ""you have to make it to Baltimore.""

NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Brad Armstrong - Both men started out trading momentum early such as armdrags & different types of takedowns while having counters & reversals to each other's offense while as Brad continued to work over Barry with a grounded side headlock & use his athletic offense such as a dropkick or high crossbody causing Windham to not only use his size & power advantage but also use whatever illegal advantage he could get weather it was using the ringside environment or J.J. Dillion on the outside in what was a evenly matched contest.

NWA United States Tag Team Champions The Fantastics vs. The Sheepherders - Fantastics started out showcasing their athleticism with various dropkicks only for Sheepherders to respond with brawling tactics along with using Rip Morgan on the outside to their advantage as both teams traded momentum as Fantastics kept up a fast pace while Sheepherders continued to use whatever tactics possible to slow the pace down & keep their opponents grounded including using whatever objects they could get their hands on in what was a competitive tag team match.

Jimmy Garvin & Ronnie Garvin vs. Varsity Club - Steve Williams was on commentary for this match while Kevin Sullivan was locked in a cage at ringside with Precious having the key to the cage to prevent any interference from him as this started out as a four way brawl with the match settling down as Steiner & Rotunda kept using their amateur wrestling skills to single out one member of the team heavily working over a body part along with taking shortcuts behind the referee as the Garvins attempted to use the same strategy against them only for Sullivan on the outside to keep drawing Precious to him distracting Jimmy as they traded momentum throughout the contest with the bigger story being what happened to Sullivan & Precious during & after the match along with how it effected her.

Nikita Koloff vs. Al Perez - Both men went back & forth early with Perez being able to take the advantage due to a mistiming by Nikita with Gary Hart getting involved on the outside before Nikita was able to make a comeback when more of a numbers advantage worked against him in a pretty basic average match.

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upperhand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.

This wasn't as high of quality as the previous Clash event but still a good event with quality wrestling matches that I would definitely check out.",1416355200,,3829,4.721556886227545
