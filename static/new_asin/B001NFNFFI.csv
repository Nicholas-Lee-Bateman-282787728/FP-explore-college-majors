  Usually with a comedic collective there's always a few comics that are mediocre,

The greatest compliment I can pay this video is that it has prompted me to see several of the comics featured. I recently saw Kathleen Madigan (hilarious, if you get the chance) and will be seeing John Caparulo sometime next month.",1295740800,3,405,4.561643835616438
