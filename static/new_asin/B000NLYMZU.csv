You have a cardio sculpt that is VERY effective and a Yoga segment.  I would consider doing both if you are advanced.  I alternate each with another cardio and it works well.  I have all of the Yoga Booty Ballet exercises and am very happy with them.  I did another beachbody exercise and got burnt out by it so I bought all of the YBB series and did it for about 3 weeks and now incorporate YBB with my TJ.  I lost more weight with TJ, but with YBB I developed a longer leaner body, especially in the booty and back of the legs, and most of all it helped me to LOVE myself!  It is an ""all-around"" program and the meditation's ground you and help you to become a better you.  If you have not tried YBB, get the starter set and you will fall in love with them.  Best of all, though-NO SHOES REQUIRED! (Except when you are lifting weights)  My feet have slimmed and strengthened.  It is just you, gravity, concentration, and FUN!  Try it!",1224028800,2,1088,4.218446601941747
