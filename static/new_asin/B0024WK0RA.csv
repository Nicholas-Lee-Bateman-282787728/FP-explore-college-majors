8350890,5,B0024WK0RA,"FROM THE OPENING SHOT OF THE MOVIE YOU AS THE VIEWER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET INTO. THE FIRST SHOT IS OF A WOMAN BEING SLAUGHTERED WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE IN THE BATH TUB. THERE YOU WATCH THE MAIN CHARACTER NAMED HOLDEN STAB HER OVER AND OVER. I KNEW THEN THAT THIS PICTURE WAS GOING TO BE A TRIP INSIDE THE MIND OF A KILLER AND THAT I WAS GOING THE HAVE THE BEAUTY OF AN INDIE HORROR FLICK THAT I LOVE SO MUCH.

FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO STATE I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. I GREW UP ON HORROR AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY MAIN SUBJECT OF CINEMA VIEWING SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BABY CRYING AND PISSING MYSELF MAINLY DUE TO WATCHING HORROR MOVIES THAT WHERE MY BABYSITTER, TALK ABOUT A SCREWED UP CHILDHOOD.

THE STORYLINE OF THIS PICTURE IS SIMPLE. A COLLEGE STUDENT NAMED HOLDEN WHO IS VERY INTO HIS MAJOR AND HIS FUTURE IN SCHOOL SPOTS A YOUNG FEMALE STUDENT NAMED SADIE AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON HIS CRUSH, HIS STALKER WAYS OF INSANITY STARTS TO RUIN AND CONTROL HIS LIFE. WITH THAT SAID I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YES THE STORYLINE SOUNDS BASIC AND SIMPLE BUT THIS INDIE HORROR MOVIE HAS SO MUCH MORE THAT THE VIEWER CAN REALLY SEE IN DETAIL AND PICK UP ON THROUGH THE ACTING OF CHRIS BURCHETTE AND THE DIRECTION OF TRAVIS MILLER. TRAVIS' TALENT FOR DIRECTION AND THE BEAUTY OF FILMING A THOUGHT PROVOKING HORROR MOVIE, SHOWS HIS TALENT WAITING TO BURST OUT. HE HAS AN EYE FOR THE LENS THAT CAPTURES THE INSANITY AND THE BRUTAL NATURE OF WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I WANT TO APPLAUD CHRIS BURCHETTE WHO PLAYS THE MAIN KILLER HOLDEN, HIS ACTING SHOWS PURE HATE, A PURE ANIMALISTIC RAGE AND MOST OF ALL A SHY BOY NEXT DOOR ATTITUDE ALL WRAPPED UP INTO ONE.

HOLDEN NARRATES THE PICTURE FROM THE FIRST SHOT TO THE LAST. THIS IS ANOTHER STANDOUT PART FOR THIS PICTURE AND THAT IS THE AWESOME WRITTEN NARRATED WORDS FOR THIS MOVIE. I REALLY ENJOYED LISTENING TO THE KILLERS WORDS BECAUSE IT CAPTURES IN AWAY A POETIC INSANITY THROUGHOUT WHICH MAKES THE MOVIE FLOW WITH EASE. YOU SLOWLY WATCH AS HOLDEN STARES WITH A BOYHOOD CRUSH OR MORE LIKELY A TED BUNDY LUST UPON SADIE WHO HE WATCHES WITH GREAT DETAIL. HOLDEN IS SHY AND THE BOY THAT MORE OR LESS IS THE ONE STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD. AS HE TRIES TO MAKE HIS MOVE HE SEEMS TO FAIL IN MANY WAYS.

BESIDES THE OVER ALL KILLINGS AND THE INNER DEMONS OF HOLDEN THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE POWERFUL FOCUS OF THE MOVIE IS THE VOICE OVER NARRATION AND THE SLOW PACE OF THAT INNER MADNESS THAT SHOWS ON SCREEN AS HOLDEN STALKS SADIE, TAKES PICTURES OF SADIE, FOLLOWS SADIE HOME AND STARES THROUGH HER WINDOWS. TRAVIS MILLER HAS TAKEN THE MADNESS IN GREAT DETAIL AND FILMED IT FROM THE START OF THE KILLER UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT OF THE KILLER. THIS MOVIE WORKS BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE NATURE OF IT AND YET THE OVERALL BUILD UP OF HOLDEN'S CHARACTER AS AN INSANE OBSESSED MANIAC THIS PERFORMANCE WORKS IN SO MANY WAYS.

YOU WATCH FROM THE KILLERS IDEAS AND VIEWPOINTS WHICH MAKES THE PICTURE ALL MORE REALITY BASED INSTEAD OF THE KILLER HIDING IN THE SHADOWS OR NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE MONSTER, TRAVIS MILLER HAS PLACED THE MADMAN RIGHT IN FRONT WITH THE IDEA OF SUCH CLASSICS LIKE HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER AND AMERICAN PSYCHO AND BOTH OF THOSE MOVIES CAN BE SEEN AS AN INFLUENCE IN THIS FILM.

NOW TO BE AN HONEST REVIEWER WITH THIS REVIEW I NEED TO PICK OUT SOME NEGATIVE MOMENTS WHICH MOST ALL LOW BUDGET INDIE MOVIES HAVE ANYWAYS, SO IT'S NOT LIKE I AM SPEAKING BAD OF THIS FILM BECAUSE I REALLY REALLY REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE. THE DOWN FALLS TO THIS FILM IS THE BASIC THINGS YOU WOULD SEE FROM AN INDIE LOW BUDGET FILM SUCH AS PACING AT SPOTS OR A MOMENT IS TO LONG SUCH AS THE ENDING. I FELT THAT THE ENDING WOULD NOT END, TO ME IT WAS A LITTLE DRAWN OUT WHERE HOLDEN KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE VICTIMS AND THE OUTSIDE. IT JUST WAS PACED WRONG BUT REALLY I OVER LOOKED IT BECAUSE THE BASIS OF THE FILM, SHOWING THE SADISTIC TORTURE, WORKED IN MANY WAYS AND THESE CAPTURED MOMENTS, WHERE HOLDEN IS PLAYING WITH SADIE AND SADIE'S BOYFRIEND STANDS OUT TO BE REMEMBERED. IT FELT REAL, JUST A LITTLE TO LONG. CERTAIN EFFECTS WITH MAKEUP SUCH AS A PLASTIC LEG AND THE FINAL MOMENT OF HOLDEN WAS A LITTLE CHEESY BUT IT'S NOTHING MAJOR BECAUSE IT IS AN INDIE MOVIE.

I COULD NOT HOWEVER OVER LOOK SOME OF THE REALLY BAD ACTING. CHRIS WAS AMAZING AND I COULD SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH ANYTHING HE DID, FOR THIS TO BE HIS INTRODUCTION TO THE FILM WORLD, ITS A POWERFUL STATEMENT ON HIS ACTING PART. CAMERON WRIGHT WHO PLAYS SADIE WAS VERY TALENTED IN THE ROLE SHE SEEMED REAL AND GAVE A GOOD PERFORMANCE. HOLDEN'S FRIEND'S, AND MAINLY ROLAND ON THE OTHER HAND I FELT LIKE PULLING MY TEETH OUT, EVERY SHOT WITH THIS YOUNG MAN TALKING WAS HORRIBLE. THE MOMENTS WITH ERIC AND ROLAND'S CHARACTERS I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT, NOT THE DEATH MOMENTS BECAUSE THEY WORK. THE MOMENTS WHEN ROLAND AND HOLDEN ARE TALKING ON THE STEPS AND IN THE LIBRARY AND SO ON WAS JUST WAY OVER DONE. NOW ROLAND'S DEATH WITH THE PILLOW CASE ON THE HEAD AND RUNNING THROUGH THE PARK IS AMAZING, ITS A GREAT FILMED MOMENT FOR AN INDIE PICTURE.

WHEN HOLDEN IS TALKING TO HIS FRIEND WHO IS DYING NEXT TO HIM IT HAS A TWISTED REALITY THAT WORKS FOR A HORROR MOVIE AS HOLDEN EXPLAINS HOW THEY USE TO FISH TOGETHER AND HOW AS KIDS THEY PLAYED TOGETHER, IT'S A MOMENT THAT STANDS OUT TO THE VIEWER.

THE BEST PART OF THIS MOVIE IS WHO IS BEHIND THE SCREEN BECAUSE I CAN TELL BY WATCHING THIS THAT THERE IS SOME GREAT TALENT THERE. THE DIRECTION OF THE FILM WORKS IN MANY WAYS AND I CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE TRAVIS' NEXT MOVIE AND I HOPE MANY FUTURE PROJECTS THAT HE WORKS ON. THE WAY THE CHARACTER OF HOLDEN IS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED PLACES THE VIEWER INSIDE THIS HOLLOW, INSANE MAN, THAT PUSHES THE LIMITS OF LIVING EVERYDAY LIFE AND YET HOLDING A DEEP DARK PASSION OF ANGER, HATE AND SADISM THAT CONTROLS HIS NIGHTMARES AND DREAMS. TO ME IT'S A BONUS TO WATCH THE MAIN KILLER GROW IN A MOVIE AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN BLOODSTAINED ROMANCE.

HOLDEN IS CAPTURED AS THE SHY KID WHO INSTEAD OF APPROACHING PEOPLE HIDES BEHIND HIS OBSESSION. WHEN HE SEE'S SADIE FOR THE FIRST TIME HE IS LOCKED IN HIS FANTASY. YOU WATCH AS HOLDEN TRIES TO START A CONVERSATION AND BEFRIEND SADIE AND TRY TO ASK HER OUT BUT FAILS AND THEN TURNS THAT LUST OF HER INTO A TWISTED IDEA OF LOVE AND DARK FANTASIES THAT CONTROL HIM TO THE POINT HE BOILS OVER AND ATTACKS EVERYONE AROUND SADIE AND EVERYONE THAT GETS IN HIS WAY.

HOLDEN IS CAPTURED IN GREAT DETAIL AS YOU SEE THE PARANOIA, DESIRE, UNCONTROLLABLE LUST SLOWLY CHANGE THE YOUNG MAN FROM COLLEGE STUDENT WITH A FUTURE TO PSYCHO KILLER WITH THE TASTE OF BLOOD AS ROMANCE. I FELL IN LOVE WITH TWO POWERFUL MOMENTS IN THIS FILM. THE SHOT WHERE HOLDEN IS WEARING SOME BLACK SKI GOGGLES AND EATING CHIPS WHILE WATCHING TORTURE PORN ONLINE, LOOKING AT PICTURES OF GIRLS IN PAIN AND SUFFERING TIED UP AND BEING TORMENTED, THIS MOMENT IS FILMED AND ACTED PERFECT, I FELT THE SENSE OF EVIL AND THE SENSE OF A TWISTED DESIRE OF PAIN AND LOVE IN THIS MOMENT, THAT IS HOW WELL CERTAIN MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE ARE FILMED AND YOU CAN SEE THE TALENT THAT IS THERE. THE OTHER SHOT IS THE TORTURE OF SADIE'S BOYFRIEND IN THE GARAGE, IT FEELS REAL AND THE MOMENT WHERE HE PAUSES AND DECIDES TO TURN ON SOME HEAVY METAL MUSIC IS PRICELESS AND REMINDS ME OF THE MOMENT WHEN MYERS IN HALLOWEEN TURNS HIS HEAD BACK AND FORTH AS HE JUST STABBED HIS VICTIM IN THE HALL.

THIS MOVIE DOES HAVE IT'S FLAWS BUT MOST INDIE HORROR MOVIES DO, BUT IT ALSO HAS WHAT HORROR FANS WANT. I CAN TELL THAT TRAVIS TOOK HIS LOVE OF HORROR MOVIES AND WANTED TO MAKE A PICTURE FOR THE FANS OF HORROR MOVIES. I SEE SUCH AMAZING POTENTIAL IN THE WORK OF TRAVIS MILLER. I CAN SEE A GREAT FUTURE IN HORROR IF THAT IS THE GENRE HE IS GOING INTO. IF THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE HAD A BIGGER BUDGET, THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE WORKED IN MANY OTHER WAYS, I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A PUT DOWN BECAUSE THE MOVIE BEING AN INDIE IT WORKS, WHAT I MEAN BY BIGGER BUDGET IS THE MOVIE COULD HAVE EXPANDED WITH BETTER MAKEUP AND CERTAIN BETTER ACTORS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE CHRIS BURCHETTE IN MANY MORE FILMS, HIS TALENT IS GREAT.

TRAVIS MILLER MADE A GREAT INDIE FLICK AND IT SHOWCASES HIS TALENT.

MY RATING:
10 OUT OF 10
