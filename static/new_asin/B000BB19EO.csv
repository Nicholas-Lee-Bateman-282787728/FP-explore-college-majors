8084231,5,B000BB19EO,"I just have to say this is exactly what I was looking for- quick, easy and effective. I needed something that was not too time consuming- mostly for stretching- and this woman is very easy to follow and very pleasant. I love this dvd!",1339977600,,234,4.340909090909091
8084232,4,B000BB19EO,This video is exactly what I was expecting and will serve my purpose in the morning.  I will use it daily to follow Dr. Oz's suggest of 7-10 minutes of yoga in the morning.,1329091200,,172,4.0588235294117645
8084233,4,B000BB19EO,"As previous reviewers have stated, this video was clearly NOT made by a professional studio - the audio is bad and the camera is static.  However, I have used about 10 yoga videos over the last two years and find myself coming back to this one over and over.

I would not recommend this to someone just starting out - Ms. Pillipuf does breathe through her mouth and makes a few other minor yoga ""mistakes.""  But if you're looking for something to help you between yoga classes, this is a nice fit.

There are several poses and variations that I have not found in any other classes or videos.  I also find Ms. Pillipuf's enthusiasm and big smile very engaging.  And when I'm crunched for time, the 10 or 15 minute options make a definite impact on how my body feels the rest of the day, without the larger time commitment.  I particularly like that she takes time for savasana even on the short workouts.

If you need your workout videos highly polished or letter-perfect, this is not the video for you.  If you're looking for something cheerful and a little different that can fill a gap between sessions, I would recommend it.",1262822400,,1127,4.512315270935961
8084234,3,B000BB19EO,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. This is really a pretty good dvd. It includes 4 short uniquely different yoga routines. Sometimes I don't have time for a full hour or more of yoga. Many yoga dvd's I've seen with different lengths of practice are just the same footage, but cut and spiced to give you a variety of practice times. On this DVD each of the four are separately filmed routines. They include the following:

Stretch and Relax (my favorite!), 10 minutes. You start with standing, breathing, and side stretching, and then you move on to the floor for hip openers. Very nice, complete routine in only 10 minutes!!! She holds the postures for a good amount of time (not a fast moving routine). You really feel the stretching. Also includes a very short Savasana at the end.

Total Body Express, 15 minutes. Again you start with standing postures, move to the floor, and then end in Savasana.

Engery, 20 minutes. Sun Salutation and warrior postures.

Abs and Back, 25 minutes. More (new) standing and floor postures. Some nice variety on classic postures!

I would agree with the previous reviewer that the sound quality is not very good (that is why I gave it a 3 rather than a 4 rating). There is an echo, but the background music is quite nice.

I like the pace of the practice since she holds the postures for a good amount of time. This is not a fast pace ""power yoga"" practice, but still quite challenging. The filming is in someone's living room in front of a large stone fireplace and Evamarie leads the instruction live (no voice overs). It may have been a bit more interesting if there were students participating in the class, but Evamarie is a very pleasant, thorough instructor. I would disagree with the previous reviewer on the ""Better Sex through Yoga"" dvd...this one is much better in content, but very similar in quality!

8084235,1,B000BB19EO,"I have been practicing Yoga for about 2 years, and I am very passionate about it - No I am not an expert. But I have about 50 DVDs in all. And even with the worst ones, I have always been able to learn something of great value, a new asana, a tp to get the asana just right, a pointer, help, an inspiring word that I can take with me in my other practices. I always refer to other customers reviews at Amazon for their words of wisdom regarding Yoga DVDs, and there have been near misses, but all in all I feel the reviews have been of great value to me in deciding what Yoga DVDs to purchase. I have never written a review because I felt that everything good and bad about the particular Yoga DVD had already been addressed and I had nothing of value to add.  But when I watched this particular DVD - I was so outraged I felt I had to post a clear warning to all on how awful it really is...
That being said...

Yoga Express...
Where do I begin... Just plain awful Everything about it. I kid you not.
I purchased it because of it sounded great, 4 dif. workouts, quickies. I read a few good reviews by other who consider themselves in the ""YOGA know""

The quality is just plain awful, much like the DVD series ""Better Sex Through Yoga"" (but that Yoga DVD series actually has a good Yoga workout within decent Yoga parameters - although the quality stinks).
What I hated:
1. Terrible echo, poor audio, poor visuals.
2. She exhales through her mouth! There's no mouth breathing in yoga!!! Simple first rule!
3. She trying her darndest to keep the down dog peacefull, then she cocks up her head and starts talking non-stop!?! And this is throughout the entire practice...

I am sure she is a wonderfull fitness instructor. But as far as yoga goes - what a BUST. I know I threw my money away on this one.",1144972800,5,1800,4.239067055393586
8084236,5,B000BB19EO,"The two things I liked the most about this DVD, besides the obvious that it's a great time saver (my work and lifestyle pretty much ensure I will never have a full hour to do a yoga workout), are a) that the time durations vary, which makes it even more flexible to my schedule, and b) the instructor's choice of postures, which flowed nicely and yet challenged me enough to feel my muscles reap the full benefit of strengthening and stretching.  I also appreciate the ability to pick and choose from the different themed workouts, it's great because I can just leave the DVD in my player and switch off from day to day.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1136678400,8,660,4.491666666666666
