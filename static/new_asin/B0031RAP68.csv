8387241,5,B0031RAP68,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer--the picture quality, sound quality, etc.--not for how good the story or acting is, or not. ""Presumed Innocent"" has a beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's very sharp. And this is a 1990 film. The audio is excellent as well. I'm very pleased with this purchase, which is an upgrade to the DVD I already owned.

(By the way, in contrast, the ""Presumed Innocent"" DVD really stinks on my HD TV, it's of the worst DVDs I've seen on my 55"" HD TV (it's VERY soft-focus there); most other DVDs look better on an HD TV than does this DVD.  But, THIS BLU-RAY looks fantastic-- a MAJOR upgrade to the DVD.)

There are no extras with this blu-ray, but, yes, it does have a menu!

By the way, another reviewer wrote that he had bought this blu-ray double-feature, and that the ""Frantic"" film had French audio on this American version, which was corrected to English on a later edition.  He also furnished the bar code numbers of the old and new products.  Neither matched mine, and mine has the correct American (English) audio.  The bar code on mine is 8 83929 10637 0.  The ISBN # on mine is 1-4198-9295-9.

GREAT job on this film's transfer via excellent Blu Ray remastering. One of the best blu-rays, technically, for a 1990 film.

""Frantic,"" while appearing slightly less sharp than ""Presumed Innocent,"" is really an excellent blu-ray transfer, too.  Its colors are accurate and vivid, too.  It's just that the picture looks a hair soft; still excellent, but with a soft layer of grain and thus not as crystal-clear as ""Presumed Innocent.""  Possibly this is in the film's master . . .  Still quite enjoyable to view, and the best picture we've seen for this film.  Also recommended!",1378512000,2,1785,4.65814696485623
8387242,1,B0031RAP68,"Unfortunately Amazon has just combined the reviews for the old and new Blu-Rays of FRANTIC, confusing things even more.

This first pressing of Polanski's brilliant thriller has defective audio - it does not contain the English language theatrical audio track, which was 100% in English.

It is sold here as ""Presumed Innocent / Frantic (Thriller Double Feature)"", with a release date of February 23, 2010. Look instead for the new version, released in 2011 and sold on a separate page here at Amazon.

Flaw of the old disc:

The audio track marked as ""English"" is actually the French theatrical track, which is about 80% English and 20% dubbed French. (It originally played there largely with subtitles)

This mistake was then replicated throughout the world, so until May 2011 there were no correct Blu-rays of FRANTIC available

From the moment this disc came out in 2010, I made requests for a corrected disc to Warner Home Video. There was never a helpful response.

Finally, I gave up and contacted Roman Polanski's office in Paris early this year.

They were polite and most helpful. Mr. Polanski himself contacted Warner Bros and they finally fixed the disc.

The corrected disc is now available here at Amazon. It is currently listed as ""Frantic & Presumed Innocent"", with a release date of May 31, 2011.

I'm hoping Warners will do the decent thing and offer an exchange program for everyone who has defective discs and wants a new one. As soon as I have info on that, I'll post it here.

A more detailed description of the audio error follows:

All the dialogue between English-speaking characters is still in English, but most of the exchanges that Ford and Buckley have with French characters are now in UNSUBTITLED FRENCH, dubbed by Ford and Buckley themselves. It's jarring, since it's a huge plot point that Ford's character can't speak a word of French.

In addition the French characters all speak to each other in dubbed French now. This despite the fact that their mouths are clearly moving to the English words, since that's the language the entire film was shot in. Their exchanges are only subtitled with the useless ""SPEAKING FRENCH"" for every line.

The previous VHS and DVD releases both contained the original audio, only this Blu-Ray is incorrectly mastered.

A casual viewer may not notice this audio error, they may just be a bit confused by the randomly appearing French dialogue. But anybody who knows the film well, as I do having seen it far too many times, will not be a happy camper. It should also be pointed out that key plot information is delivered in some of the now unsubtitled French exchanges, which might make the film a tad confusing to a first-time viewer.",1273104000,69,2703,4.83297180043384
8387243,4,B0031RAP68,"If you're a fan of the oft overlooked FRANTIC, it's FINALLY in Widescreen.  A comparison between this Blu-Ray version and the previous cheapie DVD is no contest.

Update:  I finally saw PRESUMED INNOCENT after having watched FRANTIC twice on this BluRay.  PI is okay, but sort of standard mystery whodunnit.  Not a dud, but kinda lifeless beside the more interesting FRANTIC.",1268956800,10,375,5.081967213114754
8387244,3,B0031RAP68,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray release of these films in one combo package, not a review of the films themselves, which one would assume are so well known that any Harrison Ford fan interested in them would know all about the stories and so forth already.

Both these films were very long in the tooth in their DVD releases, looking very dated on DVD with low res look transfers and mediocre sound.

The good news: both films have never looked better or sounded better than they do here.

The bad news: both films appear to be using be the same telecine transfers used for the prior DVDs, just cleaned up and given a vastly better presentation using the much higher bandwidth and better video codecs available for Blu-Ray.

Telecine quality and film to digital technology have come a long way in recent years, and both films retain a very DVD-ish 90s look that has more to do with the dated transfer than with the style of the films. Black crush abounds, especially in ""Frantic"", and detail is average at best. That said, the prior DVD editions of both films were so entirely awful that this has to count as a serious upgrade for both titles, even as it fails to exhibit the qualities one would hope for in more recently made transfers of catalog films.

It's not clear if the telecine sources employed were originally in 2k resolution or not. They may have been less than that, if they were in fact originally minted in the early days of DVD, now re-purposed for Blu-Ray.

The sound has been ""upgraded"" to DTS-MA, but only DTS-MA STEREO. So, you are getting, as with the video, a very upgraded and cleaner presentation of the same dated original soundtrack mix used for the older DVDs. All in all this is a good presentation of these two catalog films on a combo Blu-Ray disc, but only on mark down at $10 or less. Not worth more than that though.",1266969600,67,1849,4.488095238095238
