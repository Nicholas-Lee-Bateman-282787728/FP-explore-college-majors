8182218,4,B000NWC1QG,"""Handguns and Home Survival"" is a very comprehensive guide to learning the proper strategies for home defense, staring with handgun safety and moving through in-home tactics. This definitely has a late '80s or early '90s feel, but the information is still just as relevant today.

The video features ""dramatizations"" of home intruder situations that are an effective reminder of why training is important if you are going to own a gun for protection. The subjects covered include:

* Selecting an appropriate handgun
* Safety and rules, including the eight basic shooting fundamentals
* Correct stances for home and defense firing
* Tactical movement and techniques
* Night vision (not the electronic type)
* Moving family members
* Confrontation with an intruder and avoiding family hostage situations
* What to expect when the police arrive (VERY important!)

This is available on DVD as well, but it is a direct transfer and the video quality suffers.

Recommended!
