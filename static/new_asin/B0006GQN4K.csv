8303095,4,B0006GQN4K,Please be aware that the cover on this DVD says it is the Betty White Show and even describes the show on the back side as being the Betty White Show where Betty plays an actress working with her ex-husband.  The actual DVD is only of Life With Elizabeth which is an entirely different show.  It is still good but it is NOT the Betty White Show where she plays an actress instead of a housewife.  I have seen the true Betty White Show and it is wonderful but cannot find it on DVD.,1353369600,,481,4.095744680851064
8303096,4,B0006GQN4K,"I would've given this disc five stars but the quality could be improved. A great selection of episodes and you get to see Betty bust her husbands balls circa the forties, it's something you have to see, go buy it! Then buy Golden Girls and Lake Placid, for Betty's funniest dialog ever!",1142812800,,286,4.519230769230769
8303097,4,B0006GQN4K,"Betty White Show 1 includes 4 episodes of Life with Elizabeth tv-show from the fifties. Sweet Betty White and Del Moore are on the main roles. How muh tv has changed since those days! So innocent, so sweet, the golden years of tv.",1141862400,,230,4.372093023255814
