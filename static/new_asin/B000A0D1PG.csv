8071085,5,B000A0D1PG,"A brilliant notion to interview some of America's songwriters before they shuffled off their mortal coils.  Filmed in the start of the 1980s, this is a great record of the guys who brought wit and literacy to the craft of song-writing, something extinct in the music of today.
My personal highlights are the Alan Jay Lerner and Yip Harburg segments, which demonstrate the hard graft and sensitivity of talented song-writing.
A glorious dvd set!

It would be fun to know when and where these programs originally aired.  If there are more of these shows out there I hope they are brought to DVD...again, what a great collection of DVDs...anyone who loves musicals will surely enjoy these!",1198627200,4,497,4.811764705882353
