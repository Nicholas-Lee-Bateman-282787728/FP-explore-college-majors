448313,5,6302287448,"Clark Gable and Doris Day had such chemistry in this movie they are always annoying each other. Jim Gannon (Clark Gable), and Erica Stone (Doris Day) are 2 rival Newspaper business people! This movie turns into a great classic comedy and the 2 learn to love each other I highly suggest this movie to anybody !",1083110400,3,309,4.535714285714286
448314,5,6302287448,"Filmed in black-and-white at the height of the Technicolor era, this film is an intentional throwback to the old-school screwball comedies, with a plot based on mistaken identity and a love/hate relationship between a blustering man and a too-professional gal.  Clark Gable was a bit long in the tooth when this flick was made, but he does quite nicely in his role as Jim Gannon, a gruff, hardbitten newspaperman who has an axe to grind against smartypants college classes that purport to teach students how to become journalists.  He stomps off to Fancypants U., to give them all a piece of his mind, but when the egghead professor turns out to be a stylishly attired Doris Day -- well, hubba hubba! -- he starts to change his mind!  Next to ""Run Silent, Run Deep,"" which came out the same year, his is one of Gable's finest later performances, and Day is as lovable as ever.  Top honors may go to the supporting actor, Gig Young, who delivers a wonderfully understated, funny performance as one of Day's fellow academics.  His sly slapstick in a long hangover scene is worth the price of admission all by itself.  A nice film, very much of its time... The ""serious"" theme -- about the importance of a good college education -- takes over the film in the second half, and actually brings it to a grinding halt right towards the end... But the movie is still entirely enjoyable, and worth checking out if you're looking for something light and retro.",1082160000,2,1450,4.666666666666667
448315,5,6302287448,"Tough, cynical Jim Gannon, a newspaperman from the ""old school"" first ridicules then falls for a lady teacher who has her own ideas about writing the news. This little 1958 film is a jewel because it contains one of Gable's finer latter-day comedy performances.  As the veteran newsman, Gable literally had me laughing out loud in a couple of scenes - something I didn't expect at this point in his career.  As Erica Stone, the beautiful teacher of journalism, Day really shines in her plumb role, conveying sexiness, brains and taste in her performance.  Gig Young all but steals the show (he was nominated for a best supporting AA) in his gem of a performance as the likeable egghead Hugo Pine; his playing is smooth and assured.  Young  eventually WON an Oscar for his brilliant performance as the cynical MC in THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY?  Tragically, Young fought private demons in his private life and would ultimately commit suicide - taking his newlywed young wife with him. Mamie Van Doren does okay in her role as the sexpot singer who flirts with Gable in the nightclub scene; there's a fair performance from Nick Adams as the apprentice newsboy to whom Clark offers fatherly advice.",1023494400,23,1196,4.809756097560975
448316,5,6302287448,"At first glimpse, Clark Gable and Doris Day may seem an unlikely match.  More than twenty years separated them in age and their on-screen images might seem, to a casual filmgoer, totally at odds. That ""Teacher's Pet"" works so well is a credit not only to the expertise and polish of the stars but also to George Seaton's smooth direction, a smart and funny script by Fay and Michael Kanin, and a great supporting cast headed by Gig Young and Mamie VanDoren.
""Teacher's Pet"" was a very popular release in the winter/spring months of 1958.  Day's hit recording of the title tune also helped. It was Gable's most successful outing in some time and possibly the best film of the last three or four years of his career.
Gable plays a gruff lifetime newspaperman who honed his craft in the school of hard knocks. He has little tolerance for anyone who didn't learn the way that he did.
Doris Day is a journalism professor, highly successful at what she does and into her class comes Gable, under the guise of a wannabe reporter. Their byplay and interactions are extremely well written and played with great skill and ability by both stars.
Naturally they fall in love but the course of love does not run smoothly. Some interesting twists and complications are thrown into the mix that make the story surprise the viewer and keeps the plot moving swiftly and entertainingly.
Clark Gable does his usual ""Gable-esque"" bit but somehow there is a poignance in some of his scenes that adds new dimensions to what we've seen scores of times previously.  Doris Day plays a professional career woman as few other actresses could do during that time, managing to be funny, determined without losing her feminine qualities, and proving more than a match for Gable. She also manages to exude far more sex appeal that VanDoren, who is funny in a supporting role.  Day's ""aping"" of VanDoren in one scene is a highpoint of the film.
Gig Young was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for this film.  It's the second of four on-screen appearances opposite Day and they have a great chemistry together.
While the film may be something of a time capsule of another time and place, it's a time capsule worth opening. ""Teacher's Pet"" will have you grinning frequently, laughing out loud quite a few times, and wishing that today's stars had the matchless charm of those of yesteryear. A star vehicle but this is one class you'd be glad to sign up for.",1009497600,2,2437,4.684579439252336
448317,5,6302287448,"Here is another Clark Gable romantic comedy classic, made in the 1950s. Gable's talent is not lost with age. Gable is the experienced newspaper City Desk Editor, lacking in formal education but a master of the newspaper business & reporting. Doris Day is the journalism professor who feels education is key to a successful paper. The 2 ideologies clash between them, with Gable playing a student in day's class to impress her romantically.
 Exceptional acting and dialogue from both, with an exceptional support role from Gig Young. Even Doris Day shines with her wit and dialogue in the apartment scene with Gable when she mimicks Gable's current girlfriend, Mamie Van Doren!

448877,4,6302287448,"Sometimes we find ourselves less in love with the person in front of us than in love with the ghost of a memory of the person that our lover reminds us of.  That is the story of the 2005 Korean film ""Teacher's Pet"" (""Sarangni"" or ""Close To You"").

Cho In-young (Jeong-eun Kim,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marrying-the-Mafia/dp/B0009PLMGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marrying the Mafia</a>) is a thirty year old Math teacher who finds herself in a dilemma.  She is undeniably attracted to her seventeen year old student, Lee Seok (Lee Tae-seong), mainly because he reminds her of her own ""first love"" from her youth, coincidently also named Lee Seok.  Cho In-young seems to have an unconventional and cavalier attitude towards sex and love, as she casually jokes about starting an affair with the young Lee Seok with her live-in boyfriend.  Complicating matters, however, is a young high school girl who shares the name Cho In-Young, who is also pursuing Lee Seok, but only because he is the twin brother of her boyfriend who has died.  So Lee Seok finds himself by two women named Cho In-Young, one his teacher, one his co-student, yet both of whom love him not for himself but for the person he reminds them of.

What starts as harmless flirtation on the elder Cho In-young's part soon becomes serious as Lee Seok returns his teacher's affections, and she is put in the dilemma of carrying through with her seduction or abandoning the whole thing as a foolish last-ditch grasp for youth.  Cho In-Young's live-in boyfriend, perhaps sensing that the game is going too far, locates and brings back the original Lee Seok into Cho In-Young's life, hoping to break the spell that her distant first love still holds over her.  The original Lee Seok is now older, and barely remembers Cho In-young's name, but is interested in renewing the past connection.  The situation comes to a head at a dinner party at Cho In-young's house, where all three men are gathered, none aware of the nature of her relationships with the others.

Those expecting some sort of salacious student/teacher love affair will be disappointed by ""Teacher's Pet.""  There is no nudity in ""Teacher's Pet,"" and not even a single sex scene.  About as titillating as the film gets is a slow pan of a pile of mixed clothing next to a bed letting us know what is going on without actually showing any of the details, and some rather frank talk about circumcised vs uncircumcised equipment, and which is better.

Surprisingly, the taboo nature of that relationship is barely touched upon, other than in a heart-to-heart with Cho In-young and one of her friends who both talk about finding joy in relationships that are socially looked-down upon.  The story is much more of a ""chit lit"" tale of an woman on the cusp of thirty, seeing her youth trailing behind her and caught between three lovers each of whom has something different to offer.  This provides for some good comedy, such as when Cho In-young visits a fortune teller who advises her to ditch her boyfriend and Cho In-young replies ""which one?,"" to which the fortune teller is struck with envy.

With so many characters running around with the same names, the story of ""Teacher's Pet"" can get confusing.  At first I thought the scenes of the younger Lee Seok and Cho In-young were flashbacks to the elder Cho In-young's high school days, but a confrontation between the two Cho In-youngs over Lee Seok showed that they were both very real.",1266969600,3,3504,4.930272108843537

Running a bit too long at 120 minutes, it's actually an intriguing look at the shifting journalism ethos of the late 1950's when hardcore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Front-Page/dp/B000YQT7QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Front Page</a>-style newspapermen were begrudgingly making way for reporters with college degrees. It should come as no surprise that Clark Gable represents the former as Jim Gannon, the no-nonsense editor of the fictitious New York Evening Chronicle, at odds with journalism teacher Erica Kane played with sophisticated lan by Doris Day, who was just embarking on her most fruitful period as an actress with her near-classic pairings with Rock Hudson soon to follow.

Written by Fay and Michael Kanin, the plot has the self-made Gannon bristling at the thought of lecturing at Kane's night school journalism class. When his boss forces him, Gannon reconsiders when he sees that Kane is a pretty blonde but is soon forced to take on the identity of wallpaper salesman Jim Gallagher when she humiliates him by reading out loud to her class the nasty letter he wrote her. The ruse continues as Gannon decides to prove that journalism classes are a sham and that nothing replaces the first-hand experience of working in a newsroom. Things get complicated when he becomes her star pupil and sees his competition for Kane's affections, the dapper Dr. Hugo Pine, a self-effacing overachiever who happens to be a much-published psychologist, an expert mambo dancer, a polyglot, and a smooth bongo player. You can pretty much figure out the rest.

As Gannon/Gallagher, the 57-year-old Gable was near the end of his career, and he looks tired and paunchy here. Fortunately, he provides enough of his recognizable swagger and snap to get away with the hard-boiled aspects of the role. At this point in her career, Day had already moved securely away from the lightweight musical comedies that were her forte and into leading lady parts with surprising aplomb. Underneath the manicured schoolteacher veneer, she brings a wholesome yet mature sexiness to Kane that makes the age gap between her and Gable less of an issue than one would expect. Playing his standard role of third wheel, Gig Young does an agile turn as the too-good-to-be-true Dr. Pine. Nick Adams (who would attempt to seduce Day the following year as a carefree college boy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pillow-Talk/dp/B0001CNRC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pillow Talk</a>) has a small part as Barney, the copy boy desperate to become a reporter, while Marilyn Monroe-wannabe Mamie Van Doren has a memorable bit as Gannon's showgirl squeeze.

449033,5,6302287448,"1958's ""Teacher's Pet"", starring Doris Day and Clark Gable, is well worth an evening's viewing. It's billed as being a comedy, but there are many good serious/dramatic moments in this picture as well.

Don't get me wrong ... the comedy is certainly there too. Doris' nearly falling flat on her face after her initial kiss from Clark will have you reaching for the rewind button a couple of times! Doris' ""weak knees"" scene after Clark leaves the room is a fall-down-funny moment to be sure.

""Teacher's Pet"", which debuted in movie theaters on April 1, 1958, co-stars Gig Young, Nick Adams, Mamie Van Doren, and Jack Albertson. Young was nominated for an Academy Award, in fact, for his part as Doris' suitor, ""Dr. Hugo Pine"".

It's definitely a good supporting cast, but the film without question belongs to Doris and Clark. Doris Day is completely believable as journalism Professor ""Erica Stone""; with Mr. Gable matching her scene for scene as hardened and crusty newspaper editor ""Jim Gannon"", who simply MUST be softened up by Doris (and eventually is, too).

Doris gives a very realistic portrayal of ""Miss Stone"", as she perfectly balances her profession (that of journalism teacher) with her eventual personal feelings for the overbearing new ""student"" (Mr. Gable) who recently signed up for her class.

In addition to the realism that comes across in Miss Day's performance here, there are also several authentic-looking scenes that take place at Clark Gable's place of employment -- ""The New York Evening Chronicle"" -- where Gable/(Gannon) is responsible for publishing one of the city's newspapers every day. The ""City Room"" scenes are very impressive, in my opinion, providing a gritty look of realism that further enhances this film's believability.

An example of the ""grittiness"" of Mr. Gannon's newspaper City Room lies, literally, on his oft-used telephone (the dust and dirt that rest on it to be precise). Gannon's phone hasn't been cleaned in years by the looks of it. He's too darn busy putting out the daily ""Chronicle"" to worry about such trifling cleaning jobs. This type of ""dusty"" detail shows through all the more via this polished-up DVD version of the movie. Very nice attention to detail, indeed, by ""Teacher's Pet"" Director George Seaton.

A small subplot in the film provides a part for Vivian Nathan (as ""Mrs. Kovac""). It's just a minor role for Nathan, but one that stands out, especially her final scene with Clark, which helps to soften Gable's character a bit more.

It's easy to see from this movie why Doris Kappelhoff (aka: Doris Day) was one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1950s. The 33-year-old Doris is positively radiant in this film. And she looks all the better thanks to this splendid-looking DVD edition of ""Teacher's Pet"", which presents this black-and-white movie clear as a bell, and as it should be seen -- in its original Widescreen (1.85:1 anamorphic) format.

The audio gets a good grade too, coming through loud and clear on the disc's Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack (English only). English Subtitles are available as well.

There are no special bonus features on this disc. No trailers. No commentaries. Just the movie itself. But that's okay by me, because the film looks so darn good here (as does Doris, too, of course). ;)

The back side of the DVD case offers up a rather clever way of communicating the content of this disc -- presenting the information in the form of a newspaper.

There isn't a Chapter Guide paper insert included with this Paramount disc, but there are a generous amount of Chapter Stops included on the DVD -- 26 of them -- nicely spaced throughout the movie, a film which clocks in with a running time of just a few seconds shy of two hours exactly. There are nine separate ""Scene Selection"" Sub-Menus with which the viewer can navigate the individual movie chapters. The Scenes/Chapters are laid out three to a screen, across a background meant to represent a school blackboard. (And keep an eye on the ""moving eraser"", which changes positions as you hop from screen to screen within the ""Scene"" Menu. A nifty little added Menu touch.)

FYI -- The tail-end of ""Chapter 13"" on this disc is worthy of further mention -- that's the hilarious scene when Clark plants an unexpected ""first kiss"" upon the lips of Miss Day. I could watch it over and over again. Absolutely classic, including Clark's dryly-uttered line just after the smooch -- ""So long, Professor"". ... (I can't help it, it just breaks me up every time I play this.) ~LOL!~

449035,5,6302287448,"""Teacher's Pet"" is a deliciously funny look at journalism, and the clash between 'formal' education vs. practical experience, with higher learning championed by Doris Day, and the 'School of Hard Knocks' represented by the 'King', himself, Clark Gable. Despite an obvious age difference (Gable, at 57, was showing all of his years), the chemistry between the stars is electric, and with Oscar-nominated Gig Young providing terrific comic support as Gable's brilliant yet down-to-earth competition for Day, the film manages to be both witty and wise.

With over a quarter century of playing newspapermen, the role of hard-boiled City Editor Jim Gannon fit Clark Gable like an old shoe. No-nonsense, pragmatic, and a workaholic, Gannon was the classic 'school drop-out' who learned the newspaper business from the ground up, and held college in contempt. While Gannon was obviously a dinosaur, even by 1950s' standards, Gable appears to be having a ball as the cigarette-smoking, plain-spoken, 'blue-collar' hero.

Despite the constant ""Will she or Won't she?"" sexual undercurrent of so many of her best comedies of the fifties and early sixties, Doris Day was also a feminist during the era, with her characters self-sufficient, and often holding down important positions based on merit. As Erica Stone, an ex-reporter who returns to college to teach journalism, her demeanor is professional and her knowledge unimpeachable, making her the perfect foil for Gannon.

While the descriptions of Gannon and Stone sound like formula characters for Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn (not surprisingly, as the script was penned by longtime friends Fay and Michael Kanin), the Gable/Day teaming provides a sexual tension that, by the late 1950s, would have been far less apparent had Tracy and Hepburn taken the roles. Even at the twilight of his career, Gable was so totally 'male' that he raised the bar of any actress opposite him, with Day's signature 'perkiness' transformed, here, into sexual potential in a tight skirt (watch her tease Gable, swaying her hips to ""The Girl Who Invented Rock and Roll""; Day has never been sexier!)

While the resolution is not surprising, some remarkably candid observations of what makes good print journalism are given by both Day and Gable, with Day's comment of television replacing newspapers as the public's source for breaking news remarkably farsighted in 1958!

If you want a terrific comedy with two stars at the top of their game, look no further; ""Teacher's Pet"" delivers!",1114128000,65,2516,5.2643391521197005
449036,5,6302287448,"Hard-as-nails, uneducated city news editor Jim Gannon (Clark Gable) sits in on a journalism class by teacher Erica Stone (Doris Day) and falls for her. Trouble is, he's posing as Jim Gallagher---a new student, because he had crassly rejected her offer to speak to her class on, what else, journalism. He has a hard nose against education since he never finished high school and believes that experience is the best teacher. She is amazed at his skill and offers to tutor him, unaware of his ruse. Complications arise from a colleague of Stone's, Hugo Pine (Gig Young) who's a world class scholar on everything. Mamie van Doren is in an all too brief role as Peggy DeVore, Gannon's girlfriend who sings at the Bongo Club and performs ""The Girl Who Invented Rock & Roll"". She's very funny and holds her own with Gable in the equally funny night club scene. This b&w 1958 film (scripted by Fay & Michael Kanin) has much to say on honesty and truth in journalism but also scores points on experience as well. The chemistry between Gable and Day is near perfect. Young is quietly brilliant as Hugo as well as a deft comedian and gives a very impressive interpretation of a hangover. Good supporting cast features Nick Adams as Gannon's young gofer and protege and Marion (""Happy Days"") Ross as Day's savvy secretary. The DVD print is widescreen and fairly good. But what sells this film is Gable. He's supposed to be gruff and tough but his sensitivity as an actor layers his character with all the right humor, charisma and charm. He may have been aging, but he was still one of the best actors ever to cross the screen. Enjoy.",1113955200,19,1623,4.638888888888889
449037,4,6302287448,"I've been eagerly awaiting this DVD release for some years now, and it's finally here! The pushing-60 Clark Gable--and if a more appealing man has ever lived, I'd really be interested to learn his identity--is entirely convincing as 30-something night-school adjunct Doris Day's love interest in this tale of on-the-job training vs. academia. Bringing up the rear (and earning a Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination for his efforts) are Gig Young as the egghead who's got it all...except Day, and Mamie Van Doren--hilarious in a small part as ""The Girl Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll."" Forces join seamlessly to provide truly witty, tasteful comedy (they not only DON'T make them like this anymore, I don't think they CAN) as worlds collide with delightful results.

The print isn't bad; it's anamorphic and I'm going to assume the the aspect ratio is correct (although we're given no specifics as to what it is). There's some shimmer but not enough to be truly distracting; the sound is fine. Unfortunately, there are no end credits, and since it seems to me that it has always been Paramount's habit to use them, I have to conclude that they exist and that the home video division was too lazy to bother including them on the disk, which is housed in a nice, locking keep case. There are NO extras, not even an insert with a chapter index, and the only subtitles are English--no captioning for the hearing-impaired (ironically, given the film's subject, whoever transcribed the subtitles was unaware of the gerund ""their"" and mistakenly used ""there"" in a scene near the end; a sad indication that even today's formally educated know zip about the proper use of their own language). It's this bare-bones quality that has cost a star, and it should be mentioned that this IS, after all, a budget release. HOWEVER, Fox titles are also very inexpensive, and they're PACKED with extras. So no excuses, Paramount. How about a little respect for the King of Hollywood?

Incidentally, Gable--a high-school dropout, not unlike the Jim Gannon character--was a self-educated man who was a voracious reader. It's often the case that, when discussing a film (either verbally or in print), the reviewer states something to the effect that one scene or another ""is alone worth the price of admission/the cost of the disk,"" etc. There are any number of such scenes in Teacher's Pet, but if I were FORCED to choose one about which to make such a claim, it would be the one in which Gannon, in a fit of ""tough love,"" fires his adoring young dropout protege to force him to go back to high school. He utters the phrase about spending one-third of his life going to, staying in, and coming out of men's rooms (to avoid displaying his ignorance of topics with which he's unfamiliar) with such voice-breaking conviction, that it's a safe bet Gable is drawing from personal experience. On this basis, one can assume that neither actor nor character would be caught dead using the ludicrous malapropisms that run rife through the writings of those whose education consists of watching movies and television; these include ""run in the mail,"" ""takes the price,"" and (my personal favorite) ""from my point of you."" Sigh.

Gig Young, incidentally, ended badly: I still remember the shock I experienced years ago upon learning that he'd committed suicide after murdering his (much younger) wife. And apropos of my previous assertion of Gable's appeal--which is universal--let me share a personal anecdote.
Some years back, a very young friend (mid-20's at the time) came to visit. She's Hispanic, and is about as refined, restrained, and undemonstrative a lady as one is likely to encounter. My television was tuned to TCM; Mutiny on the Bounty was being aired. My attention was on my friend, who suddenly emitted an alarming gasp that lasted a full five seconds. Her hands had involuntarily seized her chest and she croaked a strangled ""Oh, my GOD."" Her eyes had strayed to my set at a moment when the entire screen was filled with a closeup of the young Gable's face. She then gasped, ""WHO is THAT?!""
I rest my case.",1112745600,7,4092,4.859598853868195

Her son, Bernard (Nick Adams) is just the errand boy there.  She wants her son to be fired so he can go back to school for an education.  Gable thinks differently.  The kid has a good head start.  Even helps him with a story or two and has him on as an extra.  Clark gable by order of his boss, must go to see Professor Stone of the Journalism class.  He didn't count on the Professor being Doris Day.  He was invited to appear at this class as a guest speaker, but wrote a rude letter back.  Now his boss is making him go to apoligize.  Well, there he is in the classroom to apoligize, (Actress Marion Ross [Happy Days tv series] is the first student through the door) but doesn't because the Professor believes he will not show up.  She got the rude letter and reads it to the class.  Now that Gable had a face full, he sneaks out of the classroom, but now he is in an angry rut.  here he is the City Editor and never went to high school.  He believes the Professor is teaching amateurs to be amateurs.  So he goes back to the classroom incognito as a student to teach this lady professor a thing or two about the newspaper business.

In this, Doris, the daughter of a late Pulitzer prize winning newspaperman, is a night school instructor of journalism who invites Gable, a hard-core newspaper editor who came up through the ranks without an education and looks down on eggheads, to speak to her class.  His boss makes him go, and he does--incognito--doing everything possible to disrupt the class until he ""shows promise"" as a journalism student.  Having gotten a gander at Doris, he tries to make a move on her, but he is still incognito!
