Children of all ages can sing along with these animated classics that the whole family will enjoy! The toys come to life in ""The Tin Soldier!"" This poignant tale of a steadfast, one-legged grenadier has inspired children since it first appeared in print in 1838, and remains a beloved parable of duty and sacrifice. It even inspired the smash hit ""Toy Story!"" ""Rumpelstiltskin"" is perhaps the most famous dwarf in all of folklore! This tale of the mysterious little man who could spin straw into gold has fascinated children for nearly two centuries, and remains a popular bed-time story around the holidays and year 'round!.",1211932800,,771,5.078740157480315

The animation is haunting and his personality is amazing. I love the songs. I'm sorry, but this DVD release is going to be a MUST-BUY for me. THANK YOU FHE!!!",1188172800,2,384,4.12
