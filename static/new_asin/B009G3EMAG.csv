5324735,5,B009G3EMAG,Was going to show it to a group of friends but we didn't get a chance.  From reading about it it sounds very cute.,1389225600,,114,3.75
5324736,1,B009G3EMAG,"Poorly written, condescending, and unfit for human consumption. However, it is appropriate for actual dogs since they will have no idea how degrading the movie is to their species.",1387670400,,180,5.241379310344827
5324737,5,B009G3EMAG,"A fun kid's movie or family watching.  Cute.  I'm 71 and enjoyed watching it.  Not an exciting, fast paced movie that I enjoy much more but still an all around cute movie.  The actors did good work as well.  Apparently there was one that came before this one which I haven't seen.  It's sort of a ""Home Alone"" flavor, only with dogs.",1363737600,,333,4.290322580645161
5324738,5,B009G3EMAG,I a cute christmas movie that would entertain the kids. Its a movie you want to see over and over again,1362009600,,103,3.9523809523809526
5324739,5,B009G3EMAG,"I Love, Love Love this movie.  It is Family Friendly and very enjoyable. I watched it over and over again while babysitting my 5 year old neices.  They loved it too.  I have to take movies to entertain them, and this one is a winner.  I am going to try and find the other movies that are connected to this one.  This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time!!!  If you are looking for good clean fun family entertainment, this movie is for you.",1360195200,2,453,4.149425287356322
5324740,3,B009G3EMAG,great for kids and dog lovers but thin in the plot and mostly dog thoughts. Wife liked it cause she loves labs.,1357344000,,111,4.090909090909091
5324741,4,B009G3EMAG,"This is a franchise in case you are not aware. The first movie is called The Dog Who Saved Christmas and the second is called The Dog Who Saved Christmas vacation. The first two movies are about a former shamed K-9 dog named Zeus who is adopted by the Bannister family to be their guard dog. Usual hijinks ensue with getting a new dog (destruction, toilet drinking, the common faire) but Zeus saves the day by thwarting two burglars and saving Christmas. The second movie is more of the same except the Bannister family goes skiing in the mountains but the same burglars show up and try to ruin Christmas a second time, only to have another happy ending. Think of this as Home Alone but with a yellow lab.

This movie has the Bannister family going to Malibu, California to see George's (the father) sister for Christmas. She lives in an enormous house and supposedly has an invaluable Christmas star coveted by a nefarious mobster. Yes, the same burglars show up again in this movie. They borrowed money from the nefarious mobster and now he wants their thumbs since they cannot pay him. The irony of this is that the burglars borrowed money to open a dog grooming business and neither of them likes dogs. The mobster tells the burglars to get this Christmas star by 1:00 am Christmas morning and all is forgiven.

Meanwhile, George's sister Barbara (Shelly Long) gives the family a new puppy for Christmas, who they name Eve. Eve is a trouble maker, as most puppies are and Zeus winds up taking the rap for all of her misdeeds. In the end the two put aside their rivalry and save Christmas again. The movie is quite predictable but the dogs are charming and you like the Bannister family because they are very real people. I do recommend you watching all three movies because the character development in the first one is important to make you sympathetic to the Bannisters, but I think one would like them anyway. Dean Cain plays the ""head"" burglar Ted (a far cry from his Superman days but he is still good) and several other character actors are in this movie. Zeus is voiced by Joey Lawrence (though in the first he is voiced by Mario Lopez).

Overall, this is a fun family movie to be appreciated by dog lovers everywhere.",1354924800,,2229,4.5675

8541070,5,B009G3EMAG,"Another great movie in the series.  The acting is really good and at times, I felt sorry for Zeus since he was blamed for things he wasn't doing.",1483401600,,145,4.178571428571429
8541071,5,B009G3EMAG,"Family friendly and cute dogs.  Predictable story and acting but kids like it.  The animals don't move their mouths... but they ""talk"".  It is a low budget type movie but still cute.  There are a whole series of this ""dog saves"" movies.",1465603200,,236,4.5476190476190474
8541072,4,B009G3EMAG,Fun movie. Light hearted fare...just what is needed for the holidays.,1455408000,,69,5.363636363636363

8541075,3,B009G3EMAG,"It's okay...I LOVED ""The Dog who saved Christmas"" and ""The Dog who saved Halloween"" but this one...my main problem with this one is how much of a JERK George was towards Zeus. Really out of character. Plus the kids got on my nerves in this movie. It's supposed to be a comedy but it's really kinda depressing with the family ignoring poor Zeus.

I mean when its a plot about a new puppy it's supposed to be funny but this was just SAD. Not a fave of mine...",1422403200,,457,4.193181818181818
8541076,3,B009G3EMAG,"This was the third in the Zeus series and most of the adult cast returned.  New kids again!  They keep getting younger.  This tale was the worst of the three.  Sillier, stupider, cheesier and really geared only for young children who like talking animal flicks.  This one is simply for the little guys.  Performances suffer a lot in this tale of the Bannisters heading to Malibu for Christmas and getting a new puppy.  The puppy makes Zeus's life miserable.",1416960000,,457,4.708860759493671
8541077,3,B009G3EMAG,"We get these for the kids. It bored me to tears. And is it just me, or is the whole ""Someone Saves Christmas"" theme getting really really old? But I know, somebody somewhere, right now, is scheming to make yet another Save Christmas movie for next year. Help!",1390608000,,259,4.416666666666667
