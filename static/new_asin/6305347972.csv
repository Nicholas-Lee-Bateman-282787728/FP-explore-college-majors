8324071,5,6305347972,"This video is one of a series of about 8 programs that originally ran on PBS.  Hosted by the wickedly clever (and funny) Penn and Teller, each segment focuses on a different medium (sculpture, photography) or concept  (color, balance).  The Hockney one focuses, I believe, on perspective.  Each program is a serious look at art, delivered at a level that is  meaningful (and fun) to kids, while still being interesting to adults.  We  have been watching them since the kids were 4 and 7, and three years later  we are all still happy to watch them again and again.",942710400,18,564,4.626262626262626
