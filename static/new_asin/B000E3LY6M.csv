They are still funny for me although, if made in today's world, would be unlikely to find much favor because they would be considered politically incorrect and unsophisticated even though they required an excellent sense of timing and an acting style all of it's own.",1209340800,3,384,5.0

8105506,5,B000E3LY6M,Arrived on time and in excellant condition.  Charlie Chaplin was a genius.  I don't know that his vision will ever be seen again.  Any film student out there should surely study his work and accomplishments.,1366416000,,207,4.857142857142857
8105507,1,B000E3LY6M,"Horrible quality - really awful. You can see nothing.  Shadows and Fog. And occasionally Chaplin's moustache floating around like an angry ghost.  Some of the films are in are in French.  I have no problem with that.  I like that language. Plus - these are silent films.  Clearly copies of copies of copies of public domain films.  The company icon - in color - appears occasionally during the films to discourage you from copying.  I think the inability to see any of the action in these films would be enough discouragement.  Here's the kicker - three of the short films end abruptly - as in, they end before they are over.  You don't get to see the film you paid for.  Junk.  The music, however is OK.  Kinda liked it.
Take the disc and throw it at somebody you hate.",1326326400,40,770,4.421428571428572
8105508,3,B000E3LY6M,"A comment that was left following my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kid-2-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00017LVNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kid (2 Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;reminded readers what set I was reviewing, because Amazon has reviews for certain films showing up with unrelated editions. This eight DVD box set is an example of a collection that includes a poor quality edition of The Kid, and an uneven collection of other material. Many of the reviews appearing with this collection at the time I wrote this were for a completely different collection of 57 films, and with the rest of the reviews, I can't tell what collection they are reviewing.

With over 50 titles, it's hard to be an expert on which ones are presented in the best way in which set, but if you are looking to build a Chaplin collection, start off with his better known feature films. This particular collection includes only two films that were well known enough that the compilers chose to list them on the front cover. The rest of the set is like a diamond mine. You need to go though an awful lot of dirt before you find something valuable.",1320796800,4,1187,5.3138297872340425

8105510,1,B000E3LY6M,"When the selling point of a set of films is the box they come in, that's not a good sign. These prints are lousy, and often simply copied from official sources, meaning this is basically a pirated set. Speng the money to get the real thing - you won't be disappointed. (Kino company for the Keystone, Essanay, and Mutual Films, and the Chaplin Family Trust for the rest.)",1290988800,15,371,4.470588235294118
8105511,3,B000E3LY6M,"I found the previous reviews of this item lacking, to say the least, so hopefully this one will help any potential buyers out there.

If you're a collector, as I am, you will be pleased with the embossed tin that this 2-DVD set comes in.  It is made of good quality metal and will be a nice addition to your DVD collection.

Inside the tin are 2 DVDs in regular-size keep cases that are housed in a cardboard slip case that matches the design of the tin.

Disc one contains ""Shoulder Arms"" (45 mins), ""The Champion"" (20 mins) and ""The Kid"" (60 mins).  Video quality is actually very decent, although I'm sure no remastering was done.  As for the audio... well, it sounds like someone put an old vinyl album of ragtime piano on a turntable and let it play along as the videos were being transferred.  The music is not bad at all (Scott Joplin maybe?  I'm not sure.), but it is complete with the pops and scratches inherent to vinyl.  And if the music follows the action of the story at all it is pure coincidence.

Disc two contains ""Easy Street"" (11 mins), ""The Vagabond"" (19 mins), ""Work"" (24 mins), ""The Tramp"" (26 mins), ""The Knockout"" (25 mins) and ""Kid Auto Races at Venice"" (6 mins).  Video quality here is not as consistent as disc one.  ""Work"" is almost unwatchable, and ""The Knockout"" fares little better.  However, for what it's worth, the audio is much better.  It sounds like they used a CD instead of vinyl this time.  Again, the music does not follow the on-screen action, but it's not bad music.  I believe Chaplin himself composed the music for most of his features and it is a shame that that music is not included here, but considering the age of these films (1914-1921) there's probably a valid reason why it is not.

One other thing--there are no chapter divisions in this set, so you can't skip forward or backward very easily.

Overall, not a bad deal for the money IF you catch it at the sale price or used.  (For some reason it seems to be selling for really outrageous amounts lately!)  If you're a Chaplin collector you probably already own ""The Kid"" and ""Shoulder Arms""; but the remaining films, while not among his best, are certainly worth adding to your collection.

Happy viewing!",1285372800,43,2211,4.5188916876574305
