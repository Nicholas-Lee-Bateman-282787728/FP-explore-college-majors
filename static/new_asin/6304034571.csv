7859661,5,6304034571,"In fact, an excelent concert! The program is the Liszt's Funerailes and Chopin's Polonaises (6 of them). If you choose to zoom in the tape's photo you can see the program.
Maybe, Mr. Berman was not in his best performances... It's a 1992 concert, so he was finishing his brilliant carrier. But, this is not a problem, the tape is really good. I thought a very powerful performance.
The film, the prodution, including scenes and cameras are fantastic. I'm sure the public in the concert hadn't so good scenes as you can see in this video. Some parts, two cameras let you see the left and right hand at the same time. Mr. Berman play some of the bests polonaises, including the ""Heroic"". This last one, he play with no apparent difficulties, as he was playing something very easy. The Op. 44 it's very powerful too. If you like Berman, this is a good option. I've never seen this video in other stores, something rare.",1010534400,,916,4.557575757575758
