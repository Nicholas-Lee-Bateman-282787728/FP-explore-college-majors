2711012,3,B000LO094M,"Like other Danish ""coming of age"" films I've seen, this thing sort of trots all over the place without any real narrative, instead just being a series of events with no logical end.  This is great, so long as you know coming into it this is what you're sitting down for, and I was definitely interested in this movie throughout, although befuddled at times.  Despite a relatively sophisticated grasp of Danish culture there are still things as an outsider I'm not sure I ""get"" and the ending in this one is especially confounding.  The characters aren't especially depthful, and disappointingly the protagonists don't so much evolve as suddenly become very different things from what they are in the start of the film, leading to a few moments when I worried the film's lead might actually be some kind of deranged sociopath.  (Alas, he's not.)  Not a great film, but not a bad way to spend a Saturday night either, this is definitely not a ""story"" so much as just things happening erratically, as they would in life.",1276387200,5,1017,4.72316384180791
2711013,5,B000LO094M,"Product Description
A teenage boy's sexual confusion becomes a catalyst for dramatic change in this tendor and unpredictable first feature from Danish director Stefan Henszelman. Not since YOU ARE NOT ALONE has Denmark dealt as openly and honestly with, what for America, still remains a taboo subject, the open exploration of sexual identity. Several unexpected twists punctuate the young hero's coming-of-age odyssey, making FRIENDS FOREVER the hands-down audience favorite at every international film festival where it has been screened. Fresh, provocative and illuminating, FRIENDS FOREVER dares to go where commercial American cinema still fears to treat, and the result is a haunting and memorable film experience.",1212364800,6,720,5.80188679245283
2711014,3,B000LO094M,"This is a Danish movie with English subtitles. And it is mostly about teenage kids in the local school. The situations in this environment are very standard around the world with little differences. There is the bullies, the in-crowd or popular groups, outsiders, drugs or pot, alcohol, and unpopular teachers or administrators. The movie is set in the 80's with the flashy clothes and hair styles.

The movie is mostly about 3 kids, Henrick, a short lived character in the movie, who is a ""weird"" outsider, practices meditation and oriental philosophy. He is lured by the new kid Kristian, a homophobic straight kid. Henrick comes on strong to him, perhaps sexually, and Kristian like for him comes to an end. Henrick moves away to practice a model job. Afterwards, Kristian seeks the popular cute boy, Patrick. He lives a double life, being gay, and fooling everybody. This friendship flourishes.

There is self-discovery by both boys. There are sexual encounters with the local girls and an older woman by Kristian. Meantime, Patrick becomes  involved with an older, athletic guy (Mads) after moving into his own place. Kristian becomes shocked and angry with Patrick when he discovered that his best friend wasn't what he thought he was, straight. Kristian humiliates Patrick in front of a class discussing the job market. He tells everybody that Patrick is gay, but by now Patrick was comfortable with his sexuality. Kristian becomes very upset when he realizes what he has done and turns his back on his buddy (there are scene flashes of all the special moments between them.) He shows up at Patrick's place and walks in while Patrick and Mads are making love. Kristian is babbling about some flier he made to protest the school administration. Kristian make sup with Patrick and accepts him as gay.

There is some kind of a strange musical piece at the end. The movie has its moments. But it is set in another culture with different customs and beliefs. Gay issues are pretty much standard.",1201824000,6,1997,4.916913946587537
2711015,4,B000LO094M,"'Friends Forever' (Danish, with English subtitles) is a 1980s coming-of-age film concerned with growing up and friendships. The principal character is Kristian (about 15 years old) who arrives at a new school and is initially drawn to an outsider, Henrik, who is - as always - taunted for his difference. Fearing that this friendship will be a liability, Kristian falls in with the 'in group', led by Patrick (14/15 years old), who quickly becomes his best friend. The film then follows the inevitable ups and downs of this friendship, applying the full gamut of coming-of-age experiences: first crush, homosexuality, alcohol, first sexual experience with an older woman, student rebellion, and so on.

While this probably sounds a tired theme, it is actually one of the better films of its genre. Absent the puritanical values that usually stem from mainstream US-made films, 'Friends Forever' has a relaxed, non-judgemental feel. In particular, it avoids gay/straight stereotypes, and certainly does not shy from male nudity (although the full frontal shots are the preserve of a couple of 20-something characters). The acting is well-done, and the characters come across as highly plausible; the soundtrack and production values are unmistakably mid-80s, which adds a additional ambiance. There is a great deal of humour in the film (not least the 1980s hairstyles and roll-up jacket sleeves / shiny short-shorts apparel ! - which, admittedly, only comes to us from our retrospective vantage point) and it ends with a hilarious French-farce-style song-and-dance number, involving the entire cast.

Whilst not emotionally challenging, or dark in any way, 'Friends Forever' is a thoroughly enjoyable, feel-good film which easily bears more than one viewing. It's great to see it finally brought to DVD, along with some of its peers (see, for example, 'Lakki'). Definitely one for the collection.",1193529600,30,1896,5.359060402684563
2711016,2,B000LO094M,"This was listed as an LGBT film, but although that isn't untrue exactly, it isn't the focus.  This is a story about a heterosexual teenager adapting to life in a new school.  The relationships he makes seem to take him down the wrong path, especially when he gives the brush-off to a schoolmate who is trying to be his friend who might be a more positive influence in his life.  Yet, as he gravitates towards an unruly group of friends, gets sucked into participating in bullying and harassing other students, nothing comes of these antics.  There are no repercussions, no lessons learned, no real arc to the boy's story.  Strangely, the whole experienced is wrapped up with a random musical number in crazy costumes.  Strange is the only word for it.",1468886400,,751,4.694656488549619

2711045,3,B000LO094M,"This Danish film is a bit different but a very enjoyable one nonetheless. Kristian is the ""new kid"" in his school and initially begins trying to form friendships with the other students. He is quickly drawn to a group of other boys who seem quite normal and might help him to fit in. There is also Henrik, also about Kristian's age who seems to be attracted to Kristian right from the beginning and it would also appear that the attraction is quite mutual. But Henrik is somewhat the outcast in the school, a good looking guy who is already developing a career as a model and is deeply engrossed in oriental self defence and meditation. The two share a brief friendship but when Kristian feels his friendship with Henrik is possibly going to make him an outcast as well, he quickly parts ways with Henrik to bond with the other guys in school and be more popular. This seems to end any same-sex attraction that may have begun stirring itself inside Kristian's mind and be goes on to explore sexuality as a straight boy. Although the films description leads us to believe otherwise, It appears that any gay desire for Kristian was but a brief passing moment.
Kristian begins to bond as friends with Patrick, a tough acting kid, independant and already moving out on his own to have his freedom. Half way through the movie you are left wondering just who is and who isn't gay in this film, as no one appears to be. But while Patrick acts as tough man on campus so to speak, he is hiding his true desires until he meets Mads, an older athletic guy that he falls in love with. Then it becomes obvious that perhaps Patrick's parents may have kicked him out for being gay. It's hard to say, but leaves the impression there was conflict in his home forcing him out on his own. Soon his bully exterior begins to soften and his feelings for Mads come out in the open without warning to anyone and Kristian is quite appauled. He doesn't understand but quickly relaizes he's the only one who has a problem with Patricks lifestyle. The two friends, along with Kristians girfriend, form a close friendship that will bond them for life in spite of their differences. Variety describes this film as: ""A film about daring to live with an open mind, a film about yearning and love"". That seems to describe the film best to me, and far better than the items description which is rather jumbled on the DVD case with several typo's and a few names listed wrong. Half of what I read in the description makes no sense at all in the film.
I like this film, it is different and from a culture I'm perhaps just not familiar enough with, and though a little dissappointed with the plot, it is a fun, entertaining film about youth and personal searching to find onesself. The acting is very good, the characters are portrayed very nicely by the cast who each seem to fit into their role perfectly from start to finish. Sound and picture quality are very good and the whole production is pretty much top notch. Don't expect this to be a masterpiece. It simply isn't, however it is a nice variation of a standard theme that has been used thousands of times before. The ending is quite strange, but rather delightful as well, as the entire cast is perhaps presenting some kind of musical number in danish, as each actor's name appears next to them. A very unique way of doing credits that I found refreshing and original. They appear in this short scene in costume that might better describe their individual role in the film. Although not a box office hit by any means, it's certainly not a dud either. Worth a second viewing.",1305590400,7,3597,4.5184049079754605

8162434,4,B000LO094M,"Overall, this is probably a 3.5  for me, BUT I give it an extra star because:

1. It  was made in 1987 and is way  ahead of its time for acceptance and showing a gay relationship in the context of normal. You will not find a US film during this period that dealt with gay teens in any way.  The few films made during that period were absolutely horrible and showed gays  in a very negative way.
2. It portrayed sensitive relationships and the acting was very natural. It had a very sweet quality to it

There were awkward elements like  what happened to Henrik? (Maybe I missed something)  And the ending was oddball to say  the least; although there were no subtitles so maybe there was a message in the song. Regardless, the ending could have been much better.  One note. This film is listed as 1987  and 2007 (I'm guessing  a rerelease).  IMDB says 1987 and note the use of a Walkman  cassette player, turntables (still the best sound!) and a WHAM poster on a wall.

I am surprised at the films made outside the US during the 80s  and 90s. A  notable few:  Maurice  (unfortunately hard to find except on Region 2  DVD), A Beautiful Thing, My Beautiful Launderette.",1492646400,,1167,4.410377358490566
8162435,1,B000LO094M,Bought this on dvd when it first went on sale.  I recently burned it as I found it in the bottom of a drawer.  Utter crap and the narrative on the back was so misleading.

8162436,3,B000LO094M,"For the most part it was a touching story. Showing the discrimination that happens in Europe as here wasn't a surprise but disappointing just the same in that that I always thing of Europeans being more open and free about sex, and this film is dated 2007. My only complaint is the cheesy musical number that ends the film. For me the film switched gears entirely and it was so badly performed that I had to fast-forward to the end. Still, it is worth viewing.",1486339200,,460,4.423529411764706
8162437,5,B000LO094M,"I love this movie, especially in the context of when it was made.  In the 1980's, all gay characters in US-produced films were either portrayed as crazy, or they died.  Usually from AIDS.  Sometimes suicide.  Or all of the above.  Not so in this film.  Yes, the plot is somewhat meandering, but so is life.  And yes, the end is rather....bizarre...but it's pretty funny, and obviously a parody of something that I'm too culturally backward to understand.  (There are some decent British gay-themed movies from the 1980's -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fruit-Machine-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B000PMGRQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fruit Machine [NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom</a>] isn't bad, although not nearly as positive as Friends Forever.  Another one, which I think was a TV show and which you can probably find on YouTube, from 1987, is TWO OF US.)  From a U.S.-centric perspective, the ""no big deal"" attitude towards homosexuality that Friends Forever conveys, was at least 20 years ahead of its time.  This is by far the best movie out of all of the ones I've watched thanks to this benefit of the ""Prime"" membership.  (Most of these free movies are utter crap!)  This one's definitely not - quite the opposite, in fact - highly recommended.",1484956800,2,1349,5.586206896551724
