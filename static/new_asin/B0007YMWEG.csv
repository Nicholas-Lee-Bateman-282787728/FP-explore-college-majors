8054679,4,B0007YMWEG,"This is truly a Joe D'Amato classic! Released in 1979, Tough to Kill delivers action, adventure and a ending you would never see coming! For the low price you pay, it is a great deal. Highly recommended to all Joe D'Amato fans.

Movies comes in deluxe widescreen and is dubbed in Eng. Includes no special features, just a menu with a chapter select. Movie includes Donald O'Brien (Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals) and the women who did the infamous wine bottle scene in D'Amato's Erotic Nights of the Living Dead.",1193961600,,514,4.711111111111111

8054681,2,B0007YMWEG,"OK, this is a true case of getting what you paid for. It's a cheap release (which is good because I'm not sure the movie is worth more than ten bucks) but, be warned: NO extras and this is OBVIOUSLY a transfer from a VHS copy. The image is soft and the  colors are either washed out or muddy. Nothing worse than an old VHS tape though. It's also ""letterboxed"" but I'm not sure I believe it, it looks more like a matte put on after it was transfered to DVD.

The movie itself is just OK, it has a few strong moments, but this sort of thing has been done better (the excellent ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" from 1960 comes to mind or, strangely, Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" has a similar character dynamic). To it's credit, though, ""Tough to Kill"" is kind of early in the mercenary/war cycle that really hit its stride by the mid 80's when Golan Globus' Cannon films was churning out hundreds of Rambo knock-offs!

The plot is pretty standard but the characters are nastier (imagine if every character was Tom Berenger in ""Platoon""!). The locations are under-used and the cinematography is just God-awful! Also, even though it's a classic 42nd street device, the use of racism in this film can be hard to take at times.

Still, despite everything I just wrote, I'm glad that these obscure, little Z-grade films get DVD releases. I'm a big fan of the film's lead, Luc Merenda, so I was happy to get this. If you like 70's Italian jungle films with miserable characters inflicting pain on everyone around them than this is for you!",1119916800,8,1517,4.505454545454546
