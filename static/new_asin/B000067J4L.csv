1716787,1,B000067J4L,I thought this years King of the Ring was on of the worst in WWE History.  The Main event was as bad as all the other one's this year.  The best match was Kurt Angle and Hollywood Hogan.  The only reason this was the best match was becdause Angle carried Hogan through the whole match and then made him tap.,1027814400,,307,4.083333333333333

1716789,2,B000067J4L,"Once again the WWE falls short of putting on a worthy June Pay-Per-View. For the most part the whole card was slow paced. Not one of the King of the Ring Tournament matches were any good. Triple H and Undertaker, well, what do you expect? Taker's 40 years old, and Triple H hasn't been as good since he had his surgery. The only match I would consider watching over is the Angle v.s. Hogan match, but that's just because I think Kurt Angle is the best in the WWE. So the only reason I gave this PPV 2 stars is because I liked the pyrotechnics display at the beginning and the big chair in the king of the ring set was nice. Anybody that gave this more than 3 stars has obviously never seen a good WWE Pay-Per-View.",1025913600,2,714,4.181159420289855

1716791,4,B000067J4L,"The WWE continues to put on good pay per views in 2002 with June's King of the Ring. With the sudden loss of Stone Cold Steve Austin, the wrestlers and the company itself manage to entertain just as well as before.
1. King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Chris Jericho vs Rob Van Dam - It has been called the match of the night. These two rising young stars are able to entertain with a wonderful match that started off the show.
2. King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Brock Lesnar vs Test - A good match that is fairly stiff. Test and Lesnar wail on each other throughout the match with plenty of brawling and power moves.
3. Cruiserweight Title: Hurricane (c) vs Jamie Noble - A good cruiserweight match with two wonderful wrestlers. Sadly, they seemed to wrestle like heavyweights during this match instead of using their cruiserweight talents to their advantage.
4. Women's Title: Trish Stratus (c) vs Molly Holly - A basic womens match with nothing too extradinary. It is good to see the WWE make better use of their women in the recent year.
5. Ric Flair vs Eddie Guerrero -  A well paced match with a mix of old skool style with the modern fast paced style. Flair begins his ""last good run"" with an impressive bout against Guerrero. Eddie was suppose to face Steve Austin, but since Austin's sudden departure, Flair picked up the dropped ball and has run with it.
6. Hulk Hogan vs Kurt Angle - The Hulkster faced the Olympic Gold Medalist in an impressive match. It was at the first KOTR ppv in 1993 that Hogan had his last match in the WWF until Feb. 2002, now Hogan returns and manages to keep up with Angle's speed and endurance. Angle continues to wear the wig he's had since losing his hair from Edge at Judgment Day. Surprisingly, Hogan taps out to Angle's ankle lock which is a very rare feat indeed.
7. King of the Ring Finals: Rob Van Dam vs Brock Lesnar - As a mark for RVD, I was cheering for him the entire time. This is the one point of this pay per view that disappointed me. Lesnar gets a win over RVD to become the 2002 King of the Ring, which also gives him a title shot at Summerslam in August. But since Lesnar only debuted on wrestling TV two months ago, does he really deserve this spot in the company? Only time will tell.
8. WWE Title: Undertaker (c) vs Triple H - A rematch from last year's Wrestlemania X-7 match, these two veterans provide the fans with an impressive match. The Rock commentates for a while before getting involved in the match himself. One can only imagine how much longer we'll get to see the Undertaker before he has to step aside for the young blood to rise.
A more than decent pay per view by far. With backstage segments involving Bubba Ray Dudley, Lance Storm, Christian, Booker T, Goldust, X-Pac, Big Show, Kevin Nash, and Shawn Michaels, King of the Ring 2002 is another great product by the WWE.",1024876800,16,2842,4.413333333333333

1716823,2,B000067J4L,"When I was younger and I loved wrestling. I love the way the wove the angles and how it played out into matches. The King of the Ring was one of my favorite events. The WWE use to be so good at story telling and setting a PPV up, now adays everything feels thrown at you and unprepared expect for the world title match. Its too bad they did away with this PPV.

Chris Jericho vs Rob Van Dam: Two of the best wrestlers to ever lace boots in WWE. Probably the only real reason to watch this event.

Brock Lesnar vs Test: Brock was unstoppable at this point in his career. Good big man vs big man match, but you knew who was going win it.

Hurricane vs Jamie Noble: Decent match but nothing speical.

Trish Stratus vs Molly Holly: If you read my other WWE reviews, you'll know what I have to say about this match.

Ric Flair vs Eddie Guerrero: I would have loved to see Guerrero facing Austin instead of Flair but it was a good match. The ending really took away from what could have been a classic match.

Hulk Hogan vs Kurt Angle: I never really cared for Hogan, he had decent matches but I felt he kept alot of talent down in the early 90's. He did tap out to Angle but this match could have been much better.

Golddust, Booker T, and Rock then had a little skit. It was really funny and probably the best thing out of the whole card. Scary to say but besides RVD-Jericho, nothing really stood out.

Rob Van Dam vs Brock Lesnar- Its a shame the way RVD was used in WWE early on. Sure he won titles but he would have been an amazing world champion in this era of WWE. Of course, Lesnar was the next big thing and that gives you the ending.

Undertaker vs Triple H: A good match but both men seemed to be really slow in there delivery. Rock comes in towards the end but to no avail and Taker wins with a weak roll up. NWO does not help Triple H although they are seen talking to him before the match.

A sad ending to a great PPV franchise. Sure they brought it back briefly with Booker T winning it but I don't think anyone can remember it. I wish they'd bring back this PPV the way it use to be in the 90's.",1196035200,,2107,4.055421686746988
1716824,4,B000067J4L,Excellent product.  It was purchased to add to my son's wrestling collection of dvds and products.  It is always fun to watch the ones from years back to see how they have changed over the years.,1180828800,,195,4.388888888888889
1716825,3,B000067J4L,"This is the last of the King Of The Ring series and it was aired live from the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross provide the play-by-play and color. Here are my ratings of the matches based out of 5 *****:

  King Of The Ring Semi-Finals:

Match #1: Rob Van Dam (Intercontinental Champion) vs. Chris Jericho - RVD gets a huge ""pop"" from the crowd as chants of ""Rob Van Dam"" and ""ECW"" fill the arena. Chris Jericho plays the role of heel to perfection. RVD lands multiple kicks to Y2J's head, a somersault plancha to the outside of the ring, rolling thunder splash and a split-legged top-of-the-rope moonsault onto Jericho.  But, Y2J is able to execute a double-armed top-of-the-rope suplex and a lion-sault onto ""Mr. Pay-Per-View"". This wasn't enough for Y2J as RVD hits a top-rope 5-star frog-splash and pins Jericho. Check the ending. Rating - ***1/2 (15 minutes)

Match #2: Test vs Brock Lesner (w/ Paul Heyman) - This was a pretty decent big man match as both guys really belt each other pretty hard. The beginning goes back and forth with both guys pounding on the other. Brock lands a spine-buster, back-breaker and power slam on Test. Test is able to connect with a sidewalk slam, a full-nelson slam and a pumphandle slam. But with some interference from Paul E., Brock connects with a F5 and pins Test. This was a pretty decent match and I wish Test would get more of a push as he is a very good wrestler. Overall rating - ***1/2 (8min 30sec)

Cruiserweight Championship: The Hurricane(C) vs Jamie Noble (w/ Nidia) - This was another decent match as both guys are decent wrestlers. Hurricane Helmsly has a grudge to settle with Noble, as he stole his girl Nidia from him. Hurricane is able to land a couple of big-time moves such as: suplex from inside to outside the ring, a top-rope cross-body block to the outside, a top-rope swinging neck breaker and a power-bomb choke slam. But Noble is very resilient and tough as nails. Is The Hurricane able to get his revenge and keep his belt? A pretty good match. Rating- ***1/2 (12min)

Ric Flair vs Eddie Guerrero - The ""Nature Boy"" is gunning for one more big push, but ""Latino Heat"" is his first obstacle. This was the ""stiffest"" match on the card as both men really chop each other with ferocity. Ouch! Eddie does some great mocking of Flair, and as well as tremendous ring psychology on Flair. Eddie and Flair both execute their ""finishers"" on each other. There was outside interfence from Chris Benoit and also from Bubba Ray Dudley. Who benefited the most from the interference? Another decent match. Rating - ***1/2 (18min)

Hulk Hogan vs Kurt Angle - Hulk gets a huge ""pop"" and Angle gets a heels welcome. The crowd was super pumped for this match and was into this from the start. Angle is able to ""Angle slam"" the Hulkster, but the crowd helps Hogan to ""Hulk up""! Hogan connects with the big boot to Angle's head, and rips off Angle's head gear exposing Angle's bald head. Angle gets pissed and introduces a chair to the ring. Is the Hulkster able to take Angle out of his game plan and score the pin? This was the most exciting match on the card. Rating - **** (12min)

King Of The Ring Final: Rob Van Dam(Intercontinental Champion) vs Brock Lesnar (w/ Paul Heyman) - Rob Van Dam has the crowd behind him but Brock has his strength. Brock lands a standing power-slam with back-to-back backbreakers on RVD. RVD connects with his rolling thunder splash as well as his 5-star top-rope frog-splash onto Lesnar. Is it enough for ""Mr Pay-Per-View""? Who is the new and last King Of The Ring? Rating - *** (5min)

WWE Undisputed Championship - The Undertaker(C) vs Triple H - This was also a decent match as both guys landed big shots on the other. The match flowed from in the ring to outside of the ring as the Undertaker was very methodical and precise with his moves. Paul E. is initially at ringside providing color for the match, but the Rock cames down and chases Paul E. away. As the match flowed to the outside of the ring, The Undertaker suddenly attacks The Rock. How does this effect the outcome of the match? Who is the Undisputed Cahmpion? Rating - ***1/2 (23min)

This disc has added bonus features of King Of The Ring Preliminary and Quarterfinal match highlights as well as interviews with Kurt Angle, Test and Jamie Noble. The best part of this disc was the backstage shoot with Goldust, Booker T and The Rock. Goldust does a great mimick of The Rock, and The Rock is hilarious with his repartee. That being said, I guess you can figure out that this wasn't the best pay-per-view WWE has done. I would rent it first or tape it if possible.",1124064000,3,4643,4.5673076923076925

Rob Van Dam v. Chris Jericho

  This was a good way to kick off of the show.  RVD and Y2J are both great talents and put on a great match and RVD won moving him to the finals of King of the Ring. 8/10

Brock Lesnar v. Test

  This was a great match and way better than the first King of the Ring match.  Brock and Test both are powerhouses and they had a great war with Lesnar winning and moving on to face RVD. 10/10

The Hurricane v. Jaime Noble  Cruiserweight Title

  This match was not worth your time to watch because it drags on and nothing exciting happens.  Noble steals the Cruiserweight Title. 2/10

Ric Flair v. Eddie Guerrero

  This was a great match then Bubba Dudley came down and ruined the whole thing and helped Flair pick up the victory over Eddie. 8/10

Trish Stratus v. Molly Holly  Women's Title

  This was a very boring match and this rivalry goes on for way to long.  Molly Holly pickes up the win and is new Women's Champion. 2/10

Hulk Hogan v. Kurt Angle

  This was a very good match even though I thought that it was gonna be bad.  Hogan taps out to the Ankle Lock and this is the only time in his career that he has ever taped out. 8/10

Brock Lesnar v. Rob Van Dam

  Lesnar puts on 2 great matches at one pay-per-view and he wins both of them.  RVD put up a good fight but Brock wins and goes to SummerSlam. 10/10

Undertaker v. Triple H  World Title

  This match was very good and it was surprising with The Rock returning.  Undertaker retains his title when he hit a Low Blow on Triple H. 7/10

1716843,2,B000067J4L,"This PPV marked the last appearance for King of the Ring as a PPV.  This PPV suffered from Austin leaving the WWF right before and Edge injuring his shoulder in a great cage match with Angle on Smackdown.  Things had to be completely rewritten, and it shows.

1. RVD vs. Chris Jericho (KOTR Semifinal #1)

Watching this match first made it seem like this was going to be a great PPV.  Match of the night by far.  These two worked well together.  Fantastic finish.  (9/10)

2. Test vs. Brock Lesnar (KOTR Semifinal #2)

This match was short, but was actually pretty entertaining.  Test put on a good match and seemed to carry Lesnar.  (8/10)

3. The Hurricane vs. Jamie Noble (Cruiserweight Title)

Noble's first appearance on a WWE PPV.  I thought this could be match of the night, but it was a bit of a letdown.  OK match, but nothing too exciting.  (7.5/10)

4. Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair

This was supposed to be Austin vs. Guerrero, but we all know what happened.  The fued was thrown together at the last minute.  The two actually worked well together.  This match featured the return of Chris Benoit to PPV's.  Bubba Dudley makes a surprise appearance.  (8/10)

5. Trish Stratus vs. Molly Holly (Women's Title)

Does anyone really care?  (2/10)

6. Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Kurt Angle

I was scared this woudl be a dud, but it actually turned out to be a decent match because of Angle.  He carried Hogan throughout the match.  Very surprising ending.  (8/10)

7. RVD vs. Brock Lesnar (KOTR Final/Winner Gets a Shot at Undisputed Title at Summerslam)

Short and very predictable match.  Everyone knew who was going to be the King of the Ring before the tournament started.  (6/10)

8. Triple H vs. Undertaker (Undisputed Title)

Boring match that suffered because of Triple H's injured elbow.  Good chair shot taken by Triple H in the match.  The Rock's appearance seemed like a waist in this match.  Not a good match.  (5.5/10)

I do not recommend buying this DVD.  The only good match is RVD vs. Jericho

1716844,5,B000067J4L,"After watching some poor wrestling at Backlash, and a small improvement at Judgement Day, KOTR was an excellent example of the WWE at its best! The KOTR tournament started out quickly and had two great matches, with Brock Lesnar and RVD duking it out in the finals. The championship matches were outstanding, with the women's and cruiserweight matches involving great moves and finishers (you never knew how the match would end!). The match I enjoyed the most was when Triple H and the Undertaker squared off for the Undisputed Championship. It was full of moves and surprises, and almost felt like a triple threat match when the Rock entered the ring and tried to take out the Undertaker. This match was also appealing since I am a fan of the Undertaker, and him defending the title was better than him winning it at Judgement Day!

1716880,1,B000067J4L,"King of the Ring 2002 was one of the most boring and uneventful ppv's in a long while.  Absolutely nothing of interest happened at this ppv. There were only two watchable matches and the rest of the card is terrible.
KOR Semifinal-RVD d. Chris Jericho: this was easily the best match of the night and it was the opener! Great back and forth action with RVD pulling out the win. Set the tone for a great night, but that didn't happen. 8/10
KOR Semifinal-Brock Lesnar d. Test: this was a pretty good match.
Test and Lesnar really put on an extremely hard hitting match that ends with Lesnar pinning Test. 5/10
Ric Flair d. Eddie Guerrero: this was a dull match with no buildup. Only put on the card to replace Austin vs. Guerrero. Interference from Bubba Ray Dudley gives Flair the victory. 2/10
Cruiserweight Title - Jamie Noble d. Hurricane: this really didn't deserve a spot on the ppv, especially since Noble had only been around for 3 weeks. Noble wins with the help of Nidia, even though she did a lousy job of making it look like she did anything. 2/10
Women's Title - Molly Holly d. Trish Stratus: once again this did not deserve a spot on ppv. Molly wins by grabbing the tights, even though she didn't really grab them until Trish had already been counted down. How come everyone who was supposed to cheat to win messed up in the actual cheating part? 2/10
Kurt Angle d. Hulk Hogan: this was the second best match of the night. Angle does a great job of making anyone look good, even that bald joke of a wrestler Hulk Hogan. Some great action in this match. 6/10
KOR Final - Brock Lesnar d. RVD: this final left no doubt who would win the title shot at SummerSlam. Who really thought RVD would get a main event, even though he deserves it two hundred times as much as that goon Lesnar. Lesnar wins with help from Heyman. Short match, nothing special. 3/10
Undisputed WWE Title - Undertaker d. Triple H: this was easily the worst main event I have ever seen. Slow paced, dull, fall asleep, boring match. Trips was injured, Taker didn't have it on this night. Easily Triple H's worst match in a while. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those internet Triple H haters who think they know what is going on in the WWE lockerrooms, I am a huge Triple H fan, but this match is bad. The Rock interferes and salvages any possible entertainment out of the match. If you buy this, fast forward to the end of the match to see Rock's interference, its the only good part. Awful overall match. 2/10
Overall this ppv gets a 30/80 which is utterly terrible. If you want a good 2002 ppv get SummerSlam, Survivor Series, or Judgment Day as they are packed with excellent matches. If you want to see a good Triple H-Undertaker match get WrestleMania X7, its classic.",1062115200,7,2755,4.433925049309665
1716881,4,B000067J4L,"In a rare instance, WWE packaged a decent DVD for a sub-par pay-per-view.  Included as an extra feature is the conclusion of every non-PPV match of the King of the Ring tournament.  Most segments last in length between one minute to two and a half minutes.  This feature was key toward making this DVD worth a purchase.
All things considered, 2002 King of the Ring was not a total waste.  The opening match between Chris Jericho and Rob Van Dam was twenty-minutes of a great match, but more significantly, it marked the end of chrisjericho.com when Jericho announced that he would no longer turn to the Internet for feedback since fans had unmercilessly slaughtered his effort that night.
The match between Test and Brock Lesnar was the hardest-hitting match of the night.  There was very little suspense in the outcome, as most experts predicted a meteoric rise for the ""Next Big Thing,"" but personally, this match was the first time that I appreciated Brock Lesnar's performance.
Honestly, the event started like an unforgettable night, but unfortunately, the feeling ended after the third match.  The first match that could have been better was between Eddie Guerrero and Ric Flair (substituting for then-disgruntled Steve Austin).  The night never seemed to recover after that disappointment.
A ridiculous ending marred the Kurt Angle/Hollywood Hulk Hogan match, and Rob Van Dam and Brock Lesnar didn't give us a match that we could call classic.  (They improved in subsequent matches on RAW and at Vengeance.)  The main event match between Undertaker and Triple H was so bad that its highlight was arguably the encounter between Triple H and his estranged friends in the NWO (Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, X-Pac), which occurred before the introductions even began.
If WWE could do this event over again, you have to imagine there would be a lot of changes.  But considering how the event went down, the DVD was a surprisingly enjoyable keepsake.",1052524800,,1949,5.006191950464396
1716882,3,B000067J4L,"1. King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Chris Jericho vs Rob Van Dam - I found this to be one of the more entertaining matches of the PPV. I'm a sucker for the work of Chris Jericho, and I feel that a Jericho/Van Dam feud would be great! I don't know if this would be the match of the night, but it was definitely one of the better matches.

2. King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Brock Lesnar vs Test - I liked the psychology of this match with Lesnar doing everything he could to get out of the way of Test's big boot. This was a power match, plain and simple. Nothing too complex. It was also fairly short. Not bad, for what it is.

3. Cruiserweight Title: Hurricane (c) vs Jamie Noble - This was the first PPV that Jamie Noble wrestled in. He had made his appearance several weeks prior and had begun a feud with Hurricane. This match was okay, but nothing special. As a cruiserweight match, it kind of stunk. As I understand it, the Cruiserweight division is where we should be seeing the high-flying offense that the big men cannot do. Sadly, this was mostly a mat-based match. Even so, I like the Hurricane, so it isn't all bad.

4. Women's Title: Trish Stratus (c) vs Molly Holly - The women's division has been steadily improving recently. Trish Stratus is one of the hardest working women in the WWE to become a credible wrestler. I respect that, but I find her character to not be very interesting. Molly Holly, on the other hand, is a talented woman and does not fit into the stereotype of the ""Diva"". I find this refreshing and her character interesting. This match was somewhat better than expected.

5. Ric Flair vs Eddie Guerrero - This was a match that was not supposed to happen. Guerrero was being put into a program with Steve Austin, but Austin walked out on the job and Flair stepped up to fill the spot in the PPV. With very little build up, this was one of the best matches of the night. Flair is rightfully a legend and can still entertain in the ring. Now that Guerrero is living clean again, he is one of the best performers in the WWE (now if he would only lose that accent...the one he didn't have in WCW). The was a more traditional mat wrestling clinic, with Flair proving that he can still ""go"" when called upon. Excellent match.

6. Hulk Hogan vs Kurt Angle - I know that Hogan is a legend, but I don't find him that entertaining. He is the same wrestler he was in the 80's, with no growth of character. That said, this match was better than I expected. Kurt Angle can pull a good match out of a mop (speaking of mops, Angle is still wearing the wig to cover up his bald head following the ""Hair vs Hair"" match against Edge), and he pulled one out of Hogan. Even with Angle in the match, it was better than it should have been, so hats off to Hogan and Angle for turning in a good match.

7. King of the Ring Finals: Rob Van Dam vs Brock Lesnar - Normally, I wouldn't give away who is in the final match of a tournament, but if you watch WWE programming, you know who won the match and got the title shot at Summerslam. This match was better than Lesnar/Test, but not quite as good as Jericho/Van Dam. Lesnar's main flaw is not his ring ability, but the fact that he does not get the crowd involved. He methodically goes to work and works on the opponent, but unlike Goldberg (a poor wrestler, but someone who got loud cheers), Lesnar does not play to the crowd. An okay match, not very long, but accomplished what it needed to for the story.

8. WWE Title: Undertaker (c) vs Triple H - While not as good as their match from Wrestlemania 17, this was not a terrible match. HHH was working hurt (his arm really was in bad shape), so was not able to perform at a top level. While a disappointing match, this wasn't as bad a match as some might have you believe. There was the expected run-in by The Rock, and while I am usually against any sort of interference in a Championship match, it was a saving grace.

This PPV was merely average. It featured a couple of interesting promo spots. One was a comedy spot featuring The Rock, Booker T, and Goldust (does Dustin Runnels get more entertaining as time goes on? I think so). The other was a brief interaction between the NWO (at the time, Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, X-Pac, and Big Show) and Triple H. This is made interesting because of the real life friendship of Nash, Michaels, and Sean Waltman (X-Pac). Michaels, HHH and Waltman were part of Degeneration X, and with Nash (and Scott Hall) were members of the ""Kliq"". The suggestion was made that if HHH needed help in his match, all Hunter had to do was raise his fingers and make the sign and the NWO would come to his aid. It was an interesting angle and unfortunately, nothing ever came of it.",1048550400,2,4719,4.306306306306307
1716883,1,B000067J4L,"This was the most boring ppv of 2002 and delivered one of the worst wwe title matches of all time. Triple H vs Undertaker is brutal to watch and is nothing but slow plodding offense. Triple H hasn't had a good match since his return, and continues to tank wwe ratings, yet he uses his backstage power to stay in the main events. Undertaker needs to RETIRE, period. Kurt Angle vs Hulk Hogan is a pretty good match and Hogan puts Angle OVER. Something Triple H needs to learn. The actual tournament is nothing special and the crowd is DEAD through most of it. Lesner wins, deflating the crowd, because he wasn't OVER yet. This event is terrible! Stay Away, you've been warned!",1046563200,,674,4.487804878048781
1716884,3,B000067J4L,"Here's my rundown of the King of the Ring card at a bust of five stars:
King of the Ring Semi-Finals:
Chris Jericho vs Rob Van Dam
-The best match on the card without a doubt and a great match that started off the show. Both competitiors used lots of high flying offense and false finishes.<BR
King of the Ring Semi-Finals:
Brock Lesnar vs Test
-Both Brock and Test displayed tremendous strength in this match as they both suplexed eachother but Brock wins in a short amount of time to advance into the Semi-Finals.

WWE Cruiserweight Championship:
The Hurricane (c) vs Jamie Noble
-A very well wrestled technical bout from these two, mixed in with some high flying offense and this match delivers in a big way.

WWE Women's Championship:
Trish Stratus (c) vs Molly Holly
-Your basic women's match you could see on RAW. Nothing special.

Ric Flair vs Eddie Guerrero
-A tremendous match from ""The Nature Boy"" and Eddie Guerrero, both used technical wrestling offense and submissions. A run-in
from Bubba Ray Dudley gives Ric Flair the win.

Hulk Hogan vs Kurt Angle
-Suprisingly, a great match, Angle and Hogan both delivered a well wrestled bout. Both used suplexes and Angle used his trademark Anklelock on Hogan to make him tap to become the victor.

King of the Ring Finals:
Rob Van Dam vs Brock Lesnar
-RVD and Brock had a style's clash in the match. Brock with his suplexes and RVD with his unorthodox high flying offense. This match ended too soon in my view. With Brock Lesnar picking up the win with a devestating F-5 to become the 2002 King of the Ring!

Undisputed WWE Championship:
Underaker(c) vs. Triple H
-An intense war with lots of brawling and false finishes. Triple H and Undertaker delivered an okay match but The Rock saved the day suprisingly, with a great run-in, delivering Rockbottoms to both Triple H and Undertaker.

Bottom Line:
Not a bad PPV, but certainly not as good as the rest of the WWE PPVs this year, if your looking for a good King of the Ring PPV, I suggest King of the Ring 2001. As far as PPVs this year, check out these:
Royal Rumble

1716910,4,B000067J4L,"Well, KOTR has come and gone and Summerslam 02 has come and gone and Brock Lesnar ended up not being the Mable or Billy Gunn that everybody thought he would be.  So how do I review this now, knowing that Brock Lesnar is Undisputed champion just two months after this event.  Well, Ill start off with the low points of this PPV.
The Main Event title match between HHH and Undertaker was simply sad, very long, and very very slow, too bad this was the main event, because Im sure this match had a lot to do with the bad reviews. This was only 6 months after HHH's return to the ring from injury, and his difficulty adjusting shows big here.  THe heat for the match was terrible as well to help round out the all out clunker of a match *1/2.
Noble/Hurricane was decent enough, likely the best paced match of the event, but honestly I could care less about the match or the events leading up to it.  Chances are that the match would have been much better if Billy Kidman had won the contendership match. **.
Now, suprisingly the womens championship match was alright.  Molly Holly was brutal, and showed that she was actually tough.  Im glad she is over that horrible sidekick gimmick and a brutal heel like she was born to be.  Another good match was the Jericho/RVD match, most likely the best match of the card.  I also enjoyed Flair/Guerrero, a nice bit of work on their parts, and very cool to see this match historically. The Hogan/Angle match was alright, Angle tried hard, but Hogan is just getting too old to wrestle guys with the stamina of Kurt Angle. Brock Lesnar showed us that he could wrestle.
Though there were goods to the event, the bads outweighed them ten-fold.  HHH/Taker was so a HUGE dissappointment of a Main Event.  If that match had been decent, this event would feel much better.",1032134400,,1802,4.466463414634147

7963243,3,B000067J4L,"1.) King of the Ring Semi-Final Match: Chris Jericho vs RVD

Apparently this match had some controversy behind it as fans went online right after this match happened, the night of the PPV, and complained about how bad it was. Jericho picked a random wrestling forum website to go on and bashed every fan that complained about the match. To be fair, he was in the right. This match was really good. Jericho and RVD had only been in the ring with each other a couple of times before this match in 2001 and every time they fought, it was nothing short of excellent. Athleticism and great high-flying/technical wrestling is what you get in this match as Jericho and Van Dam beat the heck out of each other for a good near 10 minutes of this match. In the end, RVD knocks Jericho off the turnbuckle and connects with a 5 Star Frog Splash for the win. It was a really good match and quite possibly the match of the night. I don't see what there was to complain about. Just awesomeness. Jerry Lawler tries to interview RVD after the match about facing either Test or Brock Lesnar but Jericho attacks Van Dam putting him in the Walls of Jericho

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.) King of the Ring Semi-Final Match: Test vs Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman

This was a fairly plausible match for a battle of the big men type of match. Most matches with big guys move kind of slow but Test and Lesnar were on the mark in such a fast paced battle. Test got a fairly decent response from the crowd despite this match being heel vs heel. It was obvious that Lesnar would come out the winner, seeing as this was during his mass push, but that didn't stop it from being a great match. A distraction from Heyman to Test allows Lesnar to hoist Test up and drop him with the F5 for the win

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Backstage, The Coach enters the Raw locker room and asks some of the Raw superstars who they think, between RVD and Brock Lesnar will win the King of the Ring. Bubba Ray Dudley locks in his choice for Brock Lesnar, thinking his too tough to beat. Mark Lloyd goes in the Smackdown locker room to get some of the Smackdown stars' opinions on who will win. He gets Christian and Lance Storm who are pissed that Test and Jericho didn't make it to the finals to be an all Canadian match and how the finals will be in all American match. Christian bitterly states that WWE are prejudice against Canadians. Storm declares that as Canadians they won't get sucked into the pro-American abyss. This promo was just the early stages of the formation of The Un-Americans that was formed not too long after this PPV

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match: Jamie Noble w/Nidia vs The Hurricane

This feud all started with Hurricane receiving a series of mysterious letters on Smackdown. The letters turned out to be from no one other than Nidia, who was Hurricane's ex and still bitter. She would go on to align herself with Jamie Noble who she then revealed to be her new boyfriend and the one who would take the Cruiserweight Championship from Hurricane. Jamie Noble made his WWE PPV debut in this match that lasted a bit longer than most Cruiserweight matches tended to last back then--going well over 10 minutes. We get some standard action exchanged between Hurricane and Noble. This match didn't contain a lot of the jaw dropping, constant high-flying action that we usually got in Cruiserweight bouts but it was some good stuff, regardless. Nidia interferes quite a few times throughout this match on Noble's behalf but looking amazing in her country shorts. The end comes with Noble crotching Hurricane on the turnbuckle and drilling him into the mat with an impactful powerbomb for the win.

Terri Runnels interviews Eddie Guerrero about his upcoming match with Ric Flair. Eddie seems none too concerned about the match as he spends the interview dedicating the match to his family. Eddie mocks Flair for saying he has one last great run left and says the only run Flair is going to do is running to the retirement home when he gets through with him

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Ric Flair vs Eddie Guerrero

This was originally supposed to be Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Eddie Guerrero but after Austin's infamous departure from the company, the match was thrown together as Flair vs Guerrero that seemed rather rushed with a lack of true build up. Flair claimed he had one last great run in him and his first opponent for that run was Latino Heat, Eddie Guerrero. Eddie outwrestles and outperforms Flair quite a few times in the beginning but Flair gets into the match and comes back stylin' and profilin' like only he could. Whole lot of strikes going on this match and at one point the knife edge chop becomes just a little overused. After awhile, Chris Benoit comes to ringside to get a closer look at the action. While Eddie distracts the referee, Benoit drags Flair out of the ring and places him in the Crossface. The referee senses something happened and sends Benoit to the back. While the referee is busy dealing with Benoit, Bubba Ray Dudley sneaks in the ring from behind and hits the Bubba Bomb on Eddie. A high speed chase ensues through the crowd as Benoit chases after Bubba. Flair rolls back in the ring and pins Eddie for the win. A random but nicely competitive match between Guerrero and Flair. I think the less chops in the match, the better it would've been

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWE Women's Championship Match: Molly Holly vs Trish Stratus (c)

This match and this feud as a whole was all taking place over Trish making fun of Molly having a big butt. And you think the storylines for the divas today are laughable? Despite a rather comical storyline, the match itself was decent. Nothing too overly impressive but it was something. The divas division was really starting to take shape by mid-2002 and that's when a lot of improvements within it started taking place. In the end, Molly gets the win with a roll up on Trish, using a handful of tights

Mark Llloyd interviews Kurt Angle backstage about his upcoming match with Hulk Hogan calling it a ""Battle of the Real American Heroes"". Angle is insulted that Hogan is considered an American hero and says Hogan was only considered such because Vince McMahon told him he was going to be one. Angle says he's going to do something about it, runs down his King of the Ring history and says he's going to make Hogan tap faster than ""Mr. Bojangles on speed"". I had a good laugh at that quote.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Hulk Hogan vs Kurt Angle

It truly was a Battle of the Real Americans. 2 different superstars from 2 different eras of WWE. Not a bad match. Hogan was able to keep up with and match Angle's speed for the most part. Angle stays in control of Hogan for most of the match but that's pretty much every Hogan match as we knew what it was setting up for. Once Hogan makes his ""grandiose"" comeback and levels Angle with a big boot, he snatches Angle's ridiculous but silly wig off his head to reveal his bald head to a big pop from the crowd. Hogan puts the wig on and mocks Angle which infuriates the gold medalist. Angle grabs a steel chair and attempts to strike Hogan with it but he misses and it bounces off the ropes, ricocheting against Angle's head. Hogan level Angle with another boot to the face. Hogan goes for the Leg Drop but Angle counters it into the Ankle Lock. Hogan has nowhere to go and eventually taps to the Ankle Lock, giving Hogan the win

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hilarious backstage segment with The Rock, Booker T, and Goldust involving The Rock confronting Goldust about trying to impersonate him. Goldust gets called a sick FREAK for touching himself and being his usual Goldust freakish self. Words can't say how funny it is. Look it up on Youtube or check it out on the WWE Network if you haven't seen it yet

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) King of the Ring Final: Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman vs RVD

RVD vs Lesnar: Winner gets a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam; who would it be? The two favorites to win battle it out and this quick, fast paced match. RVD and Lesnar trade blows with each other with both getting in some nice displays of offense over each other. Lesnar counters a sprinboard crossbody from RVD into an F5 and that keeps RVD down long enough for the 3 count. Despite both men being favorites in the match, it should've been obvious from the get-go that Brock Lesnar was going to win the match. He did and his awesome push continued in to the summer.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Triple H is backstage walking out for his match when he encounters the NWO in the corridor. The NWO at this point was a joke that consisted of Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, X-Pac, and Big Show. Triple H shares a group hug with them as they encourage him to win the title. It's a good thing the NWO ended not too long after this. If it had continued, I guarantee you it would've been only a matter of time before Triple H ended up in the group

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWE Undisputed Championship Match: The Undertaker (c) vs Triple H

The WWE Undisputed Championship had gotten through a phase of hot potato between Wrestlemania and Judgment Day. It went from Chris Jericho to Triple H to Hulk Hogan to Undertaker and now Undertaker was defending the championship against one of the former champions. Triple H vs The Undertaker was much like Stone Cold vs The Undertaker at Backlash. It had been done and seen several times. Undertaker vs Triple H hadn't been done nearly as much as Austin vs Taker but it was enough to make you say enough was enough. The Rock played a wild card in this match as everyone was unsure of what his role would be in this match. This match was nothing to get excited about as nothing exciting really happened for most of its duration. And unfortunately it got 23 minutes of ring time. Undertaker. Lots of back and forth brawling....and brawling....and brawling.....and some more brawling. Much like Taker and Austin's last match at Backlash, Triple H and Taker's last match against each other (at the time) was a complete bore fest and even the crowd knew it as they barely made a peep. Their matches they had before were pretty great but the last one was just a bore snore. The crowd comes alive when The Rock's music plays and comes out to do commentary for the last 15 or so minutes of the match. The Rock ends up getting involved following a referee bump when he's attacked by The Undertaker. The Rock attacks Taker and accidentally slams a chair over HHH's head, busting him open. In the end, Taker retains, rolling Triple H up with the tights. After the match, The Rock storms the ring and lays out Undertaker with a Rock Bottom before getting caught with a Pedigree from HHH. Taker gets up moments later and lays out HHH with a Chokeslam. KOTR 2002 goes off the air with Taker standing tall over both men

Overall: This was unfortunately the last King of the Ring PPV in WWE. The King of the Ring tournament would return in 2006 as a traditional TV tournament special rather than it having its own PPV. I'll be honest, for its last PPV, this definitely wasn't a proper way for it to go out. While there were some pretty good matches on the card like RVD vs Jericho, Eddie vs Flair, and even RVD vs Lesnar, the atmosphere of the PPV overall just felt very bland. Everyone pretty much knew Lesnar was winning the King of the Ring tournament before the PPV even began, so there wasn't a whole lot of unpredictability going on like it had been in previous years there were multiple people that could've been seen as the winner. It didn't help that to top off an already low-key PPV, we got a boring snooze of a main event from 2 men that had much more exciting matches against each other in previous years. I don't know what it was about 2002. But when it came to Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Undertaker being in the ring with each other, it was kind of boring. Maybe it's because it had been seen before and we knew what to expect or maybe they just lost the chemistry they had with each other. Overall, there are 1 or 2 talking points from the 2002 King of the Ring but that's just about it. Overall, the 2002 King of the Ring is a forgettable PPV from the year 2002. If you want to buy the DVD, I only recommend getting it for the extras that include match qualifying recaps and interviews. Other than that, there's not much this PPV was good for",1435104000,,13446,5.004923903312444

7963246,3,B000067J4L,"King Of The Ring Semi-Finals Match: Chris Jericho Vs. RVD - Talk about a pure classic confrontation between two outstanding technical competitors to open up the show! I thought their Hardcore Title match last year was something but boy ol' boy, this match surely blows that match clear out the water. This match is something all right. What Jericho and Van Dam did in this match is certainly one of a kind (no pun intended). Their moves were great as well as their spectacular high flying offense, they had great false finishes and outstanding counters, and to put the cherry on top, the crowd was into this match 100 percent. This was an awesome match and match of the night without a doubt. 4.5/5

King Of The Ring Semi-Finals Match: Brock Lesnar w/ Paul Heyman Vs. Test - This match is the dead on definition of the word ""stiff."" Not saying that's a bad thing, the match is great in its own right but boy, these guys took a [...] load of hard hits in this bout. Brock and Test pulled out all the stops to make it to the Finals but the road there was surely a rocky one. These guys came out with a lot of hard slams including an awesome counter from Brock countering Test with a powerslam before Test delivered a devastating boot to the face of Brock that was heard around the arena. This was a hard fought battle between two guys that held their own but no disrespect to either Brock or Test, there was no way they were gonna top RVD and Jericho. 3.75/5

Cruiserweight Champion The Hurricane Vs. Jamie Noble w/ Nidia - This match was at the peak of the Cruiserweight division and it was a solid one at that. This was a great match between two guys that were on top of their game at the time with both guys using their size to perfection and the notion of Nidia getting involved numerous times. Noble takes a nasty fall on the outside after being suplexed by the Hurricane before he powerbombed his way to become the new Cruiserweight champion. 4/5

Ric Flair Vs. Eddie Guerrero - History will say this was supposed to be Stone Cold against Eddie but this was around the time when ""Austin took his ball and went home"" so Flair substituted in for him. This was also around the time Flair stated he still had one more good run left in him and by the show he put on here, he was right. Eddie focused on the leg of Flair which he started working on the previous RAW. Even applying Flair's own figure 4 leg lock on him before Flair made his comeback with the appearence of Chris Benoit. Benoit only had little interaction in the match as he had Flair in the Crippler Crossface on the floor while Bubba Ray Dudley interfered and delivered Eddie the Bubba Bomb to give Flair the win. This was an enjoyable match as I think it was better than their United States championship fights in WCW. 4/5

Women's Champion Trish Stratus Vs. Molly Holly - This was a fight from the start with Trish throwing her hat at Molly before the referee had to retrain Trish until the bell officaily rang. At the same time, this is a ""lost classic"" concerning the ladies as this was a great one on one match for the Women's Title. The match is good but the commentary does get annoying after a while with the constant [...] jokes from The King with JR getting in on the action from time to time. Again, this is a fine ladies contest that is better than their later rematch at Unforgiven. 3.25/5

Kurt Angle Vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - This was advertised as the battle of the real-Americans to find out who is the true real-American. But as far as I'm concerned, this was nothing more than Hogan embarrassing Angle and running all over him in a typical Hogan form. There's no way a guy like Hogan could stay incontrol of a match this long with an otustanding mat technician like Kurt Angle. However, the ending was the saving grace as Angle did a great job countering Hogan's leg drop to earn the tap out victory. I think this was one of Hogan's best matches in his 2002-2003 run but I really felt this was a lacklustering perfromance from Angle (aside from the ending). Thankfully, Angle made it up at the next PPV. 3.25/5

King Of The Ring Finals Match: Brock Lesnar w/ Paul Heyman Vs. RVD - As great as the first two King of the Ring matches were earlier in the night, this match was rather disappointing. Not because of the performance from either guys, but because of the match length. To only give 7 or 8 minutes for a match this pretigious only confuses me. Gladly, these two would put on a classic next month for the Intercontinental championship but gets over shadowed for no particular reason at all. But give the devil his due, for those 7 minutes, Brock and RVD went full throttle and gave a great perfromance. Good match with the match length only being its downfall. 3.5/5

WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker Vs. Triple H - For some reason, this match did not click at all. Maybe it was becuase of HHH's injured elbow but this match was not what it could've been. To sum the match up, it's just a slugfest with a few high impact maneuvers, HHH delivering a suplex to Taker on the floor being one of them, until The Rock made his arrival to do commentary. Once the fight breaks out, HHH gets bloody with The Rock making his presence known before the final 3 count. However, what happened after the match was more interesting than what happened during the match. This wasn't Undertaker's best title defense during his championship run but like Angle, he made it up next month. 3/5

In the end, this being the last King Of The Ring PPV, the KOTR ended on a good note. There was a great King of the Ring tournament with the great RVD/Jericho match. I certianly give this event a recommendation at a fair price. But I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to get this as soon as possible.",1291939200,,5772,4.413145539906103

The Ric Flair-Eddie Guerrero match was a pretty good match ruined by Chris Beniot's & Bubba Ray Dudley's interferences.

The RVD-Brock Lensar KOTR Finals was above-average at best. The HHH-Undertaker-World title match was a hard-fought,hard-hitting,entertaining,back-and-forth match with The Rock making it better.

Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam
Great opener, and the match of the night in my eyes. WWE gave them a good amount of time to put on a great wrestling match and showcase each other's best moves and styles in the ring, while at the same time not dragging the match out too long. A great match between two of the most entertaining performers to step in a WWE ring.
There's also a post-match interview with Jerry Lawler, but it's cut short when Jericho attacks RVD.

There's a promo here with Heyman building up Brock Lesnar backstage. It's pretty obvious from all the screen time that Lesnar's already in the middle of his massive and ridiculously early push to the main event scene here.

{King of the Ring Semi-Final}
Test vs. Brock Lesnar w/ Paul Heyman
It's not terrible but it's far from great as well. You may find yourself not caring about this match so much since Lesnar was still new, this being his third month in WWE, and also being a heel, and Test being Test, not exactly having much of a push in the WWE. He was also a bit of a tweener as well. It's still interesting to see Lesnar finally wrestle a guy that can match him in size and strength though. They both pull out some big hard hitting power moves. But for the most part, this pales in comparison to the first semi-final match.

We see some interviews in the Raw and SmackDown locker rooms on the result of the semi final matches. You can skip this. All you see here is Bubba Ray Dudley talking about making an impact at King of the Ring, and Lance Storm and Christian cutting a promo as the Un-Americans.

{WWE Cruiserweight Championship}
The Hurricane (c) vs. Jamie Noble w/ Nidia
This is really the first time (and one of the few times) I've seen The Hurricane get proper TV time and a decent storyline. The plot here is that someone's been stalking him on SmackDown, leaving him letters and notes. He finds out that it's Nidia, who is an ex-girlfriend from his past, and she's come back with Jamie Noble as her new boyfriend. They humiliate him, take his mask etc. all building up to the match.
The match itself was decent, and Jamie Noble's PPV debut. I have seen better cruiserweight matches, and better matches from both of them, but this was still watchable. Both have different styles for cruiserweights and use a lot of power moves mixed with highflying moves.
My only negative note here is that The Hurricane is made to look weak. Jamie Noble kicks out of both of The Hurricane's finishers (The Eye of the Hurricane and the Chokeslam) while Noble gets the easy pin after a simple powerbomb.
It would've been nice to see The Hurricane do something to get some heat back but oh well.

Terri Runnels is backstage, interviews Eddie Guerrero.

Ric Flair vs. Eddie Guerrero
I think this is really the only proper wrestling match on the card. It wasn't just another brawling sort of match, we actually got to see proper moves, holds, locks and submissions. Flair is in top form here as well. This is one of the longer matchs, running at 17 minutes. It's good, stays entertaining and doesn't get boring. At one stage, Chris Benoit comes out and locks Ric Flair in the Crossface outside of the ring. But then Bubba Ray Dudley makes his impact here by hitting Eddie Guerrero with a Bubba Bomb letting Flair pick up the win.

There's a promo between Chris Nowinski and William Regal at The World in Times Square, Nowinski mocks a waitress. Nothing too great here.

{WWE Women's Championship}
Trish Stratus (c) vs. Molly Holly
This match was okay, but not great. Had a lot of flaws, but still, Trish and Molly were definitely two of the better divas in the WWE, along with Lita and Victoria. Molly gets the cheap pin by holding the tights.

Interview with Kurt Angle, I miss seeing him in the WWE, he's a great heel.

Kurt Angle vs. Hulk Hogan
This was pretty entertaining. Hogan had been doing the rounds in the WWE since he returned in February, first wrestling The Rock, then Tripl H, then The Undertaker, now Kurt Angle. I was a bit skeptical about this since both wrestlers have completely different styles. Angle is more of a mat based technical wrestler and Hogan's just a straight up brawler with maybe three or four moves up his sleeve at the most. They pulled out a pretty decent match though. This was shortly after Angle lost his Hair vs Hair match against Edge, so he was still wearing a really cheap and pathetic wig, which of course got pulled off to the enjoyment of the fans.
Surprisingly, Hulk Hogan actually taps out here to the Ankle Lock. I can't remember too many, if any, times that Hulk Hogan has tapped out. I was really expecting him to get the win here. It was a good ending.

There's a pretty funny promo here between Booker T, Goldust and The Rock, with Goldust dressing up and talking like The Rock. Booker T and Goldust, as strange a pairing as they were, had some of the most entertaining promos.

{King of the Ring Finals}
Rob Van Dam vs. Brock Lesnar w/ Paul Heyman
The crowd were pro RVD as always, and I'm a massive mark for RVD, but I think everyone in the arena that night knew that Brock Lesnar would be winning. The WWE wouldn't have him squash every face on Raw and make it through the King of the Ring tournament virtually untouched just to have him lose in the last match to Rob Van Dam. The match was pretty short too, but that's understandable considering they'd both wrestled earlier in the night already.
This match was alright, but not great. They weren't given much time so they just ran with what they had. They had a rematch a month later at Vengeance which was much better than this match.

Awkward backstage moment with Triple H bumping into the new nWo (Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, X-Pac and Big Show).

{WWE Undisputed Championship}
Undertaker (c) vs. Triple H
The main event: It was okay. Nothing to write home about. You won't be quoting this as a classic matchup, for the most part it was a very standard brawl between two main event wrestlers. It wasn't overly one-sided, both Taker and Triple H got a lot of offense in. For some reason, Paul Heyman is doing guest commentary at the start here. Halfway through the match he mentions that Brock Lesnar ""punked out"" The Rock backstage and beat him up in his locker room. The inevitable ref bump happens, then Taker and Triple H take each other out with a clothesline. Enter The Rock, who runs Paul Heyman out of the arena. The Rock sits in with JR and The King momentarily until Undertaker gets him involved with a boot to the head. The referee is knocked out from one single bump for an excessively long time, probably a good 5+ minutes. Triple H takes a chairshot from The Rock by accident then a Last Ride. The Undertaker gets a Rock Bottom.
The climax of the match is so scattered and jumbled and anticlimactic. Triple H, The Undertaker and the referee are all trying to recover at the same time. Triple H kicks out of a Last Ride, then the referee isn't responsive to make the count for a Pedigree, then the Undertaker hits a low blow and a schoolboy for a very long and slow three count. The ending could have been much better.
After the match, The Rock runs into the ring, gives Undertaker a People's Elbow. Then Triple H gives The Rock a Pedigree. Then Undertaker gives Triple H a Chokeslam.
Like I said scattered and jumbled and anticlimactic.

---

Overall, King of the Ring 2002 was an average pay-per-view. Most of the 2002 pay-per-views weren't that special excluding SummerSlam, 'Mania X8 and Survivor Series. There wasn't much in the way of main eventers here as it suffered somewhat being the first pay-per-view since Austin walked out. All of the main event players here are basically Triple H, 'Taker, Angle and Hogan. The nWo were barely involved (which is probably a good thing in retrospect), The Rock had only just returned and thsu was not booked in any matchs, and Chris Benoit had only just come back from his neck injury, so he wasn't booked either. The main event was a bit of a letdown, and some of the matches in the undercard left quite a bit to be desired.
But that's not to say that King of the Ring is a total loss. Chris Jericho and Rob Van Dam put on an excellent match, almost worth buying the DVD just for that match alone. Even Lesnar and RVD have some chemistry in the ring, but they just don't have a lot of time here. Hogan and Angle is better than expected and the Cruiserweight title match is entertaining.
Overall, if you can find this DVD cheap somewhere, it's worth taking a look at. If you want to see Lesnar getting crowned King Brock, The Rock's return and Hulk Hogan tapping out, then you'll like King of the Ring. Otherwise, save your money for better wrestling DVDs.",1275523200,,8719,4.491482649842271
7963249,4,B000067J4L,"The 2002 edition of the WWE's King of the Ring took place on June 23, 2002 at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio.  This pay-per-view, like most, has its ups and its downs, but in the end, I think you will find it is worth the time and money to see it, especially if you can get it at a good price.

Leading up to the event, Raw and Smackdown hosted their specific sections of the King of the Ring tournament.  This guaranteed that we would see two Smackdown superstars and two Raw superstars in the semi-final matches on the pay-per-view.  Canadians, Chris Jericho and Test advanced from the separate Smackdown brackets, while up-and-coming rookie Brock Lesnar and veteran Rob Van Dam took the Raw brackets.  This led us to the start of the pay-per-view and our first two matches of the night...

KING OF THE RING TOURNAMENT SEMI-FINAL MATCH (***3/4)
Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam
---A very solid opener that set the bar very high for the rest of the night.  The two ECW originals had great chemistry in this one.  The ending, timing, psychology, etc. were all just right to make this a special match.

KING OF THE RING TOURNAMENT SEMI-FINAL MATCH (**1/2)
Brock Lesnar (w/Paul Heyman) vs. Test
---While they didn't measure up to the previous match's technical skills, this one made up for it in physicality.  Test really works stiff on Lesnar here, and we even see a big boot early in the match that catches the ""Next Big Thing"" off guard.  The ending made the rookie from Minnesota look dominate, but it could have been better, as Heyman didn't need to get involved.

WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH (***)
Jamie Noble (w/Nidia) vs. The Hurricane (C)
---This advanced the pay-per-view nicely into its second hour with a solid combination of high-flying moves and ground attacks, making this match a solid one.  Noble's pay-per-view debut with Nidia, the former girlfriend of The Hurricane, is an impressive one, especially since he gets to work with his former WCW counterpart.  While the later days of WCW were difficult to see, these two were two of the brighter stars of the company.  Here, they show you why.

SINGLES MATCH (**3/4)
Ric Flair vs. Eddie Guerrero
---Flair is out to a nice, respectful ovation after declaring that he had ""one last run"" in him.  The 16-time former world champion had quite a battle with a future world champion in Guerrero.  The time given to this match may have been a little much, and the ending seemed a bit overbooked (with a bit of interference).  However, getting to see two of the greatest in-ring performers of all time is rarely anything that you should miss.

WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH (**1/2)
Molly Holly vs. Trish Stratus (C)
---This match was, surprisingly, pretty entertaining.  Don't get me wrong; these two are very good workers, but this match went beyond ""techinically good"".  Molly takes some hard falls in the match, and Trish looks as good as ever.  It's not the best match of the night, but definately not the worst.

SINGLES MATCH (***1/4)
Kurt Angle vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan
---Many may wonder, when seeing this on the card, how Hogan can possibly stay with the mat-based former Olympic champion.  Quite frankly, I thought this match was your typical big names, bad match combination, but to their credit, Hogan and Angle put on a nice match here.  The wig that Angle is wearing after losing his hair at Judgment Day is used nicely for playing the crowd, and Angle carries Hogan to a good match.  Many people also say ""If you've seen one Hogan match, you've seen them all"".  However, the ending of this match calls for Hogan to do something he had never done in the red and yellow.

KING OF THE RING TOURNAMENT FINAL MATCH (*3/4)
Rob Van Dam vs. Brock Lesnar (w/Paul Heyman)
---This match, given more time, could have been excellent.  However, with only five minutes and change to work with, Van Dam and Lesnar could only do so much here.  Putting over Lesnar as the dominate force to face the champion at Summerslam was the logical thing to do, but WWE did not do that here.  Van Dam was hot with the crowd at the time, but in making a superstar, such as Lesnar, sometimes he has to get big victories over key players.  This was not a clean victory, as it should have been, and in my mind, Lesnar looked no more stronger for it.  Nonetheless, (***SPOILER***) the ""Next Big Thing"" becomes the ""Next Big King"".

WWE UNDISPUTED CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH (****)
Triple H vs. Undertaker (C)
---Some people say this match started really slow, but I disagree.  Paul Heyman would stay out and do commentary for this match (at least for the time being), and his constant ""Brock Lesnar, Brock Lesnar"" talk actually takes away from this match, not to mention Vengeance.  It's like they are completely ignoring the pay-per-view to look at Summerslam.  However, Big Evil and The Game put on a show in this one that, unlike Guerrero vs. Flair, was overbooked in the right way.  We see the return of the People's Champ, The Rock, to chase away Paul Heyman, and after that, this match gets interesting.  Many false endings, two outstanding legends, and solid commentary (after Heyman) make this one a lost classic.  Would The Rock be more involved?  Yes.  How? In a big way.

In the end, I would definately recommend this pay-per-view.  We also see backstage segments featuring (among others) Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, Booker T, Goldust, Big Show, and X-Pac.  While it's not a five star event (and for me that's a hard mark to reach), King of the Ring 2002 is the next closest thing...a classic event from a solid year of wrestling that shouldn't be missed.",1231200000,,5609,4.700819672131147
7963250,4,B000067J4L,"It seems that KING OF THE RING 2002 doesn't have a good reputation here on Amazon.  I'm here to say that while criticisms are in order, they're not the kinds of problems that kill a show.  I think WWE's last KOTR PPV is a remarkable event that deserves a peek.

1) and 2)
King-of-the-Ring Semi-Finals
*  Chris Jericho v. Rob Van Dam
*  Test v. Brock Lesnar
---Jericho and RVD started things off, and basically stole the show.  I don't mean they just had the best match of the night; They Stole The Show!!!  Too bad one of them had to lose, because both of these guys deserved a Forrest Griffin and Stephen Bonnar UFC treatment.  For about 15+ minutes, both guys just kept delivering false finishes and crisp maneuvers.  I can't think of any reason why someone would dislike this.
---Test and Lesnar put on a match that epitomizes the word ""stiff"".  Seriously, when they delivered boots and punches and slams, I cringed a couple times.  Lesnar and Test deserved their critics from their later WWE careers, but in 2002, they were (physically) at the top of their game.  Not nearly as good as the opener, but that was a Match-of-the-Year candidate.  Jericho and RVD were a tough act to follow, but Test and Lesnar held their own.
""8.5 / 10"" for Jericho/RVD
""7.0 / 10"" for Test/Lesnar

3) Cruiserweight Championship
Jamie Noble v. The Hurricane (champion)
---This belt has been shelved because of lack of talent, interst, and/or exposure.  But back in 2002, this division was just as hot as any other.  Noble and Hurricane pulled off some crazy high-risk moves that no human being should ever attempt.  Plus, for guys their size, Helms and Noble are as tough as they come.  A very strong showing between two underrated performers.
""7.5 / 10""

4) Eddie Guerrero v. Ric Flair
---Most WWE fans who know their history will say something like this, ""This should've been Austin should've faced Guerrero, but he quit, so Flair was good enough.""  A little condescending, but those people are right.  Nature Boy was still doing some strong in-ring work back then, and Latino Heat was pretty much always great.  These two meshed well together, utilizing slower mat-wrestling that didn't bore too much.  The match was a little long (20 minutes, I think), but a good show nonetheless.
""7.0 / 10""

5) Women's Championship
Molly Holly v. Trish Stratus (champion)
---Talk about a forgotten ladies' gem.  These two women showcased a remarkable contest that makes me wonder why they didn't get a longer PPV program.  When a crowd shows even a mild interest in a Divas wrestling match, you know it's something special.  This wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread, but if you miss solid action from the ladies' division, I think this will be worth a look.
""7.0 / 10""

***At this point, KING OF THE RING 2002 starts to fall apart.  It's not unwatchable, but the final three matches should've been as strong as the first two hours.***

6) Kurt Angle v. Hollywood Hulk Hogan
---First off, Angle's headgear wig was awesome!  Anyway, how's the match?  If you're a Hogan fan, nothing I say will change your mind.  But if you're as cynical as me, and think Hogan was an overrated phenomenon, I still think you'll get into this.  After facing The Rock at WRESTLEMANIA X-8, this was probably Hogan's greatest match during his 2002 WWE run.  I personally don't think this was a great match.  It might've been because I couldn't stomach how Hogan could keep up with master technician like Kurt Angle,  The match itself was pretty decent, but the finish is excellent.  The ending was truly one of Angle's (and Hogan's) finest moments.
""6.0 / 10""

7) King-of-the-Ring Finals
Rob Van Dam v. Brock Lesnar
---RVD and Lesnar went full-force to win both the KOTR crown, and the SUMMERSLAM title shot.  RVD's stick-and-move tactics against Lesnar's fearsome power was an awesome mix.  The only problem - and it's a BIG problem - was that the Finals was shorter than either Semi-Final contest.  Why, oh why, oh f***ing why did WWE do this?!  These two had a classic the next month at VENGEANCE, but why did we only get 8 minutes for a Tournament final?  Very solid physicality, but a ridiculous time length.
""6.0 / 10""

8) Undisputed WWE Championship
Triple H v. The Undertaker (champion)
---Easily the worst match on the card, I'm sorry to say.  I think HHH had some sort of elbow injury, which prevented him from using his extensive wrestling library.  After a while, I started watching Taker try to protect HHH's falls, rather than pay attention to the storytelling.  The Rock made a guest appearance as color commentator (which WWE promoted weeks before the PPV broadcast).  I gotta give both men a ton of credit for delivering the advertised main event, because I certainly can't do what they did.  I also give credit to the crowd, who were generous with the pacing, and really got into the last few minutes.  But I believe this main event put a firm nail in the PPV's coffin.
""4.5 / 10""

PPV RECAP and DVD EXTRAS
---The PPV had an excellent first two hours, but slowly tan out of gas during its third act.  But there's something here for any kind of wrestling fan.  A technical masterpiece, a stiff big-man showdown, one of Flair's greatest matches from his later career, a Divas ""wrestling match"", and strong Cruiserweight.  The last three matches don't deliver...well, Hogan/Angle might've just not been my cup of tea.

Another perk of this DVD, however, is the Extras.  WWE usually put a strong effort with their 1999-2003 PPV DVDs, and this time it really shows.  First, we get a few PPV commercials, in which everyone from ""the Queen of the Ring"" to a pharoah auditions for a WWE job.  I think TOUGH ENOUGH was in the middle of its second season at the time.  Overall, it's amusing stuff, which comes with a brief making-of featurette.

The real bonus is where you get to watch the last few minutes of EVERY Tournament match from this 2002 King-of-the-Ring Tournament.  Sure, I would've liked to see the complete matches, but you still a get good look at how strong WWE's talent was back then.  It's interesting seeing the Dudleys being on spearate shows, and the New World Order's brief return.

I highly recommend the KING OF THE RING 2002 DVD.  If you just wanna see the Jericho/RVD classic, pick up Rob Van Dam's ONE OF A KIND DVD.  That, too, is an excellent purchase.  But I think this PPV is much better than the trainwreck most have made it out to be.",1213747200,2,6434,4.670525378450579
