8668348,4,B00LVML3AM,"What I like about Korean drama is that there is always decency. Love relationship
Is shown with affection and caring rather than sex and necking. Being an Asian, not Korean, I can relate to family relationship where parents choose their children's future spouse and are very strict and rigid about it. And there is always that class culture. The story also keeps you guessing what happens next and thus you want to go on the next episode and so on. The actors are good and entertaining. After the movie ends, you want to purchase another one to watch.",1447459200,,551,4.63265306122449
8668349,4,B00LVML3AM,"A delightful romantic comedy/drama with a fun bit of fantasy. As usual in Korean TV shows, it follows the theme of the rich young man (CEO of a department store chain) with nasty mother who is trying to arrange a marriage, his sidekick in his musician cousin. There is the poor young orphan woman who this time is a stunt woman, she shares an apt with another young woman, works with a group of stuntmen and is not beautiful. It is slow in a few places but on the second watching you don't notice it. The fantasy is the main 2 characters keep magically exchanging bodies and getting each other in trouble - very funny.",1447027200,,618,4.3826086956521735
