8706566,5,B00UGQ5V7U,"This is one of my favorite movies EVER. Its filled with little details what show the people making it cared a lot and had tons of fun creating this masterpiece. UHF is very funny and you always find something new you didn't see before on re-watch. My family and I quote it all the time.
While fashion and technology in it this film don't age well, Weird-Al makes it timeless. Give it a shot if you're a fan of Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Blazing Saddles, or just a fan of Weird-Al himself!",1525910400,,496,4.231578947368421
