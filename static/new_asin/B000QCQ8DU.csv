2835157,4,B000QCQ8DU,Lumber holding widow partners with returned war veteran son of lumber owner and gambler and her roommate to cut enough lumber in 60 days to pay off the loan before the holding is taken over.  This was a very good movie and showed old lumber practices of hand sawing trees and using the river to get them to the mill and using horses.  Also did use an airplane too.  Nostalgic and good characters.  Nothing objectionable.,1401062400,,420,4.56

2835159,3,B000QCQ8DU,"A strong troupe enjoying themselves make the film seem better than it is, but even Sheldon Leonard, Richard Arlen, Dick Purcell, June Havoc and Mary Beth Hughes can't overcome the speed with which the picture was produced. Nevertheless, if you are in the mood for good company and can overlook the surroundings, routine script and below average transfer, Timber Queen provides plenty of charm.",1356480000,3,393,5.15625
