2089452,2,B0002F6BFQ,"This movie is really weird! I was dissapointed, but at the same time i've seen worse. I have never watched it again, nor has my girlfriend who actually fell asleep while we were watching it. Also she can't watch a lesbian movie if she doesn't think at least one of the girls are hot, and she didn't think any of them were. It's kind of slow moving with not a whole lot of dialogue. It ends strange and after it's over you are wondering why the hell you wasted 2 hours watching this. The shower scene is kind of hot though, although from the reviews I expected better! I wouldn't watch,not buy this movie again, and my girlfriend wasn't even phased by finding out what she missed in the movie.",1130025600,6,692,4.3307692307692305
2089453,3,B0002F6BFQ,"This video was neither great nor awful.  I kind of liked the sub/dom element of the two women involved, having their affair under the noses of their lesbian life partners.  But it wasn't so great that I would heartedly recommend it.  I wouldn't mind seeing further efforts by these actresses and producers with a little more eroticism thrown in.",1112227200,3,345,4.813559322033898
2089454,1,B0002F6BFQ,"This movie is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My apologies to the filmmakers. I applaud any attempt. However, imagine every horrible stereotype about lesbians, then multipy them by 10. One of the lead women had an insane look on her face the entire movie for no apparent reason. The story..bad. Acting...not so good. This movie was truly Inescapable.",1102896000,15,367,4.75
2089455,2,B0002F6BFQ,"I bought this movie based on the first review and because I liked Helen Lesnick's previous movie ""A Family Affair."" I was very disappointed with ""Inescabable."" I have to admit that the sex scenes were great, but that really doesn't make up for the poor acting and an even worse story. Try to rent it before you decide to buy it.",1094774400,18,328,4.39344262295082
2089456,4,B0002F6BFQ,"This was something portrayed as erotic and that it was.  Two old friends meet, and their partners develop an attraction for one another. This could have be really so much better if the soundtrack was more than one song, but, hey, it wasn't made for the music now was it. All in all, Chloe was hot, and the shower scene is great!!! You'll want to buy this one!",1091923200,11,359,4.279411764705882
8027536,5,B0002F6BFQ,"So what if the acting wasn't quit Oscar material, the movie itself was good knowing it had good sex scenes. I thought how exciting it was the see two women have an affair, without even getting caught. It's even more appealing that one time they almost did get caught.

I really hope the price on this movie really goes down, cause I would love to order it.",1457395200,,356,4.313432835820896
8027537,5,B0002F6BFQ,"Why do movies like this goes out of print? Glad I have this now on dvd.
The love scenes are amazing.",1433980800,,100,3.8095238095238093
8027538,5,B0002F6BFQ,I had seen parts of it and I wanted a copy for myself. I enjoyed it--- that's it.,1433894400,,81,3.5555555555555554
8027539,5,B0002F6BFQ,"A really great movie about two people who fall in love!!  If you like this type of movie, BUY IT!!!!!",1417910400,,101,4.05
8027540,3,B0002F6BFQ,"The Love scenes could have been better, great concept. The first one in the kitchen was the best however it was not necessary to have them go that far specially since they were ""snicking around"". Nice bodies on the actresses, could have been a bit more erotic.",1412467200,,260,4.553191489361702
8027541,5,B0002F6BFQ,"OMG!  I've been hunting for this movie ever since I saw it on hulu plus! or was it netflix?  Anyway, wow! is all I can say.  The sex scenes are ""To die for!""  The acting isn't so hot, but the women are! and, yes, this is written from a lesbian point of view.  It is NOT a don't worry fellow lesbos ""man lesbian fantasy thing""",1379203200,,325,3.9384615384615387
8027542,5,B0002F6BFQ,"If Al Bundy made a Lesbian movie this would be it: lots of random sex scenes with little dialogue.

That said, the scenes are taseful and well shot. Nothing too over the top and everything is well crafted around the love making. For example the shower scene was one of the hotest scenes in the movie and Jessie is fully clothed in it. So it was more than just about making a sex scene it was creating a moment of genuine spontaneous lust and love.

I'm surprised this move is 81 minutes long because there is literally about 10 minutes of dialogue, 5 minutes of story and 2 minutes of plot. However the movie does have some tension scenes where you wonder when and if they will get caught. Also there is a journey of Chloe and Jess that you become invested in during the movie and it commits any avid watcher to seeing it thru to the final minute. Nothing edge of your seat or of the heavy emotional drama here, just red hot fun with consequences.

Also, like many other Lesbian dramas, the movie doesn't pretend to be more than it is or promise anything more than it delivers so I had to give it 5 stars.

I like the guy that is selling his used DVD copy of this movie on Amazon for $129. Hilarious considering you can easily and legally rent it or watch it for free anywhere on the internet! I won't even recommend buying the DVD. This is a watch it one time and forget about it type film.",1320278400,2,1391,4.2377358490566035
8027543,5,B0002F6BFQ,"The disc You sent me is technically and qualitatively perfect! Even delivery has been within the terms. Yet the lack of optional sub-titles, at least in english, in the menu at the beginning of dvd hasn't surely been helpful in the oral comprehension of dialogues during all the film. In fact English unfortunately isn't my first language! Bye!!",1240790400,,345,4.9655172413793105
8027544,3,B0002F6BFQ,"Ok, so the acting's not so hot- but the actresses are.  I like the kitchen scene.  Stereotypical- perhaps.  But you can't say it doesn't happen.  Or that you don't want it to happen (to someone else while you watch!).",1228262400,,217,4.487179487179487
8027545,1,B0002F6BFQ,"I saw this at a film festival and it was truly, truly, awful.  The lighting was dim-to-none.  The acting was horrifying.  The story was blech.  Interminable.  Stay away!",1134864000,6,169,4.892857142857143
