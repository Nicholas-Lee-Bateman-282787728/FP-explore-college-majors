2768489,4,B000NDI4TS,"I have read that ""Sweet Rosie O'Grady"" and ""Mother Wore Tights"" were Miss Grable's favorite movies of all the films that she starred in. I am not sure if that means she thought they were her ""best"" movies, or easy to film, or perhaps just personal favorites. Nevertheless, I don't think this movie is as enjoyable as ""Mother Wore Tights"" or several other Grable musicals. I am a  Betty Grable fan, and this film was a big success, but I prefer her films with other male co-stars.

This is a well-executed period musical (costumes, sets, songs, etc)built around a typical backstage plot. Sweet Rosie O'Grady is a saloon singer from the US who has managed to achieve theatrical success in London under another name. She returns to the US as a famous London stage success, but her true identity is discovered by a newpaper reporter, Rober Young. The two do battle as Sweet Rosie tries to conceal her identity and the reporter tries to get a scoop for his paper.... and eventually this turns into romance.

Although this film is entertaining and Betty Grable looks and sounds great, the pairing with Robert Young lacks chemistry. Miss Grable was often partnered with leads who had limited singing or dancing abilities like Mr. Young, but usually they had romantic comedy credentials that created some on-screen chemistry. Think of Don Ameche in ""Down Argentine Way"" and ""Moon over Miami"". (Interesting that outside of the films with Dan Dailey and Dick Haymes, Miss Grable never had male costars who were primarily singers or dancers)

But Robert Young was a strange choice to partner with Miss Grable in this or any musical. It was  the height of WW2 and many of the top actors were in the service, and that probably had a lot to do with the pairing; but it is not a surprise that they were never paired together again. It is not a ""bad"" performance by Robert Young, it just feels flat and ""by the numbers"".

A few notes about this movie: Miss Grable does a bathtub singing scene which was somwhat risque for the time. And Miss Grable's famous wartime pinup photo came from a publicity session done for this film. Finally, due to the period when the events take place (late 19th century), the only significant dance number is a waltz with Hermes Pan. There is some light tap sprinkled into a musical number, but the dance is very incidental to the music in that scene. So if you enjoy seeing Miss Grable in dance routines like I do, this is not the best movie for that.

Sweet Rosie O'Grady is a great example of the big-budget Fox musicals of the 1940s: Betty Grable, technicolor, lavish sets, light comedy. If you like musicals it won't disappoint you.",1288396800,5,2651,4.663811563169165
2768490,5,B000NDI4TS,"I love Betty Grable musicals and remember seeing several in re-releaes in early childhood with my parents, sometimes twice.  (She was my father's favorite actress). I loved the costumes, singing, and dancing and have bought or recorded every film available.  I remember asking for and being given Betty Grable paper dolls and coloring books and relished learning to tap dance because of her. Since buying Vol. 1, I've been awaiting a Vol. 2.  Why Alice Faye, who I don't remember but whose musicals I now own and do enjoy, and not Betty Grable?",1237593600,15,544,4.827956989247312
2768491,5,B000NDI4TS,"I can't wait for this to come out on DVD.  Betty Grable has been my very favorite since the early 40s when I, as a kid, saw every movie she made, I think (movie $.10 + .02 luxury tax).  I knew all the words to her songs and much of her dance routines.  Rosie O'Grady was top of my list, followed by Coney Island and Springtime in the Rockies.  It is so exciting to see the movies being offered now.",1232064000,6,398,3.9375
2768492,5,B000NDI4TS,"Betty Grable once said that this was one of her two favorite musicals to make.  (The other was Mother Wore Tights (1947), which also deserves to be released on DVD).  Sweet Rosie O'Grady has a sweet story, lovely costumes, glamorous Technicolor and beautiful songs.  Add to that, excellent support from Robert (Father Knows Best) Young, Adolphe Menjou, Reginald Gardiner, and Virginia Grey.  But the real/reel reason to watch is that sweet, lovely, glamorous, beautiful star with the million dollar legs---Betty Grable!  Much more talented than the critics gave her credit for, Grable can charm the pants off the Police Gazette (where Young and Menjou hang their hats).  And when she cuddles up in a bubble bath and sings that scrumptious song, ""My Heart Tells Me,"" your heart is going to melt.  This musical has been released by Fox Cinema Archives on MOD DVD-R and the Technicolor print is terrific.  (By the way, the photo is from Wabash Avenue (1950), another Grable musical that's available on DVD-R from Fox Cinema Archives.)",1222387200,26,1031,5.023529411764706

2768494,4,B000NDI4TS,"There was only 1 Betty Grable. She enjoys her work and it shows in her films. Not only can she sing & dance
great figure, but can also act. She entertains.",1370736000,,155,4.032258064516129

2768498,5,B000NDI4TS,"I was six-years-old in July 1943 and, even then, a big Betty Grable fan.  One of the most popular stars of the 1940's & 50's (she holds the record for being the only female star on Motion Picture Herald's ""Most Popular Stars List"" ten years in a row).  There was no one like her & never will be.  She was beautiful, glamorus, breathtaking in Technicolor, had a radiant smile, great complexion, good sense-of-humor & fine singing voice (witness Betty in a bubble bath singing ""My Heart Tells Me""). She could dance with the best-of-them & proves it with Hermes Pan (Fred Astaire's dance assistant) whirling to ""The Wishing Waltz"".  Betty was a huge star and 20th Century-Fox knew it.  Movie exhibitors were clamoring for MORE Betty Grable films. The GI's loved her ""over-the-shoulder"" bathing suit photo electing her the most popular ""Pin Up Girl"" of WWII.  ""Coney Island"" (her other release that year) also hit the jackpot. The two pictures delivered 8-million-dollars in ticket sales (an enormous amount of money since ticket prices were between 25 & 45-cents) giving Fox two of 1943's biggest money makers.  This DVD is NOT Technicolor.  But it's a good print and worth the price.  Anyone who loves Betty Grable , or is simply curious, WATCH ""Sweet Rosie O'Grady"" and ""Coney Island"" (when it becomes available).  You won't be disappointed.",1356739200,2,1340,4.915555555555556
2768499,4,B000NDI4TS,"Glad this movie finally came out in dvd.  The dvd has the movie in good quality.  Too bad this movie hasn't been colorized, cause it would be wonderful with color.",1351900800,,163,4.4
2768500,5,B000NDI4TS,"We Betty Grable fans have been waiting FOREVER for Fox to finally release more of her films. Sweet Rosie O'Grady have never been made available on VHS and this is the first DVD release. This DVD has no:
1. chapters (you have to use the fast forward button)
2. interesting artwork
3. extras (like a trailer) of any type

In it's favor - Betty! Finally! I've had a bad taped - from- TV VHS version of this film for years that I finally can give to the Salvation Army.
Okay, 20th Century Fox - time to get rolling on releasing more Betty Grable films. Just don't make the packaging so chintzy. Betty made a lot of money for you and she deserves better.",1350086400,4,649,4.276422764227642
2768501,4,B000NDI4TS,"Betty Grable the woman with a Million Dollar Legs was an amazing performer. She could sing act and boy could she dance. She had a wholesomeness about her that just kept you glue to her every move.....

Now, with that said, I just want to say I am by no means a critic. I rate films for the intended purpose, ""entertainment"". In my opinion, a movie is created to tell a story, sort of like a visual book. I do not judge a movie because the book version was better or an actor/actress is not on my favorite list, I judge the story for the entertainment and this film ""Sweet Rosie O'Grady"" was full of entertainment.

Sweet Rosie O'Grady was a burlesque queen who got a break at stardom in the real theatre. To hide her identity she changes her name only to be found out. The film is funny and sweet. Its wholesome and fun and Betty Grable is just amazing. Considered to be one of Betty Grables favorite films to make, it is worth watching. You will find yourself watching it more then once.

I would love to see more of her films released on DVD as this is one performer who had it all.......

To the younger generations out there. Tid Bit: Betty Grables legs were truly insured through Lloyds of London for a Million Dollars each back in the 1930's. Today that would in the ball park of $50 million each. This woman could move and her legs were well shaped to perfection!",1345766400,6,1370,4.319066147859922
2768502,5,B000NDI4TS,"Delightful entertainment with Betty Grable at her sparkling best.  She has probably never been more beautiful than when singing My Heart Tells Me in the bathtub.  The visual quality of this DVD is excellent, as are all Grable's musical numbers. It was ideal viewing for bringing a bit of sunstine into a cold southern hemisphere winter's day.",1344988800,5,342,4.982456140350878
2768503,5,B000NDI4TS,"Sweet Rosie O'Grady has a script that can be a bit off-putting
as the stars tell each other one lie after another, but it looks
beautiful and the musical numbers are wonderful. Who cares
about the script when Betty Grable is on screen? Even though
it's a bit pricy, if you love Betty Grable, it's worth every dollar.
There are no extras, but I am happy to add this Technicolor musical
to my collection.
Robert Young, Adolphe Menjou, Reginald Gardiner and Virginia Grey
round out the able cast. There are so many great Betty Grable movies
not yet released on DVD such as Tin Pan Alley (with Alice Faye),
Song Of The Islands, Footlight Serenade, Coney Island and the re-make,
Wabash Avenue, Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe, Springtime In The Rockies
(the only movie with Carmen Miranda not on DVD), Mother Wore Tights
and more. With the release of Sweet Rosie O'Grady, there's is
renewed hope that more of her films will follow. Hooray!",1343779200,6,933,4.730061349693251

It was of scheming actions to put tricks over on each other see who might win. In the end it was the right win.
