8349858,5,B0023S49QI,"Another fantastic set of Taggart crime dramas.  Fell in love with the show when I lived in Edinburgh.  Some may find the Scottish accents hard to understand, but once you get used to them, they're fabulous.  Mark McManus is superb, as always.",1439769600,,242,4.714285714285714

8349861,4,B0023S49QI,"This is volume 9 of the original series.
The proper sequence to view these sets is:
1) KILLER set
2) DEATH CALL set
3) COLD BLOOD set
4) ROOT OF EVIL set
5) EVIL EYE set
6) VIOLENT DELIGHTS set
7) THE HIT MAN set
8) RING OF DECEIT set
9) DEATH WITHOUT DISHONOUR set
10) HELLFIRE set
11) PRAYER FOR THE DEAD set (the last Jim Taggart episode)

This set from ""series 9"" contains extended length episodes running well over 2 hours. Unfortunately this longer length tends to drag some of the episodes down.
""GINGERBREAD"" 2 hours & 7 minutes (1993) - This is a story you would expect to see in MIDSOMER MURDERS, full of quirky characters, gingerbread houses & fairytell like settings. This would have been a wonderful episode at 90 minutes, but the added 37 minutes is padded out with personal love relationships of the inspectors that bring the detective work to a halt.
""DEATH WITHOUT DISHONOUR"" 2 hours & 9 minutes (1993) - It's cab wars & Taggart has to protect a witness of a trile where a barrister turns up dead.  Again, a good 90 minute episode is stretched out another 39 minutes, this time with musical interludes.
""INSTRUMENT OF JUSTICE"" 2 hours & 7 minutes (1993) - Finally a complex story worthy of the extended run time. Not a minute is wasted. A witness coming to testify at a trial disappears and the barristers lives are in danger. This episode actually starts ""series 10"" and introduced Taggart's new boss DCS Ellen Gorden.

This set also includes cast Bio's, strangely omitting Blyth Duff",1307923200,3,1502,4.5762081784386615
8349862,5,B0023S49QI,"Set in Glasgow, Harriet Buchan plays the wheel-chair bound wife of the detective, Taggart.  I met her recently with Wildquest, swimming with wild dolphins in Bimini and couldn't remember where I had seen her, until I returned home and Googled her name.  Great acting!",1259280000,,267,5.045454545454546
