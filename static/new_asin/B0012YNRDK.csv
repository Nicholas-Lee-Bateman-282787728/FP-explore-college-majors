8326046,4,B0012YNRDK,"I just got back from a 38 day adventure to Alaska and back on a 2007 Harley Softail Custom. I had plan on riding the Haul road but had starter problems so my plan changed.  After seeing Gary's video I am glad the I ""missed"" it.  He should have had more content on what to take and what not to take and about the road construction.  I ran into about 60 mile of road construction and lots of rain on the Alaska Highway but got used to it.  It actually added to the adventure. Overall it was a nice video to watch.  My wife and I recognized several places where we stopped on our trip including the place where we picked up a deck screw in the rear tire.  I would have like to see his trip on the way back down the Dalton Highway.",1439769600,,727,3.9793103448275864

8326048,3,B0012YNRDK,"I ride a Goldwing, and have occasionally thought about obtaining and riding something more appropriate (by this I mean lighter & more off-road capable) to Alaska. I've read some & watched some videos about this, and this one caught my eye as a possible source of information. I was generally disappointed with it, mainly because there was almost no real ""hard"" information - for example, nothing about the bike/sidecar he rode, other than a comment about being able to engage the sidecar wheel in the soft sand. I was able to figure out that he was riding a Ural, but a lot of people would have had no idea.
There was no discussion about equipment, camping gear (if any) food, clothing - nothing! If you are going to do a video like this,I would think you would realize how many people would be interested in how you did it, and what you used.
The video production quality was typical amateur ""one man band"". It was obvious that a minimal amount of equipment was used, and that's not bad, but if more actual information had been included, rather than extended scenes of riding on gravel roads with music playing, I think that the video would have been more enjoyable and usable. Gary is obviously one tough traveler, as I would have found it hard to do most of what he did with a smile, so no knocks of his accomplishment (especially the dip in the Arctic!), but as I said, more information about the equipment and things seen along the way would have been appreciated.",1310774400,2,1469,4.568181818181818
8326049,5,B0012YNRDK,"Gary Smith has given us an inspiring video account of his trip from Oregon through BC and the Yukon to Alaska, and north to Prudhoe Bay including great footage on the Haul Road.  He travels solo in a Ural sidecar rig, with companions riding 2 up on a KLR650.  The photography is by Gary, so it's not Hollywood but it's definitely the real thing and it's good.  In addition to great road footage, Gary includes entertaining interviews with many of the folks he meets along the way.  The soundtrack includes a good variety of excellent blues, too.  I've watched my copy a number of times, and I like it a lot.  Buy it -- you won't be disappointed.",1291507200,,645,4.423728813559322
