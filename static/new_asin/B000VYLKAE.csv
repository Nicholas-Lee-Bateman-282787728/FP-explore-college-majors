Yeah, the Austin concert looks cool because of all the people in the park, but it's not the best performance. Still, this is an amazing value for your money and this band has some of the best live production ever. Get yourself a decent system and enjoy this. It's amazing what a difference decent speakers make compared to regular old tv speakers. These shows would make great live albums (they probably are available as live audio, but I haven't bothered to look into it). Definitely worth your time and money. Stones rock.",1381449600,,598,4.650943396226415
8220548,5,B000VYLKAE,"This dvd actually contains 2 full concerts, with few repeated songs.  It contains the best of the Rolling Stones Repertoir and is likw being at the concert.  Mick, of course if amazing, and the rest of the group just as much.  One of my favorite groups and now a favorite concert video.",1346976000,2,286,4.461538461538462
8220549,5,B000VYLKAE,"I love this box set.  This might not be The Stones in their prime, but they still know how to put on a show, and the performances on The Biggest Bang are about all you could hope for from a rock concert.  There are lots of bonus features such as mini documentaries about a couple of the concerts, a documentary about the entire Bigger Bang Tour, and more.  My only problem is that this will not work well, or sometimes at all, on my computer.  When I play it on my home theater system it works fine, but when I tried to watch it on either of my computers it's very jumpy, the menus don't work correctly, or sometimes the media player gets hung up and I have to CTRL - ALT -Delete to get out of it.  Disc 4 isn't even recognized as a DVD by one of my computers, on the other one it will play but the picture is shrunk down to about 1/4 size.  I'm guessing it might be some sort of copy protection.  If it happened on one computer I might think it was just a problem with the computer, but when it won't work on two different computers with different media players on them it has to be the DVD's.  If you are just going to watch this on a standard DVD player there shouldn't be any problem though.",1294444800,2,1195,4.05531914893617
8220550,5,B000VYLKAE,"I enjoy the Stones and ANY DVD of them is worth owing and watching. For 2007, the 5.1 audio is good but not as good as compared to the 2009 digital remaster of ""Live at the Max""). The filming was great, high quality, The Stones as usual played great engergetic shows, no complaints.  I just wish using 6 speakers they would have re-mixed the songs for better separation, it sounds almost like a straight to video sound board recording, but is still good to listen too.",1281398400,2,468,4.441860465116279
