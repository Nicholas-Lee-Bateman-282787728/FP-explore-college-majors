Blaze Bayley knocks it out of the park with this live DVD release, a valuable addition to his already impressive body of work that fully measures up to his well established high standards.  As we have come to expect from our man Blaze, he holds nothing back here, giving his fans everything he's got.  Nobody ROCKS harder than Blaze!!  He is the very definition and embodiment of Heavy Metal music.

The important thing to know about this DVD is that it appears to run continuously, with little if any noticeable edits.  All of Blaze's song introductions, comments, etc. look to be intact, thus preserving the all important 'live' feel and ambience of the show.  Well done!!

One unusual aspect of this concert is that Blaze's band here is a three piece, with only one guitar instead of the usual two.  I admit I was apprehensive about this decision, but the guitar player (Chris Appleton) is very skilled, and although the sound is of course not as full as two guitars would be, on most of the songs he pulls it off quite nicely.  Even on something as complex as ""Silicon Messiah"" or ""The Clansman"", he does a convincing job (and check out that blistering 12 minute version of ""Tough As Steel"", a song from his Wolfsbane days and quite appropriate here since Wolfsbane was also a three piece with only one guitar player).  This show provides an interesting counterpoint to Blaze's previous live works, all of which feature two guitars.  So while I would not want to see Blaze permanently discard the twin guitar lineup, in this one case it provides an interesting contrast.

This show also provides a different vibe to the previous live DVDs in the way the sound is mixed.  The crowd, though still present, is more muted and 'in the background' of the mix.  Some listeners will prefer this since you can hear the music better, though the 'live' purists (which I tend to be) might find it a bit too clean, without the 'warts and all' rawness of, for example his ""Alive In Poland"" show.  Still, it is done here in a manner that is competent and professional, so I would not say one is necessarily better than the other, just a matter of personal preference.  And again, the contrast with Blaze's previous live releases is interesting.

 As you can see from the details below, Blaze delivers a big bang for the buck here.  Just the concert itself runs 2 hours and 10 minutes (that's a LONG show).  Total DVD running time is 183 minutes.  This is one reason why his fans think so highly of him: because he truly cares about us and always strives to do the best he can and give us maximum value for our money.  In a time when it seems that human failings are everywhere, Blaze remains a man of honor and integrity, really just a great, down to earth guy (not to mention a magnificently gifted and talented performer).

Behind the Scenes Photos

There is also a 5:44 video excerpt during the concert end credits that features Blaze discussing the formulation of the set list for the show.

My source for this review is the Limited Edition pre-order version of this title (limited to 500 copies), which came in an oversized tin case with a numbered certificate (I got #123) signed by Blaze, a signed photo of Blaze, signed laminated 'backstage pass', cloth patch, and 26 page Limited Edition booklet which features the names of the 500 purchasers printed in the booklet, and also includes Blaze's extensive diary notes from the tour, photos, credits, etc.  So I don't exactly know what all comes with this Regular edition as shown on Amazon.  I presume the booklet is substantially the same (except perhaps for the printed names of the purchasers of the Limited Edition), and I take it for granted that the contents of the DVD is identical in both versions (those who purchased the Limited Edition also got our names in the end credits of the DVD).

Thanks again to Blaze for an all around great DVD release!!",1413936000,2,4914,4.757969303423849
