8619110,4,B00FX9YV12,"I'm giving the actual drama itself a four star, because its a fun drama to watch. However, the English Subtitles are so inaccurate, it spoils the drama. The acting is a little....meh, but in the case Hiroshi Abe's acting, his character makes this series much more fun to watch.

Actual cases aren't too hard to solve whilst watching, but don't expect any brain twisting cases.",1439078400,,376,4.7846153846153845
