8028916,4,B0002LHP8M,"I teach a watercolor class about twice a year, and one of the favorite lessons is on how to use kosher salt and table salt to liven up a dull background or to add exciting texture to a painting.

I don't usually have time in a class to go over all the aspects of using salt, and this video covers many topics, such as using opaque paint versus transparent, which salt does what (star-like textures from kosher flakes, fine sand-like texture with table salt.) Artist Judy Morris also gives some secret tips that go against the usual advice, such as glazing with opaque paint (generally, you put layers of transparent paint over opaque to tone the color.)

I tried some of her techniques and learned quite a few new things--one trick was so easy, I wondered why I hadn't learned it before. You let your salt on your paper dry, and then scrape it off to smoothness with an expired credit card. The perfect tool!

This video is about an hour or so, and the required materials are large round brushes such as a 10 and a 12, a large wash brush, watercolor paint in Quinacridones Gold, Coral, & Burnt Sienna, Aureolin (I would use another paint like Nickel Azo Yellow, as aureolin tends to darken), Cobalt Teal, Ultramarine Violet, Carbazole Violet, Burnt Sienna, Indian Red, Cerulean Blue, French Ultramarine, Yello ochre, Cadmium Yellow, Cobalt Blue, Winsor (Pyrrol or Napthol) Red, ""Permanent"" Alizarin (Quinacridone Violet is my choice.) In other words, an extended modern palette.

If you don't know this technique yet for watercolor, it's very useful. I've even made insect-chewed leaves using salt to push the paint in a network effect, and I've used it for snow flying, brickwork, and much more. Try it!",1257033600,2,1704,4.766101694915254
