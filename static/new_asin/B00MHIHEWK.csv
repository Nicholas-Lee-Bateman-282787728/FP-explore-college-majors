8672334,4,B00MHIHEWK,"just saw this on You tube (they have taken it down already) it was pretty good if you are into Hooligan and Spoof movies. theres parts of a few different movies in this that make it good if you've seen them, they spoof Good fellas, Green street Hooligans, The Foot Ball Factory, Rise of the foot solder and The Firm.. amongst others It had its funny moments, but mostly it was just one of those goofy movies that you don't need to stay focused 100% to watch and get. A good flick to have on when you are doing something else, and not paying full attention to the TV.",1430179200,,566,4.201834862385321
