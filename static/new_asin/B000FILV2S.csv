2568001,3,B000FILV2S,"Sadly, this was not as good as the first two which rocked. I love the blue collar comedy movies, but this one just wasn't that funny. Don't get me wrong, each of the boys have their moments. Just as a whole, I don't think anything will top the second one. Granted, I will probably still buy it, but you may be better off buy ""you can't fix stupid"" as that was absolutley hysterical.",1149552000,7,382,4.2465753424657535
2568002,5,B000FILV2S,"What I love about these Blue Collar DVD's is they feature some of the best sets these guys have, but they leave you wanting more and that leads to yet another Blue Collar DVD with, get this, different material and that is really worth the purchase.  This is the third installment and its just as impressive as the previous two.  Bill Engvall (one of the funniest men alive) starts things off, and as he does best he takes jabs as family life since above all else Bill is a family man.  One of the funniest jokes has to do though with his first massage and his reaction to it...great laughs.  Ron White is up next, and as he does best he takes jabs at life with booze and loose women, except now that he's a married man the loose women part has been narrowed down to one woman.  His set though is still funny especially his take on the movie 'Grizzly Man' although he spoiled the ending!  Jeff Foxworthy is on top of his game, although if you ask me he's not as good as his open acts, and quite frankly neither is Larry, although Larry can succeed in getting a laugh out of you for just about anything (his stand up routine in full is histerical!)  The great thing about these Blue Collar DVD's is that each of the four men bring something different to the table, their comedy is all unique that it doesn't feel your hearing the same recycled jokes over and over and each has such different delivery everything feels fresh, from Bills almost girlish expressions to Larry's 'Git-er-Done' every line is bound to force a smile.  If you own the first two then this is a must have, and even if your new to the phenominon that is Blue Collar TV this is still a very good start!",1149465600,32,1670,4.313099041533547

2568017,5,B000FILV2S,"I don't care what other reviewers said about this preformance of these four comics, the preformance made me laugh so hard almost fell off my bed plus made my ribs hurt just like from the second one Rides Again.  I found each comic very entertaining and don't believe their preformances suffer at all during their rants.  I am a huge fan of all of them but I have bought couple more Ron White DVD'S from his 2009 preformance Behavior Problems, and 2013 A Little Unporfessional.  Buy all the Blue Collar guys brought it and will make you laugh till you cry, fall out of your seat or bed and keep on laughing until it hurts.  I do agree with other reviewer that well worth the money just for the closing segment, where the wives played a joked on them and didn't tell them about it until it was right in front of their faces, called the photo gallery and Jeff Foxworthy had a the little clicker.  It was old school photo's of all four of them got to buy the DVD to see what I mean funny as hell just for the photo's but the preformance well worth price also.",1457740800,3,1055,4.255

2568056,5,B000FILV2S,"the blue collar comedy tour one for the road is just as funny as the first two. if you are a fan of any of the comics or own the first two then you need to purchase this dvd. the most funny parts of the whole part of the dvd is at the end when they are sitting around at the end trading jokes and when they show photos that their wives gave the producers of the movie and showed them to the crowd and made comments on the photos, the second funny part of the dvd is in the extra section of the dvd when they did a joke on the president. i own all three of the movies and i love watching all three of the movies.",1264636800,,611,3.744186046511628
2568057,5,B000FILV2S,Here are four very funny guys who have nailed it when it comes to their observations on varying aspects of life. Minimal swearing meant this was great viewing with the family.,1264291200,,175,4.67741935483871
2568058,4,B000FILV2S,"We had the first 2 so getting this one was a no brainer.  For the most part we really enjoyed this one but perhaps not as much as the first two shows.  I am not sure if too many of the jokes were similar or if perhaps the whole thing was just played out too long.  Do not get me wrong as it was funny but just not as great as the first two.

That said my one big grip with this one was it was dirty compared to the others.  Especially Ron White who goes a bit too far in my opinion for what we consider a more family oriented show.  While the other shows skirt around some sexual topics in a tactful yet respectful way, this one just seemed to bluntly cross the line many times.  Some people enjoy that humor and to an extent we do as well but not at the level that was done in this show, again especially from Ron White.

Overall a good purchase and if you enjoyed the first two you will like this one as well but the magic was fading here which may be one reason we have not seen a fourth.",1254441600,,991,3.871287128712871

2568060,5,B000FILV2S,"This is a great tour that these fantastic stand-up comic do. It's hilarious from start to finish and my particular favorite is Ron White. He is just too funny. I highly recommend this if you enjoy stand-up comedy and like ""redneck"" comedy. This can be enjoyed by rural and city people a like. I am from the Chicago area and I absolutely love this.

2568065,5,B000FILV2S,The DVD is FAR MORE funny then the CD.  When all of them came out it was unbelievable funny.  After watching this DVD I was unable to fall a sleep because I kept thinking thing about parts of this funny parts and kept laughing.  If you have the CD you must buy the DVD because you miss so much that you don't see.  BIG BELLY laughs with all the guys.  DON'T miss the comments these guys make when they show the pictures there wife's sent at the end of the DVD.  It's probably the best part of the DVD.,1178236800,,501,4.01010101010101
2568066,4,B000FILV2S,"Ok so I have to admit I'm not a redneck but I love these guys I bought the first two Blue Comedy Tours from Amazon as i could not get them anywhere else and since them I was compelled to buy more - this dvd was what I was hoping it was going to be as we finally got extras!! Now i know some people bag these guys as white trash and all I got to say to that is at least you can watch this with the kids - unlike some other stand up comedies I have seen like Chris Rock's Bigger and Blacker - which is one of my all time favorites  but there is a lot of swearing at least you can be sure your Mum or Dad can watch it and find it just as funny as you - I give it another Double Top Dogs! I hope they bring out another one - great stuff from:

2568067,4,B000FILV2S,"From the first time I saw these guys on Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie, I instantly thought they were funny.  Bill & Jeff were their usual hilarious selves, Larry was ok.. his voice sounded a little off but Ron, wow... did he even pack on the pounds!  I think all that drinking fattened him up and took away his ability to be funny.

I thought this installment easily was up to the level of the rest of them, and that end bit with the photos was the funniest end bit of all of the shows.  Each of the guys' comedy was right on and had me laughing endlessly.  In this one, all four routines were well spaced and perfectly long enough to be fully satisfied, plus the material seemed very fresh and new. The finale was also absolutely hilarious in seeing old photos of the guys from years before. Some of them were obviously doctored by a computer, but the guys' reactions to them were great. This was an awesome movie, the Blue Collar boys hitting a home run in their last at-bat. Overall, a must buy!",1172361600,,1003,4.3138297872340425

I didn't like Larry much in the other tours but he either got better or I just didn't appreciate him the first two times I saw him. Jeff Foxworthy came in a close second with his fashion tips. Ron White seemed a bit mean this time around and was the low point in the show. I told my husband he was my favorite of the four in the first two ""Blue Collar Tours"" and was disappointed this time. Neither one of us liked him much on this tour.

I liked them sitting together showing photos of themselves when they were young. Being their age, I remember how ugly clothes was back then and I had to snicker at how bad we all looked in the 1970s.

I would have given it 5 stars if Ron White was better.",1155427200,3,789,4.083870967741936

Bill Engvall, Ron White, Larry the Cable Guy, and Jeff Foxworthy return with their all-new, best material for a crowd that is electrified. With their PG-13 humor, they make fun of everyone, especially southern, redneck, America.

Foxworthy delivers a new bit on ""Fashion Tips for Rednecks"". Engvall describes his first massage, Larry pleads with God ""Lord, you know I am only a C student"" and Ron White lets loose on dogs, including his own beloved bulldog.

All four of these stand-up comedians are funny but this particular show just did not live up to the first two in the series.  While the jokes are new, they just weren't as cleverly delivered and just not quite as entertaining.  Like the last two videos, the best part is when all four of them sit down together at the end and crack jokes.  The special features are okay but nothing special.

While I didn't enjoy this video as much as the others, it's still a lot of fun to watch and something you can stick in for a few laughs just about any time.",1152662400,7,772,4.401408450704225

Larry was last and I think he was the best on this tape, but Bill is still my favorite.  I don't get the humor in Ron White, but oh well.
