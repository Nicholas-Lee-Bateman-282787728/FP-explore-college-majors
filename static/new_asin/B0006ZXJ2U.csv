2198381,2,B0006ZXJ2U,"You notice all these other people who review this said it was great because of the scene when they go down into the basement and see all the crazy people? Well, Why don't you ask them what else was so great about this movie besides the beginning of this movie? Its starts off good and interesting, but by the time you get closer to the ending, you soon get to see how this is nothing more than a generic B horror with bad acting and FX. It starts of great. It hooks you in, you thinking ""wow this is cool...and insane asylum"".  I was nodding off about half way into it because it was to slow and boring. By the time I woke back up I was looking at the main characters battling it out (I finally was woke up by something actually happening) and the battle was very stupid. You will see what I mean. the movie loses all its serious atmosphere the further it drags on, its not even close to scary.
  Besides the flawed acting and bad plot, I had a major problem with this movie. Due to the fact it is a B-horror, you tend to either get bad sound or bad picture on a low budget horror movie. In this case it is definitely the sound. The picture is great, but the sound utterly ticked me right off. It is muffled and hard to hear the people talking. So, you crank it up to hear what they are saying, then when some action or ""make you jump"" scene comes it is blaring annoying loud!! Hollywood is doing this with all horror and action movies these days, however, you seem to notice it more on this movie than most. The sounds levels are insanely uneven. You go from extremely muffled mumbling actor talk to wall shaking, earth pound noises in split second. I bet my neighbor heard as much of this movie as I did.
  I gave it an extra star for the asylum sequences and everything that fell outside of the boring moments. Otherwise. It's a stupid movie!",1110844800,,1845,4.215297450424929
2198382,3,B0006ZXJ2U,"Ok there is nothing wrong with the movie, it just didn't play quite the way I had thought judging from other reviews.  I do agree that Session 9 was a lot better and that is the movie I was hoping for, this just did not scare me as much at all.  It is however, worth seeing for the part where they go to the basement level where the truly crazed are, the sets were awesome.  Natasha Leonne was great.",1109289600,,400,4.037974683544304
2198383,4,B0006ZXJ2U,"Set in an unknown region of the US but filmed in Romania (which gives it some extra ""spice"" and atmosphere), ""Madhouse"" is an eerie, frightening little low-budget movie that managed to really scare me.  The quick cut images of ""patients"", weird goings-on, ghosts, etc. only added to the unsettling feeling of this film.  Starring Joshua Leonard (""The Blair Witch Project""), Jordan Ladd (""Cabin Fever"") and the wonderful Lance Henriksen (""Millenium"", ""Aliens""), the basic story is of a med school intern, Clark (Leonard), coming to Cunningham Hall Mental Institute to finish his credits.  The place is borderline Victorian in both decor and treatment of its patients and Clark wants to change all this.  Dr. Franks (Henrikson) wants nothing to do with that and insists patient maintenance is the primary concern.  Clark is introduced to Sara (Ladd) who gives him a tour of the facility, including the basement ""madhouse"" which houses a horrific bunch of inmates.  It's almost like a carnival freakshow there.  Gruesome murders ensue, an inmate, Alice (Natasha Lyonne), is seeing frightening images, Clark keeps seeing a mysterious little boy wandering around and ""meets"" one of the inmates in the ""madhouse"" after the first murder occurs in order to interview him.  To give away more of the plot wouldn't be fair - this movie has it's fair share of grue and scares but it has some weak moments and it's definitely no ""Session 9"" for those of us who LOVE scary movies set in insane asylums.  Perhaps one should watch this movie and just consider it a sort of ""Session 9"" with the patients still there.  Perhaps more, just watch both of them and judge for yourself.  ""Madhouse"" IS a pretty damn good scare-fest!",1109030400,,1708,4.97887323943662
2198384,4,B0006ZXJ2U,"The movie opens with a young psychiatric intern Joshua Leonard coming to a backwoods run down mental hospital to get credit for his doctorate.  Instead of a mental hospital, he finds a real chamber of horrors, especially in the basement, where they keep the ones ""people would rather forget.""

The plot was good, there is a boy/ghost running around the hospital, (too bad they never listed the actor's name in the credits) there are a string of murders, lots of good effects; and most importantly, a great plot twist at the end.  There were also quite a few big name actors, such as Lance Henriksen, who had small roles in favor of the lesser known actors (probably to save money.)

2198386,4,B0006ZXJ2U,"I'm not comparing the two movies, but I give this film credit as it was released long before Shudder Island.  Great atmosphere for an asylum, and the actors do a great job of portraying the cream of the criminally insane.  More mess than Shudder Island, so like I said it's a great movie for the horror fan.

The plot was good building up to the surprise at the end, although I would have like to seen the movie go in a different direction.  That isn't really a negative comment, just my personal opinion.

I enjoyed the characters interactions with each other, and found them all quite likeable.  Good movie overall.",1347494400,,617,4.5636363636363635

He quickly sees that things are not quite right. As he is investigating the strange going-ons he starts to see the ghost of a young boy. He is given conflicting stories. The patients are considered to be very bad off, although some seem very sane.

I loved the visual effects, both in the beginning and later on during the tale. Excellent use of shadows and lighting coupled with a good soundtrack. The acting was good. The plot tells you something is wrong and there must be a twist.

2198388,5,B0006ZXJ2U,"'Madhouse' and 'High Tension' are both two of some of my favorite movies. I love a good movie that has a crazy twist at the end and this is one of them. I like 'Madhouse' on a few different levels because of a few different reasons but it may not necessarily be a good movie for everyone. I like it because it's twisted and dark. The acting is pretty good...right? Lol. I think that I don't notice things bad with movies that I really like haha.

'Madhouse' takes place in a mental institution. It's about this doctor who is working there for his internship and all the other doctors, security and nurses are like crazy...sort of. They abuse the patients and all that kind of stuff. And there is this major twist at the end of the movie which is super amazing! So, I like that it takes place in a mental hospital because, that's like my dream job. It sounds pretty morbid I guess but I would love to work there and I'm actually going to school to be a psychiatric nurse practitioner. And I like that it has a twist at the end and shows just how bad some of these places can be.

Anyways, I think that 'Madhouse' is awesome and you should definitely check it out. Also, if you haven't seen High Tension, I recommend that one too both are amazing and the same type of movie. I'm probably going to review 'High Tension' soon too so watch out for that. For now, watch 'Madhouse' it's pretty sweet!

I have watched a ton of crappy to average bargain bin horror movies but every once in a while you find a gem that somehow got lost in the crowd.  This is one of those movies.  My one complaint is that the alternate ending which is included on the DVD is soooo much better than the ""real"" ending (that I'm sure a bunch of corporate tards made them use so they could leave it open for a sequel).  I always stop the dvd when I know the ending is coming and switch to the alternate ending and pretend the ""real"" ending doesn't exist.

I won't say what the ending is, but the movie sucked me in to where I was enjoying it, but then the ending did not pay off for me, if it had a better ending then I'm sure this movie would have done a bit better then it did, it just really seemed rushed and not done right.

I suppose there is nothing anyone can do about it now, so to take it for what it is, it's ok, much better then some of the other poor horrors I rented when I found this one, but I can't see anyone wanting to keep this movie and watch it again anytime soon, nor highly recommend it to anyone.

Maybe it was the perfectly fantastic Session 9 that kept me from it. I figured that no other movie of it's type could possibly chill me quite as much. With the release of House of Voices recently as well as Boo, I figured hey, why not, I'll try madhouse. This movie is clever, scary and intensely riveting. You never truly know whether there really  is a malevolent force at work possibly possessing a resident of the facility or if it's just some nut in general. There are plenty of suspects and lots of gruesome imagery both imagined and real. The boy ""ghost"" who continues to pop up is sure to raise the hairs on your arm as will the scene at the end when we learn the truth of the patient in that room in the basement. Like The Sixth Sense, clues abound everywhere and you don't really understand that they were clues until the end. Why this movie wasn't released in theaters is beyond me. Madhouse is a truly worthy addition to any genre fan's collection of twisted, psychopathic movies. And the door to a sequel is wide open at the end. More PLEASE!",1155427200,,1187,4.3710407239819

Once he meets the strange prisioner in the basement, things go from normal to crazy real quickly. The casting in this movie wasn't the best, but the characters WERE well written. Overall, I had fun watching it, and the violence is top-notch.

2198399,4,B0006ZXJ2U,"[brief plot synopsis]

Clark (Joshua Leonard) is a young and idealistic new intern at a run-down and out-dated mental health facility. His aspirations for cleaning the place hit a snag when he butts heads with Dr. Franks (Lance Henrikson) who seems to not mind that the patients never seem to get any better. Shortly Clark begins seeing things and death and mayhem invade the reality of the ""Madhouse"". Together Clark and Sara must uncover who or what it is that stalks the asylum and survive the massacre.

[good things]

Nicely directed, some pretty good kills, and a good story. The directing was superb, and it gave us some nice visual experiences, great cinematography, and all around tight scenery. There weren't many kills in this, but the ones it showed were pretty brutal and bloody. I also liked the cast, alot of good actors, and alot of very seasoned veterans (Lance Henrickson and Leslie Jordan).

[the bad]

It was hard for me to believe that an asylum like this existed. I don't see alot of this happening in real life, and I guess it is a horror film and they don't really have to mirror reality. I would have also liked more kills. While the script wasn't at all unique, but nicely done and directed, it was almost obvious who the killer was.

[final thoughts]

I may be playing favorites with this because William Butler is a friend, but it is a damn good movie. The all around feel to this movie is pretty cold and eerie. Joshua Leonard (from Blair Witch Project) delivers a great performance that almost makes me forget about his role (as himself) in The Blair Witch Project. Each character was nicely done and scripted. Even though the script could have taken a few different turns and made the story a bit harder to figure out, I still feel this is one of the better movies to be released in 2004.",1136246400,2,1819,4.595679012345679

Well, he begins to see a little boy...the boy might be a ghost. People are dying all around him and he doesnt know who it is. He then talks up a conversation with a mental patient named Ben, who likes to not show his face and Clark falls for one of his co-workers, Sarah, played by Jordan Ladd (Cabin Fever, Waiting) and he finds out when she was a little girl she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Or..or could it be Clark's mind that's messing with him...or, or could it be the head of the institution, played by Lance Henriksen (Hard Target, Near Dark), whose doing it because Clark finds out that the staff members are giving the patients placebo pills rather then the regular pill...hmm, could be. Not much here considering the cast. Leonard didn't dig deep into his role enough..it was a failed effort....Ladd is pretty to look at but the only good thing she does was take off her shirt and Lance Henriksen, well what cheesy direct-to-video horror movie or horror movie sequel doesnt star Lance Henrisken? Also starring Leslie Jordon (tv's Boston Legal) and Nastasha Lyonne (American Pie, Blade Trinity)....yeah she wasn't that great in this either.

2198404,4,B0006ZXJ2U,"'Madhouse' is a visual treat for those who love horror flicks.  It begins with a flashy, fleshy kaleidoscope of images that hooks you even during the intro; surreal, insane images that tease your madness.

Young Clark Stevens (Joshua Leonard) arrives at Cunningham Hall, a Mental Health Facility, for his internship.  He is full of clever ideas to make the facility cleaner and more functional.  Dr. Franks (the talented Lance Henrikson) doesn't receive Clark's ideas pleasantly.  He informs Clark that things are fine just the way they are, and that Clark will be expected to do his job and nothing more.

Clark meets Dr. Morton (who reminded me of Henry Gibson but is played by Leslie Jordan), an absentminded, likeable guy who's been at Cunningham Hall for 25 years.  There's Head Nurse Hendricks (Dendrie Taylor), who is a little like Nurse Ratchett in 'Cuckoos Nest'.

Showing Clark around the facility is pretty co-worker Sara (Jordan Ladd) who has an easygoing temperament and shrugs off Hendricks gruffness.  When Sara's tour takes Clark to the basement, you, the viewer, are in for a treat.  This is a spooky place.  It's lockup time down here, where the ""patients everyone wants to forget about"" goes.

Right about the time Clark begins to witness some pretty unsavory events happening around Cunningham Hall, people begin to die.  For the aficionado, there is a lovely, grisly tongue-severing scene not to be missed.  The patient in Cell 44, down in the basement, begins to talk to Clark.  He has some unsettling things to say, and seems to know an awful lot about the gruesome events upstairs.  About the time Clark decides he's had enough, it's too late.

Lion's Gate Films has been putting out some very good films lately.  'Madhouse' was good enough for theater release; I don't know why it went straight to DVD, other than possible competition from 'Saw'.  While the plot was predictable and not terribly unique, there are some nice twists involved.  The atmosphere is excellent; phenomenally creepy and dark.  The acting is good and the gore is satisfyingly present, with decent FX.  Not as good as 'Saw', but far, far better than 'The Grudge' or its ilk.

Rent it first, but you may find yourself buying it.  Enjoy!",1125532800,23,2233,4.909090909090909

On the plus side you have good acting, solid and interesting ""classic"" haunted house/mansion-story for the horror-fan, good effects, ""nice"" locations and a camera-work that sometimes reminds of ""13 Ghosts"" (not that I am a big fan of that movie, but the zoomed-in ghost-stills are effective for the chills down the spines of the viewers...).

On the other hand; Not a very interesting outcome of the ""plot"". Why should every haunting have to be explained -let it be the ""obvious"" instead, just don't try to remake ""Sixth Sence"" or ""The Others"" in every thriller/horror been released since those. The ending this way was a ""downer"", and the movie loses its' solid grip by the end of the movie where it should have been otherwise.

2198407,5,B0006ZXJ2U,"Madhouse proved to be quite a pleasant surprise for this horror fan.  I really liked a lot of what first-time writer-director (not to mention former horror actor) William Butler tried to do here.  It was also something of a kick to see Joshua Leonard of The Blair Witch Project fame once again (he's left the woods outside Burkittsville far behind, trading up to a rather geeky new look for this film).  There's a fair share of gore, a nicely claustrophobic feel to the whole experience, quite effective ghostly manifestations, some wickedly deft plot twists, and a really cool, darkly surreal opening montage to start things out on the right foot.  Jordan Ladd is a delight, and the intimidating presence of Lance Henriksen is put to pretty good use.  I also found the plot to be surprisingly complex and methodically laid out.  I for one had my expectations altered a time or two when the final scenes rolled around.  Some people talk about the ending being obvious (I disagree) or the film trying to do too much, but Madhouse, in my opinion, succeeds admirably in setting itself apart from other lunatic asylum-based horror films.  This thing has a look and feel all its own, and I honestly don't see how any horror fan could not enjoy this film.

Joshua Leonard plays Clark Stephens, a super-smart student doing his internship at a mental institution.  He is sort of a know-it-all who is less than impressed by the condition of Cunningham Hall and the way its patients are treated.  The man in charge, Dr. Franks (Henriksen) doesn't really care about making improvements, though; as a matter of fact, he doesn't even seem to care about curing anybody.  The other two doctors are friendly enough, but the head nurse is something of a battleaxe.  Fortunately for Clark, there's a young nurse named Sara (Ladd) who, besides being cute as a button, shows him around and clues him in on how things work around there.  By and large, this is not a healthy place, and some of the ""caregivers"" don't belong anywhere near the mental health profession.  Clark gets off on the wrong foot, and things basically go downhill from there.

Cunningham Hall seems to have a little bit of a problem with people dying ugly, violent deaths there.  A consistent outward flow of body bags filled with colleagues tends to raise the stress level among the staff, and the fact that Clark keeps seeing a ghostly little boy running around the place doesn't do any wonders for his state of mind.  Besides Sara, Clark's closest confidante becomes a mysterious patient dwelling in the shadows of a cell down in the high security ward.  Obviously, a mental health professional should not take the words of a caged schizophrenic too seriously, but the guy seems to know things and makes more sense than the men in the white coats.  All of this lends an air of suspenseful mystery to the story.  As things work their way toward a conclusion, the writer-director does a wonderful job of giving us false leads and turning the whole story around on a dime; as I said, he kept me guessing until the very end.  I can't imagine why some would say the ending ruins the film; as far as I'm concerned, the ending makes what might have been a good horror film into a well-nigh great horror film.

As a gorehound, I appreciated the blood and gore that this film threw my way, but I was most impressed by the plot.  Maybe there's a weak spot or two here or there, but overall Madhouse gives us a plot that is much more complicated than your average horror film - once you know the whole story, you instantly think about certain earlier scenes that contained clues you might not have picked up on at the time.  This is a much more intelligent script than I'm used to seeing in horror films.  That is just one of many reasons I personally give Madhouse five stars.",1116288000,16,3819,4.637444279346211

2198413,5,B0006ZXJ2U,"Ignore the bad reviews, they don't know what a good flick is.

Madhouse has great acting... and the story grabs you from the beginning.  The insane asylum is great as are the odd characters you will meet. There is great music, some cool gore, scary scenes, and also has a great twist ending.  It's definetly worth checking out.  Don't waste your money on the ""Ring Two"" rent or buy ""Madhouse"" instead and support non mainstream horror/thriller.

I just finished watching it and I already can't wait to see it again.",1111276800,,515,4.677777777777778
2198414,2,B0006ZXJ2U,"'Madhouse' stars Joshua Leonard, looking like Martha Stewart with a goatee, who begins an internship at a nuthouse.  Martha gets settled in and then the wackiness ensues.

This movie is a mess:  Martha starts seeing some creeply little kid running around randomly thoughout the joint, some dirty crazy girl is seeing stuff(um...she's crazy so I doubt that anyone working there would believe her but thank god Martha was there because he certainly does).  And Martha is about the least interesting/most boring lead that I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in a film, but at least the supporting cast of fruitloop inmates are occasionally semi-amusing.

Even though this is a total crapfest, there are a two cool things that manage to shine through:  first, Lance Henrickson.  He shows up as the big cheese of the nuthouse and Lance, even though he is a totally sweet pimp and is totally awesome in his ten minutes of screentime, tries but even he can't save this stinker.  Secondly, the crusty and disguisting cells that the asylum keeps the crazies in are sweet because I think that those are the kind of places that nutballs should be kept in in real life.  I mean really...if they're crazy they don't really mind sleeping in their own filth, right?  So if no one has to clean it, then thats less taxpayer's money wasted on, well, waste.

Now, I just watched this movie last night and to tell you the truth, I don't even remember how it ended.  It is boring straight-to-rental mush that you will forget, like I did, as soon as you finish the film.  The only thing that will stick in your memory is Martha Stewart with a goatee.  This guy's face will be burned into my brain forever.

But by all means, totally check it out if you love boring not-so-scary scary movies or if you're a hardcore Lance Henrickson fan.  Other than that, skip this doodie-fest.",1111276800,5,1859,4.691358024691358

8044291,3,B0006ZXJ2U,"Madhouse (William Butler, 2004)

An hour into William Butler's Madhouse, a thriller that should have been much, much better than it is, I was ready to sing its praises to the moon and back--it's just the right combination of weird characters, weird situations, and outrageous mystery to press all my buttons. Then, after a bit more meandering, we get to the Big Reveal and, well, the movie has set so many traps for itself that it would've taken an immortal director to sidestep them all. Which is not to say it's not worth watching, but it sets the viewer up for some unreasonable expectations.

Plot: Clark Stevens (The Blair Witch Project's Joshua Leonard) is a new intern at an asylum being held together by spit, duct tape, and the indomitable will of Dr. Franks (Lance Henriksen), who runs the place with both an iron fist and an iron Girl Friday, Nurse Hendricks (The Fighter's Dendrie Taylor). As soon as Clark bunks down for his first night, weird things begin to happen, and pretty soon, he's seeing the ghost of a small boy roaming the halls, striking up a friendship with Ben London, the scariest guy in the psycho wing, and embarking on a friendship-which-could-end-up-being-a-tentative-romance with a fellow intern, Sara (Grace's Jordan Ladd). The last of those may be the weirdest of all. But when Nurse Hendricks is discovered the next morning murdered in the basement, Clark seizes the opportunity to investigate as a way of trying to uncover what he suspects to be corruption in the Franks regime.

It's all quite wonderful until we get to the Big Reveal, which kind of falls flat before immediately going as far over the top as it can. But I still had more fun with this movie than I expected to, which in the end is what it's all about, as far as I'm concerned. Good acting, good pace, and a well-earned atmosphere for most of the film gets a recommend from this camp. ***",1365465600,,1892,4.692771084337349
8044292,4,B0006ZXJ2U,"Disturbing images...check!  Run down asylum...check!  Gratuitous horror movie semi sex scene...check!  Things that make you jump...check!

Okay in all seriousness this movie hits on just about every point a horror junkie would expect out of an asylum horror flick.  It has that shut in Shutter Island feel as far as being remote and you can use your imagination to take yourself back to House on Haunted Hill when Vannacutt was running things.  With that frame of reference you can settle in for this movie.

The acting is not terrible like some of the movies I have had to flat out shut off because I couldn't even make it through the first five minutes.  The plot is developed and the ends are tied up in the end like a pretty package.  Be aware that there is a lot going on a once as far as little issues with the characters or with the institution I suppose for lack of a better word.  The movie feels like it is going to move quickly and then slows down, but it was not unbearable.  I had a little bit of a problem with Sarah's character, but that was only because of the pace it was done at (you'll understand if you watch).

If you take anything away from this movie it should be this: meatloaf is not a midnight snack.

I gave this movie 4 stars and not 5 as 5 is kind of like saying ""I love you and want to marry you"" for me.  Four stars means ""hey we can date for a while"".  It was a good movie, but I'm not ready to get too serious with it.",1359676800,2,1451,4.187725631768953
