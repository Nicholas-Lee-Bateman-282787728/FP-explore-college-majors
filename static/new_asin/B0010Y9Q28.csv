3055552,5,B0010Y9Q28,"I saw this movie years ago and fell in love with William Holden -- I had not seen many of his films at the time.  He is so handsome and dashing.  The plot is simple and sweet -- fine performances and some funny, tender moments.  I recommend it for anyone who loves a good romantic comedy.  I believe it was a very successful film at the time it was released.  A sequel was made, but I have not seen it.  I've been trying to buy this on DVD for years, but it's not available yet.",1220918400,5,478,3.9789473684210526

3055557,5,B0010Y9Q28,"Oh, Albert Kummer, that poor bastard of a banker. He really should've put his foot down and not allowed his lovely fiance to step out with that strapping soldier on furlough. But, then, we wouldn't have gotten this sparkling post-war romantic comedy. So, good on ya, after all, Albert Kummer.

Someday, DEAR RUTH will be available on DVD and on that day, oh, how I'll cavort in cartwheels 'til the sun goes down! I happen to think that DEAR RUTH is Joan Caulfield's best film. Years ago I watched this movie and vowed that Joan Caulfield would someday be mine. And then I realized that DEAR RUTH was released in 1947, and that I didn't much care for a June-September romance.

DEAR RUTH takes place in 1944, spans two hectic days in the life of the Wilkins household, and you can point the finger at precocious 16-year-old Miriam Wilkins (Mona Freeman) as the meddling catalyst. Miriam means well, but she's one of them enthusiastic sorts who floats petitions around the neighborhood and who doesn't think twice about volunteering her dad as a blood donor (but without consulting dear pater). Patriotic and eager to bolster wartime morale, Miriam has taken to corresponding with an Army lieutenant who is stationed overseas. Only, in these letters, she passes herself off as her 22-year-old sister, Ruth (Caulfield), complete with attached glamour photo. DEAR RUTH is what happens when Lieutenant Bill Seacroft (William Holden) earns a two-day leave and goes to visit his beautiful pen pal, Ruth.

The complications, they are delicious. Ruth Wilkins, reserved and proper, has just now gotten engaged to sour bank executive, Albert Kummer (Billy de Wolfe, who was born exasperated). Still, Ruth is good-hearted enough that she decides to carry on with the deception for a bit rather than dash the lieutenant's hopes so abruptly. Probably doesn't hurt that the serviceman is so good-looking, or that William Holden plays him so disarmingly. Ruth intends to let him down easy. Except that a military man in love on a two-day pass is a force to be reckoned with. Plenty of fun rests on eyeballing Billy de Wolfe as his increasingly vexed character is forced to sit on the sidelines while his girl gets romanced by an amorous G.I. It doesn't help that Ruth's parents seem to approve of the young lieutenant.

One thing leads to another and the plot soon assumes this runaway train feel. I love it that Ruth keeps insisting that she has control of the situation and of the lieutenant, and yet events continue to escalate. Things get so out of hand that Ruth's level-headed dad is driven to advise his agitated wife (in a resigned tone): ""Don't struggle, dear. Just drift."" Edward Arnold lands the plum role - one of the best in his career - of Ruth and Miriam's father, Judge Wilkins, and he plays him with wisdom and with such wonderful humor. More than anyone else, Edward Arnold is indispensable for grounding the story. But he also gets a lot of good lines. When he nearly collapses after having given blood, he ruefully remarks: ""I hope the young fellow that gets my blood doesn't need it too badly, because I have no confidence in it."" Heh.

DEAR RUTH doesn't merit its obscure status. I love this movie, love its flawless cast and its irrepressible humor. And enough people relished it when it first came out in 1947 that it generated two sequels: DEAR WIFE in 1949 and DEAR BRAT in 1951. It's even relevant on a literary level. J.D. salinger was inspired to name his hero ""Holden Caulfield"" in THE CATCHER IN THE RYE after he glimpsed the marquee billing for DEAR RUTH: starring William HOLDEN and Joan CAULFIELD. This film deserves more love and more pub. It deserves a cup of Sanka. And if you've seen this movie, then you know what I mean. Although, somewhere, the clueless Albert Kummer still doesn't get the joke.

By the way, beware making a DVD purchase of this film because there isn't an official DVD release yet, so odds are you'll end up with a shady product. The DEAR RUTH DVD I purchased seems to have been transferred from a VHS copy which, in turn, was taped from a showing on the AMC Channel. I wanted a copy bad enough that I took a chance, and my ""DVD"" was pretty much what I expected. I had to do it, though.

8239393,2,B0010Y9Q28,"Be warned this is a DVD-R and will absolutely not work in older DVD players. And although the artwork on the case seems to be original it is clearly a well done copy if you you know what you're looking for (or have a brother in the industry like I do). I was able to get it to play on my blu-ray player on my computer so that my mom could at least watch it.

I was offered a refund for the disk if I shipped it back, but was not offered a refund on the shipping for either direction. In fact during my initial complaint about the no sound problem on my mom's old DVD player, the guy told me that new DVD players were so cheap we should just go buy her a new one.

Needless to say I was not impressed, and tried to explain that at my mom's age any new electronics are considerably problematic. That's when I was told to just mail it back.

My mom has been looking for this movie for so many years, so I wasn't surprised at how upset she was that it would have to be sent back. In the end, I kept it for her since eighteen bucks isn't going to break me and she can always watch it at my house on my computer.

Ultimately I gave the review for this as two stars. The disk is watchable, though the quality isn't the greatest, it's only a little less than what you would expect for a movie that old that has not been remastered. The sound on my computer wasn't great, but I didn't miss but a few words so it wasn't awful. My biggest problem is that although this is listed as a DVD-R in the format there is absolutely no explanation on what that means any where in the description. As a matter of fact, at the time of writing this review there is no information at all in the description. It might be an authorized copy of this movie, but honestly that really should be explained somewhere.

I guess I'm not telling people out there NOT to buy this, because if you have been looking forever and a day like I had been before I found this, then you might be willing to overlook it's problems. Don't buy it expecting what you normally see watching or hearing from a refurbished old movie, and make sure you have a pretty new blu-ray player and maybe it will be worth your money buying it.

For me the movie itself was adorably funny and might have even been worth all the rigamarole I had to go through so my mom and I could sit down and watch it together. But overall my experience on the problems and frustration on this whole endeavor only earns it two stars.",1417910400,6,2454,4.112734864300626
