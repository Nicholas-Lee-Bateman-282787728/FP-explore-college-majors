THERE ARE WHITE FLASH LINES THROUGHOUT THE FILM AND AT ONE POINT THE PICTURE COMPLETLY ROLES AND BECOMES DISTORTED AS IF THE FILM WAS OR HAD BEEN DAMAGED IN A VCR PLAYER. THIS IS THE WORST QUALITY I HAVE EVER PURCHASED ON A DVD ESPECIALLY ONE THAT COST ME OVER $20.00. IF THIS IS WHAT AMAZON IS DOING TO GOOD CUSTOMERS BY ALLOWING MERCHANTS OR SELLERS TO RIP PEOPLE OFF BY CHARGING SUCH HIGH PRICES FOR POOR QUALITY FILMS THEY WILL SOON LOOSE CUSTOMERS. I NOW FEEL ALITTLE NERVOUS OR HESITANT IN PURCHASING OLD FILMS OR OUT OF PRINT FILMS FROM AMAZOM.COM. PLEASE POST THIS REVIEW SO OTHERS WILL NOT BE TAKEN BY THIS COMPANY,"" CALLED MOM AND POP VIDEO SHOP PRESENTS "" THAT SOLD THE LOCH NESS HORROR FILM TO ME ON AMAZON.COM THANKS.",1344124800,2,873,4.296969696969697

I don't know how or why these terrible copies are available but be warned because this is about as nasty a copy as you can get.",1337126400,4,243,4.191489361702128
8168412,1,B000MG0PD4,"The Loch Ness Horror (Larry Buchanan, 1981)

Larry Buchanan never had any illusions about the quality of the films he made; he described himself quite accurately as a schlockmeister. And yet over the course of his long, unstoried career, a number of his films went on to become cult classics. Mars Needs Women! is foremost among the lot, but you'll hear older film snobs describe The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald and Common Law Wife in similarly rhapsodic terms. And, of course, Elton John paid Buchanan the ultimate tribute: the title of his Marilyn Monroe biopic became the first line of ""Candle in the Wind."" (Not that Goodbye, Norma Jean is one whit better than Mars Needs Women!.) On the other hand, you have High Yellow, an amazingly ill-thought-out film I'm sure Buchanan's descendents would like to forget even exists. And It's Alive!, a TV-movie often confused with Larry Cohen's film of the same name in cable-company descriptions, and thus DVRed by legions of schlock-horror fans hoping for a cannibal baby and instead getting a rubber-suited lizard creature. And then there is The Loch Ness Horror, and the less said about what would be the last regular work Buchanan had in Hollywood (he would make three more films in the twenty-three years between The Loch Ness Horror and his death), the better. But since that's the movie I'm currently reviewing, I can't avoid saying at least something about it, as distasteful as the task may be. Remember, folks, I watch these things so you don't have to.

In the world of Larry Buchanan, Nessie, of course, is real, or as real as an inflatable toy can be. And for some reason she's mad. Normally, you'd blame it on the idiots who decided that it would be a great idea to steal Nessie's egg. (That there's only one plesiosaur in the Loch raises the question of how said egg will get fertilized, but this is a Larry Buchanan movie...) But Nessie's kind of pissed before that, as evidenced by the rising body count in Loch Ness. Nevertheless, we'll take egg theft as the prime motion device--I hesitate to call it a ""plot""--in this mess and run with it. Like a dinosaur egg. Ha! Get it? Anyway, the egg poachers are part of this, as well as a couple of visiting American researchers, and some locals, and... why am I attempting to give you a plot description? Big inflatable monster chomps on people. What more do you need to know?

Not a great deal, as it turns out. This is a painfully low-budget movie. Buchanan cast his kids as a money-saver, and they're the best actors here. (That is not meant as a compliment in any way.) The monster effects are hysterical. About the best thing I can say about it is that you can probably use it at parties as background comedy. A phenomenally awful piece of work.

8168413,4,B000MG0PD4,"In the mysterious and beautiful lake of Loch Ness where it's home to the fabled creature, a couple of nessie hunters stole the famed monster's egg as the beast goes on a rampage killing people so she can get her egg back.

Entertaining and damn near hilarious monster movie with bad acting, laughable fake scottish accents and a incoherent plot. But i think the monster is realistic at night in this movie and amusing sequences like the title creature killing people in funny slo-mo ways.

If your into MST3K and b-movies like me, then this could be a treat and a real guilty pleasure.",1185580800,4,585,4.615384615384615
