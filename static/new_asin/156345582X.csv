7796373,5,156345582X,"I love this video set.  We are teaching the presidents one at a time.  This set offers about 15 minutes of facts about each president.  It also has a couple of slides that you can pause and gather your info quickly.  It is just enough to keep the children's interest, but not enough to bore them to death.  The only problem is they have not updated it.  So we are short a few presidents.",1323388800,,387,4.162162162162162
7796374,5,156345582X,"As a teacher for sophomore U.S. history I use these videos as a quick introduction on each president.  Each segment is about 8 minutes long and covers things like where they were born, what their schooling was, what party they belonged to and some interesting things about their background before they were president.  Believe it or not in only 8 minutes you also get some of the highlights and lowlights of their time as president.  These are fantastic if all you want to do is introduce or quickly cover a president but this is not for someone who is looking for in-depth coverage of any of the presidents",1221264000,,607,4.601851851851852
