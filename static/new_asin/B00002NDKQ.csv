I left it for a while but recently rediscovered it.  This heartwarming tale makes you feel real empathy for the characters.  The love story is touching, and, with the final cry of ""I'll be back with the king!"" You're silently pleading for Edward to come back instantly and continue the story.  Absolutely wonderful, a family movie, an adult movie, or a children's movie, everyone will enjoy ""Children of the New Forest""",1128556800,7,567,4.814432989690721
