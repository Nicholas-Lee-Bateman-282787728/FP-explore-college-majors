8618416,5,B00FRVELSY,"No major composer wrote more music for children than Benjamin Britten.  This documentary examines Britten's love of children as well as features interviews with many of the now adult children with whom he had friendships.  The concurrence of their comments is striking.  Each one of them, some with emotion in their voices, speak of Britten which such fondness and love.  It is a view of Britten from a different perspective and it's a quite moving one.  This is a film by John Bridcut who once again makes great film making look utterly effortless.  A must for any Britten fan!",1397692800,5,578,4.787878787878788
