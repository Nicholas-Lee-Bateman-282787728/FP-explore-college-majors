6301995,4,B00IX304UW,This was good. The ending was not what I expected. This was also a love story which I liked.,1404691200,2,92,3.8947368421052633
6301996,5,B00IX304UW,"I really liked this movie.  It wasn't a typical ""killer stalker"" film.  It's a film about trust and relationships. (and there is a killer on the loose too).  How do you know who to trust, if you don't remember anything about them.  After the film, my wife kept talking about what she would do if she lost her memory and if she would trust me.  (She finally decided that she would.)
Worth watching.",1404086400,8,397,4.383561643835616
6301997,1,B00IX304UW,Horrible! Absolutely terrible acting. Worse than a school play. How on earth Casper Van Diem and Armand Assante were part of this junk is beyond me.,1404000000,2,148,4.730769230769231
6301998,5,B00IX304UW,"I loved it! It's not your typical thriller. It was more than that, it was about relationships, perceptions, trust. Some of us enjoy a more complicated and thought-out story line and this delivers. Barbie Castro was wonderful. It's always nice to see fresh talent execute a difficult character. Barbie's character is genuine and complex. I can't wait to see Castro in more roles. I have a feeling that I'll be a big fan of her movies. Casper van Dien is gorgeous. The music complimented each scene nicely. And the quality of the picture was amazing for a TV movie. The whole cast was great and Barbie Castro is the shooting star to watch out for here. I highly recommend this movie.",1407715200,,681,4.636363636363637
6301999,2,B00IX304UW,"Not too bad but not too good either. I had to give 2 stars cause the title gives the plot away and the movie gets predictable. Acting and story could have been better, it had good potential...",1407369600,2,192,4.216216216216216
6302000,1,B00IX304UW,Ive only written one other review  but I felt it necessary to tell others not to waste your time.  First this really isn't a crime story. They never deal with the actual murders.  Barbie Castro was unbelievably bad in this movie. I'm shocked Eric Roberts even had two 10 second scenes . And Armand must have owed the director to be in this movie at all. Although his participation was minimal to the story such as it was.  Looking for a good crime drama this is not it.,1406764800,3,469,4.295454545454546
6302001,4,B00IX304UW,... perfect movie for a Saturday afternoon.,1406764800,,43,5.285714285714286
6302002,1,B00IX304UW,"Without question one of the worst movies I've ever seen - in just about every category.  The lead actress's verbal delivery was wooden, without inflection (and she was supposedly a TV journalist, which requires a visible display of personality) and her face was completely lacking in expression. In short, she was unbelievable - and extremely so.

Actually, I think that the only actor displaying anything remotely resembling a spark of life was the young man who (briefly) portrayed the apparently illegitimate son.  The entire cast was otherwise rather strangely disaffected

Plot and dialogue were weak.  Any attempts at suspense were ineffective.  There were scenes that appeared to hold no significance whatsoever and irrelevant to the story.

I have no idea what they were trying to achieve with the ending, but to me it came across as just plain silly.  Exactly what the Hell sort of moment was that supposed to create, anyhow?

In fairness to being able to present an honest review, I did in fact watch the entire movie as I would not have felt entitled to write anything had I not actually seen the whole thing. I kept hoping for a while that it might improve a little; however, I ultimately found no value of any sort in it - not even that of the simple mind-numbing entertainment that's occasionally fun to watch. It was just plain poorly done.",1406678400,3,1355,4.8311688311688314
6302003,1,B00IX304UW,"Could not finish it it was so bad. Clearly, these people never studied acting and the film quality was horrible. waste of money.",1406505600,2,128,4.608695652173913
6302004,1,B00IX304UW,"One the most poorly acted movies I've ever tried to watch.  I said tried to watch because we had to turn it off after about a half an hour.  The quality of the acting was, well, if you've ever watched a 1980's porn movie, the acting was better than this bomb.  I am sorry I wasted even a small amount of money on this bummer.",1406505600,3,325,3.9692307692307693
6302005,4,B00IX304UW,The fact my son was on the crew may have something to do with how much I liked the movie but I really thought it was quite good.,1405987200,4,128,3.607142857142857
6302006,2,B00IX304UW,Starts out slow and only gets worse. The acting is poor. There is no real script. Waste of time and money.,1405641600,,106,4.095238095238095

8645895,1,B00IX304UW,"This might be the very worst movie I have ever watched......99% is the acting the lead actress is so very horrible I had to fast forward through most of the movie, she is a dreadful actor......I feel like I am in an acting class watching this, shame on the casting for choosing her!! The main actor is not bad but most everyone else is terrible what a waste of 3.99 to rent this......",1424131200,3,384,4.273972602739726
8645896,1,B00IX304UW,"Nothing says PU like a made for TV film with both Casper Van Dien and Eric Roberts. How could this possibly be good? TV investigative reporter Daria Valdez Morrow (Barbara Castro) is involved in a car accident with her perfect husband Sam (Van Dien). His mother just passed away. Daria was investigating a serial killer at the time of the accident. She awakens with amnesia and very distrusting of her husband, who she no longer knows. She starts to piece things together about the killer and being there is only one suspect....unless....

The film had pauses for commercial breaks. Nothing screams low budget like a black screen with people screaming. The acting and dialogue were as bad as was the plot that plodded along leaving us absolutely nowhere other than the fact we knew who the killer was from the opening credits because...

PLOT SPOILER he always plays the killer in these low budget films.

TV safe. No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1414454400,,943,4.808641975308642

8645898,5,B00IX304UW,"I enjoyed the film very much. Caught it at MundoFox also the other day. Wonderful ensemble cast. Enjoyed from the cameo appearances of Eric Roberts, to Armand Assante's forceful and deliberate presence,  to Casper Van Diem's unexpected, vulnerable and sensitive character. What impacted me the most, along with my family members, was the amazing talent, sensibility, and truthfulness portrayed by Ms. Barbie Castro. First time I see her in a TV film, and I will definately be looking out for her. The story was original with a great kick to the end. Didn't see it coming. Kudos to the director and the producers for bringing a wonderful story to life. The cinamatography was simply breathtaking....especially the forest scenes and the romantic ones.",1410307200,2,749,5.139344262295082

8645900,5,B00IX304UW,"This movie is a MUST WATCH!!!  I found the acting to be superb, and the story is line compelling.  From beginning to end, this is the kind of movie that leaves you on edge wanting to uncover what is reality as opposed to what is just an imagination. The main female protagonist in this movie, played by Barbie Castro has amnesia, and the viewers have to determine how much the character has been imagining in her own mind and how much actually occurred in this plot turning story.  Viewers will surely enjoy trying to solve the mystery.  Plus, the end of the movie is open ended, which invites a sequel.",1407974400,,603,4.454545454545454
