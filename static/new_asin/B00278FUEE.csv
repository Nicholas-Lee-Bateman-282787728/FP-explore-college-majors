So, I guess it wasn't the best idea to buy from a seller in Australia, but I didn't know where it was coming from when I placed the order.  The DVD worked in my computer though, and it was a good video.",1265587200,,290,3.9827586206896552

Still very interesting to learn about this grueling race.",1387670400,,121,5.05
8354212,1,B00278FUEE,"Honest review of Road to Roubaix

While I cycle, I don't follow cycling. I don't know the names of the big stars - but I can appreciate all the hard work any cyclist puts into their time on a bike. I also watch every cycling documentary I can. If you want the short version - this one is horrible.

Here is the longer version.

Most of the runtime is spent watching cyclists sign autographs. Again, and again and again. Then there are lots of photos of cyclists in showers, and shower stalls. SOmetimes naked, sometimes half dressed. Then you get to see more autograph signing.

There are a few interview parts - and whoever was doing the interview sounds like they were picked at random from a crowd of Football fans, and asked to interview these cyclists and spectators about this event - which is very distinguishable from almost every other road race in the world. So what you get is everyone saying yes they'd love to win it. And... Maybe there was something else.

Oh yeah, there wasn't really anything about this race in general. You hear guys say they train for it, and you either have it in you or you don't. And the old lady in her camper that watches it every year. So cringe worthy, the guy interviewing just has no business in this movie.

IMPORTANT: Ok. This is the part that really, ultimately gets it 1 star from me. As I mentioned earlier - I don't know cyclists. But after watching them all sign autographs in their super brights, colourful jerseys and shorts, I was starting to get an idea of who was who, and what team they were on.

Then from out of nowhere a guy is signing an autograph and the next cut the race is on. What? But what has happened? Is it my eyes? Nope. For the next 15 minutes, the clips of the race are all shown in black and white. That's right. All the time I spent getting to know the racers by their kit - useless. All wide shots of black and white uniforms on black and white bikes on black and white roads. O look that guy crashed! Who was it I don't know because it was black and white and from a distance. O man a group of five crashed! Is there anyone in that group that was being interviewed and signing autographs for 20 minutes earlier in the show? How can I tell it's all black and white and from far away.

It was the single worst moment in cycling documentary history for me. It made me totally not care because I had no clue who was on the screen. And then... The race was over!! And the colour was back! yay!!!!!

I turned it off then, although I am sure the cameraman went into the showers with the guys to get more close ups of them washing their bodies and any dirt on them. Again.

This was horrible. So boring. There are other documentaries about this race that are 5 star worthy. These guys must have seen those and said let's take a different approach to showing this race. The 1 star approach. Avoid, Unless you like seeing dirty guys in shower stalls and seeing guys sign autographs turns your crank. Get it? Turns your crank? Ahhh... you get it....",1372550400,,3015,4.310954063604241
8354213,5,B00278FUEE,"Roubaix is the best. This movie is exciting and emotional...same as the race. If you are a cycling fan, you will love this movie.",1365724800,,129,4.416666666666667
8354214,2,B00278FUEE,"If you're really interested in this race you might like this.  As a fan of cycling and a fan of other documentaries similar to this I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't well made.  There were LOTS of interviews and they all sounded the same.  The race is hard, it's unique, it's special, etc.  It never really felt like there was a story being told, it was just snippets and clips of different aspects of this race, yet nothing was really too different.

It is a very unique race and deserves to have it's story told.  A hardcore fan ""might"" enjoy this, but there's no question it could have been done a lot better.",1350518400,,653,4.436974789915967
8354215,3,B00278FUEE,"I watch a lot of documentaries and enjoy cycling and cycling films. Road to Roubaix is okay but it could have been better.  Good documentaries rely a lot on a good story line, narration, music score and editing.  However, the film goes on stretches of footage without narration and the audience is left to wonder what is going on. Also the interviews of the cyclists seem to be monotonous. Road to Roubaix should have focused on the history of the race, the places where the race pass, the highlights of the race since it began and results of actual races. One good cycling documentary is Garmin-Cervelo's Beyond the Peloton series which one can watch for free on youtube.",1319760000,3,672,4.686440677966102
8354216,5,B00278FUEE,"I saw this at a movie theater and had to get the DVD. The movie is MOVING. If you like cycling, you will be amazed at the TOUGHNESS the Roubaix riders exhibit. The insight is enjoyable. The interviews are meaningful. If you want a DVD to pump you up before your local ride, this will do it.",1310774400,,290,4.105263157894737
8354217,2,B00278FUEE,"This film is about 60 minutes of present and former riders and journalists saying that the Paris-Roubaix is ""tough,"" ""painful"" and ""unlike any other race,"" which any cycling fan already knows; five minutes of randomly edited footage from the 2007 race, without commentary and inexplicably in black and white; and then five minutes of unedited footage of the winner walking to his team bus afterwards. There was no behind-the-scenes info, no interesting revelations about bike racing, and very few comments that went anywhere below the surface of the race.

I'd say if you have an unlimited budget for cycling goodies, go ahead and buy it, but if you have to prioritize, I'd put this at the bottom of the list.",1304899200,3,709,4.908333333333333
8354218,5,B00278FUEE,"This is a gorgeous, gritty portrayal of a one-day classic.  I cannot stop watching it!  The cinematography is outstanding and the story is a good balance of ""documentary"" and personal stories.  It made me want to jump on my bike and ride over some cobblestones!",1289865600,,261,4.7555555555555555
8354219,5,B00278FUEE,"I bought this DVD some time agao and for some reason took a while to get around to playing it. With Paris-Roubaix 2010 coming up at the end of the week I thought it would make a nice ""taster"" to watch. I'm an experienced racing cyclist with copies of most of the good (and some not so good) documentaries that have been made on the subject. this is certainly one of the top-notch films. The interviews are informative and candid looks at the riders in preparation for this great race and these are interspersed with expert commentary on the kind of race P-R is and beautiful (perhaps even moving) pieces of artistic filmwork on the riders preparing and riding the course. The cobbles themselves are represented as they form the character of the race. Finally the DVD does cover the events in the race (2009) and the winner himself. The behind the scenes footage is very inclusive and let's you see what the riders are going through when they are not on the bike doing their job. Cinematically stunning with a very strong musical score. Highly recommended.

Tech note - this is a double-sided DVD that is not region encoded (or rather is coded 0 for all regions). If you are having trouble playing it you should probably flip it over - one side is PAL format the other is NTSC.",1270684800,10,1276,4.523809523809524
