8688997,5,B00PQQY5PY,"Love this dvd. Not touristy stuff, just people who live on and love the land sharing what it is about for them and their generations of families. Gives you a real feel for how the Kiwis love the land and how connected they are to it. Saw it in a vacation rental in New Zealand and searched the internet for a copy to take home and share with family and friends.",1493337600,,361,4.098591549295775
