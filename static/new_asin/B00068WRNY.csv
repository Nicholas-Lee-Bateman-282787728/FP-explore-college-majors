8040459,5,B00068WRNY,"I felt it was a fun and light-hearted sequel to the wonderful and funny first movie. I saw them both on Netflix, loved them, and bought them right away! I am glad I added these movies to my movie collection. I feel, as far as sequels go, this was a great addition.",1329436800,,264,4.096153846153846

8040461,4,B00068WRNY,"I had gotten the sequel because I utterly enjoyed the first Iron Ladies and I was not disappointed. The original cast is back and the storyline is the team is experiencing a fall out because a copy cat team has emerged and one of the players has switched allegiance and the rest is trying to unite them again. On the second part we see how each of the friends came together while they were in college, as told by Jung while travelling with Chai to Southern China to persuade Pia who is performing in a cabaret club to come back and play with the team again. I stll laughed at the antics and was still cheering the team on to victory and hoping that the copy cats would eat their dirt, it was fun to watch and another good gay film added to my collection, I sometime wish that American gay film producers could lighten up sometimes and just produce a film that will make you feel good about yourself, gay life is gloomy enough with the personal battles we face but films like this shows us that there is a good side too and once in awhile we need that.",1104796800,11,1051,4.233830845771144
