8271826,5,B00194D2BA,"I've never really been that confident with performing colour corrections until one of the Senior Stylists at my work recommended I take a look at this DVD. Having watched others in this series, I was again impressed by how easy Randy makes it look in this demonstration of advanced hair colour correction. It's all fairly new techniques to me, but seems to be relatively straight forward and I can't wait to try these out on our clients. We get a few colour corrections in the salon and I feel like I have a better understanding of how to weave, highlight, foil and achieve better natural looking results.",1415491200,,605,4.663551401869159
