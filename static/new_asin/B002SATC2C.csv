3978922,5,B002SATC2C,"I have a little bit of canning experience but I bought this DVD hoping to learn a lot more, not only water bath canning but how to use a pressure canner.

The West Ladies provide very clear instruction about ""how to"" do water bath and pressure canning and explain when each should be used. I also enjoyed their instructions on how to pickle hard cooked eggs to use later in potato salads, etc.

I definitely learned enough to attempt even pressure canning this summer.  Highly recommended!",1271980800,24,489,4.662790697674419
3978923,5,B002SATC2C,"I wondered how much information about herbs could be packed into a one hour DVD.  The answer... a lot!

This is a wonderful DVD and so much fun to watch, I've actually watched it over a few times already.  Of course, a lot of the charm comes from the four West Ladies.

Watching this DVD is almost as good as joining them in their herb garden and outdoor kitchen as they explain the growing of herbs, making herbal teas, making vinegars, etc.  Highly recommended!",1271980800,18,463,4.464285714285714
3978924,5,B002SATC2C,"This is an excellent video - high quality & well produced. It gives GREAT info especially for visual learners like myself who sometimes have trouble reading something in a book then making it work in a real-life situation. This gave great info for those who are starting to can for the first time. Invaluable resource for a beginning to intermediate canners! If you are a very experienced canner, you might not get a LOT of valuable information from this DVD, but you will still be inspired by these ladies & it will give you more gusto to make your canning day even better.  I remember canning with my grandmother when I was younger, this reminded me so much of that with her walking me through each step so carefully & with so much love hoping to pass the trade onto me. =)",1267574400,17,775,4.457746478873239

3978926,5,B002SATC2C,"I received  the complete collection for a gift and what a delight these dvds are! I am a herb enthusiast and I have been using and studying herbs for several years, so I fully expected not to learn anything new in this dvd but there actually were a couple things that were new to me.  I will say that if you are new to using herbs that this is the herb primer for you! The dvd is not too long  nor does it overwhelm you with information but rather focuses on a few easy things you can do at home. The beginning teaches you to recognize a few common herbs and a little about growing them. They move on to instructions for herbal teas, herb storage, herb butters,vinegars and tonics.  Not only is this dvd educational but the West ladies are charming and a pleasure to watch. The beautiful country setting will make you long for a simple natural lifestyle and the West ladies will motivate you  to fine tune your homemaking skills.",1262131200,29,929,4.3468208092485545

3978981,4,B002SATC2C,"I get these videos from our library as the price seems a bit steep ($7-$8 would be better).  The West ladies are lovely women and I enjoy watching them and learning from them.  Today I found out that basil keeps away bugs.  If rubbing my skin with a basil leaf will work for mosquitoes, I'm all for it!  Also, today, I heard their song ""Green Beans In The Garden.""  It went straight to my heart.  God bless these lovely ladies.",1408752000,,427,4.275

3978987,5,B002SATC2C,I enjoyed this dvd very much.  It was to the point and has many good points .  I gave it to my niece to help her learn how to can. We canned together also but this is fun to watch and makes learning more interesting!,1382313600,,216,3.7777777777777777
3978988,5,B002SATC2C,"Really enjoy these ladies! Kind and gentle hostesses, and I learned a couple of new things, too! :D Not necessarily a video to teach you everything you need to know about growing every kind of vegetable or herb, but still informative.",1380758400,,234,4.7317073170731705

3979008,5,B002SATC2C,"This DVD came recommended by one of my favorite blogs.  I am so glad that it was because I have been wanting to can for YEARS but I've always been afraid to try it.  This DVD gives you very detailed step by step instructions on how to can.  It has delicious recipes (especially for Jam), wonderful safety guidelines and you honestly do feel like you are right there with the West family learning how to can.  Thanks to these lovely ladies on this DVD, we were able to can our first batch of blackberry Jam.  =)

Yes, the DVD is a little bit pricey but it's worth every bit of it! You won't regret it.",1334707200,8,600,4.173913043478261

3979010,2,B002SATC2C,"First let me say, the West ladies were very nice and I truly believed they knew their way around the garden. It was a nice video and actually seemed to me the unscripted family project of the summer, with Mom and the girls as the stars. That being said, in this video these ladies have an enormous garden, full off all sorts of flowers, vegetables, and herbs. How long is this video? 49 minutes. I really felt like they could have chosen to show many, many more vegetables and tips, but for some reason chose to focus very narrowly on a few subjects. I did not doubt their expertise, but I just felt this very short DVD did not live up to its title.",1325376000,13,649,4.241935483870968
3979011,3,B002SATC2C,I've been watching all their videos this week and they are a good over view of a skill you might be interested in learning. The family is charming and they are enjoyable to watch. Still I'm glad I borrowed and didn't purchase them. I do not feel they are worth the amount they are charging. If they were cheaper then I would say worth it but for me I would rather buy a book and supplement with youtube videos if I need a visual. You can usually find something on youtube for just about any topic.,1308614400,9,497,4.1875
3979012,5,B002SATC2C,"this is the second dvd I have gotten fromHomestead blessings and they show easy and thorough techniques with a real love of ""home made""....I will be getting all of their dvd's for help support their efforts.  This is lost arts and deserves to be taught to our children.",1300838400,10,269,4.604166666666667
3979013,2,B002SATC2C,"Although the West ladies are delightful, friendly people, I found this dvd to have very little real information on gardening. I took away from it 2 good ideas, one for planting potatoes and the other for an ""easy instant garden"" but the price is hardly worth it.  If you really want to get your moneys worth, check out Penelope Hobhouse DVD's. Not only are there several hours full of gorgeous gardens to inspire, but a lot of good information for every kind of garden you can imagine.",1297987200,9,485,4.574712643678161
3979014,5,B002SATC2C,"This DVD was interesting to watch, the family of women in this DVD are friendly, and easy to listen to.  This DVD is geared more for the new gardener, great tips for the beginner.  I have been gardening for quite sometime, I found pleasure in hearing the stories of likeminded women, and had a really nice time watching with my teen daughter.  Homestead Blessings Gardening DVD would be a wonderful tool for a homemaking class. I have also purchased the homestead blessings baking DVD which I really enjoyed as well, and I intend to buy some of the other Homestead Blessing DVDs.  I think this series will be a wonderful way to introduce different homemaking skills to my daughter.",1280102400,9,681,4.697478991596639
3979015,5,B002SATC2C,"This is the first of the West Ladies' CDs I've seen, and can't wait to see the others. I've just started gardening, using a few storage containers on my back porch. I've created a compost bin, and have started collecting rain water from my gutters. I SO wish I'd seen this video before I'd planted my lettuce - who knew WOOD ASHES would keep those pesky cabbage loopers away! Next time, Gadget, next time! haha",1277769600,6,410,4.48
3979016,5,B002SATC2C,"I learned so much from this DVD from what I have been doing wrong with my compost pile to growing potatoes in straw. So much good information.

As with all their DVDs, the West Ladies are a joy and I find watching their videos a lovely way to spend an hour (learning a lot is just extra).",1274227200,3,288,4.052631578947368

8379229,5,B002SATC2C,"These ladies are full of kindness and charm. Their herb garden is so lush and amazing! As someone just starting out with gardening I was so intrigued by how they grew their herbs that I wish I could follow them around their garden all day to learn from them. I liked the little tidbits they shared throughout the video on some of the ways they used each herb and what foods they used them in. I loved the easy preparation of the herbs in the recipes that they shared some of which are herbal teas, herbal tonic, herbal vinegar, herbal butter, how to make an herbal brush used to brush on butter, oil, etc., which would be ideal for brushing onto grilled veggies and food (they brushed the melted herbal butter onto cobs of corn). All in all I was impressed and wish they will make another video a sequel of herbs and even veggies and how to grow and use them, it was that enjoyable to me.",1474243200,2,888,4.291666666666667
