7307166,5,B010CG2GEY,"I really enjoyed this. I didn't find any of the individual stories to be too predictable, which is a problem I generally have with horror anthologies.  It's definitely worth your time.",1444608000,,184,4.935483870967742
7307167,5,B010CG2GEY,"If you like independent horror or anthologies, you owe it to yourself to get this.

This is a great little film from the Ohio filmmaker, Henrique Couto. In the vein of Creepshow, this movie has it all, jokes, twists, blood, lighting gels, breasts, and it's an all around good time. Think Creepshow on a shoestring budget that never looks cheap or lazy.

So buy a copy, support independent horror, and remember; my copy was autographed in person and it's okay to be jealous.",1444608000,2,473,4.686746987951807
7307168,5,B010CG2GEY,If you like anthology horror films such as Creepshow or Tails From The Crypt you will enjoy this lasted outing from director Henrique Couto.  Very well acted and visually very well done. You should by this film for the Erin R Ryan pool scene alone. Trust me. Anyways I highly recommend this film.,1444608000,3,296,4.584905660377358
7307169,5,B010CG2GEY,"This was a very fun movie! It's an anthology with a frame story connecting all the vignettes.

The frame story was incredibly great with John Bradley Hambrick as Amos Satan, a late night radio host who is doing a special show for his final night before he goes his way. Hambrick was great as Satan, giving a great feel of radio host.

The vignettes are ""urban legend"" type stories that Satan knows and wants to share with his listeners, instead of the usual taking call-ins from people telling him clichd urban legends.

Each of the vignettes is written by a different author which all give their own unique feel to the movie. All have spot-on comedic moments without trying too hard.

If you enjoy anthologies, I definitely urge you to check this movie out!",1436832000,2,758,4.634328358208955

7307172,1,B010CG2GEY,"I am so annoyed with myself that I paid $5 for this. *shakes fist at high rating* If you love yourself, don't make the same mistake I did. Everything about this movie is bad. Everything.",1446163200,,186,4.3428571428571425
7307173,1,B010CG2GEY,"Stupidly I had a quick glance at the five star ratings and purchased, not seeing the warning sign one star reviews. it's laughably amateurish, like some kind of film school project gone terribly wrong.

7307175,5,B010CG2GEY,"Pretty much a perfect addition to a Halloween movie playlist! Admittedly, I am kind of a wimp, and maybe because of that, the multiple shorter story format appeals to me. Nice, bite-size chunks of spookiness! Gives it a unique feel among other horror films.",1445904000,,257,4.863636363636363
7307176,5,B010CG2GEY,"This is my favorite film to date from this director. As a low budget Indie movie, you're not going to get the Hollywood effects, eye candy and fluff. What you will get is a good short story film anthology. I didn't feel bored, this film kept me entertained. I enjoy horror flicks without all the CGI and expensive effects. It lends more to the imagination and feels less 'made up', making the film a little scarier to me! Interesting ending, didn't see that coming. I've watched this movie several times. I think for the low budget category, it's an excellent film.",1445817600,,565,4.603960396039604

7307178,5,B010CG2GEY,"To start i absolutely loved this movie. A lot of times when i watch ""micro budget"" indie movies its almost a chore trying to get through it. Not the case with scarewaves. I enjoyed this movie straight though. If you read the description you know the premise. A radio host by the name amos satan tells 4 spooky tales on his last night on the radio. Im a fan of anthology films so this already appealed to me and i really liked the idea of the stories being tied together by the radio host as apposed to just showing them separately. Each tale being told had a lesson to be learned and each was entertaining in its own right. The shining star of the film for me was the actor who played amos satan. My guess is he actually works in radio because he absolutely nailed this part. He also had his own story in between the telling of the storys. If i had one complaint it would be that i wish more was done with this story. Not because the movie really needed it more so because i was so impressed with amos satans character that i really wanted to see more of him onscreen. I would definitely recommend this movie and i know ill be watching it again.",1445731200,,1145,4.209090909090909
7307179,5,B010CG2GEY,"Scarewaves is a low budget scream of a good time. Fun flicks, a rad wrap around, and just an anthology the cryptkeeper would be proud of.",1445731200,3,137,4.3076923076923075
7307193,1,B010CG2GEY,"Perhaps you're a big horror fan like me and you see this movie listed with cool cover art and decent reviews, so you think it's worth checking out. Pro tip: don't. This is a micro budget anthology horror film with atrocious acting and pathetically boring stories. The movie looks like it was shot on a 1999 handicam. The stories are boring and pointless. There's legitimately nothing good about this movie. The 5 star reviews are clearly made by friends and members of the cast and crew. Save your money and time and pass on this junk.

Edit: Notice how many of the reviews are written by ""Amazon Customer"". Thank goodness fake reviews are going to be punished by Amazon soon. It's one thing to promote your movie but another to write disingenuous reviews to make it look like something it's not and fool people into watching it.",1445644800,5,829,4.639455782312925
7307194,1,B010CG2GEY,"This movie was terrible! Horrible acting, unimaginative storylines... Those who gave this movie 5 stars must be connected with the movie or were paid for a good review. No way in hell was this movie anything more than one star, if even that.",1445644800,8,241,4.627906976744186
7307195,1,B010CG2GEY,Can't understand how anyone would think the acting in this movie is any good. It's so terrible that I couldn't even finish watching it. The stories are really really stupid. Stupid movie. Can't give it only 1/2 a star but I would.,1445558400,8,230,4.5

7307197,5,B010CG2GEY,"I can hear the crypt keeper's blood curdling laugh, and saying, ""Good evening, kiddies!"". Three really good horror stories that weren't actually that scary, but funny in parts and not a bad script. I won't summarize, but if you are a fan of the old HBO series ""Tales From the Crypt"", you might enjoy them",1445299200,2,304,4.545454545454546
7307198,5,B010CG2GEY,"I absolutely love this movie!! As an avid comic book collector with a special, warm and fuzzy place for horror anthologies (such as Vault of Horror, The Witching Hour, Tales from the Crypt), I am well-aware that it's rare to find an anthology with exclusively awesome stories... Every segment is fantastic. This movie has it all: intrigue, striking images, and terrifying twists all wrapped up by a fast-talking, charismatic jokester. Henrique Couto never disappoints with his fascinating characters... bad-ass female leads included, Scarewaves is a truly feminist movie of the horror genre.",1445212800,2,591,5.434782608695652
7307199,5,B010CG2GEY,"A great horror anthology is really hard to come by in modern times.  Especially today.  Scarewaves is an ode to classic horror anthologies like Creepshow and Tales from the Darkside.  The different segments are all rather varied covering a wide mixture of stories.  Ranging from crime drama to hauntings.  Along with a wickedly game cast, director Henrique Couto makes a solid entry in the anthology sub-genre.  High recommend for those who support independent cinema.",1445126400,3,468,5.256756756756757

Amazon should only allow verified purchasers to rate these movies.  Not worth the money or the effort.",1445126400,6,293,4.938775510204081

7307202,5,B010CG2GEY,"Amos Satan has some stories he would like to share with you...Tune in to Scarewaves. I had the opportunity of seeing the premiere of Scarewaves and was blown away by how fun and scary it was. One of the new films from director Henrique Couto has him going back to his horror roots and he takes no prisoners. Like the trailer says it's Creepshow meets Talk Radio, as we're told 4 stories with a wrap around by mysterious macabre DJ Amos Satan. With stories of Supernatural revenge, psychotic artists, demons, killer anticipation, and a haunting past that eventually catches up with someone, its wild ride as each story becomes scarier than the last. Henrique transports you to an almost EC Comic like environment not sparing the blood and boobs either. With some superb writing from various writers, amazing acting from very talented people, and excellent direction by Couto, Scarewaves is guaranteed macabre fun just in time for its October and Halloween release. So pop some popcorn, turn off the lights, and tune in for whats sure to be a regular add on every year for your Halloween line up. This is Scarewaves!",1444867200,,1114,4.807291666666667

Anyone who ever watched a whole season of TALES FROM THE DARK SIDE has seen everyone of these stories only with better acting, writing, and production values.  Keep in mind that TALES FROM THE DARK SIDE was the worst horror anthology series on television.  Different stories share the same set.  The women are all trying to act their way out of the strip club, but they won't make it.  I've seen wedding videos with better photography.  Do not waste your money or your time on this garbage.  I suspect the positive reviews were written by people involved in the production of this film and people they paid to boost their rating.
