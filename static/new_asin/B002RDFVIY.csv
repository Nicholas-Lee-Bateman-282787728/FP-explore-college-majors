3973797,3,B002RDFVIY,"Not bad considering ....  I bought the movie from some young ladies in a mall in KC, didn't expect much considering I've never purchased a movie this way.  Finally watched it (2 yrs later) and found the acting, production, and story acceptable and interesting. Its a fair effort at making a movie, I've seen worse.",1416960000,,314,4.6909090909090905

3973799,1,B002RDFVIY,"If there were an option to give tis movie 0 stars, I would. I bought this movie from a girl selling them in the parking lot of TJ MAXX in Montgomery, AL. She claimed to be one of the girls in the movie. She's not in the movie.

This movie is entirely too dark. The ""acting"" is horrendous and overall the ""mocvie""...if that's what you want to call it, sucks.",1398816000,5,357,4.1
3973800,2,B002RDFVIY,From bad acting too bad lighting to bed dialogue overall I still gave this movie two stars. The young lady in the mall pushing these DVDs said she was one of the actresses on the back of the cover so that they were trying to make it to some upcoming film festival so I give them one star for effort having the ability to appeal their dreams. I gave it a second star because I didn't fall asleep it will send my entertaining. I'm only out of eight dollars so not too bad,1388620800,4,469,4.053763440860215
3973801,1,B002RDFVIY,"I love B-rated films some are very good. But this really wasn't a film it was more like a documentary. The bad lighting made it hard for me to watch and after falling asleep on it numerous time, I gave up. I also believe the filmmaker could have done a better job at telling Corry D. Coats Sr. story.",1375660800,3,300,4.101694915254237
3973802,1,B002RDFVIY,"I met a girl in a lot selling the film and because I'm a filmmaker, I supported... I asked her ""Is this a good film?""  THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM!!! Me and my people lasted 10 mins watching this BS! Bad acting, Too many N-Words, bad lighting, bad accent on this Jamacian dude, sound sucks, music over dialogue! I now see why it's so hard for me to get black folks to watch my films because of BS like this! Stop messing up the film industry for talented people!",1343952000,13,458,4.088888888888889
8378656,1,B002RDFVIY,"Teardrops is a 1990s/2000s interpretation of starting out in the entertainment industry. Its evident how performing can impact communities, providing management, singing, dancing, stepping, rapping, modeling, acting and teamwork skills for multiple generations. Though the story is inspiring, the movie does predominately show African Americans having a path to success through entertainment rather than other more lucrative, spiritual fulfilling or mentally stimulating careers. This movie is similar to an extended music video with a more complex story line, showing the ups and downs of performers in their every day lives. The camera skills are okay, some frames clearer and more focused than others.",1527465600,,704,5.844660194174757
8378657,1,B002RDFVIY,Worse movie I ever saw. Bought it from a girl on a parking lot she also told us that she was in the movie. The editing as well as the acting was terrible. This is not a good movie. I love to support our people but this was terrible. I feel cheated out of my $10. I wish I could of given it no stars.,1527379200,,299,3.6153846153846154

8378659,1,B002RDFVIY,"This was a complete waste of time. I don't even know what the point of the story was. It was just  a whole bunch of rambling with  bad cut scenes, bad lighting, bad dialogue ,bad audio it was just terrible. The $10 I spent is not the reason I'm  mad because I like to support independent artists. It was fact that it was just terrible. I know this is supposed to be based on a true story as well. I even tried to Google the actual group just to see if I can get some understanding of what this movie was about and  I can't even find anything about them on the Internet!",1508889600,,569,4.008849557522124
8378660,1,B002RDFVIY,"Bought it like everyone else here seemed to have gotten it, from a woman in a parking lot. I want to find her and pay her 10 bucks to take it back! I would say it's a bad movie if I could have actually stayed awake to see it, but from the little I did see, how is it that this guy has a woman thats younger than him playing his mother?",1493078400,,335,3.6666666666666665

8378663,1,B002RDFVIY,"If you bought this movie from a young woman in a parking lot in [INSERT CITY HERE], then you got robbed. It's a hustle, and we are the marks.

Don't watch this movie. Don't buy this movie. This movie is horrendous. Absolutely terrible in every way possible. Spherically horrible. I am putting more effort into this review than this man put into his entire film.

The first warning should be when you start watching, and the menu is a basic Windows Movie Maker backdrop, and the movie is mis-spelled as 'TEARRDROPZ'. If that doesn't deter you, then you're in for the worst ride of your life.

The cameraman should be under a court order to stay 100 feet from any camera. The footage is both grainy and washed out, often at the same time, and the way the camera moves only adds to the confusion. There are several scenes where the subject moves completely out of frame, only for the camera to pan back over to him again. Subjects are either too close or moving too fast, or out of focus, or have no look space and end up facing the end of the frame. Seriously, no forethought or effort.

As for the post editing, the cuts between scenes make no sense whatsoever. We go from young man with a family life, to running from drug pushers, to calling his mom, to being famous, to promoting his business, to starting his business. Did I wind up in some fucked-up creepy version of 'Memento'? Who got paid for this?!

The script and the dialog cannot be worse. It really cannot. Everyone is this lifeless, two-dimensional caricature. And that's if the characters are even getting lines. The narration continuously gives the film-maker a reason to just have people do things onscreen with no sense, such as in the infamous 'limo booty dancer' scene. What is our story? What are we supposed to feel with this story? What is our conflict? It misses the mark in every sense. And it jumps around from place to place in ways that leave me completely in awe of how horrible it is.

I am literally drained from being angry at this movie. I am undone. When the first snows fall, I will take this DVD outside and light it on fire, then spread its ashes amongst the snow.

In summary, the following people can go duck themselves:

Yosiah Morrow - Director and Writer. You cannot call yourself either of these two things. Evaluate your life.

Corry Coats Sr. - Producer and Actor. If you are this one-dimensional in real life, I hope you end up financially bankrupt. You are already morally bankrupt, so it's not far.

Darius Wallace, Review on the back of the case - ""Very entertaining and high energy"" isn't even a proper sentence. What the duck?",1448150400,7,2626,4.53276955602537
