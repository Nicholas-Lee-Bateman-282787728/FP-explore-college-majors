8642182,5,B00II5Q7TM,"Mia and Me: Season 1 Volume 1, the Italian uncut version is good. Rosabell, who plays the role as Mia receives a book and a bracelet. What's inside?

Well basically this PAL DVD includes the first 6 episodes from its debut season, somehow that's 3 more than the upcoming Region 1 release two months away. That makes the total runtime of over 2 hours, and that's good to see more fairytales and adventures with your kids even though these episodes are in Italian, aspect ratio is Widescreen.",1424908800,3,490,4.632183908045977
