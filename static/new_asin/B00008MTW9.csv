1853000,5,B00008MTW9,"In this Installment of the InuYasha series on dvd we finish the fight with the Thunder Brothers(Hiten and Manten).  In this episode InuYasha's feelings for Kagome become obvious for those who haven't seen it coming yet.
Next are the two episodes most people I talk to dislike because they don't really have much to do in the overall story(I prefer to think of them as character building episodes).
First, an evil fleshing eating mask is devouring everything in sight so it may have a body.  Kagome becomes a target when the mask realizes it need jewel shards to keep the body it gained.  InuYasha comes in the nick of time but refuses to save her until she apologizes for making him sit many times for trying to plug up the well.
After that Kagome must save a little girl's spirit from the pits of hell after she rages against its family for letting her die.  This, too, annoys InuYasha because he couldn't help Kagome and was worried.
A word of warning for collectors of this series:  If you liked what you saw on Cartoon Network and began collecting this series but don't know much else about it, you should know that it is 90+ episodes long and you will only get three episodes a dvd.",1051920000,6,1187,4.502325581395349

1853002,5,B00008MTW9,"The disc opens with the 2nd half of the Thunder Bros fight including a dream Manten has of having hair attracting loads of pretty girls that I don't recall from the Cartoon Network cut. I enjoy the theme which Cartoon Network also removed.  The art on this show is beautiful & the characters are developing nicely--after 12 eps they have progressed from what they were when we met them & Shippo is a cute addition. I thought it was cute in the Japanese track to the Ghost Girl that Soto accused InuYasha of being smitten with Kagome--particularly considering InuYasha seemed a bit more vicious(sincere in his threats?) when they first met & he wanted the Jewel or else per the subtitles.
The worst part is only 3 eps per dvd & the wait in-between releases.",1047081600,2,756,4.6

7985550,5,B00008MTW9,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

The fight with the Thunder Brothers comes to an end, and Shippo decides to tag along with the 2 heroes. Kagome goes back to her time and encounters demons there as well. The demon puts her family in danger. Inuyasha must come to her rescue.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353196800,,1386,4.347490347490347
7985551,4,B00008MTW9,"In Episode 10, Inuyasha, Kagome, and Shippo have their final battle with the Thunder Brothers. The other two episodes are a change of pace because both mainly feature adventures of Kagome in the contemporary world, with Inuyasha only showing up in bit parts. In Episode 11, when Kagome brings the Shikon shards back to contemporary Tokyo, they activate an ancient Noh Mask whose main goal is to devour human flesh! And it wants the jewel so it can have a body of its own. In the last episode, again set in the present, the vengeful spirit of a little girl is determined to do evil upon the human world. It's up to Kagome to rescue her from eternal damnation before it's too late.

As always, the animation for this series is first rate. The last episode was especially affecting. Even the comical character of Shippo is fighting out of love for his father, who was brutally killed by the Thunder Brothers. You really care about these characters because they have all the vulnerabilities of real people. And we're starting to get the first hints that the antagonism between Inuyasha and Kagome is actually the mask for a deeper feeling.

 A line-art gallery is the only extra here, but the skimpy extras are expected now.",1121904000,,1220,4.691588785046729

7985553,4,B00008MTW9,"Episode 10 - Phantom Showdown: The Thunder Brothers vs. Tetsusaiga

The conclusion of the battle with the Thunder Brothers.  Their family history is revealed.  The more human-looking Hiten is more evil than his uglier brother, Manten.  Taking a pause in using their thunder powers to wipe out samurai armies for sport, the brothers are trying to get the Sacred Jewel shards from Inuyasha and his friends.  As Manten is choking Kagome to death, Inuyasha kills him.  Even though Hiten is so vile, it is touching to see his genuine grief as he has lost the only person he had in the world.

Episode 11 - Terror of the Ancient Noh Mask

This episode is terrifying.  Kagome is back in present-day Japan, trying to catch up with her schoolwork and her friends.  But an ancient Noh mask sealed in a box in the temple senses the Sacred Jewel shards in Kagome's room.  The mask breaks free and goes around killing people in the most horrible way imagined.

Episode 12 - Soul Piper and the Mischievous Little Soul

This episode is both scary and difficult to watch.  This episode is in no way for children.  It deals with the very vengeful ghost of a little girl who perished in a house fire.  The ghost is actively trying to kill her little brother.  She actually throws the sick boy through a glass hospital window.  Close behind the ghost is the Soul Piper, a being who escorts the ghosts of children to heaven.  This benevolent, ocarina-playing spirit can become VERY scary very quickly, as it is also his job to drag evil children to hell.  Kagome, with her psychic gifts, wants to turn the girl's heart around before it is too late.  You will have a lump in your throat when you see the goldfish kimono.",1093824000,4,1699,4.559602649006623
7985554,4,B00008MTW9,"This is a pretty enjoyable series overall.  This was the first anime show I ever saw (mostly by accident) on Adult Swim on the cartoon network.  It had action, adventure, and comedy and was really fun to watch.  These are three pretty good episodes, not the best but not the worst either.  The only reason I gave it for stars is because 1.) It's really too expensive for three 20 minute episodes.  and 2.) It will probably be the only dvd of the series I buy because it's too expensive and there will probably be like 200 dvds, if not more and 3.) It's too freaking expensive.
But if you want something that involves a present day girl from Japan being sucked down a well into Fuedal Japan times and fighting with a demon dog guy, a warrior girl, a lecherous monk, a fox guy who has a feminine voice, a flea man, and varius other weird people as they fight Naraku (sp?) and he's minions, and laugh as Kigome (sp?!) fights to survive in that world as well as her own, then well...at least check it out on Adult Swim before buying this extremely high priced dvds.",1089244800,,1061,4.338383838383838
