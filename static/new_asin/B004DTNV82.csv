4334698,4,B004DTNV82,"Just a few comments in the realm of things you didn't notice the first time:

*that field was one of the key story lines in the game.  Again and again, from the opening kickoff, players would slip and slide.  It was dangerous at times and surely cut down on the explosiveness of the game.  There was never an adequate explanation as to what was going on, but it wasn't a field suitable for a championship game.

*being blunt here, neither QB put up a very good game.  Newton played perhaps his worst game of the entire year, off-target on many throws and missing open receivers, including a couple for easy touchdowns.  It seemed like the vast majority of his throws were the 1 yard sideline variety too, and you could tell he was hurt.  Course, the Oregon QB had a far worse game, in part because he was getting clocked every so often, but his accuracy was terrible.  You had to figure the long layoff really impacted both players.

*it is a miracle and a testament to how good Oregon was that they were even in a position to win the game.  You never got the feeling from watching this almost from minute one that Oregon had better athletes - they didn't.  Yet, they still had a real chance of winning the game.

*for those who watched Auburn all year, you had to wonder how that defense became as dominant as they did.  Either that, or something was very badly wrong with Oregon's offensive scheme because at times they would allow Auburn lineman to come in completely untouched.  These weren't bad blocks - they were no blocks.  What sense is there in that?  I know the head coach is a genius and all and had some wonderful trick plays but something was definitely off, wasn't it?

*lastly, even as an Auburn fan, the ending was borderline shocking.  Granted, you had to sense that Dyer could run at will at times but who knows what really would have happened in that last drive without that - well - lucky but extremely athletic play.

On the extras, you get the trophy presentation and the post-game Auburn press conference.  Wasn't much.",1298851200,8,2043,4.497282608695652
4334699,4,B004DTNV82,"well, if you're thinking of buying this, then you've probably already seen this & possibly still have it on your DVR. the whole game aired by ESPN is here, minus commercial breaks, plus some postgame coverage as well. one gripe some people might have is that it's fairly auburn-biased, and the front cover certainly is a tip-off to that. i know auburn won, but oregon fans sitting on the fence might be reluctant to buy the DVD for that reason. another small gripe is that some alternate audio broadcast tracks (particularily the auburn & oregon radio networks) would've been a nice feature. be that as it may, it's a worthy enough purchase for the price.....",1297468800,8,659,4.739130434782608

8426073,4,B004DTNV82,"Unlike this year's disappointing LSU-Bama blowout, the clash between Oregon and Auburn was a nailbiter. Duck fans won't mind reliving the game, and closely examining that knee-not-down call that cost them the game. Ducks got revenge in the Rose Bowl this year so justice has been done.",1326412800,,285,5.085106382978723

The quality was exceptional and the sound was great.  They covered all the instant replays and reviews.  They didn't skip a beat.  Even though I knew the outcome long before recieving the DVD, I still felt the drama watching the game.  I got it in a timely fashion as well.",1301270400,5,426,4.341772151898734

The tape got here and dad had already passed didn't know he was that terrible ill.  Thought about sending back but my brother is a big auburn fan said to keep it.  That he would like to have it as a rememberence of dad, and he is thrilled how good the tape is. Thank-you Freda",1300665600,3,420,3.86046511627907
