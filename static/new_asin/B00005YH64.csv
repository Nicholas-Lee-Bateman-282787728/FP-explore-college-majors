8316121,5,B00005YH64,"From the Award Winning Producer of ""A Tribute to Tuna"" comes the most in-depth and informative video ever produced on fishing for World Record Tuna.

Rarely does a sequel come close to capturing the excitement and thrill of the original, but as Marlin, The International Sportfishing Magazine, writes, ""Michael Fowlkes has created a masterpiece.""

With rare, archival footage of the first long range trips, and an exclusive interview with Michael Farrior, of the Avalon Tuna Club, A Tribute to Tuna II, takes us through the evolution of long range fishing, from 8' tuna sticks, leather harnesses and 9/0, to the development of Shimano's state-of-the-art hydrothermal drag systems and T-bar handles.

Tommy Rothery of the Polaris Supreme, Toyo Shimano and Norm Taniguchi then team-up to cover every aspect of how to properly use today's stand-up tackle and equipment.
