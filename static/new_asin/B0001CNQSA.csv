1987177,1,B0001CNQSA,"Compulsive Behaviour Disorder is another one of those sadly misunderstood forms of mental illness which can affect anyone at any time during their life. It can range from the repeated washing of hands to the complete opposite end of the scale, in other words self harm or self mutilation. It takes a special kind of Sicko to make a very nasty film like this and to actually attempt to pass it off as a piece of high brow cinematic art!!! This DVD was given to me on someones, recommendation !!  The portrayal of what this character goes through during the film came across as voyeuristic and vomit inducing!! And it constantly pretends to be highly creative and artistic!!! We are never once given a deep look into the unfortunate victims mind, instead, we are just pushed along from one piece of gore to the next!! And trust me when I say that this IS NOT the sort of film you should be leaving lying around for children to see!!! Let alone anyone actually suffering from this nasty illness! It should be hoped that Marina De Van quietly vanishes into a very dark corner somewhere never to be heard of again!!!",1107302400,3,1111,4.555
1987178,4,B0001CNQSA,"I found this dvd by chance at one of my local rental stores. It was the only copy in the entire place, and with reading the back, I was compelled to buy it, even with the english subtitles lol.

I found that In My Skin wasn't as good as it could have been, but at the same time you rarely see anything on Self-Injury. Esther, a girl who looks to have her life on track accidently injures herself while at a friends party. When questioned about why she didn't know she was injured, she responds that she didn't feel it. From here on in, things escalate and lead to some very serious acts of SI. I agree with the others, that they left you wondering as to why exactly Esther started going over board with her self-injury anyways. There were a couple other things that could have been done to enhance the story line - such as more concern shown by Esther's boyfriend Vincent

All in all, the visuals in this movie helped to accurately portray the acts of self-harm and the catatonic fits that some actually do go into. As was said, it is unrated but should be rated R for the graphic nature and nudity.

I reccomend this to anyone who wants to take a closer look at EXTREME cases of Self-Injury, as long as you have a strong stomach.",1103932800,2,1230,4.293103448275862
1987179,5,B0001CNQSA,"Ok I have never written a review before, so this is a first for me, bear with me.  This is an amazing film.  I had to watch it twice at first to really get it.

At first glance it is a bizzare horror flick.  But on a second viewing I realized this was all about the main character trying to find her place.  Her place in her life, her place in society, her place even in regular conversation.

The film had to be graphic inorder to convey the meaning behind the character.  And since the director is also the main character, then this becomes necessary for the film to work.  I say this coment about the graphic nature to the film, because at first viewing it really seemed like just a cheap shot to make one squemish....but it's not.

Anyway another more recent film to check out is 'The Mother'.  It is different in tons of ways, but it relates in that it is about a woman's struggle dealing with everyday life.  Nothing hollywood here, really the gritty reality of life.  These are films to ponder over, give a little thought and move on.

I almost truely believe that these kind of films are the ones that really mean the most to people in general.  It's a shame that Hollywood abuses the film-making process and shadows our intellect.  But keep in mind this is someone who is obsessed with the Oscars.  So never mind.",1102636800,3,1322,4.35655737704918
1987180,4,B0001CNQSA,"I remember seeing the trailer for IN MY SKIN in the theatre several months ago and there was an immediate audience reaction to the frank scenes of a woman engaging in acts of self-mutilation, myself included. In spite of my initial whimpering there I was curious about this film, as this is a rare subject matter and sensitive topic to portray. For this reason I decided to rent the DVD to see more about this woman with the tendency to cut herself.
Esther (Marina de Van) is an ambitious career woman with an enduring boyfriend who appears to have everything going for her. While attending a party she accidentally trips in a darkened yard and suffers a serious cut on her calf. One would think that a person who receives such a similar injury would feel the pain immediately and seek out some assistance. Esther, however, only believes that her pants were torn and continues to enjoy the party until she witnesses her trail of blood. Both her doctor and boyfriend are stunned over Esther's lack of feeling for good reasons.
As time progresses Esther realizes that she is strangely soothed by aspect of cutting herself and engages in such behavior behind the backs of others. She continuously feels compelled to harm herself and often hides in public places while taking a sharp object to an appendage of her body. She quickly slides down a downward spiral of aberrant conduct.
An obvious question is why Esther is mutilating herself while risking both her relationship and career. Unfortunately there are no clear answers. Cutting is a serious psychological disorder that is often an outlet for feelings of low self-esteem and lack of control over present circumstances, but Esther's situation remains vague. It was only watching the director's commentary that I received some clarity and insight, and in the fashion of French cinema the relationship of Esther to her body is largely philosophical.
IN MY SKIN is certainly not for everyone due to the numerous blatant scenes of self-mutilation. Its lack of clarity can be annoying and grating and as a result I would definitely recommend watching the director's commentary afterwards to better appreciate this film. 3.5 stars.",1083801600,11,2178,4.953551912568306
1987201,3,B0001CNQSA,"Here's one for all you kids who think self-mutilation is the thing to do.  If you give this one a watch, you'll be treated to the sight of writer/director/star Marina de Van cutting into her arm like it's a piece of fresh steak, rubbing the blood all over her face, and sucking at her wound like a vampire.

Ever since scatterbrained advertising exec Esther accidentally falls onto a sharp metal instrument while wandering around outside drunk at a party, she feels the ""mindless urge,"" as she calls it, to cut herself, much to the bewilderment of her friends and colleagues.  She engages in increasingly serious acts of self-mutilation, even going so far as to preserving little pieces of skin in a formaldahyde-filled jar.

OK, if you think this is going to be some boring movie-of-week, think again.  This is a horror movie, plain and simple.  The cutting scenes are necessarily harsh and realistic.  There's nothing pretty about seeing an increasingly pale and unhealthy-looking Marina de Van waking up from an all-night cutting binge, covered in crusty and dried blood.

Overall, a subtle and understated movie, reminiscent of David Cronenberg's 'Crash'...nothing too exceptional, but well worth at least a rental.",1213315200,,1219,5.090452261306533

But she had some dark unique beauty in her that is hard for me to explain perfectly. That dark unique beauty trancends even more in her own film In my skin. Yes it's a very disturbing film and you're honestly not given an exact reason why she's into cutting herself. It's all ambiguous. But one thing for sure is that it'll keep you in your seat because you need to see the outcome of this film which in the end leaves you wondering. I'd personally loved it and thought it was way better than Trouble everyday and even The piano teacher. Check it out!,1141084800,3,697,4.208955223880597
1987207,4,B0001CNQSA,"This story of an ordinary woman's descent into madness truly shocks. Although this is no exploitation flick, and if you want just to watch something really nasty, don't bother - this one is not only a film of gore. Of course it's quite disturbing (but I bet you've seen much more disturbing ones), but generally it's a food for thought. Here it's not only cutting and flesh-gnawing that's important, but a clash of Esther and society. We see how difficult is to deal with other people when you have a slight, so to say, deviation. And on the other hand how hard is to communicate with someone who has this deviation. As soon as Esther acquires this strange habit of cutting herself, her relations with her fiance and with colleagues deteriorate very quickly, and Marina De Van asks us (maybe asking herself at the same time): is society wrong not accepting some weird manifestations of a person? Or is this person wrong? Is Esther insane? Or is it just an innocent devotion of hers? You'll have to answer all these questions yourself which is rather difficult, because De Van doesn't give us any clues. Maybe it's good she doesn't tell us what to think. The ending is pretty obscure and ambiguous, personally I don't know what to think yet. But it's not the first movie about European society, happy and decent from the outside, disturbed and distorted inside. Maybe we'd want to see some tendency here.

People wish to devour themselves and other people - there's much to think here about. Probably ""In My Skin"" would remind you of ""Trouble Every Day"" with Vincent Gallo, they are pretty much the same. Some will recall Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"". Anyway, if you like really dark, disturbing and thoughtful pictures (the majority of which is European, as it appeares lately), you'll like this one too. It's rather slow and sleepy, but maybe for a reason.",1137542400,3,1857,4.767080745341615
1987208,3,B0001CNQSA,"Dans ma Peau (Marina de Van, 2002)

There is a short list of films that are revered by connoisseurs of the extreme. Whenever two or more are gathere in one place and talking about their favorite films, you're sure to hear a number of the same names coming up. August Underground. Men Behind the Sun. Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood. Ichi the Killer. Etc. When Dans ma Peau started coming up on a regular basis, I decided I had no choice but to see it.

The story concerns Esther (writer/director Marina de Van, recently of See the Sea and The Sister Brothers), an up-and-coming research analyst who, one night at a party, falls while walking and gashes her leg deeply on a construction tool. She spends the next few hours at the party not realizing she's been injured, and as a result of this, she becomes fascinated with wounds and their associated pain, to the point where she begins cutting herself. This, understandably, alienates her boyfriend Vincent (Laurent Lucas of Who Killed Bambi? Fame) and best friend Sandrine (Lea Drucker, recently seen in Chaos).

What Dans ma Peau does best is raise the idea of ambiguity. Is Sandrine pulling away from Esther because Esther is cutting herself, or because Esther got a promotion Sandrine assumed she'd get? (And, perhaps more to the point, did Esther get that promotion because of the renewed self-confidence she gained when she began cutting?) Is Vincent's relationship with Esther disintegrating because of the cutting, or simply because it's always been stormy, and the two really have nothing in common? And, for the love of all that's holy, what happens five minutes after the end of the film?

The distress that there is to be felt in Dans ma Peau comes mostly from de Van's ambiguous attitude towards cutting. Don't get me wrong here, I'm not transferring from character to director; it's quite obvious throughout how Esther feels about it. It's the ambiguity raised in almost every aspect of this film that leads me to question de Van's take on the whole idea. The obvious answer is that cutting, here, is treated like an extremely addictive drug, complete with withdrawal hallucinations (the restaurant scene will have a morbid, wonderful humor to it for anyone who's suffered through, any filmed depiction of withdrawal), but the ending-- or rather, where de Van chooses to place the ending in the story-- shoots the film's anti-cutting message (if indeed it exists) quite solidly in the foot. More than that cannot be said without spoilers, but at the very least, it may even lead you to wonder whether de Van played the role with far less in the way of special effects than one would otherwise assume.

I wasn't terribly disturbed by it myself, but then cutting has always held a deep attraction for me. I'd probably have felt better about it had the final scene held even a clue to what was about to happen to Esther, but at the very least, the movie is watchable in that extraordinarily-gruesome-car-accident sort of way; once you've started watching, only sheer disgust is likely to tear you away. ***",1132012800,6,3075,4.805293005671078
1987209,4,B0001CNQSA,"Looking at the reviews, the average reader may decide that this movie sounds harsh, but surely nothing too bad.  Trust me, It really IS that harsh.  If you cannot stomach pain, blood, etc., then In My Skin isn't for you.  I'm not talking about Hollywood violence here; the scenes in this film look very real and are therefore more disturbing.  That being said....

This movie does an excellent job pulling the viewer into the main character's (Esther) world.  She really is a tragic character, a (highly) updated Ophelia for the modern viewer.  As bits of her life have the possiblilty of coming together (new apartment, successful boyfriend, job promotion) things simultaneously begins to fall apart.  Like a wound that quickly turns to gangrene, her initial gash soon engulfs her body and emotions.  As you watch her descent, scene after scene unfolds where you wish that there was some way to stop her.  Yet Esther is moving too quickly as she begins to uncover the deep-seated tendencies that lead to her ultimate undoing.

Who would like this film?  I would guess that fans of psychodrama, feminist film, and experimental film may find a lot of worthwhile material here.  If you enjoy the films of Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher) or even Maya Deren's ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" will likely see some interesting resonances.

My bottom line opinion:  if you can handle extremely realistic and graphic scenes showing self-inflicted violence and mental illness, and are interested in highly personal / psychodrama, then this is a worthwhile film to see.",1114819200,15,1556,5.0
1987210,3,B0001CNQSA,"OK. I watch a lot of movies and after viewing this, I can can honestly say that this is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. That's not why I give it 3 stars, i'll get into that in a moment. But the scenes in the film are so graphic and real looking, it was freaky even for me and i'm not a really squeamish person. While watching these scenes I had one thing running through my mind: ""Holy sh*t"". There are scenes I believe between 5 & 10 minutes long of her just cutting herself and then eating her own skin. And I swear, for a french movie that was most likely made on a very low budget, these scenes are very realistic. Anyway, when I lived in California, a little magazine was included with the paper every Thursday and it happens to contain film reviews. This one was there with I think a C-. I decided to read it and read about how a woman mutilates herself and then eats her skin. Now, I have a relatively sick mind, so this sounded fascinating to me. Marina de Van writes, directs, and stars as Esther. Esther is at a party and while walking through the back yard, she apparently cuts herself on a piece of metal. This cut she recieves looks just as real as the rest of the movie and she seems fascinated by it. Eventually she starts cutting herself. Then cutting and eating. Then cutting, eating, and saving pieces of skin. Even to me, this was disturbing and I had to look away a few times. But even with this very effective story, the movie falls short. This is caused for a few reasons. For one, and this doesn't play a large role in the films ""notthatgoodness"" but de Van looks freaky OK? Not because she's cutting her self, but just her face. OK? For one, her teeth are all about 6 inches long. That's exaggerating, but still. She just came off as weird-looking. The scenes I mentioned earlier with her cutting herself and nothing more, are truly terrific effective scenes. But after a while it seems we are watching the same thing over and over again. But her romance with her boyfriend is crap. The two have no charisma whatsoever.

And the rest of the story just didn't click. It ended perfectly. Although I began to fall asleep towards the end (not becuz the movie sucked, I was just tired) I think that it ended with a closeup on her face. I don't remember if she was dead or not, but if she was or not just that close up on her face, kind of sums up the movie for me. C. If u know if she was dead or not,

8010020,4,B0001CNQSA,These are my favourite kind of films. This film is perfect. It keeps you confused threout which for me keeps me interested. The gore is subconscious so you do t really see it as much as you feel it. The actress isn't the most beautiful woman and in this case it helps the realism of the film come to life.  I'd recommend this film to any horror fan.  The only thing I would of changed is I would of made some scenes more gory.,1492387200,,426,4.059523809523809

I own around 4,000 dvds and blurays and probably have seen around I don't know over 50,000 movies in my life but nothing this painful to watch. So real and painful I almost about to vomit and felt so sorry for this woman and also felt guilty watching this film at the same time.
This movie definately reminded me of another filmmaker David Cronenberg and you will have more idea if you hear his name.
It's about this woman, a skinny woman who is having her peak in her career at her work had an injury in the dark being tricked by a bunch of construction place. She injured one leg real bad that she had to sew a lot of times.
Seeing that, her boyfriend freaked out.

Moreover she did strange thing to it. She uncovered the bandage and the wound was in a real bad condition. It was really painful to look.

From then on, she enjoys self torturing her leg real bad.
She goes to a hotel and freely, even tears apart her skin and eats part of it. She is in a really bad condition.
To cover up, she rolls her car to the edge of the street and pretends that she had a car accident. Her boyfriend and cops bought it.

It is called self-mutilation what she is doing.
She had problem with communication before.
She just didn't knew it  before. She just happens to find an exit which is doing this thing to her body.

By the time when she was promoted and had this meeting with important client, her one arm was numb. I think it has something to do with her leg injury. Maybe it's a mental thing. She poked her arm with a folk and the blood came out.

So why are we watching this movie?
We sometimes see movies because we see it something we cannot experience in real life. We are experiencing through the movie.
I can never do it to my body that this woman did to her's. I rather end my life simply when I cannot stand my life anymore then tear apart my skin and drink my blood just like this woman did.

When she awoke even the part of her skin were all over the ground. I really couldn's stand it. But for some how I did watch through the end.

There is this scene with a split screen- two screen in one -when this woman is again self-injuring with a knife, this time really really bad, when she put a knife really close to her eye, I was amost couldn't breath.
Is this art? This movie also reminded of <SEVEN>.
She took all the picute of her skin and she wanted to stuff her took out skin part.

The ending seems unending.

We were left speecheless.

What can I say.

It was a strange morbid movie that many people will be walk out during watching.

8010022,5,B0001CNQSA,"Another Warning! My Brief Thematic Evaluation contains Heavy Spoilers....

Drawing from the feminist liberation ideology found in the early paranoia pictures of Roman Polanski-- especially Repulsion-- In My Skin is a highly literate exercise in draining, existentialist horror.

In the film, the main character of Esther leads a detached life from society. She can't function and connect to any human in this male-dominated, capitalist world. So withdrawn Esther is that when it comes time to talk business in a pivotal diner scene-- the one scene that comes from dreamlike paranoia, not earthbound horror-- she literally imagines one of her limbs detached during the discourse, and thus continues the love affair with self-mutilation.

And a love story it is indeed. Yet, instead of with another human being it is with tearing apart her own body, of which can be perceived as the very faulty foundation for worth and self-purpose in a society that sadly values feminine attractiveness over their intellect.

When the climax starts to come into fruition, and Esther realizes that she cannot preserve her skin, and like everything else her life is bound for disappointment, she lies in her bed in the final shot, almost looking dead but still living, showing that Esther alike the rest of the gender will always be a soulless, empty vessel without as much purpose and worth as males until society corrects itself.

Therefore, with the soul of existentialism, and an outer-veneer akin to the hopelessness of a horror picture, In My Skin ends on a downer. The viewer can only ponder what kind of society pushes a woman to think of herself as nothing but a piece of meat, thus leaving Esther alone in a society that at the same time also stresses personal gain over others which is simply a never-ending cycle of disassociation. Simply, how can the gender get ahead if females aren't valued as anything but what they are not?

There was a couple of somewhat squeemish scenes for those with weak stomachs but to someone like me who has seen  most of the shock, disturbing and disgusting films out there, this was nothing more than a boring look into a self cutters life. I just thought there would be alot more cutting and mutilating than there was. There was realy no story at all in this movie. Why did she do it? Is she going to end up killing herself or will she get help? What was the point of this movie? The only thing that shocked and disturbed me was the ending. I actualy thought the disc somehow skipped from the middle to the end credits. But sadly not. It just ended kinda like the Sopranos just black then credits. I'm seeing this movie is getting hard to find for sale anywhere and I', guessing thats how the movie company plans on making money on a movie that was made in 2004 and just now getting notice.

8010026,5,B0001CNQSA,"Usually when we watch these kinds of film, we think ""oh it's another pseudo-snuff video/film"". Not in this case: In My Skin is one of the best, if not THE BEST, portrayals on self-mutilation. To be exact though, this film is not trying to convey images of pseudo-snuff-esque, rather conveying the addiction to self-mutilation. Yes, not only is self-mutilation for PSEUDO-SNUFF for ""entertainment"", but in real life self-mutilation is actually an addiction. I have actually personally talked to people who had an addiction to mutilating themselves. Just so we're clear, the type of self-mutilation is not the pop style in the ""emo scene"" where some teenager would cry and cut themselves and have little cuts on their arms. The type of self-mutilation I'm talking about is the type where a person DIGS into their skin, and not really SHOWING IT OFF to people. Matter of fact, people who are really addicted to self-mutilation actually covers it up like everything is fine, so no one will try to get in their way of mutilating themselves. It's a dangerous and painful addiction, just as bad as certain types of drugs.

And to sum it all up, this film is the epitome of portraying an everyday person(and the main character is actually a businesswoman) who secretly gets into self-mutilation due to a small accident of scrapping her leg a bit, eventually ends up digging deeper and deeper into the wound. If you want a pseudo-snuff film just for the sake of gore, you are in the wrong place. This movie is graphic but it's not as graphic as most of those PSEUDO-SNUFF films that ONLY focusing on the gore-aspect. This film is more psychological than entertainment. So if you want the type of film that reveals one of the darkest addictions among mankind, definitely check this film out.",1330300800,,1781,4.839344262295082
8010027,4,B0001CNQSA,"Esther is a self conscious woman who is moving up in the public relations firm she works at. Her boyfriend wants further their relationship and move in together. Her life is pretty successful as a whole, but this all changes when she goes to a party and she severely cuts her leg open when she falls down in her friends' unfinished backyard. The wound goes unnoticed as she dances and mingles until she goes to the bathroom and sees blood running down her leg. She is shocked at the severity of the injury, but still goes out for drinks with her friends before going to the doctor. While patching her up, the doctor notes that it was unusual that she waited hours to get help. The next day, she goes to work as usual, but she is distracted by her wounds and goes into a private room to create new gouges in her leg. This is the start of her obsession with harming herself. Her boyfriend and her co-workers worry about her and are horrified by her sick impulse, but she does it all the same and going to great lengths to blame the injuries on other things. Why is she hurting herself? Can she stop so she can resume her seemingly idyllic life?

In My Skin is a French film that was written and directed Marina de Van, who also starred as Esther. The film is incredibly disturbing and undeniably original. It's far from the conventional slasher type horror film, but features a more subtle Cronenburgian type of horror. Esther could be any one of us because she is the typical middle class everyman. The real triumph of a work like this is the realism and intimacy of the self mutilation scenes and the lack of any clear, defined reason for it. I like that this prompts the viewer to substitute in their own meanings and think for themselves.

One take on the film is that Esther's motivation for her self mutilation stems from a need to fill the void of her shallow, vapid life, much like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. He focused his violence outwardly and Esther looks within. This view is most apparent during a scene where she's having dinner with her boss and some of their clients. At first, Esther is the model employee, engaging intelligently in conversation and making her boss happy. Then she hallucinates that her arm is separate from her body and becomes distracted, succumbing to her self mutilating urges in the wine cellar of the restaurant. This hollow feeling extends to every part of her life. Her boyfriend is controlling, borderline abusive, and picks a fight at every little opportunity. It's no wonder why she seems passively resistant to moving in together. Esther tells her only friend, a coworker, of her obsession perhaps in a cry for help. The next day, that same friend abandons her and allows her to be humiliated at a work party all because she was jealous that Esther was promoted above her. These are the only two real relationships Esther has and they are revealed to be void of any actual human connection.

Another view of the film is that Esther feels disconnected from her body, much like Dawn from Teeth. Again, this is most exemplified in the restaurant scene with her disembodied arm. The only way her body feels whole again is through pain. The scenes of self mutilation are filmed in an intimate, erotic way, as if it's a twisted form of masturbation for her. From the very beginning, she treats it as an illicit affair: hiding it from her boyfriend, telling her friend to gauge her reaction, and lying to hide how often she does it. She even flaunts the behavior in public like an exhibitionist when she stabs herself under the table at a business dinner, cuts herself at work, and fondles chunks of her flesh on the street. Her love and connectedness with her body can only be shown through blood and pain, but she seems to also get pleasure from it.

The self mutilation in the film can also be taken as a metaphor for self destructive behavior such as alcoholism, drug addiction, or eating disorders. It starts out small. The mutilation goes from cutting to drinking her own blood to cutting parts of her flesh off and eating them. At first, the cutting gives her energy and keeps her focused on work. As it worsens, it consumes her life, making it impossible to function normally. At this stage, the behavior is so extreme that it threatens her life. The blood loss and cutting of pieces of flesh invites infection and the possibility of nicking an artery or major vein and bleeding to death. Any other addictive behavior could have been substituted in and it would have fit perfectly. Her attempts to reach out to her friend seems to be a cry for help, but jealousy and bitterness causes the friend to turn her back on Esther. Her boyfriend seems more concerned about controlling her as opposed to actually helping her.

There are probably a million ways for this film to be interpreted, so I'll stop here. This film definitely isn't for everyone. It's not very gory, but it's guaranteed to make you feel uncomfortable. I highly recommend this film, but be warned that it is slow in some parts. This doesn't bother me at all because I think it fits the type of film that it is, but it might bother some. I watched this film over a year ago for the first time and I still feel the need to rewatch it and re-evaluate my theories on it. I highly recommend this engaging and memorable film.",1298505600,,5340,4.569937369519833
8010028,4,B0001CNQSA,"After receiving a deep gash to her leg in an accident, an obsessive marketing executive develops a compulsion to play with the wound and to cause herself additional bodily harm for her own sick pleasure. This cleanly dressed production tackles the edgy subject of self-mutilation in a way that no other film has in the past. Although it is incredibly horrific, IN MY SKIN focuses its attention on the psychological condition that drives Esther's cutting rather than simply exploiting the gut-wrenching scenes of extreme gore. The film has often been compared to the works of both Roman Polanski and David Cronenberg, and with good reason, as it combines the same delusory behavior that Catherine Deneuve's character experienced in REPULSION with the graphic and nauseating body horror found in SHIVERS or RABID. Marina de Van's devastating performance is disgusting and frightening because it is honest and real. The overriding theme of addiction that she instills in the script stretches far beyond the plot itself, as the topic of self-mutilation could easily be interchanged with any other compulsive behavior and still be just as effective. There is also a sickening sense of realism in every pinch, every cut, and every bite that makes Esther's personal butchery utterly believable. Horror fans that are seeking out the next INSIDE may be sorely disappointed, however those interested in shocking and brutal character studies will find IN MY SKIN to be a modern classic in French cinema.
