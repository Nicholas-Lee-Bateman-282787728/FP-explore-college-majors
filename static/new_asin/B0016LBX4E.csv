8263030,3,B0016LBX4E,"The title makes it deceptive. I associated the  title "" Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom "" with Marlin Perkins and / or Jim Fowler . I thought that this dvd set was going to be all episodes with Marlin and / or Jim in them . That is episodes that were re-shown in 2007 from when they were originally aired in earlier years , but that is not the case . It only has one episode with Marlin and Jim , which is the first episode. This is a big let down. I grew up watching Marlin and Jim on Wild Kingdom . Some of the episodes even though they didn't have Marlin or Jim , were good . The others were not that good.",1412380800,,608,3.864
