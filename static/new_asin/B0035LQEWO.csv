4071311,4,B0035LQEWO,"I was quite surprised while watching this digital animation movie that I was being drawn in.  Reminded me of Goonies, Back To The Future and the like.
Both parent and child will enjoy this!
Definitely would like to see a sequel.",1332892800,,228,4.560975609756097
4071312,4,B0035LQEWO,"My 3 year-old son is VERY into trains right now; first saw this movie at the toy train museum in our home town and of course he loved it!  he has watched it quite a few times now and it does not seem to get old.  like other reviews said this movie literally just ends, almost mid-story.  so from an adult perspective you are left wondering what happens next in an annoying sort of way.  Fortunately my son could care less about that!  Supposedly there is to be a second movie, so we will see if that comes out any time soon.  Other than the ending (or lack there of!) I would absolutely recommend this movie, especially if your child is as into trains as mine!",1314057600,3,660,4.198412698412699
4071313,1,B0035LQEWO,"With so many good childrens movies out there, it's easy to expect a certain standard. This falls amazingly short. It falls short of the quality on kids channels like PBS, Nickelodeon or Disney. It's just bad.

The plot is convoluted; especially for youngsters, and has very little train imagery. The story has a lot of parts that kids under five may find scary. The animation may be good by video game standards from a few years ago, but not by any movie standards from today (2011).

This movie seems conceived as some sort of massive product placement strategy from the marketing minds at Lionel. The plot seems as good as one could expect from people whose responsibilities usually include selling toys, but decided to chase their passion by writing a story that has very little to do with their day jobs. It's surprising how small a role the trains play in this movie.

Worst of all, at what can be considered a pivotal point in the plot, the movie ends. On the screen is an ad for kids to buy the sequel. Oh the horror.

If your child likes trains, buy one of the new animated Thomas the Tank movies like Hero of the Rails.  If your child wants an entertaining show there are so many better options on TV or elsewhere. Just don't spend your time watching this.",1306627200,,1265,4.506550218340611
4071314,4,B0035LQEWO,"I have to give Lionel credit; this is not the lame hour long commercial it could have been (and that I half suspected it was going to be.)  There really wasn't that much product placement given the premise.  The most prominently featured relatively current product was arguably the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lionel-Wild-West-Set/dp/B000NVGLTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lionel Wild West Set</a>, but nobody could accuse Lionel of rubbing our noses in it (unlike some other toy companies I could name!).  Of course the Lionel name and Big L are practically everywhere, but virtually the entire cast are Lionel employees or their families, and the story revolves around a Lionel technological breakthrough gone horribly wrong (again, a very surprising and rather gutsy premise for a toy company movie).

Even the technological breakthrough in question starts out sounding almost plausible and exactly the sort of thing that would interest the most sophisticated (and wealthy) model train enthusiasts.  Essentially Dr. Z. W. and the parents of Nancy and Bobby Pullmor have developed a way for enthusiasts to make their model railroad layouts into virtual reality worlds.  However, there are a couple of problems.  The first is that some thieves with inside help are attempting to steal the breakthrough; the second is that the breakthrough turns out to be more advanced than originally thought,...

a LOT more advanced!

Defects?  Frankly, the computer generated animation was nothing to shout about, and I noticed a few things that made little sense (A US criminal court banning someone for life?  On what authority?)  However, the biggest defect, as almost every other reviewer has noted, is the lack of an ending.  I can understand Lionel contemplating setting additional movies in this alternate universe; I cannot understand Lionel spreading a single movie out over two (or MORE?) DVD's, much worse spreading the releases out over two or more YEARS!

With no indications of the second DVD in sight, purchase Lionelville Destination: Adventure and show it to your children at your peril.",1297900800,,2137,5.535384615384616
4071315,4,B0035LQEWO,A clerk in a train shop I occasionally stop at (which will remain nameless) said he had heard that the seqel may come out in spring or summer.  I was hoping it would come out in time for last Christmas.  I mean that's when toy train sales get the highball.,1297728000,4,256,4.1
4071316,4,B0035LQEWO,"I don't known who is charge at Lionel since Chapt. 11, but they're letting a ball, with a great trademark, drop --so much for ""A Heart of Gold"" Mr. young or Mr. Calabrese, or whoever runs the show.

Not only are Lionel's prices increasing, but their quality is dropping (I just bought a new Lionel Scout and it doesn't work right), and now this, NO sequel to the first film, ""Lionelville Destination: Adventure""

The first film (2009?), which is fairly well done, concludes by telling you there is a sequel.

O.K., so you've got the grandkids by the fire, eating popcorn and they're really into the first film (which I was, and I'm 64!) -- then suddenly it ends and tells you there is a ""Frontierville"" sequel.

  ""C'mon grandpa, put in the next DVD, hurry!""

Only there is no next DVD! Try and find it!

Try and find out who owns Lionel or where their headquarters are located (Michigan? New York, China?)

NOW what do I tell the grandkids Lionel????  Where is the sequel????
Let me tell you, it is in the same place as Lionel's quality!!!",1295654400,,1040,4.5133689839572195
4071317,4,B0035LQEWO,"Great story line for children and adults alike, but leaves you hanging.  Don't even start without having part 2 ready.",1293926400,7,118,4.9
4071318,5,B0035LQEWO,This was a fantastic family movie adventure for all train lovers.  At the end of the movie it showed a preview of a followup movie called Lionel Lionelville Destination Frontierville.  When will it be available?,1285977600,3,211,5.0
8389164,3,B0035LQEWO,"I am torn of how to review this movie.  At a Christmas train show my in laws purchased this for my sons, who love trains.  We watched right away, but they were a little young to understand the plot.  At the end, despite their age then they wanted to know what will happen.  We didn't play it again for many months.

The quality of the movie is great and the plot is interesting.  However, the fact that there is not a sequel makes this movie somewhat pointless.  Why start a mystery of it's never solved?  If I were still teaching fourth grade I might use it as a writing tool to have the children write their own ending.  But...I'm not, I'm a mom and my boys now a year older are disappointed that they won't find out what happens.",1423699200,,732,4.2086330935251794
8389165,5,B0035LQEWO,"My grandson age 7 loves this (and so do I).  Wish part two would come out or even a series of Lionel train movies.  My grandson loves trains expecially movies with ""runaway"" trains.",1419984000,,181,4.454545454545454
8389166,3,B0035LQEWO,"My boys are at that age where they wants lots of action and adventure but they aren't ready for the violence that comes with those movies. They both got really interested in the story line. I was feeling really good about the movie. It was different plot but not so confusing that you can't follow it. I would have easily given the movie a 4 star rating, not epic so no 5 star rating. Then I took away a star b/c there the movie just ends... no ending and says will be continued. When the movie was over the boys asked me to get on Amazon and order them part two and said they would pay for the movie b/c they wanted to find out what happened. And now I find out there is no part two and it doesn't look like there ever will be. I would have been fine if the movie had an ending and then a sequel but it just ends. Very disappointing.",1388793600,,834,4.0
8389167,1,B0035LQEWO,"After an hour of the kids getting into the movie, it just drops with the promise of part 2 (that was never made).  Way to create a bad impression for future generations Lionel!  My daughter just told me, ""Daddy, they lied. They said they were going to make another one.""  My son just said, ""I wish we never watched that.""  Happy, Lionel?",1387756800,3,337,4.387096774193548
8389168,1,B0035LQEWO,"Well, my seven year old has been in tears for the better part of the evening.  Admittedly, we must be some sort of luddites that he didn't really understand that movies or TV could end abruptly without a conclusion to the story and just leave you hanging.  He hasn't seen long-format episodic TV with major theme arcs at his age, so most episodes of Disney TV and Nick JR wrap up the story in just an episode.  SO, we watched the Lionel Destination:Adventure DVD that grandpa got him with some new model trains and train track, thought it was relatively nice (and amazing for the kid who's into trains), and then the story looked like it was starting to wrap up, got to an interesting turn of events, and then just ended, not even with a really good cliffhanger but just with an abrupt ""well, come back for more in the Destination:Frontierville sequel.

Well, there is no sequel.  Lionel's site doesn't reference one, and the last reviews here referencing one are from 2 years ago.  Have written to Lionel to find out, but until you find out if there's a part 2, this is ABSOLUTELY not a good enough story to bother watching the conclusion-less part we have in this DVD.  Rent Polar Express again or just watch some cool videos of trains and model trains.  You, and your crying kid, will be better off.",1370131200,3,1302,4.51063829787234

ointed on how long this is taken",1369094400,,123,4.166666666666667
8389170,1,B0035LQEWO,Don't buy this movie unless you are sure you can also get part 2. It just stops and tells you it continues in part 2. We have been waiting for 3 years. They may not even be making it.,1362960000,,183,3.717948717948718
8389171,5,B0035LQEWO,"The movie was excellent and I had a room full of kids captivated by it and then poof!!! The end comes and says ""to be continued"" watch for Frontierville.  Well where is it?",1354147200,,172,4.212121212121212
8389172,3,B0035LQEWO,"The movie itself was really good-  but I wouldn't even bother purchasing this product since there is no conclusion.  It is 3 years later, and the sequel still is not available.",1344211200,,176,4.645161290322581
8389173,5,B0035LQEWO,"With a 6 year old hyper-focused on everything to do with trains, this came as a welcome surprise right under the Polar Express movie. I enjoyed it along with his mom even after he played it for the 5th time the same day it arrived.

If you have a child that loves trains, then this is a must have movie !",1341360000,,304,3.9836065573770494
