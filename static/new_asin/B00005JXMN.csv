1613523,5,B00005JXMN,"PBS has finally lost exclusive rights to this fine concert tape by the great young Belgian singer Michael Junior.  As a result, the video is being reissued by Coeur de lion video to the general public.  If you have not seen this concert as broadcast on PBS let me try to explain to you why you simply MUST buy it... today...
The moment Michael opens his mouth to sing your heart will melt,  your smile will broaden, your adventure will begin.  Michael is the protege of the great Belgian tenor, Helmut Lotti.  In this concert Lotti first introduces Michael to the German audience, then sings a duet with the boy,  ""Panis Angelicus"". You won't believe it!  Such assured phrasing, such rich color in his voice, such charming stage presence!  All from a 13-year-old boy at one of his very first concerts, yet he seems like a seasoned veteran. After this beautiful duet (sung in Latin)  Michael is left to do the rest of the show alone (except at the end.)  Because his native language is Dutch, everything done here is in what is a foreign language to Michael.  So he must speak to this German audience in German.  Even this short introduction is sweet and charming, whether you understand what Michael is saying or not.  From then on the show is his alone.  He takes command, sings, sways, he charms and flirts with the audience. (This boy knows how to use his eyes to charm and does so without conceit. And he's just about the cutest young performer around! And so small!  Some in Europe call him the ""Little Prince!""  ""The Young Lotti"".)
Dressed to the nines in a black tuxedo and a white bow tie almost as big as his head, he sings classic song after classic song on a beautiful stage with a symphony orchestra led by conductor Andre Walschaerts, and with a beautiful chorus whose voices complement but never intrude on Michael's stirring vocals.  The set of songs here are so well chosen that they achieve a rare unity, working together to make a unified whole!  Yet there is great variety in the music.  He sings softly in songs like ""Eidelweiss"" and ""Ich Liebe Dich."" Yet he sings with playfulness and joy in songs like ""La Spagnola"" and ""Friends"".  He sings with passion and power in songs like ""Il Mondo"", ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", ""Ave Maria"", and ""Santa Lucia."" He sings with the almost aching yearning of young love in ""Ich Liebe Dich.""  This is a truly first rate production in all ways. He sings in four languages: Latin, German, English, and Italian. (On his CD's he also sings in French and Dutch.) At the end of the concert, Helmut Lotti returns to sing a final duet with Michael, ""Friends"" - a sweetly swaying ballad about the joys of having and being a friend.  If your eyes by this time are not at least moist, you're stronger than I am! I've seen the concert many times and I always get misty in all the joy!
This ""Dreamland"" concert was recorded in October, 1999. So it has been two years.  Since then Michael Junior (his real name is Michael Verschuere) has performed in over 200 live concerts across Europe, South Africa, and North America. Now fifteen, his voice has completely changed, matured into a gorgeous baritone.  His new single will be released on July 9, 2001 in Belgium.  The song will be the beautiful old standard Italian song ""Volare"".  This is the first release from his new album ""Italian Classics"" which should be released in Europe by the end of summer. Amazon should have it soon after that date... I hope.  I have heard only snippets of the new voice but I can tell you that it is a rich baritone, yet it is a young baritone. Enchanting and full, warm and passionate.  Michael can still hit the highest notes, but his voice is even richer than the child's voice you will hear in this video... and that's very rich indeed.
Special Edition: So why is this video called ""Special Edition""?  The PBS tape is almost the same as this one.  What's different is that this Special Edition has an extra song, ""Nur Die Schwane Wissen Wo"" a lovely song about a better world, a world only the swans can find!  Filmed in a zoo, the production is quite different from the rest of the concert, but the musical quality is the same.  All Michael Junior fans will want this tape, even if they already have the PBS production, for this marvelous performance alone!  Also the ending credits are longer than in the PBS tape.  We see more of the ending as Michael and Helmut walk into the audience and bow among the fans.
Why do I think you MUST buy this tape today?  Michael Verchuere is at the very beginning of his career.  This concert can never be repeated. Already his voice has completely changed.  Imagine the great stars of the past that you love.  Wouldn't it be great to have a beautiful quality film of that great star performing at the age of 13?  Michael will have a long career. He WILL become one of the world's great singers. I cannot foretell the future of course, BUT I am sure Michael will be one of the great stars of the 21st century.  Like a little blond Julius Caesar, he can say, ""I came, I sang, I conquered!""",993168000,53,5054,4.504939626783754

7942689,5,B00005JXMN,"This is a nice ""feel good"" video. I first saw him on PBS and was enthralled. He has a great voice and a wonderful stage presence!
If you are looking for a video that will make you feel good, this is definitely it!  It is without a doubt, a ""MUST HAVE"" video.
Michael Junior is the most exciting young performer I have ever seen.  The video production itself is extremely well done and presents Michael's natural charm and talent in a manner that is very appealing, if not heart wrenching.
If you have not seen his PBS performance you are in for a real treat with this one.  This particular presentation is a little longer than the PBS one so there is even more of Michael to enjoy.
In an era when there is so much trouble in the world, it is just wonderful to see a young man like Michael take the stage and truly sing his heart out.",1001635200,,833,4.19375
