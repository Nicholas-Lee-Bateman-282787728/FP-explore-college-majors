I had to change the region on my computer to either 2 or 4 region to be able to view them.  I think there should be a warning about the different regions before you purchase the DVD'S.  I even tried to buy a DVD player that you could change the regions on & could purchase on locally.",1455235200,4,437,3.9431818181818183
