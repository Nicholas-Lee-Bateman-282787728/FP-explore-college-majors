5647671,5,B00BMQODHM,"Martin Short is a TERRIFIC voice for this cartoon. My kids loooove learning about nature and science with these videos! It's educational and very humorous so even if mom & dad are in the room watching it's enjoyable (no offense Dora...okay a lot of offense, your voice is like nails on a chalkboard). This is an A+ purchase.",1395619200,,324,4.603448275862069
5647672,5,B00BMQODHM,"Oh my, where do I start....These are great!!!  We have several of them and I love the format (20 mins for each episode) or you can ""play all"" and it's about an hour.  Content is great if you are looking for educational and entertaining DVD's.  PLUS, they are fun for adults to watch too.  Our three year old has been watching these since Nov. 2013 and the things she has learned through them is so fun to hear about and she loves to pretend play Cat in the Hat.",1393718400,,461,4.146067415730337
5647673,4,B00BMQODHM,"Perfect for my daughter who is getting ready to go back to school and for her sister who is about to start.  After watching the video, my daughter is already collecting random items for ""Show and Tell"".  She doesn't even have show and tell at school but would love to after watching this.  It was silly and she learned about the seasons as well!",1375833600,,345,4.359375
5647674,5,B00BMQODHM,"What can I say about the new Cat in the Hat "" Show and Tell.""  It's instantly a favorite. Learning about the seasons. Talking about what show and tell is got us talking about school. And probably the best part are Cats little jokes that my four year old tells over and over. ""I like to call these FUNglasses."" ""The way fish plays this game it should be splashketball.""  It's great to see him understand and appreciate this word play and carry it onto other types of conversations. LOVE Cat in the Hat Knows a lot About that movies AND books. Thank you!!!!",1375228800,,555,4.378640776699029
5647675,5,B00BMQODHM,"The Cat in the Hat is a new favorite in our house, and this DVD is a great addition. It includes 5 episodes- Spring & Summer, Fall & Winter, Amazing Eyes, Hooray for Hair, and When I Grow Up. I absolutely love how the kids (4 yrs, 2.5 yrs) are learning and being entertained at the same time! The songs are great, the Cat in the Hat is hilarious, as always, and Thing One and Thing Two are so silly!

I especially love tying these DVD's in with The Cat in the Hat Learning Library books. My kids have learned so much from them, the rhyming patterns are great, and I love that both the show and the books teach to kids without talking down to them. They explain the big words instead of just avoiding them.

This certified early elementary teacher is impressed!",1373587200,,760,4.270833333333333
