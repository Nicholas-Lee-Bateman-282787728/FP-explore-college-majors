1542728,5,B00005JNS4,"Ed was my favorite television show of all time, and I'm really sad that there's no way for me to share it with my boyfriend, who foolishly never watched it while it was on the air.  I understand that one big reason Ed wasn't released on DVD long ago is that it featured lots of music and that it is difficult to get all of the songs' copyright holders to give licenses for the songs to be used on home video.  The Wonder Years faced a similar challenge, but after negotiating with lots of copyright holders as well as replacing a few songs for which licenses could not be obtained, that DVD series was just released with much fanfare (and, from what I can gather, commercial success).  Perhaps now would be an appropriate time to revisit the possibility of releasing Ed on DVD?  If it's released, I promise to buy lots of copies for friends and family so they can share in this quirky, wholesome, engaging show!",1420675200,29,911,4.437125748502994

1542732,5,B00005JNS4,"Unless you've seen this show, it's really hard to put in writing just how good it actually was.  Every character fit perfectly, and many life lessons were learned along the way, in a very upbeat, comedic way, with plenty of other emotional infusions into the fold.  I try to record the series whenever they do show up occasionally here and there, but there's nothing like having a boxed set sittting in a library of all your favorite shows.  Desperate !  Actually sent David Letterman an email, challenging him to have this series released prior to his departure from Late Night.  Letterman was the producer of the show, calling his own production firm Worldwide Pants.  Sounds just like Dave.  C'mon Mr. L - you have the pull, the power and should also have the passion !

ED is and always will be one of my favorite shows. Tom Cavanaugh was adorable and sincere in the role, and the entire supporting cast matched his sincerity in creating a lovely and complete scenario of regular people like you and me.

I crave this show on DVD, and you'd think the studio would like to cash in, regarding the hundreds of positive reviews here on Amazon. NBC has been digging its own grave for years, and the execs are simply not paying attention.",1387497600,3,568,4.514563106796117

Music rights aside, I'd still buy it with alternate music; better than not having it at all. I loved that Ed was such a hopeful romantic, he was ever the optimist. The cast was wonderful and had such great chemistry. It's such a shame NBC canceled it. And an even bigger shame that people weren't watching it. I think it may have been too wholesome; shows these days have too much drama. This was a simple story of boy loves girl. I always knew/hoped Ed & Carol would find each other in the end & I felt like I was with the characters for all the highs & lows. If you get a chance to see this show, watch it.

Please, please, please work that out - or whatever the holdout is - and get us the DVDs. If the problem is a lack of demand, then please consider making it available for digital purchase on demand.

All ""Ed"" fans -- all 47 of us -- should rise up, contact Worldwide Pants and demand satisfaction !!  Personally, I am boycotting ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" until ""Ed"" is released -- and I have notified Worldwide Pants of this boycott.  Because of me, they have at least 5 less viewers, and once my boycott steamrolls across the country, they WILL sit up and take notice.  Is this the dumbest thing ever?  Probably.  Do I have too much time on my hands?  Most certainly.  But, hey, I like the show............and the bootleg copies just don't cut it.  So, to Worldwide Pants, if you want me off your back, release ""Ed"" already.  Thank You.",1368662400,16,878,4.535031847133758
1542895,5,B00005JNS4,"Ok so it is nearly 1st December 2012 and im doing my occassional check to see if any progress has been made on releasing this TV programme on DVD, so i goggle ED on DVD to see that nothing new has been added since i checked about a year ago. No Progress at all not even a teeny weeny bit of new info . Its is typical of me that i choose a TV series to love that is probably never going to be released. As the years pass it is slowly sinking from my memory and im thinking i will never watch this again. Alas at least i watched a lot of the episodes and will always remember the intro  with that great song by Clem Snide. ( Foo fighters music also in other seasons).
I did actually tape a lot of season 4 and 3 on DVD when they played on tv but i did this at a time when DVD recorders were new and the DVD ram discs that i used don't play on any of the new dvd players and i think the discs are useless now which is a bit of a bugger .

So thank you to all involved in ED for making such a feelgood programme which gives you real hope in life and  and that the world is not just greedy and money obsessed but people do care about one another( even if it is just fantasy) i genuinely genuinely looked forward to and purposely stayed in to watch ( i have never done that before) . So for giving me that warm glow inside when watching, you have my respect as one of the greats

Update 25 dec 2013

First time I have thought about this series since I wrote the above message in dec 2012. So it has been over a year and my check to see if any progress has been made on its release has again been a disappointment. Would of been perfect christmas television  over the holidays but was not meant to be.
I have to say, as annoying as it is this series not being released it is truly nice to hear the comments from other fans who also want that escapism and warm show back in their lives .
I also had a big crush on Julie Bowen and thought Mike was hilarious with his dry humour.
I don't watch a lot of tv programmes and am yet to find its equal even after 10 plus years. Is all this pleading going on deaf ears? Does anyone listen to the public/ fans.
I may return next December 2014 if I remember? Or perhaps I may think about the show sooner.
Thanks to the people that left me comments and I hope you don't forget the show completely - not just yet anyway , as there still is hope .

Yes, that sounds boring, but it was not. The show was funny and there was the continual tension about whether or not Ed would ever win the love of Carol, whom he had a crush on when they were in high school together. It was entertaining, but also made you feel good. I would watch Ed 100 times before I ever watched an episode of Jersey Shore or The Apprentice.",1331510400,2,504,4.153061224489796

All those out there who like genuinely well-rounded characters should also check out the gems created by Bryan Fuller like the show Dead Like Me.  He is coming out with a readaptation of the Munsters in 2012 and although I generally hate remakes I am looking forward to this one because the writer for the series is Bryan Fuller AND it will be directed by Bryan Singer, whose action movies I love because he doesn't lose endearing character development amidst the special effects.",1323993600,2,707,4.778688524590164

Each and every week funny and charming Ed Stevens and his off-beat friends entered our home, shared their lives with us, made us laugh, and added in some almost immeasurable way a little more light into our lives.  And now, more than ten years after we first became a part of Stuckeyville, we continue to search the Primetime lineup for the show that would endeavor to fill our hearts as they once had.  Sadly, we are coming up short.  This page is both a homage to a great show, whose light was expended way too soon, and a plea the parties that be to please bring it to DVD.

1543089,5,B00005JNS4,"Ed was part of my Wednesday night line-up in college and I looked forward to it every week.  Tom Cavanaugh is Ed, a New York city lawyer who returns to his hometown in Ohio after finding his wife in bed with another man.  He comes across an opportunity to purchase a bowling alley and runs his law office from there.  There is the usual cast of zany characters to support him as he rebuilds his life and reconnects with old friends, including his high school crush Carol Vessy.

On the surface, the show is snarky and funny and totally tongue-in-cheek.  But delve a bit deeper into it, and you discover that the characters are layered and flawed. They are struggling with the American dream and what it means to them as they age and discover what it is they truly want out of life.",1283904000,,781,4.395833333333333

This show had everything great tv shows should.  it was hilarious when needed, thoughtful, emotional, dramatic and realistic in a way that you thought you were really involved in these people's lives.  each hiatus between seasons was a chasm of anticipation.  the most perfectly cast show on network television and in my mind, NBC's last genuinely great hour long program.  i was heartbroken when it ended.  it was like watching your best friends all move far far away at the same time.

nothing was like Ed, nor will anything ever be.  Come on nbc and give us what we, the fans want.  in an era where full seasons are available pretty much immediately after the season has just ended, it's pathetic that this work on genius still sits on the shelf.

Perhaps, if the video scalpers had made top-notch quality of the DVDs they were selling, we would have already been enjoying the four episodic seasons over and over.

Now I don't really know the hang-ups to getting the complete four seasons of ""Ed"" out on DVD, but there is such a thing as a shelf life and mortality. Putting off the availability of the seasonal DVD's much longer could result in a lower demand and be thought of as nice to have instead of a desire to own, like many other original TV series we use to watch with great anticipation each week. These four complete seasons are well worth a fair and competitive cost. Don't wait too long and make us both loose out.

It has been more than a year since I first posted my review of ""Ed"" and I am really frustrated with those who have deterred the dvd presentations of ""Ed's"" 4 complete seasons.

Ed was funny, clean, and highly-entertaining.  Very rarely has a show mashed up as well with my ""slightly-off"" sense of humor.  Chuck is another of those shows (can't wait for him to return either!)

The characters were (in their own way) deep and getting deeper.  The dialogue was always awesome.  The Ed and Carol interactions were only topped by the Ed and Mike interactions.  We just loved it.  All-around great family-friendly show.  Bring out the DVDs!!!",1215561600,,621,4.666666666666667

I remember signing up for the list to be notified when this becomes available a few months ago, and still NOTHING!

I don't write reviews here, but for this I made an exception. Please release this on DVD. For how long it's been, might as well release all 4 friggen seasons, packed with awesome extras and commentaries on every episode, in a collectible package at a bargain price. Seems to happen that way with every other show on DVD, us poor saps buy them one by one and then the entire series gets nicely packaged into one easier-to-afford box set. So heres the chance to just hit us Ed fans with everything at once and we'll buy it.

Or release them one by one. I DONT EVEN CARE AT THIS POINT, JUST GIMME THE DVDS!

It is true that the last two seasons weren't *quite* as perfect as the first two seasons, but even then it was better than anything else on TV.

There's something about American drama that we just don't do here in the UK (we're too busy doing gritty realism I suppose) and this show has everything that's appealing about US television in it; quirkiness, warmth and humour.  Ed offers a great 45 minutes of escapism, but also gently reminds us that it's good to dwell on the good things in life - love, fun, friendship and honour.  Here's hoping the corporate suits can show some honour too, and produce a DVD soon for those of us who haven't seen the show in its entirety, and would like to; and also for those fans who would like to revisit Stuckeyville again.",1189641600,,827,4.5369127516778525

It does wander at times, but that's life - life has a way of not being neat and tidy and that is reflected in the show.

The $10 bets were so funny that a friend of mine and I adopted them to carry on the Ed legacy. The interplay between everyone on this show makes you feel like you ""fit in"" with them, or even know people ""like them"" from your own life. That's how real it is.

I've been checking for this set for so long it's ridiculous. The network has to know there is demand, but something is holding it up.

Am not usually a huge fan of this type of series - can take it or leave it - but this one hooked me from the very beginning.
The characters are all intelligent and engaging with quirky running jokes and understated humour. It never takes itself too seriously but still manages to make you both laugh and, at times, cry.

Amongst these was The West Wing, Freak and Geeks, and Ed. The former two have been paid highest respects in their DVD releases, however, all four seasons of Ed have yet to see release.

Ed holds up today, even after seven years, as one of the strongest, wittiest, smartest-written shows of our generation. Watching the one lone episode I have on DVD right now (Captain Lucidity, S3E17, from an NBC Emmy screener disc,) the writing and humour remains as funny and fresh as it was 4 years ago. It almost pains me to watch, as it leaves me wanting more.

If I were to make an open plea to the show's production company, Worldwide Pants, and its owner, David Letterman, it would be: Please obtain clearances for the music used in all four seasons, and let it see a proper release on either DVD or a high definition media format. You could easily fit an entire season on one HD-DVD in standard definition. I realise the show was shot on film, but possibly edited on videotape; if it was edited and mastered on film, then please do high-definition transfers.

1543811,5,B00005JNS4,"This show ranks up there with all my favorite TV shows.  I think it was a modern day ""version"" of Northern Exposure.  It looked different totally, but it had MANY similarities.  Quirky characters centered around a small town, with a love situation in the middle.  However I still think Northern Exposure is a better show, this one comes in a close second.

I would love to see this show come out on DVD.  And right now there is a website out there where you can sign up to cast your name in a vote to get it released.  I can't put the link here, but if you search hard enough you can find it.

I hear the reasons for its late release is over music issues.  I would have thought that they would pay for the music up front for the show and have it ready for the DVD release.  Especially when you are dealing with a show this popular.

The music in many of the shows changes from when it was on the air, to when its released on DVD, but shows like Northern Exposure seem just fine cause you can't remember what the original music was anyways.  And if they do a good enough job of placing new music in, you would never know anyways...

So bottom line is, even though this show does start out normal and turn into a soap opera, it does keep most of its charms throughout the entire series.  The $10 bets, Phil and his insane ideas, and all of the other charms that ran throughout the show.

I know it takes a lot of time/effort/money to get all the clearances, so release the DVDs without the music if you must.  Too many ED fans are patiently waiting to see this wonderful show again...great cast, great writing (not the usual predictable plotlines and jokes), great chemistry.

I never really followed a television show until Ed came on.  It was well-written, filled with realistic (Phil Stubbs' annoyances aside) characters and situations, and did make you remember the ""trials and tribulations"" of searching for/falling in love.

1543959,5,B00005JNS4,"Sometimes, the networks let a potentially great one slip away, due to ""just"" satisfactory ratings. For 4 years, David Letterman's company - Worldwide Pants, Inc. gave us just such a show - ""Ed""; a lovely and quirky ensemble comedy featuring a truly gifted cast including Tom Cavanugh, Julie Bowen, Josh Randall, Justin Long, Jana Marie Hupp, Lesley Boone among others and smartly written by Jon Beckerman and Rob Burnett.

Briefly summarized, Ed Stevens, a NYC lawyer who loses his job, comes home to find his wife sleeping with the mailman; he decides to return gto his hometown  of Stuckeyville, Ohio in a quixotic search for his identity, and the unrequited high school love he left behind, the beautiful Carol Vessey, now a high school English teacher with her own wanderlust and uncertainty; Torn between her friendship with Ed and his persistent and humorous wooing and courtship of her, their relationship is the centerpiece of 83 wonderful episodes.

Ed buys the local bowling alley, where he sets up his law office, and rediscovers the merriment and joy of smalltown life with renewed, meaningful friendships and relationships.

The cast of characters - from his bowling alley employees to his relationships with his childhood best buddy, (now Dr.) Mike Burton, his wife Nancy,  Carol and Molly Hudson (H.S. principal ), the neophyte HS student Warren Cheswick - (superbly and obnoxiously portrayed by Justin Long)and his pursuit of life , love and lust are deftly interwoven in episodic gems, all with the central theme of Ed's pursuit of and friendship with Carol Vessey. There's a great story ""arc"" featuring the gorgeous Rena Sofer as ADA Bonnie Hanes who pursues Ed, much to the chagrin of a still uncertain Carol, and we feel Carol's angst as she discovers her true feelings for Ed begin to surface.

Termed by TV Guide's Matt Roush as ""one of the best shows you are not watching for each of its four seasons, each epsiode captures the romance and longing for the simpler values of life and love by each of its characters.

I recently acquired a pretty fair copy of the complete series, but have been looking forward to the series' ""official commercial"" pristine release. I watched the complete run over the course of several weeks. I found myself  laughing out loud, ""tearing up"" emotionally, wincing at embarrasing moments, but being altogether enchanted once again. It was so nice to renew friendships with ""the folks of Stuckeyville"" and the warm characters who who pass thru Stuckeybowl.

From beginning to end, the show is a pure joy and one to be treasured. I recommend it highly and apologize for my wordy prose. Rent disc 1 when the dvd debuts in early 2007, and I assure the reader he or she will add the entire series to their shelves. (too bad the entire series couldn't be released as one set - and reasonably priced; after all, those who ""get"" the show, will certainly purchase the entire set). Latecomers will, too!

Ed's exploits as he tries to win the heart of Carol are some of the best, and funniest ever aired on television. The cast, including the quirky Stuckeybowl staff, are some of the best characters to grace the small screen since ""Newhart"" and ""Northen Exposure"".

The show was produced by Rob Burnett and Jon Beckerman, who did most of the writing. These guys used to write for Dave Letterman who was executive producer.

The 83 episodes aired on NBC between 2000 and 2004 were possibly the best television hours produced in this century so far. ""Ed"" is warm, funny, quirky, and superior TV in every way. Anyone who watches this show will be instantly hooked, and will want to move to Stuckeyville after watching a couple of episodes.

On top of all that, the soundtrack is great too!

Please release on DVD! I would buy all episodes available in a heartbeat.",1123027200,9,1266,4.6591928251121075

The quirkiness and the heartfelt characters of the show were charming and entertaining. At one point, I even wanted to move to ""Stuckeyville,"" or at least someplace just like it.",1122422400,80,345,4.375
1544261,5,B00005JNS4,"This show ranks up there with Northern Exposure and Freaks and Geeks! It is original and thoroughly entertaining. I would wait each week for ED night and could not be disturbed for anything...sounds pathetic?! I need ED...it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me forget about the job, the house, the momdom and the outside world. For one hour a week I could let myself go to Stuckeyville!! Please, please, PLEASE release this on DVD. I will be the first one to buy it, probably two because I want to share it with a friend, who sadly enough didn't get to enjoy it the first time ,but has heard all about from me!",1122336000,8,616,4.318965517241379

1544263,5,B00005JNS4,"Ed was one of those shows that just sucked you in from the beginning.  It had a great story line and it was not full of all the garbage that is out there today.  No aliens, no serial killers, no stupid remakes of a show already cancelled.  It was romantic and made you fall in love with every character.  I am sad to say that although I saw 97% of the episodes, I missed the Series Finale.  After all those years of wondering if in fact Ed an Carol would ever marry I missed the final episode where they did.  Please put Ed on DVD.  It would be financially beneficial for you and fufilling to the many Ed fans out there.

1544264,5,B00005JNS4,"I have gone far too long waiting for this to come out on DVD. I could always relate to Ed, and so I loved watching his struggle to win the woman of his dreams. Please, I beg of you, release this right now. I will order IMMEDIATELY!!!!",1121644800,7,234,4.0
1544265,5,B00005JNS4,"A long time Ed fan, I am still waiting to see how it ends!

WSe have not had much luck in Australia, as this wonderful show is constantly shunted around for the latest flavour of the month. I would love to see how it all finishes and would definatley buy it on DVD- so please bring it out!!",1121212800,6,290,4.0
1544266,4,B00005JNS4,"Ed. A show as simple as it's name but so heartfelt, funny and amazing in so many ways. From the story of small town life to one of a man and his high school crush everything about the show can appeal to any viewer. The cornerstone of the show is Ed (Tom Cavanagh), who's James Stewart-like goofiness and boy next door appeal draws you in and makes you fall in love with the character. This is why the viewer roots for him in his relentless pursuit of Carol (Julie Bowen), the girl he idolized in high school. Though the complex relationship between Ed and Carol is the backbone of the plot, it's the crazy antics of Ed and his best friend Mike that makes the show so charming. Anyone who has watched the show immediately thought of `ten dollar bets' when reading that last line. Their goofiness is what made me love this show so much. From throwing hundreds of waffles on Carol's roof, to crazy jimmy the horse, to dressing up as the human box for Halloween the show never ceases to be creative and funny. This is one of the few shows where I actually laughed out loud at the jokes. There is no way that I can convey how much I enjoy this show in a few words, basically it's all little things I like about any TV show tied up in one little package. It disgusts me that a show like fear factor is still aired, but Ed got trashed. Hopefully they release it on dvd soon so that I can enjoy all those priceless Ed moments again.",1120521600,5,1424,4.238970588235294
1544267,5,B00005JNS4,"I love Ed.  I watched all four seasons on NBC, and when I found out it would be replaying on TBS I was estatic.  Every once in a while a truely great show comes on, and Ed is one of them. It is basically the perfect show, a combination of funny and sweet.  Every girl wants to meet a guy like Ed, who would be willing to dress up in a knight's suit just to get her attention.  Shirley and Mike are both hilarious, and I love the $10 bets.  This show HAS to come out on DVD, it would be a sin if it didn't!!!",1120435200,7,507,3.7452830188679247
1544268,5,B00005JNS4,"I am hooked on reruns of ""Ed."" I watch it everyday during my lunch hour and love it, but hardly ever get to finish an episode. It's pure torture. I never saw the show when it was on the air, and want very badly to see all the episodes from beginning to end. Ed's character is a goofy, kind-hearted, lovable, genius, and I love his reliationship with Carol. But all the other characters are great as well. So please, I beg you, release the TV series ""Ed"" to DVD!",1119398400,9,461,4.191011235955056
1544269,5,B00005JNS4,"Ed was my favorite time of the day. I have loved Tom Cavanagh since I first saw him arrive in Stuckeyville. Ed had some fantastic writers who knew every woman wants an Edward Jeremy Stevens in their life. Tom's amazing likeability was the heart of the show. His friendship with Mike made us fall on the floor laughing and his love for Carol melted our hearts.

I WANT This show (ALL FOUR SEASONS) on DVD.

I will buy all 4 and remember all the good times we had",1119312000,7,461,4.2272727272727275

It was one of the bright spots in more than a few great shows from the 90s that were cut short way too soon.  I really wish I could share this show with my wife, who is from Russia and never got the chance to see it.  I think it is about time Ed got the DVD treatment.",1504742400,9,342,3.7222222222222223

There is no other show quite like this one, it truly was an intelligent and funny gem of a show. At least Tom Cavanagh is still acting (love him as Dr. Wells in The Flash). Still, it's little comfort to those who loved Ed and who now have to reconcile the fact that it is a forgotten treasure. *sigh*",1434499200,16,453,4.101123595505618
