1884859,5,B00009MEGD,"this collection of old t.v. shows is just what a family put out with the state of todays t.v. is looking for. with great transfers and some of the best shows from the old days,and you have a family t.v. night without fear of unwanted content!!! a great buy!!!!!!",1149033600,7,262,4.36734693877551
1884860,5,B00009MEGD,"Our family has had a lot of enjoyment from this DVD set, it is so refreshing to have a good laugh over normal situations without offensive words and behaviour. We never watch TV (there is so little worth watching) but our teenage sons have sat with us and really enjoyed these old shows and it has sparked great conversations over our childhood.  Thank you for making these available, we would certainly purchase more of the old ""family friendly"" DVD sets.",1142726400,10,456,4.7
1884861,4,B00009MEGD,"I only recently added this DVD set to my (small) collection, so haven't watched every episode, but what I have seen I have really enjoyed, and I would definitely recommend it.

Six of tv shows in this collection I wasn't familiar with, basically because they aired before my time!!!  The 4 others (Andy Griffith, Petticoat Junction, The Lucy Show and Beverly Hillbillies) I am familiar with because they have been shown on Pay TV in recent years.

The image and sound quality of the episodes is excellent - obviously though the ones filmed in 1922 etc, and some of the earlier Burns and Allen episodes are not as clear as what we are used to today.

FYI - I have included episode lists for each show - (personally I find them useful - can save doubling up if you already have some of the shows).  I have followed this with any comments.

Andy Griffith (B/W)

Rafe Hollister Sings, Class Reunion, The Big House, A Wife for Andy, Mountain Wedding, Opie and the Spoiled Kid, Andy Discovers America, Aunt Bea's Medicine Man, The Darlings are Coming, The Great Filling Station Robbery, The Loaded Goat, High Noon in Mayberry, Barney's First Car, Andy's English Valet, Dogs Dogs Dogs, The Rival

Petticoat Junction (B/W)

Bobby Jo and Beatnik, Last Chance, Please Buy Violets, Kate's Recipe

The Lucy Show (Color)

Lucy (L) the Star Maker, L meets Robert Goulet, L gets Jack Benny's Account, L & Sheldon Leonard, L the Bean Queen, L meets the Law, Viv visits L, Mainstreet USA, L & the Submarine, L meets Tennesse Ernie Ford, L gets caught in the Draft, L gets a roommate, L & Carol (Burnett) in Palm Springs, L & Paul Winchell, L flies to London, Little Old L, Rind a Ding Ring, L gets Trapped, L the Babysitter, L & Phil Silvers

Beverly Hillbillies (B/W)

Jethro Goes to School, Pygmalion & Elly, Elly Races Jethrine, The Great Feud, Home for Christmas, No Place Like Home, Jed Rescues Pearl, Back to Californny, Jed's Dilemma, J saves the Drysdale's Marriage, Elly's Animals, Jed Plays Solomon, Duke Steals a Wife, Jed buys the Freeway, Jed becomes a Banker, Family Ties, Jed pays his Income Tax, Clampetts are Overdrawn, The Giant Jackrabbit, The Clampetts and the Dodgers.

The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (B/W)

Maid of Honor, Rick Grows a Beard, Be on Time, Rick's Riding Lesson, Busy Christmas, Late Christmas Gift, Ballerina, David Goes Back to Work, A Painting from the Past, A Lamp for Dave and June

I didn't realize that the Nelsons are a real family.  Before the credits I thought they were different actors playing a family.  I also liked that each episode is 'brought to you by' Sponsor's Name, and that they do a short ad for the sponsor before the show starts.

Burns and Allen (B/W)

Bank President, Breaking up the Team, Mailman and the Divorce Attorney, Surprise Birthday Party for Harry, Free Trip to Hawaii, Gracie's Checking Account, Harry Morton's Male Secretary, The Income Tax Man, Space Patrol Kids Visit, Teenage Girl Spends the Weekend.

I loved how they also incorporated their sponsor's ad into their sketches. As well, an ad break (1 or 2 of them), about one of their sponsor's products, is also included in each episode.  I am so glad they didn't cut these out.  They are great to watch.

The Dick Van Dyke Show (B/W)

Hustling the Hustler, Bank Book, The Night the Roof Fell In, Never Name a Duck, Show Me Your Walls.

The Little Rascals (B/W)

Bear Shooters, Official Officers, Spook Spoofing, Lazy Days, Mary Queen of Tots, Dogs of War, Derby Day, Sundown Limited, Fly My Kite, The Pooch, Waldo's Last Stand, School's Out, The Fourth Alarm, Olympic Games, Our Gang Follies.

The episodes range from 1922 to 1938, the earlier ones being silent.  I particular enjoyed the episodes (of the ones that I have seen), because apart from the story line, it is interesting to see the landscape of that time.  I thought that some of these episodes looked like they weren't filmed in a studio, but in the streets (I could be wrong).

* * *

The disappointing aspect of the DVD's, and why I gave a 4 star rating instead of a 5, is because they changed/omitted the opening/closing theme song (for some shows) that we are probably all familiar with.

In particular, the Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction, have the same shortened banjo tune at the beginning, instead of, in the case of the Beverly Hillbillies:

Come 'n listen to my story 'bout a man named Jed

A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed ... etc.

I really like the beginning and ending theme songs for tv shows, so it was disappointing that they omitted these.

I obviously can't comment on the theme songs for the shows I am not familiar with, but I am thinking that perhaps a part of it was cut out, because they were rather short.

In the case of Ozzie and Harriet and the Dick Van Dyke Shows, for example, it begins with the announcer introducing the family.

The set comes on 10 double sided DVD's.  They are very well protected and are packaged in a hard vinyl case.  However, be careful when removing a DVD from its plastic pocket - it is virtually impossible to remove without putting your fingers on the DVD!!!

All in all, an excellent collection, which I am really glad I purchased.  In fact, I will probably buy more Andy Griffith, Dick Van Dyke and Ozzie and Harriet DVD's in the future.",1129939200,90,5397,4.628811777076761
1884862,4,B00009MEGD,"SONY has decided quite arbitrarily to rip-off Karajan followers by allocating quite short works to this series which offers concerts by the maestro mainly from the 80's. The EROICA is under an hour in length, and dvd's are known to have a potential playing length well in excess of that. Issued at the same time as this, SONY has released PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION, a work which would have fitted nicely onto the end of the EROICA ( those works have nothing in common, but who cares!)

The performance itself ? Nothing short of revelatory. You are not likely to see or hear a reading of the tragic slow movement which digs as deeply as this one. Karajan and his orchestra present a very profound experience ; the visual aspect of the performance helps us to see the emotion being poured into this sublime movement, and the intense response from the players. The first movement doesn't exactly ignite initially, but it soon gathers steam, and the Karajan charisma settles in for a coda which blazes its way to the final chords. The third and fourth movements are beautifully played, too.

I have the impression this performance was not manipulated as much as the others in this series. Karajan's directorial style leaves much to be desired at times, with rows of musicians lined up as if marching to his beat ( the lighting in some of these videos is bizarre). However, the Eroica is different : much more enjoyable.

I cannot recommend this dvd enough. It will offer the viewer/listener a deep and lasting reading of this magnificent work.",1108425600,25,1539,4.735074626865671

7991583,5,B00009MEGD,"You can't go wrong with any of the 50 packs! You may get a couple of duds, but who cares! Show me a better deal! Some reviews mentioned picture or sound quality being an issue. Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation! I own close to 20 of these 50 packs and I'm glad I bought every single one of them!",1424390400,,687,4.212121212121212
7991584,2,B00009MEGD,"NOT WHAT I  SEARCHED FOR! So disappointed.
It is NOT Nanny and the Professor.  I Searched Amazon for ""Nanny and the Professor"" and somehow came up with this.
I have not opened the box, It was not expensive, so I won't bother. BUYER BEWARE or LOOK CLOSER.  My fault entirely, just wondered HOW THIS GOT RELATED TO  ""Nanny and the Professor""  I did a search now and it is not available except thru a cancer site. There is a Nanny and the Professor ""based on the hit TV series"" I looked closer and it mentions pages being clean--so that is a book.
Too bad, me and my now grown children enjoyed the show.
HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN GET THE SERIES FOR $35.--
I won't

and  just  did the search again --""all departments"" for nanny and the professor--and classic tv shows wound up in that list--
--just how i ordered it.
mystery solved.

7991585,3,B00009MEGD,"For a very condensed over-view of American comedy, this is not too bad.  You must remember that 100 years is being condensed into 120 minutes, no small task for the editors.  I do think they tried too hard to include absolutely every comedian of any note, even though now they are forgotten.  For the student of comedy, this might be useful, but for the rest of us,  it's too much info.  The DVD I watched had good quality clips.  I was actually amazed at the quality of the very old film clips, quite sharp and clear.  Yes, there were a few of really poor quality, including some newer ones in color, but these did not appear often.  For what it says it is, I think it's a pretty good video.  I did not know that Mae West wrote her own scripts, for example.  The clips do come fast and furious, probably one each 13 seconds.  So you get an idea of what you're in for.",1365897600,,868,4.2
7991586,5,B00009MEGD,"I give this the full 5 star rating because there is a nice variety of programs, the dvds are packaged nicely in a smaller clam shell case with pocket holders and the shows all are decent quality in sound and video. Classic television shows the whole family can enjoy.",1361836800,2,267,4.469387755102041
7991587,4,B00009MEGD,I agree on one reviewer that the opening themes were different on some shows specially on petticoat junction  I saw the show on tv land and the opening was different looked like toward the end of the show. The Andy Griffith Show was good The Lucy Show was great watching Beverly Hillbillies now. Haven't watched the others yet,1357603200,,326,4.620689655172414

7991589,1,B00009MEGD,"I purchased the DVD based on the description, which leads the reader to believe the disk contains excerpts and scenes from the great and memorable and historic motion picture comedies.
That impression is enhanced by the fact it is a 2-Hour DVD.
It is NOT AT ALL WHAT IS DESCRIBED! It is just a SPOKEN, LONG-WINDED monologue with ONLY FRAGMENTS of SOME of the comedies.
The definite impression I got watching the DVD is that it could well have been a term paper or a thesis done by a student in a Motion Picture curriculum.
And WORST OF ALL, because it is a DVD, and because in order to view it, the packaging must be opened, IT IS NOT RETURNABLE.
I feel like I could just have well simply BURNED MY MONEY because the DVD is NOT AT ALL what it is presented to be, EVEN THE DESCRIPTION ON THE PACKAGE ITSELF IS MISLEADING!
And the final point is there is an Internet website address on the package, but that website DOES NOT EXIST!
I wish Amazon could do a better job of displaying accurate descriptions.
If you want a SPOKEN vaguely general ""history"" of motion picture comedy, this might satisfy you. But if you want to ACTUALLY VIEW clips or excerpts, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!
I definitely do not blame the vendor, because they did not know the DVD was bogus.",1274918400,6,1275,4.406779661016949
7991590,5,B00009MEGD,"As a whole, I'd say this set is excellent. There are a number of good episodes of shows. I enjoyed that very much. However, the set does have a couple of old programs that weren't very popular, even when originally aired. However, the enjoyment I received from watching a number of my old favorites more than made up for that. I rate this a must see. I hope they make more sets like this with more programs.",1168300800,7,407,4.298701298701299
