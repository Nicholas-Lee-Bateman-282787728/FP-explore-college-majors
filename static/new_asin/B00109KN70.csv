8237450,5,B00109KN70,"I have been doing this video for 2 months with a friend.  Neither of us have exercised in a long time so we wanted to start slow.  This is a short, not too difficult, easy to follow video. I was already at my goal weight and just wanted to tone up.  It didn't feel like it was doing any good until I measured after 6 weeks.  3 1/4"" off my waist and 1""1/4 inches off my hips. I am now tracking down a copy for my daughter and granddaughters.",1425600000,,440,3.9101123595505616

Love this video.  The results were quick and very effective.  Sara Ivanhoe explains the postures that she is using in detail and explains what you should be doing in great detail so you get the results you want.",1346889600,,393,7.340425531914893
8237455,5,B00109KN70,I picked up this DVD to help me strengthen my lower back. It is a good quick workout and I even noticed a reduction in my belly fat. I really enjoyed doing this workout and like that it is just 20 minutes!,1308700800,,205,3.9047619047619047
8237456,3,B00109KN70,"Overall, I feel that while this isn't a bad yoga DVD to have in your collection, it isn't one of the best either.  As you might expect from the title, it's an extremely short workout which focuses on working only one part of your body (the abs).  All of that would be fine, however, I don't feel like the DVD really ever gets to a point where you're working hard and it doesn't have a great variety of movements.  Perhaps that's just the nature of ab exercises, but I would have liked to break a sweat and do more unique moves.  Below I've provided a  breakdown of the DVD chapters and a pro/cons list.

CHAPTERS
(Note:  In terms of the chapter numbers you'll see on the info screen of your DVD player, these are all off by one because the beginning title sequence is chapter 1, followed by Sara's introduction in chapter 2.  I.e., if you want to go to chapter 2, Core Warm Up, you actually need to go to DVD chapter 3.  However, if you're just choosing your chapter from the chapter selection screen, this shouldn't cause any confusion.)
1.  Introduction - Sara's introduction of the DVD. (1.5 minutes)
2.  Core Warm Up - standing - side leans, side twists, side twists with knee lifts (4 minutes)
3.  Core Work - sitting - side twists, forward bends, back arching and rounding, lifting yourself crosslegged;  hands and knees - back arching and rounding, knee to forehead (5.5 minutes)
4.  Deep Core Work - hands and knees - downward facing dog, plank, knee to forehead, downward dog with leg lifted; sitting with knees up - back arching and rounding, side twists, boat pose, boat pose with side twists; lying on back - bicycle, bicycle with legs pointing up (6 minutes)
5.  Upper Abs Work - lying on back with knees up - half sit ups, half sit ups with legs pointing up, leg twists (3 minutes)
6.  Letting Go - mudra (meditation with hand gesture) (1 minute)
Total:  21 minutes

PROS
- For a few of the harder moves, the instructor reminds you that it's okay if you can't perform them and tells you what you might do instead during that time.  However, most of the moves will be possible even for a beginner.
- Overall, the instructor does a good job of talking you through the movements.  The movements in this video don't really require much explanation, though.
- In conjunction with other DVDs (such as some with more strenuous workouts), I think this DVD could be good to have.  I just don't feel like it's good for much on its own.

CONS
- Although she's not bad for an exercise video instructor, I do find the instructor's voice to be a bit annoying.  Mostly, though, I just wish she wouldn't keep saying the same things over and over again, like ""stretch out the work that you've done.""
- The Deep Core Work section involves mostly plank and downward dog movements, which can be really hard on the wrists.
- Throughout the DVD there is a Natural Journeys logo in the bottom righthand corner of the screen and the DVD ends with a message encouraging you to buy Natural Journeys yoga equipment.
- Maybe it's just me, but I actually prefer if yoga videos aren't set on a beach with cheesy instrumental music.  The DVD has an option to have only music, no narration, but I'd rather have a no music, only narration option.  The workout with no narration is weird anyways since it's the exact same video so you still see her talking but no words come out of her mouth.
- The points at which the DVD changes from one chapter to the next seem oddly placed.  Sometimes the chapter break is in the middle of a particular type of workout (like the division between the Core Work and Deep Core Work sections or the division between the Deep Core Work and Upper Abs Work sections).  Although those chapters seem to be titled to indicate a break between types of exercise, in reality the chapter breaks happen in the middle of something.  I'd rather the creators of the DVD waited until the next logical point to split the chapters, such as when the instructor moves from her hands and knees to her back.
- Most importantly, the workout never reached a point where I really felt like I was working hard or breaking a sweat.  I find it hard to believe that I'll get any real result from this DVD.",1208822400,8,4191,4.456094364351245
