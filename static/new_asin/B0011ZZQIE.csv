8359246,4,B0011ZZQIE,"This is an excellent and informative dvd. It is instruction material for medical officers during WO II. The clarity on what is now called PTSD is moving. No discussion like if and when, but straight forward factual information in an artificial setting of a psychiatric ward.
A straightforward statement that healthy persons are psychologically damaged when they take part in warfare over a prolonged period of time. What was not known at that time, was that greater psychological damage is done by killing than by being shot at in healthy individuals.
When you are interested in the effects of warfare on the individual mind and you have a historical interest in the mental history this is a great dvd.",1201132800,,702,4.907563025210084
