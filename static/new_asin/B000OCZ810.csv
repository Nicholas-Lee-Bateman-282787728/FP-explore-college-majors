8184498,5,B000OCZ810,"This is an old recording, the video quality is washed out. They could re-release it with boosted saturation. However, it's a cute little opera, and entertaining along with a reasonable and entertaining performance, and traditional staging as well. In addition to being handled well, it seems like one of Rossini's better works.",1378080000,,327,5.3076923076923075
8184499,5,B000OCZ810,"In this little gem, Rossini proves again that he was the master of comic opera. La Scala di Seta has better music but a weaker libretto than L'Occasion Fa il Ladro. La Scala di Seta is very funny the first time around.  The second time around one notices the careful stageing of this production and the beauty of Carmen Lavani's voice.  The other principals sing well and act well.  Corvielo's portrayal of the idiotic servant is a little over the top but acceptable. Since the situation would be impossible after 1830, the producers wisely stuck with Rossini's date of 1810.",1346630400,3,575,4.73
8184500,4,B000OCZ810,"The production dates from 1983.  Despite its age the images are clear, the color solid and the sound very nice.  The set is marvelous -- it is a cut away of a house with multiple levels and many doors for the large number of required entrances, exits and hidden characters.  The plot is simple but enjoyable and the cast handles all of the singing very well.  This is a ""classical"" interpretation of the opera -- the opera deserves to be better known",1300752000,8,450,4.451219512195122
8184501,5,B000OCZ810,"Rossini materially enlivens this mild bedroom farce. The cast handles both the music and action handily to produce no great hilarity but an undoubtedly pleasant hour and a half. The sets and production values are kept simple in keeping with the intent of the creators. While no Cosi Fan Tutti, it never sought to be. It offers no insights nor lessons for living or about life; it is all in fun....and good fun it is. At the price for the DVD, it is a bargain.",1242604800,6,459,4.411764705882353
