5231627,4,B0091481LG,"This review is for the Alpha Home Entertainment / oldies.com DVD release.  If you've been wanting to see this film and buying it is the only way, I would recommend this purchase.  Don't let the cheesy cover and its poor screen shots make you think this is an awful copy--the quality of the film is actually very good (though it has not been restored).  The contrast is very good, and the film itself (plot, acting) is entertaining.

My only complaint is the score.  This is a lighthearted, fun movie with several comic parts (i.e. Colleen doing the psuedo-puppet routine by dressing in small clothes).  Yet, the score is solemn and slow.  It doesn't seem to take into account the action on screen at all.  It sounds like music you'd hear in church before services begin.

This film deserves a full restoration and proper film score, but until that time, this edition will definitely suffice!",1393977600,10,891,4.733766233766234
5231628,5,B0091481LG,"This is a review of the Alpha Video edition of ""Ella Cinders,"" one of the great silent comedies of the 1920's. It stars the amazing Colleen Moore who appeared in many types of films, both silent and sound, but she really had a flair for comedy. I also highly recommend Colleen's heartfelt portrayal of Hester Prynne in the 1934 sound film version of ""The Scarlet Letter.""

Alpha's edition of ""Ella Cinders"" is above average in picture quality and sound. While the picture is far from being remastered or TCM quality, it is still very watchable with basically good contrast throughout. The piano accompaniment is enthusiastic and adds to the enjoyment of this swiftly-paced 52 minute gem.

""Ella Cinders"" is a faithful adaptation of the highly popular comic strip of the time, and Colleen is decked out to look like she just stepped out of the comic strip itself. She wears her black hair cut in Ella's famous page boy style and (in the early scenes of the film) wears a checked shirt and a dark skirt with large patches, just like in the comic strip.  This is very much the story of a modern day Cinderella. Ella's father is dead, so she is regulated to a position of being a servant to her greedy step-mother and two ugly step-sisters. However, Ella longs to escape into a better world and handsome, young Waite, the local iceman and Ella's friend, is determined to help her.

A beauty contest, sponsored by the town's fire department, looks like Ella's ticket to freedom. The grand prize is a movie contract and a train ticket to Hollywood. Ella manages to win the contest, much to the anger of her step ""family,"" and heads for Hollywood.

But when she arrives at the movie studio gate, she discovers that the contest was a scam and she has no contract. The guard at the gate tells her to go home, but Ella tells him that she can't because everyone back home would laugh at her.

And, besides, Ella has a burning desire to become a movie actress. She is determined to keep looking forward, and never wanting to look back into her dreary past. So she pounds the pavement going from studio to studio looking for work, oftentimes with humorous results.

I won't spoil this wonderful film by telling too much of the plot, but I will say that Ella literally bumps into silent film legend Harry Langdon at one studio and he provides a memorable cameo with her.

""Ella Cinders"" is a delightful silent film from 1926. It's the type of film that even people who think they don't like silent films might enjoy. It's also a great introduction for children to the world of silent films, because ""Ella Cinders"" is a fast-paced, funny, family film with a plot that's easy to follow and  title cards that are easy to read.

It's just an all-around classic silent comedy nicely presented by Alpha Video with a DVD case that is beautifully designed and notes on the back that are well written. So buy ""Ella Cinders,"" insert in your DVD player, settle back, and get ready for some fun.",1386374400,14,2969,4.595463137996219
5231629,5,B0091481LG,Colleen Moore is terrific in this movie.  Her expressive eyes are perfect for the silent movies.  Catch her smoking cigars with the Indians on the train!,1383955200,9,153,4.846153846153846
5231630,4,B0091481LG,It's a cute film. Kinda cheesy but then you have to keep in mind the era. It was the first silent film I have ever watched. It was cool.,1473984000,,136,3.7241379310344827
5231631,1,B0091481LG,Didn't like. Couldn't get through 5 min.,1473206400,,40,4.857142857142857
5231632,3,B0091481LG,"The picture quality is good. No audio track at all is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4 to the Film Detective ""Restored Version."" Silent movies were never silently shown (at least not when ELLA CINDERS was exhibited). It doesn't seem to be very well-restored, but is watchable and it's an enjoyable film besides.",1459296000,6,314,4.7272727272727275
5231633,5,B0091481LG,A fine film with Colleen Moore. A window to the 1920's. Good to have in my collection. The story is simple.,1457395200,,107,4.142857142857143
5231634,5,B0091481LG,"No spoilers, just a chance to see Colleen Moore in her madcap element.  Her beauty contest photo is hilarious, as are her backlot adventures.",1454284800,,141,4.875
5231635,5,B0091481LG,"Enjoyable movie and fine actress, who wrote the piano music ? The music alone is worth the price of the DVD !",1450915200,,109,4.0
5231636,1,B0091481LG,This review is for the Film Detective version. The packaging and Amazon information have that it is 75 minutes long. It is actually 52 minutes like every other version of the film. The film has no sound track.,1439856000,3,209,4.526315789473684
5231637,2,B0091481LG,Although movie's from Alpha Home Entertainment are cheap the quality of most of them is real bad. I wish the Amazon would mark on the movie's they sell what company puts them out.,1430956800,,179,4.454545454545454
5231638,5,B0091481LG,Old school silent comedy perfection. Colleen Moore is a forgotten gem that has to be seen to be respected. Here you get a fantastic example of her work. I highly recommend you experience her beauty and mastery of cinema with this product.,1427673600,3,238,4.690476190476191
5231639,4,B0091481LG,"This is a well known comedy of the silent era starring Collenn Moore.  It you haven't figured it out, Ella CInders is a modern Cinderella story.  The main character through a phony beauty contest gets a ticket to Hollywood to become a star, only to find out that the role she was promised does not exist.  Yet she manages slowly and accidentally to get ahead.  In other words, it is a satire of Hollywoodd (90 years ago but in msny ways of Hollywood ever since) and the glamour surrounding it.  It is easy to see that it was no accident that Colleen Moore became a star",1416873600,,569,4.330188679245283
8533641,3,B0091481LG,"The restoration is good but the whole film last only 51 minutes. The movie is 75 minutes long, according to what is written on the DVD case and the disc itself. It means that 24 minutes were cut off. What a rip-off ! Some reels from the original movie were probably lost. If it's the case, They should be honest and indicate that the film is only 51 minutes long.",1528156800,,363,4.2

8533643,5,B0091481LG,"Thanks so much for bringing out the silents!  It is so refreshing to watch a silent movie -- even if it is not on a large theatre house screen.  Acting was so different back then and in many ways required so much more of the actors to perform ~ as well as the crew!

Again, thank you so much!  I will definitely be looking for more silents to watch.

8533644,5,B0091481LG,"This review is for the Grapevine 2012 DVD release. More than acceptable quality print and highly enjoyable. Must have for Colleen Moore fans (how did she do that thing with her eyes???!?). Not sure what other reviewers were complaining about regarding not having a soundtrack, this version definitely has one (thought it does sound like an organ from a roller rink). This is likely the best version second only to the out of print Sunrise Silents copy.",1508889600,2,452,4.883116883116883

8533646,1,B0091481LG,"It would have been nice if there was some kind of musical accompaniment to the film . It would have been even better if the print wasn't so poorly done . I could barely make out the picture. It was extremely difficult to watch for more than a very few minutes. Even though it was cheap(9.99), it was a total waste of money. Stick with Kino or Flicker Alley for better quality prints.",1505865600,,383,4.260273972602739
