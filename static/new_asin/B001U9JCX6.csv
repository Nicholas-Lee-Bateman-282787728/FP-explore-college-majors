It is grainy, blurry and looks like it was shot at most times thru a soft focus filter.  The contrast is also poor, and the lighting is dark.  The camera is always panning.  It would have been nice if the videographer had at least sometimes shown full figure shots of the Guys and held them so the Viewer could at least better ""study"" and enjoy the images.  I would only timidly recommend this Video because it is FREE and does, after all, have the highlight of seeing some of Australia's finest looking athletes!",1454976000,2,623,4.517857142857143

3797649,5,B001U9JCX6,Reading the reviews I had low expectations. This is a GREAT movie. It's not porn. It's a clever homage to Broke Back Mountain. The anxiety and professionalism of this movie is transparent as a documentary should be. Better then porn you get to see the amount of work goes into all the people that  are the cast of this hidden gem. I need an extra star.,1421452800,,352,4.333333333333333

3797655,3,B001U9JCX6,"This ""documentary"" was okay. I used it as background music while I worked on e-mail and other projects online. I might have ranked it higher if I had actually known any of the football ""gods"" or if I had seen the calendar.

If you're interested in tantalizing glimpses of flesh, where you can use your imagination to fill in the missing details, then this movie is for you. Football paraphernalia is artfully used in frontal nudity shots to keep the documentary somewhat legal. I do disagree with the review that said that no body hair was visible. Not only was body hair visible, but the ""p___c"" body hair normally hidden by the player's shorts was visible in a number of shots (and I didn't watch every minute of the movie, so I'm sure there were many more I didn't see.

If you want something that is 100% nudity, then don't watch this movie. If you are more interested in artful nudity, along with hints and information about how they went about deciding to do the calendar, then you will enjoy this film.",1409184000,,1009,4.538461538461538

3797661,2,B001U9JCX6,Way too much talk from the newsman.  The football players all had the same body type and absolutely no body hair shown.  This is just a big tease.,1402099200,,146,4.178571428571429
3797662,5,B001U9JCX6,Incredibly pleasing on the eyes...I will buy the dvd..very interesting to see behind the scenes of a project like this,1401235200,,118,4.95
3797663,3,B001U9JCX6,"I always THINK that seeing muscular guys in a video is going to inspire me to exercise more so that I might look 1/10 as good as they do. It generally doesn't happen, but that won't stop me from watching these kinds of videos. I'm going to lie on the ground and do 15 sit-ups right now. Before I do that however, I will set my kitchen timer for 60 minutes as there is a 95% chance that I will fall asleep as soon as I hit the ground. On a positive note: when I wake up and get off the ground, I will get one good sit-up in. After that, I will have a 20-minute cool-down period, and then hit the shower and call it a day. I don't want to be too overzealous on the first day of my exercise program.",1398556800,,696,3.874125874125874

3797665,3,B001U9JCX6,was why I spent my time on it. Raising funds for breast cancer (that includes the fact that men get breast cancer). The players themselves were almost natural actors. So I did enjoy it even though it was also boring at the same time.,1396569600,,233,4.318181818181818
3797666,3,B001U9JCX6,"It was interesting to see how this is actually done (the making of a calendar) it was also interesting to watch how the guys loosened up after a while - the bodies and faces were handsome - if that is your thing, you'll enjoy it.",1394668800,,229,4.111111111111111
3797667,4,B001U9JCX6,Good looking men that posed for a good cause. It gives the players and photagraphers perspective. A variety of differnent locations were used.,1394409600,,142,5.217391304347826
3797668,1,B001U9JCX6,The men look good but there is no substance to the movie. The film could have been five minutes long and made the same point.,1393200000,,125,4.04

3797682,4,B001U9JCX6,"The lack of frontal nudity is almost too up front - obsessive?
There are ways to portray the male physique in all its glory - think Michelangelo and/or Da Vinci - without focusing on genitalia but not pretending it doesn't exist either.

3797685,5,B001U9JCX6,"Made to help breast cancer awareness and treatments.  Excellently photographed and the scenes were dynamic.

I say kudos for all the Australian Football players for being brave and concerned enough to show their beautiful physiques off, very tastefully done.  I hope the raise a lot of money for their cause.  I really enjoyed the movie.  Again, the guys should all be commended for their bravery and their hearts.
