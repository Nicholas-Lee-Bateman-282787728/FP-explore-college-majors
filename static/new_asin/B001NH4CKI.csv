What I liked most, though, were the interviews with the spiritual leaders of these highlighted individuals in the Special Features.  Each of the interviews was candid, very informative, and heartwarming.  I enjoyed this film very much!",1255478400,4,336,5.816326530612245
8326975,5,B001NH4CKI,"This film takes you on an intimate journey into the lives of three young people who chose to make their spiritual practice their biggest commitment in life. It lets you discover their worlds through poignant and personal interviews and videos that reveal passionate portraits of rare spiritual seekers. There is no one today looking at Eastern traditions through the eyes of such young and sincere people, and showing that these paths are viable in today's crazy world. Faith is rewarded with fulfillment. If you wondered whether a fully spiritual life is truly possible in the modern era, the answer is yes and these beautiful souls will show you the way.",1245369600,5,656,4.972727272727273
8326976,5,B001NH4CKI,"highly recommended - just at the right level: the filmmakers are interested in showing spiritual practice in action, as a daily reality.  the film is accessible yet addresses points that will be useful to both the initiate & the more seasoned spiritual traveler, all delivered in an unsentimental, highly personal manner.  it is a hard clear look, rare to find in this genre of film which usually sinks into romanticized idealism, superficiality & confusion between spirituality, new-age & liberal politics.  this is the real thing!!!
