3824096,5,B001W72OMC,I grew up watching these two and look forward to sharing them with my grand children. Lots of fun to watch these guys who were truely funny together!,1254182400,2,149,4.357142857142857
8347008,1,B001W72OMC,"Unfortunately, I had to return this because Disc 1 would not play in my bluray or dvd player.  Disc 2 plays but skips.  I was able to get my computer to read Disc 1 but it froze for about 20 seconds trying to read the disc.  When I played the disc back on my computer it kept jittering and freezing.

It appears these are very low quality discs.  When I loaded the disc 1 into Cyberlink player on my computer, there was no region information for the disc.",1418947200,,455,4.125
8347009,5,B001W72OMC,"The great Abbott and Costello are back! My family absolutely loved this DVD because it entertains for all ages. Maybe not for the little ones in your family, but for older kids and on up to the grandparents, you cannot go wrong. Also must mention the colorization was fabulous and very well done by Legend Films. It is important to remember before there was Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin or Bill Cosby, there was Abbot and Costello who started it all! Great DVD and recommended!",1396224000,,475,4.666666666666667
8347010,1,B001W72OMC,its been wrongly advertised as color..on playing it I found that only one disc is in color and the 2 discs of the funniest routines are both in black and white ...this is misleading and am stuck with a product I would not have ordered had I known it was in B&W,1385164800,,260,4.019230769230769
8347011,5,B001W72OMC,The old live TV with the goofs not taken out is as good as the routines which are great as hoped,1374451200,,96,3.619047619047619
8347012,2,B001W72OMC,Onely the Christmas one is colorised which was a main selling point for this dvd.  The worst thing a company can do is lie to you and loose your trust.,1365724800,,151,4.033333333333333
8347013,5,B001W72OMC,If you love Abbot and Costello's Routines like Who's on first you will love this set. The best skits from there TV show are edited down to two CD's. Top this off with the Christmas special restored and in Color for the first time and you have a wonderful set. The picture and sound quality are very good. I love products that Legend films is putting out. They do a great job of restoration and I do not even mind the colorization of the shows. It makes them seem fresh and enjoyable. You may want to note that only the Christmas show has a color and b&W version. The funniest routines are in B&W. A very funny set and very affordable price.,1357257600,3,640,4.254098360655738
8347014,3,B001W72OMC,"While I found the videos to be a refreshing Flash to the Past in Comedy, I was disappointed to view so much of the materiel in black and white.  The advertising leads one to expect a full, colorized version of the originals... not just the discs' trailers.
Other than this discrepancy, I thoroughly enjoyed these videos.  I grew-up watching these programs in Black and White.  I would have been 100% satisfied with this purchase, if I hadn't been expecting to see colorized versions.

8347015,4,B001W72OMC,"very funny!!!
Nice picture quality, not perfect, but looks great for the age of the film. The colorization looks great too. I am impressed with how far this technology has come in recent years. deff. worth a look!!",1281052800,,214,4.657894736842105
8347016,4,B001W72OMC,"Overall, both video and audio quality are good.  The DVD case arrived cracked and broken - packaging was quite inadequate - but DVD was still not damaged so I kept it.
These guys will keep generations laughing.",1273708800,,210,4.675675675675675
8347017,4,B001W72OMC,"A good package of clips from the Colgate Comedy Hour. The
Christmas show is entirely in color and is in excellent quality being done by Legend. Having watched this first, it's slightly disappointing to then watch the other two discs in the original B/W. Still worthwhile though especially for the price.
One other point, it's great to see the ""..Meet Frankenstein"" trailer in color. Hopefully the whole colorized film will soon be available.",1266192000,7,441,5.054794520547945
