8098610,1,B000CEVCD8,An awful compilation of movies.  It went into the trash!,1458345600,,56,4.6
8098611,3,B000CEVCD8,"This film tries to be the Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid of the horror/low-budget genre set.  It's an interesting idea, but the filmmakers don't quite pull it off.  I see two real problems: 1) they're trying to just cram too much stuff into it - - from dinosaurs to an old dark house story.  2) The story just isn't strong enough to support the idea -- it meanders all over the place.  The production values and acting aren't bad, and often have a similar feel to the clips.  And the clips are sometimes used very creatively.  Someone should have tried a bit to even out the clip quality, though, and not just cover it up with fake film flaws in the new segments.  The ""starring Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney"" is a cheat, of course.  Unfortunately, the clips of these classic stars aren't really well integrated most of the time.  (The Bela sections come closest.)  Normally, I'd give something like this 2 stars (for ""interesting, but..."").  I'm giving Terror in the Tropics an extra star, though, because a horror/genre version of Dead Men... really is a cool notion.  I hope someone does it better than this -- maybe even the next attempt by these same filmmakers.",1449360000,,1156,4.612745098039215
8098612,1,B000CEVCD8,This is a jok! Someone put a number of old B/W movies together to make one awful movie. The acting that has been added is even worse. Don't waste your money on this junk.,1416009600,,170,4.029411764705882
8098613,4,B000CEVCD8,Interesting salute to poverty row features.  Midnight Marquee film which gives a shout-out to the old poverty row films of the past.  All in good fun by people who respect and cherish these films and their performers.  No Alpha logo present.,1298073600,,241,4.829268292682927
8098614,2,B000CEVCD8,"I like horror movies. I like old horror movies. I thought that a movie that uses clips from old horror movies edited with modern footage to make a new film sounded like a good idea. Unfortunately, if Terror in Tropics is any indication, it is a very bad idea.

I know that many old horror movies have plots that make almost no sense. This one goes one better (or maybe worse) and has a plot that makes absolutely no sense. There are mad scientists, murders, gorillas, deformed henchmen, dinosaurs, and spunky reporters. A guy dies and leaves all his money to twelve strangers, but they have to go to his private island to claim it. Meanwhile, some thieves have stolen the map that shows the true location of Skull Island (from King Kong). Everybody gets on an ocean liner. Then they find a survivor from the expedition to Skull Island. Then Several people are murdered. Then they all arrive on Fog Island for the reading of the will. Several other people are murdered. The reporters are locked in a closet. Then somehow everything turns out alright.

Besides a nonsensical plot, the acting sucks. I've seen high school plays with better acting. And, the old and new scenes don't mesh well. They go through the trouble to make the new film look like old film, but it doesn't look quite like actual old film, and the modern sound doesn't have the same quality as the old sound.

I picked this one up for about $4. It was too expensive at that price. Really, the only reason I gave this thing as good a rating as I did is because I liked the one extra: Gregory Mank's discussion of ""Poverty Row"" films.",1160524800,6,1599,4.506896551724138
