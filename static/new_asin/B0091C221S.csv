This video is nothing like the live show.  I feel that it is a rip-off that doesn't really live up to Mr. Popovich's wonderful talents. He is a true genious, but if you want to see him and his wonderful show, go in person.",1430524800,,362,3.9315068493150687
8533996,4,B0091C221S,"If your heart breaks for homeless pets, you'll be in awe of Popovich. After watching hours of his comedy pet theater videos on youtube, I decided to buy this for a little girl. It's in three parts. I liked the last the best. First is a ""silent movie"" story of old West railroad hold up; second is the theater show acts; third is non-fiction/documentary of Popovich's Las Vegas home & ""animal ranch,"" sort of behind the scenes, how he does it, choses animals & trains them. I liked the true story the best. But if you're just looking for comedy entertainment, then maybe you're better off buying a kiddie cartoon or watching Stephen Colbert.",1376092800,2,640,4.62280701754386
8533997,1,B0091C221S,Saw the live show - it was great!  The DVD is not what I expected. Would not recommend. Go to the live show instead.,1359849600,3,116,3.8333333333333335
