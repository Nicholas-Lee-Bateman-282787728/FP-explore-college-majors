8044237,5,B0006ZXJ48,"I think this is one of the earliest Clifford DVDs, the animation is good, but the colors aren't as sharp. Anyway, it's good, but it's not one of my kid's favorites, I'm not quite sure why. The stories include Dog Park * The Big Sleepover * And Birdy Makes Three * Clifford's Doggy Reunion * Teacher's Pet * Nobody's Perfect * Clifford and the Beanstalk * Get Well. The lessons incorporated into those stories include being tollerant, dealing with change, being persistent, being thoughtful with others, and keeping your word.  Good lessons, good stories, but some of the characters display obnoxious behavoirs, and that's frankly, obnoxious.",1262304000,4,641,5.047169811320755
