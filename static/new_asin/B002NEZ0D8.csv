8375010,5,B002NEZ0D8,My favorite ballet danced very well by two luminaries.,1419120000,4,54,5.111111111111111
8375011,5,B002NEZ0D8,"classic style of the 19th century ballet. His moves are from the emotions of the players. The men  are masculine and throw people around when expressing love or anger or everything in between. Carlos Acosta, a most athletic dancer is superb at this. Likewise Mac Millan women are not fragile shrinking violets, but fiery flirts, who love and betray and often display their ""wares""  and their affairs. This is exemplified in Manon's evocative solo in act 2 with the black dress and jewels. It is one of the great solos in all ballet as done to the hilt by Tamara Rojo. It reveals who Manon really is and her circuitous, entrancing movements expose the real person inside.
This is not a simple two star show. There is fantastic artistry in the contrasting characters on stage all of whom have some ""meaty"" footwork to do. Jose Martin's Lascaut, Manon's brother and pimp does some great steps. I especially liked his ""tipsy"" dance which remained effective and under controland did not become a buffoonery. Laura Morera as his long suffering mistress is a great character actor and dancer . Morera, Rojo and Martin are from the same school in Spain and Acosta is from Cuba.
Great character performances were created by Christopher Saunders as the rich roue' who finances Manon and the unforgettable Paul Kay hurling around the stage as the Beggar Chief. And then there are the courtesans, their clients, soldiers and hangers-on. It is quite a show!
In the end Manon dies in a magnificent scene  set in the swamps of Louisiana. Their pas de deux is the crowning achievement of the ballet. (At least a swamp in Louisiana is believable; not the ""desert"" of Louisiana as in Puccini's opera "" Manon Lescaut""

Read this part first ---- There is a problem with the Amazon system.

Perhaps more so than in most any other popular narrative ballet, Manon really tells a tragic, dramatic story. It is the story of lust, love, betrayal, adventure and finally destruction in an intimate and involving way; complete with two murders and the death of the heroine. And the total effect is expressed in dance and not in mime. Narrative ballet is a very different species than a one-act entertainment or a long show with show-off pieces for the stars. In a narrative work the choreographer must keep the interest of the audience for a long stretch of time. Kenneth MacMillan has done so in Manon with dance movements that convey and betray the inner feelings of the players in solo works and pas de deux in addition to ensemble numbers and expressive orchestral music. In his most famous narrative ballet. Romeo and Juliet numerous instructions written in great detail were given by the composer Prokofiev. In Manon, the story is from a 18 th century novel on which four operas have been write as well as two ballets. In this ballet the music is a pastiche of material from a wide variety of scores by Massenet but not from his opera Manon which tells the same story. The music for this ballet was collected and beautifully by Leighton Lucas. The success therefore depends on the MacMillan choreography. His movements are not the delicate, ephemeral classic styles of the 19th century ballet.",1410825600,4,3170,4.787934186471664
8375012,5,B002NEZ0D8,"I was delighted and extremely surprised to see this performance of Manon.  It has to be the most demanding choreography ever, for the leading dancers.  Tamara Rojo and Carlos Acosta completely immersed themselves into their characters.  Absolutely Breathtaking!  I recommend this DVD to anyone who truly appreciates ballet.",1388620800,5,323,5.666666666666667
8375013,5,B002NEZ0D8,"The story of Manon will be known to many through the operas of both Massenet and Puccini. At first glance this would seem to be a danced version of the Massenet opera as the music is by Massenet but this is a wrong assumption. Instead what we hear is an extended 3 act ballet which skilfully makes use of no less than 45 other compositions of Massenet woven together to make a very effective musical setting for this powerful ballet telling of the story.

One other point concerns the ending. In the Massenet opera the story ends still in France but outside her gaol where Manon dies in some temporary freedom. In the Puccini opera Manon is transported to the United States where she dies in the nearby Florida desert (doubtful geography here!). In this version Manon is transported to New Orleans and dies in the Florida swamps while fleeing after the killing of her gaoler.

This ballet was created in 1974 and has been a regular success ever since. This is for many reasons. The music and choreography make a particularly apt partnership and a firm basis for the story. The choreography also makes a point of being unusually inclusive of so many of the dancers. Clearly the two star roles stand out as they must but there are significant and important roles for a considerable number of supporting characters and this involves individual dancers, small groups of dancers and larger ensembles. As a result there is an increased and constant dramatic impact throughout the ballet across a very wide spectrum. In these ways this is a very typical MacMillan ballet and is constantly rewarding as an enveloping sensory experience.

As there are so many star roles I will avoid singling out particular dancers for special praise as this would be either unfairly brief or disproportionately long. Suffice it to say that all portray their roles to perfection and it would be hard to imagine any area for improvement. Much the same can be said of the settings, costumes and scenery.

That leaves us with Tamara Rojo as Manon and Carlos Acosta as Des Grieux and here one must comment that they, yet again, make a pair of interpretive actors and dancers that seem both made for the parts and also for each other on stage. Both are superlative solo artists but when put together they simply illustrate the idea that the whole is far greater than the sum of the individual parts. This is inspirational dancing and portrayal.

The imaging of this 2008 recording is very crisp, with excellent colour rendition and without a trace of movement blur. The camera work is involving and tastefully achieved throughout. The sound is full ranging and presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo and fully reveals the excellence of the orchestra which is on fine form. This clearly seems to be an HD recording and it is tragic that it has not been issued as a Blu-ray option.

On that subject, if a Blu-ray option were to appear later it would inevitably seem to be a cynical throw-back to earlier days when this double-dealing was all too common - financial sharp practice that can only sour relations between the manufacturer and its supporting collector-public who would be required to pay twice over to obtain an option that should have been available immediately. The only honourable solution would be to arrange some sort of trade-in deal for previous collectors. We shall see .......

In my opinion this is probably a definitive recording for the great majority of viewers and will probably remain as the purchase of choice for a very long time to come. It is therefore only reasonable for it to be rated at a full 5 stars.",1343088000,2,3602,4.735247208931419
8375014,5,B002NEZ0D8,"Abbe Prevost's 1731 Manon story has proved popular and inspired numerous retellings including operas by Massenet, Puccini, Auber, and Henze.  The plot of Kenneth MacMillan's 1974 Ballet L'histoire de Manon follows the story line of Puccini's Manon Lescaut opera, sensibly updated so Manon meets her end in the swamp, not the desert, surrounding New Orleans.  The ballet's music is taken from Massenet, although curiously none of the music is from his Manon opera.  The result has been well received, becoming a signature piece of London's Royal Ballet and also receiving performances by other ballet companies.  Three versions are available on DVD, each of which has earned good reviews.

The current production with Tamara Rojo and Carlos Acosta is the latest and perhaps best.  Not only is the dancing technically excellent, but the acting of the dancers is such that you become involved in the story almost to the point where it seems that you are watching a play instead of a ballet.  The effect is enhanced by choreography which contains many unusual positions and movements, although it remains closer to classical ballet than modern dance. Rojo's Manon, however, does not seem to be the creation of a brilliant ballerina, although Rojo's dancing is clearly world class.  Instead, her Manon is more a tragic figure who meets her end because she cannot decide between a life with a poor, passionate lover or a life with a rich, old rake.  Dance and the dancers serve the story, not the other way around.

Those who have seen this ballet will better understand the Manon operas; those who have seen the Manon operas will understand the ballet.  By the final curtain, I felt if I had truly experienced an opera without words.",1304812800,5,1728,4.965277777777778
8375015,5,B002NEZ0D8,"I have five ballets featuring the great Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta, two on DVD and three on blu-ray. My first was Khachaturian's Spartacus with the Bolshoi Ballet. Acosta is such an athletic dancer that Spartacus seemed written for him. I liked Spartacus so much that I got Frederick Ashton's ballet La fille mal gardee, which proved not only that he could leap over tall buildings with a single bound, but that he was an excellent actor in a comic role. Delibes' Coppelia, my next acquisition, showed that the former street urchin from Havana had a very wide range indeed.
After those early successes he has teamed up with lovely Madrid native Tamara Rojo and Royal Ballet Choreographer Kenneth MacMillan in two outstanding productions. First was Sergey Prokofiev's beautifully scored Romeo and Juliet, closely followed by Jules Massenet's lovely Manon.
The Royal Ballet has fielded a winning team. I will be first in line for their next release.",1274486400,23,947,5.038216560509555
8375016,5,B002NEZ0D8,"I am so pleased that, thanks to the BBC, the Royal Ballet is putting out new versions of all their ballets and this one was worth waiting for.  I have always liked the older version with Dowell and Penny but it's nice to see how today's dancers view the roles.
I joyfully went to the Kennedy Center last year (09) to see the company dance this with my favorite partnership of Cojocaru and Kobburg in the lead roles.  I love Cojocaru and I thought she was so perfect as Manon because she has that eternally young, very vunerable look that works so well here.  So, when I saw the DVD had Rojo & Acosta I was a little disappointed.  No need to be because they are so wonderful.  After seeing this DVD I wished I had been able to go to see both couples live.  I just love this ballet and I think the choreography is amazing and fits the music so well.
The included special feature ""Dancing Manon"" is so good.  It gives insight into how the dancers see their roles and what MacMillan's ideas were as he made this ballet.  I found it particularly helpful to hear Monica Mason who was so good in the original role of Lescaut's mistress.
If I have one ""complaint"" about this version it is Jose Martin as Lescaut and it's mostly because of his performance of the ""drunk"" dance in Act 2.  If you watch David Wall (who I bellieve originated the role) he is amazing.  And so was Ricardo Cervera who danced it the night I saw the live ballet.  So I was a little surprised and a bit disappointed in Martin's version here.  But it's a small thing and this DVD is more than worth every compliment it gets",1270944000,17,1588,4.274247491638796
8375017,5,B002NEZ0D8,"Abb Prvost, the 18th century author of Manon (Histoire du Chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut, published in 1731) probably never thought his heroine would be so celebrated - two ballets and four operas - and reach the 21st century. MacMillan choreographed the story aided by L.Lucas and Hilda Gaunt who assembled various pieces from Massenet music but curiously not from his opera Manon and the ballet came to light im 1974, danced by legends Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley.
This DVD filmed in 2008 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, is a thrilling experience at all levels. Tamara Rojo/Manon and Carlos Acosta/Des Grieux give us a most poignant interpretation. T.Rojo contrives to portray the heroine's complex character throughout the ballet and C.Acosta is like a most gifted painter giving true life to a portrait, both dancing MacMillan's difficult steps with fabulous technique and intelligence. MacMillan is a genius exploring human nature, showing characters through his choreographies and in this case Rojo and Acosta respond in a state of absolute cumplicity. Seldom can one actually feel Manon's misery and Des Grieux's extreme pain as in the miraculously danced and interpreted Act 3, scene 3.
The other dancers, Jos Martn (Lescault),Laura Morera (Lescault's mistress),young and virtuoso Paul Kay(the beggar chief) dance flawlessly and with ""brio"", underlining brilliantly the characters of their personae. This is certainly a masterpiece and a credit for the entire company such is the level of this production, from the design to the staging. Last but not the least, Massenet's music is superiorly conducted by Martin Yates. Magnificently filmed this is a Manon not only to remember but also to watch endlessly.
But, if all in this Manon is superlative, it is not less true that prince Anthony Dowell's Des Grieux remains the reference because of his unique technique and acting.",1268697600,16,1910,5.2655737704918035
8375018,5,B002NEZ0D8,"Manon is one of the few operas that have two versions of the repertoire of major opera houses of the world. Puccini and Massenet, each in its own way became the story of Antoine Franois Prvost in music of great beauty and sensitivity. But the richness of this story is just too much for just two operas. In literature, painting, theater and ballet, the femme fatale was represented. Ambiguous character, sometimes passionate, voluble and especially ambitious, please completely to the public.

The Royal Opera House has already given us a version of the ballet Manon, with production of 1974 and recorded video in 1982. The choreographer Kenneth Macmillan has a realistic view of history, shows the ambiguity of the character through a direct choreography, often incisive. Portrays the eighteenth-century France, decadent society, voluptosa, greedy. Reduce the story to three acts, but keeping its essence. His dance has a human face, the dark side. No one is naive in Macmillan's Manon. In the version recorded in 2008, he makes a reading of the work, modernizes the ballet, the story updates and expands the emotions. Abuses of the ""Pas de deux, the work presents four of them. All well-choreographed steps of mixing contemporary dance with ballet ballet.

The musical adaptation of Leighton Lucas does not just play the beautiful melodies of Massenet. Use themes to define characters, remembering scenes. In the best Wagnerian style, the ""lietmotivs"" are present at all times. Combining with the atmosphere and hit the dance. Mission of the hardest hit is music and dancing, that because the songs were composed for other purposes. In ballet, Manon, music and dance are a perfect marriage. Whole range of beautiful melodies of the composer was seized from 11 operas, orchestral suites and pieces for a corner.

The soloists are first rate. Tamara Rojo is a Bengalese naivety that part of the cunning with ease. His character explodes with sensuality, woman who knows what he is capable and gets what he wants with her beauty and charm. Dance gracefully, spontaneous, and a security seldom seen. Manon manifests facial expressions and the lightness of the steps. Convinces as an actress and dancer, sometimes innocently, other times with gallant and often with sexuality. A modern dancer, in tune with what's current in their midst and fully capable of doing so.

The Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta is of international importance. Its distinguishing feature is the technique, enhanced by the Russian school and transmitted via the Cuban socialist revolution. Something good was Fidel. Charismatic, strong. Tamara Rojo makes look mild in his strong arms. Her arabesques are captivating, his interpretation is convincing. Manon is ballet that requires technical and the playability, Acosta and Rojo can it with praise.

Joseph Martin is a fanfaro Lescaut. His scene of Act II is its height. The character appears drunk, dance and comedy so much laughter. Only funny scene in the middle of a ballet that stands out for its seriousness and self-interest.

The three acts of Manon are presented in just over two hours, no need to write in two DVD extras show the creation of the work, but without subtitles. The direction of the hit TV outlets, the picture and sound are excellent. The scenarios contrasted with light sometimes heavy costumes, portray the eighteenth-century Paris. The light is dynamic, it assists the development of the plot. Tends to orange, clear, clean, attractive. The orchestra has excellent sound, Martin Yates takes softness and strength, as needed.

Manon a really unforgettable.

Manon-Ballet com a melodia de Massenet.

Manon  uma das poucas peras que tem duas verses no repertrio dos grandes teatros lricos do mundo. Puccini e Massenet , cada um a seu modo transformou a histria de Antoine Franois Prvost em msica de grande sensibilidade e beleza. Mas a riqueza dessa histria  pouco demais para apenas duas peras. Na literatura, pintura, no teatro e no bal , a mulher fatal foi representada. Personagem ambgua, as vezes apaixonada, volvel e principalmente  ambiciosa, agrada em cheio ao pblico.

  O The Royal Opera House j nos apresentou uma verso em bal de Manon, com produo de 1974 e vdeo gravado em 1982. O coreografo Kenneth Macmillan tem uma viso realista da histria, mostra a ambguidade da personagem atravs de uma coreografia direta, muitas vezes incisiva. Retrata a Frana do sculo XVIII , sociedade decadente, voluptosa, interesseira. Reduz a histria para trs atos, mas mantm sua essncia. Sua dana apresenta a face humana, o lado escuro . Ningum  ingnuo na Manon  de Macmillan. Na verso gravada em 2008, ele faz uma releitura da obra, moderniza o bal, atualiza a histria e amplia as emoes . Abusa dos "" Pas de deux"" , a obra apresenta quatro deles. Todos bem coreografados, misturando passos da dana contempornea com o bal bal clssico.

  A adaptao musical de Leighton Lucas no se limita a tocar as belas melodias de Massenet. Usa temas para definir personagens, lembrar cenas. No melhor estilo wagneriano , os ""lietmotivs"" esto presentes  toda hora. Combinam com o clima e se acertam com a dana. Misso das mais difceis  acertar msica e dana, isso porque, as canes  foram compostas para outros propsitos. No bal, Manon , msica e dana so um casamento perfeito. Todo o leque de belas melodias do compositor foi aproveitado, desde 11 peras, sutes orquestrais e peas para canto.

  Os solistas so de primeiro nvel. Tamara Rojo  uma Manon que parte da ingnuidade a malandragem com extrema facilidade. Sua personagem explode em sensualidade, mulher que sabe do que  capaz e consegue o que quer com sua beleza e charme. Dana graciosamente, espontnea, e uma segurana poucas vezes vista. Manisfesta Manon nas expresses faciais e na levesa dos passos. Convence como atriz e bailarina, as vezes com inocncia, outras vezes com galanteos e muitas vezes com sexualidade. Uma danarina moderna, antenada com o que h de atual em seu meio e com plenas condies de faz-lo.

  O cubano Carlos Acosta  bailarino de destaque internacional. Seu diferencial  a tcnica, aprimorada pela escola russa e transmitida aos cubanos via revoluo socialista. Alguma coisa boa do Fidel ficou. Carismtico , forte. Faz Tamara Rojo parecer leve em seus fortes braos. Seus arabesques so cativantes, sua interpretao  convincente. Manon  bal que exige tcnica e grande capacidade de interpretao, Acosta e Rojo conseguem isso com louvor.

  Jos Martin faz um Lescaut fanfaro. Sua cena do segundo ato  seu pice. O personagem se apresenta brio, dana de forma cmica e arranca risos da platia. nica cena engraada em meio a um bal que se destaca pela seriedade  e interesses prprios.

  Os trs atos de Manon so apresentados em pouco mais de duas horas, desnecessrio a gravao em dois DVDs. Os extras mostram a criao da obra , mas sem legendas. A direo de TV acerta nas tomadas, a imagem  e o som  so de excelente qualidade. Os cenrios leves contrastam com figurinos ora pesados, retratam a Paris do sculo XVIII. A luz  dinmica, auxilia a evoluo do enredo. Tende para o laranja, clara , limpda,atraente. A orquestra tem excelente sonoridade,Martin Yates tira suavidade e fora, conforme a necessidade.

  Realmente uma Manon inesquecvel.
