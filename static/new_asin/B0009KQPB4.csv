2299222,4,B0009KQPB4,"This was a very funny dark comedy murder mystery... thing. Not great, but very good; I got the chance to see it at the 2004 Seattle International Film Festival and bought it imported not long after. If you're a fan of The Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Scarface, etc., it's similar to those except a comedy. Enjoy.",1149984000,,313,4.607142857142857
2299223,4,B0009KQPB4,"""Slim Susie"" is a tragicomedy that mirrors the mood of films like ""Pulp Fiction"" & ""Fargo.""  In Swedish director Ulf Malmros' 4th feature, he keeps the pacing brisk, the characters odd, and the story unexpected.  Jonas Rimeika in his first film as Erik plays the lead as he looks for his sister Susie.  The blond Swedish actor falls in love as he discovers his sister has been murdered.  There are a lot of naked people in the film.  An unemployed filmmaker shoots movies of himself, including a romantic liaison with the sheriff's wife.  Susie is filmed in a tub, and her brother Erik later bathes in the same tub, finding a suspicious bullet hole as the sheriff walks in to investigate.  The smaller characters like the woman who works in the nursing home and the shady woman who runs the local video store where special packages are rented in video boxes are distinct.  The scene where Johan Andersson nails his cheek with a nail gun is a bit painful to watch, as is all of the phone calls he makes where he can't speak clearly and keeps being hung up on because he can't be understood.  The bodies that pile up as the film goes on seem to be accepted without much mourning or grief, which makes the comedy seem really offbeat.  This is an interesting film that is strange but not boring.  Enjoy!",1136851200,,1299,4.5085470085470085
2299224,5,B0009KQPB4,"the movie is excellent - no it's even better!!

The best film I've seen in ages..  It's very funny, wellplayed and untraditional. but beneath the surface the writer tells a story of a small girls very tragic destiny. It's very VERY moving and the mood sits with you for weeks afterwards..  Films rarely moves me, but this one sure did. tuva novotny (who plays smala sussie) is SO talented. Also check out Plsa. He's pure genius...  Okay, I'm rambling. But it's truly a masterpiece. In my mind a classic-to-be! But generally unknown, sadly..  So if I only were allowed to see one movie this year, this would surely be it!!

Watch it if you liked snatch, donnie darko, nothing but trouble, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind etc

(ps. check out the soundtrack if possible. It's filled with great songs. Also one sung by the lead actress, Tutva novotny. She sings like an angel too. but perhaps that a pretty subjective opinion after seeing her in the movie..  :o)",1124323200,5,964,4.662721893491124
2299225,3,B0009KQPB4,"Pretentious, over the top, but fun Swedish sex, dope and gangster flick, SLIM SUSIE (Home Vision Entertainment) is also an existential black comedy set in a rural village peopled with crazy eccentrics coping with boredom, depression and what seems to me, more than a borderline madness. Maybe it's the water, but something is a little off here and affecting the behavior of these rustic, rural rednecks.

Buried deep in the numerous asides is a plot: Susie, a former beauty queen is missing. Erik, her brother, returns from Stockholm to find out what happened and discovers the shocking truth about his sweet little sister.

An outrageous, full-throttle, anything goes visual style and a hot percussive soundtrack make this eye-popping, irreverent  ride a cult fave in the making that asks how to live one's life and find meaning in a dull, meaningless place.

Three stars for the inventive visual style.",1122595200,4,904,5.087837837837838
2299226,4,B0009KQPB4,"Traffic in small towns throughout Sweden is rather limited, as gas prices have been soaring for more than a decade.  People seem to stay put and go about their business, even though the life slowly pulls the individual through a painfully dreary existence.  I grew up in such a place where the theater showed movies once a week and the movies were released on video at the same time that the theater got them.  For a teen, it was agonizing, as nothing ever happened, or changed in my little village.  The only thing that was organized for youth and teens was soccer, and of course all kids from the village became a part of the local club team.  The director Ulf Malmros whom also grew up in such a place captures the idyllic small town nostalgia of Sweden in an hilariously exaggerated manner.

Slim Susie opens with the main character, Erik (Jonas Rimeika), and another character, Micke Tretton (Johan Andersson), who are introduced in a later disturbing scene involving a nail gun, fleeing from someone, most likely very dangerous.  Erik and the other person decide to separate, as Erik seeks refuge in a small local dinner where he sits down and watches the opening credits for this film, which by the way offers an amusing mirroring scene between Erik and a claymation character on the television.  The scene on the television does not exactly end the way Erik wants it to end, as he finds himself sitting in front of an unknown person with a creepy persona that demands Erik to tell him what happened.

An offer that Erik cannot refuse makes him begin to tell the story from the beginning, which starts with why and how he got back to his home town.  The story is told through a flashback that is frequently broken up by the interrogator, as he demands the truth from Erik.  Through the grilling questions Erik reveals a number of different characters from the village who were involved in the incident.  It is never clear what has happened, but slowly through Erik's story the truth emerges.  One thing the audience does know from the beginning is that his sister Susie (Tuva Novotny) has disappeared and this is why he has returned to his monotonous hometown.

The film, in essence, dwells on existentialism through the meaningless existence that many suffer from in the small town.  Malmros' story of Erik's return home travels on the edge of small town existence in Sweden revealing several of the issues in regards to the dull rural town living.  Through the characters each issue is presented in a manner of how to reduce the agony of living in the small town.  There are issues such as infidelity, drugs, reality escape, and depression, which seem to stem from the unhappiness.  Nonetheless, it is within the unhappiness where the strength of the story rests, as Malmros exploits this situation with parody.

Malmros mischievously incorporates cinematic elements from many other films such as Pulp Fiction (1994), A Clockwork Orange (1971), and Trainspotting (1996) into Slim Susie, which only enhances the visual experience.  The camerawork playfully utilizes several close-ups that naturally make parts of the scenes look disproportional, which elevates the parody within the story.  In addition, throughout the film the many characters come across as eccentrically peculiar, which strengthens the notion that Malmros' youthful boredom might have heavily influenced him in his creation of this fantastic cinematic environment.  The combined journey of Malmro's creation will leave the audience with a spectacular tale full of dark humor and existential questions in regards to what one should do with their own life.",1121990400,8,3631,4.957095709570957
8062829,5,B0009KQPB4,"I love good comedies and they are so rare. I lived in Sweden in the 80's for a year.  When I saw this movie I thought to myself,""That could actually have happened where I lived back then.""  It is an insane movie in many ways, but it is actually plausible if you know rural Sweden as I came to.  That somebody was able to distill this in a movie that is so entertaining is amazing to me.  I laughed so hard it hurt.  You will never see another movie like this one.  It is a work of genius! The cultural observation/satire is only comparable to me in American film with maybe ""Raising Arizona,""  ""Escanaba In Da Moonlight,"" or ""Waiting for Guffman.""  Adam Sandler's ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"" is another somewhat similar type film, but very different. All of them hinge on knowing the cultures and stereotypes and seeing what is really there behind the surface in some way. It ranks among the best comedies I've ever seen. Comedy is really hard to pull off.  Absolutely brilliant film that could only have been made by a Swede.  My admiration for the work is very high.  And it was done on a tight budget, too. I've seen a lot of films at Sundance that could not hold a candle to this one for sheer creativity and nonstop insanity.  It is a sleeping gem of a comedy.  If it had been done by an American with the same insight into ""American"" crazy, I suspect it would have been a huge, huge hit.",1487980800,,1393,4.311538461538461

8062835,5,B0009KQPB4,"Maybe it's fate (or maybe I just choose really, really well), but I've yet to see a bad Swedish film. Let the Right One In, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, Show Me Love, and, now, Slim Susie. In the previous instances, most were dark dramas or horror films. This time around, comedy is the order of the day. And, dear God, does it deliver! This film tells the story of Erik (Jonas Rimeika) as he returns to his spurned hometown of Varmland in search of his missing little sister, Susie (Tuva Novotny) and runs astray of drug dealers, corrupt cops, and murderous nursing home employees. Sound dark? That's because it is. But director Ulf Malmros makes up for that darkness by making everyone in the town who isn't Erik psychotically quirky. There's Tore Tumor (Anders Blomberg) who doesn't speak and is in a constant battle of wits with a screaming infant. There's Billy Davidsson (Kjell Bergqvist), the police officer who shirks his job by constantly lamenting his shame for having screwed up in Stockholm and getting stuck in Varmland as the constable. And, best of all, there's Grits (Bjorn Starrin), a constantly high drug dealer obsessed with A Clockwork Orange and amateur film-making who provides some of the funniest lines and actions of the entire film. If you like stoner comedies, film-buff parodies, or, as Malmros calls it, gangster comedies, you can't go much better than this film.",1320019200,,1403,4.85
8062836,2,B0009KQPB4,I fast forwarded through most of this movie and didn't miss a thing.  All I can say is the stars must have needed the cash. I give it two stars because Michael Nyqvist looks awesome in black leather.,1303430400,,199,4.2368421052631575
8062837,5,B0009KQPB4,"I was in the mood for a foreign film one evening and stumbled across this in Blockbuster, of all places. Within just a few minutes, I knew I would love this movie. It's a wonderful combination of small town intensity, punk mentality, and a dark, but hilarious mystery. The main character, who moved to Stockholm 3 years earlier, gets a call that his sister is missing. He returns to his home town to look for her and discovers that in his absence, things he took for granted as never-changing had naturally evolved into a sinister situation.

The characters, despite their oddity, are very believable. Two of the very memorable characters were played by local boys who'd never had any prior acting experience. I had never heard of director Ulf Malmros before seeing this movie--now I'm searching for more! The music and editing in this film really make it something to remember.

P.S. I paid Blockbuster so I could keep the movie--and though I've watched Smala Susie many times, it never gets old!",1250467200,5,997,4.790697674418604
8062838,1,B0009KQPB4,"When I started to watch the DVD, the first thing I did was watch the deleted scenes. After a few minutes, I was acutely aware that a lot of scenes had been deleted. So I proceeded to watch the movie proper. About 30 minutes later, I came to the conclusion that they should have deleted even more scenes. Perhaps all of the scenes?

I then stopped the DVD, removed it from my player, and put it back in the Netflix return envelope. I then went to the Netflix website and posted pretty much what I've written here.

Right now I'm thinking of a movie from the early 80s entitled ""Student Bodies"". It didn't make a lot of sense, but it was OK. At least it was amusing.

My take on ""Slim Susie"" is that, after 30 minutes, it didn't make a lot of sense either, but I didn't find it even remotely amusing.

It just isn't my idea of a good movie. Maybe it's yours?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slim-Susie/dp/B0009KQPB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slim Susie</a>",1247011200,,992,4.85207100591716
