The aesthetics of the film successfully mirror Apple's aesthetics and could almost pass as a commercial. And the movie is so damn upbeat that even when Apple is being criticized by former employees it seems to strengthen the companies image, not dampen it.

Okay, so I'll just come out and say it. It's a good documentary. A great one, actually.

The director rewinds the clock to the very beginning and shows just how much of an uphill climb innovation really is. There is no voice over narration. The documentary is pushed forward by interviews by former engineers, co-founders, marketers, collectors and pundits of the Apple legacy. Every last single person interviewed is refreshingly candid. Especially a former product engineer who says just how haphazard things were thrown together during his day at the company. The hysterical cynicism of this fellow is reason enough to watch this relatively brief documentary.

Despite the true confessions on such Apple products as QuickTime and the identity crisis of the company, especially in their signature start-up tune; the movie is, unequivocally, a mac altar. It is an open invitation for PC users to repent and for  mac enthusiasts to revel in their faith or simply to renew it. You'll hear the phrase ""change the world"" mentioned at least a dozen times. Maybe more.

The documentary, of course, saves the best for last (or the worst, depending on how you feel about the man). That would be Steve Jobs. Much to my surprise, the documentary seems to side-step most of the brutal rumors about Jobs' brutal personality. Maybe because enough grist has been fed to this rumor mill, or maybe because the creators were hoping to get Jobs to make a cameo in the documentary -- which he doesn't. Never the less, throughout and up to the very end, the documentary comes to the final conclusion that Apple is Steve Jobs.

Okay...so now my two cents about the whole mac thing. And, yes, I'm aware that I'm about to sound like a cranky old grandfather. But the fact is I was using macs before most mac users were born. Okay, maybe not that long. But I must say, it has definitely been, how shall I put it....""interesting"", to watch the herd finally start grazing on this side of the fence. These days I'm ambivalent about the mac and the PC that I use. When I watched this documentary, I did so, not to put in my tithes at the mac altar, but just to see what I've missed in the past five years after taking my ear off the ground. The answer: not much. You don't need to have your ear to ground to know about the ipod and iphone craze. This documentary is less interested in the profundity of the mac, and more interested in its enduring novelty. Consequently, it feels like a dignified infomercial, which would make it the only infomercial that I watched in its entirety.",1252368000,10,2996,4.675521821631879

8316494,5,B001KWT5XU,"This is an excellent movie length documentary.  Having lived through all of Apple's history (had my first Apple II in 1978), and worked in the software industry with guys like Kawasaki, etc. watching this brought back a lot of great memories.  Particularly of the 1990s which was a very interesting time to be a Mac developer.  This movie really does give a fair and objective view of the history of Apple & the Mac, in its good and bad times.  It really shows some footage and history that I haven't seen anywhere else, and has interviews with folks that really were critically important to the very products we use today, yet are seldom celebrated.

So get this movie.  You'll like it.  And if you liked it, try ""Indie Games - The Movie"".  :)",1350777600,,744,4.541353383458647
8316495,5,B001KWT5XU,"As a life-long PC user, I found Welcome to Macintosh a great history lesson on the basics of Macintosh's beginnings. Steve Jobs is not the main focus of this film. It is more about the brand, it's followers and the companies growth over the years. It goes into the rolls everyone who was involved with Macintosh's beginnings played.

The good and the bad are both portrayed. Former programmers who worked with the company speak openly about how the company could have been better at different points in history. What makes this documentary a pleasure to watch is while both the good and bad aspects are covered, this film doesn't get too one sided. It neither bashes nor overly praises the company or it's founders. It remains remarkably light hearted and is quite humorous.

A lot of Mac history is packed into this one film. The stories behind the different Mac computers that have been created, the founders, programmers, cult followers and commentary by people who worked for Macintosh are all found in this documentary. A lot is covered, but the director does a terrific job of putting it all together. This film will be enjoyed best by those who have a passion for computers, but can very easily be understood by almost any audience.",1318291200,,1239,4.785046728971962
8316496,5,B001KWT5XU,"Like all things Mac, this is a one-sided look at the global love affair with Apple.  That's OK, though.  If you have a Mac and want to understand just how it became such a good machine, get this DVD.
