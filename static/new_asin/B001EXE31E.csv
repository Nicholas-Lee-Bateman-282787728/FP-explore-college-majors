The 1080i video is very good, the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD music is very good, and even the crackling of the fireplace is very good. The fireplace is so realistic that my kids and I found that we experience a strange warm sensation when we walk by the lcd tv. Go figure...",1227139200,14,354,4.378787878787879
3557929,5,B001EXE31E,"The Yule Log: Christmas By The Fireplace is perfect for the holidays or whenever!  The soundtrack offers 3 options:  Christmas music and fire crackling, music only, or fire crackling only.

The fireplace footage is so realistic and it seems as though the fire flames are dancing along with the beat of the music.  The music soundtrack is mostly instrumental with a few songs with lyrics (Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer by Ray Charles, We Wish You A Merry Christmas, etc.).  The Christmas songs featured offer a well-rounded soundtrack mixed with vocals, piano, jazz, and orchestra.  Top notch!

The Soundtrack Includes:
Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer
Away In A Manger
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
Mary Had A Baby
Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring
O Holy Night
The First Noel
O Come All Ye Faithful
Ave Maria
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing (Medley)
Silent Night
March From ""The Nutcracker""
Angels We Have Heard On High
Carol Of The Bells
We Three Kings
What Child Is This
Here We Come A Caroling
Sleigh Ride
Go Tell It On The Mountain
O Holy  Night
O Come O Come Emmanuel
In The Manger
Joy To The World
O Little Town Of Bethlehem
Angels We Have Heard On High
Good King Wenceslas
We Wish You A Merry Christmas

3557930,4,B001EXE31E,"Image is first rate. Too bad the soundtrack didn`t follow. Song selections are too jazzy and not what I would prefer to hear for such a holiday. Also, no vocals, just instruments. This picture with a traditional Xmas soundtrack of holiday standards would have been the ultimate. There are a many beautiful tracks that will get you in the sprit and the option of the crackling fireplace sounds along with the music is a stroke of genius. Dvd is worth the cost, just don't expect the versions you grew up with. Happy Holidays. Cheers!",1225584000,15,532,4.670212765957447

3557947,5,B001EXE31E,"When we bought this house, one of the things that upset me the most was that it has no fireplace (in an area that it snows alot in the winter).  I knew I would miss the crackling fire in our fireplace at Christmas time, but other reasons made us choose the house regardless.

So when I saw this Blu-ray in the Amazon marketplace, I was very excited and had to order it as soon as possible.

After having used it, I can say that I love the fact that you can have it going with the included music, or you can turn off the music and listen to your own music, or even just have the sounds of the fire going.

I am still not quite sure whether I enjoy the different views that are included in the video, but it is very cool to see the fire up close at certain times.  If you're looking for just a steady view of a fireplace, with no altering views, then you'll want to look elsewhere, but if you aren't picky about that, this is a great option! We use it every Christmas and snow day now :)",1393372800,,985,4.005102040816326

3557961,5,B001EXE31E,I would reccomend this item for anyone looking for a beautiful fire in the background. We had always played the yule log from the local television station on Christmas mornings. As our children grew older they slept through most of Christmas morning and by the time we opened gifts the yule log was no longer airing. I purchased this BD to continue our tradition whenever we wanted.,1362441600,,382,4.7164179104477615

3557966,3,B001EXE31E,This was a nice fireplace video but pretty standard. The best one I have found so far is Moods Blueray because it has a variety of different fireplaces and themes instead of just one scene.,1355616000,,189,4.428571428571429

3557970,1,B001EXE31E,"I purchased this as a gift for someone for Christmas. I had seen one at a friends house and loved it. However, this version is not as nice or realistic. I am extremely disappointed with the purchase. The video zooms in and out as you are watching it. The fire is constantly changing, and the image is so close you can not see the entire fire. The idea is to imagine your TV as a fireplace but this constant movement does not allow that to happen! It is poorly constructed!",1326585600,15,472,4.2555555555555555
3557971,4,B001EXE31E,"The picture quality was everything it was said to be.
We enjoyed the crackling noise associated with large logs burning and flames dancing.
However, in my opinion, the poor choice of Christmas music was unbearable.
I had to use my local FM radio station, in combination with my video, to make it an enjoyable experience.",1326499200,,320,4.836363636363636
3557972,4,B001EXE31E,"Although we could have done without the close-ups of the wood burning in the fireplace, and the song by Mr. Ray Charles (I do love him by the way, just not that song - Rudolph the Red nose), the product was a Great buy!!! The Picture quality was wonderful for 1080i, as was the music! This product can be used all year round because you can use it with or, without the music... so if you should ever need a romantic fire, or just want to relax to it: It's the product for you, I highly recommend it!!!

3557974,5,B001EXE31E,"You can hear the fireplace crackle in the background behind the music. The fire doesn't remain the same throughout the video, different shots are shown as well as different fires (I think?). The music is quite lovely. It's not at all tacky. It's perfect for a the background to a dinner or just to listen to while wrapping gifts. I'll be using this for years to come.",1325030400,,367,4.492537313432836

3557984,2,B001EXE31E,"The good news is that the picture quality is very good, which gave me high hopes when the first song started playing.  Sadly the changing focus destroys the ""virtual fireplace"" illusion and the remaining songs are nothing spectacular.  Kind of deceptive really, that it starts out with a nice vocal performance by Ray Charles and the rest of the songs are totally uninspired anonymous instrumentals.  I enjoy instrumentals, but these were bland - and so many of them (especially after that dynamic lead-in) made for a really boring experience.",1260835200,8,543,5.078651685393258

There is a wide selection of seasonal music which can either be played with the video, or left off with just the sounds of the fire (my preference for the most part).  Too bad they couldn't have included Christmas Wrapping by the Waitresses in the group.  My only problem with the whole thing was a (for me) very distracting log which looks for all the world like a large snake burning front and center in the video ""slideshow"".

I was expecting to see separate looping versions of a fireplace instead you get ONE version that rolls into another version that zooms ! how unrealistic can you get !

There is even one scene where they zoom into the char of the log... how stupid , especially on a 50 inch screen....

These scenes needed to be selectable and ONE fire at a time , never cut scene into a different fire.

The authors clearly do not understand the use of these videos. I like to pick the fireplace that fits the tv and room that its playing in then loop that particular fire , because not all scenes work .. it depends on you tv and layout... this video just rolls into one scene then the next..... just horrible.

Not one scene in this video shows a fireplace from start to finish , which should take 20 minutes or so... these fires on this video last like 3 minutes then its on to the next cut scene... really useless if your trying to create a faux fireplace using your plasma or lcd in a certain setting that creates an illusion that a real fireplace is burning in a room.... the cut scenes and zoom really are lame.
