8733578,3,B015GUYL5S,I do not know how to rate this as this DVD was different than I thought it would be. I thought it would be lots of scenery whereby I later realized it stays in one place a very long time for relaxation and this is not what we wanted.,1468454400,7,233,3.7755102040816326

8733580,5,B015GUYL5S,"With two young children we can't leave the house together at night, but with this DVD on we enjoyed escaping into nature! The Carcassonne in France lent a romantic atmosphere, with a soft wind and birds calling and the mesmerising change in shadows. We went to the South Island of New Zealand and experienced blue green water and snow capped mountains with dreamy clouds. Then crystal clear lapping waves in Upolu before we sat near the water under the autumn leaves watching the ducks. Spectacular scenery which encouraged conversation and gave us a rare night ""out""!",1451692800,5,568,4.927083333333333
