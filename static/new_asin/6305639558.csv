Frances is a cellist, playing for weddings and such, but mostly playing for tips as a street musician. Ivan is, or was a world-class pianist, but spent the last five years in a wine-soaked daze. She's blind, because of an accident, and he's spiritually blinded to everything but his debauched parties and occasional prostitutes. They come together, in a contact that fuses their music with their physical passions.

The plot works itself out smoothly, but that's really not the point of this moive. The point is Frances' emerging sexuality. It first appears in her solitude, expressed in her music. It expands voyeuristically as France listens in on her room-mate's trysts, and blossoms under Ivan's guidance. The erotic scenes are consensual and exciting, peopled with very handsome male and female figures. Frances (Lucy Jenner) may be the most enticing figure: very slender, and so unusually slim of bust that she catches the eye again and again.

The characters and plot wouldn't stand up under close analysis, but were never meant to. This is an erotic movie before anything else, and very enjoyable within its kind.

Once again, I was impressed by her talent and sexy yet underplayed (as if she doesn't know she's sexy) way.  I wasn't as impressed by the film  as a whole.  The lead male ... I had no attraction to him or his character  and wondered why these women would be battling over him.  Lucy did an  incredible job portraying a blind person and was full of depth and emotion.",949968000,,446,4.188235294117647
