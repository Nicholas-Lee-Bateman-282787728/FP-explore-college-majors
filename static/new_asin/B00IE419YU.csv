6260435,5,B00IE419YU,Tori Fouch was excellent in her first role in a major motion picture. Hope to see more of her in future roles.,1407369600,,110,4.045454545454546
6260436,4,B00IE419YU,"I enjoyed everything about this film; the actors were all cast in roles that fit them perfectly, in which they did a great job.  Yes, it's not a happy happy plot.  It's real life to the nth degree.  Scriptwriting produced realistic dialog.  Sets connected me further to the plight of the characters.  Linda Lavin is a gem of an actress.",1407196800,,336,4.533333333333333

6260439,5,B00IE419YU,"This is an exceptionally well written and performed movie.  Touching, romantic and often extremely funny.  The situations are fairly familiar -- 30-something man on the rebound retreats to his family in Florida --  but the execution is original and consistently dramatic and lively.  Sexy, too.",1404259200,,294,5.466666666666667
6260440,1,B00IE419YU,A very unenjoyable film about dysfunction. However the story-line was more dysfunctional than characters. Pass this film up and save yourself valuable time.,1403481600,2,156,5.826086956521739
6260441,5,B00IE419YU,"Poignant story about inevitable life changes, including dealing with aging parents who are suffering from serious health problems. It also challenges viewers to consider the choices they've made regarding their careers and lifestyles, suggesting that the superficial rewards are not as fulfilling as we expect them to be. Linda Lavin gives a heartbreaking performance and Kathleen Rose Perkins is a scene stealer. The bold ending doesn't resolve anything, so like the real end of life with it's uncertainties. Michael Maren scores a win with this film.",1402358400,,552,5.430232558139535
6260442,5,B00IE419YU,"A Short History of Decay is a thoughtful movie that everyone can relate to.  The characters, the dialogue, the situations will be recognizable in one way or another to almost every family.  The scenery is great (who doesn't love seeing the beach?), the acting doesn't seem like acting (kudos to the actors and director Michael Maren for drawing out these performances), and the film put lots of people to work in Wilmington, NC where it mostly was filmed.  This is one to share with generations!",1401408000,,495,4.8
6260443,5,B00IE419YU,"This movie uses smart dialogue and superb acting to present a family crisis with warmth, humor and insight. Two grown sons come to grips with both their own lives and their fraternal relationship, while confronting the challenges of aging parents.",1401408000,,247,5.2
8641441,3,B00IE419YU,"The title itself - ""A Short History of Decay"" - seemed somewhat witty, and compelled me to watch the movie. Now after having seen it, I can think of some alternate titles, however: ""Sons Make Lousy Caregivers"", or ""Be Sure to Have a Daughter"". Not clever, I realize; but ""Clueless"", and ""Dumb and Dumber"" have already been taken.

Son Nathan heads to Florida to ""help"" his parents, who are burdened with health issues. But despite Papa Bear's having had multiple strokes, and Mama Bear having Alzheimer's, Nathan functions more ineffectually than they do. He's in his mid-thirties and has been meandering thru life with little or no ambition/income, and marginal social skills.

Enter son Jack, who is even more useless than Nathan. He arrives in Florida after losing his job in disgrace, and being up to his eyeballs in debt...so he is mulling over the idea of asking Papa Bear for a huge loan. Wow; way to win the ""Unhelpful Loser of the Year"" award! (forgive the irony, please)

Despite this, I'm giving the movie a generous three stars just because it's passably amusing. I do sincerely hope, however, that filmmaker Michael Maren doesn't view the two sons' behavior and ineptness as an acceptable status quo for male offspring of aging parents.",1473897600,,1249,4.882075471698113

8641443,4,B00IE419YU,"I enjoyed the story, and the actors portrayed the characters very well.  However, I felt that it left the viewer without an ending.  Some type of resolution was needed at the end of the story.",1414972800,,192,4.457142857142857
8641444,4,B00IE419YU,"Thoughtful.  I liked watching Bryan Greenberg run on the beach.  Great character study.  Linda Lavin is excellent, as usual.",1413849600,,124,5.421052631578948
8641445,3,B00IE419YU,A little slow without a proper ending,1412121600,,37,4.428571428571429
8641446,4,B00IE419YU,"Not much of a plot here, but a wonderful character study of a family (two aging parents and two adult sons) facing the ravages of the parents' old age and the challenges of mid-life manhood.  Lead actor Bryan Greenberg, though charming, ventures perilously close to annoying in his portrayal of the condescending son, but his basic good heart keeps him likable.  Linda Lavin, as the mother with early Alzheimer's, is a joy to watch, as always.",1410825600,,443,4.815789473684211
8641447,1,B00IE419YU,"Inane script, inane acting, and dull in every other possible way imaginable.  One of the worst movies I've seen lately.  Skip this one.",1409356800,,135,4.826086956521739
8641448,4,B00IE419YU,"Recently my wife and I watched this movie. We enjoyed it and found it easy to relate to. The characters are well-drawn and the actors never miss a beat. As a slice of life movie, portraying adult children struggling to make a good life with aging parents facing end of life issues, this movie hits the mark. That being said, the movie has little to make it interesting in terms of plot and conflict and the protagonist is not especially endearing. We enjoyed the movie it is one we will probably not watch a second time.",1409270400,2,520,4.427083333333333

8641450,4,B00IE419YU,"The story of a family in distress might be the sub-title. Nathan Fisher is called by his brother to come to Florida. His father has had a stroke, and their mother is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Nathan is a 35 year old man struggling with his life. He is a writer but never seems to finish what he starts. He lives with his girlfriend, Erika, who is at the end of her rope with him, and she is moving on. A good time for Nathan to get out and sort things through. So, he goes to Florida and lives off his parents while they are sorting things out.

Linda Lavin plays the mother very convincingly. She forgets easily, but knows who her family is. No one wants to talk about what they should be doing. The father leaves the hospital against advice with no noticeable deficit except he sleeps a lot. What I noticed that astonished me was that this woman with Alzheimer's was allowed to sort her husbands pills for the week. Did she have any idea what she was doing? The older son appears with issues of his own, and here they are all of them with troubles.

This is a moving film, but one without any real convincing conversations. No one wants to talk about the elephant in the room, the talk is all done on the outside. These seem like real issues that are not handled, probably a lot like real life. Without Linda Lavin and her husband played by Harris Yulin, this would have been a nothing film. Of note, look at the authors in the coffee shop scene, they are all real authors in life.
