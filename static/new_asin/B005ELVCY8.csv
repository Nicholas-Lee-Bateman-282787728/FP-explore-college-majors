4666518,4,B005ELVCY8,"The WWII DVD series was excellent however the Blu Ray ""cover"" was misleading.  The image quality was good, but not up to expectations.",1348272000,2,134,4.826086956521739
4666519,2,B005ELVCY8,"For a person that is hard of hearing why doesn't this have closed caption?! It's hard to believe that The History Channel didn't realize a good chunk of their audience for this release would be the hard-of-hearing elderly Americans. Plus this is a release of prior release ""WW 2 in HD"".",1334016000,9,286,4.627450980392157
4666520,4,B005ELVCY8,"I am aware that most World War II era color film was of the 16 mm variety and was shot during the Pacific campaign. Perhaps there was better access to unexposed color stock on the west coast of the United States. A great amount of the 16mm and 8mm color footage shot in Europe was by the Germans themselves. 8 mm was mostly used by German officers to document their experience in the form of ""home movies."" (Much is available on The Third Reich in Color series). An interesting brief use of early color film was also used during the SA/NAZI rally in Berlin in 1933. Another bit of German film was taken from the documetary ""Good Morning Mister Hitler"" and was shot by German color film buffs in July 1939. This is in addition to the now infamous Eva Braun films and the footage shot by Hiter's pilot. Much of the film from the American perspective during the European campaign was shot in black and white and then colorized (I believe by the British for their documentary - Color of War). Furthermore, George Stevens shot much of the 16mm color film seen in this film from D-Day until the close of the War (seen in his documentary ""From D-Day to Berlin""). This is not to say that the colorized footage is not also impressive, but I was quite surprised that the source was not mentioned or the fact that some of the film is colorized. It is not even mentioned by the producers in the Extra section. The available 16mm color footage is interspersed with the colorized variety in this documentary and is used quite effectively.",1331424000,6,1524,4.505415162454874
4666521,5,B005ELVCY8,This is a must for WWII buffs like my self its gritty and has some good voice acting and its just all around a great collection to have. 5 STARS,1329609600,3,144,3.8333333333333335

4666523,5,B005ELVCY8,My family are huge WWII fans and are thrilled with this collector's edition.  I have not seen it but they were quite happy with it.,1327449600,,131,4.24
4666524,5,B005ELVCY8,"As to what is the norm from the History Channel, comes an excellent documentary mini-series! This is essential to any collection of WWII reference material or collection of documentaries.  The Collector's Edition also boast 2 additional disc:""The Battle for Iwo Jima"", and ""The Air War""-surprising and not oftened talked about facts of the Air Force's role and perspective during the war. Being a History Channel production, the various footage is blended together seamlessly, colors pop, sound levels are equalized, home theater subs get a workout.......slick and polished while still remaining informative.

  That said,""WWII in HD"" is a great SUPPLEMENT to the definitive production of  The BBC's ""World At War"". Over 3 time as much material including many interviews from various participants in the war who were from different countries.  A window into the psyche of each major country and some minor ones in the war. No offense intended in the use of the words major and minor.  ""World At War"" goes deeper....much deeper.  Own both!!

01/27/12-Ha ha, WOW..... NOT a History Channel Rep, would not have mentioned the BBC's product if I were, but thanks for the complement on my review!",1326931200,17,1190,5.18848167539267
4666525,1,B005ELVCY8,"This is truly a disappointing Blu-ray set.  Granted almost all of it is in color but the quality is typical for black and white WWII film.  Since the title is WWII In HD, I expected the quality to be much better thinking that they had digitally cleaned it up.  Perhaps I was naive about that but those were my expectations.  In addition, the sound quality is poor.  It gets louder and softer throughout the disks which becomes annoying.  At times, especially on the fourth disk which is about the air war in Europe, the background sound (aircraft engines, radio traffic, music) is so loud that you can't hear the voice over narration.  Had I known this ahead of time I would not have pruchased this set.",1324252800,11,703,4.531746031746032
4666526,1,B005ELVCY8,"This ""Collectors Edition"" is simply a combining of two ""documentaries"" recently put out by the History Channel..""WW2 in HD"" and ""Air War in HD""..both can be found on this website for less,,if buy seperately..and both together are not even worth 10 dollars in my own opinion.

I don't see how these,,""documentaries""..(if you can really call them such)....have received so many 5 star reviews. I suspect STRONGLY the persons benefitting from the sale of them have written most of the 5 star reviews and rated badly anyone stating anything negative on it...((after all it is the History Channel..so surely has many invested in it..what is to stop them?)

They both totally ""chop up""  real footage from the war and using ""hollywood movie"" style music and sound effects in background. Much of the time you will be watching one of 3 or 4 different people sitting in their living room or standing with sunglasses on while ""remembering"" their own PERSONAL stories. Most would think they are actually watching a movie on WW2 while watching real colour footage from war and listening to same accounts of A FEW (3?) persons who fought in WW2.

NOT A REAL DOCUMENTARY. ""THE HISTORY CHANNEL MAKES A MOVIE OUT OF WW2"" would be a more appropriate title for both really.",1323648000,20,1254,4.873239436619718
4666561,5,B005ELVCY8,I really enjoyed this series when the History Ch ran it. If you are a WWII history fan then this is a must-have. Well worth the money and comes in a very neat case which makes it look like a book.

4666564,4,B005ELVCY8,"So it true, that this IS NOT WW2 IN COLOUR, narrated  by Robert Powell.  It can be seen on Netflix or Youtube in its entirety, and deserves to be viewed, as it gives the chronology of the war from a European (namely British) perspective, and includes the build-up to the democratically elected NAZI Party, and their harassment of Europe, prior to America's involvement in the war.

This series does not give the macroscopic narrative to the build-up to the war.  Instead, it tells the personal stories of approximately 12 American soldiers who were stationed in the European and Pacific theaters.  I don't recall much said of the North African battles.  What makes this good is that (a) the stories are personal; (b) the film reels are in color (apparently, originally shot in color!); and (c) it tells of the realism and gruesomeness of war, including how many of the soldiers went 30 years without telling a soul about their ordeals.  The stories are VERY vivid (viewer discretion advised), uncensored, and real.  I think this was a very important work, given that many of the first person eye witnesses will be getting older and won't forever be with us.  I especially think this work will stand the test of time, especially since there's a tendency to revise history with time.  This work will keep that from happening.  Good on you producers, actors (narrators), and all involved with finding this footage and making this narrative available to those who did not live this experience.",1468886400,3,1489,4.869047619047619

4666576,5,B005ELVCY8,"World War II in HD is an outstanding 10-part miniseries produced in 2009 by The History Channel. Using color film footage from many of the major battlefields of the Second World War, this series traces the progress of the war through the experiences of twelve veterans  ten who were members of the Armed Services, and two who were journalists embedded with fighting units.

Each of the 45-minute episodes is simply riveting to watch. Many of the scenes shown are pretty graphic many scenes of dead, dying, and wounded from all sides of the conflict. Those veterans still living tell their stories in interviews. Voice-over artists read from letters and journals written by the veterans. Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump, CSI: New York) provides a wonderfully mellifluous, beautifully toned narration for all of the episodes.

I chose the Collectors Edition of World War II in HD on DVD because it added two bonus programs (The Battle for Iwo Jima,"" ""The Air War"") to the set, and would, I figured, provide video quality nearly as good as what I would find on Blu-ray. I was not disappointed. Although the 10 episodes are shown in windowbox format (black bars on the sides, top, and bottom of the picture with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio), video quality is consistently excellent. (The widowboxing effect was a bit distracting at first, but quickly became unnoticeable.)  Colors are as bright, and images are as clear and sharp, as 70-year old 8- and 16mm film will allow. Audio quality (DTS-Master) is, of course, top-notch.

World War II in HD is documentary filmmaking at its best. Highly recommended.",1444262400,4,1590,4.940074906367041
4666577,2,B005ELVCY8,"Evocative, not informative.

The series starts out in the middle of WWII, then proceeds to randomly jump between  the European and Asian theaters at different periods of WWII.

Very little attempt to is made to construct a coherent narrative *why* heroes were fighting the Evil that threatens the future of humanity.

The documentaries only explore at great length soldiers' expressions of apprehension and grief when faced with their dreadful task & fate.

At the end of each episode one can almost hear a history teacher ask ""Mmkay class, how does the battle of Iwo Jima make you feel?""",1442707200,,588,4.959183673469388
4666578,5,B005ELVCY8,"I never had the time to watch this entire series when it was shown on the History Channel, so, like most busy people in today's world, I decided to purchase the series.  If you are a student of WWII history or you just want to gain some insight into what that war was all about, I highly recommend this DVD set.  Told with film shot during the war and narrated by familiar actors, who each becomes the voice of participant in the war, it is a riveting account of the most savage war in human history.

What really makes this series personal, (for me anyway), are the accounts from the living veterans themselves.  To hear, in their own words, what they went through, what they saw and what they felt, brings you about as close as you can get to what was happening at the time.  These veterans, both male and female, knew they were involved in a titanic and historic struggle of good vs evil, even while they were in it.

That is not something that many people realize, while they are taking part in an event, until much later, when they have time to ponder what they did, but these veterans KNEW they had to win, or die trying, because the alternative would have been to plunge most of the civilized world into an era of madness and evil, not seen since the times of Ghengis Khan.  (Please note: this is what I took away from their accounts, you may feel differently).

My favorite DVD is the nearly two hour documentary on the Air War in Europe.  Being an USAF veteran, I have always been amazed at the courage these young men, (example: 21 year old pilots in command of big four engine B-17 bombers and responsible for the lives of their crews), flying deep into Germany, without long range fighter escort, (which came later in the war), having to depend on their own heavily armed bombers and those of their comrades flying around them.  I don't want to give too much away.

You won't regret purchasing WWII in HD, it is a fantastic series.  One last note, the presentation of this set, the cover, the case itself and the material used, gives it a feel of a war time issued item.  It would make a great gift to anyone you know that is interested in WWII.

I hope this review helps you.",1440633600,,2188,4.37037037037037

4666628,5,B005ELVCY8,"Yes, I did have to say that in capital letters. FANTASTIC. There. I said it again. Go read the rest of this review or I'll say it again.

This dvd collection is positively emotionally overwhelming, visually stunning, and with great voiceover work.

I am not an academic historian, but I do have a strong interest in history that I have been pursuing for over 25 years. I also write and so structure and presentation are important to me. I've seen many, many war documentaries and none have affected me the way this one has.

Let me give you one example so you can understand what I mean. The 70s The World At War with Sir Laurence Olivier's inimitable narraration is a wonderful, valuably in-depth and highly enjoyable documentary series. I own it also. Yet it is quiet in tone, distant...as if speaking to you through Barbara Tuchman's ""Distant Mirror"".

In comparison, WWII in HD is In-Your-Face, NOW, with full color and a consistently adept matching of audio, foley work, story and visual to tell the story. It's even told in present tense to enhance the effect! (a device I didn't quite cotton onto for a few episodes). The following of a dozen real men and women in their journey through the war was a great idea. You feel like you're really there. It's easy to empathize with them. No WWI or WWII documentary has ever felt so visceral and immersive to me.

The World At War's main tone was Depressing. This all happened, and we're really bummed out about it. Lots of people died.

WWII in HD's main tone is Scary. This is happening, and we don't know how it's going to turn out. Maybe we're going to die next.

See the difference?

As promised by the opening monologue, I had not seen the footage in this series presented in any other.

Point of view switches back and forth between actual surviving veterans and their voiceover actors when possible, and the presentation is seamless. Moments in episodes frequently made my skin crawl in my feelings of involvement.

The use of color and storytelling in modern mode is a knockout combination. And the onslaught goes on right through the closing credits--the producers used every available moment in each episode to do their work. They took nothing for granted.

I give this my highest recommendation. If you or someone you know has had difficulty relating to WWII, believing it happened long ago to people who somehow weren't like us, WWII in HD will get them to see it as 'real'. And that is an amazing achievement.

If I were to lose this boxed set, I would immediately go buy it again.

For the lover of history and war buffs, this series will bring you many hours of visceral enjoyment and education--I believe about 20--even if you thought you'd seen it all. You haven't seen this.",1399248000,11,2743,4.654244306418219

4666640,4,B005ELVCY8,WWII in HD is fun to watch and the images are great.  If your looking for more of an in depth documentary you may want to try thee series entitled The World at War done by the BBC,1389484800,,179,3.710526315789474
4666641,3,B005ELVCY8,A little too parochial to provide a true picture of the WORLD WAR. There were many theatres of War and representatives of many nations sacrificed their lives,1384560000,,157,4.851851851851852
4666642,5,B005ELVCY8,This is one of the best colour documentaries of world war two. There is footage that I have never seen before and I am an armature and I highly recommend it,1382832000,,156,4.064516129032258

4666650,4,B005ELVCY8,"Interesting ways of presenting long and sometime boresome lenghty war and battle stories with interviews at intervals. The graphic presentations of how each army moved and retreated helped to keep the story in session. Overall, these are valuable and rare collections of colors images at the time which color filming is rare and dangerous.",1369267200,,339,5.296296296296297

4666652,5,B005ELVCY8,"I have seen this whole series 3 times before buying it's a must have! Now after many generations later of World War 2, many people forget the hardships the service men and women went through during the 40's. This movie brings it back to life in a way that youthful audiences would find entertaining, built from the diaries of people that were there with real color footage and great sound effects! I just love it!!!!",1367193600,,416,4.56
4666653,5,B005ELVCY8,"I bought WWII in HD so I could learn more about World War II. I have many WWII veterans who come in my shop and do business with me. I've spoken to many of them about their war experiences from infantry in the European Theater to ship's cooks to combat in the Pacific Islands. Army, Navy, Army Air Corps. I wanted to buy this WWII in HD so I could see some of this close up.
I'm happy with what I've seen thus far and I will say this: remember there is a limited amount of usable, viewable film to use in these box sets. However, the best part of this is the fact that a great deal of the film was shot on color film which was a very new thing at that time. The dvds also contain colorized film but this doesn't detract from the experience.
If you are studying World War II or had relatives in the War and you want to see what transpired as caught on film, get this box set. I was glad to have found it on Amazon.",1366329600,,913,3.9405405405405407

I have watched it 3 times, and no doubt will view it again.  Amazing footage, all in color. My boyfriend isn't even a fan of this type of genre, and he is now hooked.
