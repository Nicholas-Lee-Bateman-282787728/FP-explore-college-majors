7886565,1,6305237158,This movie makes even B-movies look bad.  The cinematography gave me a headache.  The editing and shots are poorly pasted together into a mishmash of scenes.  The plot makes no sense with unnecessary nudity.  Do NOT buy or watch this movie unless you're a fan of one of the actors in it.,1232668800,,287,4.461538461538462

Kay Taggert was the lead role in the origial play but died on the opening night. Peter's performance shines as Sol Bonsky... As the story goes on.. his character tries to get his play out there again with a new face as the lead, but accidents start happening when rehersals get underway.

Enter a man wanting to investigate ghosts when claims when there are sitings of Key Taggert's ghost. This film will keep you guessing from start to finish.

 There is a sex scene in this that does not add to the story... Do not watch this unless you are a fan of Peter.. it is too bad that he didn't get a better project then this... He really was good in spite of the quality of the sound, story, and some of the actors he worked with...",1204675200,,832,4.220125786163522
