3136251,5,B0014Z3OQW,"I prefer kid's workouts over adult ones because they are usually the length I want and non-sexual!  This has VERY clear instructions at a good pace.

3136255,5,B0014Z3OQW,This is a great video for short exercise sessions.  There are a few five minute workouts and 10 minute workouts.  I have a very tight fit in my classroom.  We are able to spread around the room and watch the video on the SmartBoard.  The students enjoy doing the exercises and the fit tips are great too.,1366156800,,304,4.280701754385965
3136256,4,B0014Z3OQW,This dvd is great for 1st-3rd graders. The older kids in the daycare(4th and 5th grade) did not care for it.,1365033600,,108,4.190476190476191
3136257,2,B0014Z3OQW,I bought this video for my nine-year-old. It was pretty boring and baby-ish. It didn't provide much of a workout. Luckily I also bought Kick to Get Fit Jr. and that is way better.,1364169600,,179,4.294117647058823

3136270,2,B0014Z3OQW,I was looking for something for our kids to get exercise during the cold winter months.  This one is a little too funky/dancy.  More basic exercise moves would be preferred for my kids' ages -- 4 and 6.,1357516800,3,202,4.2894736842105265
3136271,3,B0014Z3OQW,My kids like shaun T better than this video.  It could be great for other families just not for us.,1355702400,,99,3.95
3136272,2,B0014Z3OQW,"I read good reviews that is why I purchased it for my8 year old grandaughter. I thought is a great thing to get her moving. It was so boring and very instructional, no music, movement was boring that she did not even want to watch it.",1353888000,,234,4.108695652173913

3136274,5,B0014Z3OQW,"- 6 Workouts included, most are basic enough for say a 5 year old and fun for an adult!
- 4 of the workouts are 5 minutes long, and the last 2 are 10 minute workouts
- You will get a little sweat going from these!
- The instructor in the video is energetic and keeps the pace.",1349049600,,276,3.7758620689655173
3136275,4,B0014Z3OQW,"My boys have done 2 of the workouts and I really had to encourage them to stick with it.  The dance aspect doesn't appeal to them as much, they would rather be outside playing & riding bikes, which is fine with me.  When my daughter gets older I think she will enjoy them with me more than the boys.",1347321600,,299,4.0508474576271185

3136289,5,B0014Z3OQW,"I've been teaching dance in the public schools for over 25 years and this is BY FAR
one of the best videos ever!
It's fun, it's clear, it's easy to follow and it can be broken up into short sections
for just a quick break.
The instructor is energetic and very clear - breaking down the moves slowly, then
picking up the tempo and adding it all together.
Everyone in the video is dressed appropriately (great!)
and the ""extras"" about nutrition and heart health are short but excellent.
I love it!",1306800000,20,495,4.450549450549451
3136290,4,B0014Z3OQW,"Great video to throw on at the end of the school day when the students need to move!

3136291,5,B0014Z3OQW,I was looking for a video for my kids to help them have fun exercising on those days when it's cold or rainy!  I ended up with a video that is FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!  we enjoy it so much!  i even like to do this video when i'm exercising alone!  it's not just for kids but it's easy enough that kids can catch on quick and get a great workout.  it's got wonderful up to date dance moves with great cardiac benefit!,1298937600,,417,3.9166666666666665
3136292,5,B0014Z3OQW,"Picked this video up at the library not knowing what to expect...it is  first class production.  My kids and I loved it.  They are 6 and 14, and I am 49.  We all worked out to it...had a bunch of fun, and got  great workout it.  It has different routines.  It also has excellent short fitness and health tips between segments. We love it and will probably buy our own copy.  I highly recommend it.",1292544000,10,397,4.2
3136293,5,B0014Z3OQW,This is a great exercise video for kids. The segments are perfect in length and entertaining.,1279238400,,93,4.875
3136294,5,B0014Z3OQW,I was looking for a motivating exercise video for my primary students.  I wanted it to be short to use in between subjects as a break.  This video has 6 great workouts.  It's both motivating and fun.  I think intermediate students would like it too.,1267056000,4,249,4.466666666666667
3136295,1,B0014Z3OQW,"The way this product description reads I thought it was two cd's but it was only one.  For the price I do not think it was worth it.  My nine year old tried it, but having to stop and start the next bit if you want to go longer than 10 minutes is annoying.  I don't recommend it for older kids, but probably ok for smaller ones...if you are willing to pay that much for about 35 minutes!  Unfortunately, I did.  booo",1266624000,6,416,4.024390243902439
3136296,4,B0014Z3OQW,I purchased this video for my 7 year old daughter.  The instruction is very fast.  Some of the action was hard for my daughter and me to follow (I am over weight and it was hard on my knees).  But she was interested in it and it got her off the couch so I am glad I bought it.,1264464000,4,276,3.6440677966101696
3136297,5,B0014Z3OQW,"My daughter, age 7, lost interest in dance class (I think because she could not pick it up easily), so I wanted to find a way to help her coordinate her body.  She loves this video - which is a lot of dancing mixed with some aerobic moves.  She does have trouble doing some of the moves, but I like that it gives her a challenge.  I have noticed she is getting progressively better.  The moves are not simple and require both lower and upper body working together.

The video is broken up into four 5-minute routines and two 10-minute routines.  The two 10-minute routines combine the 5-minute ones.  This keeps her attention span, unlike a long 45 minute video.  She usually chooses to do several of the routines.  There is no stretching or cool down, but I am fine with that because I am not using it for fitness but to teach my girl dance and coordination (incognito).",1262822400,28,871,4.427672955974843
3136298,5,B0014Z3OQW,"I love this DVD. The instructor has a lot of energy and gets the kids motivated! I love that it is broken up into parts too, so that way if I only have 15 minutes it's not hard to do it!",1260230400,,186,3.5609756097560976

3370750,5,B0014Z3OQW,I love to use this with my kids from Pre K through 5th grade!!!  They all enjoy the moves and I love the tips at the end.,1381276800,,121,3.4814814814814814
3370751,5,B0014Z3OQW,This is a great way to get our family moving!  Thanks for providing things like this to help motivate us.,1366761600,,105,4.25
3370752,5,B0014Z3OQW,This is a great video for short exercise sessions.  There are a few five minute workouts and 10 minute workouts.  I have a very tight fit in my classroom.  We are able to spread around the room and watch the video on the SmartBoard.  The students enjoy doing the exercises and the fit tips are great too.,1366156800,,304,4.280701754385965
3370753,4,B0014Z3OQW,This dvd is great for 1st-3rd graders. The older kids in the daycare(4th and 5th grade) did not care for it.,1365033600,,108,4.190476190476191
3370754,2,B0014Z3OQW,I bought this video for my nine-year-old. It was pretty boring and baby-ish. It didn't provide much of a workout. Luckily I also bought Kick to Get Fit Jr. and that is way better.,1364169600,,179,4.294117647058823

3370766,1,B0014Z3OQW,This is not at all what we where looking for.  wanted to use it for homeschooling exercise but far too much traditional school atmosphere.,1357862400,2,138,4.75
3370767,2,B0014Z3OQW,I was looking for something for our kids to get exercise during the cold winter months.  This one is a little too funky/dancy.  More basic exercise moves would be preferred for my kids' ages -- 4 and 6.,1357516800,3,202,4.2894736842105265
3370768,3,B0014Z3OQW,My kids like shaun T better than this video.  It could be great for other families just not for us.,1355702400,,99,3.95
3370769,2,B0014Z3OQW,"I read good reviews that is why I purchased it for my8 year old grandaughter. I thought is a great thing to get her moving. It was so boring and very instructional, no music, movement was boring that she did not even want to watch it.",1353888000,,234,4.108695652173913
3370770,5,B0014Z3OQW,This was exactly what I was looking for to use in my classroom. The videos are short enough to hold their attention and the kids really enjoy the activities!,1349049600,,157,4.448275862068965
3370771,5,B0014Z3OQW,"- 6 Workouts included, most are basic enough for say a 5 year old and fun for an adult!
- 4 of the workouts are 5 minutes long, and the last 2 are 10 minute workouts
- You will get a little sweat going from these!
- The instructor in the video is energetic and keeps the pace.",1349049600,,276,3.7758620689655173
3370772,4,B0014Z3OQW,"My boys have done 2 of the workouts and I really had to encourage them to stick with it.  The dance aspect doesn't appeal to them as much, they would rather be outside playing & riding bikes, which is fine with me.  When my daughter gets older I think she will enjoy them with me more than the boys.",1347321600,,299,4.0508474576271185

3370775,5,B0014Z3OQW,I got this for my 3rd graders because they wanted to exercise.  The 5 and 10 minute workouts were perfect for us to squeeze into the day and the moves were fun too.,1307059200,5,164,3.9696969696969697
3370786,5,B0014Z3OQW,"I've been teaching dance in the public schools for over 25 years and this is BY FAR
one of the best videos ever!
It's fun, it's clear, it's easy to follow and it can be broken up into short sections
for just a quick break.
The instructor is energetic and very clear - breaking down the moves slowly, then
picking up the tempo and adding it all together.
Everyone in the video is dressed appropriately (great!)
and the ""extras"" about nutrition and heart health are short but excellent.
I love it!",1306800000,20,495,4.450549450549451
3370787,4,B0014Z3OQW,"Great video to throw on at the end of the school day when the students need to move!

3370788,5,B0014Z3OQW,I was looking for a video for my kids to help them have fun exercising on those days when it's cold or rainy!  I ended up with a video that is FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!  we enjoy it so much!  i even like to do this video when i'm exercising alone!  it's not just for kids but it's easy enough that kids can catch on quick and get a great workout.  it's got wonderful up to date dance moves with great cardiac benefit!,1298937600,,417,3.9166666666666665
3370789,5,B0014Z3OQW,"Picked this video up at the library not knowing what to expect...it is  first class production.  My kids and I loved it.  They are 6 and 14, and I am 49.  We all worked out to it...had a bunch of fun, and got  great workout it.  It has different routines.  It also has excellent short fitness and health tips between segments. We love it and will probably buy our own copy.  I highly recommend it.",1292544000,10,397,4.2

3370791,5,B0014Z3OQW,I was looking for a motivating exercise video for my primary students.  I wanted it to be short to use in between subjects as a break.  This video has 6 great workouts.  It's both motivating and fun.  I think intermediate students would like it too.,1267056000,4,249,4.466666666666667
3370792,1,B0014Z3OQW,"The way this product description reads I thought it was two cd's but it was only one.  For the price I do not think it was worth it.  My nine year old tried it, but having to stop and start the next bit if you want to go longer than 10 minutes is annoying.  I don't recommend it for older kids, but probably ok for smaller ones...if you are willing to pay that much for about 35 minutes!  Unfortunately, I did.  booo",1266624000,6,416,4.024390243902439
3370793,4,B0014Z3OQW,I purchased this video for my 7 year old daughter.  The instruction is very fast.  Some of the action was hard for my daughter and me to follow (I am over weight and it was hard on my knees).  But she was interested in it and it got her off the couch so I am glad I bought it.,1264464000,4,276,3.6440677966101696
3370794,5,B0014Z3OQW,"My daughter, age 7, lost interest in dance class (I think because she could not pick it up easily), so I wanted to find a way to help her coordinate her body.  She loves this video - which is a lot of dancing mixed with some aerobic moves.  She does have trouble doing some of the moves, but I like that it gives her a challenge.  I have noticed she is getting progressively better.  The moves are not simple and require both lower and upper body working together.

The video is broken up into four 5-minute routines and two 10-minute routines.  The two 10-minute routines combine the 5-minute ones.  This keeps her attention span, unlike a long 45 minute video.  She usually chooses to do several of the routines.  There is no stretching or cool down, but I am fine with that because I am not using it for fitness but to teach my girl dance and coordination (incognito).",1262822400,28,871,4.427672955974843
3370795,5,B0014Z3OQW,"I love this DVD. The instructor has a lot of energy and gets the kids motivated! I love that it is broken up into parts too, so that way if I only have 15 minutes it's not hard to do it!",1260230400,,186,3.5609756097560976
