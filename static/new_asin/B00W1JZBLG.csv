7114175,4,B00W1JZBLG,Really funny and a great female cast.  They're all wonderfully bitchy...especially Vanessa Bell Calloway.  I remember her from the Eddie Murphy film 'Coming to America'.  Michael Boatman is super funny too.,1432166400,,206,5.580645161290323

7114180,2,B00W1JZBLG,"Somewhat funny, typical ending, disappointed because I thought it was another movie I briefly saw years ago, it starred Lisa Nicole Carson, a actor named Khail,and Nicole Parker among others, it was about a urban singing girl group, great acting and musical numbers, but it seemed to disappeared,haven't seen it on tv and haven't seen it available as a DVD, kinda of a shame,it's a early reminder of many of the prominent blacks actors of today that I see guest starring on many tv shows. Hopefully it will be reissued.",1461801600,,519,4.777777777777778

8711788,5,B00W1JZBLG,"I enjoyed the movie. Appreciated seeing many of my favorite female actresses I haven't seen in a while. I thought it was funny. Everyone's role in movie was relatable. I'd watch again and recommend.

The only thing I woulda changed is the name of the movie. To me the name of the movie is misleading to the plot and characters. Maybe they coulda called it Hollywood Karma.",1518307200,,372,4.552238805970149
8711789,4,B00W1JZBLG,Worth watching. I enjoyed the cast (I haven't seen some of these ladies in a while) and the whodunnit concept was quite interesting. The end of the movie was a nice twist.,1506211200,,171,4.375
