2169720,5,B00065GVIY,"Kitchen Stories is actually not about `stories', but the focus is on one kitchen where a research project is underway.  This film set in the 50's is delicately filled with subtle humor.  The quirkiness of the film is just that, a Swedish research study that involves a cavalcade of tiny trailers with a high chair attached descending upon a Norwegian village.  The high chair is  to observe the single male in his kitchen to study the moves that would help improve kitchen setups.  The observer must sit inconspicuously in the  high chair overlooking the actions of the observee and the observer sleeps in his trailer.

To add to the quirkiness is the absurdity of the project as there is to be no communication between the subjects.  They are to have no interaction or exchanges in the kitchen.  Human nature does not allow this, especially when two are in a home and often alone.  The outcome with its consequences are predetermined to fail.

Izak lives alone in Sweden and his reason for taking on the study is because he gets a horse of out the deal. When disappointment sets in, he thinks twice about the project but goes along grudgingly, as the observed and observee begin the study.

This Norwegian film is a great study for the viewer into the observer and the observee.  The movie depicts subtle humor, simple moves, simple communication.  There is not necessarily a plot, but the story is driven primarily by visual communicative behavior.  It is not slow, you just need to absorb the facts, take your time and observe!!

2169721,4,B00065GVIY,"This sweet, low-key film from Norway took me by surprise. It unfolds slowly, with dry wit and growing affection, as two middle-aged men, one from Sweden, one from Norway, put aside long-established mutually-engendered stereotypes, suspicions, and mistrust to establish a new grounds for friendship. Patience with the deliberate pace will reward the viewer with a richness and satisfaction rarely found in films today. Definitely a keeper for viewers who enjoy movies like The Castle and The Station Agent. Could easily be 5 stars were I not so annoyingly parsimonious.",1140825600,4,568,5.393258426966292
2169722,5,B00065GVIY,"I bought this movie because I am learning Norwegian and have started looking for NTSC/Region 1 films shot in Norwegian that haven't been dubbed. The inspiration for this film was, apparently, an actual study in Sweden in the 50s about how much walking a Swedish housewife does in her kitchen. The story of this film is that the Swedish government follows up that study with Norwegian men that live alone.  The observer & observee are not supposed to interact at all, but a strong friendship forms between one Swedish observer and an old Norwegian farmer in a tiny village. While there are no spectacular scenes in this story, it has its comic moments and its tragic ones, as in life. If you can enjoy subtle stories that portray the lives of normal people, this is worth a watch. Especially if you're trying to learn Norwegian ;-)",1140048000,4,830,4.684931506849315
2169723,5,B00065GVIY,"This is one of the best films I've seen in awhile.  A Swedish home economics institute is doing a study on kitchen use by single males in Norway in order to more efficiently design home space.  As part of the study, an observer must physically sit in the kitchen with their subject.  They are not supposed to interact in any way, only observe.  Of course, human nature being what it is, that's not how it ends up.

Don't expect a goofy laugh riot; the humor is subtle but fun.  The characters are likeable and interesting.  The moral of the story is heartening (the power of friendship is the human condition).  Be prepared for a sad ending, but one that sticks with you.

Don't let the subtitles deter you.  There is not very much dialogue in the film.",1132704000,6,753,4.430656934306569
2169724,4,B00065GVIY,"We humans are, by nature, a thoroughly inquisitive lot.  We can't help but want to know what it is that makes everything - including the people around us - ""tick.""  But can that curiosity, which has done so much to enlighten and advance us as a species, also wind up draining all the spontaneity and fun out of life?  If everything is catalogued and labeled and put into little boxes, what happens to that sense of mystery that makes life worth living?  The Swedish film ""Kitchen Stories"" is an ingenious little satire about mankind's insatiable propensity to study and analyze every damn thing in life and to subject even our most mundane daily activities to the rigors of scientific enquiry.

It`s the 1950`s and a group of Swedish researchers have descended on Norway to study ""the kitchen habits of the single male,"" a truly pressing concern if ever there was one. The project involves setting up an ""observer"" in a volunteer's kitchen in order to watch and record the subject`s every move, leading, hopefully, to kitchen designs that will prove more fruitful and productive for the average citizen.  The proviso is that there is to be no fraternizing whatsoever between the two parties, otherwise the ""objective"" nature of the experiment will be ruined.  This is truly life as lived under a microscope, and the question early on becomes who will be the first to ""crack"" under the pressure of this totally unnatural state of affairs, the observer or the observed.  And just how meaningful and reliable could information gleaned from such a contrived, unnatural setup be anyway?  Given the complexity of human nature, how much can such a study truly tell us about ourselves and what we're really like?

The film focuses on two men who are caught up in the study:  Isak, the relatively reluctant subject, and Nilsson, the analyst who takes up residence in Isak's kitchen, perched high above him on a five foot tall chair made especially for the occasion.  At first, the air is tense between the two men, for Isak is not shy about showing his obvious resentment of this nonstop intrusion and prying into his daily life.  But, after a few days, the mood thaws out and the two men become fast friends, drawn to each other by their common humanity and need for companionship.  Soon, they are breaking all the ""rules"" of the study, sharing food, beverages and conversation with untoward abandon.

Some people may see this film as an allegory of life under a totalitarian regime, with the individual's every move being observed, recorded and monitored by an authoritarian power.  I see it more as a simple study in human nature, as two men triumph over a dehumanized institution.  Either way, the film does an interesting job showing just how easily the observer can become the observed if he lets his guard down.  The film boasts excellent performances from Joachim Calmeyer as Isak, Tomas Norstrom as Nilsson, Bjorn Floberg as Isak's jealous friend, Grant, and Reine Brynolfsson as Nilsson's serious, Nervous Nelly boss who, like Grant, can't abide the intimacy he sees developing between evaluator and subject (albeit for totally different reasons).

""Kitchen Stories"" is a quiet, almost muted film in which the characters rarely speak above a whisper, reflecting the somber mood of both the clinical experiment and the stark winter background against which the story takes place.  Yet, there is warmth and humor in the relationship between Isak and Nilsson, and a great deal of quirky humor in both the premise and director Bent Hamer's sly execution of it.  This is a film for those in search of the unique and the offbeat.",1108339200,41,3624,4.879282218597064
2169725,4,B00065GVIY,"For years now, humorist Garrison Keillor has successfully mined the image of the ""Norwegian bachelor farmers"" who populate the fringes of his fictional Lake Wobegon.  Although few of his fans outside the precincts of Minnesota have probably ever actually met a Norwegian bachelor farmer, the vague image is nonetheless strong enough to carry Keillor's jokes and jabs.  In ""Kitchen Stories,"" a 2003 film by Bent Hamer, the rest of us finally have the chance to meet such a character, and it is an opportunity not to be missed.

Isak is the farmer in question, a cagey old man who mistakenly volunteers for a 1950s Swedish study of home efficiency.  Having already ""improved"" the domestic efficiency of Scandinavian housewives, the nutty professors of the Swedish Home Research Institute set out to bestow a similar blessing on Norwegian bachelors.  Isak is thus assigned to be observed by one Folke, himself a bachelor and a strict pupil of the official methods of the Institute's director.

While an early clash of wills between the observer and the observee set the stage for the film (and offer the early comedic bits and the film's few real laughs) what follows is the real story, a tale of human need that reaches out past conventions, artifice and rules of engagement.  Isak slowly overcomes his resentment and obstructionist bent, while Folke's pointless fastidiousness simultaneously unravels. The result is what The Odd Couple might have been had Neil Simon decided to forego the slapstick.

Four subplots underpin the story without distracting from it.  Isak's horse, a metaphor for the old man himself, is dying.  Grant, Isak's heretofore best friend, is, literally, left out in the cold.  Folke's boss, a real company man, desperately tries to hold the inane experiment together in the face of human nature overwhelming ""scientific"" protocols; and the futility of the whole effort is underscored by the Hugh Hefner antics of the project's absentee director.

The beauty of the story is in its simple portrayal of simple human need.  In the clumsy hands of Hollywood, the ample openings for an eventual homosexual twist to the story of these lonely men would no doubt be seized and exploited.  But such mercifully never develops and, like 2003's ""Cuckoo,"" emotion and not sex is the story here.  Viewers might quibble with the saccharin closing scene, but ""Kitchen Stories"" is, like its two central characters, a quiet gem. The denizens of Lake Wobegon would be pleased.",1107388800,24,2480,5.073891625615763
2169726,4,B00065GVIY,"Folke is an oberserver from Sweden for a scientific experiment documenting the cooking habits of single males in a town in Norway. When he is finally admitted into Isak's home he sits in a tall chair and keeps track of Isak's movements in the kitchen. Folke is forbidden to talk to or interact with his subject. Folke becomes frustrated with his job because Isak preferes to cook in his bedroom instead of his kitchen. Folke has to break the rules to break the ice with Isak. They become fast friends and when Folke is forced to return to Sweden when he is fired from the job, Isak finds he can't live with out Folke.

This was a very funny film underneath the moody and gloomy landscape. The chair and the tear drop trailer are just perfect. Isak's friend is really corky. This is an easy one to watch and one I will always enjoy viewing",1105056000,6,838,4.406451612903226
2169727,5,B00065GVIY,"Not all humor has to be slapstick.  This quiet little Scandinavian film tells a simple story of small-town people doing little things, but if you are open to this type of story, you will be happily entertained.

Folke is an observer for a study that will ultimately be used to design efficient kitchens.  He sits in an odd chair not unlike that of a tennis umpire, taking notes about his observee, the unwilling, cantankerous Isak.  Isak pulls lots of tricks to get Folke's goat, but Folke seems as unflappable as Isak is intractable -- at least until the incident of the egg.

I have never seen anything so incredibly heart warming, hillarious, brave and ingeniously put together as this tale of Norwegian kitchen scientists who study ""subjects"" in their native habitat in the rurals.

Such a great film, and the best I ever saw this year.  SEE IT SEE IT SEE IT!!",1102377600,16,491,4.170212765957447
2169729,5,B00065GVIY,"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooh my, this film had me in knots!

Having lived in Norway at one time in my life, I had a strong desire to see this when it turned up at last year's Cork (Ireland) International Film Festival.  I try not to miss Scandinavian films when they're on, anyway, but the blurb sounded good, and so I went.

Scandinavian humour is known for being quite black, actually, and is sometimes hard to swallow.  There are those who find British humour incomprehensible; they would find Scandinavian humour insurmountable.  That is, until they see this film...  (You know things will be good when you're laughing hysterically within the first five or ten minutes.)

The story begins with a group of Swedish researchers, who are sent to the cold and frozen wilderness of Norway to observe the daily habits of middle-aged Norwegian bachelors. The premise for this visit is that the researchers are attempting to redesign kitchens for the usage of such characters; the observations will facilitate a more user-friendly remodelling.  It isn't too long after the introduction of the 'suits' that the viewer will be rolling on the floor in laughter.  This comes about firstly by the inclusion of a bit of rather humorous history: once upon a not-so-long ago, the Swedes drove on the left, and the Norwegians (as they always had done) drove on the right.  Consequently, the team of Swedish researchers, fresh from their border crossing into Norway, must suddenly avoid a near head-on collision, which leaves them discombobulated.  Viewers familiar with the way the Swedish and the Norwegians are constantly jibing one another will immediately recognise the joke played on a certain group of meatball-lovers!

It only gets better.  Folke, one of the observers who is destined to spend the next several months in a ridiculously high observation chair, is instructed to observe Isak, a grumpy old man and not-so-willing participant.  A battle of the wills... and WITS... soon ensues.  With very little dialogue, the dynamic is set by the actions of each character.  Will Folke be forced to end the observation?  Or will Isak submit?  (And how, incidentally, are the others getting on with their studies?)

You won't believe the outcome.

Incidentally, the audience at the CIFF screening went mad for it!  They were breathless with laughter, and often could hardly see through their tears of mirth.",1101600000,45,2401,5.105128205128205

2169748,5,B00065GVIY,"I first saw this movie around 9 years ago when I rented it on a whim.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I enjoy foreign films and immediately fell in love with this one.  I honestly don't know what it is about this movie for me.  It does have some funny parts, but it also makes me feel a little bit melancholy too.  I still adore it.  In a nutshell, a Swedish company is researching efficiency in kitchens and heads to Norway to study the kitchen habits of Norwegian bachelors.  One researcher's assigned bachelor isn't very happy about the study and refuses to allow the man in his house, let alone in his kitchen.  Add to the mix the bachelor's long-time friend who becomes unhappy about the situation himself.  To me, it's both a funny/sad and touching story.

The actors are perfect in their parts and I especially enjoy the character of the Swedish researcher--Folke Nilsson (portrayed by Tomas Norstrm).  However, I think both he and Joachim Calmeyer as Isak Bjrvik are excellent.  It has a small bit of swearing, for those who are concerned about such things, but it is definitely worth watching more than once.  I was beside myself with joy when I came across it in my local thrift store for only $3.00.  I immediately purchased it and have not regretted the buy.

For individuals who are truely interested in the quiet part of a person when they think they need no one... have their walls up... but then we get to see the walls actually begin to come down and get to see how trust and true friendship actually starts... and grows... with no expectations or demands. True friendship to where one will sacrafice something (the horse) very dear to them... KNOWING they will probably lose it.... if it means they can save the life of their one friend. The bottom line is to me that we are basically all the same at our core. Even if we THINK or believe we don't want anyone in our life... there is a part in all of us that wants atleast one friend ....maybe even needs a friend ...especially when our little spot in this huge world becomes dark with a heartwrenching sadness.

2169767,5,B00065GVIY,"This is an unusual Swedish and Norwegian film which plays a little bit upon the rivalry between Norway and Sweden. It may be described as a Scandinavian situational comedy.  Action takes place in a fairly isolated northern farm and village.  There are cold and freezing winters, with ice and snow, and some liquor (not as much as you would think).  The film displays the drumbeat of life and the sadness of death.

Here's the plot.  It's basically a Swedish research project into kitchen habits for the purpose of designing a better kitchen.  The subjects are Norwegian farmers.

This is a bit humorous, but I didn't understand everything.  You need to understand both Swedish and Norwegian, and have a cultural knowledge base, in order to catch everything.

One can describe it as a look at the hard working farmers of the North.  It shows the relationships between men and their fellow men, and by extension between Norway and Sweden.  Perhaps, it speaks to the need to be friends, rather than antagonistic rivals.

The story's premise is that single men are being watched to see how they use their kitchens: specifically, how they move (where they walk) in them.
But it's really about the relationship that develops between one observer and his host, which is, of course, forbidden.

A sincere story about friendship between two lonely men, this bittersweet film is not for those fond of action or speed in movies. If, however, you have 90 minutes and want to see a glimpse of another culture in another time (mid 20th century), give this one a try.

Yes, there is a tradition of mockery between Swedes and Norwegians, on both sides of the Atlantic, which sometimes slumps into animosity. ""We"" think we're easy to tell apart just by looking, but our languages are close enough so that we can converse ... with a few self-satisfied philological smirks on both sides. This film ""Kitchen Stories"" is acted out in both languages, but I suspect anglophones will be uncertain who is speaking what and when. The language mash-up is part of the fun, but only if you speak either Svenska or Norska. Another part of the fun is the time setting of the film, in the 1950s, not long before the Swedes converted their highways from left-lane driving to right-lane, a decision that was as controversial as conversion of 'krner' to euros, which hasn't happened, or as conversion of miles to kilometers in the USA, which also hasn't happened... yet.

And there's a subtle portrayal in this film of the most painful divergence of interests in 20th C Scandinavian history -- Sweden's neutrality in World War II, while Norway was occupied by the Nazis. That was a sore subject in both countries in the 1950s, the temporal setting of ""Kitchen Stories"". The delicate reticence of the two chief characters, one Swedish and one Norwegian, is another 'part of the fun' for a Scandinavian viewer, guaranteed to evoke an indulgent smile.

A lot of the smiles and laughs of ""Kitchen Stories"" may be comprehensible only to Scandinavian viewers, especially those of us with bachelor-farmer uncles. I have one, a Swede who persists in dairy farming, heavily subsidized through a co-op, near Nykping. The sly satire of 'natural characters' of this film will obviously be funnier for Scandinavians (and their nearest neighbors in Minneapolis) than for Gentiles. But I note that all the previous reviewers have been at least mildly amused, have 'gotten the jokes' despite their cultural specificity. Yes, the film is ""SLOW"" by Hollywood standards. It has to be, for our benefit. You know why you should never tell a Norwegian a joke on Thursday, don't you? Because he'll embarrass himself by laughing in church.

It's a comedy, you betcha. A citified Swede is sent to 'observe' the kitchen activity of an elderly Norwegian farmer, who has volunteered for the research project in hopes of getting a horse to replace his dying 'old friend' in the stable. The gift horse turns out to be a Dalarna statuette of a horse, the ultimate Swedish folk-art knick-knack. Meanwhile, the farmer regrets his gesture. He hates to be 'observed' and studied. There's a broad rebuke buried in this humor, addressed to anthropologists and sociologists everywhere. Observation IS an indignity, and besides, just as in quantum physics, the presence of the observer always renders the observed uncertain.

The farmer and the efficiency expert eventually must communicate, despite the protocol of the research that forbids human interaction. That's the story. It's a poignant ""love story"" in the end, though not with any sensationalist homoerotic implications. It's pure ""agap"" rather than ""eros"". It's a tale of loneliness and friendship, and it's eventually quite touching, even if you don't get all the jokes. In fact, for me the ending became a tad too sentimental.

One might compare this film to ""Waking Ned Devine"", also a story of two old geezers bonding in friendship. ""Waking Ned Devine"" is knee-slapping funny for any audience. ""Kitchen Stories"" is modest and intimate, with a cast of just four male principals and a couple of extras. But those actors are brilliantly convincing in their roles. Everything about this modest satirical/sentimental film is well done.",1285027200,8,3902,5.079563182527301
2169772,5,B00065GVIY,"Nothing beats the thrill of sitting down to a surprising and original movie. Add to that much laughter and warm characters...and a beautiful setting, and you have ""Kitchen Stories.""

I don't know who thought up this story, but I'll tip my cap to those who did. And before I let go of its bill let me tip it, again, to the director and actors who sold that story to us so quietly and earnestly that it felt as though we peered in at them from the ladder outside the window, or overheard them through the drill hole, or witnessed their conversation from the tall chair.

2169774,4,B00065GVIY,"I've been really surprised in reading the 26 previous reviews that almost nothing has been said about what seemed to me the central theme in this movie - the repression of male love, which in the end triumphs.  You can call it ""male bonding"" if you want (as one reviewer did), but frankly, ""male bonding"" doesn't involved jealousy to the point of attempted murder, a rather large and dramatic incident in the film which nobody who wrote reviews seems to have noticed.  At the end of plot, intense jealousy is replaced by the mutual love which the two survivors had for the third - and apparently now for each other- and which is no doubt encouraged by the lack of options for them, a fact which gay men who have grown up in rural areas before the internet will instantly recognize.  I would not hesitate to call this a ""gay genre film"" - it's all over the plot and the emotional development of the characters.  If you ignore it, you're missing a major part of the film.  The lack of overt sexual content simply points to the fact that while being ""observed"" by an (initially) unknown outsider, the two farmers in the kitchen are restrained from acting naturally - as one sees when their customary meeting for coffee one morning lasts all of a minute and is abruptly terminated by the presence of the ""scientific observer"" (Folke).  Of course, as with any real piece of art, this film has many other aspects  - the general repression of one's humanity by a narrowly scientific approach to life, the issues surrounding the tension between Norwegians and Swedes, etc. It also has a certain deadpan humor, although I can't imagine why people would be rolling in the aisles.  But in the end, it's essentially a movie about men who fall in love, even if the circumstances don't allow sex on screen.  Perhaps the message was a little too subtle for some.  It's a good film.

2169776,3,B00065GVIY,"This semi-wonderful Scandinavian film can be sifted into two piles -- one funny and one poignant. Of the two, the first is far more watchable.

""Kitchen Stories"" relates attempts by HFI, a Swedish efficiency firm, to map the movements of single Norwegian males in the kitchen. The corporate experts, gray-clad and dull, pile into tiny trailers and head off into the frigid wastes of rural Norway. Once there, they are to into high, tennis-referee-style chairs in a kitchen corner and record their subjects as they move about. The first half of the film had an extremely dry, comic absurdist tone. In a human version of the Heisenberg Principle, the watcher cannot help but change the object he is watching. Mousy Folke Nilsson must endure being ignored and literally left in the dark by a crusty old Norwegian farmer named Isak. Slowly, inevitably, and against the rules, a bond begin to form between the two. A scene in which Folke borrows and then misplaces a saltshaker is a classic of subtle comedy.

Disappointingly, the film's second loses the subtle comedy of the first half and becomes almost maudlin. It's not difficult to imagine how the latter half's themes of loss, death and friendship could have been retained while also retaining the funny.

For those attuned to such things, there is a fair amount of good-humored Swedish-Norwegian joshing -- even to the point of a risky broaching of Swedish neutrality during the war. In a classic piece of visual humor, a border crossing is set up so that right-hand Swedish drivers can switch efficiently to the left-handed Norwegian style. But in spite of its wonderful premise and talented acting, overall, the film was a disappointment.",1250035200,2,1692,4.971731448763251
2169777,4,B00065GVIY,"As expected, Norwegians and Swedes do treat each other with some mistrust, like any two people living side by side. :) Apparently, the universal human values can overcome this mistrust (pardon the obvious cliche), which is what ""Kitchen Stories"" is largely about. Alas, I couldn't tell what language the Norwegians and the Swedes spoke to each other in the film - I wonder who dominates: in the case of French- and German-speaking Swiss the default common medium is French.

Quiet and reserved in a nordic way, this film is a little gem based on an absurd premise. The interpretation of ""Flickorna i Saland"" sang phonetically by the Delta Rhythm Boys is simply wonderful.",1248307200,,671,4.938053097345133

Honestly; it is one of my all time favorite moves! It is such a heartfelt, funny, easy going movie with a soft, caring touch. It stayed with me the following week.

If you're not familiar with the 1950s or do not know anything about Norway or Sweden you might not get all the funny little moments or lines. When that is said this is a movie that I believe everyone can relate to and you will be drawn into the emotions the characters are feeling.

The movie is about the interaction between a Swedish and a Norwegian man. The Swedish man comes to the Norwegian farmer to observe the Norwegian kitchen life. He cannot talk or interact with his subject. The Norwegian farmer is not too keen about being observed. And a small ""war"" evolves between the two men. And then there's the incident with the egg (that everyone is talking about). Without spoiling too much; let's just say the egg incident changes things.

An absurd, funny, heart felt movie you have to see at least once! A picture, a look, an understanding can tell more than a thousand words! The film will touch you in one way or another :)

Isak, as the subject of Folke's sociological research, offered himself up to be studied thinking a horse was to be provided, and when a toy horse arrived instead of a breathing one, on strike he went. Thus began their banal arrangement.

Things delved into a quiet silence, each respecting the other's space in the midst of themselves. Each watched the other. One took notes, the other remembered. Soon, they realized how similar they were: two single men doing little more than avoiding relationships, living alone.

Isak is a curmudgeoned older bachelor living in Norway, whilst Folke, also a bachelor, makes a living studying people like Isak. However, having never dialogued with his subjects, Folke, he never saw more them as more than moving objects to be charted and analyzed. Within a few cups of coffee, two lonely men become brothers, seeing there is something more important than a self-induced hermitage.

Their relationship develops with subtle sophistication, with Folke bringing in rare treats his elderly aunt sends him, and Isak, saving his friend from being run over by a train.

Set in 1950, as Swedish ""home scientists"" invade the homes of Norwegian bachelors to study the use of their kitchens, the film describes the limits of scientific inquiry. Perched in what can only be called an adult-size highchair, the home scientist assigned to one bachelor attempts to unobtrusively observe his every movement. Unlike a lab rat, however, the bachelor modifies his behavior to accommodate this intrusion, and before too long the two men are making tentative attempts to alleviate the boredom of it all. A friendship forms that so totally compromises the study that they sometimes switch places as observer and observed. Finally, it is a story about a kind of male bonding, especially as a friend of the bachelor finds himself neglected and takes desperate measures to get rid of the man who has supplanted him.

2169785,5,B00065GVIY,"But this deserves it. Nearly perfect in all ways.

No need to reiterate the plot, which is very slight and well rehashed by the others. I do think there is another subtle issue going on which isn't much addressed here. The early 50s, when this movie is set, were a time of science as the end-all and be-all, the solver of all human problems and repairer of all human brokenness. Remember electricity too cheap to meter? Behaviorism? On and on the litany went, how reason and science would fix the damage done by evil and superstition.

Kitchen Stories is about the relationship between science and the heart. The famous dictum that we must murder to dissect, and by murdering our subject it is not longer fit for study, is beautifully examined here. A scientist, the dispassionate and cold observer, watches a man, and as his fondness grows, his observations diminish and then fail completely. What began as observer and observee becomes two friends. Science cannot know the human heart, just the human paths. And the way people walk around a room tells us very little about them.

Delightful touches abound, as sly jokes, clever dialog, those brilliant chairs (oh, how God-like the scientist is on his perch!) and the rawest of emotions surface in this quiet world. Even the leaders of the team, the firmest believers in what science can teach, demonstrate their own human failings and flaws. Nope, science is of limited use when looking at humans, or pigeons for that matter.
