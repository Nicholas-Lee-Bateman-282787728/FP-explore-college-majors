7796069,4,1560154020,"This tape is awesome.  I wish you had more German/English translation that are timely and useful.  The children nursery rhymes are fun and easy to learn.  They talk about things like the days of the week, types of food, desert and family members to make the language easy to learn.

4 Stars because its an old fashioned tape and not a CD.",1372204800,,338,4.403225806451613
7796070,5,1560154020,"My daughter is 15 months old and really enjoys this tape.  Not as much as Bilingual Baby - German, but a close second. I like the first video (Lyric Language - German) in this series a little better, but both are very good. The songs are catchy, without being too obnoxious, so I don't mind seeing the video over and over again.",1013472000,10,328,4.290322580645161
