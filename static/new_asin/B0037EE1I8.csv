8390483,5,B0037EE1I8,I am a devout Mormon. I have often wondered why the early members of my faith were hated so much. Simply watching this silent film explained a lot. It seems there where films like this for a while. I must admit Noah Berry was a real villon. Mae did not have to talk. Her eyes tell the story.,1434326400,2,291,4.0344827586206895
8390484,4,B0037EE1I8,"This early silent film from 1917 gives us a rare and most interesting glimpse into our society and mentality of a century or so ago, when the general public's perception of the Mormons was extremely negative and even tinged with fear.  This in itself makes ""A Mormon Maid"" worth viewing, simply for its historical value through which we can gain a better understanding of human society and our not-so-distant past.  While no doubt offensive to many modern-day viewers, ""A Mormon Maid"" seems to compensate for its political incorrectness with an exciting, action-packed adventure drama, headed by prominent stars of early cinema, produced by Jesse L Lasky who later co-founded Paramount Pictures, and made under the supervision of Cecil B DeMille himself; his name appearing among the credits of many silent films as the 'Director General'.

The `maid' in question is played by Mae Murray, a popular actress of the silent era and known as ""the girl with the bee stung lips"" due to her pouted lips, and together with beautiful big eyes and wild hair, she is perfect in the role of a young woman, at first very girlish, but forced to mature quickly when confronted with force and coercion by the Mormons.  Her love interest is played by Frank Borzage, who had already played a hundred small roles in silent films by this time, and who continued his career behind the camera, as a director and producer, not long after appearing in A Mormon Maid.  The third outstanding character is Noah Beery (Sr), wearing heavy make-up to appear especially sinister as the Mormon leader, Burr, who forces the pretty young Dora (Mae Murray) and her reluctant father into Mormon marriages.

Action and adventure scenes involving Indians and the Mormon pioneers heading out West are very well done, and the imprint of both Lasky and DeMille are evident in the overall high standard of photography, screenplay and drama - the latter strongly inclined towards pantomime, as was common in early, pre-1920 silent films.  The quality of the picture is very good indeed, and the accompanying piano score by Stuart Oderman stands out as being above average.  The story itself is also very good, as well as unpredictable and surprising, if not even shocking at times.  After a family is rescued from an Indian attack by the Mormons, they become obliged to accept their faith after living and prospering in their community, but when the husband/father is told to accept a second wife, things become decidedly nasty.  Prominent in this film are the 'Avenging Angels' - dressed in the same garb as the Ku Klux Clan - who played a role in the obscure past, connected with the early history of the Mormon Church, but who were obviously considered to be a main and even frightening aspect of the Mormons when this film was made.  Further surprising evidence of the general public's views of the Mormons in the early 1900s can be seen in a 1922 film entitled ""Trapped by the Mormons"", available on the Grapevine Video label.  Whether for historic interest or simply good entertainment, A Mormon Maid fits the bill and manages to stand up very well after almost a century.",1268006400,11,3135,4.87218045112782
