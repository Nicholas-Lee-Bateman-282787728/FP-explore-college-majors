8405006,5,B003T78HMY,"This is far from strictly laughs.  It is a serious story of loneliness and despair in the Italian community of the North end of Boston.  Filmed in 2006, there is snow on the ground and no cellphones in the main characters' hands.  Our big hero is veteran actor Danny Aiello, a Jewish-Italian actor from New York, playing a driver for s funeral home at age 74.  He is alienated from his ex-wife,who has called the cops on him one Christmas when he got violent.  They meet but they fight.  Their one son is in his early 20's, angry at his father for abandoning him.  Money is tight.  He is behind in his rent. Life isn't good except when there is a funeral.

Then there's a nice drive to the countryside and plenty of good food and drinks.  The funeral parlor is a social club for the old Italians. But the shortage of corpses leads the actors into finding solutions to getting more bodies.

The film started out somewhat light and full of funny jabs amongst the three whackis who work together there.  But it becomes clear that these are lost and unhappy men.  Their loneliness and neediness is painful to watch.  It is supposed to be funny but it seems more like total pathos.

Danny Aiello dresses well and has an eye for the ladies.  He picks up a woman less than half his age who claims she is a widow still in mourning.  Naturally we get to see them going at it that night.  She is duped into thinking him richer and more powerful than he is.  Looking for s sugar daddy she explodes when she finds out she's been fooled.  Everyone is on the take. Very sad.

Then!!! The film rapidly gets violent with body bags and blood and dark streets and blunt instruments and revenge.  Alarmingly angry and depressing developments for a comedy!

However I did have to laugh when the young Nino, endlessly wondering where his father went, discovers him in cementa shoes a.  Yes he finds him at the bottom of the bay when he hmisled drowns there by accident.

Others seemed to think it was funny.  I found it alarming.  Could it have been my own state of mind?  Why is the main actor so old?",1431216000,,2081,4.37696335078534

8405008,3,B003T78HMY,It wasn't what I expected. Wish it had a better plot. Don't recommend it. Danny Aiello has done better stuff.,1399507200,,109,4.5
8405009,5,B003T78HMY,"I saw the premiere of this movie at the Montreal Film Festival a while back and I remembered falling in love then with the caracters. It's well written, shot like a 70's mob movie. Nice! And Danny Aiello is formidable.",1380844800,,218,4.475
8405010,1,B003T78HMY,Usually 15 mins into the movie I know whether or not I'm going to like it.  I didn't like this movie.  It might have got funnier as it went on but I just couldn't wait that long.  Danny Aiello is one of my favorite actors but this movie doesn't do him justice.,1324166400,,260,3.9615384615384617
8405011,5,B003T78HMY,"Some might say a VERY dark comedy in parts, but thoroughly enjoyable! Danny Aiello always turns in a nice performance and ""Stiffs"" is no exception. Jon Polito has that unmistakable voice that this film really couldn't do without and the rest of the cast also makes for a great one and one-half hours of entertainment.

Goes from light to a rather dark comedy with a surprise ending; I certainly never found a slow moment!",1281916800,,421,4.6891891891891895
8405012,4,B003T78HMY,"A funeral parlor run by the mob? That alone is really pretty hilarious. Inventory challenged? Create some?! And three `wise-guys' running the whole show? A recipe for ruinous fun; my wife and I both enjoyed it.  Danny Aiello is fun to watch here as one of the `wise guys,' a hearse driver trying to `make a living.'  Jon Polito, Frank Vincent and Lesley Ann Warren (so memorable in `Victor Victoria') are also great in their respective roles; some unexpected plot twists and dark but clever humor, what more could you ask for?",1279238400,2,526,4.706521739130435
