2467583,3,B000CNTHYU,"Enjoyable Mummy-genre film. Sophie Marceau is the only reason to watch this really. The story is weak, but thought out. The effects aren't as good as some other films. Overall it was an enjoyable film. Recommended if you are a fan of Mummy movies like me.",1425945600,,255,4.565217391304348

2467587,4,B000CNTHYU,"THe one and only review on amazon had only 1 start. So I went to another site of movie rental where they had much more reviews of that movie. They were much more positive with an average between 3 and 4. So we watched it, and I don't understand the very low review on amazon. It is not a perfect movie, it would not win Cannes or an Oscar, but it is a good entertaining movie. Good story; good actors; funny or scary at times; original location.",1375574400,4,445,4.126436781609195

Synopsis: An Egyptian sarcopacus is found hidden away in the back of a large storage room at the Louvre. As the resident experts begin their examination of the remains within strange events begin to plague the museum and the surrounding neighborhood. Frequent electrical shortages soon escalate into more serious occurances such as the disappearance of ancient Egyptain artifacts and the deaths of several museum employees while stories of a Phantom stalking the premises at night abound.

Meanwhile across the street from the legendary landmark a beautiful young woman named Lisa (Sophie Marceau) begins to hear strange voices and hallucinate. Are the two events connected and if so what does any of this have to do with the unidentified corpse within the sacophacus?

Critique: Released in '01 'Belphegor' is a moderately entertaining film offering surprisingly quirky and original dialogue, above average special effects and some nice atmospheric sequences of the mysterious Phantom cloaked in black gliding around the musuem. Add to the mix the charming Sophie Marceau who is always a plus to any film and you have the makings of a pretty enjoyable evening. On the negative side, the movie is a little overlong and there are some uneven spots that make it difficult to maintain your undivided interest.

My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",1188777600,,1382,5.239819004524887
8099842,5,B000CNTHYU,This is an amazing film.  I especially enjoyed the Louvre and the Parisian scenery.  Having visited Paris I recognized a number of the sites.  Sophie Marceau is cute and adorable - and a very talented actress.  Famed actress Julie Christie has a supporting role.  I'm baffled by the low reviews.,1469318400,,295,4.82

8099849,5,B000CNTHYU,"I found this to be a very enjoyable film, superior to many of the Amazon Prime free videos out there.  In my humble opinion, worth renting if you don't have Prime.  A particular pleasure was that I could empathize with the characters, something that is rather rare for me when it comes to most ""modern"" films.  If you enjoy old school Universal-style horror movies, I think you will like this.",1444780800,,393,4.585714285714285

8099851,3,B000CNTHYU,"The continuity of the story was a bit flawed. The exposition is not quite completed for the main character, Belphegor. The special effect is a bit contrived in the effort to become memorable.
A formulaic movie but the visuals are interesting. Not the worst and not the best. Nice movie for a slow evening.",1428537600,,305,4.666666666666667
