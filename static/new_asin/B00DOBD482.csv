5838211,5,B00DOBD482,"And a good movie on its own, too. I loved the set-up,the flow of the story was good and there were a few surprises. I was with him all the way on his journey as he fell into a good though dubious oppertunity. The sub-plots were good as well. I didn't know what would come next and liked the unexpected ending. As a movie, I give it four stars, but as a Statham movie I give it a big five stars. Saw it last night and still thinking about it.",1372377600,72,441,3.911111111111111
5838212,5,B00DOBD482,"So... you're reading this review thinking, ""Straight to video... that can't be good.""

But... I mean, really? What do you want? Statham! The beginning of ""Redemption"" finds Statham, some sort of former Special Ops guy, down on his luck and living on skid row somewhere in London. This once proud man has fallen a long way. He's on the run. Statham wants to be a good man but he ends up doing morally questionable things... a bunch of guys get punched... yadda yadda yadda...

It's all pretty solid -- plenty of violence, engaging performances from the cast, a nun who looks super hot when she takes her glasses off...  That is to say, ""Redemption"" is exactly the movie you'd expect it to be. In a good way.",1372377600,5,706,4.543307086614173

5838231,5,B00DOBD482,"Redemption is an interesting movie, much different than any movie Jason Statham has ever done. If you thought it would have been more car choices, shootouts with guns or fighting, youll have been disappointed. There is still plenty of action and fighting, but its not the typical Statham movie. There are probably only a few actors who could pull it off and Statham succeeded. His character has a military past that just won't let him go. He has nightmares over it and when he returned home, he hit the streets and drinking makes him forget.

Stathams characters name is Joey and one day he sobers up, gets a job and ends up working for the Chinese underworld as a driver/enforcer and the money starts rolling in. His heart is in the right place when it comes to the money as he helps out a nun who runs a pseudo soup kitchen for the homeless. We learn Joey has a wife and daughter but for whatever reason Joey hasn't seen them since he came back from Afghanistan. A homeless friend of his was killed and hes on a quest to avenger her death. We learn that Joey is really human and Statham has to resort to some serous acting to make the movie work, and not just kicking, fighting, shooting or driving fast and hard.

Although he helped many people in the end we see him going back to the bottle. In his words, when he is sober he tends to do bad things to people and when he drinks it makes him forget. Its a sad movie but Statham pulled it off. Hopefully he does a few more of these kinds of moving as it makes him a more serious actor.",1504396800,,1537,4.278350515463917

5838233,1,B00DOBD482,"Do not, even for a moment, believe that this is an ""action thriller"" or an ""action"" anything else. It is a snooze, a slog, and an incomprehensible bore. There is no real through line that you could even call a story. And sweet mother of mercy, could NO ONE manage to make the dialogue comprehensible in post-production? I'd be amazed if I could understand 20% of what was being said, even with the sound cranked to painful levels.

There is one fight scene in the entire film, and it's entirely uninteresting: Statham punching a few unruly soccer fans. That's it. The film contains no suspense, no thrills, no action, no discernible plot, no believable characters, and is an amazing waste of time and talent. The photography, however, is adequate. Which is a shame, as it kept me hoping that this film would eventually turn into something. It didn't. Avoid like the plague!",1502496000,,873,4.743421052631579

5838306,2,B00DOBD482,"I bought this DVD based upon (1) being a fan of Jason Statham and (2) the several positive reviews.  While I'm still a fan of his, I respectfully disagree with the positive reviews other than the fact that he does show a broader range of acting skills than in most of his films.  I found the film glacially slow and just not very entertaining. I found myself fast-forwarding several times.  Part of the problem was in the direction...reminded me of a typical European film with long, lingering and boring shots. There were two or three requisite fight scenes, and while well-done, they were not as exciting as fight scenes in other Statham films.

This, along with the almost as boring 'Wild Card', just aren't up to the level of fun and enjoyment of most of his other films, IMO.  Hopefully, he will land a role in a better film that will make use of his expanding acting abilities.",1453075200,,883,4.563291139240507

5838386,4,B00DOBD482,"All I wanted was a movie that I could have on in the background after I got off work this evening.  The ""action"" section included this film, which appeared to be a direct-to-video formula film: Statham as an ex-Special Forces soldier fighting against the criminal underground on the streets of London?  Sold!  With a tagline like that, I expected something thoroughly mindless, with some action scenes I could peek at once in awhile.  Instead, this turned out to be a nuanced film, with a terrific performance from Statham, playing a conflicted antihero.  I try to avoid a detailed synopsis of the film in these reviews, but there may be some mild spoilers in this discussion.

It was directed and written by Steven Knight, who was also responsible for Eastern Promises, which is another film that's ostensibly an action movie, but hides a deeper intelligence.  Knight uses flashbacks and an occasional fantasy sequence to illustrate Statham's mindset, and how he's fallen so far.  At the start of the movie, Statham's playing entirely against type, showing a vulnerability that is missing from a lot of his roles.  The bad news is that Statham has to carry most of the emotional heft without much help.  I thought that Agata Buzek (the female protagonist) did a fairly good job with a really difficult role, but the rest of the supporting cast was mostly nondescript.

The film does revert to a more traditional action script in the second half, and the fight scenes are brutal.  The pacing doesn't move like a normal action movie, though.  We have time to breathe and reflect.  Statham isn't guided by an unerring moral compass, either.  Sometimes you root for him, sometimes you wonder if the guy can ever truly be redeemed.  Speaking of which:  one thing I really like about the film is how its meaning seems to change in every act.  In fact, I would have flip-flopped on the very reason behind the movie's title.  I appreciate that Knight really takes the time to establish Statham's background.  Often, antiheroes engage in a bit of Robin Hood-style behavior, and it falls completely flat.  Here, we at least understand Statham's motivation.

The bottom line is that this film is a worthy follow-up to Eastern Promises, and it has my favorite Jason Statham performance to date.  It's definitely worth giving a try.",1422230400,,2320,4.877237851662404

5838394,4,B00DOBD482,"The movie Redemption really requires consideration of Jason Stathams film career.

Statham seemingly came out of nowhere to become a sophisticated-looking action hero with the Transporter movie series (and though many did not care much for the sequels, I thought all three were good).  He was in films before that, appearing in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels back in 1998 and Transporter didn't come out until 2002, but that was the first film I saw him in.  He currently has about 39 films to his credit, virtually all of them being action films in which he often makes use of his martial art skills.  Like Jackie Chan, normally he does all of the stunt work and fight scenes himself.  Wikipedia describes him as having studied Wing Chun kung fu, karate and kickboxing.  I am no martial arts expert but to me his style seems much influenced by savate, as he is particularly good with his feet.  That, and the look of Transporter had me thinking that he is French, but actually he is British, and Redemption one might say brings him back home, because it is set in London.

Redemption actually has 3 different titles, depending on the region of release: it is also called Hummingbird [I am assuming in Great Britain] and Crazy Joe in France.

Stathams prototypical look involves a short, stubbly beard and moustache [like a week without a shave], and a significantly balding head.  He usually plays a morally ambiguous character, and when hes doing down and out his hair may be long and dirty.  In other scenes he will appear in very well-tailored suits which, with the stubbly beard and moustache creates a quite distinctive look.  Compared to the average male action-hero [think Schwarzenegger, Stallone, etc] who were often faulted early on for their lack of emotional expression, their wooden delivery of lines etc, Statham from the start seemed to have more acting talent, as well as genuine martial arts capability.

Then, after Transporter 2 his film career seemed to nose dive disappointingly.  Prototypical examples would be Crank, ""Crank II- High Voltage"", and the Expendables series (the first was not bad but II and III got progressively worse).  Jason, say it aint soyou aren't going to go the way of Steven Seagal are you?

Thankfully I can say that Redemption is the best film starring Statham that Ive seen since the first Transporter [admittedly, I haven't seen all of his films].  In fact, considering the overall thoughtfulness of this material, its the best movie Ive ever seen him in.
Its not possible to say much about the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't watched it, but at the beginning of the film its obvious that his character had been a British military operative, apparently in Afghanistan along with the other coalition forces.  After a patrol goes very badly he ends up going AWOL, and at the start of the movie hes a homeless street person in London, drinking heavily and obviously suffering PTSD symptoms.  He regularly visits a free-dinner line with other unfortunates, at which Sister Cristina, a Catholic nun, serves the meals [played by Agata Buzek, whom I don't think Ive seen before].

Both he and the sister are struggling, in quite different ways, to overcome past traumas.  During the course of the movie they each reveal more of their past to each other, as well as their current struggles to overcome it.

Although this is about 17 years since his movie debut, Statham still can perform quite competently in fight scenes.  There are several in the movie and they are well-done, but not unnecessarily gory.  And though this is at least one-half action movie, there is no chase scene which is usually de rigeur for an action film.  The other half is about their internal struggles and their gradually unfolding relationship.  As for other R type material, there is some swearing, but a lot less than in the usual R-rated action film, and there's no female nudity (there are some black and white photographs depicting male nudity).

I give this film a B+, and am hoping it marks a redemption of Stathams acting career.  I hope he does many more serious films, like this one.",1421020800,8,4134,4.825531914893617

But it caught enough of my attention that I watched it again a week or so later and I really enjoyed it. This is NOT your typical Jason Statham shoot-em-up action flick. This movie is a drama about a man who finally comes to terms with the mistakes he's made and sets out to make amends for them in his own way. Jason Statham probably won't be winning an Oscar for his acting roles anytime soon, but he is perfectly cast in this and give a great dramatic turn as a change of pace from his usual stuff (which I also happen to like). Besides Benedict Wong (Prometheus"") and, in a small role, Danny Webb (Morse from ""Alien""), the rest of the cast is made up of virtually unknowns, but that in no way detracts from the quality of the film.

Technical info: As per blu-ray.com and my own observations this movie was shot digitally and everything looks fantastic. The dark night-time scenes are clear, with excellent definition and contrast. Daytime scenes are equally impressive. The main audio track is the de-facto standard DTS Master Audio in 5.1-channel surround sound. Very often when watching movies I find myself constantly adjusting the volume up and down between dialogue-heavy scenes and ""action"" scenes. This is not the case with this film. The audio mix is absolutely perfect. Spoken dialogue being very easily understood without having to increase the volume.

Lionsgate was once known for lower-budget - and in some cases, near-B-grade - films but they have steadily earned their reputation as a true player among the bigger Hollywood studios. While not perfect, ""Redemption"" is still a great film that I will not hesitate to watch again.

5838426,3,B00DOBD482,"In one of his more recent films, Jason Statham tries out a more dramatic role. While his performance was terrific, this slow moving film leaves a lot to be desired. Joey (Jason Statham) is a war veteran who has returned to a London that is no longer his home. Falling on hard times, Joey is one of a group of homeless drug addicts, that are being terrorized by a group of thugs. While fleeing from another beating, Joey finds a seemingly abandoned, upscale apartment, and sees it as a chance to get back on his feet. The story was interesting, but it moves at a snails pace and is somewhat unbelievable. Statham pretends to be friends with the man who owns the apartment and the neighbors never question it. The film is further harmed by Joey's love interest, who just happens to be a nun. It was a very strange dynamic. Jason Statham was terrific, as a guy who was leading two lives. At one point he's this addict, trying to protect his girlfriend and at another, he's a mob enforcer, doing what he must to find and save her. The character of the nun, while performed admirably by newcomer Agata Buzek, really complicates the story. It was a semi-interesting twist, but it really takes the movie off course for extended periods of time, slowing the film to a halt. I'm a big Jason Statham fan and will watch anything he does, but if I were making recommendations on which of his film to watch, Redemption sadly wouldn't make the cut.",1408233600,,1434,4.498084291187739

5838434,4,B00DOBD482,"This is not your typical Jason Statham movie.  It has almost none of the martial arts sequences that you might find in The Transporter movies. The ratio of action to acting is roughly 15 minutes out of one and a half hours. So, give it a miss if you are expecting to watch a formulaic action-adventure flick.

What you get is a really excellent - if somewhat complicated and unrealistic - melodrama with some good acting about characters that we come to care about.  Statham is an AWOL soldier suffering from PTSD after committing a war crime in Iraq.  He's living on the street with a girl. He's kicked out of his doldrum when he and the girl get shaken down. In escaping from these thugs, he breaks into an apartment of a gay photographer who is out of London for an extended period. Statham takes over the apartment and starts to recover himself.  He gets a job at a Chinese restaurant, where an incidental display of martial arts prowess impresses the boss and earns Statham a job as a collector for his rackets. At the same time, Statham starts to contribute to a soup kitchen run by a beautiful young nun, which earns him a romantic connection with all of the ""will they or won't they"" tension - and we don't get a definite answer on that question.

Statham's character wants to be a ""good man"" but he's working for thugs and distributing drugs.  He finds out that the girl he started the movie with has been killed and the police do not care. This, then, sets up the resolution of the movie as the question of what does it mean to become redeemed, i.e., does taking out one bad guy make you a good guy?  (Like Statham's character, I think not.)

Despite its obvious religious theme, and the fact that the main character is a Catholic nun, and the fact that Statham's character is Catholic, I didn't find anything particularly thoughtful or Christian about the theme of redemption and salvation.  That may be a good point if you are the type who gets offended by ""preachy"" movies, or it may be a weak point if you are looking for thoughtful explorations of transcendental subjects.  I fall in the latter category, but I still found the story and the acting to be worth watching.",1406937600,,2184,4.50379746835443

He plays what could be called the one-of-a-kind personality when it comes to characters, but this movie is jaw-dropping. there's action, romance, comedy, explosions, and a back story that is explained as the movie goes and not all told beginning or end. Maybe you already know what happens from other reviews, but ill leave it at this; if you know Jason Statham's character, your going to love this. If you don't know him or care about his roles, you're still going to love this. I am more of a horror fan than action, but when it comes to Jason, it's a wild ride.

5838445,3,B00DOBD482,"Redemption (also known as Hummingbird) stars Jason Statham as a former Special Forces coming back from Afghanistan, but those who are expecting something like the Transporter series would be disappointed with the crime drama set in todays underground London. The brooding film is more like a character study, following the story of Joseph Smith (Statham), a veteran who goes AWOL, currently living in London as a homeless.

Joseph is given a chance to start over his life, when he enters an apartment room of someone who is now away from home. He then starts working for Mr. Choy (Benedict Wong), a crime lord who is involved in human trafficking. In the meanwhile, he attempts to use his newly gained power to do the right things. The film also follows the relationship between Joseph and a nun Cristina (Agata Buzek), which is the most unique aspect of the film.

So, in Redemption Jason Statham shows what he can do as an actor. Though personally I prefer to watch another Transporter sequel, I think he did a decent job. But, while Redemption benefits from Chris Menges moody photography, the film itself lacks rhythm, suffering from the flat narrative.

Probably Redemption will be remembered as Steven Knights debut work as director. Knight has been known for his screenplays for Dirty Pretty Things and Eastern Promises. In a sense Redemption may be called the third film of his London underworld trilogy and is the least effective one.",1404172800,,1443,4.9300411522633745

5838449,2,B00DOBD482,"Jason Statham movies are basically their own genre, and I'm fairly certain I've seen them all.

There is a basic formula, so far as I can tell.  Jason's character starts the movie as a normal, every day man, with a secret, butt kicking past that he'd prefer to stay in his past.  At some point in the movie, someone he cares about is disrespected, abducted, assaulted, or killed.  At that point, Jason's character activates his inner bad ass and begins to systematically beat and/or kill any number of bad guys, with his superior fighting skills, with or without a shirt on.  There is also usually a very attractive love interest that he must protect, save, or otherwise impress.  The formula works for me and my wife.  I get to see merciless beatings, and a pretty female, my wife gets to see the chiseled Brit kicking butt and cracking wise.  There is no expectation of profoundness whatsoever, and that is just fine!

With this mindset in place, somehow Redemption's plot seemed thin and cheesy.  Jason stays dark and gloomy throughout, and despite basically morphing into the Transporter character halfway through the movie, never delivers on the snarky asskickery we've all come to love and expect.  Oh, there's fighting, but most of it was overly gruesome and disturbing, mostly leaving you feeling sorry for the recipient, instead of feeling like the guy is getting just what he deserved.

The love interest was just not very interesting.  I ascribe that to the character, and not the actress herself, but nevertheless, there was no real chemistry between them.  I found myself thinking about the annoying love interest in the 3rd Transporter movie.

Finally, the final confrontation with the bad guy was about as anticlimactic as you could get, given this was an action movie.

I am working from home today and will no doubt be watching the driveway for an Audi containing an angry Jason Statham as soon as I click Submit on this review.",1401667200,3,1945,4.830815709969788

A number of very difficult topics are handled in this movie and the interplay is intriguing.  The complexity of these issues are presented in a rather cursory manner.  Not that any film could truly capture the difficulties of homelessness, PTSD, substance abuse, or the challenges that the world presents to any given religion.  However, the presentation and interaction were well done, particularly for an action movie.  The primary characters have significant flaws but the viewer is compelled to root for them because of their positive personal characteristics.  The implications for judgment are left to the viewer.  I can see a variety of potential interpretations depending on perspective.  Though a totally different approach to film making it reminded me in a way of Forrest Gump.  The fight scenes are well choreographed but are limited in terms of the normal action fair.  Statham fans may be disappointed in this regard.  The ending is not a triumphant ride into the sunset.

We meet his homeless girlfriend, Isabel (not really sure she's his girlfriend, though, because we know nothing about her), who has about three lines of dialogue before she disappears from the film. SPOILER ALERT! Later, she turns up dead, and Smith (now ""Jones"" - ha ha, get it?) spends the rest of the film trying to find her killer. Again, why? Along the way, he goes to work for an Asian gangster and commits reprehensible acts against innocent people -- including seducing a nun -- all to get to Isabel's killer.

Along the way, Smith's daughter and baby-mama show up for about five minutes. Apparently, Smith's attachment to this mysterious Isabel are far stronger than his connection to his own daughter and her mother, because they're in and out of the film in two scenes.

5838472,4,B00DOBD482,"Also known as Hummingbird this movie, in a nutshell, describes the travails of a homeless ex-veteran (Statham) scarred by his experience in combat in the Middle East and who is on the run from a court martial. He is living rough in London, sharing a cardboard box with a friend named Isabel. One evening a couple of small time thugs decide to beat up the homeless including Statham who takes the brunt of things allowing Isabel to run away. During the fight Statham also hot foots away and find himself in an apartment, the wealthy owner of whom has gone to the United States for some months. With a home base and funds Statham decides enough is enough and turns his life around, cleans himself up a bit and gets work in a Chinese restaurant. Pretty soon his martial skills see him seconded to a less savoury Chinese family business and this in turns gives him access to plenty of cash which he then uses to assist a nun who runs a soup kitchen for homeless people and his ex-wife and daughter. He also pursues what happened to his friend Isabel.

As the movie goes along we see Stathams character oscillate between the likeable fellow he probably was prior to his wartime experiences and the engine of destruction he is capable of being. At the end of the film a range of sub-plots will coalesce into a final resolution. In the final analysis this isn't a bad Statham vehicle at all, it is nicely filmed and tightly written with an oft-times minimalist plot and gritty action scenes. The whole thing feels very 'close' in terms of the sets and the hues used. There are some delicately handled emotional points such as the way non-custodial parents wonder how their children will view them as well as hints towards the way in which even those who appear to have their acts together can oft-times be damaged internally.

On the one hand I was disappointed because this is not one of his stock-in-trade, tough guy action movies - which was what I was in the mood to watch.  On the other hand, it was nice to see him in a more dramatic role (a level similar to ""Blitz"").  His performance at the very end of the film is well executed & very touching.  The plot is straightforward & all right, & some of the photography & imagery are evocative.  The extent of the fight scenes is basically thuggery.  See other reviews for plot summaries.
That being said, I thought the performance of his co-star, Agata Buzek, was absolutely dreadful.  Her character should have made a wonderful counter-point to his - a fellow tortured soul searching for meaning in what her life has become.  But as written & portrayed she came off as emotionally . . .  thin.  Her dialogue & soliloquies seemed stilted.
And if you want a soul-satisfying tale of ""redemption"",  it will probably fall short.  However, if you accept that broken people do what they can, the best they can, in a brutal world - then you'll be satisfied.",1384473600,,1157,4.531400966183575

It is with deep regret that I have to report that this movie does irreparable damage to the reputations of the above mentioned gentlemen. Where to begin.....

A nun (one of the lead characters) saying ""I'm hungry"" and the camera immediately panning to a portrait of a naked man and then zooms in on a part of the male anatomy! The script is poor, the acting lame and the characters so weak that it all conspires to give an un intended comedic value.
So while the trailer may spark some interest this film should come with a warning. Perhaps it will be used in film schools to inform students of how not to make a movie. The only redemption is that if you download at home you could always paint a bedroom wall, watch it dry, by which time hopefully the credits will be running.",1383177600,4,926,4.285714285714286

5838552,4,B00DOBD482,"I would fully expect a lot of Jason Statham fans to be disappointed with this movie, and those expecting the usual fast paced wall to wall action may feel a little let down.
Credit to the star who seems to be churning out a lot of pictures to a standard formula these days, it doesn't seem to matter which side of the law the character he portrays is on, the audience seems to be rooting for him. Again, he's usually highly principled, honorable and of course hard as nails.
Redemption takes a different approach, although some key elements remain.
After a brief but brutal opening we find Statham as an ex military soldier with a checkered past, living the life of a bum on the street. After he suffers a beating at the hands of some street thugs, he fortuitously ends up hiding in an empty upscale apartment, the owner of which is away for 6 months. This was the only real part of the film that stretched credulity for me, in this day and age, the ability to live out the life he does albeit briefly, would I suspect be highly unlikely.
Anyway, enough about that. After the young girl he shared a cardboard box goes missing, and he's able to turn his life around he gains some employment. While searching for the girl, he then becomes an enforcer for the Chinese underworld in London, a job that brings rich rewards, but troubles his conscience.
Frequently revisiting the soup kitchen and Nun who runs it (an absorbing and interesting sub plot) he sets about trying to atone for his past life, save the girl, and make amends with his ex, and daughter who doesn't know him - hence the title of the movie.
The acting is excellent, and Statham shows some real depth instead of the usual ass kicking dead pan delivery.
I won't spoil the movie, but if you go in knowing that it's a slow burner, with layers of story, and believable if infrequent action you will probably enjoy it.
I gave it 4 stars, a little generous maybe, but for a change of direction I liked it.",1382918400,2,1963,4.4404432132963985

Jason Statham has a fairly typical role as a traumatized, down-and-out British ex-Special Forces officer or NCO who's on the run from a court martial over a certain SNAFU that occurred while he was serving in Afghanistan. Attempting to find the hoodlums who murder his lady friend from the streets, he assumes a new identity, gets a job with the local Chinese mafia, and is helped immensely by Russian nun ""Cristina,"" aptly played by Polish actress Agata Buzek. As usual, Statham plays a mentally wounded and outcast character who, paradoxically, is so tough and adept at martial arts that he never encounters a foe--or even a group of five or six of them--who can even give him a decent fight. Still, the character of ""Joey"" is more developed and humanized than a lot of other Statham star-roles. Big fans of the traditional Statham may not like this one as much as some of his previous flicks, but I like it much better. There's plenty of the usual wham-bang beat-'em-up type stuff, but it doesn't dominate the entire film as it did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Safe/dp/B008UO5U9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Safe</a>&nbsp;and certain others.

It takes a while to figure out everything that's supposed to be going on in REDEMPTION. The entire plot is meandering and rather patchy--there are a number of blanks here that might benefit from some filling in. Still, it kept my attention, and I absolutely loved the ending.

5838575,5,B00DOBD482,"The title of the film is deceptive.  Jason Statham plays Joey Jones a returning Special Forces soldier who committed atrocities while stationed in Afghanistan.  Living under a cardboard box on the London streets Joey salves his guilt in booze and drugs.  He develops a relationship with a fellow homeless woman, Isabel, who later disappears.  Joey finds refuge in an abandoned flat that is conveniently vacant while its owner is away for business in America.  Cleaning himself up he is noticed by some Asian mobsters when he bounces some rowdy soccer fans from the restaurant he's working in.  Joey is quickly hired as a debt collector and becomes flush with cash.  It is while plying this trade that word filters to him that Isabel was working as a prostitute and killed by a vicious john which causes Joey to seek revenge.  You ask yourself is this redemption or retribution?  Ah, there is a twist.  While on the streets Joey forges a bond with Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek), a nun who works on the streets feeding the poor.  You wouldn't think there would be a connection between the two but Sister Cristina is doing penance for an incident in her past life in her native Poland.  For this there is a kinetic bond between the brutish Joey and the beatific Cristina that is quite tender and beautiful.  You also ask whose redemption is it, Joey or Cristina's?  For those who would dismiss Statham as a lightweight, some have argued he can't act, should take note of his work here.  When given material he can sink his teeth into as he has here Statham elevates his game.  Statham has never had a female co-star of the caliber of Buzek and she draws out of him emotions you never thought him capable of.  This film is helmed expertly by Steven Knight and grittily lensed by Chris Menges who won Academy Awards for his work on ""The Killing Fields"" and ""The Mission"".  This film may disappoint a lot of Statham's core fans but those who are charting his progress as an actor this film is a revelation.",1380844800,69,2000,4.6335227272727275
5838576,4,B00DOBD482,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Over the years, Jason Statham's work has become a blurry haze of violent films that seem to lack any depth or substance. There's a story present, of course, but the narrative more or less provides a framework for the violence instead of attempting to create something meaningful. Now don't get me wrong, I love Statham. His anti-hero persona is addicting in action, but it always fails to leave a lasting impression. Because of this, I always find myself hesitant when approaching a new film of his, but there was something about Redemption's synopsis that grabbed me.

Redemption (aka Hummingbird in the United Kingdom and Crazy Joe in France) follows the story of former Royal Marine Joseph ""Joey"" Smith (Statham). After coming home from a tour of duty, Joey finds himself broken, beaten, and homeless. It doesn't take long before he takes on the identity of another man after being beaten in an alleyway and chased into a stranger's apartment. Seeing this as an opportunity, Joey starts working to turn his life around. That is, until a friend of his is murdered and he's faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life: whether or not he should pursue his vengeful desires.

Considering Redemption has Jason Statham at the forefront, the action in this film is quite tame. If my memory serves me correctly, there were only two major fistfights and very little gunfire -- most of which is done through flashbacks and one hallucination. While that may seem odd given his past work, I must admit it was a nice change of pace. It put more attention on the story and, in my opinion, it made the film better because of it. Redemption attempts to tell a story that revolves around violence, yes, but also one that delves into the traumatized psyche of a former Marine.

One of the things I really loved about Redemption was just how real Joey felt as a person. You could see his pain and you witnessed his struggle. Here was a man who was broken. Here was a man who was damaged by his actions in battle, but he accepted it. He may have been unable to cope with it, but he accepted it. In his eyes he was working for something and once that something was complete he understood that he would have to go back in hiding. Because of this, this is easily one of the most down-to-earth roles I've seen from Statham and, for most of the movie, he excels.

With that said, though, Redemption is far from perfect. Among other things, there were certain aspects of the story that were just... weird. It's not necessarily that these story elements were so over-the-top that they would have felt awkward in any movie, but they definitely felt out of place in the story being told. Unfortunately, I can't give any specific examples without compromising the story. Also, Redemption suffers from some severe pacing issues towards the end of the second act. Joey's work within London's criminal underworld flies by in a matter of minutes which left that part of the story feeling underdeveloped.

Now, as I said earlier, Statham excels in his performance as Joey. Not just because it's the first role I've seen from him that feels genuinely serious, but because you could tell that he gave it everything he had. Sure, there are still those usual Statham moments of him being an intimidating badass, but when it's all said and done it's the heart of his character that really shines through. He gave Joey life. He made him a breathing, vulnerable human being and he didn't ease up until the credits began to roll. In addition, while most of the attention is put on Statham, you also have Agata Buzek who plays the equally flawed Sister Cristina. I can't say she left a huge impression, but she played her part well given her somewhat limited screen-time.

Finally, the score, composed by Dario Marianelli, was, surprisingly, very enjoyable. I may have went in expecting the usual action-thriller shtick, but Dario gave me something entirely different. His compositions were very somber and eerie, but, because of this, they provided the perfect atmosphere for the story being told. They were dark, heavy, and, at times, a bit overwhelming, but that's what made them so enjoyable. Overall, the music did a wonderful job of complementing the narrative and I'm probably going to check out the soundtrack just to see if the pieces translate well as standalone music.

Overall Score: 7.75/10 - I'll be honest, I went into this with very low expectations. Most of Jason Statham's recent work has made me very pessimistic about his films, but Redemption really surprised me. The story may not be perfect, but it's definitely enjoyable and Statham gives a killer performance as Joey. If you have the time, and you're a fan of Jason Staham, then I would recommend you give this a shot. Just go in with an open mind and try to appreciate the film for what it is.",1380758400,,4887,4.73443008225617

Stumbling upon a vacant (only in movies) swanky apartment, with all the nicest things there for his use, and amazingly they all fit and they are the latest styles as well.

5838580,3,B00DOBD482,"Redemption is a movie about a homeless and on the run from a military court martial,damaged ex-special forces soldier (Statham) who is navigating London's criminal underworld and finds a way to seize an opportunity to assume another man's identity -- transforming into an avenging angel in the process.

I was surprised a bit at this movie as I have been looking for a good Statham movie since the original Transporter...a lot of his roles since then have been the same old..same old and frankly several have been disappointing at bringing nothing new but this was different than the standard Statham action movie playing the same character.  Some people might be disappointed as this is less action than the usual Statham action fare and actually brings a story with some heart and conflict at the same time.

Whereas Statham plays the role of the mob thug in the movie trying to find a way back from the demons, this movie concentrates less on the action part and more on the conflict between the main character's demons and his conscious, provided in the nun who isn't sure what her own path is.

Statham does a good job at playing the role and Agata Buzek excels as the nun who struggles with her own path in life.
The movie starts a little slowly but does have action in the right places without muddling the story unnecessarily.

One thing that made me like the movie as it didn't have your typical happy ending and did a good job at depicting the no easy answers to life and your demons message.

Definitely one of the better Statham movies I have seen in a while and a worthwhile watch. 3 and half stars.",1380585600,3,1612,4.599303135888502

5838590,5,B00DOBD482,"Having watched all of Statham's movies so far, even the bad ones, I've often wondered if he could do something serious and more dramatic than his Transporter type roles. This movie proves that he can. Though he is still type-cast as the tough guy, this script requires a more dramatic and nuanced performance of him than he has so far produced, and I believe he's done it well. Thought the film is predictable in places and filled with stereotypical characters, the story is nevertheless interesting and the performances of the lead characters are enjoyable. Overall the film reminds of some old black and white performances of 1930's tough-guys such as Bogart and Cagney. Statham, though, brings his own larger than life style to make the film uniquely his. I hope that he will next take the challenge of breaking out of the tough guy role to try something completely different.",1380240000,,879,4.866666666666666

5838593,3,B00DOBD482,"This is definitely a little different than your typical ""Statham movie"": there's minimal ass-kicking and something of a relatable, real-world plot at the center of this British import.  Statham stars as a veteran suffering from PTSD who is left homeless, violently attacked and, miraculously, given a second chance at life through a huge stroke of luck.  Unfortunately, there are waaay too many coincidences from start to finish, which makes ""Redemption"" feel more like an unbelievable, episodic adventure rather than a tight story tied together at every turn.  It's worth watching once for its moody atmosphere and Statham's solid performance, but there's too much wrong at the heart of the story to keep you coming back to this one.

Lionsgate's Blu-ray offers terrific A/V quality but only one short (and not very informative) behind-the-scenes featurette.  Not a terrible choice for a rental, but there's not enough here to make it worth a purchase.",1380067200,,953,5.243421052631579

5838596,4,B00DOBD482,"OK I will admit I am confused.  This movie has none of the things I usually enjoy in a movie (other than some nice acting from Joey and the Nun) and all of the things I usually hate; thuggery, violence, mindlessness.  I watched it because of the title Redemption, and ok because of Statham too.  So, howcome I am here reviewing it and giving it a good rating?

On the down side it is about a military guy with PTSD living on the streets who stumbles, literally, into an empty apartment.  Uses it as a base together with the rather nice car, and works on getting clean and sober, and of course fighting fit.  Then when you expect the redemption bit to kick in he begins working as an enforcer for the Chinese mafia, seduces a Nun and kills a guy by slinging him off the top of a building.  Its an unusual redemption, but he does get around to sending lorry loads of pizza and chinese take away to the soup kitchen, and dropping off a suitcase full of cash to his abandoned wife.

Not your usual tough guy movie but there is something different enough to make it enjoyable even if like me, you usually want a bit more.  There were some subtle bits of humor I enjoyed.  Like taking the Nun to an art gallery featuring gay still life photography, with lots of penises.  I loved the soup kitchen guys too - a real gem of a subplot.  Most unusually I wanted to know more - as it ended I wondered where he would go and what would become of him.

There's like that startling jolt, but then initially, you don't even necessarily realize it, there's like a slight twinge. That's how this movie starts. You're like ""HEY! What the hell was that all about?"" Time passes, you're sitting there....and then the pain starts. It's slow at first, like ""Hey, this doesn't feel great at all,"" and then it's just creeping up into your stomach. It just gets worse, you breathe deeper hoping to hold back the discomfort, but then you're like ""Oh man, am I gonna poop?"" Yeah, that is how this movie progresses. You're just like ""How did this happen?? WHY!!? Who would do this?"" And these questions are the same whether you're watching this movie or dealing with getting hit in the groin. Same same. Then after a really long while, things start to calm down a bit. Oh sure, you're still not comfortable. You've got this feeling in the background that just won't settle down, but you feel yourself easing into it, a few more deep breaths, all good, right? Yeah, it's over, and you've never been happier to have something come to an end. That's this movie. Now imagine Jason Statham in your groin.

His character is a confused mess of being altruistic, vigilante, and bad man.

He feels he must avenge the death of another street urchin, although her character and their relationship had about zero development. The action scenes are quick while there are long scenes of him having conversation with a nun, which seriously is not Statham's long suit. If you want to just watch the beat 'em up Statham, you can fast forward through 95% of the film.

I am not sure why Statham decided to take on such a complex character, he doesn't pull it off too well. 3 stars is a stretch.

5838697,5,B00DOBD482,"Jason Statham and Agata Buzek are terrific in this beautifully filmed neo-noir piece.  Redemption has the nuanced pace of an art house film, and contrasts the sleek impersonality of modern London with the casual brutality of the denizens of the underworld.

Agata Buzek is a wonder, alternately funny, wry and poignant, while Statham morphs from hapless bum to ne'er-do-well thug to a man with a mission, keeping the viewer firmly on his side as he struggles to be a good man in bad circumstances.

The immediate surprise of Redemption is how utterly charming Buzek and Statham are in their roles, with a spark reminiscent of old Hollywood classics.

If you're a fan of modern noir like The Beat That Skipped My Heart, Read My Lips and Don't Tempt Me then this is a film for you.",1372809600,,779,4.705882352941177
5838698,5,B00DOBD482,"Jason Statham gives what I would argue is his best performance to date.  While he has long established his capabilities as an action star, his performance in Redemption showcases his ability to play a character with depth and dimension as well.

I found the overall movie to be extremely entertaining.  Frankly, the weakest dialog and acting was during some of the action scenes IMHO.  I strongly recommend giving this movie a viewing.  For what it is I give it 5 stars.  Cheers!",1372723200,49,479,4.780487804878049
5838699,4,B00DOBD482,"We are witnessing some very disturbing incidents in this country at present - senseless killings by soldiers who have been mentally bruised by the combat in the seemingly endless wars in the Middle East.  REDEMPTION brings an extreme example of how combat exposure can damage otherwise stable persons and if that aspect of the story could have been more explored the movie would have been better.

As it is REDEMPTION (aka HUMMINGBIRD for reasons obvious after seeing the film) is a fine Jason Statham movie as written and directed by Steven Knight who has given us Eastern Promises, Amazing Grace and Dirty Pretty Things. The film is greatly enhanced by the cinematography by Chris Menges and the original musical score by Dario Marianelli.  But in the end the film belongs to Jason Statham who may possible be offering his best role to date.

Joey Jones (Jason Statham) is an alcoholic, homeless military deserter on the run from a military court martial: being caught up in the life or death circumstances and the eye for an eye philosophy of the Afghanistani war zone he fled the unbearable trauma and has been hiding his memories in alcohol, living with street people, sharing a cardboard box with fellow homeless Isabel (Victoria Bewick). His food comes from a Redemption House mission run by nun Sister Cristina (the fine Polish actress Agata Buzek) who has past secrets of her own. One night Joey is beaten severely by gang members and Isabel escapes. After this Joey flees, falls (literally) into the fancy apartment of a photographer who is on vacation and there he decides to turn his life around. He gives up alcohol, works out on the roof to rebuild his body, shaves his long hair, dresses in the owner's clothes, uses the owner's TM card for money and sets out to make a living working in a Chinese restaurant. His talents as a brilliant fighter are noted and soon he is making big money working as a `fixer', and his life becomes one of an avenging angel, giving his `fixer' earnings to Sister Cristina and to his ex-wife and child. The action is non-stop with many intrusions of nightmares from Joey's experiences in Afghanistan, the subplots are strong, and though some aspects of each of the characters are not fully drawn, there is enough of a forward lunging story to satisfy - even the rather surprising ending. Certainly this is a film that will satisfy the legions of Jason Statham fans. Grady Harp, June 13",1372464000,44,2430,4.7785714285714285

8595343,1,B00DOBD482,"The description of the film indicates a ""high-octane, action thriller. It was none of these things. There was little action and it almost seemed misplaced in this snooze fest of a film, when it did occur. It most certainly was not high-octane, and wasn't a thriller. It was so slow paced, it lost me at points.  While it is in English, I don't believe it was produced for American audiences. The speech was hard to understand with both accents and sound. The sound person should have been fired.  The description also offers up that he is driven to revenge by the death of a good friend.  This relationship is not developed and barely plays a part in the movie. While Statham's character does seek revenge, it is barely noticeable in the film until the very end.  I think they need to market this film differently starting with the movie description. It is deceiving and I expected more from this Statham film. It was definitely a departure from his usual work, but they need to let you know that up front. Most would be disappointed if you like his old stuff.",1528675200,,1060,4.563157894736842
