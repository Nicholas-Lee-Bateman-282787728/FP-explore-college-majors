4102120,4,B003AI2EKI,"If you've ever watched Cinemax After Dark, you've seen this movie or one like it.  Production value is high.  Acting is on par for this style of movie.  People are good looking.  Sets are someone's multi-million dollar home.  Lot's of simulated sex, full frontal female nudity & shower scenes.  Pets & pornstars abound.  Cheesy story line, but let's be honest, did we really buy this for an Oscar winning performance?  My only question is this, 's the next one going to be released?",1275264000,22,482,4.72289156626506

8392980,3,B003AI2EKI,"Even Though This Kind Of Thing is Unhealthy and Unwise I Give Heather Vandeven and Christine Ngyuen This, They're Not Shy and They Weren't Hit With an Ugly Stick!",1402531200,,162,4.620689655172414
8392981,3,B003AI2EKI,"What can I say about this film? It is what it is. A soft core porn-sci-fi-comedy filmed at some rich guy's house. This is Cinemax After Dark fodder. The credits are an homage to Star Trek II...I think. The CGI looks decent considering the low budget. The ""plot"" is just set ups for nudity and soft core sex scenes. Housewives From Another World(2010) is junk food cinema for bad movie junkies.",1360281600,3,393,4.549295774647887
8392982,3,B003AI2EKI,"I am not a prude by any means and actually enjoy seeing a lovely female nude.

However, there is so much nudity and softcore sex in this movie that it took away from the story.

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy a bit of nudity but in the context of the storyline.

And yes, there was a storyline that in spite of the copious amount of nudity did unfold and I thought it was a rather novel take on a genre that has been shown to a great length.

The ladies are beautiful and the production values seem to be a bit above what is normal for this type of film.

Will you be sorry if you look at this? No.  But you will wish there was just a little less sex more concentration of the story.",1350259200,,683,3.9130434782608696
8392983,5,B003AI2EKI,"If you're a fan of softcore, then this is one to own! Full Frontal Female Nudity!! Great shower scene by Heather Vandeven! You will not be disappointed with this one!",1294444800,4,166,4.566666666666666
8392984,4,B003AI2EKI,"OK, nobody cares about the plot, but for the record, some  woman finds some meteorite and is possessed by an alien being or some such nonsense. And in a ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" twist, the alien is there for good intentions.

That aside, this thing is loaded to the hilt with sex and has a fair amount of graphic nudity (the best kind). Heather Vandeven--who really needs to save up her money and do something about those hideous scars underneath her fake breasts--makes it four times in the movie's first 12 minutes. One of those is with herself in the shower, and that one is the highlight of the picture. Seriously, it goes farther than what you typically see in soft-core films.

Based on the strength of that scene alone this could earn four stars. But it would have received five (I love Rebecca Love...no pun intended) if not for shoddy editing work of shoddier camera work and the shoddiest direction. I don't mean of the exposition, silly...I mean of the sex scenes, of course. Vandeven in particular seems reticent to get too up close and personal and the videography, editing and direction don't hide it well. One scene made it really obvious that her face was about 14 inches away from where she was trying to pretend that it was. Also there was more than one instance in which the sling that the male actors have to wear was visible in the shot.

So, that's my only really big qualm with this one. It also could have used one more female cast member--maybe one with natural breasts to balance out Vandeven's scars.",1277942400,18,1530,4.572992700729927
