8197037,4,B000QRIK7W,"I found this to be a very good movie, Vic Morrow played his part to its fullest. There were parts that didn't really move the plot along but not many. Morrow's character was an evil man on a mission that stayed a mystery even from some of the other players. All in all a good movie from the late 70s",1453507200,,299,4.0

8197042,2,B000QRIK7W,"Funeral for an Assassin, 1975 film

The movie starts with a man playing a tape. We see a woman being followed in Johannesburg South Africa. [Note the technique.] The viewer sees two women switch identical handbags on the street! Two other men chase the other woman, who runs away until stopped by an accident. The other woman dies suddenly. We see old computers in a government office. There was a mark on a map, they will investigate this location. A diplomat is arrested at the airport; he is very angry after his strip search. A man gets a pile of money to do a job. Elsewhere men cross a river in a rubber raft. Soldiers shoot at them, the targets shoot back. One man is captured. At another location ""Michael Carter"" meets a contact and learns manners. That captured man is questioned. Carter arrives at his new home. We see an old man in a wheelchair. He will be guarded better.

Men clean the floor in a hospital. One worker slips away for a minute and does his real job. Security Captain Roos gets a telephone call about the injured prisoner. A man meets a woman in a dress shop. The assassin strikes again. An Identi-kit is used to create a picture of the suspect. Carter visits an abandoned mineshaft, then disguises himself again. He slides down the mineshaft in a scheme to steal explosives. Captain Roos deducts the reason about the death of Judge Whitfield: a state funeral with a lot of important people. Raymond works alone. Roos visits the Slumber Room. He shoots at the intruder but misses. [Note the P-38 pistol.] The intruder disappears outside! Who ordered that roadwork? Roos orders a search by computer for suspects and works hard. Raymond will not take any more risks. The police arrive at that cottage too late. There is a chase but Raymond escapes on a bus. People on the bus notice him. He escapes again!

The computer identifies the dead man; a follower of Brother Raymond. He was presumed dead in a prison escape. But Raymond has another plan. The state funeral will go on; Roos is suspended! Roos is invited to the funeral. The preacher arrives and is checked out. The ceremony begins (they speak Afrikaans, a Dutch dialect). The preacher lays a wreath on the casket. Roos suspects something, he removes the wreath and leaves the church with it. Will the bomb go off? Not if it is stopped in time! There is a chase on motorcycles. The police are notified. Roos chases the suspect to a mining area, then disconnects the suspect's spark cable. There is an explosive and ironic end to this story.

This lower-budget movie was filmed entirely on location in South Africa. Its background is an advantage; the lack of clarity in the film a minus. The many disguises of the assassin echoes the earlier movie ""The Jackal"" (a better drama). The use of a bomb at a funeral reminds me of a novel by Per Wahloo. [Does the old man in a wheelchair represent the South African government that was soon to terminate?]",1343606400,,2931,4.609195402298851
