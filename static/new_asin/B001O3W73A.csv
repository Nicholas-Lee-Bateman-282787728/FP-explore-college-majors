I hadn't expected to, but I found myself laughing a lot , and who doesn't love Vegas! I'm glad it's now on my self.",1237075200,5,285,4.2

It was funnier than we though it would be.  If you like vegas, hot nude chicks, and caper flix this is your film. If you want great cinema rent ""Gone with the Wind.""",1236556800,6,320,3.876923076923077
3726559,5,B001O3W73A,"I attended The Casino Job Las Vegas Movie Premiere at the Silverton Pavillion this week that was well received by a full house. It's great to see a local Vegas Production company hit with a movie that portrays Real Las Vegas. The cast is as Hot in person as they are on the big screen and the entertaining story line carried some good twists. Not to give away the story line entirely, but this film is about 5 sexy Las Vegas strippers that create an elaborate plot to take revenge on a Casino Owner.

8329216,4,B001O3W73A,"When Jenny (Amylia Joiner) claim that casino owner Barry (Dean Mauro) her three stripper friends work with her to scam Barry out of money and have the gaming commission shut him down.  This is really a bad plot. It no Ocean's 11. Acting wasn't that great either. Story was short, but the film did have FF nudity and  lots of topless women.

4 stars for the perv factor.

F-bomb, sex, brief rape, nudity (Amylia Joiner, Ilsa Martinez, Irina Voronina, Deanna Minerva, Julia Louise plus others)",1433376000,,491,4.741176470588235
8329217,3,B001O3W73A,"I'd give it 4+ - 5 stars except the music is played over the actors speaking. Now granted you don't buy a movie like this for the dialogue, but it still was annoying. Lots of great nudity,",1430956800,,188,4.108108108108108
8329218,1,B001O3W73A,"This was filmed in 1.78:1 in 2009. Maverick released the DVD in 2009 as Pan Scan 1.33:1. Unbelievable!. With an asking price of $29 there should be lots of features, but not even subtitles are included. Anything more than $2 for this release is a rip off.

And some advice to Maverick - the move toward widescreen home TVs happened a decade ago!",1426896000,,345,4.476190476190476
8329219,4,B001O3W73A,"I would like to say first thing I hate giving reviews. Why because as a buyer we look at that as a source of information before,we buy the product.plus what I like or don't might  not be what you like.
Okay the main reason I bought the movie was because I wanted something with the Russian playmate Irona Voronina in it. She was also in the recent Piranna 3dd, Irona was the  busty nude women going down the water slide in the beginning of the movie.
So I bought the film because she was in the movie.
The movie is a bit slow paced at times like some have mentioned but the good, it does have a decent amount of nudity throughout the movie, to  help keep you interested in the film.
The acting won't wow you, but keep in mind if your buying a movie with playmates running around nude, What would you expect the acting to be,great.
I will give it 4 stars because it might be slow at times, but it does have a nice mix of nudity in the film. So if you watching the movie you will get plenty of skin.
The cast is pretty attractive in my oppinion. So giving the skin and frequent nudity of the cast,it's okay, and the movie is cheap,Which makes it a good buy for that reason alone.",1350432000,,1177,4.131004366812227

As you recall those stomach churning moments of ""Lost Wages"", plan to feel the same way if you watch this bomb.

8329221,3,B001O3W73A,"Set in Nevada, The Casino Job (2009) is an independent film about a group of strippers that scheme to take revenge on a casino owner.  While the storyline seems to hold together well enough, this is not a film that showcases the glamour and glitz of Vegas.  The targeted casino is not a megaresort like The Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, or The Wynn.  Here, we are dealing with a small local's casino, so if you are expecting high class and affluence, you will be sadly disappointed.  The name of the casino is not mentioned, but the Avi Resort and Casino, in Laughlin, appears in the film, and used as a location for filming.

Except for the frequent instances of nudity, the film has a low budget, or made for TV look.  The acting talent is a mixed assortment, with some in key roles, making their film debuts.  At times the acting suffers, or the dialog isn't very polished, but that might be expected in a semi-exploitive, low budget project, that features all of the leading ladies getting naked.  The film was written and directed by Christopher Robin Hood, who incorporates his experiences from working as a dealer in Las Vegas, into his screenplay.

Barry (Dean Mauro) a casino owner, hires a group of four strippers to appear at his home, to impress some business associates.  After the party winds up, one of girls, Jennifer (Amylia Joiner), later claims that Barry raped her after the others had left.  When going to the police fails, the ladies (Joiner, Ilsa Mariel, Julia Beatty, Deanna Minerva) decide to get revenge.  To do this, they need help, and enlist the aid of Scribe (Jay Anthony Franke) a dealer at Barry's casino.  With his expertise, they formulate a plan to take Barry's money, and also cause him to lose his gaming license.

The team comes together (in more ways than one), with the addition of Duncan (Curtis Joe Walker), a cashier in Barry's casino, and Paradise (Irina Voronina), a stripper that Barry is attracted to.  Locating a suitable employee of the Nevada Gaming Commisson, clears the way for the plan to proceed.  When the opportunity comes, the quick thinking of Paradise (who is quite the player), keeps the plan on course to success, and she also thwarts Barry's attempt at revenge.  In the end, everyone gets screwed in one form or another, but in a mean twist, the players get played.

The Casino Job features a competently executed, but unflashy con job, and is only mildly recommended because of the titillation factor.  Writer/director Chris Hood's commentary is nice extra, but sometimes provides a bit too much background information, about how his low budget production came to be.  According to Hood, the card substitution ploy used to cheat the casino, had actually been done.  Irina Voronina (Playboy Playmate, January 2001), is a pretty decent actress, who brings some much needed personality and attitude to a key role, and along with Dean Mauro gives the film a more humorous edge.",1266537600,3,2933,4.81437125748503

8329223,1,B001O3W73A,"I had to keep fastforwarding this one just to make it somewhat bearable.  I wouldn't even have bothered had I not wanted to give it a fighting chance, but the sub-par acting, dialogue and tone in general did not help its cause.",1237852800,,227,4.404761904761905
