7936409,5,B00005B20B,"Once again, even though Nintendo Power will no longer sell the Pokemon comics anymore, I'm goin' to love this volume just like you told me.  They contain the following:
""The Chikorita Rescue"", featuring Chikorita, the grass-type beauty covered in a bunch of snow.  He's the smartest of the 3 starter pokemon that you can pick at the start of the game.
""Once in a Blue Moon"", featuring Quagsire, who tries to steal Ash Ketchum's special GS Ball.
And ""Whistle Stop"", featuring Ledyba, the familiar ladybug pokemon from Pokemon 2: The Movie.  This episode is like becoming a coach in a sports game like football for example.  When you blow the whistle, the game is about to start.  It's also used for time outs.
The reason why I'm goin' to love this ultimate volume is because of the following:
1.  It reminds me of Christmas.
2.  The GS Ball is used to capture Celebi.
3.  Blowing the whistle can be used for time outs or starts in certain sports games.
Once again, thank you for your cooperation on what to rank.  Good luck to all pokemon trainers out there.  For volume numbers 5 and 6, I'll see ya in July 2001.",988588800,3,1112,4.515
