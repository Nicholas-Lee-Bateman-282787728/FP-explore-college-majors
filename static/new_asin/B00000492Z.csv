7903268,4,B00000492Z,"This is a really nice DVD, and the stories are great, but I wish it were ""two minute bible stories"", as she narrates too quickly that you barely get any comprehension of the story.  I enjoy it because I know the stories, but I find it is too fast for the small children (which it is intended for).  Fewer stories at two minutes would have been better in my opinion, but this is a very hard DVD to get a hold of, so I am happy to have it, regardless.",1230076800,3,449,3.977777777777778
