But lots of wierd fetish stuff like sex with amputies, and disfigured people (most real). However, even though this was an NR version there was no coitus. A few distant shots of a very hairy crotch, and plenty of shots of limp male organs. Good acting though, and a very good story. If you are watching this for the sex scenes, go rent a Penthouse video. This was all about fetish and androgity. There are some very strange perversions and they show just how sick the Third Reich really was, as I understand pretty accurate. If you are an adult and enjoy real movies, this is as real as they get. If you are a prude and don't enjoy seeing the human body in all it's forms (some not very pleasant to look at), than definetly skip this one.",1127952000,74,842,4.509803921568627
1880764,3,B000096IBX,"Nazi sexploitation, this is one of the few film genres that the mention of it will at the least raise an eyebrow or two and at worst get you kicked you of your synogogue. It is really a twisted genre of cinema, fortunately it is completely unerotic.

Salon Kitty is what some people say to the best Tinto Brass film, if it is then I don't want to know what else he has in store (Caligula for one, rubbish, but not entirely his rubbish). The movie is about the recruitment of 20 young and idealistic girls into a brothel so that they could find and expose the people not entirely obiedient to Nazi ideology. Supposedly it was based on a true story, but I would not be slow to believe that Brass added his own little touch. The plot actually starts in the last half hour. Margarita and Kitty have to stop a power mad nazi officer who wants to usurp power from Hitler and rule the world.

The final half hour is at least interesting. The rest of the movie is not. It is convoluted, muddled and directionless. Pointless cabaret style acts are spliced between scenes adding considerable time to the already overlong movie. The dubbing reflects the poor sense of direction. It appears that some of the scenes were shot in Italian and others were shot in German and others were shot in English. Some of the scenes are not dubbed at all, making it imppossible to understand what is really going on in the movie and the dubbing is done in too many different ways to be consistent, some have British accents and others have German accents etc...

Brass needed an editor. He needed someone to tell him, ""this scene really looks great, but lets cut this other scene altogether."" This would not only shorten the movie but would help the direction of the movie. The half hour shows that Brass had true talent, and was perfectly capable of wielding the wand of personal voice, but the rest of the movie also reveals his darker side, the side of a thirteen year old with a camera and a bunch of girls not wearing clothes.",1102982400,2,2005,4.4577656675749315
1880765,2,B000096IBX,"Interesting only because it was made by Europe's premier exploitation director, ""Kitty"" is tedious and has pretensions to being an expose of the Nazis. This film is nothing more than a forerunner of the Italian (...) genre that flourished briefly in the 1970's. As to the controversial and perverse elements - they are clumsily handled and pointless. You'll find more (...) readily available elsewhere and the horror of the Nazis is presented much more graphically and forcefully in movies by Speilberg and Polanski to name but two.

1880767,3,B000096IBX,"Director Tinto Brass is probably better known for lensing the controversial film ""Caligula"" starring Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, and Peter O'Toole than he is for the sleazy little number called ""Salon Kitty."" Made five years before the Vidal/Guccione/Brass ""Caligula"" collaboration, ""Salon Kitty"" sports several similarities to Brass's later production. This film also takes a historical setting as its starting point, specifically National Socialist Germany of the 1930s. The film boasts similarly impressive set pieces constructed by Oscar winner Ken Adam of ""Barry Lyndon"" fame (this is saying something because ""Barry Lyndon"" is one of the best period pieces ever put to film, in large part due to the costumes and sets). ""Salon Kitty"" even casts the beautiful Teresa Ann Savoy in a major role as the young Aryan prostitute Margherita (she played Caligula's sister in ""Caligula""). Yep, it is easy to make plenty of comparisons between this movie and the later ""Caligula."" It is also quite simple to make comparisons of the bad traits in both films because ""Salon Kitty"" tends to bore more than it titillates.
Specifically, ""Salon Kitty"" takes place in 1939 Berlin just as the German military readies itself for war. At some point, higher ups decide to assemble the best examples of young Aryan womanhood in order to train them as prostitutes in service to the German soldiers. A German officer of supposedly impeccable standards, Helmut Wallenberg, runs this new training program. Wallenberg, who has his own nasty little secrets, comes across as the archetype of every German officer portrayed in films since the end of World War II: he is imperious, cold, calculating, and as cruel as they come. In order to put his plan into action, Wallenberg enlists the services of Madam Kitty, a brothel owner of some note who spends her evenings performing cabaret numbers for the customers. Kitty scoffs at Wallenberg's suggestions until the German officer closes down her business in order to force her into service to the state. Kitty finally acquiesces to the Germans and proceeds to turn the young Aryan gals into carbon copies of the prostitutes she once presided over at her brothel. What follows are endless scenes of partying, nudity, and cabaret numbers as Kitty and her coterie perform for the fatherland.
Unknown to Kitty and the nubile Margherita, Wallenberg runs the brothel as a cover for a massive spying operation complete with bugged rooms, bugged telephones, and blackmail. And there is great potential for blackmail as high-ranking National Socialists show up to party with Kitty and the gang. All the while the tape recorders run away behind the walls, capturing any hint of criticism directed against the German government. Margherita eventually discovers these shenanigans when she falls in love with one of her clients only to discover later that the authorities arrested and executed him for treasonous comments he made in the brothel. Armed with deep suspicions about her role as a prostitute, Margherita approaches Kitty and together the two launch their own private war against Wallenberg and his henchmen.
""Salon Kitty"" is a sick, morally reprehensible film. The party scenes are exercises in sleaze, with swastikas adorning the most unusual of objects. Every character engages in the most nauseating of acts, and Brass tosses out gruesome scenes in an autopsy room and a slaughterhouse just in case you forget you are watching a movie about National Socialist Germany. The worst scene comes early in the film, and I am not going to say anymore about it except to say you will know it when you see it. In addition to the sordid scenes, the movie further offends with a poor script, mediocre acting, and pacing that absolutely plods along. The picture seems to run for an eternity due to these elements and a few others. Madam Kitty and Margherita don't even put the pieces together about Wallenberg until well into the movie, long after most of the viewers have long wearied of the whole exercise. About the only thing I enjoyed about ""Salon Kitty"" was Madam Kitty's cabaret numbers and watching the beautiful Teresa Ann Savoy. I think ""Salon Kitty"" serves as a good example of what occurred in certain filmmaking circles in the 1970s: overly long, overly pretentious attempts to weld sleaze with art house pretensions.
The DVD version of ""Salon Kitty,"" put together by William Lustig's Blue Undergound, gives more attention to this film than it really deserves. The transfer is widescreen and looks darn good for a movie of this age. There are tons of extras, too, including interviews with Tinto Brass and Ken Adam, gallery stills, radio spots, and a trailer for the film. When ""Salon Kitty"" originally came out in the 1970s, the U.S. print suffered numerous cuts and arrived on our shores under the name ""Madam Kitty."" Completists, like me, will appreciate Lustig's generous restoration of the film while lamenting that the movie really isn't that great. Still, I've seen much, much worse than ""Salon Kitty,"" so spending a couple of hours with it wasn't a complete loss. If you really must see this film, try and rent it instead of buying it.",1065916800,54,5173,5.058548009367682
1880768,3,B000096IBX,"First of all, there is no ""sexual perversion"" or ""sexual atrocities"" in this film. But it IS brought to you by the director of ""Caligula"". ""Salon Kitty"" is a very lush, very raunchy and very graphic sexploitation film set in 1939 Europe about an SS officer who converts a popular brothel into a spy operation staffed with specially trained and selected girls. The madam, Kitty (Ingrid Thulin), doesn't understand why she had to relocate and restaff and is unaware of the covert goings on. It supposedly is being done to blackmail certain officials but this kind've takes a back seat to the nudity and sexual cavorting. The officer (Helmut Berger) is a twisted and tortured soul---incapable of any sort of sexual relations or relationships. The heroine, prostitute Margarita (Teresa Ann Savoy), looks innocent but is capable of handling the most demanding situations imaginable. She ends up cluing Kitty into what's going on and helping bust the whole thing open. Nazi symbols are everywhere (even on garters!) and some scenes are mind-boggling in their silliness. At times I was wondering if the whole thing was a satire. But some non-sexual scenes (like the slaughterhouse) are repellent in the extreme. The costumes are extravagant and beautiful and suited to the decadence of the brothel. Miss Kitty's song numbers (oh yes, she performs, too) are a bit much in their Dietrich-esque sultriness.  Thulin resembles an aging drag queen as she carries on in her over-the-top costumes and blonde wigs. Savoy is pretty (and looks disturbingly too young) but cannot act for love nor money. And she has chances at both in this film. Berger is all pomp and starch as the officer. He's believable. You wonder if he's gay at times. He refuses the services of Kitty's girls but tries with Savoy. It's unpleasant because he's too cold and too far gone. The sex in ""Salon Kitty"" IS rather repulsive but there's ample male and female nudity for voyeurs. The soundtrack is good---with appropriately decadent music and song numbers suited to the period and place. The DVD print is mostly good but ranges from too dark in some scenes to quite vivid in others. Overall, it's watchable with plenty of extras and a second disc all about ""Salon Kitty"". A collector's item for those with a taste for this sort of thing. Just be careful who you show it to. It's very strange stuff.",1058140800,112,2359,4.882793017456359

1880777,3,B000096IBX,"With Gore Vidal as author of the screenplay and Bob Guccione of ""Penthouse Magazine"" to provide backing, director Tinto Brass had achieved some notoriety and success with his 1979 film, ""Caligula"" which remained in a lot of people's minds as the epitome of the best of the ""pushing the envelope"" variety, as the film was porn with major stars like Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, even John Gielgud and Helen Mirren in the cast.  Well, now on blu-ray for around $40.00 each comes what was done before it, practically the same year, a story Brass borrowed from the famous 1964 controversial film, ""The Balcony"" and made ""Salon Kitty"" released in this country at first as simply ""Madam Kitty.""  Besides Brass as director, and in one of the few extras with the blu-ray, extended director's cut, the clearly not starving Brass claims he edits all his own work, so why others are listed in directories as editors remains unclear; both films feature who is now getting rave reviews, a one Teresa Ann Savoy, who for what is claimed as should be A-list beautiful actress, fares no better in the looks department than the least of most of the lesser beauties there have been, and that goes for acting ability, too.  Ingrid Thulin and Helmut Berger get top honors for their performances, which I think elevate ""Salon Kitty"" above ""Caligula"" as far as story and ideas go.  Screenplay was by E. De Concini, M.P. Fusco and Tinto Brass.  Director of Photography is Silvano Ippoliti, production design by Ken Adam, and Costumes by Ugo Pericoli and Jost Jakob.  The film is like a wild fantasy, but very disturbing.  Sometimes one surmises Brass would be served better if someone else did the editing as some images look like they need more work or another hand in giving them polish.  It only seems natural that a movie such as ""Salon Kitty"" riding on the coattails of ""Caligula"" would be considered our best today.  Argent Films.

Does the lack of copulation ruin the movie, plot and all? Not really. The plot of a secret spy ring setting up a Nazi Officer Brothel would only have been better, if the ALLIES had pulled it off, in occupied France. The various KINK scenes are often derided, as offensive to 'silly,' are really showing the perversion of power. [Even though Tinto Brass has a reputation of ""porny-wood"" productions, like Caligula*; He DOES fancy himself a European Auteur filmmaker.]

The era costuming & design, the bringing out to mainstream of kink & fetish, the age-old use/misuse of prostitutes for individual gain reveal a classic story of how far some go when they get power to do all they want.

7989973,4,B000096IBX,"Nine Things About the Film ""Salon Kitty""

1. Many people have heard of exploitation films. But not everybody knows that the genre can be further subdivided. One of the more interesting sub-genres is the so-called ""naziploitation"" film. It's exactly what it sounds like - an exploitation film with Nazis.

Salon Kitty is not the first naziploitation film, but it is one of the most influential. This cult Italian film was made in 1976. When it came to America, it was edited down to make it a more typical X-rated sexploitation film and renamed Madam Kitty.

2. Salon Kitty was a high-class brothel in Berlin run by a woman named Kitty. In 1939, the SS took over the brothel and replaced all the prostitutes with new prostitutes that were also trained to be spies. Salon Kitty seduced important political figures in order to get them to talk about sensitive information or personal confessions. These conversations were recorded and used for blackmail. Salon Kitty served as the basis for spy brothels in many movies about WWII.

The movie Salon Kitty takes this real incident and runs with it. It was ready made for a nazisploitation treatment. Of course, the movie doesn't worry too much about real historical accuracy. It just provides the structure.

3. For those discerning movie fans who are familiar with the exploitation genre, I only have to mention that this movie was written and directed by Tinto Brass. That will explain everything.

For those not familiar with him, Tinto Brass was a well respected avante-garde film director in the 1960's-1970's, but after making Salon Kitty, he moved towards more, um, ""erotic dramas"". Naziploitation films are usually full of softcore porn, silly sadistic violence, and tons of naked people, both male and female. Tinto Brass is a master of this art form. While he puts less emphasis on violence than some other movies in the genre, this movie has plenty of sex. About half of the movie contains naked people, usually for no reason.

4. Before I watched this movie, I had never seen a woman's pubic hair be trimmed, shaved, powdered, and costumed. But now I have.

5. The movie begins with members of the SS on a quest to find a bunch of committed Nazi women willing to make themselves whores for the Third Reich. There's a big orgy scene in which Nazi men ""test"" the women to make sure they have potential to be prostitutes. The ones that pass that test are then given a second test, in which they are asked to have sex with a number of different people, including an old man, a man with a birth defect, and an amputee.

6. One of the Nazi leaders, Wallenberg, wears kinky uniforms that I'm pretty sure didn't exist in real life.

7. The movie looks great. There are very classy and impressive sets to hold the debauchery of the movie.

8. The movie also tries to make some actual statements about politics, ethics, and love. These are some of the things that were cut for the U.S. release, so many Americans didn't realize the movie was trying to be more than your typical sleaze-fest. For example, the character of Margherita is kind of a metaphor for the evolving attitudes towards Nazism through the course of the war. Kitty represents the efforts to remain neutral in a situation where every choice forces you to take a side.

Of course, Tinto Brass isn't a good enough writer to really take advantage of these issues, but you can find them if you look hard enough.

9. Salon Kitty isn't really very relevant today. It's melodramatic and overacted. It's a curious historical artifact that, in my opinion, represents a cultural effort to digest some of the elements of the war.

And yet, if you can handle lots of gratuitous nudity and sex, this is an entertainingly weird movie that serves as a good introduction to the genre for those that are interested.",1462665600,3,3812,4.7300150829562595
