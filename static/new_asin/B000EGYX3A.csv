2518584,5,B000EGYX3A,"Irreverent is an understatement for the characters played by Rodney Dangerfield in both ""Back to School"" and ""Easy Money.""  But if you love the hurkey-jerky movements of Rodney Dangerfield and admire his willingness to make a fool of himself, then these movies are for you.  If not, stay away.  I love the whole concept of the ""uncool"" latino in ""Easy Money,"" especially when he and his friend come to his father-in-law's home to attempt to win back his naive bride. I thought I'd fall off my seat.  Equally absurd in ""Back to School"" is Rodney himself, paunchy and raunchy, joining his son's college diving team and testing the wind before performing a ""triple lindy,"" a dive no one can do, let alone an old, out-of-shape business tycoon, who owns Tall and Fat Stores (clothing).
  Who cares about the plot (There is one in each film.) or the acting?  The situations are outrageous, in the old sense of the word, as outrageous as Rodney himself.  The man didn't take himself seriously.  I don't know why some of the condescending critics do.  As Rodney says in his graduation speech at the conclusion of ""Back to School"":""Look out for number one, but don't step in number 2.""",1287187200,,1176,4.720588235294118
2518585,3,B000EGYX3A,"I love Rodney, and Joe Pechi as his pot smoking friend was fun to watch.  But the time sadly, has passed for this kind of comedy.  It could be me... now closing in on 60... but the funny movies of my 30's just aren't what it used to be...",1277683200,,238,3.836734693877551
2518586,5,B000EGYX3A,"It's Rodney Dangerfield at his very best...twice.  I busted a gut laughing, repaired my gut just in time for it to get busted again.....I am still laughing.",1261612800,,156,4.777777777777778
2518587,5,B000EGYX3A,"A couple of Dad's favorites. He enjoyed watching these as well as Uncle Buck, Down Periscope, King Ralph...you can see the trend. He loved a good comedy.",1241827200,,153,4.703703703703703
2518588,5,B000EGYX3A,"I've always found Rodney Dangerfield to be very funny. This double pack includes two of his most hilarious movies. I've been watching them for years and I still laugh everytime at Rodney's amusing bright ideas, eccentric manners, funny jokes and sarcastic commentaries. Rodney, with his laugh-riot comedy is a great remedy for those bad days when you need someone to cheer you up. You can always count on his potent and humoristic medicine!  Rest in peace Rodney, your legacy lives on!",1236297600,,485,4.987654320987654
2518589,5,B000EGYX3A,"I was very excited to come across the package deal of these two movies, especially considering the amazing price.  What a steal for not one, but TWO Dangerfield classics.  The delivery was FAST and the quality of these products is an A+!  I will definitely be back!  Thank you!!! ;)",1220227200,,282,4.58
2518590,5,B000EGYX3A,If you like Rodney you will like these two films. I thought back to school was better than easy money but both were entertaining. Its clean humor too which doesnt exist anymore.,1214956800,,177,4.5625
2518591,5,B000EGYX3A,"These 2 films (aside from ""Caddyshack"") are Rodney Dangerfield at the top of his game. What a great idea to put them both on one disc. I have both films on separate DVDs, but would gladly trade 'em in for this space-saving combo package.

Ol' Rodney may be gone, and he didn't win any Oscars for his comic performances, but one thing's for sure: he kept me laughing from start to finish!

Long live Dangerfield!",1174521600,9,411,4.466666666666667

2518607,5,B000EGYX3A,My family's favorite Rodney Dangerfield movie.  We can actually quote his lines !  A movie of a loving father son relationship.  Great supporting cast but my favorite is when Kurt Vonnegut appears. Also enjoy Dangerfield's hilarious diving scene !  Side splitting laughs for the whole family. !,1397606400,,294,5.191489361702128

2518610,5,B000EGYX3A,These Rodney classics should not be passed over. True comedy fun that can be watched over again and it still feels like the first time. RIP Rodney. Thanks for the memories.,1360281600,,172,4.580645161290323
2518611,4,B000EGYX3A,"I have looked for ages for this film, as it is a deal good picture of forgotten times when principles meant more than money. Standards are not just an English thing, but stuborness is, and Arthur epitomises everything it means, he is a real delight to watch as he softens towards a new apprentice but remains the curmudgeon towards those who try to show him their way of doing things. I would prefer to have this on DVD but happy to have it in my collection.",1346371200,,458,4.337209302325581

8109562,3,B000EGYX3A,"I love both of these movies. Rodney is a hoot, and the stories are light, fun entertainment. The only issue I have is when part of a movie or scene is altered from the original. In ""Back to School"", the scene where Rodney is having a party in his dorm room, and one of the young ladies (Bubbles) walks over to the hot tub-- in the original movie, she was topless. In this version a bikini top was CGI'd on her. Quite annoying if you remember the original.",1524873600,,455,4.181818181818182

8109566,5,B000EGYX3A,Rodney Dangerfield is an absolute hoot in this movie. I laugh my head off every time I watch it. And I also love Joe Pesci as his best friend. Great movie! ,1509062400,,156,4.032258064516129
