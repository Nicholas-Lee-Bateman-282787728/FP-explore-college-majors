4503870,5,B004YVO5ZC,I was looking for a copy of the DVD of Silver Bullet. I purchased this product for an excellent price and got Pet Semetary included ( I don't like Grave Yard Shift). Good condition and came quickly!,1350345600,5,198,4.378378378378378

4503893,5,B004YVO5ZC,"I want the movie Pet Semetery"", I really love that movie and is story, when I saw this pack of 3 movies that are base on stephen king books I was so happy and just buy it, very nice movies :)",1423353600,,191,3.682926829268293
4503894,5,B004YVO5ZC,"I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I bought this 3 movie set specifically for Silver Bullet. I can't explain it, but I absolutely LOVE that movie. I would rank it in the top ten werewolf movies of all time. It would be top five if it had a better looking leading monster ( It looks kind of like a big black fox-bear hybrid). Sure it has the combo of Corey Haim and Gary Busey, who outside of this movie had a few questionable choices with their film projects...and a few questionable life choices in general. In this movie, however, these two are pure cheesy 80's GOLD!!! A crippled kid in a souped up motorized wheelchair, a frumpy and misunderstood older sister, and a chronically divorced and perpetually drunk uncle VS. a bloodthirsty werewolf who is using their small town as a giant open air buffet. How do you NOT love that set up??? This is easily one of the best early Stephen King film translations IMO. Then you get TWO MORE quality King movies to boot!!! Pet Semetary is FANTASTICALLY dark and sinister and has one of the most terrifying ""Creepy Horror Movie Kids"" ever. Plus you get Fred ""Herman Munster"" Gwynn in one of his last movie roles and he absolutely CRUSHES it. The guy was a consummate pro. This movie has a lot going for it. Stephen King wrote the story AND the screenplay (And was on set quite often, as the film was shot a short distance from where he lived at the time), Zombies, scary Native American folklore, a Creepy Kid with scalpel, deformed flashback sister, a kick ass theme song from punk legends The Ramones, a freaky undead cat, a terrifyingly gory ""Guardian Angel"" , great acting, awesome special FX, and amazing direction. This is a perfect Halloween movie to get you all spooked up for the night. Then there's Graveyard Shift. Okay, I'm not going to sugar coat it. It's a weird choice of short stories to make into a movie. I loved the short story from King's Night Shift collection and when I heard they were making it into a movie I was like...Why??? That said, it's not as bad as all that. It takes a while to get into proper horror movie form, but the last twenty minutes or so are really pretty solid. They managed to pull a lot out of a story about a rat infested textile mill and the disastrous attempts to exterminate said infestation. Listen, you're getting a bargain with Silver Bullet and Pet Semetary in one collection. Graveyard Shift is just an extra added bonus. Even if it's not your cup of tea, you still have those other two. I ,personally, kind of like the movie. It's not one of my favorites, but every now and then I can dust it off and watch it again and it's always entertaining. As far as three movie sets go, this is a tough one to beat. Three solid Stephen King films for a reasonable price. Horror fans should be jumping at this deal.",1412812800,3,2807,4.463035019455253

8448941,5,B004YVO5ZC,"This really is an excellent second volume to the first three disc set of films entitled When Animals Strike Back : Volume 1 . I seldom buy and/or collect motion pictures made after 1980 any longer but I made an exception here . Heck yeah I'm a Stephen King fan . These are three fun and thrilling titles to my mind . I'm preparing to watch Graveyard Shift as soon as I finish typing (only saw it theatrically before now) . If you're fond of this set of films , consider that Volume 1 has King Kong (the 1976 version) , Orca The Killer Whale (1977) with Richard Harris and Congo (1995) .",1464998400,,586,4.1946902654867255
