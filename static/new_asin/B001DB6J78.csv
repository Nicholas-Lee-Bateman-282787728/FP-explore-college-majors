So fun to see more of the great Shirley Temple. She is the original American Sweetheart and me and my family have always treasured her work. Keep 'em coming Legend Films!!",1396137600,,348,4.369230769230769

8292573,3,B001DB6J78,"Yet another delightful disc packed with two choice episodes from Shirley Temple's anthology series, SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK (aka ""The Shirley Temple Show"").  Acting as a precursor to later series like ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"", SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK was a big ratings winner for NBC.  Temple hosted and also indulged in an occasional starring role, surrounded by an amazing cast of noted Broadway and Hollywood talents.

Both of the episodes from this disc are taken from the 1960-61 season.

MADELINE (Season 2 Episode #5): Gina Gillespie brings to life the plucky heroine of Ludwig Bemelman's series of children's books.  In an old house in Paris that's covered in vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines.  The youngest one was Madeline...  Co-starring Imogene Coca as Miss Clavel, we follow Madeline and next-door neighbour Pepito (Michel Petit) as they go in search of missing dog Genevieve, but become side-tracked by the delights of a colourful gypsy circus.  Keep your eyes peeled for Ann Jillian as the oldest of the Clavel girls.

THE PRINCESS AND THE GOBLINS (Season 2 Episode #24): Shirley Temple stars as Princess Irene in this adaptation of George MacDonald's fantasy novel, about a mysterious, hidden race of goblins and the adventurous princess who, with the assistance of brave miner Curdie (Jack Ging) discovers their plot.  Co-starring Alice Pearce, Mary Wickes and Irene Hervey.

I'd love to see Legend Films expand their range of SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK discs.  For example, Shirley Temple and Fernando Lamas in ""Little Men"", Claire Bloom and Charlton Heston in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Phyllis Love in ""The Wild Swans"", Anne Helm and Olive Deering in ""Sleeping Beauty"", and Thomas Mitchell in ""The Nightingale"".",1248048000,,1788,5.279151943462898
