8342851,5,B001U4186A,"BEHIND ENEMY LINES looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underrated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.

Director Werner Herzog's RESCUE DAWN is an incredible tale of survival and the will to live. Christian Bale's performance as German-born Dieter Dengler is totally enigmatic, mesmerizing and captivating. Dengler is a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War. On a classified mission he is down over Laos and captured. Bale's performance is so aloof and curious, but is always singularly focused on escape. He may escape confinement by his captors, but the green dense jungle proves to be even more confining than can be imagined. Christian Bale's performance remains focused, but his determination is challenged time and time again. This is an interesting film based on true events. It holds your interest throughout. I love the finale even though it was criticized, but in reality its almost surrealistic and humorous feel, puts the film's entire narrative in perspective and makes it so thought provoking.

George C. Scott is PATTON. What more can be said? A lot more I suppose. I saw PATTON when it was first released. I was a senior in high school. PATTON seemed liked the culmination of so many epic WWII films. PATTON seemed like the last of that breed. The film is first rate in every department. PATTON is good filmmaking and story telling at its best. But what really drives this film is George C. Scott's inspired and driven performance. There is a certain magic element behind this film. It is absolutely absorbing and has stood the test of time. PATTON is a one of a kind film and I wonder if we will ever see the likes of it again. PATTON went on to win 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (George C. Scott), Writing (Story and Screenplay--based on factual material or material not previously published or produced), Sound, Art Direction, Film Editing and Directing (Franklin J. Schaffner).",1424476800,,2775,4.927350427350428
