8163711,1,B000LQI8E8,"DVD is taken from a grainy VHS tape. So the quality is very poor and is a distraction. When I enlarge the picture to see the steps closer, the grain gets much worse. Looks like it was reordered in the early 1970's. The instructors look like they have been stuck in the 1960's from the way they dress.

The tape is 47 minutes long. This Ballad dance is a Fox Trot/Waltz combination. If you try this dance with anyone, they will not have the slightest idea what you are doing, and think you are crazy. It is better just to learn how to do a slow Waltz, that way the follower should have an idea what you are trying to do. The Ballad dance could work if you have a regular dance partner, so you both can look at the DVD.

The instructor is boring, and slow talking. The organizations of the lesions seem unorganized. I would not buy any more of these obsolete DVD's if the Lampert's are the instructors.

Note: this same company sells the Grant Austin Collection of DVD's, and they are some of the best instructional dance DVD's on Amazon.",1245110400,2,1036,4.329896907216495
