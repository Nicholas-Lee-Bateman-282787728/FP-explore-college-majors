7896643,1,6305855471,I should have read more costumer reviews before purchasing this product. This movie is absolutely revolting. It would take a real sick individual with a really sick mind to enjoy such depravity. This film should be classified as a snuff film. There was nothing pleasing about it.,1298332800,,279,4.957446808510638

7896645,4,6305855471,"This is an almost great Franco movie.  I love the theme song and can sit and listen to it repeat itself on the menu screen over and over.  It is also used for Amber Newman's nightclub act scene right at the beginning of the movie.  I think that because of the music and lighting, etc. the nightclub scene is even better than the one Soledad Miranda does in Vampiros Lesbos.  In general, it is a very good sicko movie, but it has three main flaws.  First, there is a just plain unnecessary and frankly disgusting female urination scene.  Second, Amber Newman is a very beautiful woman as she struts on high heels or combs her hair, but she should never talk or smile.  When she does she seems like a little girl about ten years old.  Third, Franco's wife Lina Romay gets naked and she was in pretty bad shape.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate her nude work in other movies, but here she just ruins the nude scenes and I think she could have simply kept her clothes on and played the same part, almost.  The movie goes along slowly for a while and then picks up quite a bit at the end.  The ending was pretty good.  Franco is one of those moviemakers who seems to re-use many of the same ideas over and over again from movie to movie and this is no exception.  I don't know why Amber's eyes look so strange on the cover picture.  So, if you like Franco movies I think that you'll like this one.  On the other hand, if you don't know what I'm talking about when I say that, you'd probably better stay clear.",1097107200,4,1505,4.231578947368421
7896646,1,6305855471,"I think I'm ""one and done"" with supposedly legendary director Jess Franco.  I watched this movie because of its ""Most Dangerous Game""-inspired ending, and I don't want anyone else to go into this film with as little knowledge as I had about what you will see.  I knew there was ""debauchery"" in the movie, but this goes well past debauchery into the realm of true sickness.  Everything seems OK at first.  Paula is a young actress or performer of some sort who auditions for some type of less than virtuous job and soon finds herself on her way to a private island where she will ""entertain"" a number of lecherous rich folks.  At the house, they are greeted (much more than merely greeted, actually) by a strapping young woman (whom I suspect was once a man) who does not speak simply because she doesn't want to.  Okay.  The first sign of depravity comes when this woman furnishes a disgustingly personal ingredient for the evening meal.  You'll want to prepare yourself for this (or better yet, avoid it entirely by never watching this movie); I can tell you it is no fun to come up on this scene unawares.  Later, young Paula is rather viciously abused.  Finally, after several incredibly long and drawn-out scenes of no importance whatsoever, I made it up to the human prey segment and hoped for a little something positive to take away from this movie.  There was nothing at all positive about it.  To top things off, having already included just about every depravity known to man in the film, they introduce yet another hideous practice at the very end.  As I said, I knew this movie was a little extreme, but had I known just how extreme it actually was (and in what way it was extreme) I would never have watched it.
Aside from the horrible story, the acting is just awful.  Amber Newman does a good job in her unfortunate role as Paula, but the rest succeed only in being weird, distasteful, and depraved.  Lina Romay, who is obviously fairly old and extremely unappealing, was by far the worst of the bunch, and her dialogue was completely unintelligible.  She sounds like a drunken Charo trying to talk with a handful of walnuts in her mouth-I have no idea what she said at any point in the film.  I am a big fan of extreme horror, so I am unaccustomed to being sickened by a movie.  Tender Flesh sickened me, and I will avoid any and all Jess Franco movies like the plague from now on.",1045180800,10,2397,4.5092592592592595
7896647,4,6305855471,"The wild and wonderful world of Jess Franco may not be to everyone's tastes, but those even vaguely familiar with his work should check out this film at the earliest opportunity. Here, the gorgeous Amber Newman plays a young actress who must satisfy the dark desires of her potential employers in order to progress. Newman is certainly put through the hoop by her new admirers before the action moves to a remote island where Franco's twisted take on ""The Most Dangerous Game"" really kicks in.
As with many Franco films, ""Tender Flesh"" contains a few scenes that outstay their welcome but, overall, this is terrific stuff... Of course, Franco's excellent cast contribute immeasurably, blending 'old friends' (Lina Romay, Analia Ivars and Alain Petit) with new Franco babes Newman and Monique Parent to winning effect. As far as the latter two are concerned, it's great to see two American actresses successfully converted to Franco's European scheme of things.  Indeed, Amber and Monique fit in so well, it's easy to get carried away with the notion that ""Tender Flesh"" could slot into  the director's extremely productive 1980's output; it certainly wouldn't look out of place.
Extras on the disc include a stills gallery, a nice Amber video...and a 51 minute making-of documentary that is a model of it's kind and alone is worth absolutely every cent of the asking price. For a low budget production, picture quality is above average, though the sound occasionally lets the side down (Ms Romay's dialogue being unintelligible on more than one occasion). Apart from that, ""Tender Flesh"" is a real treat!",991008000,5,1604,5.049056603773585
7896648,3,6305855471,"The movie is grotesque, bizarre. If you're looking for erotism, this is not your movie.
If you like Jess Franco's films, get this DVD.
It's an excellent DVD.  Side A has the movie, the menues are very simple but nice,  and the background music is excelent.
Side B is full of extras, it has a  1 hour making of documentary, the photo shoot session with Amber Newman for  the movie promotion campaign, a gallery of pictures from the movie and 10  trailers of movies...
Ok, the  movie is full of naked women, but you won't see...or male sexual  organs, you can see a few ""bushes"" and lots of breasts. The weird  stuff is a woman urinating in a pot, a chopped head on a table ... bizarre",965433600,,683,4.322834645669292
