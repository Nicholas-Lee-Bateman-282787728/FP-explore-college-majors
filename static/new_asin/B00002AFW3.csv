7915560,2,B00002AFW3,"This show is absolutely fabulous!  The quality is absolutely wonderful too!  But there is a large logo in the corner of the screen during the entire episode of every single episode that I have watched so far.  For those of us that paid very good money for this show and were very excited to watch this, this logo has completely ruined every episode.  I would suggest removing this logo and reissuing this series.  Logos ruin tv shows and movies on  dvds and are really unfair to the customers that paid good money for them.  I understand that the company is trying to ward against pirating, but, as I stated before, this is really unforgivable and very unfair to those of us that have paid for these.  Big big mistake with this logo! It ruined this entire show on dvd!",1365465600,9,768,4.474820143884892

7915562,5,B00002AFW3,"Another great set from Nostalgia Merchant.  The quality of this set is not digital by any means, but is very decent.  I gave this set 5 stars because the quality is good, and the set contains almost the complete series.

I remember watching this show when I was still in grammer school and am thrilled this set has been released.  This is classic tv at its best.",1252022400,10,362,4.358208955223881
7915563,5,B00002AFW3,"This VHS video is one of the hardest to get because they run out of stock so fast.  Interesting too is this is the 13th film in the BLONDIE series.  Blondie (Penny Singleton) is trying to get Cookie (Majorie Ann Mutchie) to eat her breakfast.  Alexander (Larry Simms) and Alvin (Danny Mummert) is getting in to mischief by selling 10 cents a wham.  When Alexander and Alvin were washing the windows outside, Dagwood (Arthur Lake) thought it was raining outside.  Guess what Dagwood brings home?  Reggie the Horse.  Watch Daisy try to hide the horse from Blondie.  Majorie Ann Mutchie (age 3), later known as Majorie Kent, begins her role as ""Cookie"" which she played until the last film in 1950.
  This is Mary Jane Carey's last appearance as ""Mary Reynolds""--The Switchboard Operator.
  The next film in the series is FOOTLIGHT GLAMOUR (1943).",1064448000,4,844,4.825174825174825
7915564,4,B00002AFW3,"I'm a teacher in a bilingual Montessori classroom, grades one through three.  Our school motto is ""Respect Yourself, Respect Others and Respect the Environment"" and this video is perfect for teaching that concept.  I feel very strongly that kids should learn that animals deserve respect and this video challenges them to think about ways in which we as a society use animals; many of those uses can't be described as ""respectful"" and are no longer necessary.  This is a good video for provoking deeper thought and discussion about animal rights issues.  Unlike some of the older ""humane education"" films, this video is fast-moving and keeps their attention; the narrators appeal to kids' sense of what is ""cool"" (kindness and respect!) and avoid a lecturing tone.  My students choose it again and again when they have free video time.  Jan Herzog, Wichita Falls, Texas",978998400,14,869,5.041958041958042
7915565,5,B00002AFW3,"Population and People of Faith, Its About Time does and exceptional job at the arduous task of presenting unbiased information about overpopulation to the Christian audience.  The Institute for Development Training has created a video that breaks out of the stereotypes  of Christian thought on overpopulation and delves down to what the Bible  says about this issue.  Before this video, I considered overpopulation to  be an issue that was of no special concern to Christians.  From this video  I understand just how vital population issues are to Christian beliefs. I  would highly recommend this video and study guide for individuals,  churches, study groups, and organizations who deal with, or are interested  in, overpopulation and Christian issues.",957916800,,755,5.431034482758621
