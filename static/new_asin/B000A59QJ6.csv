2362603,2,B000A59QJ6,"It's hard to take bad reviews seriously when everyone else says a film is great, especially a restored silent by a big name director. But hear me out...

I rented this based on the gushing reviews it's gotten and because I'm a big fan of silent films; but it's not just because of the production design. There's also the storytelling element, and in this regard, The Blue Bird, frankly, sucks.

Haven't heard of the story before? That's because this film is based on a very didactic 19th century play for children that has NOT withstood the test of time. It's sort of amusing at first, watching the characters of The Soul of Bread and The Soul of Water come to life in interpretive dance... sort of.. but then come the characters, one by one, like a long lecture, with names like ""Can eat when not hungry"". And the punch line, in an hour plus, is the old Gilded Age saw: Be grateful for what you have, and don't strive for more.

The images are nice at times, but not any better or worse than any other big budget fantasy of the period (and nowhere near as inventive as the great stuff from Lang, Murnau, Chaney, Fairbanks, etc.)

And finally, the newly recorded music is bland as a rainy day,

The experience of this film was like being stuck in one of those historic landmarks of a one room schoolhouse, except that instead of looking around for a moment and leaving, you have to sit stock still and listen to a real school marm give you an hour long ""children's"" lecture, with one hand on the ruler in case you get restless.",1126742400,25,1527,4.419928825622776
2362604,5,B000A59QJ6,"I had no idea what to expect from ""The Blue Bird"" at first, but knew I would like it simply because it was directed by Maurice Tourneur, whose prior studies in Art back in France gave his films a beautiful and special artistic quality, and placed him as an important director in the early pioneering days of cinema.  The few Tourneur films I had seen already, however, did not prepare me for the exquisite charm and delight of ""The Blue Bird"", and the more I watched this film, the more I was impressed.  There are two main aspects that struck me most:  firstly, ""The Blue Bird"" is visually beautiful and delightful, with attention to photography, lighting and not in the least some special effects and sets that give the entire film a fairytale feeling.  Far from being a mere children's fairytale, however, the second impressive aspect of this film is the depth of spiritual meaning in the story itself, which was originally written by Maurice Maeterlinck and made into a successful play in 1910.  The blue bird symbolizes happiness, and two children go on a quest in a magical dream adventure to find this elusive bird.  With the aid of a fairy and some magic, the children are able to see the invisible world:  the soul or spirit of everyday things like water, bread and fire, as well as seeing the inner spirit of their pet dog and cat, their mother, and souls of children who have died and are yet to be born.  They are also shown the luxuries, such as `eating when not hungry and drinking when not thirsty', and by the end of their journey the children learn how to recognize and value the things around them, and the moral of the story is that happiness is first to be found right near you - not in the chasing of faraway, elusive dreams.

The bonus material on this DVD has extensive excerpts from the 1910 play for anyone who'd like to compare and go further in-depth, as well as an easy-to-read biography and filmography of Maurice Tourneur.  Several scenes in ""The Blue Bird"" reminded me of ""The Wizard of Oz"", such as when bread and sugar, as well as the dog and cat take on human form and accompany the children on their dream-like journey.  Everything is even more impressive when you keep in mind that this film was made in 1918, and features a high standard of production, including beautiful, artistic intertitle cards.  Although there are several minutes here and there when the film shows some damage and deterioration, the overall excellent production, enhanced by a beautiful, calming classical music score, easily outweighs this flaw, and together with its deeply meaningful and inspirational theme, I think it well deserves 5 stars and an important place in a silent film collection.",1126656000,21,2707,4.687763713080169
2362605,4,B000A59QJ6,"If you mention the name Tourneur (tour-NURR) to most film aficianados they will say Jacques Tourneur (1904-1977) the director of the film noir classic OUT OF THE PAST and several Val Lewton horror films such as CAT PEOPLE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE. But before Jacques there was his father Maurice Tourneur (1873-1961) who was one of the major directors of the silent era. He came to the U.S. in 1912 and made a number of major films until 1926 when studio interference drove him back to France where his career continued but was never quite the same. Until recently he was long overshadowed by his son because so many of his films were unavailable. Now that is being rectified with the release in the last few years of many of his silent classics (see VICTORY, THE WISHING RING, and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS).

Two brand new releases are LORNA DOONE and this first and best version of Maurice Maeterlinck's allegorical play THE BLUE BIRD. Tourneur was one of the great visual stylists of the silent era and nowhere is that more apparent than here. The film is a combination of realistic and deliberately stylised elements that draw on Tourneur's former theatrical background. This mixing of styles confused audiences of 1918 and the film, though critically praised, was not a success. Even today it takes some getting used to but if you make the effort THE BLUE BIRD has its share of rewards.

The print used for this DVD comes from the George Eastman House and is a restored version of an old VHS version released through Grapevine Video. It too features the original 1918 color tints and is in much better shape though parts of the film still retain some damage but not enough to ruin the viewing experience especially for silent film enthusiasts. The new score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is well performed and has a great deal of charm, but I would have preferred something a little more ethereal during the fantasy scenes to enhance the unreal quality.

For those of you who don't know the story, it follows the efforts of two children to find the blue bird of happiness by going on a journey into the past and future. They are accompanied by the living souls of their pets and ordinary household objects. After many adventures in fantastic locales, they discover that it was at home all along (sound familiar?). Unlike THE WIZARD OF OZ there are philosophical and theosophical points to be made along the way. After all this was a major work by one of the most popular writers of the pre-World War I era. One of the special DVD features includes written excerpts of the original play for you to check out.

Although remade twice (1940 with Shirley Temple and in 1976 in a fabled Russian-American disaster directed by George Cukor), this version remains the closest to Maeterlinck's intentions. That coupled with Maurice Tourneur's imaginative touches and delicate direction make this a classic that's great to have back in circulation. If you prefer reality to fantasy check out Tourneur's just released LORNA DOONE. It is one of the great historical romance films of any era.",1126656000,15,3097,4.75092936802974

8074753,5,B000A59QJ6,"In 2 more years, this remarkable silent film will be 100 years old ... and while times have changed so much since then (not necessarily for the better in all ways), it remains an enchanting, dreamlike for viewers who can turn the magic diamond & see its soul with clear vision. It's a fascinating mixture of early film & stylized theatrics, creating an ethereal world that's more of an inner, emotional & moral landscape through which the characters travel, searching for the elusive Bluebird of Happiness. Yes, the final moral of the story is quite obvious -- but no less true for all that, and one worth heeding in an age of conspicuous consumption.

But let's be honest -- for many contemporary viewers, this will be something of a slog. Some simply won't want to watch a silent film, or a film made before they were born, or a film with (to them) primitive special effects. Sadly, with so much of film history available to all these days, many viewers have increasingly narrowed their focus & miss out on treasures such as this one. But it's their loss. To see a film that celebrates beauty, wonder, and compassion -- all without a slick, glib, modernist gloss -- is a gift.

And yes, the image quality suffers where some of the film has deteriorated; and yes, it's not for every taste. Even so, it has much to offer, some of it quite surprising -- it's quite comfortable with discreet nudity, for instance, used in a strictly artistic sense -- as shown by the children of Mother Night. And some aspects anticipate 1939's ""The Wizard of Ox"" -- the faithful Dog is very reminiscent of the Cowardly Lion -- while the Cat is a marvel of sly, self-serving sneakiness. The symbolic souls of Fire, Water, Milk, and so forth are both beautiful & comical, depending on the figures. Even the then-popular sentimentality of so many turn-of-the-century stories is somehow charming here.

Again, this will always be something of a niche film. As with many Symbolist works, it's a clear predecessor of Surrealism -- for that aspect alone, it's well worth watching. But it also offers an almost archetypal vision of purity & idealism that we all long for at some point in our lives -- and for that reason, it remains more timely than you might think. For those who can indeed turn the diamond & see, highly recommended!",1450051200,,2309,4.6683046683046685
8074754,3,B000A59QJ6,"I feel the premise /moral of the movie was overshadowed by the blandness of the theatrics, its less than alluring black and white format and some breaks in the viewing.

8074757,5,B000A59QJ6,"wow. whatta trip. always liked 'The Bluebird', but i'd have to say the original is a lot stranger and less normative than it's more easy going remakes. i mean some of this was a little hard to take, but usually silent cinema fantasies are. the silent cinema versions of 'OZ' are a lot kookier than the 1938 MGM version with Judy Garland. and that's saying a lot since the old MGM classic probably deserves more of a reputation as a oddity than anything else.
 i've always loved the 'Bluebird' since youth because of it's simple sweetness. i'd have to say if i saw this as a young child i'd think it was too weird and scary. even viewing this silent version for the first time as a adult, i'd have to say much of the charm and appeal was a little lost on me. i just couldn't get over so much of the creepiness. but it did have some charm. and the kids were kind of cute once you got used to all that silent movie, caked on facial make up. and the fairy had trippy butterfly wings.
 mostly this movie gives me the spookies. but it was very ""otherwordly"" and offbeat. even for the silent era when most films were unitentionally odd. and Touner's direction was eerie and haunting. this version is mostly for the archives and for adults. most of the ""younger generation"" and kids will probably just think it outdated, creepy and scary. but serious cinema fans will enjoy it.
  note: too bad the original prints of this classic are lost or badly damaged. a reminder that ALL film and television should be perserved for archival purposes. it should not be left to personal opinion or pick and choose mentality. one person's garbage is another person's unforgettable experience and whatever, they always tell us something of the time period. but kudos to the woderful and inspiring KINO distribution for doing a first class job of bringing us the finest print possible of rare and neglected film masterpieces.",1330128000,2,1901,4.58235294117647

Directed by the great Maurice Tourneur, it pleases on every level.  No big name stars here, which makes it all the more enjoyable.  The visuals are stunning,a hallmark of Tourneur's work.  The print, while showing signs of decomposition in some spots, is quite good.  It is a simple story told simply and all the more amazing for having been made in 1918, before Hollywood began dominating the film world in the 1920s.  Highly recommended for all film lovers, not just silent film buffs.",1315180800,,727,6.009708737864078
8074759,2,B000A59QJ6,"Tourneur was a director of great visual imagination--but how do you show this in a film that has chemical decomposition and even blistering running down its center through roughly half its length?  Add to that several lengthy missing scenes in the middle, and a few missing shorter sequences elsewhere, and you've got a problem getting the essence of the man's vision across to even veteran archival film lovers who can accept a good quality print of Griffith.  I enjoyed it, but I was willing to work through all the screen garbage to see some of the beauty that was buried, there.  My wife just rubbed her eyes.

So kudos to the Eastman folks for holding this print, and making it available, and to the music team for creating such a sympathetic score.  But nobody restored this work, and Kino took its usual cheap way out of extras by simply printing on screen a laudatory review from the original film's opening, and a couple of acts from the original play.  Not a commentary in sight, or bios of the director, or actors, or listing of Tourneur's films.

So cavaet emptor: consider The Blue Bird for purchase only if you don't mind owning a heavily damaged, somewhat incomplete version of the film, in the likelihood no one will do for it what has been done for many other films of its vintage.  I'm hoping this version will be superceded in the near future.",1243468800,16,1362,4.622406639004149
8074760,2,B000A59QJ6,"You may have noticed that word of this silent film HASN'T come down thru the generations extolling it as a classic not to be missed. That omission seems to be well deserved.

I found this to be a ponderous movie. It took almost a half hour to start on its journey to find the Blue Bird of Happiness. That time was spent in a claustrophobic room in a peasant's cottage introducing characters who would accompany the young boy and girl on their journey. Accompany. Most of them barely participated.

When the journey finally starts, it begins promisingly. Before long I realized that they were just going to visit various palaces (eg, the Palace of the Night) which were supposed to be magical. And, a graveyard for reasons that you should discover yourself.

The fault appears to be the other Maurice -- Maurice Maeterlinck -- who wrote the play this movie was based on. Maeterlinck evidently lacked the lofty imagination required to make this fantasy take flight. Too many discoveries felt flat. Then, things got worse. It turned preachy (messages that many people echo today -- but not me).

As a final disappointment, there really wasn't a dramatic resolution to the story. It's ending will remind you of a couple other movies. And this film suffers in comparison since those films were so much better.

As for Maurice Tourneur's contribution, there are only a few visual treats. He relied too much on primative camera tricks to entertain the audience.

My stingy rating doesn't even take into account the severe deterioration suffered by the film master. This film is about 90 years old, after all. And age hasn't improved it.",1187395200,6,1629,4.841726618705036
