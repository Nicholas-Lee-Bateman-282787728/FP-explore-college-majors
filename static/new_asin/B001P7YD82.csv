3740483,5,B001P7YD82,"Love this -- if you like your entertainment cutting edge, this will keep you mesmerized.

My only question is -- Skins III has been out in Britain for MONTHS? Why are you torturing us poor Americans by not letting us buy Season 3 on DVD, Amazon, iTunes, whatever?

WE WANT OUR SKINS 3!",1247184000,,285,4.3584905660377355
3740484,4,B001P7YD82,"Skins  Series 2 picks up from a cliffhanger that reached almost ""Dallas"" heights of drama in the first series.  That cliffhanger - Tony being hit by a bus - is resolved in these episodes but the resolution is not solved after only one episode.  Instead, we follow the consequences of that incident through the course of the next ten episodes.

Did we think everything was going to be happy for Sid and Cassie after the first series finale?  Guess again.  Sid makes some surprising choices and Cassie finds herself going down an even darker path than before when she wasn't eating. (Yes, it is possible.)

Other characters face new dilemmas and not all of them end up happily for all involved but that's the beauty of ""Skins.""  We find that we end up caring enough about these characters to be deeply affected by whatever befalls them.  And some serious stuff goes down in series 2.

My only real complaint was the ""Tony"" episode when he explores a potential university.  I feel that it's the weakest episode of either season 1 or 2 but other than that, this is a stellar season.  It's too bad that the cast was replaced for Season Three but now we get a whole new crop of kids to meet.",1245801600,3,1185,4.485981308411215
3740485,3,B001P7YD82,"Goofily over the top, this British drama makes Gossip Girl look staid in comparison thanks to hyperactive plot twists that even daytime soaps might blush at. It's saved somewhat by a very appealing cast, led by Nicholas Hoult as Tony, a cad turned vegetable (bus accident, don't you know), Hannah Murray as the nutter Cassie, and Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire as the cool, tired of tradition Muslim teenager Anwar.

i loved maxxie/james getting together. stalking story line was scary but realistic. dev patel was subdued, but everyone did a great job.  not sure how series 3 is going to play without tony.  again, a great group of young actors who shoud be very proud of their work.",1240790400,,415,4.671232876712328
3740487,5,B001P7YD82,"Well, you all know how things left off at the end of the last series. Tony got hit by a bus, Sid and Cassie met at a bench, Maxxie and Anwar made up and everyone had a nice little singing number (?!).

Now we pick up some months later with a whole series of interesting story lines! We follow Tony on his slow road to recovery (apparently getting slammed into by a bus is not something one gets over right away). We see him and Maxxie getting closer even as Sid and Michelle turn slowly away from Tony. We also get to see Maxxie pick up a stalker, which is all sorts of fun.

Moving on, we have a lovely love triangle developing between Sid, Michelle and Tony (who I've always thought really wanted to have a three-way relationship with Sid and Michelle), Jal and Chris start hooking up (I still think she could do better), Cassie disolves and becomes even more mad than before, and Anwar, well... Anwar starts thinking with the wrong part of his body and does wrong by Maxxie. Even Effie starts to get more attention, which makes sense given her expanded role in series three. All of this builds to an astonishing and rather tear-jerking climax that one doesn't soon forget.

As in the first series, the writting in the second is sharp and intelligent. The actors are all in top form, particularly Nicholas Hoult, who has a real challenge playing a damaged version of Tony (well, more damaged than usual). There's also some incredibly funny dialogue and some great scenes.

I really enjoyed one scene with Maxxie's father and the father of a bully/gay basher, talking with each other. These are men who look like your basic longshoremen, yet neither has a problem with Maxxie being gay. Heck, the father of the bully even says the boy has baked a ""remorse cake"" and offers Maxxie the cake which says, ""Sory"" on it. I just about fell out of my chair laughing at that scene, but in addition to comedy one must note the positive message it gives gay youth.

Really, I can't think of any real flaws the show has, aside from the fact that none of the cast save Effie will be returning for series three. I do rather hope there's a few more extras on these DVD's as opposed to those from series one, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.

Anyhow, if you liked series one, buy this! If you haven't seen series one, go buy that and THEN buy this! If you have seen series one, but didn't like it, then... er... why are you even looking at this page? ;) To the rest of you, enjoy!",1234828800,20,2472,4.374727668845316

3740514,5,B001P7YD82,"This season, some of the characters are working for a future, while others are just fighting to live. Love and Death in this series really puts them into perspective, while still being funny. It really shows how f'd up love and death can make someone react in all kinds of different ways.

My favorite part is Tony's sister Effy. I have already seen seasons 3, 4, so I know how big a role she plays in the future. She started off like a big mystery, we always would see her sneaking off in season 1, until one episode followed her through her worst night, where she almost died. Season 2 Effy is taking care of her mom and brother, while her dad is away on business. She enrolls in a private school, and the teacher tasks Effy with showing the new girl 'Pandora Moon' around. Panda is also a huge part of the next two seasons as well. It's nice to already know a couple of characters, while the next season becomes a mostly new cast.

If you are no fan of Effy though, Season 2 is a good stopping place in the series, as most of the characters are moving on at the end. If you are intrigued by Effy like I am, then defiantly order seasons 3 and 4. -Season 7 also returns with a lot of the seasons 3 and 4 cast, but is not available region 1 at this time, but i will defiantly snag that whenever its available.",1396915200,2,1309,4.169960474308301
3740515,4,B001P7YD82,I am unhappy with the fact there were some scuffs and a couple dents on the DVD cover/case. The front of the case. But could have been done through mailing not to big of a deal but I would of been a lot happier with perfect condition.

Like anything the Brits put out, this is raw, edgy and about as real as it gets.
Look for the episode where featuring the entire cast singing- and using their own voices- to Cat Stevens WILD WORLD. One of my Favs!",1368662400,,393,3.925

3740535,5,B001P7YD82,"This show is absolutely amazing with well written character development, each character has there thing that makes them tick. For Tony, being a bit of a prick, Anwar, chasing girls, Chris, drugs of course, Jal, her impending future. Everything about this show is great to the soundtrack, the humor, to the drama. I don't think I've seen better acting from US actors as I've seen with the cast of ""Skins"". Both seasons one and two are uncannily great, with the first season the kids living to get away, to the second, graduating college and wondering ""What will I do?"".

  Trust me this series is particularly something special to me. If you like a mixture of great drama, comedy, and wanting to live your youth again, watch this show.",1281398400,3,734,4.71875

3740540,5,B001P7YD82,"`Skins' is a comedy-drama that follows the adventures and misadventures of a group of community college students.
I classify `Skins' for mature audiences. A mature teen will enjoy the programs. Caution, there is adult language, drug use, and there are sexual situations.  Also `Skins' is not a morality play - `bad' behavior does not necessarily have consequences outside the group of `Skins' characters.
The acting is wonderful, as good as entertainment gets.
Outstanding performances: Hannah Murray, playing `Cassie'. Joe Dempsie, playing `Chris'. I hated coming to the end of the second season, because it was so sad.
I cannot try to rank the characters. The performances of all are extraordinary.
My favorite character was `Cassie'...
You will laugh and cry at `Skins'. I recommend it very highly.",1256860800,,801,5.307086614173229
3740541,4,B001P7YD82,"At the end of series one we have the core crew pretty much all having major cataclysms in their life. Whether it's the concept of facing life alone, descending into a drug induced stupor or being hit by a bus, really only Maxie and Anwar have any stability or happiness going on. As I noted in my review of series one, it was the collective strength of the group that kept them all together - in as much as they were. And at the centre of the group, the axle around which many of the interpersonal relationships revolved, was Tony. Charming and caclulating in equal measure he provided a lot of the glue that kept the group together.

Well in series two of this British series concentrating on the lives of teenagers from the city of Bristol Tony is out of action. Who would of thought that being hit by a bus at the end of series one would of been a problem? With Tony out of sorts and unable to manipulate the group, which at least gave them direction, the different personalities are left to stumble along on their own as they face a growing pile of consequences from their teenage indiscretions. But being Skins they don't actually move to fix anything, rather they seem to drive headlong into more flippantly self destructive modes of operation. The madcap adventures played out here are aided by the tight writing and they way that the show does not treat the concerns of these teenagers with a knowing wink, the show portrays them in all their idiocy without making excuses but it also never stoops to being condescending towards young people and that is one of the reasons why the gritty aspects are able to co-exist with the outrageous segments.

This second instalment of Skins is probably less satisfying. This was a brave move by the writers as making their characters more likeable in order to make some serious bank must of been tempting. But no, Cassie becomes even more mentally ill and nasty. Sid bumbles to the point where you want to punch him and is actively annoying (and one of the reasons why this series isn't five stars - sorry, but nobody is that moronic). Tony learns a lot and not all the lessons are much fun for him. And one of the major characters doesn't make it to the end alive in one of the most gut wrenching scenes of either series thus far.

The kids are alright? Not this lot, very damaged people and yes it's true that such a broken crew wouldn't coalesce like this in real life and yes, the plot lines are ridiculously far fetched, but much of this is compelling viewing if you have the stomach for the material. For example, I told think Ned Flanders would approve.",1254528000,,2607,4.4957805907173

I suggest getting Volume 1 first cause this Volume 2 carries the story of this ELITE CAST further down the road. Helps a lot being familiar with all the cast members.

Hard to put it simply, it is a very fun show to watch. Certainly worth looking over again. This is a powerful show with lots of depth.

Series 5 and 6 are pathetic. I'm surprised to say that I mostly loved Fire, but two things in particular really irritated me. Pure is dull and Rise kind of worked for me when I stopped thinking of it as a Skins-related.",1424304000,,391,4.157894736842105
