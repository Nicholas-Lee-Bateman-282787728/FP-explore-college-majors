2449844,3,B000BZ5NW4,"I only recommend this for people with good attention spans. While the teacher is an accomplished pianist with lots of information to offer, he's not very effective at keeping your interest for long periods of time. If you're looking for an upbeat, exciting DVD that will entertain you while its teaching you, don't look here.",1220400000,4,325,4.927272727272728
2449845,1,B000BZ5NW4,"This guy might be a great musician, but as a teacher, well... Even though I'm very interested in learning piano, I tried not to fall asleep during his long and boring speech... but I couldn't.
Try it if you're pacient, I couldn't.",1219968000,7,230,4.5
2449846,5,B000BZ5NW4,"This is the best of DVD's available on this subject,  best instructional and best value and I've tried most of them.  Pete Sears takes a mature beginners approach to learning...refreshing not to hear 'Go tell Aunt Nancy' and 'Ode to Joy', which is why I gave up on the piano years ago.  Now with an insight into note intervals and chord structures and Pete Sears' obvious passion for the instrument I'm motivated.  If you don't wish to play piano its still worth the price for the musical insights the humour and Mr Sears irony.  Would like him to make a follow-up aimed at the more advance player and also publish accompanying Book/CD set.",1208131200,7,640,4.628318584070796
2449847,5,B000BZ5NW4,"The dvd is a joy to watch and listen to. Mr. Sears is going to give you  musical concepts that you will have to practice with and develop to create your own personal expressions. The tools he gives are the ones that artists who play ""by ear"" use. Mr. Sears love for music and the joy he feels as he expresses himself on the piano and his desire to share his path with us comes warmly through. The emphasis is on the blues. You will not learn individual songs here, but rather the ideas that go into blues and improvisational playing. This DVD is just a starting point. But a good one.",1174435200,19,584,4.214285714285714
2449848,5,B000BZ5NW4,"I am brand new player, This DVD is right on target. It covers everything from Half steps, to chords to reading music. I can't understand someone saying this isn't for beginners. He even tells you what kind of CHair to buy. If you are going to spend money, this is the best money to spend. Granted he does jump around, and some of it might seem confusing. Watch the whole DVD and you will understand. If you are looking for music theory and learning for real look here, if you are looking for mary has a little lamb, or twinkle twinkle look else where. I rented almost all the DVDs out there on this subject, and this one is the best hands down so far. About 10 times more useful information on it, and I can't believe the DVD is only 17$.",1171411200,41,738,4.204225352112676
2449849,4,B000BZ5NW4,"Like the other reviewers, I am a beginning adult piano student. And like most of us, I'm going through a plethora of books and DVDs to find the ""right"" one. Pete Sears' DVD comes pretty darn close. He has a very conversational style that would almost make you think he's a little ""spacey"", but that is far from the case. He provides a very solid (and I believe) very classical approach to piano instruction. However, the DVD is a long lecture - not sub-divided into specific topics. I found it very cumbersome to go back to a paritcular point. I strongly suggest that you go to his website and download the script to the DVD (I use the script as a textbook when I'm practicing his exercises). Its all there and its a ""must"" if you really want to get the most out of his very good approach to piano instruction.",1163894400,79,810,4.370860927152318
2449850,2,B000BZ5NW4,I bought this DVD hoping to learn how to play chords on piano or keyboard.  With three years of piano lessons I was able to kind of follow the instructor.  It's definitely not for beginner.  I learned some new music theory.  Each topic would be better if the instructor includes  familiar songs to demonstrate or examplify.  Overall I would not recommend this to eager learner or those who are looking for introductory or systematic instructions to learning piano or keyboard.,1160611200,31,476,4.8875
2449851,5,B000BZ5NW4,"I am indebted to Mr. Sears for sharing his expertise in this DVD.  It represents three hours of very well presented instructional material.  His presentation style is a delight, and it is joy to a count this top professional among my teachers.  I've reviewed a large number of piano instructional DVD's and this one stands out as my all time favorite.  It is also very reasonably priced.  If you are a beginner expect to review this DVD more than once.

His ending dialog on music appreciation is in itself almost worth the price of the DVD.

Again, thank you Mr. Sears.  I hope you will one day do another.

2449852,5,B000BZ5NW4,"It is very nice DVD course of piano, very logical and very practical. It explain things very well, the musical theory, the way how to play and so on.

2449855,4,B000BZ5NW4,"There are a lot of piano-instruction DVDs out there, but this one is exceptional. I would give it 5 stars, except that I am still working on it. The approach is unusual which, I think, gives it unusual value. You come away with renewed confidence that you can master any number of keys rather than simply being good at a few. The exercises seem very valuable. At the price I would recommend this to any adult, beginner or experienced. For the beginner or re-entering adult pianist it is excellent and is probably useful for those already playing for some time. Since I'm an adult I can't say whether this approach would be as good for the pre-pubescent crowd, but for adults it's great.",1442620800,5,686,4.585365853658536

2449885,1,B000BZ5NW4,"Pete Sears is a talented musician, but he absolutely sucks big time as an instructor. I had taken formal piano lessons, but I hadn't played in quite awhile. So I was looking for a refresher, a back-to-the-basics kind of DVD. I thought Mr. Sears' DVD was going to be the one since the title led me to believe that it was for beginners. This DVD isn't for beginners. Plus he goes too fast. You'll definitely need the e-book. He spends way too much time playing the piano instead of teaching. Also, there are times when his hat obstructs the view of the keys he's playing because he's leaning over the keyboard. I could've done just fine thank you very much without his digressions and at times gibberish. I found his dry sense of humor at times funny, but I must agree with some of the other reviewers that overall he's boring. It took me 2 days to watch the entire DVD because I kept falling asleep. If you want a true beginner's piano DVD, look elsewhere. If you suffer from insomnia and looking for a cure, then this DVD is for you.",1305244800,14,1033,4.385416666666667
2449886,2,B000BZ5NW4,"This DVD is definitely not for beginners.  It is an intermediate level piano course.  You are not taught basics such as how to read notes or which piano keys are which.  After a bunch of introductory remarks the instructor goes right into concepts such as chords and scales.  He covers too much material in this 3 hour DVD, but does it too fast and doesn't give you time to absorb it.  On the positive side you are shown graphics of which keys to strike, which is better than the Play Piano Today video by Hal Leonard, which covers up the keys with the instructors hands so that you can't see what keys are being played.  You can get some concept of what topics are covered by the following chapter index of the DVD:  Introduction, posture, first exercise, notes and octaves, introduction to scales, keyboard fingering, natural minor scale, harmonic minor scale, blues scale chords, blues progression, chord variations, chord and scale patterns, grace notes, walking bass notes, more chord variations, note values, chordal relationships, modes, relative minors, minor pentatonic scale, playing with a band.",1294876800,9,1106,4.978260869565218
2449887,5,B000BZ5NW4,"This is an awesome DVD. I am in my 60's and without any musical back ground, but even people now playing gigs could learn from this DVD. Pete tore down the walls of music theory and made it alive and exciting. He removes the mystery of improvisation in the first ten minutes. I checked out this DVD from the local library and didn't want to take it back, so I bought it. Every time I watch Pete I learn something new.",1273190400,6,417,4.160493827160494
2449888,5,B000BZ5NW4,"Yes, the audio could be better, yes, the video quality is not A++, yes, Pete wanders at time and yes, you need to download his pdf file. BUT, this is a rare opportunity to sit beside a fine musician and an inquisitive mind!  Mr. Sears is obviously not a music teacher, he's a music maker and that's what he's attempting to instill in the viewer. He provided a basic skeleton or structure with the chords, scales, modes, etc., and then he shows you HOW TO MAKE MUSIC! You have to know three things: 1) what to do, 2) how to do it, and then 3) do it. Pete gives you the first two, the third is up to you.

I loved his expression, ""let the music breathe"". Make the music your own, don't copy him or anyone else he admonishes. As the Chinese say, "".... teach a man to fish and he'll feed himself for life."" I think he does an admirable job all things given.",1251936000,15,853,4.132530120481928
2449889,1,B000BZ5NW4,"Pete Sears is a good piano player, he is not a good piano teacher.  I already play guitar, and I wanted to learn about the piano keyboard(as per his title) like I learned the guitar fretboard.  His delivery is slow and boring, he spends too much time playing piano rather than teaching piano.  I went through only about 1/4th his lesson from the start and quit because I lost interest for the reasons stated above.

I don't feel like Amazon owes me a refund, but if I had purchased directly from Pete, I would ask him for a refund.  HRE",1239321600,10,536,4.32
2449890,5,B000BZ5NW4,this is a great video to help learn to play the piano/keyboard. The guy teaching is laid back and makes it fun to learn. Worth the money,1233792000,2,136,4.074074074074074
2449891,5,B000BZ5NW4,"Do not underestimate the value of these lessons! Rock icon Pete Sears has generously created an inexpensive all inclusive package (DVD and online book) on how to improvise jazz blues and play like him and his contemporaries: e.g., Elton John, Ian Stewart (Stones), Nicky Hopkins (Stones), Ian McLagan (Rod Stewart), Ian Armitt (Long John Baldry).

Instruction is purportedly for beginners or intermediate players, but it's for anyone who wants to get confident and proficient at piano improvisation. Simple blues exercises encourage improv right away, something I haven't always found with lessons, where the student must go through rote scales and arpeggios ad nauseam before getting to anything that sounds like music. Scales are important, but fun, feeling and listening are also necessary.

The beauty of the instruction is the stressed importance of learning chords and exercises in as many keys as you can and noting the spatial relationships that allow for quick key transposition. Pete also encourages playing around with building chords in as many variations possible whenever you can. This promotes quick, creative thinking when improvising, rather than getting stuck in root positions and triads, like I had a problem with.

I'm a fairly solid player but can't always pick out the construction of fast licks on recordings.  Here, Pete tells you what he's doing, then performs the concept where his playing can be viewed through a camera angle above. Because it's a DVD: if something confuses, you can watch it again.

Chord inversions and jazz voicings comprise rich arrangements. Scales and modes over chord progressions create a variety of moods.  Everything but the time and hard work is in this package. You'll become great if you keep at it and follow Pete's thoughtful instruction.",1228694400,16,1798,5.269230769230769
2449892,5,B000BZ5NW4,"The title of this DVD is a little misleading - while it does teach you ""how to play the piano"" and it covers all the rudiments that are necessary for a foundation of piano playing, in my opinion the real value comes ""between the lines"". The real gems are watching a well-rounded musician playing blues riffs with ease close up while explaining what is happening.

The DVD covers the basics well and you'll need to know your 7ths, blues progressions etc if you want to play pop/rock piano. It covers the elements necessary for rock, pop and classical, i.e. scales chords and melody.

Pete puts his own spin on piano lessons, especially when he says ""play this chord and just listen to it for a minute"". One sometimes forgets that listening is an important part of playing and putting a melody together with chords creates music. Pete is a bit soft spoken at time and a review of the chapter helps in revealing more than a superficial run through does.

Pete Sears is a true rocker ( in the best sense of the phrase, a little ""insane"" as he puts it, a little mystical, a little spacey perhaps but always right on with the instruction. Well worth the money and time to invest into it! Rock on Pete!",1226361600,9,1195,4.472477064220183
2449893,5,B000BZ5NW4,"As I was looking around for a proper method to learn the piano, I stumbled across the Pete Sears method. I was aware of the bands that he has played in but when I got this, I realized how truly an amazing player he actually is.

I've seen some a few other piano DVD's where the instructor gives you a ""robotic"" factual note-by-note lesson of where things are and how they should be.

But Pete interjects his own life lessons into this DVD. And due to his many years in the business, you would assume he has played in just about every live and studio situation imaginable.

The lessons themselves are clearly illustrated on the screen with graphics of the keyboard as well as an overhead view of Pete's fingers walking you through each lesson.

I wouldn't honestly say this DVD is for children whose parents want something for their kids first piano lesson.  But if you are seriously looking to learn how to play the piano, this one if for you.",1224547200,8,943,4.459302325581396
