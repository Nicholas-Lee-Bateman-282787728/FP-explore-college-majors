4599808,5,B0058M07US,"I would say that I am pretty fit...I work out about 4-5 days a week. I wanted to switch up my routine a little bit and add more cardio. Im also tired of hitting the gym and doing the same classes day after day. So I decided to get back into my DVD kick. I am a HUGE Jillian Michaels fan...I love all her work outs. I have also done P90X...but I Hated listening to his voice day after day. I saw this on collage video and thought the preview looked interesting. I wanted to add some different cardio DVDs to my routine...I like to have fun...but also work out HARD. So I ordered it and I LOVED IT!!! I was drenched in sweat after I finished it. I did have to rest a few times the first time through. I have never done a Billy Blanks work out...but I love it!!! He is also very entertaining through out the video...he says little jokes and is tough on the girls. He is also a HORRIBLE actor..which also keeps me entertained...

If you like working hard...but get tired of the same old High Knees, But Kicks, jumping Jacks,elliptical machine,zumba, etc then you should definitely buy this DVD.

I'm going to get his SOS DVD also, because I tone alot through out the week (with Jillian)...so a all cardio DVD would be great for me!!!

I'm also looking to drop 15lbs by the new year...I'm sure this will get my but in gear!!!",1315872000,105,1320,4.250996015936255
4599809,5,B0058M07US,I lost about 15 pounds doing the original Tae Bo Get ripped series.  After a few dissapointing workouts I decided to give this one a try and I am glad I did!  I am in pretty decent shape; I alternate between jogging and climbing stairs but this workout had me dripping in sweat 15 minutes into it.  Billy is wonderful in explaining each move and each technique.  He has also gotten better in his counting cue.  This workout consist of almost 30 minutes of tae bo cardio and about another 30 minutes of weights with some Tae Bo moves.  If your looking for a great workout on days you can't get to the gym or outdoors or need a change in your workout routine I would recommend this workout tape.,1315785600,15,693,4.292307692307692
4599810,5,B0058M07US,"I LOVE this!! Such an amazing workout!! I got this dvd hoping it would be a good supplement to my high intensity Zumba toning class that I'm only able to attend once a week now. I'm so happy to say that this workout definately delivers!! I'm always dripping sweat and definately getting an amazing workout, especially with the weights he adds. I've done it with weights, without weights and done just the first half when I'm short on time. It's very versitile. I love that he combines cardo TaeBo moves and then adds in the hand weights. It's a full body workout especially if you are engaging your core the entire time. Would totally recommend this to anyone wanting to get a super sweaty full body workout. Plus Billy is always so motivating. You really can't go wrong!!",1314316800,20,772,4.601449275362318
4599811,5,B0058M07US,"This is an awesome workout.  It consists of cardio for the first 25 or so minutes and then it goes into toning with light free weights for another 25 minutes, then the cool down.  I usually  lift between 15-25 lbs at the gym with free weights, but I literraly had to use 5 lb wieghts.  It worked every muscle in my body.  I would highly recommend this video.  Love it!",1314230400,55,368,4.185714285714286
4599812,5,B0058M07US,"I got Taebo Ripped Extreme the other day at Target as a source of variety from my P90X and Insanity DVDs. I gotta be honest, I was sweating more with this than with either of the others. I absolutely love this workout. It's about an hour. It consists of great energy and powerful punch and kick move sequences for the first half to get you warmed up and sweating..then, you use small dumbbells to work every muscle in your upper body (biceps,triceps,shoulders, back, and chest)

I am soooo glad I picked this up. Billy Blanks is an awesome motivator, and there are some really cute chicks in the vid too.

5 stars to Billy, great DVD!

4599815,3,B0058M07US,"Wish I would have known that this is mostly holding a squat position and just moving your arms (bicep curls, tricep extensions...etc). The first half is a good cardio warm up. Depends on what kind of work out you want. I prefer constant movement and lots of cardio. So if that is what you are looking for, this is not the DVD for you.",1468195200,,334,4.234375

4599818,5,B0058M07US,I thought Ultimate Tae Bo was hard... This was harder! First half was high-intensity routines. Second half was toning with weights sometimes combined with his signature tae bo moves. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good sweat and have fun doing it.,1452124800,,262,4.717391304347826

4599821,5,B0058M07US,"I have stayed fit with advanced-level Tae Bo for years, but the first time I did this one, I literally had to lay down on the floor to rest! My heart was racing and I was completely spent. I kept going with it though, and within a week I was seeing muscle definition in my upper arms I've NEVER had. That was really motivating, and now it's several months later, and I think I am the fittest I've ever been in my life. I'm still absolutely drenched in sweat at the end (I'm using heavier weights). There are the same issues as always - uneven counts, more or fewer reps than he originally said - but once you've done the routine several times, you can switch sides to keep it even. Love it!",1439251200,8,690,4.195488721804511
4599822,5,B0058M07US,Better than his typical DVD's.  Good quality workout.,1438473600,,53,5.625
4599823,3,B0058M07US,I can see how it would be a great workout once you've completed the DVD several times and start to get the hang of the combinations. I did sweat a decent amount and the arm workout is awesome. My husband and I are fairly fit and have done many extreme DVDs but the combinations are just too confusing and frustrating. We ended up just flailing our arms and legs about and laughing too hard to keep up. It's not a good sign when you can't do the DVD not because of the physical difficulty but because some of the moves are just ridiculous. I understand trying to be different and keeping the moves interesting but sometimes basic is best.,1437782400,2,637,4.361344537815126
4599824,5,B0058M07US,"I did this workout on the Taebo Platinum collection DVD...and I LOVE IT! Mostly because it's half cardio, half strength. You WILL work every muscle in your arms. It's a bit challenging. My strong suite is my legs, so I have to take some breaks when I work my arms. It also works your abs from time to time. This workout has everything. The only thing that annoys me about his DVDs is how he'll say like ""2 more sets to go!"" Then we end up doing like 4 more sets. It's like he forgets where he's counting or something. Anyways, I can blow that off. I mean, I guess I can understand. He's in front of the camera, trying to talk, show good form, and pay attention to the people in the background at the same time, so there is a lot going on. But anyways, Billy Blanks is wonderful, and it's a shame more people don't know about Taebo. I think it should be  more known, like Zumba or whatever that is. I feel like Taebo is underrated for some reason...I don't think people get just how effective Billy Blanks really is.",1435622400,2,1015,4.231958762886598
4599835,5,B0058M07US,"Love it!! First half consists of primarily Tae Bo, second half focuses on strength training using weights. Easy to burn 400+ calories with this workout. My new favorite!!",1435449600,2,170,5.107142857142857
4599836,5,B0058M07US,"This is a great workout if you want the combination of cardio and weights.  I see some reviews not liking the weights towards the end but I loved it since I am trying to get more toned arms. It was nice learning the proper form and I am seeing a difference in my arms in just a couple of months. To get more cardio in my workout I combine this one (complete 1st) with This is Tae Bo which is fast paced, no weights, and a lot of fun.",1434585600,,433,3.865168539325843
4599837,1,B0058M07US,I do Taebo workouts a lot and bought this DVD based on the positive reviews. I have to say that I am very disappointed on this workout. He busted out into moves that made it hard to follow. The whole ending was just this arm weight bullsh#%t. I hated the whole workout. I love Taebo however this was not his best!,1433635200,,313,4.147540983606557
4599838,5,B0058M07US,"OMG!!! Billy will work you! My limbs are so sore, and feel like they want to fall off after my work outs, but I love it.  You WILL feel the burn, and if you're consistent with the workouts, you will see results.  I still can't complete the 60 minutes without catching my breath, but I plan to get there.  I love Billy and his team--very motivating.",1431302400,2,348,4.242424242424242

4599843,4,B0058M07US,"So, I had not tried Tae-Bo in quite a few years and thought I would give it a whirl again. I forgot how fast the moves go with his video! I was pouring sweat afterwards, but I think I will stick to my other cardio videos.

4599844,5,B0058M07US,"I have many trainers - Jillian, Jackie , T25 (hard on my feet), PiYO, Brazil Butts (tougher than you think).
 I enjoy them all but....my ""go to guy"" who always gives me results - Billy!
For some reason I do really enjoy him and when I can not get the results I am looking for - I turn back to Tae-Bo.
There are a few(through the years) that he goes adrift and he kind of makes it more about him than good through workout -( too much talking at times)
This is not one of them. Great Cardio first have and weighted work out second half, (not heavy - more than enough reps to work the muscles)
You can't beat the price, and when you are in a rut and need to try something new to you, this may be a good fit.",1424563200,2,704,3.923076923076923

4599851,5,B0058M07US,This is a lot of fun and really gets you moving. I've always enjoyed the energy you get with Billy Blanks and this one is no different. You will definitely feel it when you're done.,1404604800,2,181,4.2

4599853,5,B0058M07US,"This workout is phenomenal! I don't want to discourgae beginners from trying this. It is very difficult, but that's where the results are!. My motto is, ""The place where you want to quit is where all the results are found"". It starts with a 30 minute challenging cardio workout. For an extra challenge, do this while wearing weighted gloves (1 pounders). Then, it's 30 minutes of weights and I thought would never end. This workout will leave to feeling exhausted, sweaty and like, ""'WTH was that??"" But you WILL definitely get results with this if you stick with it! I'd been begging my husband to do this with me and finally he did over the weekend. He belongs to an extreme fitness gym that, as the name implies, does all sorts of extreme cardio kickboxing. He was crabby most of the time, saying this was just too hard, but afterwards, he says he felt sore in his triceps.
Things I like about this workout: It's an hour. Anything from 45-60 minutes is where I see results. Workouts that are only 30 minutes will not acheive a good calorie burn. Billy Blanks instructs the workout like a regular class, so you don't spend a lot of time learning the moves, he just jumps right in. If you are not familar with the workouts, spend time on the tutorial. I love that he doesn't waste time teaching all the moves. After all. It's a DVD, you'll master them aftger doing it a few times. P90X does this and it's annoying. Billy Blaks is an awesome coach and instructor. He doesn't waste a lot of time chatting about dumb stuff, he just jumps right into shouting encouraging phrases, and getting on you when he knows your getting tired. The music is upbeat and has a great cadence.
Highly recommend to anyone looking for real results!",1404086400,7,1727,4.538461538461538
4599854,5,B0058M07US,"This is one of the best workout DVD's I own now. It's cardio intense followed by an interval of strength training made up of some unique strength exercises I had not seen/done before, focused on the upper body and some core work, although you are pretty  much working your core through the duration of the video with the cardio moves. After the strength training, it's back to strength plus cardio for the lower body but your breath gets going again toward the end of the video. Billy Blanks is an enthusiastic instructor and he's not without humor or charm at some points, and he's definitely doing most of the work out with you and showing you proper technique and form as well. Even his cool down segment has some intensity to it--I've never done a cool down which consists of push-up's! By the end of the video you feel like you've worked hard and you feel great. Highly recommended for a great cardio + strength combo. I will be checking out more of Billy Blanks' videos if they are anything compared to this one.",1403395200,5,1018,4.532608695652174
4599855,5,B0058M07US,"Anytime it's raining (or other unfriendly weather) and I don't feel like running on a treadmill or going to the gym I pop in this dvd and sweat. This dvd works your entire body with strength and gives a nice cardio burn too with his ""rip it"" moments (cardio bursts). The monotonous chanting from his helpers gets a little annoying after awhile but I just tune them out or put it on pause and play music instead.",1403136000,,411,4.35064935064935
4599856,5,B0058M07US,All of his workouts are a challenge and that's why I love them. I am in shape and this one in particular made me sweat! It's a good workout for anyone!,1400976000,,151,3.903225806451613
4599857,3,B0058M07US,Great at-home workout! Sometimes the beat is too fast or too slow! The ladies in the video demonstrate great form!,1396828800,,114,4.75
4599858,5,B0058M07US,"I have a tone of Billy Blanks DVD's & workout on them 5-6 days a week for the last 8 months straight. Most of them have become too easy for me so I was looking for more challenge. Was contemplating buying T25 but then this dvd came in the mail before I could order T25. I did this workout today and boy was I sweating in less than 5 minutes! It's a very fast paced workout ( the first 28 minutes of Cardio ). I almost quit at the 28th minute mark when they get weights. I believe if I stopped at that point, I would have put in as much exercise as someone doing T25. So I'll save my $25 and give this a shot. Definately NOT for beginners! Some moves are just too damn hard and fast, but it's a challange am willing to take. Lots of arm exercise, total body workout. Highly recommend, but be ready for your butt to be kicked! By far, the toughest Billy Blanks workout I have ever done. Makes Cardio Explosion look like a walk in the park. Go on, get it!

UPDATE:
I have never revisited any of my reviews to update on a product, but this one....I have to.
I have worked out on this dvd for four days now. Am now getting the hang of the moves, but still very intense workout. I can not believe that I have lost 4 lbs in four days!! And am not even trying to loose weight. That means am loosing 1 pound per day? Never happened to me before. I did loose 30 lbs on Billy Blanks dvd's, but am done with weight lose. This workout leaves me soaking wet with sweat in 30 mins,I think because he does lee talking and more workout, you get the most workout in this workout. I don't have weights, so I do the weight part with bare hands which still burns like hell. This is good pain. For anyone trying to loose weight, don't give up on this dvd. It works!",1396224000,5,1743,4.03757225433526
4599859,5,B0058M07US,This one takes Taebo up a notch and provides a bit harder workout if you have done some of the other workouts.,1395360000,,110,4.045454545454546

4599861,5,B0058M07US,This is definitely a challenging exercise - love to get my ass kicked on this one. And using just 4 lb weights is more than enough to make your muscles feel the burn.,1388966400,,166,4.0606060606060606
4599862,5,B0058M07US,"I thought I was ready for this workout but after about 20 minutes I had to give up.  It's very intense, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for beginners.  I consider this to be very advanced.  I should have taken my time, but hey, that's what mistakes are for.  But I must say, even if you're not able to complete this whole video, whatever you can give is definitely worth the time and effort.  You will be sore but you won't be disappointed.  I plan to revisit this dvd once my endurance and strength improve (or once I muster the courage anyway)",1388534400,3,555,4.392156862745098
4599863,5,B0058M07US,Wow! Just did this video for the first time and I am so motivated now. I have been struggling to get a good home workout routine together. I am sometimes disappointed when I feel like I didn't get a good workout; I feel like I wasted my time. Not here! I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome arm workout here. I know for sure that my arms will get pumped if I continue this video. Now I'm thinking I might look into some other Billy Blanks workouts!,1386460800,,452,4.206896551724138
4599864,5,B0058M07US,"Great for relieving neck and shoulder tension.  I get headaches and stiffness pretty much every day.  This workout is now one of my favorites.  I have many Jillian Michaels DVDs and P90X, yoga DVDs and this one works in nicely with those for a change.  Also for those who say Billy is too old and should hang it up.........I am sure he can still kick your butt!  Billy just proves that staying fit keeps you young longer.",1386374400,,421,4.415584415584416

4599866,5,B0058M07US,The first part of this workout is all cardio.  It does have a few new moves than his other workouts.  The second part is a good workout for your arms.  (He also combines cardio with the weight lifting.)  The whole workout is about 55 minutes long.  There are more ab exercises in this one (or at least it feels like it!!)  I really like this one.  It seems more organized and put together than his other DVD's.,1380844800,,410,4.246753246753247

4599868,5,B0058M07US,"I am a fan of Billy Blanks and have many of his workouts!  This is a tough workout and not for those who have not done his workouts before.  He works you hard and this is intense.  You have to stay focused and be determined. He does have one encounter with one of his team members who could not keep up. It is toward the end of the workout and she seemed to just be out of energy. He spends quite a bit of time trying to keep her moving and when you watch this several times, it does get annoying so I just turn the volume down and keep going til that session is finished.  It is well worth it if you want to have a full body routine with some weights and lots of cardio. It hits all the muscle groups including your heart! You will burn calories too!",1376352000,,751,3.9536423841059603
4599869,5,B0058M07US,This dvd has really given me the workout I needed. Was ready for a challenge and I knew from my past Billy Blanks videos that he would do the job.,1375574400,,146,3.9
4599870,5,B0058M07US,I love this video. I used to do Tae-Bo every morning in my condo when I lived in Japan.  I love the way he makes you count to 8 and how there is always movement.,1374624000,,161,3.6
4599871,5,B0058M07US,Really intense on the upper body including abs. Touches some on lower body but not a huge focus. The routine is different and low impact but isolates a lot of arm and shoulder/back muscle groups.,1373673600,,195,4.6

4599873,5,B0058M07US,"I have always wanted to get a Tae Bo workout video after doing them ten years ago for high school gym class. After reading a lot of reviews and looking at my fitness goals I got this video. I run three days a week and since I don't have access to a gym I wanted something that would involve weights. This video has some cardio but it's main focus is on your arms. I use three pound weights and there are still some moves that I can't do or I can't complete all the reps after doing this video for about three weeks. I agree with others that often Billy will say one more set and often you do two, but I feel like the workout itself is a tough one that really works you. And I don't know many workout videos that make you do sixteen push-ups in the cool down. The first probably twenty minutes you do combinations of kicking and punching which it takes a little bit to get the moves down. After that it's pretty much using the weights and then about a five minute cool down. For me I really enjoy doing this workout video because I find it challenging.",1372291200,,1051,4.131707317073171
4599874,5,B0058M07US,I like a hardcore workout and this is definitely that!  I was pleasantly surprised by the weight section... it was tough and easy to grow with it with heavier weights.  The workout style really works for me because I know I only have a few more reps before I get a short break so I'm more inclined to keep pushing to the last one.  Unlike some of his other tapes... he keeps everyone moving without a lot of talking in between the different moves.,1372204800,,447,4.2976190476190474
4599875,4,B0058M07US,"I found this one to be a pretty good workout. It is better than most of his other routines and I did like that he actually used weights for a change but it still has the same problem that almost all of his workouts have, Billy just can't shut-up or count.  Also too much time spent training you how to do the moves, like it is your first day of every working out.

4599880,2,B0058M07US,I have many TaeBo dvds in my collection and this is my least favorite. I agree with another reviewer who said that the L punch and kick combo is just plain awkward-if you do it slow to try to figure it out you don't sweat but if you speed it up you look like a spaz on drugs and risk falling flat on your face. In many of his dvds when they speed up the excercises I just don't look at the screen because I get so mixed up-I just count in my head and go slow. I learned the hard way last year when I sped up the excercise and the next day could not lift my head up because I had 2 herniated discs.

I only use two pound weights in each hand and find it to be enough and I'm in shape!  This video is long, almost a complete hour even if I skip the stretches at the end.  It is challenging for me and, like I mentioned above, I'm in shape.  I highly recommend the three DVDs I mentioned above, as the group mixes challenging with a little less challenging.

Admittedly, the first part of the cardio section is tedious. It's a lot of knee lift and punch combo. After that, it picks up and makes you sweat a lot. It goes seamlessly into a 30 minute weight lifting part that has a mix of cardio moves without weights at the end. I sometimes do the weights section by itself. Either way you do this workout, you will sweat a lot and feel so good afterwards. Also, it's fun watching the people who are doing the workout on the tape. You'll notice funny things they do. Watch the woman in the red - she's got some sassy looks when Billy is telling you to amp it up and squeeze your biceps. Her face is probably showing exactly what you're feeling.

I used 28 oz cans of pumpkin filling until I could get what I needed. Kind of awkward but amazing how heavy they get during the 2nd half of the workout! Some of the combo moves I had never seen and so I struggled to keep up with them so far. Getting better every time I do them however. The reason for 4 stars is I wish they did a little leg and glutes work. I've been doing the last 15 minutes of the old advanced video to make up for it.

Thanks to watching my diet and trying Tae Bo, I dropped 10 pounds in a month, and ultimately, a total of 25 pounds in 6 months. My conditioning has improved greatly. Being a big fan of Billy Blanks' series and his motivational style, I gave ""Ripped Extreme"" a try. By far, it is the toughest Tae Bo yet. I barely made it though the workout the first time I tried it, but Blanks is keeping me motivated to keep pushing myself to master this DVD.

The only criticism I had: there wasn't anything on the packaging (that I noticed, anyway) that mentions the need for dumbbells. I wouldn't recommend having anything more than two 5 pound dumbbells.",1350777600,,815,4.433333333333334
4599904,5,B0058M07US,"Holy COW!  I wanted a few more challenging workouts to mix up my P90 routine...well this is it. First half of the video is VERY fast paced cardio kickboxing moves. If you've done Tae Bo before there is nothing new in here that you haven't seen before. I admit I'm not that coordinated on some of the moves - whatever..I was kicking, I was punching, I was moving - even if not in sync with them. It's fast paced.  Then it went to the weights and the arms. No problem...I've got this I thought. I've been doing P90 (no p90x) for the last few months using 5lb and 8lbs weights.  OH heck no!

There are SO many reps and then they do them at a cardio pace that I had a better chance of seeing God than keeping up with 5lbs weights. I ended up using NO weights for many reps. Started with 5lbs, then went to no weights..then mid workout found my 1 lb hand weights.. used those when we are really pumping - I'm telling you I was still burning like crazy.. then I had to go to no weights again. I have 2lb weights around, I will find those and start out with a lower weight so that hopefully I can do more reps.

You will SWEAT in this workout, it is hard, when I couldn't keep up (like in the weights section), I didn't! Dont overdo it, you'll feel the burn even doing no weights if you are first starting. There is one girl that is visibly struggling in this workout. She looks like she might cry and she's going for it and it makes you keep going just by knowing they are all going for the burn here and no, it's not easy.

TOUGH workout - NOT FOR BEGINNERS, If you have never done Tae bo before - do NOT get this one.. get one of the Tae Bo Basics.  It will be some time before I'm able to keep up with the weight section in this workout, but its a good one when I'm looking for a challenge.

The first half of this video is pretty good, although Billy seems a little stressed out. The girls behind him are giving each other high 5's and he chastises them several times for wasting time. The first half is all cardio which is good. Unfortunately, the 2nd half is all upper body weights. It seems like about 45 different arm/shoulder exercises in a row! No one needs to work out those muscles for that long, in my opinion. I thought the video was ok.

4599909,3,B0058M07US,"I have been doing Tae Bo since about 1998. I started with his original Basic and Advanced on videos. I had purchased this one because I was thinking that it was kind of like his ""Get Ripped"" two pack series that he did in the early 2000's.  (Once again on video, I was hoping to get it on DVD.)

Well, this is nothing like the Get Ripped videos. He has kind of a whole new style now from when he first started. While this workout can make you sweat, it isn't extreme like Get Ripped. It reminds me of his more low impact stuff like his Believer's Workout. This one doesn't have much of a warm up in it and it really is all about the arms. The last half he adds some hand weight routines for you to do, which I really liked because I can always use a good work out on my arms!

However, it wasn't what I expected and because he is changing his style up a bit it is harder for me to do. I have a very bad back, and Billy Blanks has been the only work outs that I have been able to do, which is why I collect them.  I was able to do his earlier stuff because he wasn't adding a bunch of tricky combo moves where you were constantly twisting your spine. Most of his earlier stuff your back stayed in uniform. Even with the twists at the waist on the punches and stuff, it was fine because your spine stayed in line.

I'm just not able to do his new workout style. I stick with his early stuff because it gets the heart going, it's high impact, there isn't an excessive amount of twisting the spine and it's not as hard to follow.

Younger people may enjoy this workout and the new style. Also if they don't have any back injuries, they wouldn't have any problems with the moves. It will get you sweating about 1/2 way through!",1343606400,5,1722,4.064896755162242

I know some reviews are saying about the complicated moves, and I agree, at first go, you could be a bit lost, but the idea of these workouts are that you are not going to do them just the once! After a few workouts, I got the hang of the moves, and I'm so uncoordinated.  I find the jumps with the weights a bit hard on my knees, so I just carry on with the weights and do a squat instead.

 The ""L-Step"" gets a bit too complicated for me, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars, but I just fast-forward through that and run in place while that is happening. I'm sure if I tried hard enough, I would catch on, but am not very coordinated!

 I love this DVD because I feel as though I get a complete body workout and am SEEING changes, which is the ultimate payout.

4599918,5,B0058M07US,"This is the first review I have ever done here on amazon... Which should say ALOT.
I LOVE Billy Blanks and this new cardio-tae-bo-kickbox-bicep workout.
I just did it last night.. My arms and my posterior are sore...
I was looking for a new workout by Billy, and this one is now at the top of my fitness list. Jillian Michaels is another
one of my favourites, but I like Billy the best!

I am a pretty darn fit girl, having exercised regularly ( and recently started running also) for the last 3 years after quitting a chain-smoking habit.
( Yes, it can be done, if I can do it, you can too!!)
After quitting smoking, I did Billy Blanks' Total Transformation Training with the t3 weights( Highly recommended that program too
also, esp for those new to tae-bo) to help me get healthier.
I NEVER exercised in my life prior. I am convinced the t3 workout helped me develop and stick with an exercise regimen, and make it a
permanent part of my life. ( And much is due to Billy's inspirational attitude..!)

 Mr. Blanks is motivational spiritual, and sincere. I love that about him. He is very inspiring, along with
his daughter Shelly ( who is often beside him in his videos, always busting her a**).
I can't thank him enough for helping me literally ""change"" my life.
What I wouldn't give to have him as a personal trainer!!",1334793600,,1322,4.477178423236515

I love that the DVD has:
  - Great energy
  - Consistent bursts of cardio
  - Good (short) recovery periods
  - Effective & challenging
  - Provides a solid, well-rounded workout between the cardio kick boxing (shadow boxing) and the sculpting that he does for the final part of the DVD.

For a cardio kickboxing DVD, it's relatively low-impact because there are only a few moves that involve jumping, and for the most part, it's really easy to follow.

My only recommendation is that you watch the tutorial (even if you've been doing Tae Bo forever) prior to doing the DVD for the first time because there are a few more complicated combinations that threw me for a loop.

Also, my only complaint is the fact that sometimes Billy's narration/instruction can get a little disjointed when he stops to make a side note or something.

Otherwise, I think it's a good option for getting some good cardio in at home, so I definitely recommend this DVD.",1332115200,,1028,4.633333333333334

I'm not exactly in the best of shape (I'm trying though!) so I'm working out 4-5 times a week. I love to kickbox, and that did help me during this DVD. Even though I'm a beginner at Tae Bo, I didn't have a lot of trouble following along this time. I rated it only 4 stars because some of the moves were a little too fast (but still doable at a slower speed). The DVD is kind of broken down in 2 parts where the first 25 minutes is cardio and the second 25 minutes is toning (and a little cardio) with weights. I think the DVD would be more beneficial if those were 2 separate workout options instead of one long 50 minute video (another reason why I rated it 4 stars). I will say though the toning part with weights is pretty good/intense! I used 3 pound weights, but I was having trouble keeping up sometimes. My arms were really burning. It's a really good toning section!

As a beginner, I thought the DVD was pretty easy to follow. Like I said, some of the moves went a little too fast, but it was still a really good workout!",1332028800,,1308,4.10546875
4599925,5,B0058M07US,I love this workout! It is tough - but you feel great when it is done. The first half is typical Tae Bo and the second half is with hand weights. I started with light weights and now a few weeks later (I do this one once or twice a week) I am moving to heavier weights. I can tell that I'm getting stronger! To me - that is the sign of a good workout. I just love Billy Blanks too. He keeps me going and seems to really care about you - even though he is on your TV set. Hard to accompish!,1331164800,,489,3.7115384615384617
4599926,1,B0058M07US,"I feel like Billy Blanks has not created a good workout since his originals. When I had my second child in 2001 I weighed 250lbs! I bought Taebo Advanced on vhs and worked out everyday to it. I loved it and I dropped to 165 very quickly. Eventually my VCR ate my tape and I was never able to find it again. Now you can buy the tape on Amazon at a ridiculously high price , but where does one buy a VCR now days and even if you do its not worth it for one tape. I wish that Billy Blanks would put that workout on a dvd format. I bought this dvd because some of the reviews were impressive. However, I found the same with this one as with all the others I've tried . He simply dances around, his moves are uncoordinated and it seems like he is grasping to create something that resembles a workout. You spend more time trying to figure out what hes doing then actually working out! Big disappointment I will never buy another Billy Blanks workout again.",1330128000,5,951,4.145945945945946
4599927,4,B0058M07US,"If you're looking for a cardio workout, then I would recommend this. I've done his This is Tae Bo video, and this one is more challenging and gets your heart pumping. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because he spends about half of his time telling his exercise girls to have more energy, almost to the point of berating them. It got a bit annoying to me after awhile, but if you can get past this, it's an excellent exercise - not for beginners.",1329264000,,452,4.206896551724138

This is a quite annoying workout. They change moves so many times I am so busy learning new moves I don't know if I can get any workout done. I am not really in for learning new dancy/kickboxy moves every 20 sec.
I only used twice, and I really don't think i will do it again.",1329004800,2,330,4.092307692307692
4599930,3,B0058M07US,"I love Billy Blanks.  He is inspirational and I like how moves are all done in rythmn/counting sets of 8.  Tae Bo Ripped Extreme is NOT my favorite.  I didn't like how ""creative"" he got with the moves in places, making it difficult to follow.  Too many combo moves in one set.  I prefer his ""This is Tae Bo"" that came out around the same time.  That one keeps you moving and isn't too complicated.  You will sweat either way- but I found this one more frustrating.",1328659200,12,464,4.264367816091954
4599931,5,B0058M07US,Really great at home work out DVD!  I was really pleased with the combination of cardio and strength training!

4599932,5,B0058M07US,"I have been doing Tae Bo for years and as I became more physically fit, found Tae Bo wasn't as challenging.  This workout is fantastic and definately a challenge.  I workout 4-5 days a week at a gym and consider myself in fairly good shape.  I recently tried ""Insanity"" and hated it because it was absolutely zero fun.  This workout provides not only a great workout, combining both cardio and strength training, but is also enjoyable.  Definately worth the money!",1327276800,,464,4.75
4599933,4,B0058M07US,"No regrets at all about this purchase. It gets my heart pumping for the first half hour, followed by another approx half hour of toning using weights. The latter puts a greater focus on the arms and upper body, which I need. Two of the choreographies had my feet in a tangle the first couple of times, making this a little more complex choreography-wise than Billy Blank's Cardio Inferno. Something that disturbs me about this DVD, and the reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, occurs somewhere towards the end of the DVD where Billy Blanks asked one of the team not to give up. His tone and demeanor then, the way he said it, and the expression on his face, make very uncomfortable. I don't think that was necessary at all, and its a pain having to see that regularly.
ON the whole, a good workout.",1326844800,,799,4.405405405405405

4599935,5,B0058M07US,Very extreme workout. Not for begginers. Billy uses hand weights and you can also use wieghted gloves for more calorie burn.  If you want a hard productive workout this is for you.,1325980800,,180,4.625
4599936,5,B0058M07US,"Great workout! Constant motivation.

I wanted something as hard as Jane Fonda's old ""Challenge"" workout, ninety minutes of intense moves including extensive ab work. This workout was produced on tape only and hasn't been reissued on DVD.

But with Badass Billy, you don't need crunchies. He seems to have learned something Bruce Lee said, that all movement starts in the midsection and works it out. It's your hinge and probably the soul's down there amidst the sewage pipes and fun parts.

Blanks keeps up a constant stream of DI-style motivational talk taken in part from the military. He calls upon you to be in the room as did my Outward Bound instructors.

I've only worked out, so far, once and did not use weights all the way through. I suggest a range of free weights and no weight at all, whatever works.

Lots of pretty girls which I find a motivator.

This will definitely join my workouts along with Hanoi Jane, Heemelayaa's Bollywood workouts, running and swimming in the ocean!",1325894400,,991,4.8
4599937,5,B0058M07US,"I bought this because I wanted to upgrade my exercise collection. It is another great hit by Billy Blanks. The length of this workout is 60 minutes, but you can always break it up. Great not for just cardio but strength training as well.",1325203200,,237,4.409090909090909
4599938,4,B0058M07US,"I've never done any of Billy Blanks' other workout videos, but for several years I've done a kickboxing class at my local gym twice a week.  The class closed last year and I've had trouble finding another one.  I'm an exercising/fitness junkie and enjoy a mix of running, weight lifting, cycling, swimming, and tons of at home videos.  I workout 3-4 times a week.  I have 5 of Jillian Michael's DVDs at home and love the workout those give.  I received this video for Christmas.  I liked the video.  After having done kickboxing for years, I was familiar with almost all the moves, but there's a nice tutorial segment you can choose if you aren't.  My only negative was that Billy moves MUCH faster than I ever did in my class.  (And I thought we moved fast!)  Sometimes, I have to slow it down a little because the weird turning and movements mess with my knees.  Otherwise, it's awesome cardio and a great workout!  The last 20-30 minutes are used with light weights (I used 3 and 5 lbs) and it's high cardio too.  If you're a kickboxing fan, it's a nice at home workout!",1325030400,7,1073,4.441025641025641
4599939,3,B0058M07US,"I'm an intermediate exerciser. I'd say this is a pretty average workout.

4599943,5,B0058M07US,Ok I am workout freak on and off. When i'm on i'm on and when i'm off its only because I can't afford the trips to the gym 20 miles away everyday so I decided to try this out in my off time. I have never been big on cardio even though I have played sports my whole life. When I was in football all I did was heavy lifting and then I got my cardio in at practice. After football ended I continued my heavy weight training and eventually stopped doing cardio all together. I am still in relatively good shape but I needed to step it up for the fire academy. My first time using this video I couldn't get all the way through it. I was sweating after 15 min and I was definitely sore the next day (a good sore). The only thing that might be looked at as a negative about this DVD is the memorization of the workouts themselves. With the high pace this DVD uses it's hard to keep up just because the movements are so fast you just kinda guess until you get it right. Personally that is not a negative it just takes a little bit of practice like everything else All in all this was a great buy!,1321056000,2,1088,3.9954128440366974
4599944,5,B0058M07US,"This is a great workout no doubt about it. Dripping sweat everytime. Couple things I noticed over the past couple of weeks though. He really hammers the deltoids(shoulders). He does 4 exercises in a row working the shoulders. Seriously , even with 2 pound dumbells , I have to put the weights down. It's a tad too much. Perhaps I'm just a wimp, dunno but I wish he would have added a leg workout inbetween. Another thing I noticed is a jumo kick exercise towards the end. Even though I have been out of it for a while , I remember my Muay Thai instructor pounding into our heads that jumpkicks are useless. Better off slamming someone in the knee than trying for a stylish kick to the head. So, I added my own quick snap knee kick in for the jumpkick.

In closing, this is a Very Good DVD. Just those 2 things bother me a bit so I knocked off 1/2 point. I would also recommend this to anyone. A piece of advice though. If you haven't done TaeBo before, watch out! This is my first TaeBo DVD and I think its a bit too much. So I worked up to the point where I can do the whole workout now. I was just doing the first half of the DVD at first.",1320192000,6,1141,4.071111111111111
4599945,4,B0058M07US,"I'm giving it 4 stars (still no half stars) as a very decent cardio workout -- the last portion of the DVD is very light weight training (biceps, triceps, forearms, shoulders) that has high repetitions with very light weights.

Otherwise, IMO, the cardio portion surpasses P90X cardio workouts (P90X has too much ""downtime"" in between cardio exercises) -- Ripped is non-stop for over 25 minutes.

It is a very inexpensive routine (even if you pay full price) that can allow some change in your normal cardio routine.",1319673600,4,516,4.919540229885057
4599946,5,B0058M07US,"I recently purchased this DVD entitled Tae Bo Ripped Extreme. I have been working out with Billy for quite a while and it was time for a new Tae Bo DVD. I must emphasize this workout is absolutely not for beginners or first time tae boers.

In the beginning, I cannot hear Billy because the volume is very low, but he gets loud around the middle. The entire workout is very intense!  There is no talking or laughing because everyone is extremely focused on the workout which is what I like.

The first 30 minutes is straight cardio and once one set is complete, he immediately jumps right into another set. There is no time for getting water because it is non-stop.

The second 30 minutes is tough toning and every muscle including the ones you may not know you have are tested. I might add even the warm-up and cool down is good.

I thoroughly enjoyed this workout and I was dripping in sweat. You can feel your waist slimming down, body toning up and cardiovascular improving.
