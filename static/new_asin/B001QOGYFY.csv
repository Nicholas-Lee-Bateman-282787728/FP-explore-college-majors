3766715,3,B001QOGYFY,"I didn't quite know what to expect when I sat down in the theater today to watch Whiteout. The trailers led me to believe it would be some sort of supernatural type film set in Antarctica, but I wasn't really sure if it was just the weather that would be the evil force or some sort of creature. It was none of the above. Whiteout is really just a typical thriller/mystery that happens to occur on the coldest land mass in the world. It involves some murders back in 1957 and few more in present day that Kate's character investigates. Within the first ten minutes you get the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stripping down to her undies (always a good thing), but I didn't expect that to be the films only true highlight. Other than her obvious use in that particular scene, I can't believe they casted a good looking woman only to cover her up from head to toe and in multiple layers for the last 90 minutes. Not to mention a giant snow hat on her head. Anyways, most of the acting was okay I guess. Kind of bland, but nothing noticeably bad.

Whiteout is actually pretty darn entertaining if you take it for what it is and don't expect anything special. It deserves better than all the negative reviews it is receiving from the critics, but I have to admit that without the early gratuitous scene or the atmospheric location, I probably wouldn't give this thing more that two stars. You might get a couple of shivers from this one, but those looking for some true frostbite should stick with John Carpenter's The Thing.",1252713600,96,1515,4.489130434782608
3766716,2,B001QOGYFY,"While many have found graphic novels to be an excellent template for film adaptations, not all of them translate well to the big screen. Sadly, such is the case with Whiteout, which suffers in everything from the major (lackluster characters, crippling flashback quantities) to the minor (shoddy special effects, blatant continuity errors). As Kate Beckinsale trades fangs and skintight leather for parkas, she also leaves the entertainment value out in the cold. At least the suspense is handled with some care, though the harsh weather is far scarier than the ice-pick wielding villain.

A troubled past finds U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) stationed at a remote scientific research facility in Antarctica. With only three days left before the base is plunged into a six-month-long darkness, Stetko is called upon to investigate a mysterious sighting. Uncovering the mutilated body of a scientist, she must race against time to solve the murder before she's trapped with a killer in the coldest, most isolated place in the world.

The flashback doesn't have to be a painful storytelling technique, but Whiteout manages to horrifically abuse the tool. In poorly derived moments the film flashes back to the opening scene, to hazy, orange-colored character establishing memories and, in perhaps the most idiotic moment, to less than one minute ago. It's nothing short of staggeringly insulting to the audience. Carrie's history has almost no affect on her ability to catch the killer and is so simple that it could have been summed up in a routine conversation. Early on, the film even misuses fading to black, repeatedly creating a disorienting sense of missing footage.

Movies like 30 Days of Night or The Thing have already, more impressively, utilized an abnormally cold setting and toy with the viewer's fears of extreme isolation, distrust and paranoia. In Whiteout, claustrophobia, asphyxiation and being buried alive are also introduced, along with the common, location-specific ""freezing to death."" What isn't so notable is the whiteout of the title, a snowstorm with 100 mph winds that prevent visibility beyond six inches. During the brief scenes dealing with the storm, the lack of sight is frequently anticlimactic, particularly when the blurry, fighting figures are nearly indistinguishable.

Director Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds, Swordfish) must have been exceptionally proud of the special makeup effects department, donating generous amounts of screentime to disturbing shots of badly mutilated bodies. To make up for the grisly images is an immoderately gratuitous shower scene with Beckinsale that somehow produces no inappropriate nudity. Apparently the clarity inside a bathroom is as hindered as outside in the blizzard.

3766737,3,B001QOGYFY,"actually, I can't really fault the acting or the storyline...  or even the directing (well, it was pretty lame direction though).  for me this is a case of a suspense movie having the soundtrack of something from the Hallmark channel.  completely ruining the entire film for me.  seriously, the last bit of muzak before the credits roll sound like something the cast of 'Murder, She Wrote' would be wrapping up an episode with.
and talk about wimpy characters, that's where the bad direction comes into play...  the actors weren't bad, just pretty predictable dialogue and not much to work with between storm sequences.

bottom line, if you're watching this I hope you got it through Amazon Prime or Cinamax and didn't pay outright for the movie...  its bad enough you wasted time (like I did) watching this.",1520899200,,808,4.854014598540146
3766738,1,B001QOGYFY,"This is the first movie review I have ever written on Prime so I will keep it short.... This movie was garbage. It had so many opportunities to be interesting... and yet, it was straight garbage at every turn. At least Kate is hot.... thats about all I can say.",1520726400,2,261,4.24
3766739,5,B001QOGYFY,"This was just a great little horror/mystery/ghost story and stop taking everything so seriously.  This was a much better use of my time than The Birth Of A Nation which got Oscar's nod, so just get a bucket of popcorn and stretch out in your sweats and love this little overlooked goodie.",1520553600,,288,4.538461538461538
3766740,5,B001QOGYFY,I loved this movie and thought it was well down - of course having Beckinsale to look at could have shifted my review to a 5 star...lol..,1520121600,2,137,4.111111111111111
3766741,2,B001QOGYFY,"*** 2 Stars ***  A needless and dull adaptation of a 1998 graphic novel (that wasn't very good to start with.)  Just skip this and watch the ""Fortitude"" series or ""Smilla's Sense of Snow"" - both are excellent and just as icy  Honestly, ""Whiteout"" is simply boring - endless and repetitive scenes of people running and fighting in ... what?  oh yes, 'whiteout' conditions.  You can't see what is going on in about half the flick.  At least the title is honest.  Kate Beckinsale is excellent, when you can see her, but that isn't a reason to waste 101 minutes of your life.  (At least it wasn't for me.)
 Thanks for reading.",1519948800,,622,4.482142857142857
3766742,4,B001QOGYFY,"Brrrrrrrrr.  Start with a cup of hot chocolate and a warm fuzzy blanket to watch this thriller.  This is not a horror flick, but a mystery/thriller at the South Pole.  The scenery is beautiful in a cold sort of way, and it is the cold that is ever so threatening throughout the film.  A ""Whiteout"" storm is due when a dead body is found.  And so begins the story.  With evacuation on the horizon and a newly found buried plane in the snow with some missing cargo, the appearance of a FBI person and an unknown person or persons sneaking around or chasing and killing people in the bitter blizzard cold, who and what would be next.  Certainly kept my interest.  Oh, did I mention the Northern Lights?  Didn't know they also had them at the South Pole.",1519689600,,750,4.3768115942028984
3766743,2,B001QOGYFY,"Strong opening. Cheesy ending. Obnoxious flashbacks.  Too predictable. Unbelievable in that nobody has eyes frozen shut, chapped lips or burned esophagus due to running/fighting in -55 deg Celsius but fingers turn black after a few minutes exposure. Weak writing resulted in all the actors having to work with what was given them. Canada did a good job playing the role of Antarctica.",1518480000,2,384,5.193548387096774

3766746,3,B001QOGYFY,"I rather enjoyed this movie. Most people did not. I am a fan of the comic series by Rucka. The book is better, as is usually the case with adaptations.

The crews are getting ready to move-out due to the winter darkness They discover a body on the ice and start investigating. After another dead body, there's a killer and they the cargo plane's back in play (but what was the plane's cargo?).  Although there are some inaccurate portrayals with the weather and plot holes; I found this to be entertaining and kept me on my toes.

3766989,1,B001QOGYFY,"Boy, where to begin. First of all, the whole story was just poorly served out. People start getting killed in the Antarctic, okay? First murders ever on the world's most forbidding continent. Sound exciting? It would have been if we had any idea who these people were. The ragtag team of a US Marshall, a UN special agent type and a pilot sort of vaguely recognize some of these people from their time working near the South Pole, but to us the characters are basically a bunch of bodies that get found. In the meantime, Kate Beckinsale proves that she has mastered the technique of grunting once ever beat that she's on screen in ever single action scene she has. Oh, don't get me wrong. They're cute, sexy grunts. They just don't give us the sort of awe for the kick ass, quick thinking character Dominic Sena wants us to think she is. Oh, and speaking of sexy, just in case anyone is in doubt at the start of the film as to whether Beckinsale is a smoking hottie, her first appearance is in her skintight underwear, heading toward the shower. She gets her top off, and we get these literally and figuratively very steamy shots of her through the misted glass of the shower stall, and it's a sequence I shall never forget, lech and voyeur that I am, but see, it doesn't actually matter to the film at all.

I like that they answered many of the characters reasons for even being in the Antarctic. Kate is law enforcement at the huge camp.
I guess you could say ""Whiteout"" is ""The Thing"" with human monsters.

It starts with an absurd premise and gets more absurd from there. You know what you're in for when the opening scene tells you you're in Antarctica, the Coldest and Most Remote Land Mass on the Planet---in case you never heard of Antarctica (which is just about the level of education this movie aims at). Then we have a U.Sl marshall assigned to a research station (""to handle misdemeanors""). Never mind that the marshall's service only handles fugitives, witness protection, and seized assets, none of which apply here, but the idea of a law enforcement officer on a research station is ridiculous. It goes downhill from there, with most events either  random or inserted into order to make something happen. Nothing follows logically or naturally. The dialogue is formulaic, about on the level of a low-budget porn film. The movie borrows heavily from The Thing for its atmosphere and attempts at suspense, but is nowhere near as well done (and there's al ow bar to get over).

It wasn't until Netflix recommended it for me and I read the description, that I thought there might be something there. While the previews made it look like some arctic nightmare, the truth is that it was a pretty great film. The story is centered around a U.S. Marshall, stationed at the base in Antarctica. For more than 3 years, she didn't really have much to do, but that all changed when two base members are found murdered. It then becomes Carrie Stetko's job to solve the first murders in the continents history. Despite a lack of other people and places to go, the writers of this film did an excellent job at keeping this movie intriguing. I didn't think in a million years that a film like this would work, but actually it works out really well, and unlike a similar story, Fargo, the producers of Whiteout hold nothing back. Kate Beckinsale stars and really does a fantastic job. I've always like her abilities, not to mention the way she looks, but this film is the first time her performance really stood out to me as something special, maybe she should consider playing a cop more often. As someone who's seen thousands of films, it always amazes me how the films I expect the least from, always deliver the biggest surprises.

Fifty years later, a US Geological Survey team stumbles on the wreckage, and pays for their discovery with their lives. Clearly there is a villain in their midst, but who is it? With the cast wearing full snow gear much of the time, it's difficult to sort out the good guys from the evil-doers. Tom Skerritt as the camp doctor, Dr. John Fury, Gabriel Macht as U.N. Investigator Robert Pryce, and Kate Beckinsale as the star heroine, U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko are all excellent with a quality supporting cast.

3767078,2,B001QOGYFY,"It's an okay detective yarn.  But it would have been more believable with a man playing the sheriff.  A tiny woman in the Antarctic playing Humphrey Bogart is just Hollywood garbage.

Remember, any woman (in real life) in posts like that are for show only.  Because female sheriffs without their posse of men can not long endure.  The same holds true in the military.  Any woman in the military that's a sergeant major is a grandma and looks it.  Can you imagine a military with only women?  The day that happens we'll be invaded almost over night...and deserve it.

Woman police?  Another joke.  Think they can chase down a man by themselves, catch him, subdue him and then finally handcuff'em.  Not gonna happen.  The guy will more than likely be shot--because they know they cannot match a man in hand-to-hand combat.  That's why there are so many people being shot by the police--thanks to the police women.

Please understand; whenever a woman is allowed to join a group that is for very good reasons ""men only,"" the standards have to be changed--and they always go down--never up.  The weakest link is now even weaker.

She, a mediocre actress, was miscast for this part; she has a pretty but common face that I see in the malls on a daily basis.  To make up for the lack of acting, they use her body--for example the unnecessary scene with her showering. What was the point of that?  Believe it or not, the movie actually begins with her going in and taking a shower.  Why?
Who, in their right mind, cares?

Her voice is cold, bland and unmelodic. I wouldn't want to have to listen to that voice day-in and day-out. Where have all the good actresses gone?  All the good ones are either retired or resting in peace.

Tom Skerrit was good; in fact, they should have reversed their roles. He should have played the aging sherrif thinking about retiring and she would have been more believable as the doctor.

3767136,3,B001QOGYFY,"I don't go into a Kate Beckinsale movie looking for riveting writing, masterly directing or breathtaking acting. I go in looking for Kate's latex-clad heinie. Spandex is fine too; I don't want her to grow stale as an actress. That's why I like Kate Beckinsale, she's reliable eye candy. If she wants to learn to act too, that's fine with me, as long as she ""acts"" in movies about sexy, bloodthirsty, smoldering vampires, vampire slayers, werewolves, etc. Butthis movie was just not as good as it could have been Usually I don't judge movies like that, but I kept noting missed opportunites so much that i started to annoy myself. For one thing she's wearing a parka for 90% of the movie, and it's not even a latex parka at that!

As you may already know, she plays a U.S. Marshal who has requested duty in one of the worst law enforcement jobs on Earth, a station in America's Antarctic base. She's done this because she had a bad experience in Miami while working a drug case and is trying to run away from the guilt and feeling of betrayal that arose from that experience. As usual for a movie cop, just a few days before she is about to retire, bodies start to pile up and she has to make one last bust before she can ride off into the sunset.

There are some speed bumps in solving the mystery. A huge storm is a'comin' and if she doesn't solve the mystery before it hits she will be stuck on the base for 6 months during the harsh winter period. Also, there is a masked killer, who looks like any generic masked killer in almost any lower tier thriller, who doesn't want her poking her beautifully tilted nose into his business. And then there's the biggest obstacle, which is the terrible, awful, thoroughly abysmal acting, writing and directing.

The movie has an almost glacial pace. There is little building of suspense, followed by a release, followed by a bigger building of suspense.

When something does happen, you almost don't even care.

Kate's not a bad actress and her character had the potential for some real depth and complexity, the ol' woman running from her demons thing, but Kate doesn't play her that way. As a matter of fact, it seems there were several different currents on the theme of loss here, but none of them were ever explored nearly closely enough, by the actors, writers or directors.

Also, the movie doesn't examine the unique setting of the film enough. A murder mystery at the bottom of the world, the most desolate and extreme environment on our planet should have been more interesting than this, just because of its setting. There are a few decent chases through a blizzard, a frozen cup of coffee and a neat scene involving Kate and frostbite, but the isolation, claustrophobia and pure alieness of the environment aren't elaborated on as much as I'd have liked.

 Maybe someone will re-make this movie in the future and turn it into the good movie it deserves to be, someone who actually wants to make a good movie instead of just play at it.",1354838400,,2989,4.563432835820896

Some of the plot turns are predictable and there's not enough character development, but the spectacular arctic locations and the effective filmmaking compel me to give this 4 stars. Maybe a weak 4 stars, but 4 stars nevertheless.

I said ""arctic locations"" because the film was shot in Manitoba, not Antarctica.

Pay no mind do those who say this is a crappy film. If you're in the mood for a modern Ice stataion Zerbra film with SOME elements of The Thing then Whiteout should fill the bill. It won't blow you away or anything (except maybe an early shot of Kate, lol) but it's a solid arctic mystery-thriller.",1350172800,,1360,6.375

3767143,5,B001QOGYFY,"Do you have a movie that for some reason, is just one of those movies you can watch again and again and never get tired of it? For those of you on both (or the same, whatever) sides who keep slobbering over the shower scene or a loosely draped towel, this review is not for you. I love a good murder mystery and Whiteout, to me, is simply a good murder mystery. I thought Kate Beckinsale did a wonderful job as burned out U.S. Marshall, Carrie Stetko. Obviously stationed in a South Pole U.S. camp, the story opens with her returning from another Marshall duty. She seems tired, run down and just wants a hot shower and some rest. This is not to be, however as she is immediately tasked to investigate a dead body spotted in her jurisdiction. I love movies shot in the beauty and splendor of either poles, anyway. That this turns out to be a pretty good who-done-it is simply an added bonus for me. So far, I haven't read a review here that does this movie justice or one that would make a reader want to see it, so, I'll do my best without spoilers, which isn't easy.

The main characters are Carrie, already listed, a truly great turn by Tom Skerritt as the station's doctor, John Fury, and also honorable mention to Gabriel Macht, now known as Harvey Specter on one of TV's best new shows, Suits, playing UN agent Robert Pryce, who helps Carrie solve the mystery of who, why, when, and where of the dead body and the who-done-it. Also, honorable mention number two goes to Columbus Short (Quarantine, Death At a Funeral) as Delfy, who flies and drives them wherever they need to go.

The movie, despite numerous jokes and put-downs here, has everything a great murder mystery must have to make it fun to watch. Lots of action, a wonderful investigation that leads Carrie and Pryce down some interesting avenues, including a very exciting outdoor chase scene in an arctic snow storm with powerful winds and blinding snow. The ending, which I will not give away so others might find and actually enjoy this little gem of a mystery, is not expected (at least not by me, and I'm pretty good at ""gaming"" murder mysteries).

So, I encourage you to spend an evening, pop some corn, and grab your beverage of choice, kick back and enjoy this sweet little thriller for what it is. A truly terrific story, with great actors, who turn in some great acting. As I said, I still watch this movie every once in a while, when I'm in the mood for a fun ride in a movie that I KNOW is not a waste of time!",1349740800,4,2490,4.396963123644252
3767144,4,B001QOGYFY,"I have been a fan of Kate Beckinsale ever since ""Uncovered"" back in the early 1990s.  She is versatile.  And ever since ""Underworld"", she has widened her range to join the short list of female action stars in Hollywood.  Now, this movie should have done better at the Box Office.  It is a very good movie, with commendable performances from Ms. Beckinsale and Mr. Skeritt (Tom Skeritt).  If you have room in your DVD shelf, this would be a good one to add.

The setting is unusual.  Antarctica!  Yes, everything is all white.  Just watching is enough to make you shiver in your pajamas.  The main character is Carrie Stetko (Beckinsale), a female U.S. Marshall charged with maintaining the peace in a remote multinational research station in Antarctica.  Every year, the station has to be evacuated due to a weather phenomenon known as the ""Whiteout"" which make survival nearly impossible in that part of the continent.  As the station prepares for evacuation, a dead body is discovered.  Stetko and the station's chief medical officer, Tom Skeritt, examines the body. They find evidence of foul play.  With just a few days remaining before the evacuation and a killer on the loose, Stetko is under time constraints to solve the murder.

I must say that Kate Beckinsale deserves to have more starring roles.  I think she has played the role of supporting lady to a leading man like Mark Wahlberg enough times.  Hopefully, she will get more chances to play truly well-written lead characters in future action movies.",1347494400,,1515,4.85546875

3767166,4,B001QOGYFY,"I'm no fan of Kate Beckinsale by any stretch, but this film was on my queue of films that got bad reviews but had a premise that interested me.  So with no expectations at all I started watching 'Whiteout' and was thoroughly entertained by it's characters and deliberate old school thriller pacing.  I don't know who said it, but this film is essentially a western, and looking at it in that light it has alot of strength.  Beckinsale plats US Marshall Carrie Stetko, posted at a US research camp in Anatarctica.  The story concerns a series of murders relating to the mysterious cargo of a crashed Russian plane from the 1950s. Like a western, the main focus of the film is the examination of the character and morals of it's protagonist, who is haunted by the guilt of a murder in self defense she committed. Otherwsie 'Whiteout' is a Mcguffin story, and if you're only interested in ""what's in the box"", you're not going to enjoy this film.  'Whiteout' is about character and setting.  The film had some pleasant surprises for this viewer, in that it was nice to see (for a change) the extreme weather of Antarctica rendered fairly realistically... 100 mph winds, -50 F temps have a visceral, scary, believability.  I was happy there was no throwaway nudity or sex scene, it makes Beckinsale's character stronger.  At one point an escape scene used a bit of realworld hardware that I wasn't expecting.  Most important the climax of the film was not violent, which I think is probably where alot of reviewers got disenchanted with the film, but I found it refreshing that the writer chose to keep the established character relationships intact at the end, rather than throw in some gratuitously sour betrayal scene. This alone made the film special to me, but especially in the context that the film is a WESTERN. I think Beckinsale and the rest of the cast did a great job in their roles. I think if you enjoyed 'Copland' with Sylvester Stallone, you should give this film a look.",1343001600,7,1983,4.69164265129683
3767167,3,B001QOGYFY,"U.S. Marshall, Carrie Stetko (played by Kate Beckinsdale), stumbles upon a murder in Antarctica. After reading the graphic novel I had to admit that some of the fun of the tale was taken away for me, especially as I felt the the latter captured the setting better than the movie. All said, it's a decent story for those who don't wish to track down the graphic novel.

I found the investigation and presentation uneven and certain scenes which should have been milked more were rushed. Ever watch a movie and feel the pacing was just off? This is one of those movies. By the way on the Amazon DVD cover it looks more like Jennifer Aniston than Beckinsdale.

3767168,3,B001QOGYFY,"This movie bombed with the critics and at the box office and I'm not sure why.  Well I get why critics panned the movie.  It's poorly written and not very well acted, but what did the audience expect?  Maybe they were thinking this was another remake of ""The Thing"", I don't know.  Frankly, once you get past the lame writing and lame premise the movie serves pretty well as a murder-mystery-thriller.  Granted I was able to identify the ultimate bad guy but for the usual reason, the other possibility was just too obvious.  Park your brain and just go for the ride; it won't hurt even if you chuckle when you shouldn't.

Kate Beckinsdale was given an opportunity to show offer her acting ability rather than just her body as has been the case in many of her other roles, though near the start of the film she does both. I found myself really feeling her pain and anguish in two key scenes and gained new respect for her talent. The downside to this film is the poor quality of the special effects. In the scene with the man falling out of a window, it looked absolutely terrible, as if the director either didn't care or ran out of money and it couldn't be helped. The flash-back scenes are all quite bad, actually. Fortunately, the rest of the film is believable as there aren't too many special effect scenes. I will be watching it again!

Whiteout started out godawful and never got any better. After a while, it numbed me with a constant barrage of bad: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction. The word stultifying comes to mind. And, in a film of this ""quality"", making me wait 35 minutes for Gabriel Macht to appear is just unforgivable. I knew it would be awful, but the promise of Gabriel Macht gets me to watch some awful movies (I'm looking at you, The Spirit).

3767185,5,B001QOGYFY,This is a good film. I am a huge Kate Beckinsale fan and i believe her performance in this movie was great. This movie was very suspenseful and had many twist and turns. This is a definite buy. I suggest you buy other Kate Beckinsale films because she is a great actress.,1297814400,,271,4.230769230769231
3767186,3,B001QOGYFY,"Amputation is the least of the worries as Kate Beckinsale stars as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. marshal with trust issues - a former partner backstabbed her - who is stationed in Antarctica and nearing her final departure date.  That is, until someone spots a human popsicle in a remote location.  A motley crew of contractors - including Tom Skerritt as a doctor, Alex O'Loughlin and Columbus Short as pilots - get tossed together in order to solve the mysterious death, dodge an ice-axe-wielding killer, and wrap it up in a nice, shiny bow before the last plane leaves and strands the group before a deadly winter storm hits.

Overall, the tension just isn't palpable.  The only time my heart rate raced was the result of Beckinsale's shower scene, not the danger during a whiteout or guideline following action sequences, and the only shivering that occurred was because easily deduced foreshadowing (if you can't figure out who the bad guys are in the film, you're not trying) made the killer as predictable as in an Abraham Lincoln biography.  Make no mistake, Beckinsale's the primary reason to watch this film, because the product is relatively bland, but she's dressed up like Ralphie's little brother Randy in Christmas Story the entire film, and taking her out of those clothes would be even more improbable than keeping her in them.  Dilemma.

I'd give the film an A for effort, considering this subgenre of suspense (i.e. blizzards) really has only been attempted a handful of times before, but effort is not enough, and at no time was the action intense or the storyline completely engaging.  For whatever reason - call it Anglo-inspired culture, language, and legends - but the attempted claustrophobic effect was not as successful as that of a dark cave, murky water, or even pitch-black openness.

Probably the best aspect of this movie was the beautiful display of scenery available at the South Pole; some of the mountainous landscape is jaw-dropping.

3767187,3,B001QOGYFY,"I originally saw this film, about murder and mayhem at a scientific station at the South Pole, on HBO and was a bit disapponted.  I picked it up on blu-ray and watched it again and enjoyed it more the second time.  The film based on a graphic novel is interesting but does have its flaws.  The fight scenes out in the cold are okay, but it is difficult to tell who everyone is and as a result the suspense is diluted.  Furthermore the macguffin of the mysterious cargo that men are dying and killing for is, once revealed, a distinct disappointment.  The sets are very nicely designed and the scenes at the South Pole, (actually filmed at Lake Manitoba in Canada,) are beautiful
But the really most beautiful thing in this film is Kate Beckinsale.  I found her absolutely gorgeous in ""Pearl Harbor.""  My opinion didn't change in the ""Underworld"" films or the disappointing ""Van Helsing.""  I think she is one of the prettiest actresses in films and can even make a burnt-out U.S. Federal Marshal at the South Pole look good.  (The writers obviously knew what their main asset was since they almost immediately have her strip down to take a shower.  No nudity however.) The supporting cast is good  with Tom Skeritt a standout.  Alex O' Laughlin also appears and uses what is probably his normal Austrailian accent.  Watching him in this film makes me realize why I have a hard time accepting him as McGarrett on the new ""Hawaii Five-O.""
The picture and sound quality on the blu-ray are great.  There is a nice documentary on the making of the film (where Beckinsale looks more beautiful than ever.)  There is also a interesting featurette comparing the graphic novel with the completed film.  There are also a couple of fairly long deleted scenes.
As stated, this is a well-made film that kind of came and went in the theaters.  It is not bad and not great, but a fairly enjoyable way to spend an hour and forty minutes.  And, in case I haven't mentioned it, that Kate is soooo beautiful!",1296259200,19,1987,4.596590909090909

By no means a classic like similar movies, Whiteout delivers a good mystery filled with elements of tension, thrills, isolation and fear in which the close quarters and harsh environment establish that there is nowhere to run and yet the setting is such that there are plenty of places the killer could be hiding.

U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) is the lone law enforcement officer present at a remote international science station based in Antarctica.  Surprisingly large and occupied by several hundred staff and researchers, a dead body is discovered in a desolate ice field many miles from the station under bizarre circumstances.  The station is getting ready to shut down early for the winter due to the impending arrival of a huge storm that will soon blanket the area with blizzard like conditions.  Racing against the clock, Carrie finds herself the center of a deepening mystery that involves the murder of another researcher, a ruthless but unknown killer who could be anyone and an abandoned 1957 Soviet cargo plane frozen under the ice in which more dead bodies are discovered.",1284249600,,1309,4.931818181818182
3767194,1,B001QOGYFY,"I knew when the opening scene had Kate Beckinsdale getting into a shower that it was the only thing they could do to get the audience's attention. It's pretty much downhill from there, descending into a TV episode set in snow. Lacking the supernatural element of the almost-as-bad ""The Last Winter"" and trying to salvage the best bits from The Thing and that episode of the X Files set in Alaska, it's a mish-mash of ludicrous plot points and terrible dialog. The best part is when Kate gets two fingers amputated - I never thought I'd say that.

Every twist is signaled from a mile off and there are so many ""why did they do that?"" moments that it robs the picture of any tension, suspense or surprise. Kate B sleepwalks her way through the role and Tom Skerritt is starting to look more like Kris Kristoffersen every day. The whiteout scenes suffer from unnecessary CGI injection, and fail to convey any sense of the beauty of the locale. Then there are endless technical flaws that will have you rolling in the aisles (the wind gives Kate B frostbite in 10 seconds flat but in every scene the character have no face mask and are unaffected).

Warning - spoiler below:

In the final scene, they use batteries from a potentially life-saving radio to escape - when they could have use the ones from a flashlight. Not very likely, methinks.

In addition to the murders, Kate has to battle the elements as well as frequent annoying Miami flashbacks, explained about midway through the movie. I found Beckinsale unconvincing in her role.

Whose the masked guy with the ice axe trying to take your head off? All these and more questions will be answered by the conclusion of the movie. From the cutesy picture on the cover I fully expected some overly cute woman to pander to the camera as she trotted around half naked trying to do a job she was ill suited.

This US Marshal, well played by Kate Beckinsale, is no slouch and she comes complete with a back story as to why she is stationed in such an inhospitable environment.

OK, I'm going to mention the nudity part.  What in the heck did that add to the plot?  Why is it this young lady straps on a gun but would rather run from someone than use it? Does she have no hand-to-hand combat training?  And the whining...",1279152000,2,909,4.160919540229885

3767212,5,B001QOGYFY,"I really enjoyed the movie ""Whiteout"" that is filled with mystery and action, as did my family. It starts with a story a bit similar to a few other movies but keeps you guessing each minute as to who or what the bad guys are.  This movie filled with suspense and action is a favorite of ours.  Well written screenplay and the actors are very believable in their character rolls and portral. The twists and turns leave you wanting more and the ending may surprise most of you. If you like action, mystery, suspense and a sound script with great acting, watch ""Whitout.""

3767214,2,B001QOGYFY,"Bleh, then blah. Kinda knew this was going nowhere when the very first scene with the star has her go straight to her bedroom, slowly disrobe, and then take a long hot shower. Yes, some serious dramatic development going on here.

Rarely have I cared less where a movie was headed. The central mystery is uninteresting, the actors barely decent, the script boring and flaccid, and the main thrills are how cold and windy it is, and shots of frozen corpses, over and over and over. Beckinsale is incredibly uninteresting; I never felt a thing for her character. Ditto everyone else. No character development, no reason to care about anyone. The manipulative, obvious score doesn't help, either. All in all, the only decent things here are the shots of the mountains and the aurora borealis.

It's just a standard murder mystery with no impetus to care about anything. The professional production almost makes it even worse; if this was shot on the cheap it would probably have worked better. Whiteout is a glossy tv-movie, at best.

I would recommend that you run, don't walk, to most any other movie.
There is absolutely no good reason to watch Whiteout....unless you need to get to sleep very quickly.",1277424000,,1202,4.825242718446602
3767215,3,B001QOGYFY,"Carrie (Kate Beckinsale) is a U.S. Marshall with a confidence problem.  She is sent to what should be the most stress-free post there is for the U.S. Marshall's;  Antartica.  As the only law enforcement presence on the continent, Carrie is kind of like a sheriff in a western.  Of course, Antartica is quite a bit bigger (and way more hostile!) than a town in the old west.

Unexpectely, Carrie chances across some ""action"" as the corpse of a murdered man is found out in the middle of the wastelands.  It's up to Carrie to find the murderer, and her investigation untangles an elaborate scheme to smuggle the cargo of a forgotten transport plane out of the country.

One of the most remarkable features of the film (aside from Kate, anyway), is the cinematography.  The filmmakers do a good job of making the austere landscape of Antartica into a bona-fide character in the story.  Some of the visuals are downright stunning and one momentarily forgets that it's the most inhospitable continent on the planet.

Some will notice that nudity is listed as one of the reasons that the film was rated ""R.""  People (like me!) may be curious as to whether Kate is in front of the camera wearing her birthday suit.  The resounding answer is ""NO!""  The movie opens with Kate arriving in Antartica  & stripping down to take a shower, but the camera angles are creative enough so that you don't see anything.  It's a teaser scene that seems to have been thrown in there just to egg-on the viewers who are wondering what sort of ""nudity"" is in the film.  As it turns out, there are some males running around naked outside the compound, and that's it.  <<<<<boring

If you're a fan of Kate (like me!) then this film is worth  watching.  If you're interested in Antartica, this movie is most assuredly worth a looking as it may be decades before another movie has a need to do any filming there.  It's not a great movie, but it is a decent one.  Thankfully, it stayed away from some common horror movie motifs which in the present movie would have been downright silly.

3767216,5,B001QOGYFY,"Being an avid fan of Alex O'Loughlin I waited for several years while the producers of this movie kept changing the opening date.  It was worth the wait because Alex O. never disappoints.

Alex shines as an Australian pilot (we get to hear that wonderful real accent of his), Russell Haden.  I spent some of the movie just waiting for Alex's character to come back on the screen.  When the movie was being promoted, there was something said about Alex running across the ice wearing nothing but a fur hat and boots.  This is one reason why you have to buy the DVD.  It happens so fast in the very beginning, when I saw it in the theater, I was already anxious to get the DVD to use that pause button.  Next comes Alex's acting - splendid - especially in the midst of the rest of the actors in this movie.  Uh, what are their names again?

This movie is based on a graphic novel, and they did a good job putting it on screen.  There is lots of excitement when the ""whiteout"" finally moves in and the killer is revealed.  Very realistic special effects.  The actors said it was very hot working inside with all those clothes on with fake snow blowing around in the whiteout/fight scenes.  You would never know they were not really out there in the sub-zero temperatures.

Another great scene is one where the director let Alex improvise with his natural sense of humor - as he plays bartender for the partying guys at the base, pouring old Scotch over 1,000 year old ice.  Made me want to be there for a shot of that.  Another great scene - where Russell is being interrogated and Kate Beckinsale (ah, I knew I would remember her name eventually...) starts to cut off his thumb.  Very dramatic, and what I love about Alex is that he is so great at playing extrememly different kinds of characters.  Some fans, after seeing him portray Mick on the TV show Moonlight, don't like seeing him play the ""bad guy"".  I love it.  He is so versatile, and yes, that is what acting is all about, but Alex is a cut above the rest.  I have never seen anyone absolutely become their characters like he does - the way he looks, talks, etc.

This is a great thriller, and again, if you are a fan of Alex O'Loughlin, this is a must see.  If you are not a fan of Alex O'Loughlin, you will be by the time the movie is over.",1275004800,,2301,4.3
3767217,2,B001QOGYFY,"There are some interesting visual flourishes in this movie, illustrating it's origins as a graphic novel.  The concept itself is intriguing, using an unlikely location (Antarctica) as a setting for a whodunnit style thriller, with a cast that normally can be relied on to do a decent job.  Alas, the concept starts to weaken on two fronts.. firstly, the treatment of it's star, Kate Beckinsale.  A lengthy introducing tracking shot culimates in an equally lengthy shower scene, which plotwise serves to tell us... well, truthfully it serves no plot purpose at all, other than to have Kate Beckinsale in a shower scene right at the start - perhaps to hook the people that might turn off when they discover she is going to be all dressed up in bulky Antarctic gear for the rest of the movie?  And then secondly, if we are to revel in her acting ability - why then serve her with a script so clunky you have to assume it got frostbite on the way to the location and had its common sense amputated?
The plot is intriguing.. a Russian plane downed in the Cold War carrying a valuable cargo, serves as a prologue to a murder in current day North Pole.  As the Marshall, Kate has to figure it out, but all the suspects are about to leave on the last plane out before Winter sets in.  The setting is particularly cool - (pun intended), with the frigid weather convincingly portrayed for the most part, and some of the frozen beauty of the scenery is striking (actually Canada, not Antarctica, of course).  The whodunit will have you guessing - for at least a few minutes.  For the rest of the movie you'll have to rely on cardboard dialogue and mediocre action scenes.  On the plus side, Tom Skerritt does a good enough job to survive with his dignity intact, and the scenery is good.
I'll applaud the movie for it's original setting, but have to give it a thumbs down in the directing and script department.  I'd stick with the graphic novel.  Interesting idea then, but the end result will likely leave you, well ok, let's say it - somewhat cold.",1274745600,2,2040,4.546448087431694

3767220,4,B001QOGYFY,"""Whiteout"" is a movie I had limited expectations for, mainly because of its confusing ad campaign that was unclear if it was a suspense thriller or a supernatural thriller.  I took a chance on it, mainlt due to the presence of Kate Beckinsale, and wow, I was surprised how strong of a thriller this is.  Set in Antarctica, Beckinsale plays a US Marshall who represents the only law enforcement officer on the continent, which is handy when the first murder in the continent's history takes place.  Many suspects abound, all centering on a crashed freight plane from the 1950s, the contents of which are unclear.  Her only ally is a grizzled doctor and survivalist, played by Tom Skerritt and sn FBI agent flown in at the last minute to help investigate.  Did I mention the handful of occupants left are stranded inside sue to lethally cold temperatures, and there's a storm coming... ""Whiteout"" is the kind of thriller we don't see much anymore. An intelligent, skillfully made, old-fashioned suspenser in the tradition of Agatha Christie.  I was impressed by the film's stress in character and not just the axe-wielding maniac loose in the compound.  It also gave a lot of details about what life is like in the compound, and every time I would ask a question in my mind, the movie would answer it, leaving me satisfied and exhilarated by the time the credits roll.  Beckinsale is terrific.  She looks fabulous, but portrays toughness and vulnerability very well here, expecially when we hear why she chose to police Antarctica.  Tom Skerritt is superb.  He is a great example of an actor who has transitioned from leading man to character actor, and he brings heft and credibility to the proceedings.  The special effects used to create the environment are convincing, and the movie lets the action roll, but doesn't cheat the details.  When our heroine has to have fingers amputated from frostbite, it is clear the rules are different in this thriller.  I strongly recommend this.  Lots of surprises for a thriller we feel like we have seen before.  It reminds me why I enjoyed ""X-Files:  I Want to Believe"".  In that film (also set in a frozen and haunting landscape), the space felt tangible, the characters fully developed, and it didn't go for stupid-ass thrills that are cheap and insulting.  The emphasis on character and detail elevates ""Whiteout"" to a superior thriller and gives the more expected chases, carnage, and action scenes more credible.

Framed in a very cinematic 2:40, the blu-ray transfer looks amazing.  The detail in the compounds are shown down to the finest chips of paint.  Nice VC-1 1080p tranfer boasts terrifc detail, contrast and color saturation.  The effects look great even under the scrutiny of high def.  The sound is a robust Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless endcode.  The storms, plows, plane crashes, and music are all superb, plenty of bass to shake the house, with crisp dialogue reproduction.  SD cannot render the detail on a movie like this with shadowy contrast and stark whites.  The BD covers it beautifully.  Highly recommended.  The movie is excellent if you are a fan for old-school thrillers.",1274227200,4,3139,4.892045454545454

3767224,4,B001QOGYFY,"You always get a potential mixed bag when comics are adapted to the silver screen. Not everything done in a comic can translate to the screen and vice versa. And creative liberties are almost always used in excess, when compared to the actual source material. Fortunately, such is not the case for ""Whiteout."" The story revolves around a female US Marshall named Carrie Stetko (very well played by actress Kate Beckinsale), as she is forced to investigate a murder on an Antarctic base, just days before the long six month winter, and a powerful whiteout storm, is about to hit.

This dramatic ""whodunit"" mystery starts off on a slow burn, but yet it never feels like it is dragging. As the body count rises, the puzzle sucks you in, not just about the murders and why they are happening, but about Carrie's own past that has brought her to this desolate wilderness. Tom Skerritt is good as the comforting doctor, while Gabriel Macht is passable as the slick Government agent. But the film almost totally rests on Kate Beckinsale's role. She makes it believable, not only through her no-nonsense attitude on the job, but through the more vulnerable parts, as the painful secret she's been running from is revealed. In some ways she's as cold and dead inside, as the environment surrounding her is outside. You develop a real empathy for her character and it sucks you right into what is happening around her. Beckinsale literally carries the main emotional thrust of the film single-handed, but she does so quite well.

The cinematography is also extremely strong. The sweeping landscape shots easily convey the beauty and vast emptiness of the region. The dangers of those who would seek to dwell in such a place feels quite real. There are a few times, though, where the atmosphere of a terrain so hostile to human life isn't necessarily portrayed accurately, but they don't really detract that much from the film, as if you are already invested in Carrie and the mystery, you probably won't even notice them. Also, one of the red herrings on who is behind the killings is hammered on a little too often, which makes you know that person can't be the one, but that is a small quibble in an otherwise nice and taut mystery.

Having read the graphic novel the film is based upon, I already knew who is ultimately behind the murders, but it was still a real treat to watch it unfold. For those who haven't read it, I think this film will give you the kind of intelligent thriller fans of this genre of film enjoy. Don't listen to all the haters and give this film a shot.

But in WHITEOUT, she seems detached and uninterested like she really did not want to make this movie.

The scenery was very nice and the set-up to the story was well done.

But 20 minutes into the movie, something falls apart.

The whole plot reveals itself and they pretty much give away the whole scheme and the principle players behind it.... so for the rest of the movie you are sitting waiting for the ending that you already know is coming.

As a result the movie has no life or energy, it just plods along and goes thru the motions.

This happens every so often.  You have a healthy budget, good location, a good basic premise for a story and a collection of fine actors ........ all great ingredients ............ but sometimes the ingredients don't result in a satisfying dish.

Walk into a freezer and sit there for a couple hours.  It'll be more entertaining and less painful than Whiteout.

Predictible, uncreative, unresearched, inconsistent...  Kate Beckinsale IS hot, but her performance was unconvincing.  I'm a US Marshall, but every time I see a dead guy I have a flashback every five minutes - her character was sent to Antartica for a REASON -> that reason is because she's S-T-U-P-I-D.

""Is it possible for ANY surgeon or medical person to have been trained to give stitches in the same manner?""  ""Why does my kitties breath smell like kitty food?""

3767242,2,B001QOGYFY,"""Whiteout"" is directed by Dominic Sena based on a graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber and adapted by four other people. In all this mess, it is clear that the suspense and energy of the original version was lost along the way leaving us with a very cold, seemingly unoriginal movie.

Kate Beckinsale stars as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. Marshal stationed at Antarctica for some reason. A murder is discovered shortly before six months of darkness oncoming and no one will be able to leave. She has an obligatory shower scene where you get to see a lot of skin before she bundles up in heavy sweaters and parkas for the other 130 minutes.

Everything that was scary and suspenseful about this idea in ""30 Days of Night"" failed to be captured here. People are so hindered by the wind and snow that they can barely attack each other. They are so bundled up, you can't tell who is the good guy and who is the bad guy while they badly fight each other. Inbetween short bursts of action, there is a considerable amount of down time where characters talk quietly to each other about their feelings and flashbacks. I really didn't feel that the set up for WHY Carrie was in Antarctica was really so important that it overshadowed the current crime! There's a murder and I don't get as much of a sense of urgency to finding the killer. It might determine whether they will be stuck in this cold dark place all winter and I feel like people drag their feet a little.

Action! Drag, drag, drag. Skirmish! Drag, drag, drag, drag. Surgery! Drag, drag, drag. Get my point?

Kate Beckinsale is a pretty girl, but she is much better suited for the Underworld movies and general rom-coms. I just don't see her as a marshal. She just doesn't look like she can kick butt unless we know she has supernatural powers. She might have abs but she's still so skinny she looks like she could be broken in half. She is NOT Michelle Rodriguez on the bad-ass girl scale.

Only pick up this thriller as a rental if almost all other new releases are gone already. And you'd be better off with ""30 Days of Night"" if you want to experience the graphic novel feel, the scary coldness of that type of climate, and have suspense and action worth watching!",1269129600,4,2222,4.463054187192118

3767268,3,B001QOGYFY,"Filmed in Manitoba and Quebec, the relentless ice, wind, and snow in this film didn't all have to be computer-generated. This film is supposed to be set in a research station at the Antarctic. There's a lot of blizzard here as people struggle hand-over-hand, holding onto the lifelines strung between buildings. Losing one's grip on those lines could mean death. It's possible to become disoriented just a few feet from one's destination in the blinding snows.

But death also comes from more sinister sources in this film. A mangled body is found out on the lonely stretches beyond the compound. Then the homicidal attacks strike closer to home - inside the station itself. Could these attacks somehow be connected to the airplane crash we see in the opening scene of the film? We're immediately plunged into the killing coldness of the Antarctic with a flashback to that 1950's Soviet plane crashing into the wasteland with almost as much impact as the train wreck recreated so dramatically in the movie ""The Fugitive.""

Kate Beckinsale plays a U.S. Marshall assigned to enforce the law at this outpost. Her tour of duty has so far involved her in nothing more serious than the theft of one scientist's illicitly grown marijuana buds. But once the murders start, all her skills are tested. Her suspicion that the current murders might indeed be related to that decades old, cold war crash seem as if they might be confirmed.

Mostly, we've seen this all before. Someone, or something, is running amok in the eerie isolation of an ice station. However, there are a few elements that distinguish this film. For one thing, after appearing in an early completely gratuitous cheesecake scene as she steps into a bath - Kate Beckinsale steps into a more serious role and is shown fighting on a par with the men at the station. Even in this day and age, it's rare to see a woman cast in a role of such casually assumed equal or even superior authority - a role in which she doesn't gain her stature through the height of her stiletto heels. Beckinsale remains pretty well bundled up most of the time, which might account for her not being confined to just a series of poses in superficial appearances.

I agree with another reviewer, the film is entertaining up to a point.  The ""cold weather"" is a character itself in the film, since many dramatic scenes take place outside.  These are filmed very well by the director.

I liked the first ""2 reels"" of the film (the first hour)...by the 3rd reel (last 30 minutes) the plot starts to feel forced, and the ending was anti-climatic.",1267401600,,643,4.862385321100917

3767272,4,B001QOGYFY,"The studios seemed unsure on how to market this movie and the punchline of being the coldest movie ever filmed hardly inspired confidence in the Antarctica-set thriller and the movie quickly vanished from movie screens. That it did not get an audience could also be explained by the fact that the film never quite identified itself in its marketing material. Was it a paranormal thriller? Was it a horror movie? Was it a psychological thriller? The truth be told it was none of these and was probably closest in structure and narrative to a western.
The plot revolves around a research station in the Antarctic that is prepping for a hibernation period where a skeleton crew keep things runnning through the Antarctic winter. A body is discovered on the ice and it is down to a U.S. Marshall (played competently by the always watchable Kate Beckinsale) to piece together the mystery of precisely what happened. The mystery is tied to a missing Cold War era Soviet Union plane that crashed into the ice decades earlier, which is shown as the movie opens, and the mysterious cargo on board.
Many complained that the movie makers covered the lithe, beautiful Beckinsale in many layers, but this criticism was hardly a valid one. The star strips down to her underwear within moments of her appearance on the screen but the scene is not gratuitous and is not graphic. For the rest of the movie necessity has her all bundled up but this is in keeping with the nature of the frigid weather which is a character unto itself in the movie. One quickly understands why the movie is set in the Antarctic for the movie uses the inhospitable climate as a mechanism with which to ratchet up the suspense and claustrophic feeling of the production.
Overall a satisfying thriller that surprised me in how much I liked it. I had expected to be bored by it but found myself entertained.",1266710400,51,1867,4.712538226299694

3767286,4,B001QOGYFY,"While this is far from a perfect film, it is a very competently managed thriller.

The weaknesses in the story come from the narrative itself. Much (though not all) of the ""whodunit"" aspects are fairly predictable.

However, stories like this are less about the story and more about the mood, atmosphere and scene. This is a point that Raymond Chandler made in his essays on detective fiction. (Chandler, if you don't know -- and, if you don't know, then you really need to take yourself out behind the woodshed and give yourself a substantial smacking -- Chandler was one of the best writers of detective stories ever; but even beyond that, he was a substantially better essayist on the genre.)

So the real interest of this film is seeing a fairly ordinary detective story transplanted to such an inhospitable scene as the South Pole. Quite aside from the really disturbing possibilities this opens up and explores, this also touches (albeit, only *touches*) on some interesting existential themes as well. Such themes are ""meat and potatos"" of the genre, which this setting allows to come out quite beyond the surfaces of the story telling itself.

Altogether, an interesting piece to watch.",1266192000,2,1194,4.955
3767287,2,B001QOGYFY,"For many of you who don't know, the film WHITEOUT is based on an excellent graphic novel by the very talented Greg Rucka (who can do great things with strong female leads, as he also shows in his series ""Queen and Country"") and artist Steve Lieber. The book is more suspenseful and character-oriented than going from plot-point to plot-point. Yes, there is a view of Carrie Stetko (played by the beautiful and talented Kate Beckinsale, who unfortunately doesn't have much to do here) and her traumatic past, but there are far too many contrivances that exist in the film that were obviously added to make this a faster-paced B-movie thriller. The book actually has a sequel, called MELT, and if you've read both, you can see how they took elements of the sequel and supplanted them into this film. Firstly, the book takes place at a time (and I don't know if things have changed, treaty-wise, in Antarctica) where guns are not legal to carry, law enforcement or not. But how can you make a good American thriller without a gun? Apparently the studio and high-octane action director Dominic Sena (GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, SWORDFISH) didn't think so. They also thought that by giving this film a handsome male protagonist in Gabriel Macht's character was a good idea too, other than using the original female character from the book.

There are some moments in this film that are so traditional Hollywood makeover moments that it just makes me angry. Big planes crashing; big gun fights onboard big crashing planes; a potential romantic-interest hunky leading man other than a smart and capable woman; and the obligiatory ""I'm going to get naked and have a steamy shower on screen for NO APPARENT REASON, but I'm completely covered by clever camera angles and a steamy shower, so, sorry but no nudity"" scene. Wake up, Hollywood... either have the nudity, or don't have the scene. It's just so cliched and so incredibly unnecessary in a film like this.

Now some of the moments they did keep from the book, like the outside sequence in which Carrie is being pursued by the killer and she has no gloves... well, that scene works very well. The frostbite scene with Beckinsale and Tom Skerritt also works very well dramatically. Those few scenes save this film from being a total failure. But then there are scenes in which the three leads are trapped in a very deep ice hole... now, you'd think that would be EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING for these people, but they don't seem very scared at all. There's no drama pushing this scene forward into a tension-filled moment. Or maybe it's just part of their training as their respective professions to just accept that Antarctica will kill you. Oh, well.

Another sad thing is that I like a lot of the people in the film. Beckinsale is fortunately/unfortunately being pigeon-holed into the strong female action lead, thanks to the success of the UNDERWORLD films, and I love her. She's sexy and strong and everything that Hollywood wants in a female lead... for action films. But she is capable of so much more and I hope she ends up taking on some more challenging projects. And the story of the book is, for the most part, up there on screen. It just lacks all of the necessary gravitas to elevate this film from a C-grade action-thriller to a A-Grade dramatic thriller.

Perhaps if they had concentrated more on the story and less on trying to make it sellable to the action-thriller market, it would have been a more successful film, both story-wise and money-wise. Hollywood must stop underestimating viewers some day because they've proven don't have to. They can make smart action films and smart thrillers because the better something is, the more people will see it. But perhaps what makes those great films so great is because they come from genres that are unaccustomed to greatness. Who knows?",1266019200,,3837,4.800302571860817

I just wish Alex would have played a bigger part in the movie.  Although hearing him use his true accent was a bonus.

The movie is not one of my favorites; my favorites leave me saying wow at the end and still trying to sort through some key details after the movie is over.  It is a simple plot that Kate's character unravels rather quickly, but it does leave you wondering which one of the characters is going to turn out to be the villian in the end.  This is probably one of the biggest mysteries of the movie.  The writer does a good job of pointing you in several directions, using the main character's uncertainty from her past, and leaving you wondering which character is trustworthy enough to be her trusted companion clear to the end.

3767299,2,B001QOGYFY,"2 of 5 stars for the suspense movie Whiteout. This is a very odd movie. After watching the movie and the behind-the-scenes materials I was left with two words: ""Just Because"". When I was a kid and was asked why something happened, I'd answer ""Just Because"". The movie opens with a flight over Antarctica by a Russian crew in 1957. They appear to have a special cargo and the flight crashes. At the end, when you learn of the cargo, just say ""Just Because"". In modern times, we have the arrival of a US Marshal assigned to the US base in Antarctica. Why? ""Just Because"". The movie morphs into a suspense movie with people who get killed by a masked person with an ice axe. Why? J.B. We learn a bit about the lady Marshal but none of it appears to help the plot. Why waste our time? J.B. We eventually tie together the Russian cargo with the murders and are left with the feeling ""Who Cares"". The whole movie is set against the coming winter in Antarctica which often has ""Whiteout"" conditions. Why set in Antarctica? Just Because. In the behind the scenes, we learn this movie was adapted from a ""Graphic Novel"" (comic book) which explains why the plot seems weak. Listening to those who made the movie, they wanted to combine their idea of the lady marshal and the conditions in Antarctica. Now you see why I think the whole movie is lashed-together with ""Just Because"".

The bright spot in this movie was Kate Beckinsale and also the location filming in northern Canada. Tough conditions to make a movie. Too bad it didn't have a better payload for the viewer. So, to be clear, a well made movie with good acting and production values. The weakness was the story that hung-together with magic ""Just Because"" glue. As a suspense thriller, it was fair.

I found Whiteout to be a pretty good murder mystery, quite intense at times - had me on the edge of my seat and my heart pounding - with enough fun and funny moments to break up the tension.  In other words, my kind of film.  Unlike so many movies I've seen, I was not able to figure out the identity of the probable killer/killers.  I even changed my mind several times and still got it wrong!  I also liked that Kate B, as the FBI agent, was not all macho but was instead more of a real person.  It seemed to me that she chose her current desolate post perhaps in a futile attempt to hide away from a past mistake that still haunts her, and has caused her to doubt her ability to accurately judge the true nature of others.  This self doubt crosses that boundary between actor and viewer and causes the audience to doubt her as well.  We are lead to draw on our own deductive skills.  Needless to say, mine are apparently not as good as I thought they were. :o)  Yep...I believe Whiteout was worth buying.",1264204800,4,1179,4.195555555555556
3767301,5,B001QOGYFY,"Mark my words.  Anyone who gives this film a poor review ought to be examing themselves.  How much society and all it's current ills have made them immune to tension and violence.

For ""White Out"" is an intense thriller.  Within the first 15 minutes I thought I had guessed who the ""bad guy"" was but the rest of the film set about disproving my hunch again and again.  All the while entertaining me with eye popping scenes that were believable and again and again completely surprising.

A constant fight against the elements is an underlying and ever present theme of this film.  In that respect it is supernatural.  Those wide open spaces indifferent to our survival and able at times to reach out and snuff out life at a whim.  How much more supernatural do viewers want this film to be?

Then there are the confrontational scenes between characters all of which I nearly held my breath while viewing and wondering who would win.  How much more violence or gore do viewers want?

This is a nice and tight directed detective thriller.  As such it is much better than the two most recent very disappointing detective thrillers made by those awesome actors Pacino and DeNiro.  A believable story right from the start and not the story you think it is.  Yet another big surprise guaranteed to entertain.

The scenery and sets are well put together and except for some scenes I watched and wondered what was blue screen and what was filmed on site somewhere.  But that is an issue with all films today.  As such, scenery and sets were 100% believeable.

The supporting actors, and there were many in this film, were all excellent and contributed to the whole story.  They played their parts perfectly.  The main actors, and there are several, were so good I finished that film with the thought I had just escaped the woes of this world for 2 hours and felt reinvigorated.  In other words, such good acting by the main stars that one is drawn out of oneself completely and into the story on the screen.

I think this film like others in it's genre will improve over the years.  We have several films set in far off icy cold places and they all have one thing in common.  They are better liked years after they came out than when they previewed.  ""White Out"" will most likely fall in that category for some viewers.

For others like me, we will recognize at once a cracker jack good story that keeps one on the edge of the seat, unless you've spent years wallowing in film gore that is, and is thoroughly entertaining throughout.

Bravo for Beckinsale or however one spells her name.  She did a grand job.  Simply grand.

A great film.  Great acting all around.  A great story that keeps you guessing.

Like I said, what do people want?  Better that negative viewers take a long look at their film tastes and try to re-edit the more violent or trite movies from their own lists.  When one watches truly awful films that soak up blood and guts or the dumbest things one can dream up or both, one really does lose the ability to see something perfectly entertaining.

""White Out"" is perfecting entertaining.  That is what popular film was about for decades.  I am happy to see some still think entertaining is a good thing.",1264118400,11,3217,4.5576923076923075

My wife and I and our two Greenland Huskies had lived in the Alaskan Arctic for quite a while, and well this might feel like home. But about 10 minutes into it, we found problems on almost every front.

For example, when there is a wind chill of 80 to 100 below, you don't warm up a plane for a few minutes and zoom off. The same with surface vehicles --which you never turn off unless you have plug in heaters, etc.

And the movie falls into the same trap of most polar-type movies --you can't bundle up a star and then have them toss off their hood here and there, just for a camera shot.

Even with all that, it seemed like the story itself might carry the day. But about halfway in, it seemed like more fun to go outside with a dog for fresh air.

The picture clarity is decent during the non-motion interior shots, but the majority of movement scenes are either out of focus or non-reference. The exterior CGI scenes (almost all of them outside of the several flying scenes) have prevalent green-screen lines and the lighting makes for an obvious stage set. Try not to look in any of the goggles because they usually give away most scenes (sun reflections during whiteouts, etc.) and try to ignore the makers' attempts at keeping the audience aware of Kate's face in the snow (one scene shows hot coffee instantly freezing but she can keep her face unprotected in the same whiteout/scene for a few minutes). The TrueHD gets used intermittently during wind storms and the one crash sequence shootout and landing. The supplements are average and include:

* Coldest Thriller Ever, 12:02 minutes. Covers the filming locale in Canada and how cold it was on set. Kate looked beautiful in her interviews, was almost a before/after contrast between the film and here.
* Storyboard to screen, 12:05 minutes. Not a fan of this one but if you like the board docus you will dig this.
* Deleted scenes, totals 4:14 minutes. Would have helped with two of the 40 plot holes this film had, especially at the Russian Base and her day to day investigations she talked about.
* Disc 2 is the Dig Copy, for Windows and Mac (except in Mexico)..?

Not a recommendation for Blu or for the movie, and being there are only three or four points of landscape clarity - could only give this a few stars.",1263686400,4,2032,4.576923076923077
3767329,1,B001QOGYFY,"I've always wondered, ""Is it ever possible for a movie about a serial killer in the Arctic to be so slow and boring?"" And that is what I beg of you to ask yourself before even touching this movie in any shape or form- I mean, I have seen tons of slow movies about serial killers in the past that I have enjoyed immensely. The Silence of the Lambs, Zodiac, and Se7en moved at unbearably slow paces yet I enjoyed them and found them interesting. I am also not afraid to admit I enjoyed the first three Saw movies immenesely- Hell, the second movie works its best as a cracking little crime drama. The best part of the movie, without a doubt, is the conversation between John and Eric- the chemistry is beautiful! It's like they admire each other, yet simultaneously hate each other too.

Unfortunately, I am afraid that be not the case with ""Whiteout"".

Whiteout was based on a graphic novel of the same name. I have not read it, but I am certainly not doubting that it is better. There have been quite a few graphic novel adaptations this year- Watchmen seen through the eyes of Zack Snyder, the recent Surrogates, etc. And I LOVE graphic novels. I read Watchmen three times- it really is that great. Just this past Christmas I got ""V For Vendetta"", which inspired the movie of the same name. I must say that Watchmen is probably the best film adaptation of a comic book ever- It follows the book VERY closely and doesn't change anything majorly. I've heard from fanboys of the Whiteout graphic novel that this strays too far from it, and I'm not surprised

Basically this movie is about a young woman named Carrie Stetko, who is stationed in Antarctica. It is her last three days in Antarctica, and she is just bringing things to a closure. However, things get complicated when a corpse entombed in ice shows up, and basically the same thing keeps happening, almost like a groundhog day loop. Furthermore, there is a huge ice storm coming, and if she doesn't solve this mystery, she'll be like all the others in the ice desert of nowhere.

For the first time in my reviewing career, I am baffled. I'm sitting here with basically nothing to summarize. You notice how short the summary I put was? That's basically only what I could remember. This review is taking me an hour, basically since NOTHING happens. Better than 50% of the movie is shots of the backs of people's heads, which got really distracting after 20 minutes. The other 50% is made up of 25% of Kate Beckinsale running around in a parka, 20% shots of Antarctica and 5% of any real action whatsoever. When something happens, you're so bored you can't even tell that something's happening.

I'm not saying I hate slowly paced movies. If anything, some of the movies I absolutely love move are painfully slow. But compared to those ones, Whiteout is like a two hour joke without a punchline, with so little to do but so much to say. I'm pretty sure the author of the GN is going all Alan Moore on everybody right now involved with the project. I be not surpised if he was.

IN TOTAL:

Entertainment: 2/10- I stayed through the whole movie. Ph33r my l33r st4y1ng pow3rzzzz :P
Sex: 1/10
Violence: 2/10. I'm actually kinda shocked I'm grading this movie on anything like that because hardly anything happens... ever.
Runtime: I want those two hours back!!!!
Shots of the backs of people's heads: There's tons of them. Actually, this movie should be called ""A Mystery Including The Backs of People's Heads in the Arctic""
Litres of Tomato Ketchup: No tomatoes were harmed in the making of this movie

3767330,3,B001QOGYFY,"WHITEOUT

STARRING: Kate Beckinsale, Tom Skeritt, Gabriel Macht and Columbus Short

WRITTEN BY: Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, Chad Hayes and Carey Hayes; based on the graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber

DIRECTED BY: Dominic Sena

Rated: R
Genre: Thriller
Release Date: 11 September 2009

The problem with movies like Whiteout is if you've seen too many `Who done it' thrillers and if you've seen too many `Snow' thrillers; then you pretty much know what to expect.

You know that there is going to be a storm. You know that the characters are going to be isolated by this storm and that transportation and or communication will not be an option.

You know that there is going to be a guy who will be close to the heroine but may have something to hide, so he could be the guy doing the killing. You know there is going to be a funny guy who is a little too funny, so he could be doing it. You know there is going to be a guy that seems way too much like the guy who's doing it, so he obviously can't be the guy doing it. And you know there is going to be a guy who is good looking, seems genuine, but also has something to hide, so he may be doing it.

Whiteout encases these lovely clichs, and plenty more. There's even a scene where three characters leave a perfectly good Snow-dozer to `investigate' a mysterious patch of ice and one of them - you guessed it - falls in. Then, there's no way the other two would follow that person down into the hole right? But they would and they do and of course snow caves in, leaving them trapped because they didn't think to tell anyone where they were going!

Kate Beckinsale plays U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko. Following a traumatic experience at her previous station in Miami, she has requested to finish her final days at a quiet post in Antarctica. We learn all of this in a series of flashbacks fed to us in teaspoons throughout the course of the film. We also know that several years ago a Russian plane crashed carrying something valuable and landed near Carrie's new post.

It was supposed to be quiet and nice for her and is; until she finds the first dead body. Then a killer shows up dressed like the killer from Urban Legend and tries to kill everyone; obviously related to the Russian cargo of the crashed plane.

As painfully predictable as the movie is at times, it is different from your typical thriller as well. For instance, there are several intense moments outside in the blizzard, where the characters are fighting for their lives. You realize, `Wow, it would really suck to be in that situation'. The storm is insane and chaotic and was done pretty well with CGI (computer graphic imagery). And the ending was very different and not at all what you would expect it to be. I was very pleased by it.

I enjoyed Beckinsale's performance a great deal; especially in her emotional scenes. You really do believe that something traumatic happened to her.

I never get tired of watching Tom Skeritt on film. He brings so much to his characters and you can't help but like him; even if you're not supposed to.

The chemistry between Beckinsale and Skeritt's characters was astonishing. They play old friends who trust each other and enjoy the company of one another, probably more than they do of anyone else stationed at the base. Neither one of them belongs there; they are just at points in their lives that have led them there and we believe it.

Overall, the film was entertaining. Predictable at times yes; but different in others. I just wish there was more suspense. Some scenes seemed to drag on a little longer than they should without something startling happening.

And I have to say that I feel the director (Dominic Sena) could have done a lot more with the film. After all, he did direct two of the best action thrillers ever made: Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish. I guess they can't all be winners.",1261180800,,3878,4.4950213371266
3767331,2,B001QOGYFY,"If you like beautiful Kate Beckinsale, you may like her latest effort ""Whiteout."" But if you are looking for a great thriller (whatever your definition of ""great"" is), sorry, you don't find one here. I thought the film's premise about a dead body in Antarctica was promising and would offer at least something original. No, whoever wrote the screenplay (four writers are credited), they only came up with a plot that remains generic and below-average throughout, just like that of a badly-written straight-to-DVD thriller.

In the new Dark Castle/Warner thriller ""Whiteout"" Kate Beckinsale plays Carrie Stetko, a US marshal stationed at American Antarctic base. She has been here for the past two years, and the tired marshal is about to leave the outpost for good when a dead body is found at the most remote site of the continent. This could be the first-ever homicide case in Antarctica, and Carrie is immediately sent to the scene, where she and Robert Pryce (Gabriel Macht), an operative from UN, discover something unusual deep in the ice.

Actually, it is nothing unusual or surprising for those who have seen the film from the beginning. Despite occasional actions and flashbacks that suggest Carries' traumatic past, ""Whiteout"" remains very dull. The film's clich-ridden story moves at a snail's pace and works neither as thriller nor as drama. Columbus Short and Tom Skerritt appear as pilot and doctor respectively, but except one lengthy operation scene, they (and other supports) are just ciphers. Perhaps to say ""ciphers"" is not enough because during the ""action"" scenes, with heavy blizzard and thick overcoats, we often cannot tell who is chasing who, or simply what is going on.

Sometimes it seems the director (Dominic Sena, ""Swordfish"") is not really interested in the thriller he is supposed to tell. Things often happen and end abruptly. No attempt is made to build up the tension and even the Canadian location (the film was shot in Manitoba and Quebec) doesn't look attractive enough. And as to the star Kate Beckinsale, yes, she does her best, but the fact only makes me feel that her efforts surely deserve far better.",1257033600,4,2144,5.01685393258427
3767332,2,B001QOGYFY,"I've been hearing about this movie for many years. It's an adaptation of a little known graphic novel and it was in pre-production for almost a decade. Reese Witherspoon was initially attached to this project. Reese as a federal agent is an even more ridiculous thought than Kate Beckinsale in the finished product. The buzz for this film turned bitter and hopeless as it was postponed again and again. Finally seeing the film, you get exactly what you expect. An interesting premise of a lone law enforcement officer stuck on the most remote continent on the planet having to capture a killer who has just committed the first murder in the history of Antarctica. Solid premise leads to lame results. First off we do not need any of these flashbacks to flesh out Kate's character and her past in Miami. Totally irrelevant to waste time on this. Second of all there are no compelling villains here, there is basically just a bare bones plot about capturing some killer lurking amidst the snow and ice. There is nothing supernatural or extraterrestial here either, so forget about that.

Some of the photography is lovely, especially the shots that don't rely too heavily on computer generated imagery to stress the fakery of this whole enterprise. Kate does an admirable job with the limited material. The shower scene was totally gratuitous. The best thing about making a movie set in Antarctica and starring an attractive woman is the perverse pleasure a director can take in having the female lead walk around in heavy coats and sweaters, never showing any skin much to the chagrin of teenage boys. Unfortunately this director just couldn't resist one short shower scene. You don't even see anything, it's merely an acknowledgement of hey, there's a woman in this movie, let's shamelessly give her a shower scene.

I enjoyed Tom Skeritt's presence in the film as he gives it more dignity than it deserves. There is one really good scene between him and Kate. I won't spoil it for you but there's real emotion in it. It involves some frostbite and a medical procedure.

Well, too bad. Another film with a cool premise, great setting, a good female lead and some solid photography passes through the Hollywood junk machine and comes out as a disposable product. Filmgoers passed on this and with good reason. ""Whiteout"" will find some kind of small audience as a DVD rental or on late night television in the future.",1256774400,6,2416,4.830917874396135
3767333,3,B001QOGYFY,"""Whiteout"" is an implausible but enjoyable thriller set at the South Pole.  In its opening sequence, set in 1957, a Soviet cargo plane carrying a mysterious cargo goes down somewhere in Antarctica.  In the present, the Amundsen-Scott Scientific Station at the South Pole is preparing to rotate out its summer crew and batten down for the winter darkness, just ahead of an approaching storm.  US Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) is preparing to depart, along with her doctor friend (a grizzled but amiable Tom Skerrit).

The discovery of a body on the ice triggers an investigation that leads in short order to an old Soviet scientific station, another dead body, a killer, and the Soviet cargo plane, minus its mysterious cargo.  Stetko is assisted in her investigation by the doctor, an aircraft pilot (Columbus Short) and a UN Security Officer (Gabriel Macht).  The group, almost inevitably, becomes trapped in an evacuated station with the killer or killers.

Stetko, traumatized by betrayal in a previous assignment told in flashback, finds she can't trust anyone in her present.  The action sequences inside and outside the station work well, moving the audience quickly past some plot holes and cold weather implausibilities to a twisty ending.  ""Whiteout"" isn't going to win any awards, but manages to be moderately entertaining.  Canada does stand in for the Antarctic with some stunning exteriors.",1253318400,30,1413,5.212389380530974
3767334,4,B001QOGYFY,"This movie was better than I had expected. At times it seems like an action film, then switches to suspense, and then it goes to a type of slasher film! Everybody does an awesome job, especially the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who stars as a U.S. deputy marshal named Carrie Stetko who is assigned to solve a murder in Antarctica within three days before the antarctic winter begins. I loved all the beautiful scenery that took place at night, and the big snowstorm. Carrie and her crew soon find a Russian plane that has been hidden in the snow for 50 years, which holds something worth killing for.
