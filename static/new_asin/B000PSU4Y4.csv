Part of this new growth involves understanding what personal relationships are, how to become a part of one, how to walk away from one and how to tear one asunder.

8193211,5,B000PSU4Y4,"Maid in Sweden is arguably the film debut of 1970s sexploitation and big-bust print and film icon Kristina Lindberg. One version goes that Kristina Lindberg was a student in Stockholm and working as a part-time model to help pay her tuition when her photograph, published in a Swedish magazine, brought her to the attention of the producer of Maid in Sweden. Her screen test was so successful that she was immediately signed for the film's leading role, that of an innocent young girl who leaves her rural home to spend a weekend in Stockholm where she has a series of romantic adventures as she discards the frustrations of her small-town environment.

The plot as described by one enthusiastic Kristina Lindberg fan - When innocence is confronted by unthinking passion, it is inevitably tarnished. Such is the poignant story of lnga-a sensitive and tasteful portrayal of a young pretty girl who discovers that life is not a large home in the country with school every day, and an occasional movie with her boyfriend. Inga goes to Stockholm to spend a weekend with her older sister, Grete. She is shocked to discover that Grete and her boyfriend, Casten, are living together and that she is expected not only to accept the situation, but also join in hiding it from her parents. That night, Inga dreams of being picked up by a Lesbian and of an attack by a group of young toughs. Her very first night out in Stockholm, her date, a friend of Grete's takes full advantage of her naivet, and lnga loses her virginity to him. Afraid and ashamed to tell her sister what has happened, but eager to see Bjorn again, she arranges to meet him secretly. She returns to Grete's apartment both physically and mentally exhausted. The next day, her last in Stockholm, as she prepares to go home, Casten, who has been suspicious of her activities all weekend long, intrudes while she is bathing. After weak protests, she lets herself be seduced by her sister's boyfriend. Inga then returns home to her parents, having gained more experience than she should; being forever changed by the harshness of her exposure to life.",1183420800,3,2107,4.788461538461538
