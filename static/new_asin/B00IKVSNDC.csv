8643174,5,B00IKVSNDC,"I 1st saw this movie on "" You Tube "" and loved it so much that I ordered it here on Amazon. This movie is not "" Digitally Remastered!"" There are some parts in the movie where you can't see a certain actor, because it's to dark. Helena B Carter and Marcus Gilbert are both "" Brillilant !"" In this movie. I wish there was a remake of "" Hazard of Hearts "" and stars both actors in different roles. It's a cute romantic 18th century movie and I recommend this movie to anyone who loves 18th century British Drama... Cheers Tamara ",1496361600,2,526,4.1568627450980395

8643180,1,B00IKVSNDC,"I know we should only review the movie, but I had to write this for those of you who want to pay $6 more for the digitally remastered version instead of the $3.95 DVD from Amazon. It's NOT digitally remastered. There is absolutely no picture quality difference between this DVD and the regular one . The only reason I bought this DVD was because it was advertised as Digitally Remastered and since I love this movie I was hopping for a better quality version. I have Pride and Prejudice 1996 with Colin Firth both regular DVD and the digitally remastered version and there is a huge difference in picture quality.

  A Hazard of Hearts (1987):
Regency love story based on Barbara Cartland novel, with good acting and beautiful period costumes.
  Serena, a beautiful young lady whose father's gambling habits throws her faith in the hands of a handsome stranger named Lord Vulcan. She finds herself in his family castle full of mysteries and dark secrets, while the cruel Lord Wrotham, a man whom she despises greatly, will stop at nothing in his attempts to make her his.

 Lady Hamilton (1960+?'):
Regency love story based on true events.
  The picture quality it's worse than some black and white movies from the 30's.  The acting is ok, the costumes are very beautiful but hard to see them well because of blurry images. The script it's very poor and the movie is more of a light porn than a love story.
  Emma Hart was a famous prostitute/mistress and became a favorite muse to painter George Romney at the turn of the century in 1800. She rise from obscure poverty to fame and wealth (for a while), but she is most known for her love affair with Horatio Nelson later lord Nelson, who was a British war hero and admiral during Napoleonic wars.",1426118400,8,1747,4.618122977346278
