8247029,1,B0012OTVCG,"From time to time a director can take a almost nonexistent bueget and turn out a master piece, other time they turn out medicore or bad films, but this director turned out one of the worst movie every, period. This film fits in well with the 100 plus other crap fests that Brain Damage films attempts to past off as movies.

Purvos is a combination of bad acting, bad special effects, a piss poor script, a guy who is doing what I can only assume was suppose to be a Micky Ronney impression and medicore to one of the ugliest looking women to ever be recorded on film. To the guy that though the female cast was ""hot"",I can only suggest head to the optometrists, now. The ""clown costume"" looks like it was purchased from the discount rack at a Spirit Halloween store.
 About the only thing good I can say about this film is atleast the film work was slightly better than other Brain Damage film crap fest like Carnage Road: the legend of crap.

One previous review suggested that the distrubtor should be beaten with the copies of the film, I think that he is being far to generous. Not only the distrubtor should be beaten with copies of the film but also the director, the cast, writer, producer, who ever provide the $50 budget of the film and who ever at netflix decided to stock this thing.",1277510400,3,1295,4.3875
8247030,5,B0012OTVCG,"Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't a five star movie the way Star Wars or Frankenstein or even Night of the Living Dead is a five star movie.

Purvos was made for next to nothing and has all of the blemishes you might expect of a movie made on the very, very cheap.  I'm giving it five stars, though, because it's fun. It's a hoot. It's very, very enjoyable if--and it's a big if--you love and appreciate fringe, seat of your pants cinema.

I've watched Purvos a couple of times and the second time I had nightmares directly related to the story, so I've got to say that the film reached  me in a visceral way.

I urge you to check out clips on youtube before deciding whether you'd like to buy this film. If you like the clips, you'll like the movie.",1221609600,2,752,4.194444444444445
8247031,5,B0012OTVCG,"This movie can't help but bring a smile to your face, unless you are a beret-wearing/coffee shop-haunting film purist that must find meaning in every last frame of a movie.

Writer Director Jerry Williams, who is known for other works such as Misadventures in Outer Space and Zeppo, has his own style, which is a fusion of sci-fi, horror, comedy, and low budgets in the vein of things such as Troma.  His opus Purvos is highly disturbing on many levels, with the themes of incest and the demented maniac in the clown-like mask (Okay, it does look a little like a scarecrow mask, but I'll not quibble.)

There are hot girls, fetish moments, disgusting come-uppance scenes (make sure you are not eating anything meaty towards the end of the film), and there are some solid actors in it such as Nathan Day.

No, it is highly probable that you will not see this film being discussed at length at a USC film class.  So what.  It's entertainment, and at the least it is a bit original in an age where Hollywood can't conceive of anything beyond a remake, a comic book movie, or a sequel.

have fun, keep it simple, and enjoy the mad, mad world of Jerry Williams.",1215734400,3,1156,4.502392344497608
8247032,1,B0012OTVCG,"The fact that I am the FIRST to rate this movie should tell you something.  Basically, it's about incest, paranormal happenings, REAL bad acting, and masks.  Where the clown part comes in escapes me.  Purvos is played uninspiringly by Conrad Brooks who runs the acting gauntlet from A to A-minus.  He has the screen presence of a can of corn.  Of course if all you think an actor has to do to portray a serial killer is cry ""mommy"" and roll his eyes around, I guess he nailed that.  This cheapie independent entry comes from Brain-Damage Video (and you will be if you watch any of their movies).  Shot direct-to video, I'm sure the budget for the movie was probably $250.00.

Awful; plain awful.  And for those of you who want even more needless knowledge, the movie was directed by Jerry Williams.  Run time is 74 minutes and it is unrated.  All copies should be pulled and the distributor of the film beaten over the head with them.  Again, Amazon should think about ""Zero"" star ratings because this one doesn't deserve one-eighth of a star.",1211414400,5,1043,4.578378378378378
