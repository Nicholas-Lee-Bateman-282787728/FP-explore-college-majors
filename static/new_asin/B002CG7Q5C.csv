8363923,5,B002CG7Q5C,"This is a short video, only 20 minutes but it is packed with information about Missouri Snakes. By the way, it is now available in DVD format, with some bonus features about different snake studies that have been conducted in Missouri by people like Dr. Brian Greene of Missouri State University. Really wonderful stuff.

If you want to teach people about snakes in Missouri, this video is a must have. Many snake species are shown and discussed. A great tool to teach children to respect, not hate, snakes. By the way, there are many more non-venomous, harmless snakes in the state of Missouri than venomous ones. Even the venomous ones tend not to be aggressive.

I picked up a DVD copy at the nature center in Cape Girardeau, MO and I am sure it is available through either the MO Conservation Department website or any of their facilities statewide.

Watch this video before you pass judgment on these creatures! Learn about them--learn to appreciate them and their place in the world. That message is conveyed very well in this little video.",1309219200,,1046,4.767955801104972
