8113007,4,B000EQ5TKG,"Not bad mid-50's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) horror film.  A mad scientist with good intentions and bad methods spends his waking hours grave-robbing and stealing murdered bodies from a wrestling gym with the intention of bringing them back to life after brain transplants.  For what end I'm never quite clear.  Near the end one of his works goes berserk at a wrestling match and send the audience running (best part).  Said work also transmogrifies into a semi-ape with bad teeth.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  Highly recommended.",1474675200,,570,5.208791208791209
8113008,5,B000EQ5TKG,"Ladron De Cadaveres (The Corpse Stealer) is one of the seminal films in the Mexican wrestling movie genre. It stars Wolf Ruvinskis, a classically trained actor and stuntman with additional training in Lucha Libre(Pro Wrestling). He's best known for his portrayal of ""Neutron El Enmascarado Negro"" (Neutron The Man In The Black Mask). His co-stars in this movie are Columba Dominguez and Crox Alvarado both of whom were veterans of the Mexican film industry. The plot of ""Ladron De Cadavers"" revolves around a scientist obsessed with brain transplants and corpse stealing. Ruvinskis portrays Carlos, a charming and aspiring Luchador who is drawn into the scientist's plot. I highly recommend this movie for fans of crisp black and white cinematography and a good story delivered by excellent actors.",1441497600,,798,5.291338582677166
