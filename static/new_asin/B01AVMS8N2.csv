7613685,4,B01AVMS8N2,"Who would ever have thought we'd see a BLU RAY of this weird and low budgeted Sid Pink film, that was filmed in Denmark partly and uses props and interiors and spacesuits from THE ANGRY RED PLANET done a year before. Borrows heavily on Bradbury's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES in one aspect. The film becomes a mess toward the end when the US distributor wanted a better monster and got Jim Danforth to animated a cyclops ""rat"" monster and again, they applied weird color gels to make it seem better. The bonus is the torchy lounge song at the end!",1461801600,3,541,4.474747474747475
7613686,4,B01AVMS8N2,"If you've never seen Journey To The Seventh Planet, you might wonder why there's a new Blu-ray release of it. If you're a fan, prepare to be totally blown away. It looks absolutely fantastic on this new Blu-ray. You can almost read the labels on the dials in the spaceship. We know the original Danish version was ""lost."" People are looking for it. But this is the American release created by Ib Melchior after the directing efforts of Sid Pink, and it's amazing. Uranus, or an alien on Uranus, can read minds and simulate any memories of the spaceship crew. Uranus is a world of simulacra. Maybe the alien, itself, is a creation of the mind of Uranus, or the mind of man. Yes, many people think this movie is a little sexist. But, remember, it's the memories of the spaceship's all male crew. I suggest you buy this Blu-ray and decide for yourself. The commentary by Tim Lucas is packed full of information and certainly worth a listen. Did you know the original soundtrack, now lost, was state of the art electronic music? Now, I do, because of Tim Lucas's insightful commentary. For fans of Journey To The Seventh Planet, this is a must buy. Highly recommended.",1461628800,18,1164,4.600961538461538
7613687,3,B01AVMS8N2,"This review is for the blu-ray release of Journey to the Seventh Planet. This is an interesting sci-fi movie from 1961 and it is unique in that it is the only movie that I know of that makes Uranus it's main location.

Who would have believed that this movie would have an idea taken from it and put into one of the biggest blockbusters of the year. Yes, 'The Martian' uses a major plot point in this movie. When one of the astronauts tears his uniform, he tells the other two to go on because it's hopeless. John Agar says it isn't so. He lets the blood flow from the injured leg and clot and block the hole in the space suit (and what a colorful space suit!)

Don't be fooled by the cover art. Almost nothing you see is in the movie.

We always start with one star. This gets an extra star in my rating because of the blu-ray release and it gets a star for being a bit different. The DVD is very good most of the time but there are spots where it is blurry. Also, there were a few times when the dialogue was not in sync with the video. I'm not sure if that is the DVD or my DVD player. It's nice to have a blu-ray release but it would have been nicer to have a second movie to give it value just like in MGM Midnite Movies. You do get an informative commentary track though along with a few trailers.

'Journey' is shot in color and is filmed in Denmark. I don't know the history of the director Sid Pink but I know he also shot his legendary (so bad it's good) Reptilicus in Denmark also. I believe it had something to do with the subsidies he received and/or benefits from the Danish government.

The movie starts off in the year 2001! A crew of 5 is on a mission to Uranus to look for signs of life. Why, they would check a planet for life that has a temperature of -200 degrees is never explained. They get to Uranus and when they exit the ship it seems like a landscape of a forest on earth (It is, since it's being created from their memories). When they land we see the landscape around the spaceship change via stop motion effects. Stop motion is used a few times throughout the movie. Most notably when they encounter a one-eyed rodent. Yes, it succumbs to the same fate of every creature created with one eye in science fiction films. The rule of thumb is that if it has one eye it's going to get poked out. At least the space ship didn't have to dodge a meteor shower as did almost every space ship in every movie from that era. They soon realize that everything is being created from their memories and that there is a single creature doing all of this. They also realize that both good and bad memories are being created. This sort of reminded me of 'Forbidden Planet,' mainly how the 'creature from the id' was created. Oddly enough this creature (a one-eyed brain) calls men 'evil.' For whatever reason the creature, through the girls, lets them know that it intends to go to earth to take over. How and why it is on Uranus is never explained. At least I didn't pick up an explanation. At this point, there mission is simple, escape the planet alive (and try and take a hot girl with them too!)

The acting is decent and one of the actresses, Gretta Thyssen, actually plays herself. John Agar has a pin up picture of her and the creature creates an image of her for John to fall in love with.

The plot can be somewhat confusing at times. You're not really sure what is going on at all times and what is real and what isn't. Part of the problem is the editing. The scene where the commander passes out after being injured and waking up in the arms of his imaginary girlfriend is jarring. You see all the other astronauts 'making out' with girls and you wonder if this is just him dreaming while he is passed out but it is not the case. Another confusing moment comes Karl is killed by the giant brain. You don't see it happen and you are not sure what you are seeing until you are told by one of the astronauts that he was absorbed into the brain.

More importantly....the plot really makes no sense at all most of the time. I could never figure out why the creature could do whatever it wanted such as put the astronauts to sleep and get them to see whatever it wanted them to see and yet still had to defend itself. It could have tricked them into do anything so the astronauts really had no chance of killing it. Everything they were seeing was esentially implanted in their brains including the blacksmith shop. None if it was ever really there so how could they be building a weapon. Why on earth(Uranus!) would the creature create a person to explain everything about itself and help it's enemies? This makes absolutely no sense at all.

There is a theme song which is pretty good. It sounds like something you would hear in an old time nightclub and actually has a sad or forlorn tone to it.

One other little side note I thought I'd point out. The one-eyed rodent sounds distinctly like 'Rodan' from Japanese 'kaiju' fame. I don't know if they stole the sound or created it themselves.

Ultimately, this is not a good  movie. But it does have some unusual qualities to it that still makes me enjoy watching it.

Recommended strictly for fans of old science fiction films who want the best possible print.",1460160000,3,5230,4.29746192893401
7613688,3,B01AVMS8N2,"Journey to the Seventh Planet,"" a 1962 Danish-American co-production, opens in the far distant year of 2001. The United Nations has sent a special team of scientists to explore Uranus. This group discovers a planet similar to Earth, complete with a small, Danish-looking village filled with beautiful women. Underneath this utopian veneer is a force that uses the crews memories against them so it can take their spaceship back to Earth and conquer it. Directed by Sidney W. Pink (Reptilicus, The Angry Red Planet), the film stars John Agar, a regular leading man in low-budget science-fiction films of the era.

This B movie has an interesting premise: by 2001, space travel has become commonplace and with it peace on Earth. The United Nations rules the planet and rivalries among nations have ceased in the name of the common good. However, the movie cant help but slip into one cliche after another. Combined with sub-par acting and bargain-basement special effects, the primary entertainment value is seeing how bad things get.

There are two kinds of bad movies. One that is just a series of missteps in which inept plotting and scripting result in a dull product that fails to draw us in. The other is well-intentioned but turns out to be pure camp. Think of Plan 9 From Outer Space or Bride of the Monster, two of Ed Woods cinematic treasures, and you get the idea. Theyre so bad, they are highly entertaining. Journey to the Seventh Planet falls into this category. Its so jaw-droppingly awful that you just have to see what comes next. The dialogue is especially wacky and the actors deliver it with dead seriousness. Wonderful!

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary by film historian Tim Lucas and the theatrical trailer.",1459641600,9,1758,4.9324324324324325

7613693,5,B01AVMS8N2,"BOTTOM LINE: Sure it's kitsch & corny, but JTTSP is chock full of that comforting old school sci-fi innocence which enchants fans of the genre and, honestly, you'll never see this film looking better than here on this hi-def Blu-ray from Kino Lorber. If you're an aficionado of these kinds of movies then this is one JOURNEY that I can whole-heartedly recommend! 5 STARS!

THE STORY: Mankind has at last reached the stars. A shipful of sturdy science studs rockets forth, eager to explore & probe Uranus, (insert your own butt joke here). But waiting for them is an evil space brain, stranded for eons on the icy planet. This malevolent mentality manipulates our brave astro-stallions with the oldest trick in the book: sex. Will the fiendish intellect from beyond the stars succeed? Will our horndog heroes give in to temptation and wind up marooned on the 7th planet, victims of their lusty libidos?? Tune in and find out!

THOUGHTS: A really cornball Danish sci-fi flick, from the same gang who gave us the immortal REPTILICUS. The effects are the usual low budget stuff typical of the period, including some laughable hand-scratched raygun zipzaps. That said, the eye-popping, brightly-colored space suits with the blocky plexiglass visors & antenna are a pretty cool adaption of the traditional Air Force hand-me-downs used in so many other ""futuristic"" space flicks. The sparing use of stop-motion is fun though crude and not entirely successful. A handful of leggy, Euro models are the bait for our hunky explorers. A couple are easy on the eyes but depending on what floats your boat, you may find a couple to be quite um... un-pretty. Watching the guys & gals in the (mostly) Danish cast struggling to phonetically sound out their English dialogue (which was mercifully dubbed later) is worth a few chuckles, if nothing else. JOURNEY TO THE SEVENTH PLANET is undeniably silly stuff, and I'm not quite sure exactly why I like it as much as I do. (I suspect that the combination of clunky stop-mo bits and jazzy John Agar as our testosterone-fueled leading man has much to do with it.)

THE BLU-RAY: Fans of this film should jump for joy at the terrific job Kino Lorber did bringing it to home video in this splendid Blu-ray release! The film looks pretty amazing, all things considered. Picture is quite sharp, the colors are solid & strong. Little to no pixelation or artifacting. Audio portion is equally impressive; no hissing, fading or distortion. Special mention to the absolutely gorgeous main menu display!!! It's a screen-filling work of breath-taking beauty that uses the film's theatrical poster as a 16x9 formatted backdrop to your viewing & listening options, backed by a snippet from the movie's hilarious, lounge lizardy theme song, courtesy of Copenhagen crooner Otto Brandenburg. Minimal extras include theatrical trailers for this and other Kino Lorber releases, and an audio commentary track from Tim Lucas that is fun and informative, if a little on the dry side. This is as nice a hi-def release as you're like to ever see for such an odd sci-fier. I'm very pleased that I sprang for the double-dip upgrade to Blu from my old MGM 'Midnite Movies' DVD.",1466985600,9,3180,4.918063314711359

8748599,5,B01AVMS8N2,"I bought the Kino-Lorber standard DVD of this title as part of their summer 2018 sale, mostly because of the Tim Lucas audio commentary -- I already owned the old MGM/UA Midnight Movies two-on-one edition, but I thought this was worth it, and is it ever!

The movie itself is a given -- JOURNEY TO THE SEVENTH PLANET has been well-known to sci-fi and cheesy movie enthusiasts for decades, a wild-and-woolly ride into the territory of cheesy/silly/fun science-fiction/adventure pioneered in the USA by pictures like CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON and FLIGHT TO MARS, and thoroughly satirized by AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON. And the enhancements to be gotten from the HD upgrade only make it more enjoyable, in that it's now much more pleasing to the eye, and easier to appreciate various aspects of the production. It's still a silly but entertaining movie, with a few interesting parallels that I've always connected thematically to at least one Twilight Zone installment.

But the REAL delight of this DVD or its Blu-Ray edition comes in the form of Tim Lucas's commentary track. Having done more than a few of the latter myself -- mostly on ""better"" movies than this -- I can speak with authority to the careful mix of charm and depth that Lucas brings to his discussion of the movie, as he ranges freely across the cinematic history of two continents (trust me, it's valid here -- the production history of this movie and the careers of the people involved could have filled a book, and constitute [as presented here] an adventure even more intriguing than the one purportedly taken by the space travelers in this picture), several movers and shakers in the world of B-pictures and beyond, the pop-culture perceptions of space travel, and science-fiction literature. (Curiously enough, however, for all of his wide-ranging discussion of antecedents and descendants of this movie -- and there are many, on different levels -- nowhere did I hear Lucas mention one of the most obvious 1980s films to have paralleled elements of this picture, GALAXY OF TERROR, which I actually did see in a theater. Ah well . . . it's a small oversight). From Bert I. Gordon to the Three Stooges to Ray Bradbury and Robert Heinlein, Lucas's discussion encompasses nearly everything relevant, and does so in a manner that is at least as entertain as the movie itself.

Kino-Lorber have a real winner here, and one well worth the additional purchase. Lucas's commentary is almost like buying a really good book (okay, let's say a monograph) about this movie -- a notion which is far more worthwhile than the casual observer might, at first, think -- and the picture never looked or sounded better (and that's another point in its favor -- there's nothing anemic about the movie's audio in this edition, either).",1530316800,,2780,4.860759493670886

8748604,5,B01AVMS8N2,"Low budget sci-fi film from the early 60s. I saw it as a kid in a theater and loved the sub par special effects. But it is intrigung to have an alien power materialize the very thoughts from the recesses of the mind. I enjoyed it just as much now that I'm in my 60s. Just take it as it is, a Saturday matinee offering to be enjoyed on a rainy afternoon. I was intrigued about the Danish version of this film, apparently lost, as I noticed some of the characters having trouble speaking English phonetically.

Once there they find the requisite weirdness.  They come across semi-fake wooded terrain and somewhat spooky Danish hotties.  It seems a space brain is stranded on the dead planet and wants to possess the astro-guys minds, bodies, and spaceship so it can hitch a ride to Earth and take over there.  One good moment is when the brain creates a one-eyed bi-pedal rat monster that rattles the space jocks.  The Midnite Movies DVD is good quality, but the one to get is the Kino Lorber DVD.
