8334598,3,B001PSOCR8,"Hard to keep up with the works if you are not a dancer. The music is nice, but to many movements in one segment. I feel that I have to stop and work on my coordination and then push play.  Not a fun way to work out. But if you are a dancer this is perfect for you.",1474848000,,264,3.5517241379310347
8334599,5,B001PSOCR8,THIS is my Go To Video for results! I follow the cardio with a different  (from 4) ab routine each time. I gain weight in my middle first and this video targets that and the rest falls into place ,1442534400,,196,4.0
8334600,5,B001PSOCR8,Great for all women who want to look and feel great about their body. I love it.,1405123200,,80,3.764705882352941
8334601,1,B001PSOCR8,"I tried to like this. Every set I did was boring, and dull. I could not get past the boredom factor. It can sit on someone else shelf.",1382659200,,134,3.8214285714285716
8334602,4,B001PSOCR8,"I really liked this DVD, and I especially enjoyed how the exercises are different than anything I've ever done. I'd recommend it for anyone looking to switch up their ab routine. I wish she would say that you're only supposed to work abs on nonconsecutive days, though. Also, the ""Total body/cardio bonus section"" is kind of lame and boring, but the ab workout is really a good one.",1327104000,3,382,4.632352941176471
8334603,5,B001PSOCR8,"I do ab exercises all the time, and this is one of the better routines.  I can feel the burn in the abs without hurting my back, and without having to do a million reps.  Very concise, clear exercises.  I definitely recommend this DVD.",1298505600,5,235,4.295454545454546
8334604,2,B001PSOCR8,"Tracy York introduces too many movements at a time and does not introduce them well. Wish I hadn't wasted the money, I'm disappointed in this Shape workout video.",1280016000,4,162,4.821428571428571
8334605,5,B001PSOCR8,"First of all, please note that this is not a new workout. This workout was previously released as Shape Your Abs (2004) with Tracy York as the instructor. The DVD has a 35 minute cardio and weights circuit training workout.  The cardio section alternates 5 minutes of cardio with 2 minutes of body sculpting. The abs section is comprised of  four 5-minute ab workouts: basic crunches, pilates-inspired, core conditioning and dynamic. There is a 12-minute bonus workout that uses weights and compound exercises. I personally enjoyed this DVD because it was fun and effective. I would recommend it to solid intermediate exercisers.",1236124800,35,629,5.1568627450980395
