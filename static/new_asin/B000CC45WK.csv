8097507,4,B000CC45WK,"Much of what is going on, and the context of the forms really requires that you have a copy of the Muyedobotongji.  Though for people interested in this video, that is not likely to be a problem.",1392336000,,195,4.27027027027027
8097508,3,B000CC45WK,"First of all, I did enjoy this dvd. I have been learning sword-work for years now and am always looking to expand my knowledge base. This dvd teaches nothing, it shows you a lot. There is no explanation of techniques, proper cutting method, weight-distribution in foot-work, etc. If you don't need much help in those regards, or if you are willing to just guess if from watching the video, then you will love it. The forms presented are cool, a little showy for my taste (the koreans, much like chinese, love to add some flair. Not trying to be offensive, but compare the flair in martial arts to japanese, very little).
Over-all, I got this dvd to learn more sword, and it has allowed me to do that. I recommend this dvd, although it's best if you previously have some sword experience, even the basics will be fine.",1373328000,2,817,4.527027027027027

8097510,4,B000CC45WK,"This is fairly well done display of interpretations of the weapons and open hand forms of the historic Korean Military manual- Muye Dobo Tongi. It is interesting that each form is usually demonstrated by different masters, and there are sometimes very different interpretations of the forms. What makes this video special is that it brings to life the difference in style between Korean and Japanese sword forms (and thereby sword philosophies). The original military manual was developed to help the Korean military preserve and study military arts. That included not only their own, but that of potential enemies (Japan and China), so it is interesting to see those differences.",1298505600,3,680,5.247706422018348
8097511,5,B000CC45WK,"Ancient Korean Sword and Weapon Arts

Turtle press offers 3 DVDs of Korean sword Martial arts, two modern arts (Kumdo and Haedong Kumdo) and Ancient Korean Sword and Weapon Arts.  This DVD demonstrates the ancient sword and weapon arts as recorded in the text Muye Dobo Tongi, which was written in 1790 A.D.

This is the best sword DVD I have found.  This DVD includes most of the forms in the text, with the most notable exception of the forms on horseback.  There are 4 Japanese sword forms (Toyuryu, Woonkwangryu, Chunyuryu, Ryupiryu)  and 5 Korean sword forms (Ssang Soo Do, Ye Do, Je Dok Gum, Bon Kuk Gum, Ssang Gum), and you will see each form 3 times. First, each form is presented independently by two different masters, then a third close up of the form is recorded where the video technician is so close that you can hear the sword cut through the air.  The forms are valuable tools in interpreting the unfamiliar terminology of the old Muye Dobo Tongi text, such as ""goose posture,"" ""single horned bull combat position,"" or ""leopard head pressing the summit posture.""

This DVD also presents other weapons, flag spear, crescent sword, spear sword, shield art, long stick and Shaolin long stick.  On these other weapons, we see each form only twice, both as a first demonstration and a replay of the same demonstration.

This 70 minute DVD is long on demonstrations, and short on talk.  There is three minutes of introduction, and equally brief concluding comments at the end of the tape.  This is a  definite ""must have.""",1188345600,13,1532,4.735849056603773
