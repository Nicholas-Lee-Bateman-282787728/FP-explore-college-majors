1637957,4,B00005O06W,"I'm very impressed with the audio and picture quality for this movie. If you're looking for good old Chuck Norris with his smooth and slick style then you should get this title. The plot is kinda one way but if you're looking for mere entertainment, then get this title.",1019520000,,270,4.530612244897959
1637958,3,B00005O06W,"This should have been called Invasion Miami or Invasion Florida.
There is talk about ""attacks"" all over the US but the films budget didn't show any of that. The action is limited to Florida.
Lucky the BigBadGuy stays in that area since he has a grudge against Chuck Norris's character.
Norris does NO wrong in this movie. He always has the upper hand.
It's a bit dark; even on DVD. It's not very long. There are no real extras here.  The amazon.com price is good. The wife wanted it for her collection.",1015286400,,502,4.456521739130435
1637959,5,B00005O06W,"I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time and it was worth the wait.  Chuck Norris is at it again, defending the free world and bringing down the bad guys.  If you like the average action movie, you'll love this as it is an outstanding example of the genre.
MGM Gave this movie a pretty good transfer treatment, a fully anamorphic widescreen transfer with actual surround sound.  Not bad for a 16 year old film that wasn't a blockbuster.  Not much in the extras department, but digging up a widescreen trailer for the film is better than the nothing that they've given with some films.
All in all a good, satisfying Chuck Norris movie and a great value DVD purchase.",1006300800,27,671,4.475409836065574

Chuck pulls no punches and instead deals in bullets and action with plenty of punching! If you're a bad guy Latin dude and get in the way of special agent Hunter then you better have brought your own body bag because you're dead! I think I loved this movie so much because Chuck reminded me of my dad if my dad was as cool as I imagine him to be, just like Chuck Norris as his character in this totally bad ass movie. Just look at the poster, the dude is totally ripped and ready to kick butt! The best part is that it takes place in Florida and you know the alligators are going to eat the bad guys after Chuck Norris takes care of them. My favorite scene is when they have the twist ending because it both surprised me and kept me on the edge of my seat! This movie is a no brainier for anyone who knows they want to be thrilled!

1638008,5,B00005O06W,This is one of my all time favorite Chuck Norris films. I have to say that Scream Factory did an outstanding job of mastering this film as it is a 30 year old print. Even the soundtrack sounds great. I would love to see them do more Norris films. It's a shame they couldn't get chuck for an interview but it is a small company and probably didn't have the funds or maybe he just didn't want to. Either way the film has a great transfer with some slight grain but then again it was a little grainy in the theater but they cleaned it up pretty well. Usually there is always some grain in scenes featuring sky or fog or smoke or even bright sunlight. Hard to get away from but still a great job.,1468627200,6,692,4.095588235294118

1638015,3,B00005O06W,"it is 1985 and here we have Chuck Norris, the government gives him Carte Blanche to deal with a band lead by Richard Lynch who is trying to take down the US of A. Chuck will have none of that especially since he captured the bad guy one other time but was not allowed to finish him off, Chuck was right and now look at the mess we are in! We also get the pretty reporter who helps him out. Now having said that it is the typical 1980's chuck Norris thing where even though 50 guys are shooting at him with machine guns....no one gets close. is this mindless drivel....yes, yes it is. but this movie for some reason has become something of a cult classic. It is the usual mix of mayhem and the usual type of Golan/Globus bad production and bad editing and bad most other things too, but strangely we like it. My personal favorite line from Chuck "" i'm going to hit you with so many rights, you will beg me for a left!"" HAHA.",1461369600,3,923,4.133333333333334

1638022,5,B00005O06W,"Most of the Chuck norris films from the 80's are now on blu-ray by MGM who still owns the rights to the films
LONE WOLF MCQUADE, CODE OF SILENCE, MISSING IN ACTION 1 & 2, DELTA FORCE, INVASION USA
are now on blu-ray by MGM but have the same content as the very old dvd versions, meaning no new extras
all you will get is the Original theatrical trailers on these blu-ray reissues
if anything, MGM made the effort with giving new HD transfers to the films that's it
and MGM also boosted the sound quality for the films from Mono sound to Master stereo mix which does sound slightly better
than the old Mono sound, so obviously MGM made some effort with quality of the films, but didn't bother with the extras
for some reason they just didn't want to add new extras, making of featurette or new interview with Chuck norris
maybe Chuck norris doesn't like to be interviewed for the films he did with Cannon, it's anybody's guess why

So Shout factory was very lucky to gained the rights to one of Chuck norris films, somehow Shout factory made a deal with MGM
to get INVASION USA & BRADOCK M.I.A III on blu-ray aswell
don't know why other Chuck norris films were not passed on to Shout factory
INVASION USA & BRADOCK M.I.A. got the pick
the new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio Shout factory gives for Invasion looks really Good, hardly no Grain or Dirt in the picture
much better restoration than the very old Digital remaster quality
plus the sound quality has been boosted with 2 new Audio options, 5.1 master audio mix which sounds really Good
plus the usual 2.0 stereo mix, 5.1 mix sounds much better than the old stereo mix anyday
there's also new special features aswell, MGM wouldn't of bothered with the extras
a new 29min interview LOOSE CANNONS with screen writer James Bruner who wrote the script for Invasion USA
he talks about working with Cannon & Chuck norris etc, worth watching for sure
CANNON CARNAGE make up effects featurette on the film
interviews with Greg Nicotero, Howard Berger & Tom savini-18mins
this featurette was surprising to me i didn't know there was any make up effects in the film
i've seen the film many times, lots of explosions, but what special make up effects-i didn't get it
that's the only 2 featurettes you get
no new interview with Director Joseph zito, however Joseph does do a new commentary for the film
very interesting commentary he talks in great detail about Directing the film & working with Cannon
there's also the usual Trailer, TV spots & Photo stills Gallery
what's missing from this blu-ray- a new Chuck norris interview, maybe he declined an interview, who knows
very Disapointing i would've loved his thoughts on the film
but at least there's some new extras on this blu-ray the only Chuck norris film to get special edition treatment
Well Done shout factory much better effort than what MGM would've given which is no effort
time to throw out the very old Digital remaster dvd version which is worth nothing
get this new Blu-ray of the film- 5 stars for the blu-ray",1458259200,12,3018,4.599257884972171
1638033,5,B00005O06W,"The 1985 Chuck Norris vehicle ""Invasion U.S.A."" is one of the craziest and most over the top action films from that glorious decade. What makes the film such a memorable artifact of that bygone era is that everybody was dead serious about this film and there was no tongue in cheek humor or satiric style like what was featured in ""Commando"" which also was released the same year which makes ""Invasion U.S.A.""  even funnier in its own way.

Directed with verve and aplomb by Joseph Zito with makeup work by Tom Savini as well as featuring a script co-written by Chuck Norris, it is never boring and features some stupendous & brutal action pieces alongside a nutty performance by the equally nutty Richard Lynch as the villain. Don't go looking for the film to make a lick of sense plot wise at times. Just look at the cover art of Chuck Norris dual wielding machine guns which is all you need to tell you what kind of film you are in for.

""Invasion U.S.A"" gets its long overdue bluray release courtesy of the always awesome folk at Shout Factory. The film is presented in its original 1.85:1 theatrical ratio and the print used was in great shape. Detail is improved incredibly over the ancient flipper DVD released many years ago. No digital scrubbing appears to have been used and the film retains its grain structure. Audio is presented in 5.1 DTS master audio as well as lossless 2 channel stereo and really packs a punch.

Extras include a great commentary track by director Joseph Zito, a 29 minute interview with co-writer James Bruner, a hilarious 17 minute featurette about the makeup effects team headed by legend Tom Savini, the theatrical trailer, a TV spot, a still gallery and the trailer for ""Braddock: Missing in Action III"" which is also getting released on bluray by Shout Factory.

Highly recommended for fans of Chuck Norris as well as 80's action films in general.",1457913600,20,1887,4.688821752265861

Chuck sets out to take down a known terrorist, Rostov, and his rogue army as they ""invade"" south Florida and spread havoc using bombs, bazookas, and guns galore in this 1985 gem.
 After the success of 1984's ""Missing In Action"" about him going back to Vietnam to retrieve POWs, he decides to take on terrorists right here at home. This is one of my favorites of Chuck and has some nice one liners and fast moves.

 Widescreen, DTS HD 5.1 Audio, color picture art inside the Bluray case also.
Special Features, something lacking in previous editions of his movies are all right here for this one.
** Theatrical Trailer
** TV Spot
** New Audio Commentary by Director Joseph Zito
** New Interviews with Special Effects and Writers on the making of the movie.

Chuck delivers a slew of tough-guy quotes, ""It's time to die."" and there's very little downtime between explosions and gunfire. I like finding action flicks I can pop in on a Friday night and have a few beers. I guess I expected a cheap looking movie but the stunts are real and it shows.

1638126,3,B00005O06W,"""Invasion U.S.A."" had me hooked from its premise and cover. It stars Chuck Norris wielding two uzis battling terrorists! No one can say no to this. Now, one thing I would like to clarify first. I love love love dumb action films or just the action genre in general. Brandon Lee, Chow Yun Fat, Arnold, Donnie Yen, Jason Statham, I love em all. That being said, this was my very first Chuck Norris film (I know crazy right). So, I went with this because it looked hard core but fun at the same time.

*spoilers ahead*

Unfortunately, I found this film to be not very good. The villains say they are going to take over the U.S., but their plan is ridiculous because their two leaders always attack the same state that they and Chuck Norris are in. I know this movie didn't probably have the budget to show mass mayhem, but I found it very difficult to believe these guys were causing as much mayhem as the news said they were and that seeing more of it would have helped. Instead, I felt we just got to see some very random terrorist acts. Also, if these guys are so smart as to how they can invade the U.S. undetected and cause mass mayhem, why are they so stupid that they fall for that trap on the news! And as for the trap, what is the point of the scene where the police break into Chuck's hotel and arrest him. They say he's under arrest and everything, and than once the bad guys come to the trap, Chuck isn't arrested and he's on top of the building with a bazooka. If this was all a set up, than why do the police in Chuck's hotel room say, ""You cannot kill and blah blah you're going to jail, we don't know who you are anyway."" What is the point of them saying that to him if it was a trap/set up all along that they worked on together!!! They would have had to have made up the plan on the way for that to make sense, but we don't see that happen. There is no point that scene is seen by us, the viewer.

Okay, now that's out of the way, the pacing is bizarre too. Take the mall shootout. THAT is what you call an action scene. Its well shot and edited in a way that makes the action scene very exciting and fun to watch. The gun blasts are awesome and it ends with a cool car chase. However, the final shootout in the building is a mess of an action scene. Chuck slowly walks around the scene and it is supposed to be intense. Every once in awhile, some baddie pops up and Chuck blasts him (which is awesome). But than, the film cuts back to the mass war outside. Than, it cuts back to the ultra slow and boring scenes inside of the building where Chuck is walking around and happening upon bad guys every other minute. This scene did not know how to be truly suspenseful and mishmashed a hectic war with a slow and dreary shootout. It drags on for so long and not that much happens.

If you think I hate this movie though, I don't. It knows how to be awesome with some great action scenes and has a cheesy but awesome patriotic message. I mean, it's Chuck Norris for goodness sakes. His acting is a little bland, but he knows how to kick major butt. The villain is totally crazy and I love when 80s villains are just insane bastards from hell. Overall, the dvd quality is pretty bland. It is only $5 so I expected nothing amazing, but this film definitely needs a facelift. This needs a Blu Ray. Also, the cover on Amazon is NOT what you will be getting. You'll get some stupid photoshop cover that says ""The Best of Chuck Norris"" and they photoshop his body from the film with a massive machine gun that he never uses in the film. So, the dvd case is lame in comparison to the awesome cover that the site advertises. So, Amazon, update that!

1638130,5,B00005O06W,"Invasion USA proves that the whole Academy awards process is a farce. I know that this issue is raised every year in some corner - Kramer Vs Kramer robbed Apocalypse Now, Titanic robbed LA Confidential ect. But seriously, Invasion USA should have been at least nominated for best picture because it was arguably the most entertaining film of 1985 (perhaps only rivaled by Re-Animator).

I cannot endorse this film enough. It's non-stop carnage and mayhem. Seriously, even when Chuck Norris has a conversation with somebody he's either threatening them, strangling them or pointing a gun at them. Yes, this film is a good as this last statement makes it sound.

To counterbalance the awesomeness of Chuck, we have Richard Lynch as the main bad guy, Rostov. This is one of the craziest bad guy performances ever. The part where he inexplicably murders a drug dealer and a prostitute is one of the top ten greatest film scenes ever committed to film.

This just goes to show how out of touch the Academy is. They need to introduce new award categories; things like: Best Film Violence, Highest Body Count, Best Use of Profanity, Best Use of a Flamethrower, Most Awesome Scene Involving a Tank and Most Inspiring Jump Kick to Someone's Face. I would watch that show and if they had those categories, a film like Invasion USA would be appropriately recognised as the cinematic masterpiece that it is.

Anyway, Chuck with his dual uzis and Richard with his self-reloading RPG have carved a niche in cinematic history. You owe it to yourself to see this movie. And then watch it monthly thereafter.",1365379200,,1591,4.838235294117647

1638134,5,B00005O06W,"I'll be frank here, I grew up trying desperately to wear out a VHS copy of this movie. Never did, before the VCR I was using died. So, after that I kinda ditched the effort but never forgot the movie. A few years later, I came back to the movie in the form of DVD, and as much cheese as it was then, it is still classic cheese today.

First off, this isn't a Die Hard. There is pretty much nothing intellectual about this movie, except the overarching concept. Lots of gun-fighting, lots of explosions, lots of terrorism, not much in the way of deep thinking or philosophizing. This isn't a particularly bad thing; sometimes, what is supposed to be an action movie turns out to be more deep thinking than action, which isn't exactly what you asked for if you're looking for Chuck.

The selling point of this movie, oddly enough, is the simple plot. Russian Operator uses drug money to fuel a terrorist campaign against America At Large. Keep in mind, this was published initially back in the bad old days of the Soviet Union; the possibility of the Red Machine using surrogates to assault America directly was considered a very real threat in those days, even if the media would not harp on it. Nowadays, you could publish the same movie with only changing the nationality of the Russian Operator to something else (Latin America for drug trade, Mideast for classic terrorism, Europe for communist revivalism, Far East for a Far East ascension), keep the rest of the plot the same, and it would still make sense in context. There is a subtle beauty in a simple plot, and Invasion USA hits that nail squarely on the head.

The 115% CHEESE comes into play mostly in the arsenal. Seriously, don't think too hard about the arsenal. Don't do it. I mean it. Mac-9 SMGs can't be used the way Chuck does. And that isn't even the most egregious offense of misused arsenal in the show. I'll not say anything more than that.

On the other hand, the finale scene is pure beauty. I'd hate to be involved in the cleanup, of course. I shall not spoil it any further than that.

If you're a Chuck fan, a Cannon Films fan, or a fan of straight-to-the-point action, this is a classic.",1346112000,,2166,4.5012722646310435
1638135,4,B00005O06W,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Invasion U. S. A."" starring Chuck Norris. I found it at Wal-Mart on the five-dollar rack. Well, what can I say? It's another of those totally improbable, wildly imaginative, overly violent Chuck Norris action sagas. I don't really know why I watch these things, except that they're fun. The violence, the gunfire, the killings, the explosions and the destruction are so rampant that it actually becomes funny. It's a bizarre form of humor, I suppose. Sick, perhaps, but still funny.

Well, in the Invasion U. S. A. saga, the Florida Coast is invaded by a fleet of amphibious vehicles carrying hundreds of highly armed and highly organized terrorists. They sweep out onto land and are quickly and efficiently dispersed into Miami where they start blowing up homes, breaking up parties and killing innocent people. In some places they are disguised as police officers or the National Guard forces, creating confusion among the populace. The leader of the invasion is a sometime Soviet agent named Rostov (Richard Lynch), who is one bad dude. Matt Hunter (Chuck Norris) is a former CIA agent who is convinced to come out of retirement in order to dispatch this really bad and pesky dude. It's the old western movie all over again. There's the Black Hats (Rostov and the invading force) who are about as bad as bad can get and are out to inflict widespread damage in order to get their way. Then there's the White Hats led by Hunter. Well, just like any western movie, the White Hats ultimately beat the Black Hats, except that the gunfight between the two factions is much more elaborate and violent. And just like in any old western movie, the final battle is between the #1 White Hat and #1 Black Hat. Who wins? Well, take a guess.

Okay, the whole plot is absurd and an exercise in stupidity. But that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch. It is fun to watch. I consider it to be a very violent action comedy and, as such, it's rather well done. The acting is so-so. The production and stunts are quite good. It's well paced so you don't have to think about the ridiculous plot that you're following. It's good entertainment for the buck.

1638144,4,B00005O06W,"A bunch of Cuban refugees, on a boat drifting in the ocean, with no food, no water, no hope.  Suddenly, a Coast Guard vessel!  They are saved!  But unfortunately, as the vessel draws near, we see that it is captained by professional bad guy Richard Lynch, and that cannot bode well.  As indeed it does not, for the ""Coast Guard"" suddenly opens fire on the refugees, wiping them all out in seconds, and soon uncovers the other cargo the boat is carrying - white powder.  But somehow these guys don't look like ""regular"" drug smugglers, so as the credits start rolling and the thunderous, Wagnerian music by Jay Chattaway (which also sounds at times a lot like Basil Poledouris' music for CONAN THE BARBARIAN) starts playing, it isn't hard to guess that these guys mean bad business for the good ol' red, white and blue.  Good thing CHUCK NORRIS is on the scene to save the world - or at least the part of it that matters, Florida.

I haven't seen a whole lot of Chuck's filmography up to this point; certainly I'm less familiar with him than most of his rough action contemporaries like Stallone, Schwarzeneggar, Van Damme and Seagal.  It's not so much because his right-wing politics turn me off; heck if that were a problem, I'd be best off not be watching many American action films to begin with.  Nope, it's mostly circumstance, and the fact that to me ol' Chuck - regardless of the power of his fabled roundhouse kick - just ain't as compelling a presence to me as the others.  I'm not sure how much INVASION U.S.A. is going to change my mind, but regardless of how ""good"" or ""bad"" it is, it's more fun than not, and Chuck proves to be able to throw out the one-liners as well as his kicks.

Here he's  retired CIA special operative ""Hunter"" (what else?) living in the Everglades region in a broken-down shack, but when Mikhail Rostov (Lynch) and his henchmen show up on the scene, his ex-boss comes begging - and is shown the door.  It isn't until Rostov and a dozen of his goons wipe out Hunter's shack and kill his best buddy that he decides it's time to get back in the action - and just in the nick of time, as it turns out that Rostov is masterminding a plot to strike terror into the heart of the country by simultaneously hitting civilian targets in several major cities and creating chaos, forcing martial law.  What he ultimately hopes to gain from this is never made explicit; I guess Chuck - who cowrote the screenplay from a story that was cowritten by his brother Aaron, and probably deserves to be considered the real ""auteur"" here as much as director Joseph Zito - felt it was just enough to have a bunch of Russian and other non-American thugs attacking us soft Americans to make the plot work.  Well, uh, no, it really wasn't enough.  In any case, after several scenes of mayhem in which the evil smirking Rostov and his teams are seen randomly blowing up houses and shooting up restaurants and such, Chuck finally arrives on the scene.  It's almost halfway through the movie at this point, unfortunately, but better late than never.  And Chuck quickly makes up for it by saving a church full of people from a bomb (and then dropping it onto the would-be bombers from a three-story building, having plenty of time for a nice soliloquy as they don't bother to draw their automatic weapons on him or anything even though he's holding the bomb); saves a schoolbus from getting blown up; and stops a bunch of bad guys as they're shooting and blowing up a mall.  He sure gets around; he also makes time to save a cute hot-shot reporter (Melissa Prophet) several times - she also manages to be on the scene over and over.  But it just isn't enough - and so Chuck hatches the ultimate plan....

I don't expect a whole lot of believability from most action movies, but INVASION U.S.A. shreds logic to the point where calling it a fantasy as much as an action movie would be entirely appropriate - and the best way to enjoy it.  First, like I said, Chuck is on the scene over and over, without showing any real indication of how he knows each spot the terrorists are going to hit.  It's like he has a terrorism GPS in the jeep he drives around (which never suffers a scratch through most of the film, despite being fired on by machine guns repeatedly) - more than a decade before GPS even existed of course.  And Chuck gets through every scrape completely and totally without a scratch.  His dang wavy hairdo never even gets messed up, and his clothes never get ripped.  Maybe there's a smudge or two of dirt a couple of times, that's about it.  And then, of course, there's the notion that local police - even the National Guard and (one would hope) the Army and Marines - can do nothing about a few dozen small terrorist groups all over the country, but Chuck alone can clean up Miami and also mastermind a plan at the end to bring ALL of the terrorists to one location in a trap that none of them will figure out.  Well, that's Chuck Norris I guess - not content to be the winner, he has to be a virtual Superman.  The problem with this is that it drains every ounce of real suspense from the film knowing that he isn't even going to so much as get a scratch, and that no matter what the odds he will always come through.  One Chuck with a couple of guns is a match for armies.  And by implication, one tough American can wipe out all the Commie hordes in the world.  Then again - if you're not taking it seriously at all, maybe it's not so much of a problem.  I know I was laughing plenty by the crazy over-the-top ending.

On the good side - as opposed to the so-bad-it's-good - there is some decent Florida location work here, and Lynch is kind of fun as the embodiment of absolute and total evil (shooting kids in the head while laughing, that kind of thing), and there are some nice explosions.  Actually lots of nice explosions.  I think they must have spent about half the budget on explosions.  And the rest on Chuck's hair.",1272931200,,5949,4.419798350137489

BAD IDEA.

It seems this is just the thing to get him out of his retirement...and he will stop at nothing to make every last terrorist pay.

The Gods who were Golan and Globus have blessed the world with this eternally fun and gratuitously violent movie.

1638170,4,B00005O06W,"Boy I really loved the 1980's.  It was a time when you could have films that were totally unapologetic in their over-the-top patriotism.  Just try to get a movie like this made today...the lefties would never let it fly.  This was when Chuck Norris was at his peak with movies like this, ""Delta Force"" ""Missing in Action"" and ""Code of Silence"".  The plot is utterly ridiculous but that's really what makes it so fun.  It was the 1980's.  The time of excess.  Logical plots need not apply.  it was a Cannon film so enough said.

The premise has a rogue soviet agent named Rostov, played by preeminent screen baddie Richard Lynch, leading a terrorst invasion in South Florida.  The mixed bag of European, Asian, and Middle-Eastern terrorists start by blowing up residential homes with bazookas, and just as the family had been decorating the tree for Christmas.  Later they impersonate police officers and shoot up a Latino street party.  When the real cops arrive the party guests pelt them with rocks and bottles.  The terrorist goal is to spread panic in America.  Totally outrageous!

Norris is Matt Hunter, a former CIA agent.  He is asked to go after Rostov but refuses since he could have killed the agent several years ago but his superiors had ordered him to capture him alive.  Rostov now has nighmares about Hunter and wants nothing more than to see him dead.  They try blowing up his home in the swamp but Hunter escapes and finally goes after the terrorists with full force.

There are really some classic scenes such as Hunter plowing into a crowded mall filled with holiday shoppers, Uzi's blazing as he takes out the terrorists without a single civilian getting hurt. Later the terrorists attach a bomb to a school bus loaded with kids.  Hunter grabs the bomb off the side, races after the terrorists, pulls up next to them and says ""Did you lose this?"" and tosses the bomb in their car...Boom!  Just classic, cheesy action of the highest order.  This all leads to the inevitable climax.  The Army finally arrives and surrounds the terrorists after they've set a trap for them.  The streets are filled with those big steel girders blocking the road, just like on the beaches of Normandy in a surrealistic scene.  And finally Hunter has his showdown with Rostov in the (literally) explosive final moments.

Oh this is artful camp at its most skilled but this really is one fun movie.  Chuck says little, which is probably a good thing and lets his feet and guns do the talking.  Great actioneer!",1112659200,13,2508,4.716589861751152
1638171,3,B00005O06W,"The 1980s were a tough time to live through. First, Cold War hysteria reached new heights when Ronald Reagan talked trash with the commies as wife Nancy consulted astrology charts in the White House. Second, those crazy cranks in Cuba and the Soviet Union attempted to establish footholds in Grenada and El Salvador while running the show in Nicaragua. Third, the Medellin and Cali cartels shipped a few million boatloads of cocaine into the United States. Fourth, Islamic terrorists made headlines when they hijacked an ocean liner, several airplanes, and set off a car bomb that killed over 200 U.S. Marines in Beirut. Fifth, at least once a week the television set blared out a noxious series of audio tones otherwise referred to as the theme song from ""Growing Pains,"" a sound that still haunts me to this day. Sixth, I not only went to but also survived that adolescent experience we call high school. All of these events--and a million others--gave most of us sweaty palms for roughly ten years. Fortunately, the 1980s also saw a plethora of action films released under the Cannon Films banner. If not for Michael Dudikoff, Charles Bronson, and Chuck Norris it is unlikely any of us would have survived the decade.

The same director who brought us ""The Prowler"" and a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, Joseph Zito, lensed the Chuck Norris vehicle ""Invasion U.S.A."" It's a chilling story about a vicious KGB agent named Rostov (Richard Lynch) and his plans to undermine our country. The idea is simplicity itself: take a few hundred Latin American communists badly in need of a shower and shave, land them on the beaches of Florida, and drive around wiping out symbols of American domesticity. Rostov and his goons drive into a quiet American neighborhood, pull out a rocket launcher, and start leveling houses. These redski thugs plant bombs on school buses, pose as cops to attack ethnic minority street parties, launch assaults on shopping malls, break speed limits, jaywalk, and on occasion resort to littering all in an effort to turn us against each other. The nerve of these guys! Just in case you aren't aware that these terrorists are really, really bad guys, the movie shows Rostov killing the guy responsible for selling his troops weapons, a sweaty miscreant named Mickey (Billy Drago), and his tacky girlfriend. Our affable KGB agent even throws Mickey's gal out the window after perforating her nose with a coke straw! Blow his head off, I say!

We don't have a chance against this force until Matt Hunter (Chuck Norris) arrives on the scene. Billions of dollars spent on intelligence, arms, and hundreds of thousands of highly trained soldiers can't compare to one ex-CIA operative clad in tight jeans with two machine gun pistols draped across his shoulders. The government approaches our hero with a request to rejoin the fight against his old enemy Rostov, but Hunter is too busy roping in alligators out in the Florida swamps to bother with such trivialities. Until Rostov shows up to murder Matt's best friend and level his home, that is. A now angry Hunter zooms around Florida in a pickup truck impervious to all weapons up to and including nuclear bombs, thwarting the terrorists at every turn. Plan on attacking a church with a satchel of explosives? Matt Hunter doesn't take kindly to that sort of rude behavior. Got a hankering for spraying bullets at a crowded grocery store? Matt Hunter will tell you in no uncertain terms to go hit the showers. Magnetic bomb on a school bus? Not when Matt Hunter's patrolling the highways and byways of America, you don't! By the time the government finally gets around to fielding some troops, our protagonist has it all figured out. And Rostov's hatred for his old nemesis Matt Hunter so blinds him to rational thought that he and his men walk right into a deadly trap. Matt Hunter one, terrorists zero.

""Invasion U.S.A."" ranks as one of the most ridiculous action films of the 1980s as well as one of the most ridiculous Cannon releases, and that's saying something when one considers Bronson's ""Death Wish 3."" Every character in the film is a one-dimensional stereotype, from the good guys to the bad guys to the indigent female reporter McGuire (Melissa Prophet). I can't remember a film where so many cast members exist only to die in violent ways. And it's a rare action film that contains so many unintentional laughs. For instance, one guy who perishes early on reappears later as a background extra. I'm not kidding. He's right there for the whole world to see. Then there is Matt Hunter's ability to roar out of nowhere in his supertruck just in time to stop the latest terrorist shenanigans. How does Hunter know when and where the commies are about to strike? The script told him. Amazing that the police and military can't pull the same trick, isn't it? Lest you think I'm unduly picking on the film, one sequence does require us to think. Hunter drives into the city only to witness scene after of scene of poor Americans acting up in the slums. A message that America isn't worth saving unless we get our act together, perhaps? Who knows? Who cares, for that matter.

MGM apparently bought the rights to many of Cannon's old action films and has been releasing them to DVD over the last year or two. The roaring lion doesn't really respect most of these movies, however, since nearly all of them come with a fullscreen picture transfer and only a trailer as an extra. Yet we must admire MGM for distributing these boilerplates for a new generation of film fans. These pictures were the bread and butter of cable television back in the 1980s, and as bad as most of them are in a technical sense it's still fun to watch them now.",1109894400,4,5705,4.77710233029382

Invasion U.S.A. is a great bad movie, period.  Chuck Norris, normally an awful actor, looks to be trying really hard not to act at all.  Matter of fact, Chuck looks plain creepy, his face completely blank and emotionless.  He plays an ex 'government agent'.  Turns out there's a planned nighttime invasion of America being cooked up by an evil Russian general, an old nemesis of Norris.  There's also some Cubans, and even Arabs from some unnamed country.  They invade America one evening, killing Americans easily because we're weak, etc, etc, and they even roll into town to blow up a few suburban family homes with rocket launchers.
Chuck Norris is the only one in America with any real idea of what's going on, so he wearily puts on his twin Uzi straps and sets out to kill the invaders.  It's a typical 80s, updated cowboys and Indians flick, dripping with cynicism.  Invasion U.S.A. also adheres to an ironclad Golan/Globus rule: the badder the criminal, the worse he has to suffer before dying horribly.
This movie would have scared young children in 1985 into thinking Russia would actually invade and we would be bazookaed in our own homes.  But now it reveals itself to be a true masterpiece, a moment of cinema from a bygone era when exploitation, paranoia, fear, violence, and profit were running amok.
The director is Joseph Zito, so you're in good bad genre hands, he having directed The Prowler and Friday the 13th The Final Chapter before.  The film makes no sense at all.  Like Death Wish 3, for instance, the film deserves a lot of credit for so completely disregarding anything of quality, save for the bullet-riddled violence.  Plot, acting, direction, plausibility are all jettisoned in favor of pure gratification of hidden right-wing fantasies.
If you long for the 80s, love bad movies, love Chuck Norris, love Golan/Globus, love moronic guy movies, this is highly recommended",1073347200,4,2147,4.930555555555555
1638176,2,B00005O06W,"One of Chuck Norris's better known movies; TBS has shown this countless times.  It doesn't really get better with age though.  Not Chuck's best movie but better than several of the real duds like Forced Vengeance and Good Guys Wear Black.  It's Chuck against the Russkies who invade his homeland and really tee him off.  No real extras on the DVD, just the movie.  Action is not really memorable in this movie, and it's pretty unbelievable even for a Chuck movie.  But, if you're a Chuck fan, this one is a must because it's got a few classic Chuck one-liners.",1067212800,3,560,4.55
1638177,3,B00005O06W,"Anyone around in the 80's, when Nancy Regan told us to 'just say no', the US military was paying $900 for a hammer, and and Member's Only jackets were cool, will have most likely had the experience of seeing a Cannon film.  For better or worse, the Golan/Globus group were quite prolific, and their movies tended to focus on visceral elements to satisfy the public, while other aspects like a credible plot, believable story, or realistic characters got swept under the rug, but hey, it worked pretty well and they made great gobs of money (I'd be happy with a single gob of money myself).  This is the company responsible for such films as American Ninja and it's sequels, Sylvester Stallone classics as Over the Top (it's Rocky, but instead of boxing, it's arm wrestling...where's Joel and the 'bots when you need them?) and Cobra, Superman and it's sequels, Deathwish 2 thru 5, Missing in Action movies, Delta Force, and Invasion U.S.A, to name a few.  During the 80's, the Cannon EZ Bake movie machine churned out up to 15 movies per year up until it's bankruptcy in 1990.  One thing for certain, if it was a Cannon movie, you were pretty sure to get big guns, car chases, people getting shot, people getting blowed up real good, and lots of explosions, and Invasion U.S.A certainly doesn't disappoint.  The antagonistic roles in these movies often was decided by how the political winds blew at the time.  Be it the Russians or the Arabs or whoever angered us, you could be sure they would show up as an evil force in a Cannon movie bent on destroying the Amaerican way of life.  Things you weren't guaranteed to get were cohesive plots, character development, continuity, and credibility.  These were testosterone fueled, shoot-em up explosion orgies intended to entertain without requiring a lot of thought.
Invasion U.S.A. features Cannon perennial Chuck Norris as Matt Hunter.  Matt is an ex-operative of some government agency, we're never told which one, so I'll guess it's the CIA.  He lives in the middle of a swamp, I'm assuming Florida, as much of the action in the movie takes place in Miami.  Why he'd want to live in the middle of a swamp by himself I don't know, but maybe it has something to do with his past work with the CIA and just wanting to leave it all behind.
Soon we are introduced to our lead bad guy, Mikhail Rostov, played by Richard Lynch.  You may not recognize the name, but you'd most likely recognize the face.  He's had quite a career in movies and TV, generally always playing a bad guy, due to his somewhat sinister look.  Eventually we learn he's planning an invasion of the USA and a small army of armed men hit the beach.  Their plans involve dressing up like authority figures, attacking civilians, and causing civil unrest.  Apparently, Rostov and Hunter have a past history, as Rostov wants to eliminate Hunter.  Once it's discovered that Rostov is in the US, the agency tries to get the now retired Hunter back into action, but he declines, as he says they should have let him kill Rostov when he had the chance, and it's now their problem, not his.  Rostov, still bearing a super sized grudge, finds Hunter's place in the swamp and blows it up real good, but doesn't manage to kill Hunter.  Along with his house, they also killed his friend, and now Hunter decides to take on the mission.  Naturally the agency says that if he is caught, they will have to disavow any knowledge of Hunter.  By now, I am starting to wish I could disavow any knowledge of this movie....
We get various scenes of the bad guys blowing stuff up, killing Americans here and there, and talking about how weak we are, how easy it is to kill us.  One scene in particular is when they pull up into a suburb and start blowing up houses.  Rostov shoots like six houses with a bazooka, and it must have been one of those spiffy auto-loading kind as I never saw him reload once.  I always thought bazookas were one shot deals, and needed to be reloaded after each use, but what do I know?
Anyway, Hunter mixes it up with terrorists he finds, dispatching them usually with twin uzis strapped to his chest.  He takes out large numbers of terrorists with much ease.  This all leads up to a final confrontation, where a trap is set for the terrorist army, and the fall for it.  The terrorists end up fighting the army in a fairly large battle, while Hunter and Rostov square off and guess who comes out a live in the end?  Rostov is dispatched in a typically spectacular fashion, as is par for these kinds of movies, and the day is saved.  Oh yeah, I alomst forgot, there is a side story involving a female reporter, but that goes nowhere, so it's not really worth mentioning.
Given what this movie was, there a couple of things that kind of annoyed me.  One was the attempt to present it as somewhat patriotic.  This was a common theme at the time this movie came out, but looking at it now, it seems so transparent.  And Chuck Norris really didn't get to use his martial arts skills in this movie.  He hit and kicked a couple of people, but why cast a martial arts expert in an action movie if you aren't going to allow him to use his skills?  Seems like such a waste.  Even at the end, when he's fighting Rostov hand to hand, they could have incorporated some into that, but they blew it.  Oh well....If you want a no brainer actioneer with lots of guns and explosions and little or not plot, then this movie is for you.",1058313600,15,5436,4.5
1638178,3,B00005O06W,"""Invasion USA"" should be a definite guilty pleasure for anyone who thinks it's possible for a movie to be so bad it's good.  It's just plausible enough that it COULD happen, but more than ridiculous enough to provide ample laughs along with the action typical of Chuck Norris movies.  The plot, to the extent that one exists, concerns an evil Russian agent named Rostov (you know he's bad because he has a very swarthy complexion), who leads a small army in an invasion of Florida.  Rostov is one vicious guy: in a memorable early scene, he buys arms from a guy, then shoots him in the crotch and throws a coke whore out the window before departing.  Later on, he and some cronies drive down a residential street randomly bazookaing houses.  Rostov's fiendish plot is to sow unrest among the people, turning them against each other in order to create disorder.  He and his men are always one step ahead of law enforcement, so who can stop Rostov and insure the continued triumph of truth, justice, and the American way?  Why, ex-superagent Matt Hunter, that's who.  After he survives Rostov's attempt to kill him, Hunter springs into action.  In the streets, in the alleys, and even in the mall, Hunter is a one-man wrecking crew, plowing through bad guys to get to Rostov.  He foils numerous terrorist plots, leading up to the all-hell-breaks-loose firefight of the conclusion.  If all this sounds pretty ridiculous, it's because it is.  Early on, Rostov talks a bit about how America's open society leaves its citizens vulnerable to terrorist activity, but the movie quickly abandons any philosophical inclinations for the standard '80's action fare.  Still, if you're a fan of Norris movies, or the bad action genre in general, ""Invasion USA"" is a worthy view.  It actually manages to be one of Norris's better movies, although such a compliment is surely damning it with faint praise.",1050364800,,1888,4.841121495327103
1638179,4,B00005O06W,"If you were a kid in the 80s, you know how influential Cannon films were to your every day life.  They made you want to be a ninja, made you want to arm wrestle your friends so you could try that snaeaky hand trick that never worked, and promised you that He-Man sequel that never happened.  Well, Invasion U.S.A is one of the finer efforts if you ask me.  Regardless of how corny and far fetched it is, it's actually kind of scary considering the events in the world today.  Richard Lynch(who is incapable of playing a good guy), a Russian with a nasty habit of sticking his pistol down people's pants before shooting them is the one behind the Invasion.  The plan is to shoot and blow innocent people to smithereens to create chaos and confusion, turning Americans against each other.  It's supposed to be happening nation wide, but the film centers on the events in Miami where Chuck and Lynch are.  The terrorists are hardcore brutal.  They stick a plastic explosive to a school bus full of kids singing, ""Row Your Boat!""  How about that?  Norris is an agent brought out of retirement(naturally) to singlehandedly stop the threat.  Norris is bad to the bone in this.  He goes about slaughtering terrorists without breaking a sweat, as though this kind of thing happens all the time, and it's all in a day's work for him.  His method of extermination is similar to playing a first person shooter video game with an invincibility cheat code on.  He almost makes Rambo seem lightweight! In his off hours he likes to watch ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers"" with a slight grin.  Watch how he handles a terrorist with a gun to a journalist's head.  This is the kind of film we're probably never gonna see again, and I guess that's good or bad depending on your point of view.  But whether you loved them or dismissed them as complete hacks, the Cannon Group was one of a kind.",1046995200,3,1871,4.520833333333333

The story is about Matt Hunter (Chuck Norris) an ex CIA operative who has retired. His arch nemesis Rostov (Richard Lynch)is a Russian terrorist and he plans on taking over America with his army. Chuck Norris doesn't want to know about Rostov when the CIA first approach him about putting a stop to him but after they blow up his house and kill his friend he is back in action.",1046044800,,607,4.28695652173913

""Invasion U.S.A."" is a startling revelation to lordage. Chuck Norris is definitely a divine person and takes out the garbage without a problem. Stinky mess. People blow up his house for no reason, so he goes on a rampage after the men who did it. Bad guys destroy random houses in a neighborhood and try to take down a mall. Oh no, that doesn't fly, Chuckage drives his pickup through the mall crashing through store windows and takes no prisoners. So much destruction and mayhem to entertain me, yes.

1638182,5,B00005O06W,"Don't listen to any of these people over-analyzing this movie! Chuck Norris is here in all of his mid-80's glory. I don't think the point of this movie was to be compelling or thought-provoking. This movie has everything you could love about the action movie (which doesn't exist today, no thanks to Vin Diesel!)
Plot: Bad guys mess with Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris kills them...all. 'Nuff said. Hordes of terrorists all waiting in line to wreak havoc? No problem for Chuck. Armed with machine guns, rocket launchers and a 4-wheel-drive truck, he WILL deal out his justice. Most poignant are the scenes where he mercilessly drives a knife into a baddie's hand and twists it. Also, the end scene where the head bad guy is cowering in fear in an office is great. Chuck strolls in with his twin uzis strapped to his chest, fearless. Great stuff.
If you don't enjoy watching Chuck destroy anything in his path, don't get this movie. If you love watching somewhat cheesy (in a good way), violent fun, buy it! I say bring back the good old bearded, angry action heros.",1030492800,8,1061,4.679144385026738
