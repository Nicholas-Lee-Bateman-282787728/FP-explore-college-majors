1647538,5,B00005QCW4,"If you are at all into great story lines/plots, action filled adventure, and witty humor, this is the DVD for you. I don't just call this any anime because it isn't. It will pull you in with the first episode. The characters are introduced and developed like that of a great novel. After finishing one episode I hated not seeing the next episode because I wanted to see what would happen next or the history of which character would be revealed next. You will defecate in your pants when you see the ending . . . trust me. The music is great too, lots of jazz, blues, techno (not mixed together). This was the first Anime I got into. I've tried your Gundam's, your DBZ's, and your Neon Avangelion's. Those are all horribly gut wrenching and make you want to shove needles in your eyes. This series is awesome, although it is for somewhat more mature viewers; a little blood and cussing never hurt anyone though. It's probably a PG rating. So all in all, just buy this DVD, you will not regret it. I promise.",1001376000,3,1007,4.419354838709677

1647546,5,B00005QCW4,"Bebop grabbed me. Some friends aren't that into it but I enjoy the characters. Ed may be my favorite but Jet's lines are the best. Faye is Faye and every script needs a troublemaker.

In terms of the product, it works fine. In terms of the show that's all personal taste.",1393372800,,271,4.313725490196078

1647549,5,B00005QCW4,"First of all I loved how fast it got here. I really didn't have to wait that long; second of all, the shipping costs weren't really costly, like an ATM fee.

Now, the discs were in great condition for how old they were and the wear and tear from play. They all play perfectly and I got to chill with some good weed, good friends and watch a good show.",1377734400,,351,4.014285714285714

1647551,5,B00005QCW4,"Bought this a few years back (for about $40, haha) and still have it! Really got into it when it started playing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Fell in love with the series, actually. I'd definitely recommend Cowboy Bebop.",1359676800,,224,4.769230769230769
1647552,5,B00005QCW4,This anime series is my favourite because it joins a jazz soundtrack with well done animation and characters you can almost relate to.  I don't believe this is drawn for younger viewers.  The audience is probably younger but more mature adults that might be fans of anime and space travel.,1357862400,,289,4.76

1647554,4,B00005QCW4,"This was a very good set, I bought it back in 2005. Different seller are selling it, but the kind I got was a very well done Chinese bootleg. It looked very official. It was a 3 Disk set, with all of the episodes uncut, so all of the blood you wouldn't see on Adult Swim, and even some scenes I had not seen before. It also had some extras, including an interview with the creator. The audio is English and Japanese. The subtitles are English, Spanish, French, Japanese, adn Chinese.

A very good deal if you get the same set that I bought.",1300752000,,540,4.1923076923076925

1647556,5,B00005QCW4,"I loved this anime when I was growing up as a kid and it was on really really late on adult swim.  It is the perfect length.  Not so short that you feel like you never got to enjoy the characters, and not so long that you'll spend half of your life trying to catch up.  I would buy this version over the american version.  It looks really cool.  The american version is not very classy.  Cowboy bebop is a wonderful story with several character arcs.  Spike is the main character and has the main character arc - one with violence, love, betrayal, and badassary.  Spike is an amazing achievement.  Spike is the cool friend of your older brother that you wish you were cool enough to talk to.  Watching cowboy bebop will be a great viewing experience.  At the very least, you'll have a cool DVD case.",1293667200,,799,4.331081081081081
1647557,5,B00005QCW4,"It's one of the best Anime shows to have ever been made. I wish they would bring the series back with new episodes. Music is great, animation is fantastic.",1289088000,,155,4.379310344827586

1647559,5,B00005QCW4,"There is something about this series that is impossible to beat. It lies in the category of stupid humor, relentless action, and serious overtones that mixes together in a kind of tossed salad of anime expectations. We have the sarcastic Faye, the ridiculous Ein and Ed, the altogether too serious Jet, and the calm, collected, but brash Spike. Combined we have a mixed sense of seriousness and hilarity.

Another thing that is fantastic about this series is the animation. It is unlike many that I have seen. Instead of a more choppy motion for most of the scenes there is a continuous flow that is unmatched. During the action scenes, the flow becomes even more fluid so that the actions are easy to follow and seamless.

The story itself may seem a bit lacking at first, but by the middle of the series you are itching for more and wondering how it's going to end.",1275350400,,867,4.587096774193548

1647561,5,B00005QCW4,"I've watched alot of anime, and I would have to say this is one that is transcendental.  I would compare it to the Sandman series in comics, the Dark Tower series in sci fi novella, to the original Star Wars in terms of originality and epicness.  It's not the typical cheese anime for teenagers, or anime that's strictly about robots and fighting, it's adult anime with mature themes.  I highly recommend it.",1231718400,,408,4.638888888888889
1647562,5,B00005QCW4,"I purchased the original, non-bootleg, limited edition copy. It came with all 6 dvds in their original case and the original soundtrack. It was used, since this is out of print, and the edges were a little worn, but well, well worth the cost of purchse! If you want original, good quality product, this is the only way to go!",1231459200,,325,4.433333333333334
1647563,5,B00005QCW4,"I'd like to address the people who gave this item a bad review due to poor quality. I'm guessing you made your purchase through an Amazon merchant rather than directly through Amazon since this item has been out of print for some time. It's likely that the item you received is a region 0 bootleg. It's pretty easy to check for this:
1-If the dvd count is lower than what is listed on the product page.
2-Chinese characters on the packaging. Chinese subtitles on the episodes are also a good indicator.
3-Doesnt have the publisher's logo on the box (in this case ""Bandai"").
4-When you insert the disc it goes straight to the menu or starts playing without showing the usual copyright, production and distributor information/titles.
  When dealing with private sellers through Amazon always be sure to ask if the item is a Region 1, official release. Asking for a picture of the exact item they are selling is also an extremely good idea.
Anyhow, I suppose I should review the product since this is a product review. Cowboy bebop is awesome. Buy it.",1230681600,4,1048,4.690217391304348

1647565,3,B00005QCW4,"Alright I am a fan of Cowboy Bebop ever since it ran on adult swim back in the day and finally got around to buying the DVD set, and this is a review for both. Lets begin with the show Cowboy Bebop is in the style of a scifi western. With great animation, character breakdown, action, and story all make an excellent story and fun interesting show . Now On the other hand it seems alot of the third party sellers are hawking a Hong Kong bootleg of the limited edition box and alot of us (myself included) have been fooled by this. Unfortunately the descriptions are misleading to the buyer and misrepresented by the sellers. The reason I have brought this up is the sound and video of these bootlegs is not at all up to par with the real set actually it is sub standard by alot. As a precaution I recommend asking for pictures of the ENTIRE set(should be numbered on the box bottom) and number of discs( 7 including the soundtrack the bootleg has 3 and no sound track)and the real set is a limited edition numbered box set(the boot leg comes in a gatefold case). Though the price at 30 dollars is a bargain you will soon realize why it is so cheap.  Personally unless you really want to have the Perfect Sessions set just get Remix it's remastered with 5.1 surround and the same show and extras as perfect sessions. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! !",1225065600,6,1340,4.317460317460317
1647566,5,B00005QCW4,"I'm very pleased about getting this set in particular. I personally don't like having the bulky 10 dvd case set, so this works for me. As for the anime itself, its great. The character development, the plot, animation, and the setting are all very well done giving a plausible and real feel to the series. It does have some funny episodes in it, ""Mushroom Samba"" for one, but it has a serious overtone in general. I would recommend getting this series if you're able to find it for cheap, and not a bootleg copy.",1224806400,,512,4.457446808510638
1647567,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy bebop is full of wit, sass, and action, clever jibes and outstanding musical score. This is a fantastic series for anyone who wants to sit down and watch something great.",1224374400,,177,4.741935483870968
1647568,5,B00005QCW4,"I bought this ""box set"" over three years ago. I definitely love watching it every once in a while. I've seen every episode a few times, and I've never done that with any show in general, and I never enthuse myself with ""Anime"" shows.

This is just a great show in general. The characters are great, the stories are great, the production, editing, drawing, music, and everything is just really entertaining.

If you like anime or not, chances are you will like this show. I've heard some people say that this version of the box set is a bootleg, or it doesn't have high quality or whatever. I'm not sure about either of those, but nothing of that sort bothered me about these DVDs.

Great buy.",1220227200,,692,4.476190476190476
1647569,4,B00005QCW4,"The item info says it's region 1, the case itself said region 2, but it played pretty well on the Playstation. We've only watched the first episode, and some of the scenes flickered, like not all the frames were there. One instance being the first time you see the ships in space. I don't remember that last time I watched it. At most other times, it was perfectly fine. The audio was great, the packaging slick and minimalistic. Haven't looked at the special features yet.
The show, as always, was amazing. Great storyline and characterization, enough silliness to make you roll your eyes, but not enough to detract from the enjoyment.",1215561600,,636,4.738738738738738
1647570,1,B00005QCW4,The item description claims 6 disks and the sound track. That is not what I received. I should have read the reviews before finalizing the purchase. The episodes are no better than the files I downloaded online. Definitely not the quality I was expecting for a product that claims is original. This is a BOOTLEG. Buyers be warned!,1208736000,9,330,4.706896551724138
1647571,5,B00005QCW4,"This anime is hands down one of the top ever made.  If you like Samurai Chaploo, then you'll likely enjoy this series.  Excellent humor, great art and action, deep characters.  Couldn't ask for more.",1208304000,,199,4.794117647058823
1647572,1,B00005QCW4,"This item as listed does not actually exist anymore.  The Perfect Sessions was a limited edition set that came in a very nice box, each of which was numbered by the manufacturer.  I found this out the hard way after I ordered it and got a bootleg.  The chances are very likely that any seller claiming to have this item is, in fact, only selling bootlegs with very bad MPEG video quality.

Amazon should really remove this listing from their service so that no more affiliates can con people like they are.

But as luck would have it, there is finally a real complete series box set out now.  Go get the Anime Legends Cowboy Bebop remix.",1203379200,34,637,4.401709401709402
1647573,5,B00005QCW4,"We watched this on cartoon network for a while, mostly out of sequence, and it is great to get it all together, and to be able to see the over-arcing storyline.  What can I say - The characters, the scifi (for which I'm a nut), the music, the wicked fight scenes... I could go on, but truly, just watch it for yourself, and enjoy!",1200614400,,330,4.15625
1647574,5,B00005QCW4,"Simply stated, this is a great anime series. Im not a big fan of anime, but I must say I was really turned onto this one. It captures you, drags you in and you'd be crazy to resist! The character development is amazing, you feel alot for the characters. It's funny, it's serious, it's cute, it's romantic, it's devastating, it's great! It's best to start anime from the beginning too, because otherwise you'll be lost forever and never understand anything, so I'd really recommend just picking up this inexpensive portal to good times and great watchin'!",1196208000,,554,4.78125
1647575,5,B00005QCW4,"You can read all about the actual series in the many glowing reviews, and I completely agree. This is by far the best thing Ive watched on television, period. I just wanted to comment on the actual package I got delivered. Its all four dvds in a single case. I was expecting a box set, and this tiny package came in the mail today. That just makes me like it that much more, as I have very little room in my DVD collection to spare.

Im now going to waste hours going through this series every night for probably the next week.",1193011200,,527,4.166666666666667
1647576,2,B00005QCW4,"This is one of the truly greatest animated series ever made.  Several people may say that about shows like inuyasha and dragon ball Z but I personally have found both of those and many others rather ridiculous.  Of course, I am one of those anime lovers that find 95% of it not very entertaining and rather strange.

This is a very cheap way to get your hands on this entire series but it does have some caveats.  The image quality and sound are tolerable but rather crappy compared to buying the individual discs or the more expensive sets.  This is one of those anime's that can be really beautiful on a nice TV with a good sound system.  If you have the money and a means to view it in all its glory I would recommend going the alternative route (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboy-Bebop-Complete-Sessions-Collection-Amazon-com-Exclusive/dp/B00007LLIV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboy Bebop Complete Sessions Collection (Amazon.com Exclusive)</a>) rather than this one.

Also, if you are merely curious about the series and have never seen it I would suggest checking out the movie, which I think is AWESOME (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboy-Bebop-The-Movie/dp/B00005JMBJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboy Bebop - The Movie</a>).

1647577,4,B00005QCW4,"Many comments have been made about the bootlegged three disc version versus the original release. Before checking my sources, I ordered the 3 disc version quickly after seeing the appealing price tag. Shortly thereafter did I read about people's horrible experiences with these sets, and dreaded the days until it arrived. When it arrived, I popped in disc 1 and was pleasantly surprised.

The video quality on the copy I received was perfectly on par with the Bandai Release of ""Remix vol. 1"". The subtitles were solid and well done. The menus were not flashy, but easily navigable and set up very well.

I suppose this is just a testament to certain boot-leggers and their attention to detail when making a good DVD set. I have had no problem or complaint with any aspect of my DVD set. My only complaint is with the packaging, which is a simple two disc standard case with a hanging third disc holder. It is solid and looks fine, but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. However, that can be overlooked as I watch all 26 sessions of Cowboy Bebop is crisp quality.",1190592000,7,1066,4.634920634920635

1647579,5,B00005QCW4,"I'm not big into cartoons.  The only anime I watch are things that have already been critically acclaimed (like ""Princess Mononoke,"" and ""Akira"") so when I say that this is excellent, you know it isn't coming from a biased otaku nerd (no offense, nerds :D).  The animation is superb.  The soundtrack is astonishing (it's so good, I have it on my iPod!).  But what really runs the show is the characters.  The plot of each of the episodes is pretty much stand-alone (so you don't necessarily NEED to see them in any particular order), and the individual plots really aren't anything to get up and cheer about.  But the characters and emotions, and (my favorite) the voiceovers are enough to get me to cry at the end of the last episode.  The american voiceover actors are what make the ridiculous parts of the show believable.  Spike is just plain cool, Jet is the much-needed voice of reason, Faye is the loose-cannon, take-no-crap female, and Ed is the often over-the-top, sometimes annoying comic relief.  They are what run this show.  It is fun, beautiful, ugly, emotional, funny, and serious all at the same time.  It is good all-around (even though the DVDs themselves are possible bootlegs).  It is a cartoon geared toward adults, and it is spot-on when it comes to performance.  Very good - highly reccommended.",1189296000,3,1318,4.778761061946903

I admit it.  I should have paid closer attention to what I was buying here.  I, too, wound up with a bootleg and I'm presently working it out with the vendor.  I take my share of responsibilty on this.  The deal was good, maybe too good.  I should have known . . .

But Amazon has a responsibility, too.  Reading through these reviews, this is not the first time this has happened.  Amazon should know-at least by now- that most of these offers are illegal bootlegs and should shut down these vendors.

Trust me.  I'll be much more careful now.",1188604800,12,583,4.305555555555555

I'd suggest, if you're just touching on anime for the first time, that you start here. Cowboy Bebop is one of the great anime series, and is funny, intelligent, atmospheric, and generally well rounded in its balance of these factors with action, character development, and overall entertainment.

If you think there is any chance you're interested in anime, buy this.

If you're already into anime, there's no reason you shouldn't have seen it by now.

Just make sure you buy a real issue and not the bootleg, as quality is lacking, and bootlegging is stealing.",1187913600,3,659,4.857142857142857

I saw the empty box selling for $120 the other day.  The characters are a mismatched crew of bounty hunters trying to make a living in a not too distant future when humanity has moved out to the plants and taken most of our vices and bad habits with us.  Thankfully, we've taken some of our humanity, caring and love for our fellow human kind as well.  The stories seem a bit childish on the surface, but if you watch closely, you'll see a mirror of our modern society just below the surface of every episode.  The music is just about the best part of the show.  Classic Jazz Man.",1187740800,4,736,4.2898550724637685

1647586,5,B00005QCW4,"Ok, so Cowboy Bebop is a great show.  Here's the deal.  The sellers who are selling this new are selling you a bootleg.  The set simply isn't being manufactured anymore.  The real thing has 7 discs all together 6 DVDs, and 1 Audio CD.  The sets that sre being sold here (unless they are used and expensive) are usually 3 discs, maybe 4 or 5 if they throw in a copy of the movie, and the soundtrack.  So, please be aware of this.  I wasn't when I went into this, and wound up with a $50 bootleg.

So, what does that mean for you, the person who wants the show, but doesn't want to sign over their firstborn?  Well, the set isn't too bad.  The episodes are compressed down to 9 per disc.  Some people have complained about the video, or audio.  I found it pretty good!  If your trying to watch this on your whiz-bang 90 bajillion inch HDTV, then I'm sure you'll notice some artifacting, and things like that.  But then you can probably afford to shell out a minimum of $125 (or $350 for the legitimate Perfect Sessions) for a 26 episode TV show.  For the rest of you the video is of suprising quality as is the audio.  The languages, and subtitles are intact.

I'll admit that I am somewhat morally conflicted over this.  The people who created the show deserve to be compensated for it.  But I feel that I paid a fair price ($49, when it's as cheap as $25) and that if Bandai was REALLY that interested in milking a few more bucks out of me they'd make a less expensive set.  Just be sure that you get the FX copy, and you'll be ok.",1181001600,4,1531,4.178082191780822

1647588,5,B00005QCW4,"First of all, Cowboy Bebop is an amazing collection of animation.  The stories and characters are very involving.  I originally caught an episode on Adult Swim and was hooked, so I had to get the whole set.

Cowboy Bebop has been released on DVD in many different versions.  Beware or you will not get what you expect.  The original series was first released on 6 individual discs.  These are available used.  Later, The Perfect Sessions 6 DVD boxed set was released in limited quantities at an MSRP of $250.  Each box is numbered.  These are no longer available for sale except on auction sites.  Cowboy Bebop Remix is the a 6 DVD set containing a Dolby surround remix of the original audio.

A cheaper, 3 disc set was created and released in Asia.  This is the set you find commonly offered for sale for $20 or less.  Compressing 6 DVDs worth of material onto 3 discs involves large amounts of compression so many people are disappointed when they pay $20 and expect a $250 set.  You get what you pay for!

1647592,4,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop is quite possibly the perfect anime, especially for those who do not really like anime but would like to try it. The stories and characters are incredible, and the attention-grabbing music (mostly jazz) enhances the experience even greater. There is at least one episode for literally every kind of genre fan, from the horror cringer, all the way to the romance lover.

The basic continous story is the adventures, and sometimes misadventures, of (eventually) four space-travelling bounty hunters and a genious K9 in pusuit of bounty heads, which occassionally delve into one of the four characters' dark, but interesting pasts.

As for the actual DVD, it is not bad, especially for the price. The three-disk set comes complete with Japanese and English audio and English subtitles. Sadly, there are no bonus features, but some can be found on the DVD to the Cowboy Bebop movie which uses the same cast and crew. There is occassionally a pixelation problem in a few mere episodes, due to the fact that these are bootlegs, but it in no way distracts from the episode, unless you are actively looking for problems rather than watching the show. The judgement that the quality compares to a VHS is pretty much accurate, but like I said, it does not distract unless you want it to. The only real annoyance I found was in the transition of the menus, but it is no long-lasting or really important problem.

This low-priced set of the entire 26 episodes is such a great deal that anyone, even someone unfamiliar with the show, should not pass up this offer.",1168646400,,1564,4.806691449814126

Really glad I got to see this one.  Bought it for about $30 and got the 3 disc set with the movie as a bonus with the set,  so 4 discs in all.

I'll bet what you're debating is whether or not it's a waste to shell out the 30 bucks for the bootleg.  In my experience, usually that's a no; I've got a few anime-hound friends, and I've seen some bootlegs that were probably recorded on someone's 8mm camera pointed at the TV.

  I bought my copy of this a few years ago before finding out it was actually a 300 buck collector's thing, and all I can compare it to is a real copy of 1st session (the first couple of episodes).

But i had still never seen the whole series all the way through. And I thought getting the whole series for less than eighty bucks was a pipe-dream. Well turns out this four-disc set is not only all 26 full length episodes, but it also comes with the Cowboy Bebop movie. All this for forty dollars.

Love the series. It is by far the best Anime series i've ever seen. The music is what sells it for me. Just a wellspring of great songs from all different Genres. Funny thing, I've had the soundtracks to Cowboy Bebop for a while and it's fun to see where the all so familiar songs fit within the storyline. The storyline is superb. Each episode can function as a standalone story, but there is a continuous plot development throughout the series. Characters are awesome. The voice actors from Japan and America are also match-made for the characters in the story. (I prefer the  English dubbing, surprisingly. I'm usually partial to subtitles, but the English voice actors are extremely talented.) Extra features are nothing special, though. They're just short, short interviews with the Japanese cast and development. There is one kindof cool music video though.

It's a great setting for the story too. Think of it as when your grandchildren would be your grandfather's age. This quasi-futuristic feel keeps 20th century familiarity, but gives you a glimpse into the possible future.

The ""perfect"" sessions are a real trip, but I would call Cowboy Bebop the perfect series.

1647601,5,B00005QCW4,"First off, the series Cowboy Bebop is an outstanding show.

... BUT, the set described here and the set being sold through the vendors links are NOT the same set.

If you' re paying $30 or so, you're most likely getting a Chinese release, which, while it will play just fine on any DVD player (it's ""zone-free""), the entire series had been compressed to fit on 3 DVDs instead of 6, at the expense of picture quality.  The Chinese release _does_ have the full English audio, as well as Japanese-with-English-subtitles, but the default is Chinese and you have to change the audio setting when you play it each time.

If you just want a copy of the series, this may work just fine (it is what I bought...), but be aware that you are NOT getting full picture quality with the Chinese release.  The American release, however, is MUCH more expensive, so it all depends on what you want for what price.",1128384000,,895,4.5
1647602,5,B00005QCW4,"No, I haven't seen the DVDs. But, I have seen the entire series on Adult Swim, and I'll tell you that this Anime is surly one of the best I've seen. I started seeing this show when my friends said it was the best Anime out there. So, I sat down and watched it...I wasn't this impressed since the Tenchi series.

Yes, the show has it's faults, such as: being a little incoherent and confusing. But that's the beauty: each episode is like a painting, each one is unique and impressive but not quite linked together. And that's what makes it interesting.
Here's a little info on the show below:

It has been suggested that the success of Cowboy Bebop is due in large part to the layered nature of its storyline. While the general plot concerns a team of bounty hunters set in a world of the future, the story revolves foremost around the characters and their interactions. Each character has a distinct back story that shapes his outlook, personality, interpersonal interactions, ambitions, desires and motivations.

The multiple layers and deep characters combined with a very free-flowing feel to the story itself (heavily influenced by American culture, especially the jazz movements of the 1940s, hence ""bebop"") and a large number of action sequences (from space battles to hand-to-hand combat) that were considered well-choreographed make Cowboy Bebop widely-respected and well-liked by many who have seen it.

In the year 2071, the crew of the ship, Bebop, travel around the solar system, trying to catch ""bounty-heads."" In the slang of the era, ""cowboys"" are bounty hunters, hence the name of the series. Each member of the Bebop crew contribute their own unique abilities to help catch bounty heads. Most episodes revolve around a bounty, however the real focus of the show concerns the pasts of each character, which unravel and connect as the series progresses.

The main plot line focuses on Spike Spiegel, who's syndicate past begins to catch up with him three years after he left. The secondary plot deals with Faye Valentine, a woman who's past is a mystery to even herself. She too, must deal with her past, as well as her debt ridden present.

The story of Spike's partner Jet Black is also told, and it mirrors the story of Spike's former partner Vicious. The story of hacker Edward also mirrors Faye's story, though it's only really explored in one episode.

Spike Spiegel
A 27-year-old bounty hunter who was born on Mars. Spike was a powerful member the Red Dragon crime syndicate, where he was partnered with a man named Vicious. Spike was unhappy within the syndicate, and after a falling out with his partner (it's alluded in the series that Spike's affair with a woman named Julia was the cause), Spike faked his death to free himself from the organization.
Some time after his ""death"", Spike met up with bounty hunter Jet Black, and the two men became partners. Spike moved onto Jet's ship, named the ""Bebop"", and the two men worked together for about three years before being joined by the rest of the crew.

In appearance, Spike is tall and thin, but with muscular sholders. He's got green fuzzy hair, and brown eyes, one of which is lighter than the other. This is due to a cybernetic prosthetic that Spike had implanted some time before he left the syndicate. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. Spike also usually has a cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or ""no smoking"" signs.

Spike has many talents and abilities, making him an excellent bounty hunter. He has very sharp eyesight, and abnormally acute perception. Spike makes use of sleight-of-hand techniques, using them to win card games, pick pockets, and even to slip things onto other people unoticed. But where Spike really excels is in combat. He is well versed in weaponry (such as his personal Jericho 941 as well as other guns and explosives) and hand-to-hand combat skills. He specializes in Jeet Kune Do, the fighting style created by Bruce Lee. Spike is also an excellent pilot, and flies a converted Astroid racer called ""Swordfish II"".

When he's not working or praticing his martial arts skills, Spike is very laid-back and lackadaisical, often a source of consternation for his crewmates. Most of the other Bebop crew think he's a ""lunkhead"" due to his happy-go-lucky attitude, and generally Spike just takes life as it comes. However, behind the the sleepy facade, Spike is heartbroken over the loss of Julia, who disappeared rather than follow him away from the syndicate.

Spike's philosophy seems to be based on the ancient samurai ideals of immediacy: considering oneself as dead, and the idea of death being an awakening from a dream; these are both elements of Bushido illustrated in the Hagakure.

Jet Black
Jet, a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede, acts as Spike's foil during the series. Where Spike acts lazy and uninterested, Jet is hard-working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in a sting that went awry. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb, but his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, and enjoys jazz/blues music, especially Charlie Parker. As a character, Jet is a quintessential oyaji.
During the series, it's revealed the Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rynt is wanted for murder. Jet the ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.

In a later episode, another Vicious/Jet parallel is set up when Jet find out that it was his old partner Fad betrayed him. Thought in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved. Fad simply set up Jet to be killed, though luckly Jet survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face.

Jet is skilled with handguns, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand comabat as well, though unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot, and flys a ship called ""Hammerhead"". Jet is the owner of the ""Bebop"", and it's to his consternation when Faye moves in without asking.

Faye Valentine
Faye is vice personified. Twenty-three years old (though she was actually born 77 years ago and cryogenically frozen before the gate accident), she is corrupt, mercenary, and totally self-centered. Being a bounty hunter is conducive to her independent-minded lifestyle. Kleptomaniacal and addicted to gambling, Faye uses her skimpy attire and significant sex appeal to get whatever she wants. However, her vain and merciless exterior hides a frightened girl. Stored in cryogenic sleep for 54 years due to a space travel accident, Faye awoke with total amnesia in a mysterious world that she didn't understand, surrounded by people who were all-too-willing to take advantage of her navet&eacute;, which hardened her personality. The surname ""Valentine"" was merely a name given to her by the doctor that thawed her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. She also expresses a concealed attraction and concern for Spike during choice moments, such as watching over him after an encounter with Vicious, showing concern before his challenge to the assassin Mad Pierrot, and finally, as he left the Bebop never to come back alive. It was hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth.

Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV
The assumed name of an elite netdiver from Earth, Ed is a very strange young girl (assumed to be about 13). Ed could be considered a ""free spirit."" She is a font of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor. Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, or even just saunter. Not much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage. (A man named Applederry Siniz Hesap Lutfen eventually claims to be her father and called her Franoise.) Ed's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is a genius behind a computer, possibly the best ever. Ed has a good rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein the dog.

I've read some of the other reviews and there are comments stating that you can't turn off subtitles and the menu navigation does not work correctly. This was not true in my case. The set that I recieved I had not realized that it was a bootleg copy until I read these reviews. The discs look professionaly made with real silkscreened graphics.

However, the video quality is not as good as the real thing. There are obvious compression artifacts, especially during scenes with a lot of movement.

The limited run of this collection has completly sold out, and now certian retailers have jacked up the price on their remaining stock. The Import Version will be able to run on your DVD player, but the image quality doesn't match the official USA releases (you'll find some minor pixilation problems). The Perfect Sessions package does give you all the episodes, along with some nice extras. But honestly, its hard to recommend the over-blown $200 price for only one disc of extras (the $150 price is a little better), and virtualy the same audio and video quality of the previous Bandai DVD releases.

Cowboy Bebop is a suberb example of what anime is all about, which makes it the perfect series to show people that never really liked the older Japanaese animation shows (like Speed Racer). You're better off getting the previous Session 1-6 on DVD from Bandai, which will cost you less than half to get ($60-80 depending if you want new or used copies), and waiting for a re-release of the Perfect Sessions collection -- in some form or another, we hope. If one disc of bonus features and a Limited Collectors box is not worth an extra $70-100 to you, just get the individually DVDs.",1126224000,2,1430,4.607843137254902
1647607,5,B00005QCW4,"I heard about Cowboy Bebop from a friend while discussing Firefly; he said that CB, one of his favorite shows, was very similar to Firefly, one of my favorite shows.  I decided to check it out even though anime hasn't really enticed me in the past.  What I discovered was one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.

Set about 6 decades in the future, the show follows the exploits of bounty hunters Spike Spiegel, a nimble fighter, and Jet Black, an older man with a robotic arm.  The pair run their operations out of a converted fishing boat called the Bebop.  Both of them have hidden pasts that they choose not to share with each other, claiming that the past is past and it no longer matters.  They depend on the money they receive from turning in bounty heads in order to survive.  If they don't succeed for a while, they run out of food.  Early on in the series, Faye Valentine, a new passenger with an equally shadowy past and a slight gambling problem, joins the crew.  Also, they acquire an extremely talented (and very eccentric) hacker named Edward (who is actually a girl) as well as a genetically enhanced dog named Ein.

Each character has their own story arc that is carried out over the course of these 26 episodes, and eventually, each character's past is revealed, much to their chagrin.  However, Spike is definitely the main character.  He is the most interesting character and has the most interesting story, which includes my favorite character, an assassain named Vicious.  That's not to say the other characters aren't interesting, because they are, just that Spike has the best story.

While there is the occasional misfire (like Toys in the Attic and Mushroom Samba), most of the episodes are very well done.  They have compelling and interesting stories, good action, as well as some humor.  While the English voice-overs are a little weak at times, it doesn't take too much away from the show overall.

I was very lucky to come across this great show; it has quickly become one of my favorite shows, and I highly reccomend it to anyone who is an anime fan, a sci-fi fan, a western fan, or an action fan.",1126051200,,2131,4.595238095238095

The bootlegs were able to run on my DVD player with some minor pixilation problems, though the video quality was poor compared to the legal disks.

I have been a big fan of Bandai for years, and am grateful to them for producing such magnificent series as Mobile Suit Gundam, and Bebop. I am very saddened to learn that I acquired a bootleg. Do yourself a favor, and get the original disks instead. Don't let illegal bootleggers steal profit from great anime companies!

And if you're an Anime Fan or an Otaku, or even not, I expect, and hope that you have this Series. Just had to get that out. Lol. Anyway, this Anime is about 5 bounty hunters (Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th, and Ein [it's so sad that quite a few people forget about poor little Ein, I mean come on])on an Adventure to find their past, as well as many other things, and though a lot of people find this Series to be a part Comedy, I do not. To me, there is only a little bit of humor, though definitely enough to satisfy me, but for the most part it's a Action/Drama, and also a Adventure, and to some little extent, a Romance Anime. It has every Genre, and heck, like the creators said: ""The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... Cowboy Bebop,"" and to me, and probably many others, it is. I really don't know many Anime Fans or Otakus that haven't seen this Series, but... if you're just coming around to Anime, I will say to you: DEFINITELY buy this Series first.

Like most people, i had never watched anime until recently,(thankyou adult swim!) but as I sat watching fullmetal alchemist(also really really great)I instantly fell in love and greedily got my hands on anything with the word ""anime"" or ""manga"".Forgive me, but I am over the stage of obsession onto something somewhat more pathetic. But hey! who cares!.

  So, as the night progressed and i stayed anchored to the couch until 2 in the morning, cowboy bebob, the holyness unto itself, came on. I have never seen something like this before. I'm fourteen years old and i was under the impression that anime was centered around fuzzy yellow mice whole stick their fingers in electric sockets, but alas! There are no mice here.

  At first, i was apprehensive to spend my prescious funds on something I had no knowledge of, but still, i couldn't resist.(This was only after one episode mind you) But now, as you can plainly see, it was well worth it.

  I found a really good deal on ebay and purchased the perfect sesons(3 discs, i'm viraully broke ALL of the time) and the movie: knocking on heaven's door. I was so intrigued, that I watched all 26 episodes in one day(Sleep? who needs sleep?)

  Now, aside from harping my life's story to you, I will try to explain why this anime is one of the elite.

  The characters are so intricatly woven into the plot that you very well feel as though you are looking into the future(Its based in the future. In space) Spike Spiegel (the lead character, although, throughout the series, that position fluctuates) is a tortured soul who past is constatly catching up with him. Now, I know that sounds cliched, but it is different, trust me and in a  good way. After leaving his past behind him, he joins a cyborg/retired cop named Jet Black. They become bounty hunters(hence the name cowboy bebops)and scour the universe in search of the big catch, something that will permanatly raise their constantly depleted funds. Along the way, they meet and join with three characters, all whom have problems of their own that are original and intresting(I won't tell you precisely who they are. You'll just have to watch)

  As the 25 and 26 episodes finally came to a close, I cried  (dont make fun of me, and even if you shake your head and say ""silly girl, its just  cartoon"". i won't care, because people are stuck on the false notion that cartoons are just for children. If you do, you are sadly mistaken) The ending was so perfect and emotional, i haven't been able to watch it again.

  The music is amazing, kudos to Yokko Kanno(sp?). The animation is never to flashy, just perfect and the characters are never to pretty or unproportionate. Its realistic, and I think that is what cements its constatly growing fanbase.

  Please, do yourself a favor and buy anything that even hints cowboy bebop. you won't regret it.",1120176000,5,2918,4.670588235294118

My wife went online to Amazon to get me a birthday gift a couple of weeks ago and she went looking for the complete Cowboy Bebop series.  She found this and thought perhaps it was a fluke in the pricing since the stat page says ""7discs.""  She ordered this one and she loves me.  I have a wife who gives me anime.  I am lucky.

But this set only has three discs.  Yes, it does have every episode from the series but there are ZERO special features.  No behind the scenes or anything like I know the original is supposed to have.

The video quality is OK.  Slightly better than if you recorded it off of the TV with a VCR.  Not great, but not bad.  I will stay with this copy though because it was a gift, but I really have to recommend paying the money for the official 6-disc version.  If you just want the episodes, then get this.

If possible, I would recommend watching ""The Ballad of Fallen Angels"" (session 1 episode 5) first before committing to buying the entire series.  That being said, I happened to buy the box set, and I don't necessarily regret it.  However, perhaps I'm a bit of a harsher critic than others.  While it's entertaining most of the time and the animation is beautiful to look at and the music is great, I didn't feel emotionally drawn in.

The setting is the not too distant future, and the main characters are an eclectic group of bounty hunters in outter space.  There's Spike (the protaganist) the anti-hero with a mysterious past, Jet the former cop, Faye the beautiful hustler, and Ed the child computer genius who's cute but borders on annoying.  The premise allows for many adventures, but it's all with an ""easy come,easy go"" attitude.  The characters are all kind of too cool to care about anything, and so I found that I didn't really care about them that much either.  I wished that there was more development in the characters' relationships.  But I suppose being a bounty hunter means you're sort of a lone wolf.

A few of the episodes give us a peek into Spike's dark past, and these were the most intriguing episodes.  I got hooked on this series because of ""Ballad of Falled Angels"" and the final two episodes.

However, time and time again, anime after anime, everything falls short to the Bebop.  Prolly cause Spike shot em... anyways.

The Japanese version is actually pretty pathetic.  If you want the class act (literally) then you need to watch the English dubbed version.  Precise, thought-out, and superbly done acting by the voices of everyone.  Even the ""extras,"" if you will, have talent and show it.

There is no real ""fan service,"" as it's put, in Bebop.  You don't need it.  Instead, they focus on doing a great job.  Panties are literally the least of your concerns... well... Fay does make your mind wander every now and then.

Something different happens in every episode like crazy animal right's activists trying to mutate every human on earth. Most of them are not cliche. Only a couple are but they're still good.

The characters are great. None of them become annoying as the series went on. Their differing personalities compliment each other- one crazy, one sassy, one serious, and a little cocky one to finish up the gang.

I would have given this series five stars if it wasn't so short. I was so disappointed when it ended all of a sudden. I wanted a lot more, like 26 more episodes. I would have loved to had the main dilema of the story greatly expanded on, not cut short.

My first 15 episodes were sent to me via internet by a friend who thought might like them by the time I got through ""Jupiter Jazz Part II"" I was so completely hooked that I set out to buy the perfect sessions along with the movie and the sound tracks, and that's where I'll start the gushing.

The music for this anime is a treat all by itself, it runs the gamut of Jazz, Blues, Rock, Country and even a bit of techno pop, it complements the animation so well that just hearing a song can instantly remind you of that exact moment in the series.

The style of animation is so perfectly suited to the story line and characters that I honestly couldn't see it any other way, neo-jazz anime at it's best.

That leaves us with the story line and from the other reviews here I don't think I need to say much, but I will say that they will almost always leave you wanting to see the next episode.

From comedy to drama and plenty of action the pace changes just enough to keep the stories from becoming stale and rarely if ever will an episode be predictable.

In short this is a fantastic anime endeavor and should be a part of everyones movie collection.",1104624000,6,1216,4.265217391304348
1647640,3,B00005QCW4,"Unfortunately, I have neither Cartoon Network nor a decent (non-bootleg) version of this to go on, but I will rate on the merits of the episodes alone.

I really wanted to like Cowboy Bebop, being the most popular anime series in both Japan and the United States.  I've been looking for a great anime series that has as deep an impact as Neon Genesis Evangelion, but I've yet to find it.  I'm not an anime fan, per se, but a fan of great storytelling.  Anime is just a style of animation.  Great stories transcend all styles in books, film, traditional animation, CG and yes, anime.

Cowboy Bebop is not a great story.

It's not a bad show, but I can't use any words nicer than 'okay'.  The voice acting is great, the English dub even better than the original Japanese at times (sometimes I couldn't tell the Japanese Spike and Jet apart, they sounded so similar).  The music is great, the animation always looks splendid, with beautiful CG blended in nicely, and of note are several shots that look like hand-held camera in some action scenes.  But I can't get past the story that the show doesn't seem to want to tell.

For major complaints, the character of Ed is appalling.  Her presence is pointless and completely irritating.  The show would've been so much better with a better fourth character that wasn't always making stupid noises or singing every line of dialogue, or even no fourth character at all.  The dynamic of just Spike, Jet and Faye was fine.

Another complaint is that the show completely loses its credibility at least once in the show.  While I never complain about hearing sound in space when in reality, you can't hear anything in a vacuum, a laughable occurance in one episode where Spike takes a DEEP BREATH and hurls himself into space!  If you need a lesson in physics, if you tried that, the vacuum would suck the air out from your nostrils, the muscles in your lips wouldn't be able to stay shut from the pressure, it'd even get sucked out of your pores.

Back to the story, though.  The most interesting parts of the show is when they focus on character development, which is few and far between.  After it was all over, I wanted to know more about these people (except Ed, of course).  Why did Spike throw everything away?  Why is Viscious the way he is?  If Julia was looking for Spike, why didn't she go with him in the first place?  What else happened in the three years since Faye rose from her coma?  When and why did Jet team up with Spike?  You find yourself asking these questions and more and you'll never find an answer outside of fan-fiction.

Most episodes, unfortunately, need absolutely no exposition and wrap themselves up neatly (or slightly untidy) by the episode's end.  You can take several of the stories out between the first and last two episodes and you wouldn't know that you missed anything.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of them are pretty good, but they're often too interchangeable and too generic to be distinguishable from other shows.  Bebop simply fails to take advantage of being a series.  A great show is able to have both long-term story arcs as well as an individual story to each episode.  It's a delicate balance that I feel the writers of the show never even tried to maintain.

The tone of the show is also very inconsistent.  It can be dark, deep, funny or silly.  Most of the time it's just silly.  If the show focused more on being more serious, I would've liked it a lot more.  The show can be all of it, but again, it lacks balance.  Masters like Joss Whedon know how to do this right without making funny or silly moments off-putting.

The show is definitely worth watching, but maybe not worth owning.  By the end of the show, I was left wondering what the point of it all was.  When I think of Cowboy Bebop, I think of a show that could've been so much better than it was.

If you haven't done so already, if you want a great anime show with a great story, watch both the Neon Genesis Evangelion series and movies.  Just be prepared for an ending you may not like, and even if you like the ending like I do, it's still not the ending you may have wanted.  If you want a great sci-fi/fantasy show about a group of space vagabonds, watch Firefly.",1101686400,3,4224,4.465359477124183

this old saying works here, but not completely.

at first glance, i could definitely tell the video quality was that of a VCR taped off version of the show.  so if you absolutely must have super awesome picture quality, stay away from this.  things get grainy in certain spots and there are little red dots that appear on screen every once in a while.

1647643,1,B00005QCW4,"What is a bootleg?

For our purposes, the technical definition of a bootleg is: any illegal copy of video or audio. That can mean everything from a program that you tape on television and pass on to a friend (yes, that's technically illegal) to someone ""producing"" a professional looking DVD or CD of intellectual material that they do not own the rights to.

Now, in anime fandom there are some grays when it comes to what is ""permissible"" as far as bootlegs go. For example, I don't think that anyone, no matter how hard-line they are against bootlegging, would think that it is wrong to copy an anime on tape from a Japanese broadcast and send it to your friend in another country. It may be technically illegal, but I doubt that even the anime companies would object to this; after all, it's free advertising.

The next level of bootlegging creates more of a controversy, however: fansubs. Fansubbing is an ""industry"" that (as far as I can tell) is entirely unique to anime. A fansub is an anime video which has been subtitled by amateur translators, generally fans. They are not professionally done, and are usually free. If you ever pay more than the cost of materials/shipping on a fansub, you're getting ripped off. While fansubs are generally passed over with a wink and a smile (even by some anime companies), there are a few things to remember if you want to get a fansub:

Never get a fansub of an anime that's been picked up commercially. Fansubs are not a cheap replacement for the legit product.

If you've bought a fansub of a program, you should buy the legit product when it's released in your area. Otherwise the legitimate companies lose money from fansubs (and eventually go out of business), which hopefully no one wants.

Incidentally, these rules apply to downloadable fansubs as well. I find it shocking how many people (in the US) think it's A-OK to download episodes of Cowboy Bebop off of a file sharing client, despite the fact that it's commercially available in the United States. This is the perfect plan, if you want to sabotage anime in the US; if you want to see more anime released in this country, however, buy the DVDs. If you can't afford the DVDs, then stick to the television broadcasts.

There are some people who find fansubs objectionable, period. I am not one of those people. However, I do not think that there's any excuse to buy a fansub if the video you want is commercially available in your country. Buying a fansub under those conditions is called ""stealing.""

The next level of bootlegging is people who buy anime DVDs or VHS, make VCD or VHS copies of the programs, and sell them on Ebay. I think this is pretty obviously wrong to most everyone, and (hopefully) you can all recognize this sort of thing when you see it.

And then there are ""professional"" bootleggers. To me, these people are the most despicable, not only because they sell bootlegs but because they try to fool their customers into believing what their buying is legitimate. Many people have been fooled by these shysters. (I was of them, unfortunately, until I wised up.) Because they package their bootlegs almost exactly the same way that the American or Japanese companies do, it can be difficult to recognize a bootleg. However, there are certain warning signs to let you know whether what you're buying is a bootleg or legit.

Recognizing video bootlegs

I don't think I need to explain how to spot the copies that people make with their DVD burners and whatnot; those should be easy to spot. Obviously, if there are way to many episodes on one VCD, then you know it's just someone burning their DVDs to VCD. If you think that you do need some explanation in spotting generic bootlegs, send me an e-mail and I'll add one to this FAQ.

No, the real problem, as I've said many times, are the Hong Kong/Taiwanese bootleggers who create complete duplicates of other people's work, and thus fool many people into buying second-rate products. Those are a little harder to spot, but there are some warning signs:

An anime DVD produced in either Taiwan or Hong Kong should be your first tip-off. I am sure that there are legitimate video companies in these countries; however, thanks to lax copyright laws in these countries, most ""professional"" looking bootlegs generally come either Taiwan or Hong Kong. Therefore, seeing ""imported from Hong Kong"" or ""imported from Taiwan"" should at the very least put you on your guard.

Anime bootlegs will invariably be subtitled in both English and Chinese. They might also include an English dub. But the important thing to notice are the English and Chinese subtitles in conjunction. Most (but not all) legitimate companies do not release anime with both Chinese and English subtitles. This is one of the surest signs of a bootleg.

Bootlegs are always no region/all region - or in other words, they can be played on any DVD player. Once again, this is something that is almost universally not true for legitimate releases. There's one obscure Korean release of an anime that was all region, but so far that's the only one I've ever heard of. If the disk you're about to buy is all region, beware.

The bootlegged disks will be incredibly cheap, especially when compared to the prices of legitimate disks. Full bootlegged series usually run about $35-$50, far cheaper than a legitimate company could get away with, because it costs money to author the disks, buy the necessary licenses, etc. Since bootleggers sidestep the expensive legal issues, they can afford to sell their disks for very cheaply. Remember: if the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.

Most of the time, the bootlegged product will include fewer disks than the legit version. In the case of Cowboy Bebop, all the bootlegs that I've seen contain 3 disks. It should be obvious that this is a bootleg; the American release of the series was on 6 disks, the Japanese on even more than that. There simply aren't any legitimate companies that will put 8-9 episodes of a series on one disk. The most I've seen is 7 episodes per disk, and those included no extras. There are some exceptions to this rule; for example, I've seen bootlegs of Slayers that were on just as many disks as the legitimate version; so how many disks the video is on will not necessarily help you, but it's a good secondary indicator.

Bootlegs tend to be badly translated. Again, this is a secondary indicator, and isn't always true. The main Cowboy Bebop bootleg that's selling on Ebay is a direct rip of the ""Perfect Sessions"" set that is being sold by Bandai in the USA, so it has Bandai's professional translation (here's a front view of this bootleg). However, this bootleg of the series, and this one as well have very bad translations, due to the fact that they are translated from Japanese to Chinese and then to English. As you can imagine, such a roundabout translation makes for some very low quality dialog.

Video quality can also be a secondary indicator of a bootleg. This indicator isn't as reliable as some of the others, but if you're watching a DVD video and you're disappointed at the quality, then it's possible that you own a bootleg.

These companies are known bootleggers: ""Animation Video,"" ""Anime Cartoon/Manga International"" (not to be confused with Manga Entertainment), ""Fx"" and ""Anime Studio."" (This is not a comprehensive list)

Recognizing CD bootlegs

Now, CD bootlegs are slightly trickier to spot, since there aren't as many discrepancies between the bootlegs and the originals, but if you look carefully you'll know a bootleg from a legit CD. There are really only three signs of a CD bootleg:

The CD will be made by either SonMay or EverAnime; both of those companies are well-known CD bootleggers. This is an example of the SonMay logo, and here's one of the EverAnime logo. Even if you can't spot these logos on the CDs themselves, you can usually ask the seller and they'll tell you if they were produced by one of these companies.

If it's a bootleg, it will be sold (new, usually) very cheaply. The thing you have to understand about import Japanese CDs is that not only are they going to be more expensive than a domestic CD, but that you also have to consider shipping charges. The prices at which the CD bootlegs usually sell is around $10 (sometimes more, sometimes less). For a legit Japanese CD, that might just barely cover the shipping charges. If someone can afford to charge that little for a Japanese CD and they aren't running at a loss, then something fishy is up. This is a good sign that what you're being sold is a bootleg.

And finally, if the CD is imported from either Hong Kong or Taiwan, odds are that it's a bootleg. Just like with video piracy, copyright laws aren't very strongly enforced in these two nations. As such, they are prime locations for bootleggers.

Probably the best way to protect yourself from being swindled with a bootleg is to learn something about the legitimate products from sites like Anime on DVD. Also, there's are other bootleg articles that go into more detail than this FAQ, and might be of some help:

Animenation's Ask John offers some help on spotting bootlegs.

Another piracy FAQ by Anime Digital that goes into more depth.

I hope that this FAQ is of some use to you folks. I certainly hope that I haven't encouraged anyone to seek bootlegs. The main lesson here is: buyer beware. Just because it looks legit, doesn't mean that it is. And no matter how tempting it is to purchase a bootleg of an expensive Japanese item, please keep in mind that Japan is in economic crisis right now, and think about how horrible it would be if your favorite anime company (like say, Sunrise, the creators of Cowboy Bebop) were to go out of business because no one is spending money on their product. I know it's tough to buy those import CDs, I know it's tough to wait and save up for the DVD set you want, but waiting is preferable to the alternative. If you have further questions that you think should be answered on this FAQ, please e-mail me.",1097971200,50,10044,4.694144400227402
1647644,5,B00005QCW4,"That quote is from my Japanese roommate who finally sat down and watched my Perfect Sessions collection a few weeks ago.  Sadly, it is very difficult to pick up this particular box set anymore unless you pay quite a bit of money to buy someone's used copy.  I say, collect all the Bandai DVD's and avoid the Hong Kong rips which are very bad.

By far and away, my most favorite anime, for its really solid commitment to never wasting a shot or an episode.  The series references SO many world pop culture ideas, films, music and stories that there are pages devoted to listing all the outside influences on this series.  Suffice to say, it would be silly to try and summarize it here  Go and watch the series or read many of the detailed reviews that come before mine.

The film is not as tightly done as the series however, which I was slightly disappointed with.  It's beatiful, and engaging.  But it also dragged, and I felt that the movie was long, wherein I can't believe it when an episode is over.  An opinion true...but one that doesn't detract from my recommendation of the last piece of the perfect session boxset (the original set replaced the spot for the movie dvd with the first OST...which is still excellent).",1095638400,,1225,4.527272727272727
1647665,5,B00005QCW4,"I am not a huge anime fan.  Some of it is good but most of it gets bogged down in childish humor and silliness while trying to present itself seriously.

However, Cowboy Bebop is not merely anime.  The characters and style of the series set it apart.  More adult and more mature in its treatment of its characters, it presents an interesting viewing experience.  They say in good fiction that a story should be character driven versus event driven.  Cowboy Bebop creates diverse characters with their own histories and it is the juxtaposition of these diverse characters that provides the story with color and depth.

Of course the animation is excellent and the integration of CGI is smooth and largely transparent to the viewer.

The series takes place in the future where n'er-do-well bounty hunters (cowboys) Spike and Jet hunt down villains from the Cowboy Bebop (Jet's ship).  Throughout the story more characters are introduced: a Corgy named Ein; a tedious, gambling addict femme fatale (Faye); an androgynous computer genius (Crazy Ed... a girl); not to mention notable villains, a lost love, and arch nemesis.

The action is smooth (no blurry bizarre battle scenes or mysterious flashing energy blasts) the stories are fun and somewhat somber at times, but never silly.",1094601600,,1279,5.018957345971564
1647666,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop is one of the most popular anime series on the planet, generating huge sales on both sides of the Pacific.  The twenty-six episode series has been airing on Cartoon Network for years, and yet every time they try to pull it off the air there is such an uproar from fans that it invariably reappears on the lineup.  Its a sensation in a way few other animes are.

Upon watching the series, the reasons for all the buzz become abundantly clear.  No other anime series combines such high production values with such a unique sense of style and such a memorable cast of characters.  Not only that, but it actually challenges to audience to think and pushes emotional buttons most action animes don't dare touch.

The premise of the show is simple.  In the future, bounty hunters known as cowboys fly around the solar system catching bounty heads for the government.  The show focuses on the crew of the spaceship ""Bebop,"" led by Spike Speigel and Jet Black.  Also on board are sexpot troublemaker Faye Valentine, computer hacker Ed, and that lovable Welsh Corgie Ein.  The series chronicles their adventures through space while effortlessly switching genres and providing strong standalone tales which help paint a larger picture.

Since the show is episodic (a rarity in anime), the reoccuring cast of characters is what grounds the show.  The crew of the Bebop are all well developed, fully convincing people with past secrets, present flaws, and future desires.  The element that connects each individual episode is how they all contribute to developing this cast of misfits, slowly revealing information until the end of the series leaves us with four fully realized characters.

Being the star, Spike naturally gets the most developement, and its the story of his past developed over five scattered episodes that form the main thrust of Bebop's narrative.  These episodes deal with Spike's history as a member of the Red Dragon crime syndicate and his dubious relationships with a man named Vicious and a mysterious blonde called Julia.  These episodes prove the be the series' best written and executed, with ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" (which introduces Vicious) being the standout.  That episode's climatic shootout in an abandoned cathedral is one of the most beautifully executed set pieces I've ever seen animated, perfectly combining music, visual flair, and emotion into one amazing sequence.

Of course, Faye, Jet, and Ed all get episodes that focus on their pasts too.  And all the while they pursue bounty heads in adventures the touch upon just about every genre imaginable.  For instance, the episode ""Pierrotte le Fou"" is a visceral thriller, while two episodes later is the gut-bustingly funny spaghetti western ""Cowboy Funk.""  Whatever genre its in, every episode sports smart, well-written scripts with plenty of clever dialogue.  Each episode is also animated with a cineamatic flair that helps to establish Bebop's utterly unique style.

And then there's that glorious, glorious Yoko Kanno score.  The lady really outdid herself this time, switching genres as often as the episodes do without missing a beat.  The score is so good I went through the trouble of importing one of the soundtrack CDs (there are at least three) before they became domestically available.  As with all her work, Kanno's score manages to perfectly underscore the dramatic action while remaining highly enjoyable on its own.

Cowboy Bebop is a must have for anyone even casually interested in anime.  The show's combination of action, character drama, and overwhelming style is unmatched.  The smartly written episodes will still entertain after multiple viewings.  And Bebop has one of the very best dub casts ever recorded.  Buy this show now.  You won't be disappointed.",1092009600,3,3779,5.1042345276872965
1647667,5,B00005QCW4,"All 26 episodes of Cowboy Bebop represent some of the best of what the anime medium has to offer. Brilliant scripts, voice acting (and for once the U.S. doesn't get shortchanged), animation quality, character designs, storylines, action scenes, environments, soundtrack (!!!!) etc. etc.... this has it all, folks.

 In my mind director Shinichir Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto and the studios of Bandai have created a better Tarantino feature than Tarantino himself--Cowboy Bebop's got all the seamless cool, clever pop culture references, intense action scenes, funny whip-smart dialogue, and superb pacing without indulging in the above director's popcorn nihilism and somewhat repulsive violence/sex fetishes. Unlike, say, Pulp Fiction, you actually develop an attachment to Cowboy Bebop's quirky, flawed, and engaging characters with equal parts humor and pathos. Main character Spike Spiegal is fascinating as a down-on-his-luck bounty hunter with a dark past he'd rather forget. The supporting characters--Jet (grizzled, world-weary former police officer turned bounty hunter), Faye (femme fatale with even worse luck than Spike and a back story to match), and Ed (bizarre, idosyncratic, somewhat androgynous child prodigy)--are all archetypes, but they're all deep, intriguing and fully fleshed-out roles that remain interesting throughout the series. Even most of the villians are characters unto themselves, with real motivations for their actions. Although the dark figure of Vicious is an obvious example of this, I must also mention the antagonists from episodes 6 and 20 (""Sympathy For The Devil"" and ""Pierrot Le Fou,"" respectively). Both extremely haunting characters--watch it and you will understand. Even Ein, the crew's genetically altered Welsh Corgi, has a back story.

 Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi set in a dystopic future, but the setting of the series does not align to the usual, plastic ""this-is-the-future"" potrayals of most sci-fi. The environment here feels lived-in and realistic, with a clever blend of new and old. You've got your typical jump gates, spaceships, colonies orbiting planets, terraforming, and other sorts of ""future"" technology; but on the other hand, people still carry pistols with ordinary bullets, smoke cigarettes, walk around in 20th-century garb, drive cars that don't fly (most of the time), and all the multicultural trappings and traditions are still intact. This gives the series a gritty Western feel (rivalled only by the excellent Trigun, another anime you should be watching). Especially endearing is the fact that Spike and Jet spend most of their time cruising the solar system in the future equivalent of an old fishing boat. While it's not 100% accurate when it comes to physics and science, it's still a very compelling look at the future. It's all the little touches and details that make the difference.

 One of the best things about Cowboy Bebop is that while it has an overlying story, it is also episodic in nature. Most of the episodes are self-contained and can be watched individually without missing too much (there are a few exceptions, mainly episodes 5, 12, 13, 25 and 26, which I won't spoil). That makes this series even more accessible to the newcomer.

 Finally, Yoko Kanno's soundtrack...*jaw drops*. It's brilliant, a hodgepodge of jazz (the swinging, sexy opening theme of ""Tank!"" alone made me go seek out the soundtrack), blues, techno, funk, world music, rock 'n' roll and so on. Yoko Kanno is a widely respected composer for a reason, and this may be her finest work.

 Suffice to say, if your only exposure to anime is the sterilized American TV versions of Dragonball Z and Pokemon, treat yourself to your first REAL anime. And it's not just for fans of the medium either. Anybody who can appreciate brilliant writing, gorgeous visuals, multifaceted characters, great action scenes, unique atmosphere, and killer music will find tons to enjoy in Cowboy Bebop. This is a must-buy.",1090972800,,3975,5.3456
1647668,4,B00005QCW4,"Although it may be unAmerican, and surely it's a rip-off from potential money going to Bandai, (...)I was really worried about what I'd be receiving. The truth is, the package was awesome- the DVD quality if FANTASTIC (there's a little digital blurring during a ship-flight scene), and the dub is exactly the original American dub seen on Adult Swim (the English subtitles disagree somewhat). There are even a few special features, including music videos and such- nothing important really. I'm a little hesitant, as some may have had different experiences... I'll say that the copy I got is 3-CD, from Singapore, in a brown/gray cardboard-flip case that has Spike in a subway or something, standing next to a blonde woman. The inside has a bit of art as well. It's not the cover, with the black on top and bottom and all the characters, shown on Amazon.
Your experience my differ, and granted, this set isn't exactly perfect, with a little digital blurring. But for 30 dollars, my experience, at least, was an awesome deal.",1087603200,10,1024,4.857142857142857
1647669,5,B00005QCW4,"This is the best anime series I've ever seen and I've seen alot of them including movies.  When it comes to anime there is a few names people know.  Akira, Macross, Ghost In The Shell, Trigun, Ninja Scroll.  Cowboy Bebop is right up there.  I love this anime because it is real and it doesn't pull any punches.  It is classic yet new age.  It's a sci-fi space thing yet it's like a western yet like an epic.  It is everything that is good.  I own the Limited Edition Box and the 3 disc Hong Kong import.  The story is based on 5 characters who all have their own interesting backgrounds and somehow life as it happens has these five come together.  Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are bounty hunters using a commercial fishing ship(spaceship this is the future) as their mode of transportation.  In this bounty hunting is very lucritive as there is even a tv show that updates them on new bounties.  Along the way they meet three other characters that join the crew at Spike's displeasure and Jet's indifference.  There is far too much for me write of in the epic of anime greatness.  I really felt like I knew and shared in their journey by the end.  All this and probably one of the best soundtracks ever produced.  Eclectic is the word...it is a jazzy, blues inspired rock techno organism of music that plays well with the story.  All I say is rent, buy or borrow and watch this is you are an anime fan and you have not yet, for some God awful reason, seen this.  Now the nice collection you see with the entire series is not the Limited 7 disc set which includes the soundtrack...if you find the big box it will be at least $200 dollars but probably more than that as it is a limited numbered to 15,000.  The 3 disc collection containing all 26 episodes is the import Hong Kong version which can be played here.  This is usually around $30 dollars or so.  It has great video and sound quality and doesn't suck compared to the U.S. releases as some would say.  Either way it is a great series and all anime fans should have this one.",1087603200,3,2032,4.3201058201058204

Each episode develops a particular character and by the finale (episodes 25-26) you feel like you know them personally. You feel for them. May I add that the music score for Cowboy Bebop is incredible for an Anime. This is, by far, more than just Anime; it's something beyond words. You are going to want to watch this over and over again.",1087171200,,560,4.666666666666667
1647671,5,B00005QCW4,"First I would like to say that yes, you can be disappointed by Cowboy Bebop, if you've been inundated with everyone telling you that nothing compares to it.  It's not perfect.  You can cut it apart, and criticize the parts.  But I for one do feel that, as a total package, Cowboy Bebop is the best anime short series ever produced.  If you're looking for pure violence, it's not for you.  If you don't like jazz, it's not for you.  If you're looking for hyper-accuracy with physics and mechanics, it's not for you (although they do a half-way decent job).  But if you're looking for deep characters, good animation for a series, and want to be sucked into another world for 30 minutes at a time, Cowboy Bebop is definitely for you.  Again, it's the best, well-rounded series I have seen.
The strength of Cowboy Bebop comes in its character development, editing, and soundtrack.  The characters are as evolved and deep as you can get in a short series that doesn't sacrifice other aspects of the storytelling.  I felt pretty attached to all of the characters by the end (even Ein, although granted I own a Pembroke Welsh Corgi...which in fact was one of the reasons I first starting watching Cowboy Bebop!).  A mark of a good series, I feel, is the emotional investment you make...I really didn't want the series to end, and I feel that's mainly due to the characters and the emotional reaction you get from them.  The pace of each session/episode is wonderful.  The editors paid a great deal of attention to the interplay of action sequences and story-developing sequences, development of suspense, and integration of humor and lighter parts.  I never really felt bored or uninterested at any time through all the sessions.  As with most short series, there are a few reoccuring themes and storylines throughout the length of the show.  Cowboy Bebop does a great job of building that story gradually, until things come to a head at the end.  As for the music...like I said, if you don't like jazz, perhaps this isn't for you.  As a fan, I loved the use of fusion and classic jazz throughout the series.  It went well with the milieu...an electic blend of future and past.  The high energy numbers highlighted the action, whereas the slower ballads accentuated the emotions of the different scenes.  Excellent use of music...I've yet to come across another anime series (or mainstream movie or tv show!) that has so rich and unique a soundtrack.  Yoko Kanno has penned a number of anime soundtracks, but Cowboy Bebop is by far her best.
So, bottomline is that Cowboy Bebop is worth getting.  At the risk of mentioning cost...well frankly if any series is worth the $150+ price tag, Cowboy Bebop is it.",1086048000,3,2700,4.71002132196162
1647672,5,B00005QCW4,"This is a very interesting series. What strikes me most is the supranational atmosphere that prevails in the whole series. The various cityscapes that appear in the series are often a melange of North America, Asia, and Middle East. This statelessness applies to the main characters as well. They all bear western-sounding names - Spike, Jet, Fay, Ed, etc. - but look decidedly Asian to me. They are just as rootless as they are stateless as they all have a past that they struggle to come to terms with. They piece together the shattered fragments of their less-than-savory past as they wander around from one planet to another. All this is presumably a reflection of the so-called globalism that now seems to be eveloping the world.
 If there are any villains in this series, they are all depicted as victims of circumstances, imparting a sense of sadness and soulfulness to the proceedings. All in all, this is a very good series and also serves as a reminder that the consciousness of the masses has gone well beyond national boundaries in the realm of popular culture while our leaders are busy exciting people's patriotic feelings on both sides of the Pacific.",1082678400,3,1166,4.83

The video quality is horrible and unless you just want a copy of the series and don't mind the poor quality, I really wouldn't reccomend it.

1647681,4,B00005QCW4,"I bought the 3-disc ""import"" (wink-wink) from one of Amazon's Z-shop sellers. I got it in relatively short time in good condition.

As far as a value goes, the set is a very solid one. After shipping, the total was $27.50. That's about $1 per episode - much better than most complete anime series (outlaw star, for instance, came to about $95 for the 3 2-disc sets.)

The episodes are arranged in a very easy to view format - you can just watch the whole thing in one sitting, or you can select episode beginnings from the main menu. The chapter breaks are placed exactly where they should be.

The sound is dolby stereo. It won't knock your socks off, but it is acceptable for a television release like CB.

My only issue with quality is the video - on my HDTV, it is very easy to see digital artifacts on very high-action scenes - such as the ship flying through hyperspace - quite pixellated. But it's to be expected, since they've basically crammed 9 episodes onto each disc. On a regular television, the effect will probably be diminished somewhat.

In the end, I'm glad I purchased this set instead of getting the slightly higher quality US discs - for 27 bucks I got the whole series - while one of the US ""session"" discs will run you about the same price. It really shows you how companies like Bandai and ADV (producers of the execrable Robotech sets) are out to screw the US consumer - dribbling out incomplete and overpriced releases instead of giving us a good deal on the whole thing.

1647694,5,B00005QCW4,"An interesting twist on traditional anime, Cowboy Bebop is at once fresh, original, and wildly entertaining. It injects new life into a classic genre.
I first discovered this series on Cartoon Network's adult swim late-night block, and quickly began to really like it. The fight scenes are beautifully animated, the 26 episodes (each of which stands on its own) are well written and perfectly paced.
Speaking of which, the episode structure is very unlike most anime, where you have to see every episode or you don't understand it at all. The episodes in Bebop are all tied together with a common theme: Spike Spiegel and company travel throughout space in the near future, looking for bounty, their own backstories unraveling bit by bit. This formula works very well.
Bebop also conveys an atmosphere that sometimes changes but is always well done with each episode. It is, for the most part, either gritty and violent (Episode 5: Ballad of Fallen Angels) or goofy and sometimes laugh out loud funny (Episode 12: Toys in the Attic). Director Watanabe is great at really drawing the viewer in so that often you forget about what else is happening around you.
Bebop is not without flaws, however. Sometimes the episodes seem to have filler or are WAY too slow paced. This is mainly only a problem with Episode 20: Boogie Woogie Feng Shui. Half the episode is almost all dialogue, with hardly any real movement. It just doesn't feel like the rest of the series.
That one very small shortcoming aside, however, Bebop is amazing, and well worth it whether you enjoy anime or not. This is something anyone can appreciate.",1077148800,,1616,4.858695652173913

This means that you will not receive the OST disc, only the episodes and there are no commentaries / art galleries / character designs and the few ""extra's"" that are present are simply noise to us Gaijin, Ne?
These three disc sets are also MPEG 2 files, meaning that you can get them to play on your computer without a DVD reader/driver and although the discs [not the case] claims a letterbox format is available; I have yet to find out how to view anything but full screen.
All in all, still a good deal [sorta] compared to the seventy bucks or so that the REAL Perfect Session disc set [issued by Pioneer and still to be found in most larger anime/game stores] will cost you PROVIDED that all you seek is the episodes, which are well transfered and adequately dubbed on this three disc JP import; it's quite obviously NOT a boot.
Should you desire [english] commentaries, art galleries, character designs, etc. [like found on the very excellent movie disc - hint hint] then you should read the descriptions [3 does not equal 7] or e-mail the seller to make sure you are getting the real seven disc item.
The three disc sets are somehow related to Manga DVD, Inc. but you have to look REAL close to find their logo on the case and their usual plethora of previews is absent.

1647699,5,B00005QCW4,"If you're going to buy one anime boxed set in your lifetime, this would be the one I'd recommend. Cowboy Bebop is snazzy and sweet! The series follows the exploits of the crew of the Bebop -- Jet Black,(a former police officer), Spike Spiegal (a former member of a mob syndicate), Faye Valentine (a compulsive gambler) Ed the computer hacking child genius, and Ein, a welsh corgie -- and their quest for money as bounty hunters. Each episode contains a different criminal that the team conspires to catch, usually with amusing results... and less money than they had hoped for. However, a larger story arc is contained on the discs, with each characters' pasts trying to catch up with them.
Cowboy Bebop will make you laugh, with it's improbable schemes and wacky characters, but it will also make you cry (especially if you're a sentimental mush-head like me... *sniffle*) Not a single person that I've shown this series to has come away not liking it.

Of course Cowboy Bebop is great, and it ranks number one on my list of all time favourites, however, the advertisement on this site is misleading.
You will only get the 7 disc version if you order from a manufacturer and pay the full price. Buying one from the ""Used & New"" section will get you only the three disc version.
However, there is no way of knowing this before you order, and that's why some people (like me) feel cheated.
There's no note that says that the one you are buying is the three disc set, and I think that's pretty lousy because that way people get their hopes up for nothing. Not everyone can afford $190 for a box set of anime, especially with the economy gone under here in California.
If you're on a budget and you want to see a quality anime without a whole lot of extras, simply get one of the Used & New. If you have money to spend on hobbies like this, you should definately buy one from the manufacturer.",1073692800,30,1062,4.288557213930348

1647703,4,B00005QCW4,"I had ordered the Cowboy Bebop Complete Sessions from Amazon a few weeks ago but got a message saying that their inventory indicated that the item was already out of stock. So, that sucks. I searched Amazon Marketplace and bought the ""Perfect Sessions,"" a limited edition DVD Box Set of the complete series. I really should have realized that the offer was for a bootleg copy (the very cheap price should have been a dead giveaway) but I ordered it not thinking it through. Anyway, it advertised as three discs (the official one is six), DVD player Region-free (a clear sign that it's bootleg), english and chinese subtitles (it is rare to find a DVD with chinese subs), and finally, only...dollars (the official one costs around $...retail, however Amazon had it as a special for $...). Anyway, i've been anxiously anticipating a cheap, shoddy, set of discs arriving in a ""box set"" with the words Cowboy Bebop scribbled on. Gawd, i never expected this. this is one of the best bootlegs i have ever seen. The look of the box and the discs are not the only great things; the content is actually pretty damn clear. I swear you cannot tell the difference between the this and the real DVD's (I bought the official DVD's individually from a different site that had it in stock). The sound is a bit low but the picture quality is more than acceptable. The sound is in stereo so you hear everything the way it's supposed to be. The DVD menus can't seem anymore authentic and even the extras are included (sans subtitles though, which reminded me that this was not an official copy). There are only three discs but the quality is not half bad.
Oh and the real Bebop DVD's are fantastic. A must have for everyone!
I advise that you buy the OFFICIAL product individually (as that is what the Complete Sessions is, anyway) if you really want the good quality DVD set. But if you can't shell out more than...dollars, perhaps you can try purchasing the Hong Kong bootleg. Its quality is great. Know that I will be proudly putting this HK copy on my shelf right next to the official DVD set.",1066089600,,2078,4.57372654155496

On The Perfect Sessions (Limited Edition Complete Series Boxed Set) the video looks like it was transfered from VHS(mucho video artifacts and fuzzy picture) and the sound is Pro-Logic(only the menu is in Dolby Digital not the program).

But a couple years ago I saw ""Ballad of Falling Angels"" for the first time and have been a fan of the series every since. The character development, music, plot, just the feel of it is superb. The world that's been created for bebop will draw you in slowly until you feel as if your apart of this future. Cowboy Bebop seems to have connected strongly with american audiences, and the appeal is international. There are no lame jokes that only japanese audiences will get a laugh out of, the humor is genuine and the action scenes are amazing.
I just can't say enough about how good this show is. Don't ignore it just because it's drawn, I recommend this show to any fan of action shows and hopefully you don't mind that it's animated. Anime fans and non anime fans will fall in love with Cowboy Bebop. I did.

BAD IDEA! In the states the show was split over 6 discs. When all episodes are crammed on discs, you lose video quality, and the quality on these DVDs was and is terrible. There is a lot of square pixels whenever there is action so it is kind of hard to see some things. When you have to cram everything on there the quality suffers. But surprisingly the sound quality is very nice, even though it is in 2.0 Surround. I just wish that I could have had the series split over 6 discs with at least 4-6 episodes each disc and the video quality upped a little but that set is out of print and now you have to buy each disc individually in session sets or buy it in a pack... I wanted to save money so I took the easy way out. I love Bebop and I think the show's overall quality is lost when the episodes were crammed. Oh well, at least I have the mangas and the movie!

I had only seen scattered episodes here and there and wanted to see them all. A friend of mine got the first 3 DVDs and let me watch them. The next day, I went out and bought the whole set for myself. The series is awesome, the depth in the characters is amazing. Everything is drawn with detail and the action scenes are insane. The sheer amount of cool stuff that happens coupled with one of the most beastly soundtracks ever adapted into anime makes this series better than any other.

My thoughts: Well worth buying. Ed rules. Spike is one of (if not the) coolest characters in anime, I love the way he dodges punches like he's dancing. The music is some of the best in anime, blues-jazz that seems like it shouldn't fit so well but it does. One of the best opening and closing sequences I've seen.

Also while you're at it, get Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Big O too. Semper Fi!",1036108800,,637,4.5964912280701755
1647753,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop is a truely wonderful anime. I am not exactly proud to say that my first incounter with the show was on cartoon network, but since then I have done much more with it. I went ahead and watched the whole series, and then I saw it in Japanese. I am happy to say that the dubbing for Cowboy Bebop was surprisingly well done and accurate. Even the voice acters seemed to be well trained. The storyline of the series is incredibly complex. It developes each charecter into these poor, twisted souls that have led such sad and unfortunate lives. A person can not help but to get emotionally involved with each of them and think of them as existing persons. Each episode manages to be amazingly deep and insightful. It makes a person think differently about the many aspects of life; such as God, death, fear, drugs, love, honor, exetra. The series is very different from other anime shows that you might see. The soundtrack to Cowboy Bebop alone, is remarkably unique. The music consitsts of light jazz and blues musics, and it adds beautifuly to the mood of the situations. I have also seen the Cowboy Bebop movie, ""Knockin on Heaven's Door"". Though I have only seen it in Japanese, I highly recomend it to anyone who has ever watched an episode of the series. Or to anyone at all for that matter.",1035763200,,1304,4.529661016949152
1647754,5,B00005QCW4,"2071 A.D.  Mankind has been flung from Earth into the rest of the Sol System because of a man-made accident years ago.  Life goes on, and so does the rest of mankind.  Criminals are rampant, and so are new adventures, which means Spike and the rest of the crew of the Bebop can make a few woolongs and have some fun.
Spike Spiegel is the lead male character in this series.  Although he wears the look of a slacker about him, this bounty hunter is anything but.  Skilled in hand-to-hand and ranged combat, he is an ex-member of the Red Dragons syndicate, but he ""died"" in that life 3 years ago.  His partner, Jet Black, and him are the original crew members of the Bebop, a converted fishing ship now meant for space travel.  He'll often use his smaller ship, the Swordfish II, to get him into and out of any trouble that arises.
Faye Valentine is the lead female character(one of the few females throughout the series) who originally came onto the Bebop in handcuffs (twice, actually).  However, she soon became an adopted crew member and fellow bounty hunter, although she doesn't work with Spike or Jet (she'll split the reward most of the time).  She's very similar to Spike in some aspects, but this only leads drives both of them towards being more competitive with one another.  She's cool, level-headed, confident, and isn't the kind of woman to mess around with.  She is definitely sexy, but her womanly charms work on every other guy in the series but Spike and Jet.  She'll often backup Spike on jobs using her personal ship, the Redtail, which she uses to blow away most of the trouble that comes along.
Jet Black is a former member of ISSP (InterStellar Space Police) stationed on Ganymede, but after an accident which made him lose his left arm, he retired and became partners with Spike aboard the Bebop.  He owns the Bebop as well as his own smaller ship, the Hammerhead, which he'll pilot usually to save Spike and their bounty.  He's not usually found on the frontline, but rather, he provides significant backup support for Spike while they're searching for their target.  He's the most mature crew member, and he isn't the type to lose his cool easily.
Ed's real name is Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th, although he's commonly refered to as Ed or ""Radical Edward"" (his hacker alias).  Ed, however, is an 13 year old female, and although she may talk a lot of gibberish and act goofy, DO NOT let this confuse you.  Ed is a child prodigy and a renouned computer hacker, and while she may act weird most of the time, she is incredibly intelligent and probably knows more about what is going on than the rest of the crew put together.
Ein is a Welsh Corgi dog, and as a result of multiple experiments performed on him, he's now a data dog.  In essence, Ein is smarter than the average dog, as well as a few people found in the series.  When Ed joins the crew, both girl and dog become fast friends, and they're often found together both on and off the Bebop.  Most of the time, he can be found sleeping, eating, or being harassed by Faye.
What makes Cowboy Bebop so great is a combination of things.  First of all, unlike most series, Cowboy Bebop has no predestination.  By what I mean is that there is no great treasure they're all trying to find, there is no great goal or beautiful man/woman they're trying to rescue.  Each episode is a telling of a crew member's adventure, and they all have their own different feel.  From somber (Speak Like A Child) to sadistic (Pierrot La Fou) to action-packed (Gateway Shuffle) to comedic (Mushroom Samba), this series has a different feel for each episode, which will satisfy any type of person.
In addition, I'm not 100% positive about this, but I believe that none of the music tracks (with exception for the opening and closing tracks) are ever repeated throughout the entire series.  What I mean is that the song Ballad of a Fallen Angel is never played outside of the cathedral scene in the episode ""Ballad of Fallen Angels.""  This means that there is no repetition of the same old boring song for whenever some villian comes on screen, and they don't try to use one different song for multiple scenes where that song may not even have the right feel for that scene.  If a music track is played for a scene, its unique for only that particular scene, and thats it.
I haven't seen Trigun yet, so any of those Vash fans out there can hush for now as I say that Cowboy Bebop is #1 anime series.  Why is that?  The plot? Quite good.  The music? Top notch.  The characters? Splendid.  The series? Flawless.
If you haven't yet, go check out Cowboy Bebop.  Trust me, if you spend some cash and buy the DVDs, you will not be disappointed at all, and if there was a 2nd season, you'd probably buy that soon afterwards.  :)",1035590400,2,4782,4.502896871378911

The animation is superbly drawn, mixed with some cool CG effects. Equally as good is the musical score. There's an incredible range of music, all of which suits each scenario perfectly, from jazz to heavy metal to swing numbers. The simple (for an anime), but powerful plot cautiously advances through its 26 episodes.  Each character has secrets that they are trying to conquer and pasts that are catching up with them.

1647760,4,B00005QCW4,"I first started watching this series about half a year ago. At the time, I hated all Japanese cartoons I'd seen except Evangelion, which I consider the greatest work of fiction ever created in human history. I'd also seen a Cowboy Bebop music video that I thought was cool, as it was about this red-haired girl named Edward who was absolutely and hilariously insane. When a person I knew in my Engineering class overheard me talking with a friend about Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Bebop video, he told me that Cowboy Bebop was really good and that I should watch it. He was able to provide me with all 26 episodes on CDs. I copied them onto my laptop, and forced myself to watch the first 6 episodes, none of which had Edward. I thought it was some of the worst crap I'd ever seen, with nothing but shallow plots and senseless violence. Like Pokemon with drugs and blood. It was about two bounty hunters who basically revolved their lives around hunting down and killing people they didn't know - not exactly the kinds of characters you sympathize with much. I didn't really feel compelled to watch the rest, whereas Evangelion had me hook, line, and sinker after the first 6 episodes. Still, after a few days, I pressed on, mostly because I wanted to see more of Edward. I endured the grueling torture of all the episodes up through 14, and although I loved all of Edward's bizarre lines and antics, my opinions of the overall plot hadn't changed, and I stopped again. It was a while before I resumed my viewing, and I was only slightly impressed by the next few episodes. At some point, though, the episodes started to actually hold my attention. Some of them had the same senseless plots, but very poetic endings that made them worth watching (like the Chess one); other episodes simply blew me away with their raw emotion (like the ones that focus on Faye's past). Every few weeks, I would watch 3 or 4 more episodes and then stop again. Although many of them were the same old garbage, some of them were good enough to make me watch this show up to its truly awesome finale. I actually just finished watching the series yesterday afternoon - six months after I started! I will never forget Spike's line ""I'm not going there to die. I'm going there to find out whether or not I'm truly alive,"" nor will I forget the many highly explosive ""presents"" he tossed around that day :)
Overall, I think this show has enough good episodes to make up for its many bad ones, and I will spare the series from being deleted off my hard drive. It's not Evangelion, to be sure, nor is it as good as some American cartoons like Exo Squad and Gargoyles. But it's definitely worth watching at least once, if you can tolerate its low points, and I'm sorry that I didn't get through it sooner.
My deepest thanks go to Edward - if not for you, I would not have kept watching this show.
And in case you're wondering... the bounty hunters never actually stop hunting people, they just become likeable because they act really nice to the people they're not trying to kill.",1031702400,3,3056,4.498201438848921
1647761,5,B00005QCW4,"Oh yes, we've all heard of Cowboy Bebop. The wonderfully hip series. Ultra stylish with subtle hints of pop culture. The anime with a genre of its own. Why does Cowboy Bebop make every fan want to light a cigarette, form an oddball gang of bounty hunters, and join the Great Spirit? This is the reason...
Cliches and cliches. That's what anime is about. There are many genres, but sometimes we get tired of the conventional styles. We want to break free, form our own boundaries and lines. That's where Cowboy Bebop is different, but easy to relate to. From the first episode, our ears perk up. What is this sound? Jazz?! Yes my good sir, that is jazz. Good jazz. Jazz that makes you want to be cool like the characters that light the screen. Laidback Spike Spiegel is a cowboy, a bounty hunter, a guy that just doesn't care. With a mysterious past and a lean figure, he's partners with Jet Black, an ex-cop with an equally mysterious past. They're both free spirits, moving across the solar system thanks to the gateways. Cowboys move from town to town. Space cowboys move from planet to planet. Eventually they'll come across people you'd absolutely hate if you weren't human. First there's Faye Valentine, a woman with attitude; Ed the hacker, famous for her bouts of psychadelic babbles of nonsense; and Ein, a data dog that has an I.Q. that rivals most human beings. Chemistry is there as each character learns to confront their past and live their lives. Sure, the end is inevitable. But what Cowboy Bebop focuses on is their (mis)adventures and the fact that no matter what, their time together will affect them for a long time.
Jazz... jazz... I mentioned this topic already, remember? Kanno Yoko is a pure genius. She deserves something. I say praise. This woman created the music that Bebop couldn't live without. That is what Bebop is all about. The freeform of jazz, the lifestyle. How we all wish we could break free when all the boundaries are set.",1031443200,11,1962,4.673410404624278
1647762,4,B00005QCW4,"I have just recently bought this series as the first in my soon-to-be anime collection. I bought it mostly off the advise of a friend, and got quite lucky indeed. I just want to get straight right now that I loved this series to the very end and it was worth every penny. However, I have one criticism that you may want to heed.
 This series is short, as with many anime series, being made up of only twenty-six quick episodes. The way the story line unfolds does not quite fit this length, in my opinion. This is because each episode has its own story line (with a few exceptions) with its own beggining and resolution. With this ""one story at a time"" format, the underlying storylines of each character's pasts does not get enough screen-time. I believe this series should have been presented in a more solid manner, rather than being broke up. Or possibly it could have been a longer series. One way or another, presentation and length do not fit together all that well. This being said, the characters are believable and fun, the villian is simply awesome, the concept is great, the animation is up to par, the soundtrack is wonderful, and the ending is a shocker. If you are considering buying this series, and you are an anime fan, please do so. You will not be dissapointed.",1030838400,2,1281,4.521551724137931
1647763,4,B00005QCW4,"This anime could have been the greatest series ever if they stuck to the plot, but they had to go off and make filler episodes which I think ruined the feel of the story.

But the last couple episode are the stuff of legends when Spike has his final showdown with Viscious.

1647767,5,B00005QCW4,"A.k.a. ""the show with the stupid name."" Or that's what many people (including me) say when they first hear about it. First of all, you know the saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover""? Well, this is a perfect example.
I'm not going tell you that it's the best anime ever and that you should go watch it asap! At least, that's not all I'm gonna say. ^^ I'm gonna lay out the facts for you and show you, as well as I can, why I think this anime series is worth taking up your time.
Cowboy Bebop is unlike any other anime. Why? Because everything about it: it's style, the high quality animation, and the background music is unique. The music is mostly composed of jazz and blues, which to me gives it a nice soothing feel to it. A friend of mine however believed that it was unnecessesary and there should've been dark ominous music instead. But I believe that the jazz music is part of what makes CB so unique using its own style. Not to say that the series is laid back; it's anything but calm! There's plenty of smooth action. The artwork is some of the best I've ever seen. A lot of anime series that I've seen are clean, pretty, scenes with cutesy, innocent girls running around in sailor uniforms and heroic boys with bishounen faces. Director Shinichir Watanabe deters from that completely. He portrays a futuristic world that's not too different from our own with the influence of popculture, ethnic groups, etc. To put things short, if New York were animated, it'd look something like this.
But of course, the characters are the main priority. To tell you the truth, there isn't much of a plot...because in my opinion there just isn't need for one! The series is about four bounty hunters: Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed. A lot of the series is focused on them hunting heads for cash, but don't let that turn you off. The characters are interesting and very believable. Throughout the series they overcome obstacles in their own lives, often times on their own and feeling lost. Before you know it you begin to feel their anger, their sorrow, their joy, their pain. And by the time the series is over, you can't help but want to see more so you can see where life will take them next.
Evangelion may be ""the best anime ever"" but Cowboy Bebop is definitely something to see.",1029110400,3,2276,4.460431654676259

1647770,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop, the best anime series of all time.  The art is beautiful and has its own style.  The music is full of emotion and blues.  The character design is excellent.  The action scenes are unbelieveable.
This series is not for children, but for anyone who likes anime and not just cute little sailor moon anime.  This isn't a very happy series, but it is full of emotion and it will move you emotionally.  This series is separated from other anime because of the characters.  These are not wonderful heroic people trying to help save the world, these are bold and brave and dangerous people searching drifting through life without fear, and they challenge death many times which makes for some great action and drama.
Even if the main characters aren't completely heroic, you will feel for them and like them immensly for their personalities and bravery.  The characters are so unique from other series that they seem more like real people than just animated.  You will be filled with emotion in certain parts of the series such as deaths of characters, which is helped by the wonderful music.

Although this is a very serious series about bounty hunters and a dangerous lifestyle, it is played off by plenty of humor.  You will laugh in about every episode.  This is not that corny anime humor in dragon ball or those series for little kids, but this is some good stuff.  For instance in one episode everyone is eating mushrooms because there is nothing else to eat and they have no idea what is going on.

not for the dragonballz crowd. :) closer to the akira or lain fans, but less science fiction involved. it just happens to take place in the future. *grin*

Considered one of the best animated series of all time, Cowboy Bebop told the story of 4 down on their luck bounty hunters who just can't seem to get a break.  While the continuing story focuses around Spike Spiegal and his rivalry with Vicious, most episodes are self-contained short storys, straight out of the detective novels.  Also, Yoko Kano's band, the Seatbelts, play the unique and awesome jazz and blues style music known as bebop for the background, giving the series an unusual feel, and in this case, that's a good thing.

I was flipping channels between bad SNL sketches and commercials when I came to Cartoon Network. What I saw was unlike any  other thing that I had seen before. I was hooked from my first glance, and for the first two minutes of it I did not blink. At 11:45, a commercial came on and I waited in anticipation to discover the title of a work so great. When the commercial ended, I heard from the TV, ""Cowboy Bebop now continues."" It was right then that I realized that Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime that I have ever seen. At the time, I was watching Session 4, but the next Saturday at 11:30, I saw possibly the best episode ever; Session 5: Ballad of Fallen Angels. It was this Cowboy Bebop episode that forced me to get more in touch with the phenomenon that I saw. Ever since, I have watched Adult Swim every week, and with every episode of Cowboy Bebop, I learn to love it more and more.

1647774,5,B00005QCW4,"You step into a bar, sit on a stool, take a wiff of the cigarette laiden air and listen as a woman croons the sorrows of hard livin'.  This is, in essence, the nature of Cowboy Bebop.
  Cowboy Bebop is likened to a flower in terms of story, each episode is self contained, (with the exeception of Jupiter Jazz and The Real Folk Blues) but with the extraordinary grace of words and cinematography with each episode the flower blooms a little more until the blazing conclusion in which it blooms only to wilt seconds later.
  The basic premise in this story is rather simple - take a Bruce Lee lovin' bounty hunter with a mysterious past, a responsible friend that gets the party out of trouble, a beautiful woman with an equally egotistical attitude, and genius hacker and mutt and put them together and see what chaos ensues.
  However, where other shows have failed, Bebop succeeds with cleverly written scripts (VHS is an 'ancient artifact') well paced subplots, and well developed characters.  We leave the series with a bittersweet taste in our mouth, but not angry or confused because there were unanswered questions.
  The soundtrack deserves a special note as well.  Bebop mixes Jazz, Funk, and Blues to produce a memorable score that you can't get out of your head.  Yoko Kanno and her band, The Seatbelts, produce some of the finest quality of Jazz and Blues I've heard recently.  From the ethireal Green Bird heard in episode five, Ballad of the Fallen Angels, to the funky, offbeat opening theme Tank!, Cowboy Bebop uses music to enhance, not ruin, the mood.
  Voice acting on both sides are delivered extremely well, which only hightens my praise for Bandai's treatement of this series.  Upon switching from dub to sub, viewers may find Faye's voice a little too high, Jet's a little rough, and Spike's a little off.  This shows how exceptional the dub is, for very few can saw that the dub is comparable to the sub in many series.
  You leave this series with a nod, a glance of understanding, because that's how Cowboy Bebop is.  No long goodbyes, no extended melodramatic moments, just life and its trials.  You either overcome them or fail; there is no middle option.",1024963200,2,2183,4.722222222222222
1647775,4,B00005QCW4,"I can't say enough good things about CB! For anime fans who might not have seen it, one sentence.  The absolute best adult oriented anime series ever.  In fact it is the very opitimy of an adult anime show.  Very smart, funny, thrilling, and engrossing.  Trust me, by the end of the series you will have a definet attatchment to the four main characters.  They are all well developed and interesting.  Most of the episodes in the series are more or less self contained, but in the end they all go to gether.  Unlike many anime series, if you were to miss an ep, more likely than not you would not be totaly lost when you saw the next one.  The visuals and audio in this dvd are phenomenal.  The picture is crisp and beautifull, and the sound comes crystal clear, so you can truely enjoy the amazing jazz filled soundtrack to the series.  The American voice actors are also some of the best I have ever heard, and do a great job when compared to the japanese VA's.  If you haven't seen CB, you must check it out.  I garuntee that once you have seen an ep or two you will start scowering the world for this dvd collection.
Now the bad news.  The price for this set is in my humble opinion, the worst thing I have every scene.  It is simply a travisty.  If you think you can find this for a better price on ebay your wrong.  Bandai should be ashamed of themselves for this.  The only alternatives to buying this costly box are to by the single dvd's but that will run you a lot as well.  I suggest you do what I did. I bought mine from an import website.  For a cool $... american I got a Hong Kong import version that had all the episodes in both english dub and original japanese, as well as most of the extras that this set includes.  Of course if you must have all the extra's you can stil buy this, but trust me why pay over $...

1647779,5,B00005QCW4,"The Modern Anime classic, Cowboy Bebop is out in boxset form and now is very rare.
You do not know what you are missing. Cowboy bebop is what one would call modern excellence. It fallows the lives of five not so heroic heros, Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein, as they try to pass their lives as bounty hunters in the 2070s.
Cowboy Bebop has extremely excellent music from the famious composer, Yoko Kanno, and animation as well as a highly enjoyable shell plot for the first time views and reflected plots that tell the character's backstory, foreshadow the future, and critize real life.
Yes it does have a lot of hidden plot in it, because of it's outter plot most fans do not realize it and pass it off as a simple action series. However do not be fooled, as much fun as you have watching the action you will enjoy the reflected plot more.
This box set also comes with the first Original Sound track of Cowboy Bebop wich contains both Tank!, and Rain (as hear in the ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" eppisode). The sound track is excellent and highly acclaimed. Very great jazz music that will remind you of the the 30s and 40s (the 2040s). I suggest buying the other CDs: No Disk, Vitaminless, Blue, Remixes for Freelance, and Future Blues from the movie. Amazon sells them also, and they are worth the perchase of import.
(the cowboy BeBop movie is set to be released this fall, keep on the look out for Knockin' On Heaven's Door)
Cowboy Bebop is a value you cannot pass up. Don't miss out on this new aged Anime Master Piece, Buy this box set from Amazon.com NOW! You will never regret it (I know I didn't)",1021593600,,1602,4.41554054054054
1647780,5,B00005QCW4,"Not only do you get the entire series on DVD, but you also get the original soundtrack!  For a series like Cowboy Bebop, it most certainly got what it deserved.  Some people may not like this series, but the majority will tell you its a masterpiece.  Its about a space bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel and his journey through space to get away from his past only to find himself ending right back into the frey of it.  Without giving away too much, this show demonstrates various good genres into one, nearly-perfect series.  It has some sci-fi, western, romance, gun-slinger, comedy, violence, horror, conspiracy, cop, fiction...there's so much to this seris that its hard to explain it all in one review.  Basically, its one of the better animes.
There are 5 main characters to this show.  Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Ed, Faye Valentine, and Ein.
Spike Spiegel - basic bounty hunter with great tactics and resourcefulness.  Can get himself out of the stickiest situations with his superb fighting styles (both hand-to-hand and gun)
Jet Black - Aged ex-cop who now runs and owns the ship the Cowboy Bebop.  Lost an arm when he was younger and on the job, now is freelance and gets information from a friend still working for the force.
Ed - Little hacker girl that can hack into just about anything with a circuit mind.  Very very intelligent when it comes to computers...very whacky and crazy when it comes to real-life.  Comic relief.
Faye Valentine - The sexy, female support model that can hold her own in fighting or gun-slinging.  She is a con-artist without a past, as she cannot remember anything from her childhood to her teen years.  She now searches for her past and tries to make a few bucks on the side.
Ein - the small animal of the group.  Not really a bounty hunter, but really a special kind of dog.  Although what kind of ""special"" this is is never revealed, Ein does play some important roles from time to time.  Usually hangs out with Ed.
The cast is set, now for the content of the series.  As far as blood is concerned, it does show a few violent scenes.  From a man having his throat cut, to people being shot in the forehead, Cowboy Bebop really doesn't hold much back.  Don't get me wrong, there isn't any spilling of internal organs, its basically all outside wounds and such.  Ok, now for the strange part...for an anime such as this, its bizarre that they don't show fan service on every episode. But this is actually a good thing in Cowboy Bebop.  Flagrant nudity would basically ruin the feel of the series and give you a different outlook on it all together.  For some that may be a downer, but for me it was refreshing to see a popular show that didn't set its entire basis around fan service.
With all of these things contributing to the anime being extremely well done, there is also a fair use of computer animation implemented with the anime itself.  For most other shows (Zoids, Pilot Candidate) this wasn't the smartest choice of action.  Cowboy Bebop takes computer animation, and puts other shows that use it to shame.  This is one of the few animes that can get away with an overuse of computer animation and end up with a series just as great as not having it.  I was fairly impressed with that.
On another note, this is also one of the few series that can pull off a good english dub as well as Japanese Sub.  Spike Spiegel's voice will have you questioning which is better, while Jet and Faye's english voice actors are scarily similar to the original's.
While discussing audio, it should be known that this show has a unique use of jazz, classic, etc. and can use it without setting the wrong mood.  The music is simply amazing as there are mixed themes for each episode....each track beautifully done.
The DVDs contain above-average extras also!  With trailers, bios, screen gallery, and interviews, how can you go wrong?  Extras just add to a great show's popularity and make the DVD a must-have over the VHS.
Now lets look at all of the good things about Cowboy Bebop that I went through:
-Great characters
-Great computer animation implement
-Great content
-Great music
-Great Dub & Sub
-Great action
-Great extras
-Great SHOW!
So many good things about this series makes it a must have for anyone who likes such other series like ""Trigun"" or ""Outlaw Star"".  This show is, by far, better than any other gun-slinger type.  Don't believe me?  Well, chances are you will probably like this unless you are one of the few that usually don't like this kind of show.  Try it for yourself before you make a commitment towards the DVD Boxset, this is for hardcore Cowboy Bebop fans only!  If only I could put more than 5 stars....*sigh*",1021593600,23,4676,4.599517490952955

The animation itself is fantastic, and the music, mostly original jazz compositions produced specifically for this series, is equally impressive.  These factors by themselves, however, are not what makes this such a worthwhile series.  What really does it are the characters, whose pasts and personalities are rolled out at a slow pace over the course of 26 episodes.  By the time loose ends begin to get tied up in Session 24, you are shocked to discover how deeply attached you are to these people, how real they seem despite their fairytale qualities.  I found myself speechless at the end of several episodes, genuinely grieving over the loss and sadness that played out on the screen.  Watch Bebop.

Also Spike follows the ways and fights like Bruce Lee.
Speaking of goofballs the character Ed or as she calls herself Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th can take a little getting use to.
Then also Jet Spike's Partner.

1647798,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop isn't just good anime. You'll read a lot of reviews that compare it to other groundbreaking anime like Akira and Ghost In The Shell, but that sells this excellent series short.
'Anime' describes not just a style of animation, but a collection of story conventions, none of which appear in Cowboy Bebop. There are no tentacled monstrosities, no Megacorporations conspiring to destroy NeoTokyo, no weird nature spirits being corrupted by consumerism.
Instead we're left with one of the best TV series' ever. Almost everything that happens will make perfect sense to the average western viewer, and it all stands up to any modern TV series... Because unlike all of these excellent shows, Cowboy Bebop switches tone, scope, and genre with almost every episode. One episode is slapstick farce, one is romantic soap opera, one is nail-biting action, one is tense psychothriller. And Cowboy Bebop never misses a beat, each episode is finely crafted with a level of detail given each 22 minutes that you'd normally have to watch an entire series of to see on HBO.
Cowboy Bebop also has something all other western shows lack; Yoko Kanno. Her music is sheer genius. She works playfully and seriously in every style, and thus fits these fantastic stories that are sometimes insightful, sometimes meaningful, sometimes sublime, sometimes ridiculous. Cowboy Bebop loves its own soundtrack and devotes one or two scenes each episode to showcase the music. The director intentionally lets Kanno's music come to the fore and orchestrates several scenes with no dialog in order to let the music shine. Few shows do this, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The emotional impact of each episode is raised to new levels though the use of her music, and you'd be a fool not to buy the soundtrack.
The series is a Sci-Fi romp set in the near future, our solar system. The main characters are bounty hunters (called 'cowboys') onboard a spaceship (the Bebop) owned by an inveterate jazz aficionado who dreams of Charlier Parker. 'Bounty hunter' may evoke dark mysterious characters like Boba Fett, and the main characters here *do* have mysterious pasts and they *are* lethal killers, but they're entirely human, living day to day on the few bounties they bring in. The characters can be serious, funny, sexy, goofy. . .everything you'd expect from realistically drawn characters who are, at the same time, lethal killers.
Don't mistake this for Anime, it obliterates the genre conventions and comes screaming out of the gate with a refreshing collection of stories that will make you pound your cable box and scream ""why can't it all be like this!?!"" The director and writer are aware of what they've created, these characters are living day by day, achieving nothing significant in their lives, yet they're having a great time and we have a great time with them. We don't want it to end. The main character asks us, ""Don't you want to hang out with us and waste your life away?"" The answer, of course, is 'yes,' and the writer knew it when he wrote it.
One aspect which is decidedly *not* western, is the ending. This show ends the only way it could, the most fulfilling way possible, and when the credits roll for the final time, you'll feel like you lived an entire lifetime in the past few hours.
And what a lifetime it was...",1017014400,19,3318,4.863957597173145

Word of advice:  The boxed set's DVD's inside are identical to those that you would have bought individually.  When they say 7 discs, its the six DVD's you would normally see in the store (each a different color), and then the sixth disc is the original soundtrack.  In other words, you are not really paying for any new media.
Around my area, the Cowboy Bebop DVD's sell for about ..., so buying the boxed set was a bargain.  However, if the price of 6 DVD's individually costs less than the posted price, then you'll be paying a premium for nothing.",1015632000,5,768,4.496402877697841
1647802,5,B00005QCW4,"If there ever was a show that I belived to be the greatest of all time, this would be it. With that said you know this review will be nothing but prasie, but don't scroll away just yet I have plenty more to say. To start, Cowboy Bebop takes place many years from now, normaly that can hurt a show but with this you'll like what you see. The time they live in is very much like out own, guns use bullets, not lasers, are computers, but no gigantic ones nor robots, and style very much exists. Dont let the fact that this takes place in space scare you either, the way space travil is perceved is very, very realistic. Spike Spiegel is the hero, but he isn't alone, theres plenty of character development from everyone. Spike is a man that anyone can like, he keeps his cool in bad situations, knows loads of matial arts thanks to jeet kune do, and knows just how to use weponds the cool way. His partner Jet Black isn't a thing like him but they work so well together. Jet is an ex-cop who now partnered up with spike to become bounty hunters using his ship The Bebop. He is balding but not all the much older then spike, he tries to be the brains of the group but can be often seen using brute force. Faye Valintine is the woman of the group, she is rude and paranoid, but she comes through when needed, trust me, you've never seen one like her. Speaking of something you've never seen the last and youngest member of the group is Ed, a 12 year old girl (yes girl) who is a genuis hacker who might just be insane. She is unlike all the other character because she does all the anime stuff, eye effects, crazy teeth, and yes of corse the random screaming of lines. To try to explain the plot of Cowboy Bebop to someone whois never seen it, would be to ruin it. All I can say is that cowboy bebop makes a fan out of anti-anime people. The music in this show is great that I bought all of the cd's. It isn't your normal anime sound track because it's all jazz, and some of the best jazz I've ever heard. By all means pull out your wallet, because you won't be disapointed, this show in the end is beautiful, inspiring, funny, action packed, mystrious, and calm. To put in other words I have never seen another show in all of the world that has ever made me so happy to talk about.

1647804,5,B00005QCW4,"This is, quite possibly, the best anime ever produced.
The story is set in the future.  The Earth has been rendered virtually uninhabitable by a star gate accident.  Humankind has terraformed several of the nearby planets and escaped to them.  Of course, escaping the Earth is one thing; escaping humanity is another...
Among the crowds of villains and victims, two bounty hunters set off on a quest to (literally) keep the bulldog fed.  Along the way they pick up a couple of women (in the most unconventional sense).  While all of them think they are in pursuit of happiness, they gradually come to realize they are instead running from their respective pasts -- and their pasts are catching up quickly.
Set to a largely instrumental, jazzy, and original score, with beautiful artwork, creative story lines, introspective philosophy, quirky humor, fast-paced spacecraft and faster hand-to-hand combat, Cowboy Bebop is everything anime was meant to be.

Transending all of that, the stories deal with subject matter that is as gritty as it's main characters: apocaliptic cults, environmental terrorists,and lost love but with enough comic relief to keep you laughing.

1647809,5,B00005QCW4,"I think it might be time for a critical analysis of the structural contents of Cowboy Bebop.
The primary metaphor in this series is, not surprisingly, that of a jazz ensemble.  The four main characters each perform their solo and unison parts with an individual style formed by their unique pasts.  However, there are elements in each character's past that they are seeking to escape.  By joining the ensemble, all four crew members of the Bebop seek to create new patterns, and construct a context in which they can continue to live, without acknowledging past concerns.
Spike, a former Yakuza now hunted by his earlier comrades, is both attracted to and repelled by memories of the love triangle that caused the betrayal of his old partner (Vicious).  As the main protagonist, Spike's search for a way to balance his old and new lives reflects on humanity at large.  How can we form new patterns if we're lost in old conflicts?  How can we transcend our own pasts, when that means denying our own existences?
The answers provided in Cowboy Bebop are mixed and gloomy.  We cannot, it seems, escape the conflicts that define ourselves as individuals.  The ensemble can only provide a temporary respite, and the ghosts of one's past must necessarily be faced alone.  But at least one can always go out with a bang.",1014076800,4,1313,4.774336283185841

Great backstory that you can't wait to unfold,a nd great storytelling in each episode, even the 'worst' of episodes you will want to watch again. The best part about it is that it doesn't all consist of serious things, it intergrates the humor seemlessly, without the stereo-typical anime-style of slapstic and downright silly humor. The animation is top notch throughout the series, and is a joy to watch. Also the soundtrack to this series has to be some of the best I've heard. From slide guitars, to saxophones, haunting melodies, jazzy chase songs and rock songs with a distinct sound. You'll find yourself listening to songs you would never be caught dead listening to before. And of course, lets not forget the characters, all are weighed as equal as could be throughout. Basically you aren't only following the story of one of the characters, but you grow to like them all.

Then I went through a stint of no anime, until I saw Cowboy Bebop. Constantly my friend and I get into heated debates on which is better ""Trigun"" or ""Cowboy Bebop."" Bebop is my vote.
Bebop is chockfull of jazzy-jazz caper coolness. It inspires. It even allows the most staunch jazz-hater to appreciate the music. The characters are the elitest of the elite. At first glance the biggest difference is it's lack of silly childlike expressions and slap-stick. It focuses on character, which is the main drive of any well-written story. Each episode leaves you with something to think about. You can also tell that the animators just had fun making it changing the logo during commercial breaks, the intense battle scenes, etc.
But to really appreciate it you need to rent or buy the dvds and watch them from the first episode to the last. You just cannot enjoy it any other way. I love sci-fi. And this is arguably one of the greatest animes along with trigun. The ending is depressing; but great because it strays from the norm and dares to be different. Whimsical stuff.",1013299200,2,1369,4.708333333333333

We spent the next two weeks watching everysingle one.
This Anime is unlike any i have ever seen before, touching, yet funny.  They do not make fun of stereotypical people, they use a touch of humor that almost any can understand.
The ending was my favorite, a very touching one, unlike most shows.  I won't say more, so i won't give it away.  However, Cowboy Bebop is never repetitive in its shows, each unique (perhaps why it ended so soon) and will always be a favorite of mine.",1013299200,,606,4.441441441441442
1647817,5,B00005QCW4,"This is the best anime series I have ever seen.  The writers did a phenominal job of making the episodes enjoyable individually, but they also all fit into a storyline and theme that you don't understand until it's too late..  I'm not exactly an emotional person, but I actually found myself getting misty-eyed for the last 2 episodes of the series (The Real Folk Blues is one episode)..  This anime carries a variety of messages, not easily expressed in words.  Oh, and I just got mine last week and I got number 8965 so if you want one I'd suggest hurrying up (if indeed the sales numbers are sequential at Amazon)  I faltered for a moment when it came to buying this, I'm VERY glad I did though.

I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing this. It's great how they went the extra mile to dub this great anime in English for all of us, although I still prefer to hear it in Japanese. Once you watch one episode, you can't stop. It's great fun seeing Spike Spiegel take on all the baddies, and still be able to crack jokes. It's serious when it needs to be, but also very hilarious.

1647819,4,B00005QCW4,"When I hear anime fans praising a new series I immediately become suspicious - I never could understand what on earth is so fantastic about Neon Genesis Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain, or all of the other series out there (although I haven't seen them all, of course). Anime fans are known to have pretty odd tastes - anyone who's not one knows that most animes out there described as ""fantastic"" by fans are usually far from being good. But this series really does deserve its good reputation and can be enjoyed by any person who doesn't have the prejudiced opinion that animation is for kids, or that Disney epitomizes animation (it does, in a sense, but only juvenile animation). This series is aimed at a mature audience, with often mature situations, involving blood, death, and although there is no sex, there is at least one memorable scene in episode 13 with strongly ""perveted"" sexual overtones (""perveted"" according to common tastes, that is).
It also stands out as the only anime I've seen having a decent soundtrack that doesn't sound amateurish - I'm not a fan of the composer, Yoko Kanno, and she
writes lyrics like a third grader, but her compositional skills are very
innovative and she has a real knack for song-writing.
The series has 26 chapters, each of which stands on its own (almost). It deals with the mishaps of 4 bounty hunters who try to make a living in the future. Although the year is 2071 it looks more like 1971 in terms of fashion, and the style is highly reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". I have really enjoyed the show and should add that it is probably the best series I've seen on TV in the past few years (not that I'm such a big expert on the subject). Really, it is very unique and you will remember it far longer than most other series out there after it ends.
Nevertheless I should point out this is perhaps not a masterpiece as many other
reviewers have pointed out. That is, the characters are almost purely archtypes -
we have the masterless ronin looking for redemption, Spike Spiegel; the strong,
independent woman who is really a softy inside, Faye Valentine; the rock-hard,
burly, huge, seemingly indifferent but in fact fatherly Jet - very predictable
characters who are, perhaps, imprinted on our collective subconscious (read The Hero With a Thousand Faces by Campbell for interesting view on that). The plots are
sometimes a bit silly, sometimes outrageous (in a funny way - in one episode the
actors accidently eat hallucinatory mushrooms), and usually well written. However,
as someone once pointed out, the stories remain the same through history, the story-tellers are the ones who change - and I liked these story tellers a lot.
Bottom line - don't take this series too seriously. Just try it out and enjoy! And don't watch too many episodes at once, or it'll end too fast ...",1012867200,2,2858,4.75251509054326

For the most part, anime to me has been infiltrated with too much cutesy gimmicks or way too much gratuitious sex and violence. But this series has the most mature yet moderated storylines ever. The series has INCREDIBLE rendering artistically. It has the technical tightness of ""Ghost in the Machine"" only with faster story pacing. The animation during the action sequences are as smooth as any John Woo inspirations. The mix of science fiction/western/film noir elements with a Bop Jazz soundtrack is absolutely mind blowing in originality. There are many influences from the already mentioned John Woo, to Robert Rodriguez, to Humphrey Bogart and to the kung-fu flicks of the Seventies.
If you have to start an anime DVD collection- this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. personally I can't wait for the movie ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" (the Japanese producers have definately been influenced by Western rock with this series!) to come out on DVD.",1012780800,,1087,5.044444444444444

Oh heavens, what a pretty box this is. So very pretty. It's almost worth it just so you can admire the box on your shelf.
But wait, there's more! As many have said before, Cowboy Bebop successfully blends many genres into a single series with astonishing success. Impressively, it also switches from lighthearted comedy to somber seriousness with startling effect. The tone varies wildly, but never fails to convince. The characters are all complex and likeable, and any viewer is likely to find a favorite.
Most of all, what I like about Bebop is its portrayal of friendship. The crew of the Bebop love and care for each other, but it's never stated. More often than not they're heard trying to convince themselves and each other that they couldn't care less, and would just as well be alone, but we know it's not true. Each time they split up, it might be for the last time, or it might not. Ultimately, they know their time together is temporary. And such is friendship in life. You pick up friends here, lose touch with some there. Your friends are whoever you're with, and they're your family whether you admit it to them or not.
There's much more to this fun, exciting, beautifully drawn, richly textured series, but that's my take. Also, these DVDs have one of the only *listenable* English anime dubs I've ever heard. You know, if you're into that stuff.",1012521600,,1533,4.598540145985401

1647838,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop is best known for its characterization, pulsating jazz music, and seamless art style. So, what could be better than a limited boxed set with EVERY SINGLE session complete with an OST? Nothing.
At first glance, you may notice that there doesn't seem to be a plot. All you see for the first episode are two bounty hunters who seem to spend most of their time drifting thru the solar system. At a closer look, the chracters seem more human and have their own conflicts, quirks, and (gasp) personalities. Spike Spiegel is a carefree ""cowboy"" with a shady past, possibly dealing with the Red Dragon Syndicate, a type of mafia run by a council of old people. If seems Spike has some heck of a past life, but decided to run away. Then there's Jet Black, an ex-ISSP (interstellar solar system police) officer who also had a somewhat mysterious past. As Spike and Jet travel in Jet's junk ship, the Bebop, they encounter a lot of strange people and animals. First is Ein, an intelligent Welsh Corgi capable of surpassing his expectations. Then there's Faye Valentine, who has a huge debt on her head and decides to stick with the Bebop crew. She loves gambling, but always manages to find/lose money. The last member is Edward Hau Wong Pepelu Tivrusky IV, or Ed for short. A genius computer hacker under the alias, ""Radical Edward"", Ed also tags along.
From reading this review, I bet you can already tell that Bebop is made of a strange cast of characters. However, in each ""session,"" Spike, Faye, Ed, and Jet deal with their internal conflicts and problems with some help from one another. Another brilliant aspect of Cowboy Bebop is how the characters are not perfect, they all have cracks on/below the surface. Spike is lanky but handsome in his own way. Though Faye is sometimes the center of fanservice, she still isn't overtly drawn like *some other* female anime characters.
The music is another portion of CB to rave about. If you don't know who Yoko Kanno is, you better start getting used to hearing that name. She is best known for Macross and Escaflowne, and her expertise is brilliantly lended to Cowboy Bebop. The opening immediately drew me in and I never get tired of listening to ""Tank!"" Good songs play thruout the show and it helps bring the moody atmosphere if it is dramatic, or light feeling if it is comedic.
So this is my review. To call Cowboy Bebop a classic is like calling Evangelion revolutionary. Watanable Shinichiro did do an excellent job. He helped changed the anime genre not too much, but just a little bit to influence future anime productions to take the usual anime plot, and twist it to make an unforgettable show.",1010793600,9,2659,4.683760683760684

1647840,5,B00005QCW4,"My only consolation these last two weeks that I've been sick during my winter vacation is that I got to stay home in bed and watch all 26 episodes found in this Boxed Set.  Cowboy Bebop along with Trigun are my all-time favorite anime series.  If you're already familiar with the series and are wondering if the DVD set itself is high-quality, well, don't hesitate and get this now.  The visuals, soundtrack, and voice-acting are all fantastic.  Plus the DVD comes with extra features such as interviews and character summaries on the backcover of the CD case.

If you're new to the series, let me elaborate why this set is a must-buy.
Cowboy Bebop is different from many existing anime series in that it doesn't use over-the-top slapstick comedy.  Instead, it opts for carefully-crafted storytelling, stylistic visuals, and mood-setting soundtracks.  Each episode moves at both a methodical and carefree pace.  Indeed, this series may be best described as an existential sci-fi soap opera.  Each of the main characters on the spaceship Bebop seem jaded on the surface and seem only halfway interested in rounding up bounties.  What really gets each character riled up, and what moves the series along very well, are the questions and mysteries from their pasts.  In dealing with their pasts (long lost lover, betrayal of a friend, and forgotten family), the characters find that their lives are really worth living when they have something to die for.  Spike is the ultimate cool hero; Jet, is the reluctant friend and Faye is the con artist with a heart.  This is a series that you won't want to end, but will stay true to its spirit.",1010361600,13,1636,4.841726618705036

Each Session can stand on its own yet keeps the central theme going in this action packed Anime of bounty hunting, soul finding, vengeance seeking fun!

The Boxed set is the best boxed set I own.  A step above the rest.  The box is more like a case.  It's sturdy and easy to get the DVD's out.  And it comes with a soundtrack.

Put compared to Cowboy Bebop all three of those fall short by a long shot.  First the characters:  We have our classic anti-hero Spike, with his cool persona and mysterious past he's not exactly an original take on your main character, but somehow seems fresh.  Faye is your average attractive chick thrown in, but she too seems fresh.  Jet is the the more sane individual who proves vital to the team, and from there it gets rather odd with a 9 year old hacker genius in Ed and a super smart dog named Ein.
The story is only really present in about 6 or so episodes, the rest of the series is totally off track, usually just explaining the characters pasts better.

Cowboy Bebop is made by people that KNOW what should be in a good show.

It's rare to see such clean, smooth and fluid animation as seen in this series, along with creative perspectives and ""camera"" tricks throughout.
The characters are fairly easy to relate to, both in their victories and heartaches.  I read someone's thoughts on the character Ed being unrealistic, but I think when contrasted against the ""real"" characters, it almost makes you feel as if Ed isn't comedy relief, but tragically mentally underdeveloped or insane.  I really felt that way, and was deeply attached to Ed as well as all of the other characters.
Action, Drama, Comedy, SciFi, Conspiracies and more themes are found throughout the series.
 Lastly, I wanted to agree with another reviewer who said that the english dub was excellent.  I too agree that the english voice actors are even more appropriately chosen than the original japanese voice actors.  I too have watched both, and though in most cases (Life is Beautiful, Run Lola Run, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, etc.) I prefer the subtitled version, with Bebop, I prefer the english dub hands down.

As a avid movie and anime watcher, I find most things boring, but Cowboy Beebop was the most moving, fantastic, and wonderfull thing I've ever watched.  anyone who has doubts should just read some of these reviews.  With its mixture of beutiful anamaion, thrilling fights, and unbelliveble mixing of conteporary jazz (The soundtrack is one of the best parts) Cowboy Beebop is a winner.",1006905600,,505,4.91764705882353
1647856,5,B00005QCW4,Everyone else has already mentioned how well done the rest of the show is I just thought the quality of the dub should be brought up.  After having watched it both subtitled and dubbed I'd have to say the English voices may have been picked even better than the origional Japanese. None of the meaning is lost due to bad translation all the voices suit the characters perfectly and the lines are delivered with all the apropriate emotion.,1006819200,2,438,4.615384615384615

The animation is superb (I ought to know being an animator) and the writing is ever better still.  There is no question about owning this DVD set: you must get it.",1006819200,,331,4.125
1647858,5,B00005QCW4,"Cowboy Bebop is unlike anything that I've ever seen. At first glance, it might appear to follow all the conventions of anime. A rugged pair of bounty hunters. An alluring woman with a mysterious past. An arch-foe of unbelievable skill and ruthlessness. A perky young teenage sidekick and her pet dog.
But then, Bebop is nothing conventional.
The episodes can vary quickly from lighthearted and warm to grim and gothic, and vice-versa. The characters are unique, and we watch them grow as the series goes on. The score is beautiful, and the songs for the soundtrack are deeply haunting.
Or course, the presence of Radical Edward, the most refreshing character in anime in awhile, is worth the money alone. But that's not the only reason to get this set.
This series plays out to the end like a John Woo film, relying on stunning imagery, characters who are both larger than life and yet at the same time achingly human, and action sequences that are at times fun romps and others desperate fights for survival.
Not for the younger set, that much is for sure.",1006732800,7,1057,4.718918918918919

I bought this first tape, watched it, then went out to buy the rest of the series and watched it in one day...THAT is the quality of Cowboy Beebop. Look, the same people who did this also created the unbelievable, incredible Macross Plus series (Buy that one too, the 4 disc series, not the movie).
But be warned: this is true Anime, not Pokecrap, Stinky Moon or Digidull. Once you watch this, you will never want to see that stuff again.",1006646400,,606,4.371681415929204

The Cartoon Network is providing a great service for all by increasing the worlds' exposure to Cowboy Bebop, but alas, they are *not* showing the uncut original episodes/sessions.
Even though CB is playing under the 'Adult Swim' hours, the episodes are still editted for excessive violence, sexual references, some smoking and some occasional raw language.
To give the reader an idea of how much merit this series has:  I tell you my DVD collection consists of Braveheart, The Princess Bride, and the Cowboy Bebop Collectors set.
This is art.",1006214400,4,567,5.096774193548387
1647862,5,B00005QCW4,"Well Im going to start off by telling you about the boxset it self.  It has the 6 seasons dvd, the first ost, and well the box.  This is the coolest box ever.  It's like a case, you can open it and close it.  Very tough quality, not just boxset where you slide the dvds in like robotech, or die hard.  The ost is pretty good, but im not much of a jazz fan so i can't give a review on that.
Cowboy Bebop is probably one of the coolest series to hit the states.  It's a lot better then Outlaw Star or Trigun, some may disagree.  It's not a series that continues on and on.  Each ep has it's own plot.  The overall layout is that it reveals each charater's past bit by bit.  At first I found the music to be boring, but as it went along, I got with the beat.  There isn't much thinking to do, it's pretty much flat out action most of the time.
If you haven't watch a lot of anime, or you only watch stuff on Cartoon Network, pick this up.  It's probably going to be the first serious anime you will see.",1006214400,24,1000,3.9203980099502487
1647863,4,B00005QCW4,"Awesome.  Just awesome.  Cowboy Bebop is definetely the best show in its genre.  The only other action show that is up there next to Bebop is Rurouni Kenshin.  Cowboy Bebop takes the award for the best show set in the future and Rurouni Kenshin takes the award for best show set in the past.
Anyway.  The Perfect Sessions is a great release besides that fact that most fans (probably all.  Well except for me I only have session 6)  bought all of the single DVDs!  Well thats just great.  Is it really worth paying this amount of money for just extras?  I don't know.  I suppose if you were a hardcore bebop fan (I know some, in fact they are so hardcore that it goes to a level of being really annoying)  you wouldn't think twice about buying this, even if you did have all of the single DVDs.  Also, if it were ""perfect"" they would wait a little longer so they could release the Cowboy Bebop movie: Knockin' on Heavens Door with it.  Then it would be perfect.  (By the way, that movie is awesome, I encourage you do download it, buy it fansubbed whatever, just as long as you get a copy.  Its a thing not to be missed!)
Well, moving on.  I guess I should say some stuff about the series.  My friends (the hardcore fans) all say that the dubbing is better than the Japanese.  No matter what ANYBODY says NO anime has better dubbing then the original Japanese.  They say they like it because they make it more 'poetic'.  I say thats complete bs.  The only reason why they change some of the lines is because they either need to make it shorter to fit the mouth movements, or longer.  And I mean think about it, wouldn't you want to change to the dialogue to something that you like, something that you think is nicer than the original?  There you go.  Perhaps the original Japanese version in some parts (Theres a line that goes ""you shall shed red tears"" in the subbed and in the dubbed its ""You shall cry tears of scarlet"")  they aren't TRYING to be poetic!  Its just the dubbing that makes it that way.  Well now that I've cleared up that subbing allways is better I should movie on to the story.  Bebop takes place in the future, but not to distant future.  To tell the truth I forgot the date.  I think its 2071 or something along those lines.  But anyway.  A series of hyper space gates connect the planets which all house colonies.  You travel between the gates.  The galaxy is a dangerous place, there are a series of syndicates such as the Red Dragon syndicate.  Its like a whole bunch of gangs.  So anyway, because of the fact there are so many criminals there are many bounty hunters who capture the criminals and turn them in for rewards.  Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein are bounty hunters.  (Well, Ed only is a hacker on the team and Ein's a super smart Welsh Corgi)  The story progresses and you find out more about Spikes past, how he was part of the Red Dragon Syndicate and about his enemy/past friend Vicious and his old girlfriend Julia.  Between the eps about Spike there are eps about Fayes past, Jets, and also just them going around and stopping criminals.  But the story isn't the only good part.  The soundtrack plays a major roll.  Jazz etc.  Its awesome.  Composer Yoko Kanno makes such great music!!!
I think I've said too much just see the series.",1006041600,3,3274,4.363787375415282

1647867,5,B00005QCW4,"This is far and away the best anime series I have seen so far.  What an excellent collection.  Where does one begin? More mature themed than Outlaw Star, and more episodic, the writing of the stories is far and above anything else currently out there.  I watched all the DVDs one after another to collect the whole experience after having seen the first couple episodes on Toonami.  Unlike Outlaw Star with its severely extroverted cast, the characters in Bebop are very slow to peel away their facades to show their histories.  Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein, and Edward begin very mysteriously in their own way.  Each protagonist has their own sordid past they attempt to deal with while shielding the others from it.  Spike, the lanky, Lupin-like face man shows his serious side in the Ballad of Fallen Angels which contains a wonderfully operatic scene where he is thrown out of a window of a church, in the rain.  He flashes back through an earlier harsh episode of his life as he and the stained glass fall in tandem, in slow motion, to a beautifully tinkling music box score.  There didn't seem to be a journey of discovery the way there was with Outlaw Star, driving the series.  However, the build up to the last few episodes was very impressive.  I was reminded of the epic sweep of the DeNiro movie `Heat' as Spike set out to confront his nemesis, his love, and his past.  It left me feeling quite drained watching it to the last.  While I wouldn't go so far as to say the characters are likeable, they are compelling in their own flawed ways.  The use of music was also very advanced in the series, ranging from classical arias, to punk, to metal, to techno - all to the benefit of the plot and the fluid movements of the combatants.  Very highly recommended, I just hope I can find something similar in the future.",1004572800,36,1818,4.533742331288344
1647868,5,B00005QCW4,"I started to collect this series after falling in love with the first session disc. COWBOY BEBOP is the ultimate in cool anime. The animation is superb with highly detailed backgrounds, lovely drawn characters and some simply mind blowing CG work. This is anime eye candy, but the stories are so brilliant I'd class it as much, much more. Each story is beautifully done and has a enormous amount of depth. Some of the stories are two-parters and the whole series builds the characters nicely, as more characters are slowly introduced. The series takes place on board a space ship called the BEBOP where a group of bounty hunters are trying to make a living. We follow each character on their own personal journey throughout the series. The stories weave there way over a number of topics and this series has a  very colourful look and is also a lot of fun.

  Cowboy Bebop, is a fantastic anime series.  It has humor and action, but the show is not dominated by that.  The feel is a suprisingly workable blend of future and past.  The charachters have many faults to accompany their strengths.
  That alone won't make the show however.  The show is held by how well it is done.  The voice-acting is incredibly real.  The show is never preachy, boring, or dragged out(no excessive action scenes or monologues).  The music is amazing by itself, but when placed in the show it is a driving force.

Besides the eye-poppingly smooth animation with CG enhancements, the story was gritty,dark, and even hilarious at times. One truly feels for the main characters as they progress through the seemingly isolated storylines. They all tie up together in the climactic (and untlimately sad)last 2 episodes. I would recommend this series to anyone remotely interested in Anime, or is in the mood for just a great series in general. I mean, you have spacships...guns....and beautiful babes...what more could you ask for in a series?!",1003881600,5,699,4.932203389830509
1647872,5,B00005QCW4,"I have never written a review before, nor do I plan to often in the future, but I felt that I ought to give it a shot here.

  I'll leave out a lot of preliminary posturing and tell you straight up.  As a long-time anime fan who has seen it all, from two-bit pulp series like Pokemon and Dragonball to art-house favorites like Akira and Princess Mononoke, I can say that Cowboy Bebop is, hands down, the finest anime ever produced for the small screen.
  As with all creative works that are based on words (or a combination of words and images) the most important thing in a television series, be it anime or otherwise, is the writing. Needless to say, the writing in this series (Keiko Nobumoto receives the ""Screenplay"" credit, which I can only assume means that she was the head writer) is utterly fantastic and the translators have done a great job of conveying the real meaning and feel of the Japanese dialogue in English, rather than just translating word for word [Note: this applies to the subtitles, I NEVER watch dubbing; and yes, I do speak Japanese].  The individual episodic plots are well constructed and there is always the spectre of the overarching ""uber-plot"" mysteriously tantalizing you in the background.  The characters are well-realized, interesting and three-dimensional, with the notable exception of Ed, the hacker, whose annoying presence is a result of the production company's desire to pander to a particular demographic of Japanese viewer.  Fortunately, this character is not much used and the other three, Spike, Faye and Jet, are so cool and so interesting that the series could consist solely of the three of them sitting around, playing Mah Jongg and there would still be enough sexual tension and biting wit to keep it enthralling.
  The show also has a great deal of variety in the flavor and character of its episodes, demonstrating the writers' versatility.  Some installments are funny, others action-packed and others quietly introspective, or a combination thereof. The sci-fi (the anime takes place in a world that is both futuristic and retro) is very tight, and one of the show's real strengths is the realization of the world it takes place in.  All the little details are in place and watching the show really can transport you.
  Aside from the writing, the direction and overall look of Cowboy Bebop are beautiful and utterly cool.  If you are at all a fan of jazz music or the jazz era in general, you'll love the color scheme, the inking and the lines.  Director Shinichiro Watanabe does a fantastic job of creating the feel of coolness from days gone by while keeping you all the while, decidedly in the future.  He plays with angles, rapid cuts, stills with voiceover, extreme close-ups and many other techniques, some of which can only be accomplished in an animated medium.  He also makes great use of computer graphics, which not only helps bolster the futuristic feel, but gives Cowboy Bebop access to effects that few other animes have.  All in all, the direction and production values, from the opening credits on, is totally top-drawer.  It's not surprise that Cowboy Bebop was one of the more expensive anime series ever produced.
  As for the music, what can I say?  It features the compositions of perhaps the most-talented, versatile and interesting composer in Japanese show-business and certainly the greatest composer of music for animes alive today: Yoko Kanno.  Her score to Cowboy Bebop takes all the best elements of jazz, pops, rock, classical and blues and wraps it all up in a score so wonderful that it is impossible that any TV series anywhere ever had a better one.  If you're interested in the feel of the series, but don't want to commit to a DVD, try one of the OST Albums and I guarantee you'll pick up the DVD the next day.
  I could go on, I could talk about the series itself, let slip some small details or give you a taste of the show's dynamic, but I think I've said enough.  This is one of the few animes that I have ever seen that really is cool, fun and never, ever insults your intelligence.  If more animes were like this our dates would perhaps not walk out on us upon the mention of our membership in the anime club.  This is the epitome, the entelechy, the exegesis of all that is good about anime.  Get it.",1003708800,,4303,4.703604806408545

  But really folkz, it's da best show! In most Anime seriez, the animation is really lame and pasty, but Bebop has a nice, smoothe image. Also, the show has a true variety.

1647874,5,B00005QCW4,"Spike is Bounty Hunter with a mysterious past of which we will know more about one piece at a time.
The story will appeal to people who like action and to people who love complex characters.  Spike is as complicated as it gets and although the series takes it time to develop him,  it does it tastefully and without useless or uninteresting episodes.  And the last 2 eps are so touching I was totally overwhelmed with the feeling that filled the room.  But he doesn't get their without tons of bad guys which this anime amazingly takes time to develop characters of.
Animation that will amaze you in it's rich color and ""westernized"" characters.  It takes a step back from the usual anime that we've come to love.
Many people say that Bebop and Trigun go together.  I feel it isn't so.  Trigun is very japanese and their character mystery is paper thin,  even though it is fun to watch it just simply gets ridiculous at times, and it gets worse as the anime goes on.
