6983927,5,B00SHEOWTQ,"If you're looking for a hidden gem comedy anime then D-Frag is what you're looking for.  Kenji is somewhat of a delinquent, or at least he think he his.  He and his buddies are on a mission to rule the school.  That's until he is forced to join the Game Development Club run by four pretty psychopaths.

I can't remember the last time an anime made me laugh so much, but on top of that the animation style is one of the best I've seen in years too.  There's just so much color in it that matches the situations in a prefect way every time.  Furthermore, each episode is packed with hyperboles and innuendos, but are never over used.  They are so well placed that all the hyperboles have become one of my favorite parts of the show.  Even the characters all flow together perfectly, which makes them all very likable, especially Kenji and Koka.  Bottom line is if you like comedy anime that exaggerate on almost everything then you'll probably like D-Frag.

This Limited Edition Blu-ray release of D-Frag! features all first season episodes presented in 1080p with English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0 lossless audio tracks and English subtitles.

6983943,5,B00SHEOWTQ,"- Synopsis: Our protagonist is a big-shot, or so he thought until he met a group of cute but eccentric and borderline psychotic ladies. From the moment he met them, his mental and physical well-being started going down-hill. Tune in to see if the protagonist is able to handle these cute but deadly-in-their-own-way girls in this whacky comedy.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This is a silly comedy with plenty of outrageous situations. The fan-service may be on the lower-end when compared with other animes, but if you don't mind it, the anime will still be enjoyable. Though, this is great for those that like comedy in general, however, if you prefer something more thought-provoking, this might not be for you. If you enjoy pranks and the like, then this might be a comedy to consider.

- Analysis: This depicts plenty of dialogue and interactions. This may infer to the fact that relationships, however significant or not, are an undeniable part of life. That is, it is inseperable  just as the contrasting harmony of light and darkness: Two opposites that cannot be separated. Just like life and death.

As the viewer was probably aware, especially when considering the characters of this anime, everybody (doesn't matter who) has issues. These girls in particular are dangerous in their unique ways. But as many people will learn, a true friend accepts another person for who they are. So it's all good, since our protagonist displays adaptability. Everyone's got their strengths and weaknesses, after all.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 on 2 DVDs for a total of 4 discs. Approximate run-time of 5 hours and is rated TV-14 for fan-service and suggestive scenes.

- Conclusion: A whacky comedy with an overall light-hearted tone. Great for anime viewers that enjoy silly, over-the-top situations and cute girls.  Though this isn't for those with dry-humor, it is still appealing for those that want an anime to have some laughs with. This anime also portrays that females can be a source that shortens the life-span of men.

6983949,5,B00SHEOWTQ,"I've always been draw to anime because unlike most Western animation, anime often tries to tell us mature, emotionally gripping stories that may change your outlook and beliefs. Shows like Code Geass and Fullmetal Alchemist taught me about the consequences of war and the value of humanity while shows like Cowboy Bebop taught me that the mistakes we make define us. Still, sometimes you want to watch a show just for the fun of it; philosophy and ethics be damned, sometimes you just want to be fed crazy storylines and awesome visuals. Shows like FLCL and Panty & Stocking may not give us much food for thought, but they're entertaining and insane and that's all you need. So, for the ADD child in all of us, welcome to D-Frag!

D-Frag! follows the exploits of one Kenji Kazama, a high school student and leader of a small gang of wannabe delinquents. While Kenji tries to look tough on the surface, he's really a decent guy underneath it all. Shortly after the school semester begins, Kenji finds himself forced into joining the ""Game Creation Club"", a club of three adorable yet insane girls who are willing to resort to torture to get him to join (they need four members to stay a club). Kenji begrudgingly joins this very peculiar outfit and soon finds himself entangled in all manner of odd situations.

The Game Creation Club tries to invent new games (board games, for example) that they then show off at school functions, but that's really only part of the story. It turns out, the Game Creation Club that Kenji is forced to join started as an offshoot of the first GCC (they design video games). A lot of conflict and internal strife ensues as Kenji finds himself embroiled in grudge matches and competitions that often make no sense whatsoever. Therein lies the charm of D-Frag!; it doesn't take itself very seriously.

Each story arc finds Kenji caught up in the insanity of both the old and the new Game Creation Clubs as well as rival school gangs; Kenji's basically our straight man who can't catch a break no matter how hard he tries. That is exactly why I love this show; nothing ever seems to make sense  and Kenji doesn't mind pointing that out. Most of the characters we meet are quirky and odd in all number of ways, from a narcoleptic teacher to the masochistic vice president of the school, there's no shortage of lovable weirdos to be found here. What makes the show so fun to watch is seeing all of these characters interact and cause problems for each other. There isn't all that much in the way of character development because, quite frankly, there's no need for it; the plot's never particularly serious and neither are our main characters.

Visually, the show is quite pleasant to look at. Expressive characters that exhibit fluid animation as well as bright colors that leap off the screen when things get chaotic; lots of eye candy to be sure. An anime can only ever be as good as its animation, and D-Frag! won't let you down in that department.

The one disappointment I have with this show is that it's kind of short. It's only 12 episodes long and there doesn't seem to be a sequel coming anytime soon. But then, that could also serve as a compliment of kinds; I want more of a good thing.

To sum it up, D-Frag! is one of those shows like FLCL that is, first and foremost, there to entertain you through over-the-top characters and storylines and crazy set-piece moments. It's nothing thought-provoking or philosophical and it's never particularly deep or insightful beyond the occasional lesson on the importance of friendship. D-Frag! is the kind of show you can turn off the more serious parts of your psyche for, because this a crazy show that just wants to get you to smile. It's pretty to look at and fun to experience and that's high praise for the kind of show this is. Buy it and enjoy it, it's just that simple.",1463788800,3,3859,4.624817518248175

6983973,5,B00SHEOWTQ,"I'm only a casual anime viewer, but the majority of shows I've watched have been the 'straight man is dragged into crazy high school club against his will, girls throw themselves at him and he is oblivious' cliche. At this point, I just expected this to be another one of those.

Wrong.

D-Frag is actually hilarious. Look, I've watched some funny anime, but it usually comes with caveats... e.g.: perhaps you have to understand the culture to find the humour in it. Not here. This is the most genuinely humorous anime I've ever seen. The humour is abstract, but somehow develops organically. It's not so non-sequitur that the characterisation and narrative flow is lost. Each storyline is connected with the last in some way, despite the incredibly absurdist nature of the situations. All of the characters have something great to offer, including the many, many supporting characters. Each minor character is fleshed out and given unique attributes. As for the main characters, Kazama, the straight man, is not your usual oblivious introvert. And Takao, well, what starts as your run-of-the-mill tsundere develops into one of the best characters in years.

I cannot overstate how awesome and unexpected this anime was. It takes a lot for me to go out and start the manga, but I've done it with D-Frag, and let me say that the manga is just as good.

Here's hoping for a season 2.",1438560000,6,1381,4.838983050847458

8698349,5,B00SHEOWTQ,"Im generally new to anime at the time of this review, but after watching the entire show I can safely say I really enjoy the randomness of the humor and antics.

Kenji Kazama and his two friends are the schools newest batch of dilinquents (or as someone put it, fresh hicks from the country), Kenji wanting to conquer the world with his fist. However, the minute he stumbles into the Game Creation Club, his life forever changed - for better AND for worse. These girls are not your typical girls: one enjoys tazing, another forces water down the throats of her victims, another likes burying her victims up to their necks and the last one... is their teacher. How will Kenji cope after finding himself joining this sadistic club?

The very first episode sets the tone for the characters crazy antics, there is no shortage of jokes, moderate fanservice, and just plain good artwork. Also, elemental types. Nuff said.

All in all, I really enjoyed my time watching this, despite being my first attempt at watching something entirely culturally different from what Im used to. If you want to watch anime, and are a first-timer, I definitely recommend this one, if only for its random humor. Trust me. Youll be in for the time of your life.",1532822400,,1236,4.686635944700461
