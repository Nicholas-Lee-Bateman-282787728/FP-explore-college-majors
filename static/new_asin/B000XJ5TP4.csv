3002520,5,B000XJ5TP4,"My teenagers brought this movie home and had me rolling with them!  It's a parody about a documentary on two overage rappers who haven't grown up and moved on with the times.  Lots of laugh out loud humor and some gross out guy stuff, but the female audience will get a kick out of it, too. Not for small children, but ok to watch with your teens.  They might have to catch you up on some of the lingo! If you liked Cheech and Chong, you'll love Murder Mike and DuRag!!",1202169600,2,469,4.131868131868132

8228329,5,B000XJ5TP4,Loved every minute of this mockumentary! Those that grew up with gangsta rap and like to laugh will love it! Too bad more people don't know about this hidden treasure!,1457827200,,167,4.6
8228330,5,B000XJ5TP4,This movie is hilarious. Underfunded production makes it even funnier.,1451520000,,70,6.1

8228332,5,B000XJ5TP4,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll question your ethnicity, a documentary with a well-developed plot and top notch editing. 10/10, would watch again.",1384905600,,147,5.7272727272727275
8228333,2,B000XJ5TP4,"The sound track -- which I also own -- sums about all that is good in the DVD. Buy it instead, and find something else to occupy your eyes.",1362009600,,139,3.8275862068965516

8228335,3,B000XJ5TP4,"This movie was, quite frankly horrible. I went into this movie planning to watch with an open mind, but I found very little of comedic value. There were a few minor parts that were funny, but the whole movie felt like a home movie with no real purpose. If you look up the movie on youtube, you'll find all of the funny parts and in addition you won't have to sift through the trash. The movie is not intentionally bad, intending to add humor; it is literally bad.

The soundtrack on the other hand, is brilliant, and the best parody of the Gangsta Rap genre I've heard. You can tell that the songs actually had a lot of thought put into them, with intelligent references mixed in with the stereotypical gangster trash talking. In many of the songs, the lyrics appear to be able to pass for serious gangsta rap, but then an unexpected twist will turn the whole thing into a joke. To anyone that has listened to hardcore gangsta rap, it is obvious that the artists who wrote the songs know their ""gangsta"" and at the same time are talented and witty satirists.

Overall, I would recommend the soundtrack highly, but the movie shouldn't even be given a passing glance. I give the soundtrack 5 stars, but if I could I would rate the movie in the negatives.",1270339200,,1252,4.439130434782609
8228336,5,B000XJ5TP4,"I was expecting something corny but what I saw was intelligently comedy that had me laughing out loud.  Leslie Jones and Howie Bell as mother and son was hilarious! After renting it, I immediatly bought a copy from Amazon.  I hope that more people get to see this comedy gem.",1239667200,,275,4.48
8228337,4,B000XJ5TP4,Atlease I think so. Other people I have showed the movie too didn't like it as much. It's really not that bad.,1211068800,2,110,4.045454545454546
