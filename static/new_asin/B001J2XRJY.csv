8311812,3,B001J2XRJY,I was fortunate enough to see this in Seattle as part of the Cinematic Titanic tour by the folks from MST3K. Even without their input this movie is hysterical without meaning to be. Take careful note how the extras are Asian but the main characters are not.,1452211200,,257,4.48936170212766

8311814,3,B001J2XRJY,"Sure this movie met my satisfaction. I was not expecting a great movie but it's a fun one. I'm ordering a lot of ""drive-in"" movies lately and could only remember one scene from this one so it was fun to see what the rest of it was about. Shipping was pretty fast so yeah I'm happy!",1397347200,,281,4.035714285714286
8311815,3,B001J2XRJY,"Not bad pair of sword-and-sandal films.  The second, Ali Baba and the Seven Saracens is pretty OK in quality.  The main title, Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World is fair in quality but it is only about 68 minutes in length.  Disappointing.  The Alpha DVD release is better quality and about 77 minutes long.  In this case go with Alpha.  The main plus of this DVD is that it has some good sword-and-sandal trailers.  It is worth keeping for that alone.  A lot of the Retromedia DVD films are not cleaned up and improved.  Hopefully these two films will be re-mastered someday.",1395532800,,584,4.538461538461538
8311816,4,B001J2XRJY,"It seems that Bayview Entertainment has obtained Retromedia Entertainment's out of print sword and sandal double feature packages and are re-releasing them sporadically but I think this one slipped through my fingers until now.  Here we have a good double bill of mayhem in the Middle East and the Orient courtesy of two features imported by American International in the sixties and sold to television.  First up is Director Riccardo Freda's 'SAMSON AND THE SEVEN MIRACLES OF THE WORLD' aka 'MACISTE ALLA CORTE DEL GRAN KHAN'-1962, one of a handful of strong man features that American actor Gordon Scott made in Italy after his stint as Tarzan.  Unfortunately, AIP figured US audiences would not recognize the Maciste name so they labeled him Samson or Goliath depending on the whim.  Scott's Maciste/Goliath films are great fun and this one delivers the goods on all levels.  It includes Yoko Tani and the gorgeous Helene Chanel supplying the beauty and Leonardo Severini and Franco Russell layering out the villainy.  The film is presented in Widescreen so you can appreciate the scope of the venture, however, the years have not been kind to the Eastman Color dyes so the quality fluctuates and it seems it was culled from 16mm so the splices run rampant throughout.  Fairing slightly better (but still splicy) is the second bonus feature Director Emimmo Salvi's 'ALI BABA AND THE SEVEN SARACENS' aka 'SINBAD CONTRO I SETTE SARACENI'-1964.  This film seems to share the same  credits and cast as Director Umberto Scarpelli's 'THE GIANT OF METROPOLIS' aka 'IL GIGANTE DI METROPOLIS- 1961 as both Bella Cortez and appearing as a villain for once Gordon Mitchell (wearing some very bad eye liner) and Director Salvi supplied the screenplay.  Actor Dan Harrison aka Bruno Piergentili plays Ali Baba/Sinbad who falls in love with Mitchell's niece and complicates matters.  You will also hear music by Italo Fischetti ripping off cues from composer Carlo Rustichelli's score to the Steve Reeves classic Director Arthur Lubin's 'THE THEIF OF BAGDAD' aka 'IL LADRO DI BAGDAD- 1961 (only nerds like me would notice that). This transfer is also from 16mm with better color but, alas, full screen.  Five rare muscleman trailers are included as a bonus and they are all in widescreen including a trailer to 'ALI BABA' bearing the 'SINBAD' Italian title and adding insult to injury by having it with better color and the ability to enjoy the scope image.  Both films are hoots and great diversions for Saturday matinee screenings at home( to bring back the memories). 'SAMSON' is light years ahead of the full screen release available on the Alpha label and where will you see a print of 'ALI BABA' as if nowadays anyone cares?  A great purchase for the price.  Keep em' coming, Bayview.",1389398400,2,2779,4.984848484848484
8311817,5,B001J2XRJY,"There is another way to get this movie in true wide screen, and for 15.49 cents you get 49 other movies similar to this one. Its sold here on amazon and its called [Warriors 50 Movie Pack Collection 2006]. Most of the movies in this set are pan and scan with varying degrees of quality. But this movie Sampson and the Seven Miracles of the World is in this set, in true wide screen. Its on disc 7 side A. The colors are not perfect but its totally watchable. This whole set is really cool and all the movies are very watchable. Its well worth the 15.49. Its put out by the Mill creek Company. Thought i would offer this info for anyone looking for a great deal. That cost works out to be just a hair over 30 cents a movie! That's about what it probably cost to go see this at the movies when it was a new movie. Enjoy!",1326758400,4,818,4.055555555555555
8311818,5,B001J2XRJY,"Just a note . The Ultimate Hero;s edition mentioned on this page is the full version with decent color,but its not Widescreen

Its the Full Frame Alpha sells with the picture cropped top and bottom to give you a 1.85 ratio.

So you lose massive bits of picture not only from the sides ,but top and bottom as well.

 The only way to see Samson in full 2.35.1 is Retromedia's short version,with reasonable color.
in fact its perfectly acceptable,so nice to see the proper 2.35.1.ratio.
The Color is quite good really.

 Just thought I would clear that up.
 Highly Recommended

The second feature Ali Baba is Pan & Scan and good color ,and quite a good fim.
Some great Trailers for Sword and Sandal that haven't been released yet.
Who could resist titles like Julia Caesar and the Pirates. WOW.
Thanks Retromedia.",1289779200,,810,4.654929577464789
8311819,1,B001J2XRJY,"I've always liked this film a great deal. The plot of Samson helping a far Eastern country had the right mix of exotic for my tastes. Over the years I've picked up several different copies of this film looking for the best possible presentation. When Retromedia announced that that they were going to put out a widescreen version of the film I was excited. When the film came out I delayed in picking it up a little bit, but  I eventually did despite being warned by a friend and by the Website DVD Drive-in that the transfer left a lot ot be desired. Actually other than than being a widescreen version of the film this edition leaves everything to be desired. First off it it is at least 15 minutes too short running some 66 minutes. Worse still is the print itself which is as scratchy and as faded as one can get. Portions of the film seem to have lost all their color and have shifted to red. Its awful. This is possibly the worst edition of any film from Retromedia. I know its the worst version of this film out there since I have about four or five different dvd releases, none are as worn and faded as this one. I can not recommend this version of the film to anyone. If you want to see this really good film do try to get one of the other editions- any of the other editions.

ADDENDUM:
If you want a full (well missing a minute or 2) version of Seven Miracles see Ultimate Hero DVD by vintage. Its the full version letterboxed (plus Hercules Unchained in a beautiful print and Giant of Marathon in a good print)",1234396800,15,1522,4.28125
