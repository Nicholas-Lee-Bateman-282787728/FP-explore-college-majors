6446241,2,B00KTJ0PU2,"poorly acted, shot, and written. Good idea, poorly executed.",1451001600,,60,5.777777777777778
6446242,5,B00KTJ0PU2,Interesting independent movie. Acting was not the best but the movie was good and the message was very clear.,1451001600,,109,4.7894736842105265
6446243,1,B00KTJ0PU2,boring,1451001600,,6,6.0
6446244,3,B00KTJ0PU2,"The acting leaves something to be desired. It is really slow. I feel like there are a few bad puns throughout (""follow the star"" and the ""not so wise men""). The prime minister ends up having a Gollum moment with himself, which was laughable to be honest. I felt this short film had a great idea. It would be very interesting if Christ had been born in modern times. However, I feel the way it was portrayed could have been loads better.",1449532800,,436,4.329268292682927
6446245,4,B00KTJ0PU2,"I liked this a lot. It was a short movie but it had all of the details necessary to describe the birth of Jesus in our current times.  The acting was good.  This should be made into a full length movie with some better special effects, and I bet it would be very popular!",1441497600,,271,4.0
6446246,5,B00KTJ0PU2,Really enjoyed it.,1437523200,,18,5.333333333333333
6446247,3,B00KTJ0PU2,"It was okay, but I just think the updated idea of Jesus being born in modern times could have been presented better.",1435276800,,116,4.318181818181818
6446248,3,B00KTJ0PU2,"This movie starts out very simple, and the acting could be better, However, it gets more relevant each minute. It brings home how it must have been, every day people chosen to care for a special one. The Angels chosen to speak to Joe and Mary were particularly moving, modern and yet sacred. It's worth watching, just hang in there past the first ten minutes or so. Relevant for our times.",1430352000,,389,4.492957746478873
6446249,5,B00KTJ0PU2,Very well.,1426723200,,10,4.5
6446250,4,B00KTJ0PU2,A clever and engaging take on the nativity story. Shows what it might be like if Jesus were born in the 21st century.,1404345600,,117,4.130434782608695
8661416,5,B00KTJ0PU2,"Thoroughly enjoyed this modern day version of the birth of Jesus Christ.  The message is clear, and as others say the acting may not be the best but it does draw you in at the same time.",1518998400,,186,4.027027027027027
8661417,3,B00KTJ0PU2,"Just an ok movie. Not much from original story in the Scriptures. I have seen better. Always good to watch movies about our Lord, but low budgets don't do it for me.",1483228800,,165,4.1875
8661418,4,B00KTJ0PU2,"Well done modern adaptation. Could have been a bit better done, though.",1481587200,,71,5.0
8661419,3,B00KTJ0PU2,"This was a pleasant movie to watch. In an effort to maintain fidelity with the original nativity story, some scenes, while faithful to the original, do not figure as relevant, or necessary by today's standards (e.g. In this day and age, would it really be necessary to travel to your birthplace to register for a census?).",1454976000,,322,4.767857142857143
8661420,5,B00KTJ0PU2,"This film is as low-budget as they come--I couldn't even find it on IMDB--but it's a unique re-telling of the Nativity story, if Christ had been born in 21st-century Britain. The donkey, the star, the stable, the angels, the wise men, Herod, and the shepherds are all there, but not as you would expect! The Gospel message is clear. I'm definitely adding this one to my annual Christmas films.",1454630400,,393,4.7101449275362315
8661421,4,B00KTJ0PU2,"A modern twist on an old story.  Set in England, a modern couple shows how it could have happened if the Christ child's miraculous birth had happened in our times.  I felt they did a good job.  As a Christian sometimes I cringe at artistic license when retelling Bible stories.  But not this time!",1454544000,,297,4.444444444444445
8661422,2,B00KTJ0PU2,This movie looks like it was made by some college students fulfilling a class requirement.  The idea is ok but overall I had higher hopes.,1454457600,,138,4.52
8661423,1,B00KTJ0PU2,It was total crap!!!!! Why would anyone bother to make this story into a movie? What self-respecting actors would even agree to act in this movie? It was really bad.,1454284800,,165,4.533333333333333
8661424,5,B00KTJ0PU2,"I'm sure others could find the movie's portrayal as unimpressive, but I thought this was an inspired, excellent and creative presentation of the story of Christ's birth. I plan to buy a few copies and send them to our kids.",1453680000,,223,4.6
8661425,3,B00KTJ0PU2,It's a modern twist on what it would be like if the Savior was to be born in our day and age. It's okay....but I wouldn't care to see it again.,1453593600,,143,3.6451612903225805
