6787548,5,B00P4Q2ZO4,"Set in 1932 Ireland, we meet Jimmy Gralton. He has returned from enforced exile in the USA and returns to his home. Once there his old hall becomes a focus for the community who want to see it re-opened. Jimmy really wants to get on with an ordinary life, but he soon sees the benefits of a communal space where the community can come together to learn, laugh, dance and enjoy themselves.

Problem is that Jimmy is a socialist and as such soon gets the ire of the church in the shape of father Sheridan (Jim Norton you may remember him from `Father Ted') and the squire and the local fascists. You have to have a local branch I always feel of right wingers, but seriously this is conservative Ireland where repression was seen as next to Godliness - and the Church strictly enforced its doctrine over the community.

Things play out as the opposing sides inevitably cross one another's paths and the outcome is always in the balance. We also have the sub plot of the girl he left behind.

Ken Loach is a revered film maker and Paul Laverty is my favourite screen writer, he has been ably aided here by Donal O'Kelly (who wrote the play this film is based on). The hallmark direction from Loach is here which gives a free reign to the actors which ramps up the realism and gives it that documentary feel that works so well (think of `The Wind That Shakes the Barley' or `Land and Freedom'). As ever this is an absolute joy to watch, full of historical, social detail and dripping with political meaning and all based on a true story. One not just to recommend but one you will not want to miss.",1422748800,14,1593,4.393220338983051
6787549,4,B00P4Q2ZO4,"This is a period political docudrama, telling the story of Jimmy Gralton.

The film was directed by veteran Ken Loach, who has a track record of political dramas.

It's an engaging and well told true tale.

The ensemble cast is excellent, portraying the tensions of a divided and poverty stricken Ireland in 1932.

For anyone who is interested in this era of Irish history, Jimmy's Hall is compelling viewing.",1416960000,6,409,4.884057971014493

6787553,5,B00P4Q2ZO4,"Forget the Nightmare on Elms Street cinematic series, forget the billion Halloween films, forget all the ghoul and horror shows you might have seen in your time this film under review, Jimmys Hall, despite its placid sounding title is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Why? Well in this film about the deportation of revolutionary stand-up guy Jimmy Grafton from Ireland by the Irish Free State government in 1933 there are several vignettes where the local parish priest, make no mistake the local Roman Catholic parish priest, holds forth in various settings about the damn communists, damn jazz, damn dancing, damn sin, sanctified and to be mercilessly obeyed Mother Church (a.k.a. the Roman Catholic Church), and the waywardness of modern world in general. And throw in a couple of jabs at Joe Stalin and the Soviet Union to boot. The scariest scene? Scary evoking shutters in me from my long ago Roman Catholic Church childhood was when the good Father began to spout forth about the wickedness of..dancing and having fun in this wicked old world, naming the names of the damned who attended the dance in Jimmys hall in the process,  and not waiting like chaste boys and girls until the great by and by just like my old good Father did from his pulpit in my youth.

The battle between Mother Church represented by the good Father (the old codger) and Jimmy Grafton (played by Barry Ward), the local red leader and icon of the democratic free-thinking secular life is thus set early on. Set too around the controversy over reestablishing Jimmys hall as a cultural center, a converted barn on the Grafton property which had gone to ground when Jimmy had set sail for America after having been on the wrong side of the Irish Civil War. That wrong side of the Civil War meant that he was in opposition to accepting the British-backed Treaty which gave up the six counties in the North (todays Northern Ireland) and by the 1930s had established constitutionally the Roman Catholic Church as the state church and as the arbiter of morals and the parameters of social life. (That Civil war reflecting the part one time of troubles in the 1920s and not the latter ones of the late 1960s forward). So no question the issues were drawn rather shapely, the question of the North still thorny to this day despite the Peace Accords and the latter question of the power of the Church only recently broken a bit, broken most dramatically over the resounding victory vote on the question of same-sex marriage.

And like todays more secular and tolerant young Irish in Jimmy Graftons time it was the youth who had heard faraway rumors that it was okay to dance, to paint, to sing secular songs (in Irish too), to listen to decadent jazz, to cavort in the night, hell, to think who upon Jimmys return to Ireland to take care of his aging mother in the Great Depression-torn world clamored for him to reopen the cultural center. And he did. But Ireland then was in the grip of a great darkness after that Civil War had been won not by those who stood by the General Proclamation posted on the Dublin General Post Office wall proclaiming the fight for a democratic secular Ireland come Easter, 1916 but the Church and the larger landlords. Those opponents would first badger and then turn to violence and mayhem to stop Jimmys operation.

In this year of the 100th anniversary of Easter, 1916, the liberation struggle, this film rather graphically highlights what happens when the laboring people who fought for liberation when it counted don't win. Jimmy despite his best efforts, and of his mother when it came time for her to act, wound up being a non-person, a non-citizen since he held an American passport. Wound up being deported as an outside agitator and dying in exile in America in 1945. It took a long time to even get half of what Jimmy and his red circle were proposing back then and I am willing to bet six, two and even that there is still plenty of opposition in the old sod to conceding anything to modern life.

Oh yeah, there is as is almost inevitable a little romantic interplay (nice way to put it, right) between Jimmy and the now married girl he left behind, Oning, played by the fetching Simone Darby, but keep your eyes on the political struggle that is what gives this one five stars. And maybe close your eyes if you don't want to see that scary scene with the good Father pontificating from the pulpit. Okay.",1459728000,3,4434,4.657726692209451

6787571,5,B00P4Q2ZO4,"Jimmy's Hall is a fine follow up to Ken Loach's earlier film on the Irish Civil War, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". This movie deals with the aftermath of the Irish Civil War and the unresolved class conflicts that continued to disturb the seeming tranquility of rural Ireland in the 1930s. Well acted, well directed with a beautiful green setting and a lively eclectic soundtrack cleverly mixing Irish trad and then-contemporary jazz in the way it was likely actually blended in Jim Gralton's famous dance and education hall. I also really enjoyed the way Irish poetry--Yeats in particular--was brought into the story and recited touchingly by the characters. A fine movie, worth seeing again and again, about the Unfinished Revolution. Long Live Jim Gralton's Hall!",1452124800,,771,5.126984126984127

6787579,3,B00P4Q2ZO4,"""Jimmy's Hall"" (2014 release from Ireland/UK; 109 min.) brings the true story of what happened to Jimmy Gralton upon his return to Ireland in 1932. the movie's opening titles are accompanied by archive footage of New York in the late 20s/early 30s. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""County Leitrim, Ireland, 1932"", and we see Jimmy coming back to Ireland after 20 years in New York (presumably because of the Depression and related unemployment). It's not long before Jimmy and his friends decide to renovate the Pears-Connelly Hall, so as to give young people and the community a place to gather for dancing, reading, drawing, singing, etc. (we would call it a ""community rec center"" these days). This does not sit well withy the local priest, who claims 'exclusivity' for all things that could be deemed educational, nor are the local landlords pleased. At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie be legendary British director Ken Loach, now a crisp 79 years young (and similar to Woody Allen in his never-ceasing output). Loach is well-known for using his films as social commentary, and ""Jimmy's Hall"" is no exception. For me, that is not an issue, and Loach has made a number of stunningly beautiful and captivating movies over the years. Hence I was ready to like ""Jimmy's Hall"" very much. Alas, it was not to be, for several reasons: first, the movie is not very helpful to let us understand why certain factions take a particular position (we are never told what beef the landlords have with Jimmy and his friends) or why the issue of the land ownership matters initially, and then a bit later on it doesn't. But the biggest disappointment I have with the film is that at no point did I become emotionally invested in any of the main characters. Yes the local priest is easy to loathe, and we all do, but we are not given a chance to really buy in to Jimmy, or his friends, or his romantic interest. It all just happens, for seemingly no reason. If this was a fictional story, I'd have walked out an hour into the movie, but since this movie is ""inspired by the life and times of Jimmy Gralton"" (as is announced at the beginning of the movie), I wanted to find out how it would all unfold. There are some fine performances, but I found the chemistry between Jimmy (played by Barry Ward) and his romantic interest (played by Francis Magee) completely lacking and unconvincing. Last but certainly not least, there is a very nice musical score to the movie, featuring both traditional Irish music and jazz from the 20s and 30s.

I had seen the trailer for ""Jimmy's Hall"" a few times and was really looking forward to this. ""Jimmy's Hall"" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (I counted 12 people, including myself, of which one walked out halfway through and didn't come back). As much as I like Ken Loach, this is not none of his best, I'm afraid. But I certainly encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion about ""Jimmy's Hall"".",1440288000,7,3319,4.60472972972973
