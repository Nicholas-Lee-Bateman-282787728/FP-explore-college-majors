7385564,4,B0149GT13M,"We didn't purchase the DVD, but rented it from the library to test it out. I think we might be buying this one. My five year old daughter loves it and before watching this, has been loving the story of the Nutcracker for some time. This just seemed very fitting. Even though the animation isn't top notch, I still enjoyed the voice of Ed Asner, and am convinced that any movie he is in, can't be bad! Especially a Christmas one.",1451606400,,428,4.296296296296297
7385565,1,B0149GT13M,"Terrible on every front. Creepy eyes in all characters, dreadful animation, poor music, weird story line... there is nothing good about this DVD. Waste of my money and I will not be showing this to my kids again.",1451174400,,212,4.605263157894737

7385569,1,B0149GT13M,"This film is genuinely atrocious. The voice acting is awful, the animation is dated and odd (almost creepy), the storyline is a weak reinterpretation of the classic Nutcracker tale. Please, I beg of you, buy one of the many fine videos of the REAL Nutracker instead. This isn't worth your time and money.",1448755200,,304,4.754716981132075

8730112,1,B0149GT13M,"Had the misfortune of watching this last night after paying $3.99 to rent it on Amazon. It was awful!

The plot is really weird. It's fighting and warfare throughout, even in the Land of Sweets. The animation is really bad. And if Alicia Silverstone is actually the voice of Marie, she sure had me fooled. Marie speaks in a creepy falsetto and mostly makes girlish noises like, ""Aaaaah! Mmmmmm! Hmmmm? Teeheehee!""

Whoever has given this movie five stars is either a fake (paid?) person or has never seen a movie before.",1480723200,,520,4.7032967032967035
8730113,1,B0149GT13M,"I should've read the reviews first.  This is a confusing, creepy, unwatchable reimagining.  For some reason they took liberties with the music, modernized the language, and used stilted computer animation.  The 5 star reviews must be from the production company.",1480032000,,262,5.5
