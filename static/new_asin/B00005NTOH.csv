1637337,1,B00005NTOH,"From the articles I read in various magazines, I went into this movie knowing that it was going to be gross.  But I figured it'd be funny-gross, like Something About Mary or Austin Powers.  But alas, my hopes were squelched by Freddy Got Fingered.
The movie opens with Gord (Tom Green) leaving home to start a career at a cheese sandwich factory.  Secretly, he wants to go to Hollywood to become a cartoon animator.  When he's there, he gets turned down by the animation exec and is forced to return home.  Also thrown in is an absurd sub-plot in which Gord's abusive dad is accused of ""fingering Freddy,"" his younger brother.
The ridicules plot is just an excuse for Tom Green to run around screaming for an hour and a half, and act like a retard.  If we wanted that, we could've just watched three episodes of his TV show.  And how funny is it to watch him swing a newborn baby around a hospital room by the umbilical cord, while the Indian women in the bed opposite chant and bang on tambourines while getting splattered with blood?  That's not funny, it's borderline satanic.  And how funny is it to watch him lick his friend's protruding leg bone after a fall?  It's not, it's just stupid and gross, which basically sums up this whole movie.",988329600,12,1246,4.497777777777777

1637339,5,B00005NTOH,I laughed my head off when I went to see this.  This thing is the comedy movie of the year.  See this now.  By the end of this movie I had wet my pants and was rollin on the ground crying because it was so funny.  SEE THIS NOW!!!,987984000,,229,3.6122448979591835
1637340,1,B00005NTOH,"Perhaps, if you are a fan of Tom Green, you may enjoy this movie.  Perhaps.  I found this movie insanely disturbing.  It took the fears of hundreds of high-school grads and college dropouts...  Then had the nerve to laugh at them and make them look like mental cases.
This film's worst crime is that it tries to be about something.  Tom Green plays a general miscreant who, at 28, still lives at home, though he dreams of being an animator.  This premise could have been a showcase for Green's bizarre sense of humor, with him front and center.  Instead, the limelight is shared with his father, played by Rip Torn.  What results is ninety-plus minutes of arguing, with Green constantly mugging, and Torn constantly overacting.  Subplots are provided with Green's little brother Freddy, and his girlfriend.  Those, however, are respectively non-existant, and entirely cliched.
I can see where this film may have been a fascinating descent into an off-kilter mind.  With a much better script and the same premise, Green's twisted antics may have had some meaning.  That film is currently nowhere to be seen, though.
It could also have been a simple excuse, there merely to display Green to a wider audience, much like the ""Naked Gun"" movies.  Alas, that too is missing.  What we have is an alternately dull and disgusting film, which may leave many live-at-home artists with a worse self-image then when they went in.",987811200,14,1416,4.870292887029288
1637341,1,B00005NTOH,"As one pretentious reviewer said on the Netflix review site, this is an anti-comedy, which is a term hipsters use to justify ""intentionally bad comedy"".  While he used that as an excuse to recommend the film in one of the most pretentious reviews I've ever read on that site, I will say that this film is definitely anti-comedy.  It's also anti-funny and tremendously stupid.  Some friends of mine have insisted this film is sort of a modern day Bunuel film, which is insulting to Bunuel and to my intelligence.  Some have also written that it's an anti-comedy that is being deliberately bad, therefore that makes it good (the phrase those monkeys use is ""stupid comedy for smart people"").  It's definitely stupid, and rubs our face in it for 90 minutes.  It's simply an extension of Green's now defunct TV show, where he would put himself in situations and act like an insane prick for a few minutes (and at times get physically assaulted by the people he was harassing, which he richly deserved).  Every scene feels like it could have been in that TV show.  While that works (for some people) in a 3-4 minute format, seeing a movie for 90 minutes with Green screaming and screaming and screaming about it doesn't.  The TV show used to use live people in it, so their reactions were spontaneous.  In this movie, Green's fellow stars just look at him as if he's crazy.  Only Anthony Michael Hall (who appears at the beginning of the movie as the president of a cartoon company) gives a halfway decent performance.  Even the technical side of the film is flawed.  It's very uneven, and there are a lot of bad reaction shots, showing that Green doesn't know how to direct a picture.  This film also shows how out of touch Hollywood can be.  Green was ""hot"" back when this film was made.  He was really ""hip"".  But the rest of the country didn't think so, so when Hollywood unleashed this film on the public (his TV show was only on cable, which didn't reach a lot of people), they rejected him and, essentially, his career has been over since.  But Tom DID get to shag Drew Barrymore for a few years (she appears in the movie).  Uh, no.  This film really is the pits.  Embarrassing for all those involved.  The best thing about this movie is it killed Tom Green's career.",1505433600,,2269,4.550617283950618

As I write this review I keep laughing remembering some of the hilarious scenes... The number one son license plate; make your daddy proud; this is my home phone; I've changed my plans I'm giving up;.

But the laughs are there to support powerful uplifting messages - keep trying, don't get down on yourself etc.

Awesome movie. I believe many of the critics are doing a disservice by trashing this movie so viciously. The movie has the potential to provide many people with important inspirational insights that are delivered in a fun and unique way.

It is coming of age story which explores a Father and son relationship and makes use of the Disney formula but within that framework the movie stretches the boundaries and often crosses over them.

Warning, even though it is not real, its just a movie I suspect many people may find this movie offensive and distasteful even though the movie's messages are important ones.

Even though I can't stand the sight of blood and there are a few scenes with blood, I still loved this movie because I know how to close my eyes, ignore the bad and focus on the funny.

1637487,2,B00005NTOH,"From the title to the outtakes during the final credits, it is the product of a 28 year old who thinks he is 13!  It is a path that even Jerry Lewis deserted  in the '70s -- grossness for grossness' sake.  Steve Martin had shown how to do it with poignancy in The Jerk, South Park brilliantly week after week, but Green just intersperses what basically is a ""you loved my brother best"" father and son story (a la Tom and Dicky Smothers) with irrelevant gags designed to elicit roars of approval from beer-swilling, skirt-chasing collegians on Spring Break.  The gags are intended to make you gag while trying to cover your embarrassment at having even witnessed them with a laugh.  Yep, there is still an audience for Jackass (and money to be made) from this kind of humor, but is it something that producers and audiences should be proud of?  (And don't bring  up the hair-tonic bit in ""Something About Mary""-- it let the audience draw its own inferences about the situation.  If Green had done it, his line would be, ""Here, let me rub this cum into your hair ; it works just like the beauty parlor stuff you pay for."")",1364688000,,1120,4.482758620689655
1637488,3,B00005NTOH,"Out of every comedian and tv personality that has come and gone through the years, few managed to be so polarizing to audiences as Tom Green. His signature brand of weirdo, gross-out humor certainly doesn't conform to the general population's idea of what funny is, especially when its pushed to the furthest extreme imaginable as it is in Freddy Got Fingered.

For some background, Tom Green hosted his own show from 1994 to 1998 in Canada then moved to MTV sometime around 1999 and achieved what some might call fame. His show was successful because of its wacky content and hidden camera segments. Green won a cult following by acting like a total idiot out on the streets and filming the reactions of unknowing strangers. This reality style format served him well as it was a perfect showcase for his quick wit and zany personality.

This brings me to the overall issue plaguing Freddy Got Fingered, the fact that its a fictional film. Tom Green is not a good comedy actor, and he doesn't know how to write good jokes for movies. As a result there are jokes in the movie that are inspired by Tom Green's classic gross-out schtick, such as grabbing a horse's member, but the humor is lost because its scripted and not spontaneous. Tom Green didn't understand what made his brand of humor work, so to me the movie is almost something like a missed opportunity. The Jackass team did not make the same mistake when they made their movie. Instead of making it fictional they formatted it like a full length version of the show. Tom Green should've done the same.

That's not to say that the film is completely without humor. There are many funny moments in the film, mainly due to Green's awkward man-boyness and general wackiness when compared to his uptight parents. Rip Torn does a great job playing Tom's dad. He really gives everything into his performance and is willing to do things I honestly wouldn't have expected an actor of his caliber to do. It's definitely a unique role in his career.

Like most gross-out comedies the humor in this film is mostly immature and offensive. I personally am a fan of this type of humor, and Tom Green is definitely a master at it, but to be truthful his brand of comedy is not for everyone. I can understand why some people might not find the scene where Tom crawls inside a roadkill carcass in order to 'get inside' the mind of a deer.

If you're a fan of Tom Green, then obviously you're gonna like this movie. If you don't like Tom Green, then you're obviously not gonna like this movie. If you've never heard of Tom Green, go on youtube and look up some of the classic bits from his TV show. That should give you a good idea of whether to get this film or not.",1363478400,,2708,4.518367346938776

It's got the ending where they realize their dreams and he rents a helicopter to tell his girlfriend he loves her and gives her a bag of jewels (which are obviously made of plastic).  On one hand it's saying ""look, movies like this are just really stupid.""  And then at the same time it goes way over the top into insane stupidity.  The kind of movie where a scene will just start with Tom Green sitting in a living room playing a keyboard with sausages tied to ropes that are connected to a pully attached to his fingers so that when he plays the sausages bounce around in mid air.  You might find that obnoxious or funny.  I think you would really have to see the movie to know for yourself.  So, I wouldn't really recommend buying it first.

1637494,3,B00005NTOH,"What can I say about this movie except that it was something I distinctly remember from my childhood, for better or for worse. This movie came out back in all the way of 2001, I mustve  been 8 or 9 tops. When I was a kid I loved it, but seeing it as an adult makes me wonder what the hell I ever liked about it. It's definitely a dated movie and is definitely not as good as some people seem to think it is, I liked Tom Green but to be brutally honest his comedy is nothing special and if you compare it to the kind of stuff that's around nowadays it just becomes mediocre.

What I liked most about this movie were the characters, Tom does a good job as gord, and the people who play his brother and mom are also pretty good. His father is the absolute best and the conflicting chemistry between them does a good job of moving the story along. The girl who plays his paralyzed girlfriend is also pretty good, though I would have liked to have seen more of her. The comedy is the most conflicting thing about it for me, some of the jokes are genuinely funny but alot of it comes off as being forced and tries more to shock you or gross you out than to actually be funny.

Bottom line, the movie is OK, it's not bad but it's not too good either and it can be a little boring sometimes. I would say it's worth buying considering the low price and a good amount of special features, it's a fun movie but it's no work of comedic genius.",1355097600,,1431,4.067375886524823

People only hate it because Tom Green made it and they don't like him. I personally think he's a comedic genius. The fact that he was able to convince a major Hollywood studio to allow him include the scenes with him grabbing a horse's penis, swinging a bloody baby around, caning a handicapped girl, jerking off an elephant, etc. is pretty amazing. Yes these scenes are distasteful, but that was the whole point. He wanted to see what he could away with. The movie is called Freddy Got Fingered for crying out loud!

  If you're buying this movie for an intense crime drama where the wrong guy is accused, then for the most part you're wrong. That's not the primary meaning of the word ""fingered"" here. If that freaks you out, you should move on. But if you enjoy more risque humor once in awhile, and can laugh at an unfortunate series of events leading up to that point (told as a hazy backstory that gets clearer and clearer), then this movie is HILARIOUS!

1637511,5,B00005NTOH,"""Freddy Got Fingered"" is a misunderstood film about a father who doesn't respect his son & the son who eventually gains his fathers respect. The narrative is masked by politically incorrect pyrotechnics that were necessary to commit this work as being historically the most shockingly repulsive American made film. This film has little violence and a real life story. There are not any scenes of human hate or non consensual sex, no human torture or malice, just misunderstanding. American film goers can sit through scenes of people being disemboweled, shot to death and violently raped but when a man touches a penis of a horse we are shocked. If Tom Green were to grab the penis of a dog that would be less shocking only because sublimated penis envy is intolerable. The horse has an amazingly  huge cock and males are threatened & repulsed by that. The protagonist is also socially challenged and that is a disability which is also intolerable. But, take away all of the adornments and there is a simple narrative of a father who's traditional beliefs of a career undermine his relationship and respect for his son. The father being the antagonist has disdain towards art as a career therefore overlooking his son's creative talents which reach far beyond animation but also include a knack for humorous writing. The son goes through a social ritual of fire and proves to his father his worthiness. The story is one of which 99 percent of fathers and son's share today and throughout history as well as in Shakespearean drama. So, dog this film if you want to but we all live the story and this one at least has a happy ending! By Craig Barr.",1294876800,3,1646,4.735191637630662

There were moments of clarity and genuine sincerity in films like Glitter and Gigli, as well as those films of Ed Wood. Freddy Got Fingered offered a few sensitive moments by Julie Hagerty (a devoted mom) and Eddie Kaye Thomas (an abused sibling, but not what you think). Otherwise, Tom Green's ego trip as star, writer & director has little to offer, esecially in the ""laffs"" department. I enjoy clever, crude scenarios (Airplane!, anyone?). This film is no Airplane! or even American Pie. A few references to Green's penchant for creative behavior might've been better than the long, drawn-out gross-out set pieces. Drew Barrymore (his squeeze at the time) and the great Rip Torn reached new lows, though you can't say they didn't take their roles to the max. And that's the problem...Green's excess simply wasn't funny or clever. I thought the title was a metaphor but there's a suggestion that Freddy really did get...well, you know.

And the movie gets really nasty and incomprehensible from here.

But Tom Green showed his kind what being gross is all aboot, and he outdid it in the most rancid, loud, offensive, and indecent way possible.  And I had to suffer as the consequence, yet for such a beatdown I'm about to give ""Freddy Got Fingered"", there was sadly a time that I once like Tom Green's mental antics.  It was the days that I thought wearing a red NY cap backwards was cool, so it's easy to see how easy I was to laugh at anything ""The Tom Green Show"" had to offer, even his cancer special and ""Bum Bum"" song. He can be a pretty amusing guy under firm restraints, not to push the FCC limits but still be wild enough to chalk at anything.  Watching him take the director's seat on a feature-length film proves that some things are best left restricted.

Whenever he's not causing harm towards others and express motions in a retarded gesture, he's making conflict with his vindictive father (Rip Torn) whether by simply TOMfoolery in the bathroom or making sausages tied to a piano. I wanted to sympathize with the father, but he can be just as rude and abrasive as his son, and what's bizarre, he can easily forgive Tom for everything he destroys just for him having a job; their relationship is so destructive and uncanny, they make Bam Margera and his father look like Mormons.

Tom's character's actions are uncalled for.  The monstrosity 'handles' objects from horses and elephants, threatened to use the gun on himself, cut up a deer's carcass and wear it as a disguise only to be hit by truck (and survive, sadly enough), and chewed up an umbilical cord like spaghetti and used the newborn baby as a lasso.  He's not only crazy, he's dangerous.  He's a disturbed human being that needs to be psychologically evaluated and be lobotomized, certainly not from the people in this movie.  The side characters seem to be in their own little world, either not acknowledging his behavior or tolerating it: he has best friend he abused yet the friend's still with him, he manage to get a wheelchair-bound woman with a strange masochistic attitude who supported him, his mother doesn't understand reason, and an family psychologist believed a psycho like Tom and thought the father was a molester.  I am utterly flabbergasted at how inane these people are, just letting the maniac go crazy with anything he touches.

I cannot stand the jokes in this movie, their vulgarity is matched by how irrelevant they are.  There's no meaning for him acting so immature and repulsive, and he can go too far with his material.  Specially it's the child abuse jokes that tear my funny bone into two: there's a recurrence where a nice suburban kid gets physical hit whenever Tom is around.

In fact, ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is entirely sick.  This is an insult to even controversial comedy, because even certain controversial shows and movies make a point.

1637528,1,B00005NTOH,"It is for good reason that the ""Chicago Sun Times"" called this film ""a vomitorium."" ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is the most tasteless movie I have ever seen. I thought about giving this film two stars, as a couple of bright spots do present themselves underneath the films execrable veneer, but on balance I couldn't bring myself to do it. The film centers around Tom Green's desire to become an animator in Los Angeles, and his conflicts with his father, Rip Torn. Torn and Anthony Michael Hall provide most of the (few) laughs to be had, although there were three other brief bright points in the film. The animation called ""Zebras in America"" was stupid yet amusing (""Listen To My Hooves!""); I will never think of half human-half zebra mythical animals the same way again. The sausage organ scene is one of the most musically odious performances I have ever seen, yet Green's singing made it worthwhile as a touchstone for horrible film scores. Finally, the surprise trip to Pakistan for Green and Torn was a quirky and unexpected turn of events. Torn and Hall are the highlights of the film, as their straight man reaction shots are as good as acting can get in this mess. That's pretty much the good. The bad is much, much more extensive.

The film wallows in adolescent self-indulgence, and serves as nothing more than a shock vehicle for Green. While this is no surprise, the depths to which he will plunge (the ""New York Times"" called him an ""artist"" for making this film...) is an unwelcome surprise. I certainly could have done without the baby delivery scene (it's worse than you can possible imagine), I never needed to see Rip Torn's rear end in a provocative dance scene, nor did I need the extremely adolescent phallic obsessions manifested with both a horse and an elephant. Just when you think it couldn't possibly get worse Julie Hagerty (What was she thinking?), Green's mother, turns up in bed with Shaquille O'Neal. I was especially unamused with the handicapped girlfriend, Marisa Coughlan (somehow this movie failed to catapult her to stardom) and her ventures as an ""amateur rocket scientist,"" although that was by far not the most annoying aspect of her character, which I suspect was developed strictly from Green's oversized ego. You'll understand when you see the film, believe me: the world ""subtlety"" does not exist in Tom Green's vocabulary.

The DVD features numerous extras, but the real question is, will you be able to stand watching them? The only one worth anything is Rip Torn's scene-specific commentary track. Tom Green's approach to commentary tracks is stylistically similar to Ray Dennis Steckler's, the exception being that Steckler provides useful information and insight along with narration. Green merely likes to hear himself talk, and provokes the audience to like him even less (if that's possible). There is a track of the audience reaction at the premiere, which is a novel innovation. It's pretty boring in practice, though, as you hear laughs here and there, and a lot of groans at mayhem involving Green with roadkill, Green treating an open leg wound, Green delivering a baby, and green massaging various large mammals in an impure manner.

Yes, it's sick humor.  No, it's not for everyone.  But this IS Tom Green!  I can't imagine what some of the people who reviewed this movie were expecting - Citizen Kane?  C'MON PEOPLE!

Letting him direct this film, I can't imagine what people thought they'd see?

If lowbrow humor, sight gags and gross out scenes make you chuckle, this film is for you.  Also, great acting, as usual, from Rip Torn - he's hysterical.

Just remind yourself it's a Tom Green vehicle, and you're only watching it for the lowbrow humor, you'll be fine.  If you sit down to watch a major movie production, yes, you'll be disappointed but I don't think that was even close to the aim of this movie.

1637541,3,B00005NTOH,"I remember not being impressed seeing 'Freddy Got Fingered' back in 2001 when it was released in theatres - now close to a half-decade ago - but I also remember thinking ""that wasn't NEARLY as bad as all those reviewers said it was"". That opinion pretty much held up the other night, when I watched it for the first time since that initial viewing.

Without any question in my mind, the real reason to see 'Freddy' is for Rip Torn's performance as Green's father. His comedic expressions are, literally, gold, and being the realistic, angry counter-force to Green's manically cartoonish imbecile makes his emotional clouds of rage that much more hilarious. For example, Green is in the shower, unknowingly in scuba gear to his father. Like most of the events in the film, it begins with Torn playing it sincere, as if the situation were normal. In this particular scene he kindly jokes around, doing some trick to make the water in the shower hot to play with Green. When there is no reaction by Green, it quickly cuts to a brilliant shot of Torn seethingly kicking open the door to the bathroom. He then opens the shower, and sees Green in the scuba gear. His basic reaction to situations like this are almost always the same, but Torn plays them so perfectly, with hysterical nuance, that the scheme never gets old. Again, by playing the ""what the $*#@ are you doing?"" contrast to the absurdity of Green makes the situations that much funnier, and Green knows this as a director, and edits those particular scenes wonderfully, which presents some of the most funny, original comedic scenes I've seen in recent years. And, despite Torn's talented subtleties, they play off the situations to the most extreme effect; in the scuba scene, when Torn asks Green what the *%#)@ he's doing, Green gives him some moronic line about the soap being a treasure. Contrasting this absurd behavior, then, is Torn, who violently, ruthlessly throws Green out of the shower on to the floor, breaking the glass of the shower entirely. I think this dynamic works so well because Torn is one of those old-fashioned guys, impulsive and ready to act on his heated emotions, so naturally he abuses Green in a way that most of us are too passive-aggressive to go about doing.

Probably the other most successful element of the film, for me, is the musical score. It's basically one simple theme, awesomely satirical in its overt melodrama, that takes advantage of the underlying, ridiculous film it's paired up with. Somehow, it just gels the whole thing together, and in my opinion, gives a lot of the film's bits a sense of humor that they'd lack had its presence been missing.

Overall, though, the movie isn't anything truly special, and while I really do believe it's got moments of genius, there are just as many scenes that flop. Yet, I must say not once did I find myself bored or distracted, and I think that's because the sheer distinctness of 'Freddy' is utterly refreshing when such Hollywood RUBBISH, most which have the balls to call themselves 'comedies', are thrown at us.

That does not mean there are not some creative gags and scenes. Its just that they do not hold together too well. It is, all things considered, disappointing.

The story, such as it is, involves a son in his later 20s who is still living at home, much to the disgust of his father. The son wants to be a cartoonist and sets off for Hollywood in search of his big break. While doing so, he has trouble holding down any job at all and runs back home for support. This is in contrast to Freddy, the ""good"" son. The ""bad"" son just seems to have a talent to make a good situation bad through his lies, deceit and schemes. The worst of these is when he accuses his father of ""fingering"" his brother Freddy and thereby gets all of the social work types inflamed. That both parties, including the adult son, deny that any molestation took place is beside the point. The only ones really molested in this film are a horse, an elephant and the viewers.

It's not a new idea, Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean character is an obvious reference point, and like that character Gord displays an ignorance of social etiquette and ordinary everyday things, but Tom Green proves himself the master of his craft with this film, taking the cutesy obliviousness of Mr Bean to a level of sociopathic insanity that opens up a wider range of comedic possibilities. Whatever critics might say this movie lacks, none have disputed the width of the variety of ridiculous behaviour it contains.

What's most upsetting about this film is that there are some good performers in it who were totally wasted, such as Rip Torn and Julie Haggerty.  I can't imagine why either one of them would sign on to make a mess like this.

And worst of all, Tom Green insults his audience with gross-out toilet humor, masturbation, and oral sex scenes that are tasteless and unfunny.

I bet the CIA use this to get information out of suspected terrorists. They should ban this movie for being so flippin' bad. Here's why:

The acting is horrible (especially Tom Green), Tom Green's directing is the worst out there, the humour is as funny as Tom Green (so that's pretty horrible.), and the soundtrack is shocking.

Now that I've gotten THAT out of the way, I'll review the film itself.

Most movies considered ""cult films"" failed to achieve mainstream success upon original theatrical release, often grossing more money in video rentals and sales than in theater tickets. In most cases (but by no means all), the film hardly makes an impression with the general public and critics are often apathetic as well. However, a small, devoted group of viewers, often ""film buffs"" or film students, show an extreme appreciation of the film.

Tom Green has really outdone himself with this masterpiece of cinematic art,never in all the history of movie making has any actor/writer even come close with creating a movie so disturbingly crude and yet equally amusing at the same time. The Farrely brothers must be biting their lips in envy at Tom Green, for even they could not have created a movie as over the top as Freddy Got Fingered, and believe me labeling this movie ""over the top"" is an understatement of the highest degree. Anyway, to make a long story short...GO SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS! At least Tom tried, that's all that can be said.

Its really obvious why someone wouldn't like this movie, it's in bad taste and the plot is all over the place and ridiculous, which is one of the reasons its so funny.

Please don't watch this movie expecting a typical hollywood comedy or you will hate it.  THis movie is more like a series of loosely held together over the top gross-out sketches that are held together with a running sarcastic theme of teen angst and nobody understanding you.

But even on an elephant-semen-spewing,umbilical-baby-swinging level, this movie didn't even deliver the ""offense to mankind"" sort of value that critics had promised. It's just another flat waste of time, interminable and boring.

Fans of Tom Green's shark-attack humor probably won't find anything to enjoy here either. The raunchy bits are utterly lacking in context (WHY exactly does Gord start yelling and peel of the road to (...)masturbate a horse? For that matter, why does he stop?). His delivery is all wrong, as if the contraints of his own screenplay and direction wrung the humor from him.

His physical comedy is spastic and random and go and on. He fumbles around with humor like an orangutang with a bra-strap. Rip Torn as Green's father is equally inept.

  For a screenplay that has little contextual humor, delivery is everything, and the performers are tone-deaf. Consider the scene where Rip Torn drunkenly bares his arse and invites Gord (Green) to ""f*ck your daddy."" That's the driving comedic force behind this bit. I wonder if Green wrote the screenplay as an act of comedic procrastination, thinking ""we figure out how to make this scene funny while we do it."" As if humor was special effects.

Bad as it was, I had a hard time abhorring this. I was ready to be offended by the baby swinging scene, but was instead just bored. There's an ongoing gag about an accident-prone little boy that's handled too graphically to be funny and ends up being uncomfortable, but that's about it.

No, It's not worse than TOMCATS. But an offense to humanity? The horror of licking an exposed bone wound is far more impressive on paper than in the film.",1114387200,9,1876,4.822429906542056

I think the critics missed the point on this one...it was intended to be marvellously stupid. Nothing made me happier to find that Tom Green was still hitting the mark in my books. Basically a story of a lazy, good-for-nothing kid trying to make a living as a cartoonist while simultaneously trying to live up to his dad's expectations is about the only way to describe this flick. From there it just descends into an anarchic free for all whose only intention is too make you laugh at the absurdity of it's premise. Watch as Tom helps a woman give birth and commence to bite the umbilical cord and swing the baby by the same cord to bring it to life. See Tom bring a lady to climax by wacking on her paralyzed legs with bamboo. Observe as Tom scuba dives in his shower. Laugh as his younger neighbour always gets in the path of flying objects. Somehow, Mr. Green ties all this together into some barely cohesive story. I just laughed harder and harder as the film progressed. He continually tops himself with every scene. Rip Torn is awesome as his abusive, taunting, world-weary father. Rip was always awesome on 'The Larry Sanders Show', and this movies further cements his greatness in my mind. Anthony Michael Hall is nearly unrecognizable as a slick producer at some nameless cartoon company. It's nice to see him working again. I can't put into words how absurd and ridiculous this flick is. When Tom licks the bone jutting from his best friend's shin, I screamed in delight. When Tom freaks out on a fake cell phone in a restaurant, firing the fake person on the other line for costing him 'forty million deutschmarks' I giggled uproarously. When Tom tells his mom to leave his father and pursue sex encounters with basketball players and Greek men, I nearly died. When he fondles a stud horse, I did die and go to heaven. I've given away quite a bit, but believe me, when you see it, you will STILL laugh! I wish every Hollywood comedy was this good! I hate the generic crime film within a comedy scenario. This is what filmmaking is about. The critics just lambasted it, but that's only because they're jealous that someone gave Mr. Green the money to make a movie like this, while they just continue to write reviews nobody reads.

1637579,1,B00005NTOH,"The king of obnoxious behavior, Tom Green, has made it no secret that he finds a great deal of humor in ticking off those who don't understand his brand of comedy. You don't have to be an uptight film critic to find his starring role in ""Freddy Got Fingered"" to be one of the most annoying experiences in movie history. I guess that this is a type of ""ironic brilliance"" but in all honesty, that's about the only thing you'll probably find funny with this mess of a movie. While his MTV television show had its share of funny moments back in the day, Tom Green should have left the acting (as well as directing) to people who can actually do it. Green is more or less playing the same fauxly-oblivious chucklehead that he does whenever he makes public appearances. He tortures Rip Torn (as well as his audience) for a full hour and a half with his tounge-in-cheek child's play.

This is relevant only because Tom Green is himself a creative genius, and this is a movie made for the pallet of creative geniuses.
It is not at all difficult to understand why so many people despise this film. If you are not extremely intelligent this movie will only confuse and anger you. Likewise, if you are highly intelligent but are not creatively oriented you will look down your nose at this film as an immature romp, having completely missed the humor and the point.
In this film Tom Green, for the first time in the history of cinema, NAILS the experience of being a creative genius in the presence of average, normal individuals.
His manic exploits, percieved by many to be immature gross-out humor, perfectly convey the contempt the creative genius has, not for the people around him, but for every maddeningly rediculous irrational thing the people around him think and believe.
Tom Green is breaking new ground in the arena of High Contempt in every scene, even thrashing the legs of his handicapped girlfriend with a cane and wallowing in the carcass of a road-kill deer in order to needle those who don't get the joke, and to act out his own deep seeded resentment for all things proper.

If you've followed Tom's career, you know that he's been doing outrageously shocking things from day one...even before MTV brought him over to the U.S.A. He was once kicked off a Canadian Late Night Show for shaving a dead raccoon. You have to understand that Tom started as a CULT , he didn't just tap-dance into the mainstream like the latest teen-star. His insane humor never was meant for the mainstream. America wanted Tom, and they got him!

Most people, when given their first opportunity to make a Hollywood movie, write something to PLEASE the audience, even if it means CHANGING who they are to do it. Tom didn't change himself for NOBODY! He knew that his pop-cultured-fad fans were expecting something along the lines of ""Road Trip"" or ""American Pie"" so he went OVER THE LINE....HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HOLLYWOOD!...HE DID SOMETHING FOR HIS TRUE FANS!

Tom knew that this movie would flop, he didn't even try to make it good. The real joke is on Hollywood and the stupid main-streamers who have no idea how much integrity Tom Green has.",1085097600,26,1090,4.726315789473684

1637593,4,B00005NTOH,"""American Pie 2"" deserved to be hammered the way this film was by the critics. ""Van Wilder"" did, as well. These were half-hearted, lame attempts at gross-out comedy, retreading the same idiotic ground as seemingly hundreds of movies before them. These shamelessly pandered to their braindead teenage audience to get laughs for, amongst other things, a dog's shrinking testes. Ha. Ha.
This, though, is a review of ""Freddy Got Fingered."" So let's begin. In order to understand whether a movie is successful, it's important to take its goals into consideration. The point of this movie was, obviously, to push boundaries and be outrageously funny, and, yes, gross. It was an actually disgusting gross-out comedy, something that rarely gets made. So it was unfair for whoever reviewed this to expect anything else. When one gives the movie a fair shake and watches it with said goals in mind, it's actually very good and funny. The plot is more engrossing and quirky than most cookie-cutter comedies, in addition to serving as a springboard for Tom Green's comic mayhem, which is admittedly hit-or-miss here, (I could have done without seeing him run around a highway with a deer's carcas draped on his back before getting hit by a truck)but does hit most of the time. The supporting cast also turns in great performances, especially Rip Torn as his one-note, constantly angry father. Most of the good gags are too profane to mention here, but if you are ready for an extreme experience and are open-minded, this just may be for you.",1070755200,5,1529,4.930232558139535

Tom Green is a comedic enigma, part Jim Carrey, part Adam Sandler, All spontaneous combustibility, just waiting to cause an explosion of laughter.
There really is no plot. No, I'm serious, Tom Green managed to slap 87 minutes of film together with virtually nothing holding the damn thing up. That non-sense about Gord (Green's character) aspiring to become an animator is basically a smoke screen to blind the audience from the fact that movie exists simply to make the grossest, most ribald comedy since, well, EVER!!!!
I can't believe that people thought this movie was such a hunk of comedic blasphemy. Yes, it is gross, nasty, vulger, tasteless, and utterly, utterly childish, but it's a funny movie, not despite all this, but because of it. Good old Roger Ebert described it as ""a vomitorium consisting of 93 mins. of Tom Green doing things a geek in a sideshow would turn down."" I couldn't agree with that statement more. Tom Green has a alot of foul language to get out of his system, he humps a Chinese man in a public bank, he licks a open wound, he canes his his Masachist girlfriend, he tapes an umbilical cord on his belly, and so on, and so on, and so on.......
BUT, the movie is still hilarious, maybe because there's a part of each and every one of us that wishes we could publically misbehave to this degree and get away with it. The movie is completely empty of brains, but it's everyone's chilhood fantasy. It may go down in history as the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE of comedy, but Green is clearly not ashamed of this. God help me, I just laughed so hard. I recommend this film to you on the simple level of stupid comedy. Comedy can be funny when it's mesmorizingly stupid, and if you doubt this at all, FREDDY GOT FINGERED is your movie, jack.
Oh, and just why is the film called FREDDY GOT FINGERED. Well, the most juvenile joke involves Green accusing his father of molesting his 25-year old brother, Freddy. But then, weren't you expecting that?",1055203200,3,2194,4.542929292929293

I am absolutely baffled, not to mention appalled, at the large number of people who actually like this (edited for inappropriate language) and giving it favorable reviews. This is a testament to just how mentally arrested much of society seems to have become in recent years in terms of taste for entertainment. There are many extremely disturbing and horrifying scenes that just completely destroy all of the worthiness of this abominable film. To put it plain and simple, there isn't even an atom of redeeming value anywhere on here. All of us have plenty of freak in ourselves. ""FGF"" has none of that. This movie is just plain sick, perverted, and stupid to a dangerous level.
How is it funny when a stillborn is spun around in the air with an umbilical cord in a hospital room and then given back to the mother and laughing about it?! How is it supposed to be funny seeing animal (gratification) funny?! How is any of this funny? Anyone with even a small piece of brain tissue would be smart enough to not even find this remotely funny. I would've even go far enough as to say that this is racist and bigoted!
There are plenty of dumb movies out there that can still be plenty of fun and humorous without necessarily being intelligent. ""Freddy Got Fingered"" does not fall into either category. In fact, I am absolutely confused that this hasn't gotten an NC-17 rating as the content that is prevalent throughout warrants this being that rating and far more than an R rated flick. This should've even been categorized in the adult movie section at a run down video store. I would even go the distance to say that it almost seems to be more like illegal video material that would get one in major trouble with the law.
Don't even bother to rent this cinematic garbage. There isn't anything shocking about it at all. It's just an embarrassing and ignominious piece of garbage that just simply should be taken off the market altogether. It will do nothing but indelibly leave negatively disturbing images in your mind and leave bad mental scars for many years to come. Thankfully though, I managed to psychologically recover from the scars of this wretched movie and rebound a strong person. It's a shame that Green hasn't done the same. He is like 25 years too old to be acting like a leprechaun with rabies. This is the bottom of the barrel in moviemaking and is nothing but complete (edited for inappropriate language) that should never have even been put into existence!

After watching the Toxic Avenger, I never thought another movie could top it as far as shock value and twisted humor goes. Freddy Got Fingered far surpasses Toxic Avenger in all departments except for gore.  Tom Green's insane bits and stunts naturally get the most attention, but they also sort of overshadow the more tame, but equally funny scenes (e.g., ""Where's your LeBaron Freddy?"").

This movie was absolutely terrible but I never laughed once but God did it test my patience! I never liked Tom Green and gave a sour face when someone called him a ""genius"". Still when I saw the rather kind Ebert slap a 0 star on Freddy Got Fingered I knew I had to see what was so terrible. And I discovered, much to my dismay, that there was a lot. Somehow Green has the idea that animal bodily fluids (especially feces) are the funniest things on earth. And, for some reason, anytime someone swears, Green expects us to laugh ourselves silly. Like having a sweet PREGNANT woman screaming vulgarities at the top of her lungs. Ha ha ha. Isn't that a knee slapper? Oh and there is a running gag with a kid suffering terrible injuries throughout the movie. Let me be blunt, if you like this movie you have no class. Period.

To start with, I am, for the most part, a fan of Tom Green.  His material is stupid and designed to shock, but it is legitimately funny.  Why?  Simply for the shock factor.  He is funny because people have no idea who he is and what is happening to them.  He is funny based on the unscripted reactions that he gets.
This is where this movie goes horribly wrong.  Tom Green cannot be funny in this setting.  He is doing the same stuff, but without that reaction it is nothing.  It goes from comedy to a man shaking a horse penis for no reason.  I cannot say that I didn't find some things funny, but those things lasted about 5 minutes total.  The rest was downright awful, and desperate.  ""Look at me shake a horse penis, hahahaha, laugh you.... LAUGH!""  No, this doesn't work.
Tom Green could have made something like his ""Japanese (I forget the rest of the name) Special.""  That was funny.  Scripted Tom Green, however, just doesn't work.

What I did like...was Tom's courage to make the movie. If you've followed Tom's career, you know that he's been doing outrageously shocking things from day one...even before MTV brought him over to the U.S.A. He was once kicked off a Canadian Late Night Show for shaving a dead racoon. You have to understand that Tom started as a CULT , he didn't just tap-dance into the mainstream like the latest teen-idol. His insane humor never was meant for the mainstream. America wanted Tom, and they got him!
Most people, when given their first opportunity to make a Hollywood movie, write something to PLEASE the audience, even if it means CHANGING who they are to do it. Tom didn't change himself for NOBODY! He knew that his pop-cultured-fad fans were expecting something along the lines of ""Road Trip"" or ""American Pie"" so he went OVER THE LINE, BABY!....HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HOLLYWOOD!.....HE DID SOMETHING FOR HIS TRUE FANS!
Tom knew that this movie would flop, he didn't even try to make it good. The real joke is on Hollywood and the stupid main-streamers who have no idea how much integrity Tom Green has.",1029369600,3,1259,4.675675675675675

Like Jeremy Irons in D&D. This even beat out Little Nicky for just plain stupidity without a point.

I, personally think it is absolutely the funniest thing I've ever seen, but some people think Tom Green's sick humor is too much.  Now, he can be a little ridiculous at times, but this movie was simply great.  I mean come on, someone running around a forest road screeming and wearing a dead deer on their back while cute little forest animals spectate nearby and children's music plays in the background, and then to have him plowed by a speeding eighteen wheeler and go scraping across the ground at 60 mph?  HOW IS THAT NOT FUNNY? Fans of the Tom Green Show will treasure this movie.  The exaggerated situations and the spontaneous ridicule at unpredictable places just made the movie.  I mean, it's just the kind of movie I'm looking for, nothing but comedy, from the beginning to the end.  I must have rewound most scenes of the movie about fifty times each because they were so funny.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

I was expecting Green to do stupid and sick stuff.  I also expected that I would at least enjoy it enough to laugh.  And I did.
The plot...not that great.  The story.....not that great.  But, that's okay.  Hey, for being a first time director, Tom doesn't do a bad job.  There are hillarious moments in this movie.  Tom, of course, is hillarious.  Rip Torn is also very funny and underappreciated in this film.
The DVD isn't too bad either.  Not at all.  Tons of special features.  I like the one that allows you to hear the audiance laugh along as you watch the movie.  Just like being at the theatres.  Outtakes and deleted scenes are hillarious.
I did like this movie.  It's not one that I will watch over and over again.  It's not one that I'm going to say is ""brilliant"" or ""spectacular.""  But the movie did it's job.  It made me laugh.

just want to tear your gaze away from the screen. That's what sitting through this horrible monstrosity is like. I love Tom Green on MTV.Weither he's torturing his parents,french kissing a cow's severed head or swimming across Lake Washington. Part of the hilarity of the show is that,like Andy Kaufman,he gets hilarious, real gut reactions from the general public whom he's pulling the pranks on. But his brand of humour doesn't translate to movies at all. Freddy Got Fingered will test the  patience of the most ardent Tom Green fan.
The movie has a decent cast who all make complete fools of themselves;Rip Torn,Drew Barrymoore,the lady from Airplane and What About Bob?,Finch from American Pie and the dude who played the hitchhiker in Something About Mary and the piss drinking cop in Dumb & Dumber(even he looks sane next to Tom).But all the atrocious things in the movie can be attributed to Tom. He goes
completely overbroad in his love of grossout comedy;horses with erections,giving an elephant a handjob,child molestation,a small boy is torn to shreads by an airplane's propaller,skinning the carcuss of a dead moose and then wearing it. But,by far the worst, most horrible and disgusting scene in the film is when he delivers a baby in his own inimitable way. Blood is splattered everywhere and then he bites the umbilical chord off with his teeth. That was not funny. It was as gross and unpleasant as anything I've ever seen  in any horror film.

Both explored the effect this estrangement had on their personal relationships, Green's character suffering an even more spectacular case of 'false self syndrome' than Rylance in 'Intimacy'. Both films were funny. Both tackled the issue of sex head on. Both ended with an exchange of bodily fluids, ironically more explicit in Green's film. But out of the two only Green's film really tackles it from an original left field perspective. I suspect there are a lot of wannabe's out there still living at home who were made uncomfortable by Green's mirror. So they looked away and blamed the comedy. It's not classic but there are belly laughs. It's just some of the material inbetween that makes you go ""what?"" Alarmingly, the line between what happens to people in the film and what happens in reality is paper thin.

1637657,5,B00005NTOH,"' Freddy Got Fingered ' is a moving, often touching character piece about the love/hate relationship that exists between fathers and sons. Gordie ( Tom Green ) is an unmotivated 28 yr. old, still residing at home. His father ( Rip Torn ) wants his oldest son to be a success, to ' Make Daddy proud '. When Gordie is unable to live up to his father's rather high expectations, his father shows his dark side, and the conflict becomes intense. In one particular scene, Gordie, at a nice restaurant with his new lady friend, is confronted by his father, who happens to be dining there as well. Gordie's father is most unhappy to find out that Gordie is putting on a charade for his girlfriend, wearing Dad's suit and pretending to be an important businessman. Gordie is in fact jobless, and his father exposes his ruse. What follows is a tense, breathtaking scene, a seminal moment for father/son. Powerful stuff. Gordie eventually learns to become more responsible, and in the finale, father and son share a bonding experience that is life-changing for the both. A stunning, hypnotic character study in the spirit of ' American Beauty ' and ' In The Bedroom ', ' Freddy Got Fingered ' is a landmark film that will stay with you forever.

1637658,2,B00005NTOH,"""Freddy Got Fingered"" follows Tom Green's animator, who seeks fame in Hollywood, but being rejected, comes back to his home .... blah, blah, blah.  It's pointless to follow the story.  It's Tom Green that you see.  In case you don't know him, or you can only remember him as 'Chad' in ""Charlie's Angels,' I just write down what you'll see in this movie.
1) Tom Green skateboarding.
2) Tom Green ""getting inside"" of an animal.
3) Tom Green doing ""backward man"" wearing his dad's suit backward, and walking backward.
4) Tom Green bashing the legs of his girlfriend in a wheelchair (because she wants to get orgasm).
5) Tom Green brandishing a new-born baby holding a umbilical code.
6) Rip Torn letting his pants down.
7) Lovely Drew Barrymore's cameo appearance, and very brief moment revealing her personality (Watch until the end of credits).
8) Not so funny animation ""Zebras in America"" for which the characters pay one million dollars.
Those are just part of the gags Tom Green shows, and much gross-out scenes are deliberately omitted here.  Well, that's about a horse and an elephant ... but no need to tell you about it.
Seriously, some might find the film funny, but I didn't happen to feel that way.  It's not offensive; it is gross-out, but that's not the problem (I love still Cameron Diaz's hairstyle in ""There's Somthing About Mary."")  No, it's just unfunny.  Perhaps his comic turns would work within shorter minutes, like 5 minute sketches you can see on TV, but Tom Green stretches the film too long so that we sense it's all repetition of his crazy mannerism.  This film reminds me of Adam Sandler, who succeeded in ""The Wedding Singer"" but failed in ""Little Nicky.""  To sustain 90 minutes, we have to have something more than short sketches.
""Freddy Got Fingered"" earned 5 Razzies, and that's something, you know, but the film itself is, I think, rather tepid as a whole in spite of some outrageous gags.  But I cannot possibly hate Tom Green, who showed up himself at the ceremony of Golden Raspberry Awards to collect 5 gold-painted trophies, and for that I give another star.  Well, I like you and your shows, Tom.  Really.",1017273600,2,2144,4.733870967741935
1637659,1,B00005NTOH,"...I'm still trying to grasp what I just saw! This movie makes absolutely no sense what so ever! From time to time I used to watch the Tom Green show on MTV. There were times when I laughed my butt off and there were times where my head was spinning from the demented, twisted skits that just passed before my eyes. Tom Green is the type of guy that dresses like a court jester and entertains you...and just when you start to laugh at his childish, nonsensical antics, he slams you in the back of the head with a sledgehammer. At least on MTV, his skits were kept to a few minutes a piece within a 30-minute time slot. That is the forum that is best suited for him! It allows him some freedom, while maintaining some control. That's the problem that plagues this movie. It is 87 minutes of those bizarre gags thrown on top of a movie that barely ... has a plot.
From what I understand, the ""plot"" goes like this...Tom Green plays a 28-year-old guy who has 2 goals in life, to be animator and to move out of his parents' house. The movie starts out with him going to Hollywood armed only with his drawings and his dreams. When he gets there, we realize his body of work consists of a few pieces of paper with pictures on it and he doesn't have a plot for the cartoon. That's it.... That's the whole movie.... I can only imagine that he walked into the studio with this script under his arm in that same fashion!! The rest of the movie is just a series of skits that are vile, disturbing and every once in a while, a little funny.... The only way to describe this movie is...it's like a bad acid trip!!!! This movie makes Me, Myself and Irene look like a comic masterpiece!",1016928000,4,1671,4.2578616352201255

And it's pointlessy gory, too. I mean, he cuts the cord of a women's new born baby by BITING IT WITH HIS TEETH, then swings it around and blood flys everywhere in the room! And he masturbates a horse... yes, he masturbates a horse. And it brilliantly ends with a kid get cut apart in the propellar of a airplane.

But this movie is really disgusting and terrible. Usually I like sick humor but this wasn't humor because I didn't feel it was original. I know I'm a nerd, but I do know a good movie when I see one. Like Election take for example. Their was sick things in that movie, but the begginning and towards the end were fantastic. This movie was bad from the begginning to the end.

Answer: you take MTV funny man Tom Green, a great script, an awesome supporting case, and a director who knows how to make comedy - and you have a delicious cocktail of hilarity that the whole audience gets to drink from!!  This was - without a doubt - one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and repeated viewings have only confirmed my desires!
Green plays a man who is teetering on the brink of insanity, riven with guilt over a failed relationship. His response: comedy. What follows is 96 minutes of hilarity, tomfoolery, sight gags, word plays, and a surprise ending that will keep you viewing again and again. I took my 3 year old daughter to it and she loved it!...
Naturally, there are the detractors that try to take away something from Tom Green, saying he isn't funny. Saying he's too caustic. Not original. Vulgar. Well, these critics don't understand the obvious subversive humor of Green - which seeks to expose our hypocrisies, to confront us with the daily lies and half-truths that we live our lives by. Who among us would not like to just retreat into the peaceful inner-child of the Green character and ""act out"" on our fantasies? Like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin before him, Green is essentially misunderstood in the context of post-modernist comedy theories.

Within the last year or so, a movie called LOST AND FOUND came out. It was an otherwise watchable romantic comedy, spoiled near the end by its effort to make a joke of a very unfunny matter - a false accusation of child abuse. Yet I heard no one criticize the movie for that. Let the movie makers get away with such failure to be in the same universe with good taste, and they'll get worse and worse. Now along comes the farce FREDDY GOT FINGERED, and they have the chutzpah to make the very title a false accusation of child abuse. The only up side this time is I didn't see where there would have been much of a movie to spoil anyway.

There's one scene where Gordon confronts his father. Make sure you have a box of kleenex next to you because it'll make you cry. It made me cry and reminded me of one of the last scenes from Ingmar Bergman's ""Autumn Sonata""

He was not to everyone's taste and many would say ""disgusting"" but to me he was a genius in a bizarre sort of way who knew how to create a ""masterpiece"". Then, he was given his own show on MTV. Some of the shows were funny but in no way was it the same. The magic was gone and so was Tom's sense of creativity .. or at least it was slipping .. Then, ""Freddy Got Fingered"" arrived on the big screen. WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT !! The Tom Green who we knew and watched from the very beginning of his tv career was gone. What you will see on screen is movie garbage at its worst ! It's comparable to watching someone masturbate on screen ! Now, how funny would that be ?? (I hope amazon.com prints this unedited because I want to disuade others from viewing this filth). Tom Green had the ability and the freedom to put something worthwile on film and he blew it big time ! This is definitely the worst thing I saw on video in my 30 years of life.

1637671,5,B00005NTOH,"Tom Green breaks onto the Hollywood scene with a film that is offensive, disgusting, and cruel.  Any decent person will declare Tom Green the AntiChrist after viewing this film.  But, in an EXTREMELY twisted and bizarre sort of way, it is also very funny and sweet.
Granted, he definitely takes things WAY over the top, down the other side, and all the way back for more, but, like it or not, that is the very reason that Tom Green exists in the first place.  His MTV show was all about pushing the boundaries of what you can say or do on TV, and this movie is all about doing absolutely anything to get a laugh.  You have to understand that Tom Green does not do these things because he thinks you will laugh, he does them because they make HIM laugh.  Twirling a newborn over his head by the umbilical cord, manually stimulating farm animals, having a young boy get battered and bloodied every time he appears oncreen, these are all things that Tom finds funny.  The truly amazing thing about this movie is that, through all of the gross-out crap and very, very, stupid things he does throughout, it still somehow manages to come across as innocent and sweet.  The critics and most people, really, will not agree with that statement at all, but it is all done in good humor.  He's not neccesarily trying to shock YOU, but rather he is attempting to one-up himself in each successive scene.
Tom Green is an artist, and though his vision is distorted and bizarre, he is still an artist, like it or not.  Even if you take away the gross-out humor, of which there is a lot, the movie is still peppered with brilliant bits.  The backwards man, getting past a security gate with gibberish, the ""Daddy would you like some sausage?"" bit, these, taken out of context, are hilarious and ingenious.  He refuses to follow anyone's rules but his own, and this film is a testament to that.
Bottom line, if you like Tom Green see it.  Everyone else, steer WAAAAAYYYYYYYY clear of this one.  Only a handful in a million will like this movie, and I am one of them.  This is not the usual everyday sanitized-for-your-protection kind of Hollywood garbage.  This is low-brow high art.",1011657600,5,2166,4.546391752577319

  I can tolerate grossout humor, but only to an extent. And I felt that they went a bit too over the top with it.  I have watched the Tom Green show so I kind of had a rough idea what to expect from it, And if you are a fan of the Tom Green show then you probably won't have any probelm with this movie.",1011398400,,600,3.901639344262295

I turned this movie on to end up laughing non-stop throughout the entire thing.  The sheer bizarrity of the film makes it sick, demented but hilarious.  The road kill scene kind of grossed me out but for the most part the movie was great.  The scene with the baby and the women chanting in the hospital room is just surreal.  It even has a little bit of a plot with Gord trying to prove himself to his father.  Gord's girlfriend is a bizarre handicapped woman who enjoys having her legs beat in the heat of passion.  Hilarious.
Definitely not for the squeamish.  I can't say you have no sense of humour if you don't like this movie because many of my friends who are big comedy fans didn't like it at all.

1637674,3,B00005NTOH,"""Freddie Got Fingered"" is demented even by the standards of the gross-out genre.  It's not so much a movie as it is a series of outrageous skits strung together.  Some are really funny: the scene with the skateboard ramp where Rip Torn begins screaming for no reason had me in stiches as did the shower scene where Torn tosses Tom Green through the shower door as well as the bizarre restaurant scene.  Others don't work so well but what they all have in common is an irreverance and subversiveness not seen in too many movies today.
That's not to say that I loved the movie or would recommend it.  Some of things Tom Green does are stomach turning and rightly so.  The ending is downright bad and reflects a tendency for movies to have unrealistic or contrived conclusions.  As well, while Rip Torn is outrageously funny in most of this, one can't help but wonder how low his career has sunk to play such a profane character.

By employing such a run of the mill story he is sending up the very notion of traditional Hollywood narrative. Unlike the Farrelly brothers who compromise their humour in order to convey a politicly correct message, Tom Green pulls no punches. When he wants to offend he does it the right way.

There are so many things wrong with this movie, that if I were to try and mention them all I'd be here all night, and I just don't have that time.  But I'll hit the big point on why this movie is so bad while I'm here.  First off, it's not funny.  I don't know why Mr. Green would think that people would get a kick out him crawling around in deerskin after he gutted it himself.

In the movie tom...uh...""plays with"" a horse and an elephant and covers himself in a roadkill deer's skin. Meanwhile all the charachters in the movie just don't seem to understand tom's over the top sense of humor and overreact to him. Overall the main plot is so weak that the only way they even try to keep viewers in the theater or on their couches are to give them an overkill dosage of what Tom usually does on his MTV show. Only this time it's not funny at all because all the pranks are being pulled on paid actors that have read the script and know what to expect. Pointless humor can be very funny (if not some of the best sort of humor) but the only people that would let out more than a chuckle are either hardcore Tom Green fans or they're going to laugh once they realized that the entire joke of the movie is that it wastes 90 mins of your life.",1010016000,8,1183,4.05982905982906

I think the critics missed the point on this one...it was intended to be marvellously stupid. Nothing made me happier to find that Tom Green was still hitting the mark in my books. Basically a story of a lazy, good-for-nothing kid trying to make a living as a cartoonist while simultaneously trying to live up to his dad's expectations is about the only way to describe this flick. From there it just descends into an anarchic free for all whose only intention is too make you laugh at the absurdity of it's premise. Watch as Tom helps a woman give birth and commence to bite the umbilical cord and swing the baby by the same cord to bring it to life. See Tom bring a lady to climax by wacking on her paralyzed legs with bamboo. Observe as Tom scuba dives in his shower. Laugh as his younger neighbour always gets in the path of flying objects. Somehow, Mr. Green ties all this together into some barely cohesive story. I just laughed harder and harder as the film progressed. He continually tops himself with every scene. Rip Torn is awesome as his abusive, taunting, world-weary father. Rip was always awesome on 'The Larry Sanders Show', and this movies further cements his greatness in my mind. Anthony Michael Hall is nearly unrecognizable as a slick producer at some nameless cartoon company. It's nice to see him working again. I can't put into words how absurd and ridiculous this flick is. When Tom licks the bone jutting from his best friend's shin, I screamed in delight. When Tom freaks out on a fake cell phone in a restaurant, firing the fake person on the other line for costing him 'forty million deutschmarks' I giggled uproarously. When Tom tells his mom to leave his father and pursue sex encounters with basketball players and Greek men, I nearly died. When he fondles a stud horse, I did die and go to heaven. I've given away quite a bit, but believe me, when you see it, you will STILL laugh! I wish every Hollywood comedy was this good! I hate the generic crime film within a comedy scenario. This is what filmmaking is about. The critics just lambasted it, but that's only because they're jealous that someone gave Mr. Green the money to make a movie like this, while they just continue to write reviews nobody reads. It's unfortunate when they clamour for something new and inventive and then fail to recognize when it's right under their noses. Awesome, awesome movie.",1009238400,5,2530,4.58719646799117
1637685,3,B00005NTOH,"There's a scene at the end of Freddy Got Fingered in which a throng of people are welcoming Tom Green's character home.  Many people are holding signs, one of which says, ""When the ... is this movie going to end?""  And if a film acknowledges its own limitations, perhaps you can't be too harsh on it.
And then again, perhaps you can.  Although Tom Green can't be faulted for being pretentious, he can be faulted for making a pretty damn bad film.  Essentially, the plot serves solely as a mechanism to string a bunch of ridiculous skits together.  I give the movie three stars because you have to admire Tom's dedication- the man will do literally anything for a laugh, and I freely admit laughing quite a bit during the viewing of Freddy Got Fingered.
In short, if you're familiar with Tom Green's comedy and you like it, this is worth checking out.  Given the utterly vapid nature of the film, however, I can't imagine actually purchasing this.  Unless you're easily entertained, either due to habitual use of chemical substances or naturally so, Freddy Got Fingered is not something that lends itself to repeat viewing.",1009152000,,1122,4.723076923076923

Co-starring and stealing every scene he's in is Rip Torn as Jim, Gord's dad who is just as crazy and more violent than his son!

The first time I saw this movie, I could only stomach an hour of it. So, just to be fair, I watched it again. I had no change of heart. I think that this movie tried to push the envelope of being raunchy and humorous and lost a lot. It was a half-baked plot with below average acting.

1637702,1,B00005NTOH,"There are many words that could describe this movie; lame, stupid, gross, immature, shocking...none of these words, however, capture the feeling of absolute disgust I felt after watching 'Freddy Got Fingered'. I'm a teenager. I do not have terribly high moral standards, and it takes a lot to offend me. I'm an avid watcher of MTV's 'Jackass' and Comedy Central's 'South Park'. So I figured that this movie would appeal to me. The first trademark Tom Green scene involved his character, Gord, standing on a conveyor belt at a chese sandwhich factory holding a sausage between his legs. Although I didn't find it very funny, I thought I'd continue watching.
This was not a good idea. The cheese factory scene was followed by a pretty graphic scene involving two horses having sex. After nearly puking, in a few minutes I witnessed Gord bite off the umbilical cord after yanking out a woman's baby. It got worse and worse as it went along. No where in the movie was there anything that resembled a plot; only these disgusting scenes, all involving sex, that were supposed to be funny. The jokes may appeal to twelve year olds that haven't heard any of these words before, but they're not funny to people with an actual sense of humor.
If you are a fan of the Tom Green show, you will probably not like this movie. If you have any taste at all, you will not like this movie. If you do not enjoy seeing someone masturbate an elephant, you will not like this movie (and yes, this really does happen).

Too many people now in days want ""sophisticated"" comedy. Well, you won't find it here.

For Tom to make a completely ridiculous movie just to attack all the people who DON'T get the joke. And, judging by the press reviews, it worked.

If a movie is nothing more than watching grass grow for three hours, it is not a success because it set out to bore us and it did.

This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and not one of those ""so bad it's funny"" movies like Hudson Hawk or Plan 9. It was insulting, disgusting, horrifying, and just plain awful. This movie aims very very low, and overachieves in that regard. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!",993686400,11,545,4.405940594059406
1637726,2,B00005NTOH,"In this film, Tom Green stars as Gord Brody, a 28 years-old who seems to be stuck in his parents apartment for ever, unless he can finally realize his long life dream of becoming a cartoonist. But the plot isn't really worth discussing. It's all just an excuse for putting Tom Green in different situations where he can let his &#8220;talent&#8221; run wild. These situations include Tom Green beating a crippled girl with a stick, convincing the State that his father has been molesting his brother, Freddie, for several years (hence the title, FREDDIE GOT FINGERED)... Some of this is funny, sure, but most of it is just annoying (and the constant screaming and jellying of Tom Green makes it even more annoying). I agree with the critics who butchered this film (for the most part its not good). I would recommend you seeing this film before purchasing it (even if you're a Tom Green fan (because I too like some of what he's done on television)).",991958400,,950,4.6946107784431135

The movie is excellent, especially for those who consider themselves social rebels or social liberals, or for those who are sick of the prim & proper crap that goes on in the places they live in.
If you'd love to moon the establishment, this movie is for you!

1637728,4,B00005NTOH,"""Freddie Got Fingered"" is...Well...Funny, I can't really Defend it Any Better. I found it funny, Disagree if you must. (I Dare not Mock the people who Disagree with me; there are probably a Lot More of them, my Mother for one)
In this Ill-Conceived but none-the-less Hilarious film, TV Funny man Tom Green makes the Dangerous Leap to the Big Screen. (and falls to his Death by the hand of an Angry mob of Critics and Paying Audiences) It looks like a Biography of his life, but for His sake I hope it Wasn't. Green plays Gord Brody, a 28-year-old Slacker who lives in his Parents Basement and Dreams of becoming an Animator. Standing in his way are A: Lack of Talent, B: His Father (Rip Torn) and C: His New Job at the Cheese Factory.
The Plot is pretty Inconsequential as it's All just an Excuse for Green to Display his Brand of Physical, Gross Out Comedy. Green will either Make or Break this film for you, if you've never found him funny Before, this film is Definitely not for you, if you Enjoy his TV Antics, you'll most likely Enjoy the Film. He does take Gross out comedy to the Extreme, so Be Prepared. Some of it is Stomach-Churningly Shocking, some of it is Gut-Wretchingly Gross, All of it is Hilarious. (when I say All, that as Virtually all, some parts even I didn't laugh at, I must be Growing Up... Man that's scary)",990576000,3,1332,4.41869918699187
1637729,1,B00005NTOH,"They probably would've repealed the 1st Amendment to save the country from releasing such digital disgust. The 'in thing' in movies is an attempt to push the freedom of expression to it's absolute limits, and then use commercialism and marketing to target a younger audience than the film should ever be shown to. While at the theater two weeks ago, I saw two girls (aged 7-11) who were begging their parents to let them see it. Now that's just horrendous.
But at an attempt to be fair, I grabbed a screener off the Net, and I wasn't surprise at the films audacity one bit. Tasteless, pointless, plotless...useless. Strange...that's the same way I felt about Tom Green in the first place.
If you're over 17, have no job, dropped out of high school, and have no self-respect and no sense of humor, drop by the theater and see if you can get your victimized parents (whom you'll likely live with till your 45) to give you $ to go see this movie. You'll love it, I'm sure.
The rest of decent society, stay away. Parents, if you let your kids see this -- you are irresponsible. And that coming from an 18-year-old is pretty bad.",990489600,10,1124,4.514705882352941

When I first saw ""Freddy Got Fingered"", it was just the way that I wanted it to be, just like ""The Tom Green Show"".  Although this movie's plot was lame, I really didn't care!  And to all the critics out there who criticized this movie, I have something to say, ""Tom Green put so much time and effort into this hillarious movie, he even did his own stunts!  I have to give Tom Green all the credit in the world to write and direct his own 2 hour long movie!  I'm sick of all you critics saying how gross and disgusting this movie is, that is just how Tom Green is, gross and disgusting, and also hillarious!  You critics are just a bunch of lazy fat lards who would never put any time and work into anything, especially a movie!""

1637731,2,B00005NTOH,"I went into this movie hearing that it's not really that good, but I like Tom Green, so I decided to give it a chance.  Did I do the wrong thing?  Yes.  This movie is really bad.  Even for fans of the show, it wears a little thin when you enter the hour and a half mark.  There were a couple moments where I laughed at the material and other times when I just laughed at how truly bad it was.  I understand what Green was trying to accomplish with the story, but I just feel he went about it the wrong way.  He was trying to portray the importance of making your parents proud after they raise you, but I don't think you do that by ummm doing ""things"" to animals.  You don't want to know what those ""things"" are trust me.  In the future I would recommend that Tom stick to acting and let someone else write the movies.",990230400,,818,4.031055900621118

Now, my friends and I are very mature for our ages, and we went to see the movie together. There was no problem getting in- the workers in the theater didn't even ask for ID. Sure, the comedy was gross and crude- but it was meant to be. And if Green offended you, he obviously meant to. Tom Green likes to push people's buttons, and people today are much too easily offended. I for one, found the movie unendingly funny, even if some of the crudeness made me cringe a little. I laughed nonstop, and this is the only movie that has EVER made me do that. Let me tell you, he has to be doing something right. Go Tom- no matter what the critics say, you achieved what you set out to and that is something worth respecting. People have to learn that life can't be taken so seriously.

It KNEW that having Tom Green swing a dead baby around the room by it's umbilical cord would make people question their own ethics for seeing it. Thats why it was so wonderful. The film make so little sense, that it bordered on genius. The whole thing was so absurd, that I turned around to see other's reactions. EVERYONE in the theatre had this ""What the heck is this?!"" look on their face. Im sure they all hated the movie. And that... is why I loved it. call me unintelligent, but if you look at the movie as a ethic breaker, you may agree.

1637734,3,B00005NTOH,"A number of critics have been bashing the hell out of this movie. Perhaps some complaints are justified: the editing in this movie reaches near-incoherent status at a number of points, there is no logical plot to speak of, there are continuity errors galore and, in general, Green shows an almost total disregard of the normal idioms of filmmaking. Bizarrely enough, that's why I liked -- or maybe I should say, admired -- this movie (although I should say that I liked it with reservations). There are parts of the movie that are very funny. There are also parts that are just grotesque. I think, however, that Tom Green is a very brave man to put these images on celluloid and display them to the world.
One reason that I respect this movie is Green's unerrant (if admittedly twisted) desire to stick to his guns no matter how disgusting his ideas may be. Many of the sick jokes in the film are funny, and many aren't so funny as much as simply audacious. I respect a movie that is willing to blatantly question what exactly it is that we consider funny and ""correct"" in a film. Oh, and did I mention that it's funny? It truly is; although I should say that if you aren't a fan of Tom Green to begin with then you certainly will NOT like this movie. I give this movie three stars if for no other reason than it's a totally one-of-a-kind movie that can honestly promise to show you things you've never seen before. And it truly is not as awful as the reviews say -- to hear many people talk about this movie, it is as inept as Battlefield Earth and Sphere. This is not at all true; Green knows exactly what he is doing. Of course, it may be the case that what Green is doing is not what you would like to see in a movie; that's fine, and I totally understand that. I've heard this movie described as gleefully anarchic; if that sounds good to you, then by all means see this movie. Frankly, I'm still trying to sort out exactly what it all means . . . .",988502400,,1954,4.29810298102981
