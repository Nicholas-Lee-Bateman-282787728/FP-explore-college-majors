3513163,5,B001CIOCO4,"Metaphorically Gordon's Stuck could be viewed as the result of Reganomics and the trickle down theory which viewed in present day only works if the trickle starter were upside down.  A social commentary with many layers along the lines of Romero's Dawn of the Dead(78) where the main character hits a man with her car and drives home with him ""stuck"" in the windshield.  For fear of losing her promotion at work decides she would rather commit murder than lose her job and even her neighbors' pass on helping him for fear of being deported.

Don't like your job?  Stuck.  Want to sell your home?  Stuck.  Cash out your investments?  Stuck.  Put gas in your car?  Stuck.  Want to remain sane but are tied up S&M style with red tape?  Stuck.

Negatively we can look at it like Gilliam's brilliant (uncut) film Brazil and that the only way to be free is to go crazy.  Positively the trick is to have no windshield or to many of us will end up like Flick in A Christmas Story, crying stuck? Stuck? Stuck!",1232755200,,1000,4.45303867403315
3513164,1,B001CIOCO4,"I'm aware this is based on a true story, to whatever extent this may be true, but boy did they ever epicly fail in their quest to adapt this true story to film. I'm in shock that this complete trash can be rated this highly. This has some of the worst acting I've seen, and it compliments the bad writing of the movie awfully well.

Story: Guy gets hit by car, severely wounded, stuck in car windshield, near death. Rest of the movie is us watching Mena Suvari try to cover up the accident. And now here comes the list of deficiencies in the movie, in more or less in the order they happened, with a couple tangents included:

**Worst...intro...to a movie...EVER. Who's idea was it to show Mena Suvari in slow motion with rap music playing in the background as she cares for the elderly at the nursing home?

**Did they seriously just include the unnecessary side story of the guy getting evicted and his trouble at the job agency, as a way for us to become sympathetic to the character? Seriously? Mr. writer/director, just...go away, go bury yourself or something...

**Speaking of the guy that got evicted, did the landlord tell him that he COULDN'T take his own belongings as he was leaving?? Did I miss something or is that what actually happened? How can you not have a right to your possessions?

**The acting is so unrealistic in this movie. When the guy goes to the job agency, the way they have the secretary and the other guy behind the desk who tells him to mail an application is just too over the top abrupt and mean. There's just no one that talks that way. They're caricatures.

**When the guy's dog came back after licking the bloody leg of the car crash victim, his owner reacted completely unrealistically. 1) You would immediately notice the RED BLOOD near his mouth in contrast to the dog's hair color (and it took him an eternity to notice it), and 2) and this is HORRIBLE writing, why did the owner immediately conclude that his dog must've been in the garbage???? Think about it, if you have a beloved pet, and you see BLOOD on him after he returned from an unknown location, during which you may or may not have heard slight whimpering sounds, would you not first be fearful and want to make sure it's not HIS OWN blood? Wouldn't you quickly inspect him to make sure HE'S not the one that's been hurt? God, dumb writers..

**I won't criticize this one too much since I'm not a health expert, but the crash victim stuck seems to have an inconsistent level of energy to him in the movie. One moment he can barely lift his head, and in another moment he can swiftly disarm a 235 lb man with deadly accuracy then murder him with relative ease. Maybe human strength does fade in and out like that, but I don't know, it just seemed silly.

**I guess there's a first time for everything since I've never criticized subtitles in a movie before...until now. The dialogue between Pedro and his mother...LMAO. Wow. Did they have budget problems and so couldn't hire a professional interpreter? The good samaritan Pedro is trying to tell his mother that there's a guy hurt in the garage, stuck in the window, etc. Here's the translated subtitle:

""The man is hurt.""
""What man?""
""Man in garage.""
""See spot run.""
""Hop on pop.""

Pretty much is how it came across.

**Bad acting by Pedro's mother. As she's being led by her son to the garage where the victim lies, why would she bring up the issue of it being private property and so is fearing to go any closer? We're not talking about some gated community here. Also, when she agrees to go, why as they're walking, does she come to a FULL STOP on the sidewalk, in order to tell her son that yes, she will go this one time. Play that out in your mind if you were that person, wouldn't you pretty much be saying that AS you're moving? (like, ""ok, I'll go, but...whatever."" You don't come to complete halt to make that statement unless you're some simple organism).

**Another hit against Pedro's mom- As she's peering in the garage window and sees the man stuck in the car window, why did she bang on the window so damn long to tell him that she's going to get help? This jumped out at me because I could see if she just kinda banged on it, hollered out that she's going to get help, and off she goes, but it's the fact that she did it for so LONG. She would bang five times, stop, then bang again, stop, and repeat. What was she expecting him to do? COME OPEN THE DOOR?

**Mena Suvari looked...very unappealing the entire movie.

What could've been a decent thriller is absolutely killed by the terrible acting and bad writing.",1229731200,5,4587,4.4517282479141835
3513165,4,B001CIOCO4,"STUCK is one of those films that creeps up on you, teases you into thinking a comedy is in the making, then slowly reveals itself as what seems to be an expos of our current manner of getting through life, of competing in the workplace, and of self absorption to the point of endangering those around us. The fact that the film is based on a true story as adapted by director Stuart Gordon and transformed into a bitingly satirical screenplay by John Strysik increases the impact of this well-crafted little low budget film.  Watch it once for the gritty content of the story, then watch it again to appreciate all of the very dark (and very pointed!) humor in what at first appears to be a grisly tale.

Brandi Boski (Mena Suvari) works as a Nurse's Aid in a nursing home of senile elderly patients, giving some of the finest care for those entrusted to her talents.  Brandi's compassionate work is noted by the supervisor Peterson (Carolyn Purdy-Gordon) who manages to trick Brandi into an even heavier work schedule by suggesting a raise in position. Excited about her possible promotion Brandi and her working partner Tanya (Rukiya Bernard) celebrate that evening with Brandi's boyfriend/drug supplier Rashid (Russell Hornsby) who gives Brandi a pill of Ecstasy and the mixture of the drug with the alcohol creates a mess of Brandi's mind.

The parallel story involves one jobless Thomas Bardo (Stephen Rea) who lives in a tenement, is evicted because of past due rent, and becomes a street person, treated with cold (but satirical) mechanical responses at the Department of Unemployment. Left to sleep in the park he is befriended by another homeless person, given a shopping cart, and makes his way toward a midnight mission.

Brandi cum altered thought processes drives home, hits Thomas who comes sailing through her windshield badly injured, and out of fear and distress Brandi merely takes the 'stuck' Thomas home to park him in her garage, knowing that her boyfriend Rashid will help her.  Thomas is conscious, unable to climb out of the glass of the crushed windshield and begs for help.  How the stranded and injured Thomas is treated by the desperate but self-centered Brandi, by the frightened but macho Rashid, and by neighbors who fear intervention because of reporting an incident that would encourage police intervention and threaten their deportation as illegal immigrants results in an ending that shows how 'justice' can prevail!

The cast is first rate - especially Rea, Suvari, Hornsby and Bernard.  The direction is tight and maintains credible characters in incredible situations and holds the audience attention every moment.  This is a fine example of how a low budget film, in the hands of pros, can be more successful that the big budget, less thoughtful movies that crowd our marquis.

3513166,4,B001CIOCO4,"After a fun evening out on the town, my date and I stopped to rent a movie. She picked ""Stuck.""  I first thought ""oh, God, I am going to be 'stuck' in B movie hell for the rest of the evening. I suggested that I first log onto Amazon.com to check the reviews on the movie before we committed to it (I know, I am a movie review geek!). She insisted that we just try it out without reading reviews. This made me cringe because I almost never gamble like this with my beloved movies. We watched the movie and I actually enjoyed the film much more than my date! It was really entertaining!

I thought the acting was fairly decent, Mena Suvari did a good job as well as the other main characters,  and the movie was quite suspenseful and held my attention throughout. I even was satisfied with the ending. I think this movie at least deserves a rental.",1225670400,2,847,4.248447204968944
3513167,3,B001CIOCO4,"Stuck, starring Mena Suvari, is a dark, urban drama of sorts that centers on a true event.  Although in real life the outcome was different, the makers of this film seemed to create quite a few different scenarios that all keep one on the edge of their seats.  Suvari does an excellent job in her part, as the nurses assistant whose balance between an up and coming career and a big, partying lifestyle are disrupted one night when she is involved in a hit and run accident that takes the victim home with her.

I was expecting much less in terms of a good script and memorable characters, and overall was surprised at the careful detail that was laid out for this film.  Sure, it isn't anything to write home about, but still smooth, as well as gritty enough, to keep your attention.  The final scene has a few surprises in it and even adds a few slight touches of humor as well.",1225411200,4,880,4.374233128834356
3513168,4,B001CIOCO4,"Like David Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon has strayed from the horror genre for his last few films, but he's still got the knack for the gruesome and disturbing.  With Stuck he uses the 2001 Chante Mallard case as the basis for this film.  Mena Suvari(an actress I could never stand) works at a nursing home and is first choice for a promotion.  While driving home from a night of partying and screwing around on her cell phone(Ya See? Ya See?  They've been telling us it's dangerous and no one listens!) she hits Stephen Rea.  Rea has pretty much just become a bum.  He was downsized and his life goes from crappy to very crappy.  Soon he's pushing a cart around and looking for somewhere to sleep.  So, he ends up stuck in Suvari's windshield, but she has no intentions of helping the man.  She's scared, she's got a big promotion on the way, and most importantly, she believes the incident was Rea's fault, not her own.  The movie really pushes this point home as Suvari keeps saying, ""It wasn't my fault"" or yells, ""Why are you doing this to me??"" to a bloodied and shredded Stephen Rea who's dangling helpless from her windshield.  You really grow to despise her quite quickly.  I didn't need much help since I don't like her anyway.
With time running out and problems mounting at the workplace, Suvari gets her drug dealing boyfriend in on it, and they devise a plan to kill Rea and dispose of his body.  Meanwhile, Rea is going through the agonizing process of trying to free himself from the window glass as well as trying to call attention to himself and fruitlessly begging Suvari.
Needless to say it's pretty off the wall and crazy stuff.  But as they say, truth is stranger than fiction.  Though this film was based on a true crime, much of it is fictionalized.  Some scenes and points made in the film are straight from the news story, but in reality the man died only after a few hours of being stuck in the glass.  This film has to make it a bit more exciting than that, so things go in a totally different direction than they actually did in real life.
Though I'll always love and think of Gordon as a horror film director, I've really enjoyed his past three non-horror films.  I hope he keeps it up.",1224806400,5,2211,4.45771144278607

3513170,1,B001CIOCO4,"This film should never have happened. Right from the start, Rap music blasts the F and N every other word.  One does not have to be a child to be offended by this vulgar and ignorant rythmic ranting. There are many talented and yes educated musicians willing to work and has the talent to be called musicians.
The film lacks directorship as clearly indicated by the sensationalism of drugs.  Most audiences for this type of film will be teens and young adults targeting once again the young and vulnable of America. Possession and the  distribution of ECTASY IS illegal, yet, the directors allowed the sensationalized and simulated use of the drug just as casual as taking an aspirin.  Sensationalizing this drug on screen to anyone is building the hype that could and unfortunately does lead to ingesting the drug, destoying the user, their family and others.  Communities and families struggle daily with drugs, their abuse and death of our young people.
 Directors who allow the sensationalism of drugs on the screen to anyone should be dealt with by the public  accordingly.  Sensationalizing drugs is enabling and if directors cannot use professional judgment in allowing the flagrant use of drugs such as what was evident in this film should be illegal, since we cannot trust the film industry to use any moral or  decent judgment and lets not forget the Political agenda that pushed during one of the numerous sex scenes. Films such as this should be cancelled well before it comes to the screen.  Most disappointing was the fact that Blockbuster was in association with Image and Rigel Entertainment.  Blockbuster the ""family video store,"" needs more professional critics to view these films before they support drugs, filth, vulgarity and lack of acting and directing skills and someone's political agenda.  I was suprised to see Stephen Rea appear in such a gangly and poor attempt at screenwriting and filmmaking. The one star rating only appears because I cannot truly rate this film in the minus.  I have always liked Stephen Rea, but I will be more apprehensive in the future to watch any other film featuring him.  I do not believe in censorship however, this film needs to be removed from the public.",1223164800,4,2216,4.922043010752688

My full review available at IMDB, under the title, ""Best B-Movie Since BOUND.""  In it, I marvel at how tight the movie is ... how it never drags.  Shortening it can ONLY lessen it, and if the black joke with the dog is gone, it's not even the same movie.

3513172,4,B001CIOCO4,"So, this is what is life in America?  Joking aside, this is a terrific look at the consequences of the ""culture of success"" permeating the United States.  Which is in fact no success at all, but mostly submission to bosses, bureaucracy and money.  It is the law of the jungle in ""Stuck"", but when Stephen Rea, a victim of downsizing, gets stuck in Mena Suvari's windshield he seems still incapable to understand that his society no longer functions, and waits for her to get help.  That never comes.  I don't see this film as a black comedy but as an indictment, a suspenseful look at the effects of a socially inept landscape in some individuals fighting to maintain their status in the ranks of the low class (they are... stuck!).  More insight and this could have been masterful.  As it is, it constitutes a very enjoyable action film.",1221264000,16,838,4.621621621621622

3513216,3,B001CIOCO4,"Stuck (2007) is a tale of suspense that may not be very believable, but it is still quite entertaining.  The movie has an appeal similar to that of a train wreck, or other disaster, as it is something quite terrible, yet is fascinating to watch.  Supposedly inspired by real life events, so much of what happens is quite outrageous, and the extent to which reality is stretched becomes increasingly extreme as the story progresses.

Brandi Boski (Mena Suvari) is a caregiver in a retirement home.  She and her friend and co-worker Tanya (Rukiya Bernard), are out parting at a club, where they hook up with Brandi's drug dealer boyfriend Rashid (Russell Hornsby), who lays some pills on the ladies.

Already down on his luck, Thomas Bardo (Stephen Rea) is a man who's life is about to get a lot worse.  Having just been kicked out of his apartment, he is sleeping on a park bench when he is rousted by a cop, and told to move on.  Bardo is crossing the street with a shopping cart, when a distracted Brandi plows into him with her car.  Bardo crashes through the windshield on the passenger side, and gets lodged there.  With the injured man on her hood, a panicked Brandi first drives to a hospital, and is about to drag the body off her car, but is scared off, and heads home and hides the body in an enclosed garage.

With a warped view of reality, Brandi selfishly rationalizes what she has done, blaming Bardo for the accident.  She does tell Rashid that she hit a homeless person, but not that her hit and run victim is still attached to her car.  The next morning, Bardo begins to sound the car horn, so Brandi knocks him out with a board, and then heads off to work.

Although many of the events do not seem very believable, this unique situation soon escalates to extreme levels.  With Brandi's complete self-centeredness, and Rashid's willingness to commit murder, things snowball and lead to disaster.  What Bardo does also defies belief, as he manages to get free, patch himself up, and then fight back with a ferocity and determination that would make Harrison Ford proud.

Compared to some of his previous projects, Stuck may be a little tame for director Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator, From Beyond), who handles things very competently, particularly when matters get violent.  The over the top finale is quite shocking, and smoothly executed.  The plot is outlandish, but the strong performances by the cast, particularly Mena Suvari (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B005721Y7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>) and Stephen Rea (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crying-Game/dp/B00006FI3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crying Game</a>), do make for a compelling watch.

Accidentally hitting someone with a vehicle is a situation could occur, and as the decision to go from stopping and helping, to committing a hit and run, might take place in a split second, it's understandable that Brandi might panic.  What is a much harder to accept however, is that the possibility of escaping responsibility exists, when an injured man is attached to your vehicle.",1327190400,,3177,5.2043222003929275

The female is thought highly of at work.  Caring, responsible, attentive, a nurses aide???? But the second she clocks out she is completely the opposite.  Drinking, drugs, and driving... Hits some guy who is already down on his luck and leaves him stuck to her car.  I guess she is off the clock.  This movie was frustrating, but good.  Think about yourself.

3513218,4,B001CIOCO4,"Well this was a surprise to me on all levels. I like this movie but must say that it is not everybody's cup of tea. It's a mean spirited story of a hit and run and the way some folks just look the other way. The story has some basis in fact and I remember hearing such a tale from FORT WORTH, Texas. This makes the movie that much freakier to me. The other odd thing in my mind is Stephen Rea is the man actor in this movie and for him to be in this just seem a bit of over kill, he is just to good of an actor for this role but may in fact save the whole film.
Mena Suvari is Brandi the main star of the story and she is pretty good here (well I did hate the corn rows but that is what was needed for the part).
Sex, Drugs and gore may be part of our society but not something every one wants to see.",1289174400,2,801,3.6627906976744184
3513219,5,B001CIOCO4,"A relatively low budget but searching and fascinating film.  Our 'heroine' is Brandi who is presented as an attractive and caring young woman who works in a nursing home, sensitively taking care of elderly and senile people many of whom can no longer control their bodily functions.  Not surprisingly, her somewhat smarmy supervisor tells Brandi that she is 'under consideration' to become the supervisor of other nursing assistants.

Next scene, however, shows her in a rather seedy cub where she meets and passinately kisses a guy who looks like he's a pimp and drug pusher.  High on alcohol and drugs, Brandi leaves the club only to cell phone her pimp-looking 'friend', inviting him to come over.  Brandi is clearly not attentive to her driving and hits a newly-homeless man who becomes stuck halfway in her shattered windshield.

Rather than stop and call 911, the cops or both--she incredibly drives into her garage with the moaning man still stuck in her windshied.  'You should have watched where you were walking.' She complains to her helpless victim, and goes into her house to call her pimp-looking friend for help.

The rest of the movie you've just got to see.  It turns out that cute little Brandi is just about as selfish and self-centered as a human being could possibly be.  She allows herself to be seduced by her pimp-drug pusher with the suffering, probably dying, victim only a few feet away.  Later she yells at the bloodied man impaled in her windshield, 'Why did you do this to me?' and hits him in the head with a 2 X 4.

This movie is a scathing indictment of the 'ME' generation.  Obviously Brandi is an extreme example of a generational model, but sometimes extremes make the point better than averages.  Brandi is a good nursing assistant because such an occupation meets her talents and advances her cause.  Brandi, at the very same time, is ruthless and completely uncaring about anyone or anything that disrupts the flow of her life.",1287964800,3,1966,4.809523809523809

3513222,5,B001CIOCO4,"As I watched ""Stuck,"" I tried to figure out which category it belongs to. But, of course, it ultimately doesn't make any difference. One way or the other, ""Stuck"" is a swift, entertaining melodrama. From the beginning, even before the movie began, I had my doubts. It claims to be ""inspired by a true story."" What on earth does that mean? I've tentatively decided on the following categories:
  A. The truth itself (not possible in a movie)
  B. documentary-style truth (everything ""real,"" but obviously edited)
  C. ""based on a true story"" (characters, main events as they actually happened, but changes in dialogue, conflation of characters, etc.)
  D. ""inspired [like ""Stuck""] by a true story"" (some event is the starting point for what is basically fiction)
  E. fiction.
I'm sure, though, there are several subcategories. It's a pointless exercize, but fun.  The question in my title comes down. I suppose, to intention. Is all the absurdity in the film intentional? Are the film makers laughing with us? When I was watching the film, I thought it had either turned into or degenerated into a dark comedy. In retrospect, though, I see the absurdity of it all from the beginning, from the meaningless ""inspired by a true story,"" in fact.  After all, what fictional event isn't ""inspired"" by life itself?  So we watch a man steal his own clothes because his landlord (and presumably he himself) believes the landlord has a right to keep a tenant's property when the tenant leaves his apartment owing rent. And what does he ""steal""? A couple of suits, which he carries with him crumpled in a ball (that'll help him!) to a job interview that doesn't exist. The ""interview"" itself features a wonderful visual cliche, showing Bardot in a crowded waiting room which in a series of cuts gets increasingly less crowded until he's alone. You can see it coming a mile away, so the very cliche becomes absurd. He meets an almost mystically kindly homeless man in the park, who gives him liquor and mysteriously hints that they will meet again (which, in a sense they do). All of this prepares the way for the great wave of absurdities that follow. So I guess I have answered my own pointless question. Whatever the answer, the film is well worth your time.",1269129600,4,2249,4.795336787564767
3513223,3,B001CIOCO4,"The setup for Stuck seems pretty ridiculous, but it's actually based on a true story.  After a night of partying, the young Brandi (Mena Suvari) commits a hit and run on a homeless man (Stephen Rea).  Such a tragic mistake, and here's the horrible kicker--the guy is wedged tightly in the windshield of her car!  Quite a crazy predicament, and Brandi is of course stricken with panic.

So what does she do?  Drives home, drops some more ecstasy and has sex with her boyfriend.  Just leaves the poor guy bleeding to death in her garage?  Well, I suppose we all deal with stress in different ways.

I can appreciate the dark comedy of this story and realize it might be a statement about the current mindset that seems to be prevalent in our culture.  People having a reckless pursuit of personal happiness along with a selfish disregard for responsibility.  It also plays other stereotypes out to comical effect.

But the humor eventually goes from being subtle (a cop unaware of the car passing behind him with a bloody passenger on the hood?) to extremely silly (death by a ball point pen?) (ah geez).  Oh well.

Overall, this was somewhat entertaining and original.  This movie includes profanity, violence, drug use, and nudity.  Written and directed by Stuart Gordon.",1266883200,5,1271,4.792626728110599

I was watching the film in real-time and needed to take a bathroom break - but could NOT leave the chair:  the movie is that gripping.  Rent it - buy it - borrow it - but most definitely watch it.

3513225,4,B001CIOCO4,"Stuck is a short, tightly crafted, low budget survival thriller on the surface.  Stephen Rea stars as Thomas Bardo, a seemingly weak older man who is having quite possibly the worst day of his life. Forced onto the streets without any home to return to or job to assist him in regaining any quality of life, he is then literally thrusted into an even worse fate as the victim of a hit and run by a young, nurse/elderly caregiver who is high on ecstacy.  What makes matters even worse is that he's still lodged in the windshield of the inebriated, young woman's car as she proceeds to panic and drive home unnoticed, then parking the car in the garage! The film avoids stereotypes and presents characters that you really believe could exist.  Sadly (and bizarrely), this film is based around a real incident that happened in Texas in 2001.  Once the film introduces it's principal characters and the plot kicks in there are simply no dull moments to be found.  It is a violent, unflinching look at the blatant absurdity of some aspects in our culture which at times is able to bring about humor within the film.  Aside from strong performances from Mena Suvari and veteran Stephen Rea, who can both conjure up feelings of sympathy, disgust, hatred, and even empathy in viewers, this dark thriller-comedy is loaded with subtle and not-so-subtle statements about the conditioning of our own society that causes people to commit to poor, sometimes truly irrational actions when they are faced with difficult choices.  Is any human being's life worth ignoring and sacrificing for your own gains?  The rest of the cast is equally effective as is the film's pacing.  The film is directed by Stuart Gordon, who seems like an odd choice with his past filmography, but he has struck a winner with this completely effective film that may divide audiences due to it's resistance to follow typical thriller conventions as well as the film's brutal violence and bleak, but mostly authentic story.  Since it is based on a true event the film presents a challenge to it's audience: Always face your fears in your own life, despite the consequences, and survive by making the correct choices and carrying them out even at the worst and most desperate of times.  While you watch the film you will begin to wonder what you would do in any of the film's main or supporting character's situations.  It's also a notable reminder to not ""judge a book by it's cover"" as any individual can surprise you in positive or negative ways. The disc also has a good documentary showcasing interviews with the filmmakers as well as the actual reporter who covered the real life case.",1265500800,3,2649,4.759825327510917

I give it 5 stars because I think the film maker was able to get all he could out of this premise. The film starts quickly and never lets up for it's entire hour and 25 minute running length. It's captures the complex conflict of right and wrong and shows the fine line between human compassion and self preservation with some interesting contradictions all rolled into an intense black comedy that will have you filling with rage one minute and laughing hysterically the next. It's a little gory and repulsive at times, but it's sure to keep you glued to the screen. This is a film that I think will become a huge cult hit and it's way above average for films of this nature.",1261958400,8,789,4.374149659863946

3513228,2,B001CIOCO4,"Brandi Boski (Mena Suvari) is a committed nurse. She is having a good day because she's got a promotion at home for senior people. Brandi goes to a night club after work, meets her boyfriend who is also a drug dealer, and drives home under the influence. On her way she runs over a man, Thomas Bardo, (Stephen Rea), and she runs away terrified, with the victim stuck in the car windshield. She puts her car in the garage, but to her surprise, he is still alive, asking for help. So what will she do?

The premise is interesting--""Stuck"" is inspired by a true event that happened in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2001. The story is basically a thriller and there are many twists and turns intended to keep us guessing what is next in store. Many things happen and some of them are really surprising - or impossible - but definitely nasty.

In spite of gores and broken bones, tension fails to rise as it should because after all nurse Brandi's choices are limited from the beginning and she only delays her decision. To make a feature-length film out of this thin idea, the script of ""Stuck"" relies on poorly-conceived plot devices that only stall the story--side story about Thomas recently evicted; social satires (apathetic and bureaucratic workers at employment services) and occasional dark humor. You may giggle at Mena Suvari's love scene (brief nudity if you are interested) or a lovely dog licking the poor guy's fractured bone. But sorry, I was bored.

Or perhaps we should take her character and everything else as a parable. Maybe. But as a social commentary or character study, ""Stuck"" is too shallow to take seriously with stock characters and the leading lady's overacting. Inconsistencies within a character can be intriguing, and Mena Suvari's character, first seen as a dedicated nurse, then as an irresponsible hit-and-run driver, has a potential for insightful thriller. But instead of giving more details about her character and much subtler treatment of them, like in ""The Collector"" and ""The Crying Game,"" Stuart Gordon-directed film seeks an easy way out - cheap thrills just like the heroine of the film.

""Stuck"" has an intriguing concept, which could have been developed better with a simpler, more straightforward approach. The result is a confusion, not without fun, I admit, but ultimately unsatisfactory.",1251417600,,2326,4.926020408163265
3513229,4,B001CIOCO4,"""Stuck"" will stick with you for quite awhile after you see it.
Great acting by Mena Suvari and Stephen Rea and a very clever story""read synopsis""..Brandi played by Suvari is unapologetic and Sociopathic in her attempt to cover up the fact that she has hit a man ""Rea"" while intoxicated and he is stuck in her windshield like a love bug .

What ensues after that is terrifying and darkly humorous at the same time,but all the while I felt much sympathy for Rea's character,He was already down on his luck ,couldn't find a job and this was his first night living on the streets..and her car was the last thing he needed to come across and likewise as he was the last thing she and her car needed to come across..It turns into a cat and mouse game between Suvari's character Rea's and Suvari's thug boyfriend.

it plays out quite cleverly and was fun to watch.
There's a line in the movie that stuck with me, after Suvari's character left Rea stuck in the windshield and told him she was calling help but decided against it and went to bed. The next morning when she found he was still alive she looks at the bloody beat up Rea stuck in her windshield and say's""why are you doing this to me?

3513230,4,B001CIOCO4,"If you'd like to be disgusted, search for the name Chante Mallard.  What you'll find is the story of a drug/alcohol intoxicated woman, who hit a man named Gregory Biggs with her car while she was driving home.  After the collision she completed her trip, parked in the garage, and proceeded to callously let Biggs bleed-out (officials believe he would have lived if given medical help) while she had sex with her boyfriend and no doubt did whatever else her morally decayed black heart desired.

Since no audience would appreciate simply seeing a man slowly bleed to death while stuck in a car windshield, the makers of this movie took some liberties with the truth.  I'm ecstatic they did.

Thomas Bardo (Stephen Rea) is down on his luck.  Evicted, jobless, possession-less, he doesn't even have a place to sleep.  When police wake him from slumber on a park bench, he's forced to make his way toward a mission.

Meanwhile, Brandi Boski (Mena Suvari - miscast because Mallard is an obese black woman) is a soulless, selfish drug-abuser who is getting trashed and partying the night way.  (Suvari really manages to pick out character roles that make me despise her)  Many other reviewers may view her as ""balanced"", but since she's a drug-using drunk driver, and is a white girl with corn-rows - which never looks good - I'm going to go ahead and say that she's incredibly unbalanced and vile.

As if it were a surprise, she's blitzed out of her mind (thanks to X and alcohol), effing with her cell phone, swerving all over, and she blasts Bardo, mangling his legs and lodging him in the windshield.  Drunk or not, people with a shred of humanity stop there and help the man.  But not this intellectually, morally, and spiritually defective sociopath.  Instead, she goes home and has the least appealing non-rape full-frontal nudity, sex scene in cinema history.

Ahh...the resolution.  In real life, as I said before, it's boring.  This movie, however, provides the resolution that Ted Kennedy sees in his nightmares.  Brilliant.  I won't ruin it, but the tight directing and believable acting accentuates Bardo's rage against the dying of the light.

Overall, I recommend this for people with mild tempers and no heart conditions.

COMMENTARY
Knowing the case beforehand, I watched the majority with a snarled lip.  Such social apathy really brings out my misanthropy.  This single instance serves as a harsh critical analysis representative of the insidious cultural decay that has wreaked havoc on the community, family, and morals of our society.  It's an overtly sexual, me-first MTV-generation where every child is a precious little snowflake, nobody has respect for family, elders, or authorities, and selfishness all but negates personal accountability.  People like Mallard are deserving of a special place in hell, and the fact that there is no doubt at least one person with sympathy for her only reflects society's decay.  It's sad that the movie ending isn't the real ending, and that vile scum like Mallard are allowed to live, let alone be given the possibility of parole.  With any luck (crossing my fingers), karma will make the rest of her life a horror movie.",1241740800,20,3179,4.937853107344632

The other main character is also sympathetic and makes you want to watch her - at first. However - when tested by the moral challenges posed by having our homeless friend trapped in her car's windshield - the apathy and evil demonstrated by the second character (a young nurses' aide) overwhelm the viewer with pity for Stephen Rhea's character. The film is a wonderful validation of the apathy and selfishness so pervasive in our society.
