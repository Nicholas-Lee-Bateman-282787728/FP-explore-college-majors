8138162,3,B000HC2LQW,"Li Hui or Zee Oui is from China and fought against the Japanese. He suffers from asthma and PTSD. He leaves China and goes to Thailand where he is at the mercy of relatives and the local population that mistreat him. He is pushed to the brink and eventually treats his asthma by consuming the hearts of his victims, typically young girls. There is a female reporter who is also trying to do her job and break stereotypes.

The film is linear. There are no plot twists, it shows you the ending first. Once the killing starts, the film begins to drag on. His remarkable killing spree was failed to be captured by the film.  2 1/2 stars English subtitles.

Parental Guide: Brief rape/nudity. Bloody hearts.",1412553600,,703,4.563492063492063
8138163,3,B000HC2LQW,"A true story from Thailand about a man pushed to his limits in a foreign land. Getting sick one day and not able to get the proper treatment due to the racism that surrounds him, he thinks back of what his mom used to do to help his sickness. He believes that drinking the blood and juice from a human heart will help his illness. Not a bad piece of drama that makes you feel for him even though what he was doing was bad.",1388966400,,422,3.976470588235294
