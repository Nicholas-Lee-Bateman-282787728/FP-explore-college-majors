This opens with a kid ""collecting"" bets for his syndicate boss (Robert Strauss). The kid now an adult ( Steve Cochran) who ends up making $150 a week only now he ""strong arms"" any who weasels.....he is still working for Strauss who shows him a crooks loyalty. Cochran's parents are immigrants who know poverty and his ""salary"" helps give them a better life as well as appeases his ego. When a stoolie turns Cochran in to the cops.... he pulls one year in Prison but is the ""ideal con"" and is soon out. Strauss and Cochran form a ""partnership"" and soon strong arm UNIONS for the mob. Using murder and OR coercion they are soon at the top of their game. Along the way the loyal companion Teresa (LITA MILAN) becomes Cochran's loyal girlfriend/mob bookkeeper. He avoids prison and jail time by simply hiring the best lawyers. When he ""hits"" the mob kingpin Cochran finds even the MOB has rules, and he just ""crossed the line""......Cochran is excellent as the ""kingpin"" who loves the $100 suits, and the ""class"" only his money can buy. VERY low budget but still a fun watch especially if you a Steve Cochran fan also see....Highway 301.",1438300800,,1192,4.622641509433962
