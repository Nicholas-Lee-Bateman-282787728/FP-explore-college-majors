They're said to be urban legend but, knowing the depth that human nature can dive (specially for $), I tend to believe there's some truth in here.

Then, main character, Billy Hughes (Marina Sodina) witnesses what she believes is a real snuff-film being filmed. This leads into a very suspenseful part of the movie that even snagged my short  attention span! Billy is of course the MUTE WITNESS, and her silent screams add tension and horror to the procedings. Her desperate attempts to elude the human monsters on her trail are some of the best I've seen. The scenes in the dilapidated film studio and in Billy's apartment are shot with sadistic perfection! The entire cast is great, with the russian cop being another standout. Fay Ripley is strong as Billy's sister and the only one who seems to believe her story. At times, I was reminded of the movie 8mm. There are also some parallels between this one and FX. However, MUTE WITNESS has enough originality and explosiveness to overcome any similarities!

732961,3,6303926746,"This little thrill-ride managed to slip under the radar upon its initial release.  Boasting memorable sets, an eerie soundtrack, and some truly tense moments, the film concerns a mute make-up artist named Billy Hughes who is working on a slasher flick in Moscow.  After being accidentally locked in the studio one night she stumbles upon what appears to be a porno film in progress.  She soon learns it's much more and the plot just escalates from there.
The first half of the movie is a terrific exercise in edge-of-your-seat tension.  Anthony Waller struggles with the pacing a bit as the film progresses, but there are enough twists and turns thrown in to keep the viewer interested.
The scenes of comic relief with the hapless director and his somewhat more lucid wife are incongruous with the realism of the rest of the film, and should have been omitted in my opinion.
Overall this is a film that is worth renting, but since you'd be hard-pressed to find it in a movie store nowadays, add this one to your collection.  All your friends will think you're so cool!",1187740800,,1068,4.720430107526882
732962,4,6303926746,"This is another i found in Fangorias book of 100 horror films youve never seen. This was REALLY good.

Plot/Setting: Moscow, After a day at the studio with her American filmmakers, a mute makeup effects artist witnesses what she thinks is a murder right before her eyes. After work shes alone in the building and thinking everyone is already gone, she then hears something, creeps around the corner and spies on 2 of the guys making a snuff movie and from there its a big twist and turn type of deal. She is hiding from the killers and running. Just as shes found, one her friends comes to look for her and finds her, and the police come. Then she has to prove to Russian police that it was a real murder,'the killers claimed it was staged' even though she is mute. She soon becomes the target of hired killers and she dosent know who to trust and it also involves some diskettes that were lost that get thrown into the mix. She thinks she can trust this one guy but isn't sure and you start to think if hes really with her or against her. The killers are nuts and cold blooded in this movie. The one wears a mask with a blank expression and a black silk stocking thing over his head. The opening scene had me believing what was going on was real and i was like wow, this is really screwed up. It had plot twists, real scares, horror, suspense and it keeps you on edge until the last scene. Filled with shocks, good acting. I definitely recommend this one. 4.5 stars.

732964,4,6303926746,"""Mute witness"" starts with a very funny take on low budget filmmaking, then offers a horriffic snuff-murder, followed by a cat and mouse game between a witness and the killer in a huge, abandoned building, then does some tiresome B-plot things with a important floppydisc which multiple parties are looking for, then goes for a shoot-out with a twist, and ends, finaly, with a bang.

Okay, for some explanation: a crew of Young Americans is making a slasher movie in Russia. What they don't know is that part of the Russian technicians are using the same sets at night to produce pornografic snuff. Billy, the mute special effects girl, is present by accident, and what follows is a chase through the building complex, which is so extremely well made and done, that even the chase-scenes in ""Dressed to kill"" and ""Se7en"" have to ""snuff it"".

Scene after scene, moment after moment, the killers close in on Billy, and with only her wit she manages to stay ahead. The whole sequence is done with great amount of detail and feel for true suspense and keeps the viewer on the very edge of his seat.

But when Billy is rescued from the bad guys, they track her down to her appartment. And again we're plagued with another hand full of topnotch suspense. Billy takes a quiet bath, and even this innocent scene is so put together and we, as the viewer, hold our breath in vein. And it only gets worse after this.

""Mute witness"" can be put in the same spot as ""Saw"", ""The Evil dead"", ""Cube"", ""Pi"", ""Halloween"" and ""Memento"": all made by an enthusiastic group of young new talent, whose excitements are clearly visable all throughout the movies they made. This new bunch of talent, wit and exictement makes up for half a Great Movie, their craftmanship for the other half.",1152403200,14,1764,4.644230769230769

732966,4,6303926746,"This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.

In fact, it's so nerve-wracking, I haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago, but I will since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to ""escape"" for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else.

The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character in here is a mute. She plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker. After the day's shooting is done and ""Billie"" is about to leave, she hears something. She takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a ""snuff film"" and actually killing someone. Billie's eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse-type building.

There are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out. The first I described above. The second scene, the climactic one, goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first. In fact, the film should have been trimmed a bit but, overall, since it's so good at keeping our attention, then it served its purpose as entertainment.",1145404800,,1338,4.475409836065574
732967,5,6303926746,"With possibly more twists than any other horror/suspense movie in history - including ""Psycho"" and ""Raising Cain"", with possibly its only competion for the rapid twists crown coming from ""Paranoiac"" - ""Mute Witness"" is a wholly original and wholly unpredictable terror thrill ride that demands close attention from the viewer to keep up.

  A small movie crew is on location in Moscow filming a horror movie when a mute girl - a member of the crew - witnesses what appears to be a real murder, possibly connected with some sort of real-life snuff movie outfit operating in the Russian criminal underworld.  The Russian police - made up primarily of former-KGB agents - are called in and, although I'm well aware of the garbage that went down in the years when Stalin et al had the KGB committing their atrocities, the simple fact is that not All of the hundreds of thousands of men and women working in Soviet law enforcement could have been bad, it's statisically impossible, and it's an interesting and refreshing change to see these ex-KGBers presented in the 'good guy' role for a change.  The lead investigator in particular is impressive - both the character and the actor.  Though highly skeptical of the murder account given, he's compassionate with the young girl terrified by what she thinks she saw, totally non-patronizing, and highly efficient.  The actor who plays him impresses hugely because before the movie he apparantly spoke virtually no English and taught himself enough in the few weeks before auditions to not only land the part but to give a tremendous performance, thus fitting in well with the high-caliber jobs done by all the actors and actresses involved.  Speaking of refreshing, although the filmakers are all ardent horror enthusiasts making a horror movie, ""Mute Witness"" does not try for laughs by making them all, er... idiots, to be blunt... because they like horror (i.e. this is not ""Scream"" or similar 'spoof'-fare, which I know a lot of people love but I've never been able to get into).  There Is humor in the movie, but it derives from less feeble sources, and it works, in spite of the intensity of the movie.

  What I've said so far gives a rundown of only the early going of the movie.  There are so many twists and turns that to go further would risk spoiling some of the surprises.  I will say that using a mute character as the lead protagonist works brilliantly, and helps to make ""Mute Witness"" the masterpiece that it is.

733045,3,6303926746,"This film is very light indeed in plot and content. It is centered on the chase of a mute witness in a rather dilapidated and overpiled with all kinds of props and discarded equipment cinema studio in Moscow. The chase of that mute witness by the criminals she has seen performing a snuff-video for some unidentified thug. The only originality of the film is her muteness. She saw, but she can't communicate on the phone or to the police and thus cannot explain what she has seen. And yet the main protagonists of the crime will end up dead or arrested. But no even shallow analysis of the snuff-video business in the world, and this business is not centered on Moscow which is marginal in that field. It is only one piece of the decor. So the film is rather tiresome and boring.

733047,3,6303926746,"For the better part of an hour, Mute Witness is a first-rate thriller. So good, in fact, it was quickly becoming one of my genre favorites. Good premise, great direction, mostly terrific acting, smart writing, this one had it all. That is until just a bit past the one-hour mark, when the film suddenly makes a mind-boggling idiotic decision to change the tone and approach of the material, and it all devolves into a cheesy mess that left a sour taste in my mouth. This is the perfect example of a would-be great film that's merely recommendable thanks to an awful finish.
Billy Hughes (Marina Zudina) is the make-up artist for a cheesy slasher flick being filmed in Russia. A quick intro shows us that she may be mute, but she's pretty good at her job, which she may have also gotten because her sister is married to the director. After shooting for the day is wrapped up, Billy stays behind and is accidentally locked inside the soundstage. Waiting for help to arrive, she stumbles upon two of the film's crew members shooting a porno film, which quickly becomes a snuff piece.
After a fairly amusing opening scene and an effective set-up of the characters, Mute Witness kicks into full throttle quickly. Immediately after Billy witnesses the murder, we get one of the more suspenseful extended setpieces I've ever seen. These fifteen minutes consist of Billy creeping around the soundstage, desperately trying to avoid those crew members she just witnessed. It's a genuine breathtaking, edge-of-the-seat sequence, quite possibly the movie's highlight.
But the fun's not over. A little over halfway through the picture, we get another great stalk-and-slash sequence inside Billy's apartment. You even get to see cutie Marina Zudina fully nude, in some of the more gratuitous bits of flesh baring I've seen in a while (to get the attention of a neighbor, she undoes her robe), not that I'm really complaining. Zudina is probably the best thing about the film, she's smart and likeable, a quick thinker who evades her attackers not because she's physically stronger or faster, but because she's smarter.
(spoilers) While I figured the film couldn't possibly keep the momentum up, I wasn't expecting such a sharp turn of events, either. The film suddenly goes from edgy thriller to a cheesy spy film, packed with silly and predictable double-crosses and plot twists. The simplicity and stark atmosphere of the first hour is gone. The number of villains is bloated from two scary individuals to what is apparently the entire Russian mafia.
The introduction of the undercover cop robs the movie of its key strength. The fun of the plot was watching Billy outthink and outsmart her attackers by herself. Bringing this guy into the mix shoves her into almost a supporting role and virtually reduces her to a mere sidekick/damsel in distress.
Possibly worst of all is the decision to place Billy's sister and her husband into the thick of the action. I don't think I've ever seen such an extreme case of two characters who I initially liked that come to annoy me so much by the climax. These two are made into bumbling fools, they've basically become the film's comic relief. Attempts at humor include them accidentally killing the bad guys, dropping bullets in crucial situations, and generally acting as clumsy as possible but still somehow not getting themselves killed in the process.
Director Anthony Waller had such a firm handle of the movie's pace and tone that I find it hard to believe he'd suddenly undo all his solid work in an instant. But the film's downward spiral is entirely his fault, the man wrote and directed the picture. He should have just stuck with what worked. But the first 2/3's are so much fun, it's worth recommending to thriller fans.",1073347200,4,3760,4.885758998435055
733048,5,6303926746,"As far as directorial debuts are concerned, Anthony Waller's Mute Witness is a very impressive start indeed. It is the type of film that thanks to the boom in DVD market, have been unearthed by the studios from their vault that contains dozens of excellent little films yet waiting to go digital.
A mute American film technician working on a small horror slasher in Moscow accidentally witnesses a 'snuff' movie..this of course leads to edge-of-your-seat chases that are very well filmed, and to the conspiracy behind this gruesome affair, at the centre of which reigns the greatest of them all, Sir Alec Guiness in his last film for cinema before his death (in 2000).
The plot is not flawless of course,(there are just a few, especially in the second half),but the brilliant directing and the development of the plot will more than compensate for that.
Think of Afraid of Dark (the hugely underrated and excellent Brit independant film about a nearly blind boy who also witnesses a murder), and Halloween 2 with its non stop chases down hospital corridors,and you will probably have an idea about Mute Witness. Having said that, it is still an original film (Moscow setting, 'Snuff' movies', Alec Guiness..), and not your average commercial suspense movie the genre and like of which litter the market.

733049,4,6303926746,"This film is a masterly piece of thriller cinema, unique for several reasons.  First, it places a small, young American film crew in Moscow shooting a low-budget independent film--how many movies have that setting?  Second, the protagonist, one of the crew, is a mute woman who serves various functions on the crew: props person, makeup artist, and others--and how many movies have that kind of protagonist?  Third, it is the last appearance of Alec Guiness in a feature film.
The young woman accidentally witnesses a brutal murder by two Russian men of a Russian woman.  The men hear something during the killing and chase her.  What ensues is much more clever than a typical woman-in-jeopardy tale.  The writer-director, Anthony Waller, does a superb job of throwing in unpredictable twists and turns at every bend in the road.  The resolution is excellent and getting there is a whole lot of fun.  It's great to see this top-notch suspense thriller finally coming out on DVD.
Upon release, this received excellent reviews from diverse publications.  Highly recommended.",1057363200,,1072,5.114942528735632
733050,4,6303926746,"Mute Witness is a film that makes me happy that independent filmmakers are still out there working hard to make the best films they can. Although its premise is not that unlike ""Wait Until Dark,"" it winds the whole thing up in a new way to make the suspense even more unnerving.
Don't let the poster art mislead you. There is noone in this film with their lips sewn shut. The ""mute"" in this film is a female special effects expert on a low budget film. Having been born mute but not deaf, she can function almost perfectly in normal society. Of course we know that she is going to be delivered all sorts of frightful things, but what's the big deal? The big deal is she is part of a low budget film company shooting a horror film in Moscow...Russia. What if you were mute and couldn't convey your desires except in sign language?
Our lead (mute) character, Billie, witnesses a murder...and the murderer discovers this fact. The fact that Russia has long been a source of mystery to Americans, and represented a menacing presence to us, makes this suspense film all the more frightening.
With a cast of unknowns, Mute Witness delivers the frights and chills effectively. There isn't a single person who does a bad job of acting. The script is dynamite and so is everything else about this film.

7855881,4,6303926746,"It'a always bugged me that this stylish and artful suspense movie doesn't have a DVD cover that pertains to the movie. The girl on the cover isn't in the film, and at no point in the movie do any of the the characters have their mouths sewn shut. I understand that the image is figurative, but this type of ""stock"" photography isn't necessary for a movie with such rich plot elements and stark, arresting visuals.

That aside, ""Mute Witness"" literally scared the hell out of me one night when I was up late watching TV. I don't want to synopsize the film here, suffice to say that it seems to start out as a black comedy about people making a slasher film, and turns very unexpectedly into a nightmarish movie that is so suspenseful in parts that some of the white-knuckle sequences are literally hard to watch. Not because they were handled in bad taste but because the first half of this movie is so masterfully handled by the ensemble that you feel you really are there and in jeopardy yourself. Having the protagonist be a mute (who can hear) was a genius touch for this genre. She can see everything, she can hear everything, but she can't scream or call for help! Just think of the hideous possibilities! And yet the film makers resist exploiting the more lurid potential of the sometimes highly delicate subject matter, favoring Hitchcock-like use of suspense AS torture.

The result is a minor classic. I guess it would have been asking too much for ""Mute Witness"" to sustain the brilliant atmosphere and perfect timing of it's elaborate set-up. The second half of the film is saved by the convincing performance of Marina Zudina in the lead, and the performances of its equally convincing--and eerily restrained--bad guys. (I hate to point fingers, but it's really the Evan Richards slasher-film director that throws the tone out of whack--he seems to be in a TV sitcom while everyone else is in a big-screen suspense drama.)  As well, there are a few scenes of good-guy-rises up-against-bad-guy carnage that stretch plausibility to the breaking point, with unintentionally (I think) comic results.

""Mute Witness"" remains however--despite some setbacks--a film that none the less entertains til the last shot. It may not fulfill the brilliant promise of its first half, but it's still great fun. And the opening--which is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat (if you don't leave the room!)  should be a subject of study in film classes.",1338336000,,2457,4.799054373522458

7855883,4,6303926746,"Mute Witness (Anthony Waller, 1994)

Interesting little mystery/thriller from Waller (An American Werewolf in Paris), who in his second film crafted something that, while it's faded into obscurity (and wasn't all that well-known even when released) in the fifteen years since it came out, is still a worthwhile thrill ride that you should rediscover, if you like this type of thing.

Mute Witness is the story of Billy Hughes (Russian actress Maria Zudina of Under Northern Lights), a mute makeup artist who communicates with her film crew through her sister Karen (TV actress Fay Ripley, last on the big screen in 2000's The Announcement). The two of them are working on a slasher film being made in Moscow. After a long day of filming, Billy has forgotten something on location. When she goes back to get it, she stumbles upon what looks like a snuff film being made by some of the nastier elements of the crew. They discover her spying and pursue her, but she gets away and comes back with the cops. The crew dismiss it as a good piece of special effects, and it seems everyone's willing to let the matter rest, but Billy suspects her life may be in danger. How to convince both the American portion of the crew and the police that there's a real problem here?

Tense, well-done, and expertly shot, Mute Witness is a perfect film for when you're looking for a good thriller, and one you probably haven't seen before. It's also worth noting that this is the final feature in which Sir Alec Guinness appeared, though Waller shot the footage back in 1985 (for an earlier draft of the movie that was never completed). As with most mysteries of this stripe, there are a few places where it really stretches credibility, and some character decisions that can generously be described as idiotic, but by now we've come to expect that, and you can't count it too much against this.
