8402134,3,B003Q7B7DS,"I thought this was an okay movie it is nothing like I thought and wanted it to be like. I like the story line, but the writing and the way the story happened I was not the pleased. The writing to me was disrespectful to mother's, father's and anyone. I hope this helps If you do want to watch an amazing mystery movie watch Nancy Drew for others, I'm # 4, Beastly, Divergent, Mystery Girls, House bunny, Mean Girls, and Mean girls 2.

8402137,1,B003Q7B7DS,"I watched this with my 7yo daughter. What an incredibly materialistic, superficial and dumb view of humanity. Not a single plot point had any credibility and it's celebration of upper-class gits was galling. Avoid.",1346284800,3,214,5.323529411764706
8402138,5,B003Q7B7DS,"Don't get me wrong, I love the classic Harriet the Spy books. The only complaint is that the character is dark for a children's book.

This movie is more positive and the only thing ""dark"" is that the character's personality is more like cynical than dark.

Good movie! :D",1342224000,,272,4.530612244897959
8402139,4,B003Q7B7DS,"What I Can Tell You:
Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars was a movie on Disney in March of this year. It starred Jennifer Stone of Wizards of Waverly Place, someone I was unfamiliar with until this movie.

The movie is about blogs and bloggers, as if I wouldn't be excited to see this. It paired the competition of High School with the competition of Bloggers. Like we don't compete! You see everyone's Google score on their sites. Harriet and her nemesis have to figure out a way to get the most blog hits. Interesting project their teacher!

I can appreciate the aging of Harriet to 16, I can even appreciate the ""mean girls"" in this adaptation. Unfortunately, I don't think the movie does a good job of enticing kids to watch the movie and then go read the book which in my eyes is a literary classic in children's books.

However, with that said, the movie stands on its own and I believe the demographic (tweens) this movie was made for will love Harriet and pull for her to come out smelling like a rose and getting the coveted spot of class blogger.",1285459200,2,1047,4.414507772020725
