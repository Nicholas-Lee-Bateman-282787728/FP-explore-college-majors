I lost complete interest  after  an hour and turned it off.  Couldnt`t  connect  with  any  of  the  characters.  BLAH,  BLAH,  BLAH",1427241600,,264,5.230769230769231

8094426,2,B000BYRCI8,"I'm staring at my computer screen wondering what to write about this film.  I give it only two stars, but I'm reluctant to call it ""bad.""

I guess it might be described an ""art"" film.  Now I'm no art film maven, but I'm inclined to say that the people who put ""Rain"" together should probably give painting a try, because this film seems less a film than a series of portraits and landscapes all featuring the same menu of subjects, but a bit lacking in something to pull it all together and propel it along.

The dearth of dialogue doesn't help.  It's rare to hear a full sentence from anyone, and rarer still to hear one character reply to something said by another.  And a great deal of what is actually said, always at what seems like a crucial juncture, is spoken in such lifeless tones it's as though the sheer weight of ennui bearing down as if to crush the long-suffering inhabitants of an insignificant little town agonizing through the final days of its death throes in the middle of an infinite nowhere, should, by itself, be enough to convey something profound.  Unfortunately, for me, it really doesn't work.  I mean, I tried.  I paid attention.  I sat through the whole film.  But, for me, it just doesn't work.

In fact, several times, I found myself experiencing that odd phenomenon of driving, wherein one suddenly becomes aware of having been almost in a trance, with no memory of driving the last several miles.

Fortunately, with a DVD, one can replay to see what was missed.

However, one cannot miss the trains.  There are a great many trains in the film, or a few trains making many repeated appearances, at a rate of nearly one train per scene.  And these are the mile-long multiple-locomotive freight trains that roll endlessly through the American mid-west, carrying grain and coal and other bulk commodities.  They roll across haunted prairies, through desolate ghost towns, into and out of sunsets and sunrises, day and night, night and day.

Roll on, majestic wayfarer, say I.  Roll on mighty diesel unit train.  Roll on toward the sea.  Imagine the symbolism.  Then explain it to me.",1263254400,,2112,4.682065217391305
8094427,5,B000BYRCI8,"I watch so many movies that I'm surprised this film didn't come to my attention until now. This is one of those movies that you have to relax and not feel rushed when viewing.  It just kind of seeps into you.  The film feels like poetry.  All parts of this film come together in a hypnotic boil of small town life, love, and tragedy.",1240185600,,333,4.171875
8094428,4,B000BYRCI8,"Katherine Lindberg's directorial debut exhibits her strong talent as a filmmaker, but unfortunately did little to boost her career.  In most critic's eyes, the movie has potential, but ultimately fails to achieve its goals.  I found it to be satisfying; one just has to overlook its main flaws (acting, dialogue, pacing) like any other film.

  Lindberg worked with many newcomers on this film, so the viewer shouldn't expect phenomenal acting on their part.  The film was shot in an authentic midwestern town, using real actors from the area.  Melora Waters, playing the lead character Ellen, is a notable actress previously seen from ""Magnolia,"" and ""Speaking of Sex.""  Her graceful acting guides her fellow cast members as she fits into her character rather well.  There is definately a hint of reality from the film since it was shot on location in a real midwestern town.  This simple convention contributes to the film's already downtrodden atmosphere.

  The film is a deeply personal take on modern values and morality.  It is a story set in a midwestern town with no future and chronicles a series of murder, lies, and secret pasts.  It shares its roots with ancient Greek tragedies and exudes strong Oedipal undertones.  The film drips with the sense that something is off, and this disturbance bubbles and explodes at the film's climax.

  In all, the film is a good viewing.  Presented by Martin Scorcese, it is not for those with short attention spans, nor is it for the weak of stomach.  This modern tragedy is recommended.",1180915200,5,1537,4.949019607843137
