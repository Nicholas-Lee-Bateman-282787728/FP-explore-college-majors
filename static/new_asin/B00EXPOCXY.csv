5949407,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Simply put, the one with Matthew Broderick is the only good Godzilla Movie.  The rest have been cheesy kiddy movies.",1399334400,7,116,4.8
5949408,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Strike 2 USA, leave Godzilla movies to the Japanese.  First off, I'm a huge Godzilla fan as having grown up in the sixties and seventies. I really, really wanted to like this flick.  But almost exactly like the 90's Matthew Broderick one, it's one giant Godzilla-terd.  This movie was so painful to watch, from the very beginning to the very end I was wanting each and every minute of my life back.  I thought maybe I should eject it after the first 10 minutes or so, but decided to put myself through more than 2 hours of pure visual torture and nothing remotely entertaining. Very, very boring, very, very exhausting, nothing at all thrilling, scary or funny, and horrible acting. Wish I spent this time having major dental surgery.

Let me break a few things down: (possible spoilers):

The Cast:  Bad acting and casting...you won't give a rat's ass about a single human being in this movie and whether they live or die.

The Creatures: The ""Muto's"" or whatever they are?  They are just a blend of the Cloverfield monster, the Queen Alien from ""Aliens""  and a Transformer. No life to them as they are very mechanical, just like all those lame ass Transformer movies.

Godzilla:  Is this a Godzilla flick?  If so, his head is too small, his teeth are too small, be breathes blue fire, not red, which burns nothing really.  Worst of all he is too fat and needs to go to the gym (like others have mentioned).  His Roar is even wrong, poor or VERY weak! He can't even kick butt!

Music:  Just another lame copy of some lame superhero movie soundtrack or lame SyFy movie. No originality at all.

The Moviemakers:  They had a recipe for rip-offs:  Take a big cooking pot, put it on a stove and add the following ingredients:
1. Any lame CGI monster like videogame. 2. Jurassic Park (many, many rip-off scenes). 3. Jaws (the Brody name reference among other things). 4. Castaway with Tom Hanks (that's right the train wrecking scene into the water like the plane crash into the ocean in Castaway...also the handheld pocket timepiece.)  5. Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( the kids and guardian reactions, the constant visual on the PC that looks very similar to Devil's Tower).  6. Aliens (The soldiers and high tech combat acting, methods and reactions) 7. The 1990's Matthew Broderick failed USA version 1.0)  I can go on but you get the point...stir it all up and serve as a very uninspiring, very
cold and very poor pot of rip-off soup.

Like Quint said in ""Jaws""  ""I'll never put on a lifejacket again""  Well, I'll never watch this ""Movie"" again.  I have enjoyed monster movies
that have the title of ""A SyFY Original Movie"" better on regular Syfy TV.  That's bad...really bad for me to have to say that.

Finally, I wish I could call this the worst 2 hours I have ever spent on a movie, but as a history buff, I still have worst movie all time as ""Pearl Harbor"" but's that's just me.",1397606400,16,2889,4.544573643410852

5949427,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla is a 2014 monster movie directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Aaron-Taylor Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, and Bryan Cranston. The film was released on May 16, 2014 and was a moderate success, grossing $529 million on a budget of $160 million. Critically, it is pretty much the polar opposite of the 1998 film, getting decent reviews and making lots of money. The general consensus was that not only was it better than the 1998 movie, but that it was one of the better Godzilla films. I do think its better than the 1998 travesty. I might be part of a minority, but Im sorry. Godzilla 2014 is overrated. A bland pretentious movie, and Ill get into why. First of all, I did not give a shit about the characters, except for Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe. Bryan Cranston was easily the best part of the movie, his performance and his scenes, I have nothing but praise for, but he sadly dies halfway through the movie. Ken Watanabe was good, but hes not given much to do, apart from giving exposition and staring in awe at what Godzilla does (which isn't much either). Elizabeth Olsen was a decent actress, but she only appears in a few scenes and is only there to be the love support for the films protagonist, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesnt lead to anything interesting. Aaron Taylor Johnson, I thought he was a poor actor, showing no emotion, and just saying all of his lines flat (hes supposed to be a soldier in the army, I get that, but its a movie, not a documentary, not to mention Ive seen plenty of movies that involve military characters that show emotion, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, for example). The rest of the cast was hit or miss, some better than others. The characters, like I said, apart from Bryan Cranston, I did not find any of these characters interesting. Theyre decently acted (for the most part), but they're written as generic, and uninteresting. I also wasn't a fan of the tone this movie gave off, the film seemed to try making things more realistic. But making a Godzilla movie realistic is like trying to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie realistic, it just doesnt work. And its tone came across as a bit pretentious. It clashed with the realism it was trying to convey of how seriously you can take a monster movie.

Now lets talk about the monsters. First, the MUTOs. I liked them, they had distinct characteristics, and I liked their designs. Godzillas design, on the other hand, is okay at best. Sure, hes a bit on the chubby side, but so is some of the other Godzilla designs out there. I wasn't much of a fan of his roar, though. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner, and not much like Godzilla. Plus he only does 3 things in this movie. 1: He swims. 2: He gets his ass kicked by the MUTOs. And 3: He uses his atomic breath (at the very end) (although his kiss of death is probably one of the greatest scenes in Godzilla history). I generally dislike being portrayed as like a superhero. Although funny enough, one of my favorite Godzilla movies (Godzilla vs Megalon) has Godzilla portrayed as a goody-two shoes. But that movie had a cheesy, fun tone to it. This doesnt. It took the idea of a heroic Godzilla way too seriously. The effects (which are 100% CGI) are a mixed bag. Godzillas and the MUTOs CGI look great. Definitely CGI put to great use. Sadly, the rest of the CGI looked off, especially in the environments that the monsters fight in. Alexandre Desplats score is actually one of my favorite Godzilla scores. I have no complaints for the score whatsoever. But probably the thing that pissed me off the most is that whenever Godzilla and the MUTOs were about to fight. The film would cut away and not show the fights. It was acceptable the first time, but after the 2nd or 3rd time, it was getting annoying. I was fine waiting an hour to show the monsters, as long as everything else grabs our attention, and makes us care for the characters (like Jaws, and Alien). But if the movie had uninteresting characters and a boring plot, then you're going to lose your viewers attention and make them bored.

Now, through all my ranting, you probably think I hate this film, but no. I don't actually, in fact. I was able to sit through it at least 5 times (the first time in the IMAX 3D theater, the 2nd time at my local movie theater, and the rest were either on blu-ray/DVD, or if it aired on TV). But I simply find Godzilla (2014) to be okay at best, and tedious at worst. Its nowhere near being one of the worst Godzilla movies, but its still not one of my favorites either. On a scale of 0 to 10, I give Godzilla (2014) a 6/10. It has its moments, but for the most part, its boring and a bit pretentious. Not a horrible movie, but not great either. Still, Im glad I saw it, and I do kind of recommend it.",1526428800,,4784,4.429057888762769

With that said, there is something about this new incarnation of Godzilla that I really like, he has mostly been portrayed as a good guy, so that is nothing knew, but the modern look and short but great fight scenes were done exceptionally well in my opinion. Much like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park/World, there is something I connect to with these big monsters everyone is afraid of being more good guys than bad, and I can't get enough of it. So I recommend this to anyone thinking about checking it out, even if you don't find it to be 5 stars, it is certainly an entertaining movie for a Saturday night at home.",1518912000,,764,4.34965034965035

There really isn't any story here, nothing new, nothing surprising. Monsters show up, wreck everything, nothing we can do to stop them. Hey, lets use a nuke, what could go wrong.  Most of the battles took place at night. To me, a sign they didn't have much confidence in how their special effects looked. The MUTOs, the evil monsters in this film, looked like they were made of metal, angular - robot looking. And, oh yeah, evidently everyone in the military is an expert at HALO jumps.

And the Lucky Dragon short in the special features is really in bad taste (yeah, ok, I'm taking away another star for that)",1515888000,3,758,4.4855072463768115

The case did come with an upgraded sleeve, which was magically not damaged at all. I opened the case to see that the digital copy of the film expired 09/16/17, two days before I received it. By my guess is that they sent me an older release of the blu-ray even though I paid for the newer one, and just put on a fancy new sleeve.

5949615,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Legendary Pictures' ""Godzilla"" is the second American Godzilla film following TriStar's 1998 entry and the 30th Godzilla film in all. It follows a group called Monarch who track monsters and find the MUTO, a creature long-dormant that feeds on radiation. They also monitor Godzilla in an attempt to study him. The MUTO destroys a Japanese power plant, feeds on the radiation, and begins heading east toward its mate in Nevada. Godzilla, in Hawai'i, attracts the creature as he emits natural radiation. The two travel to San Francisco where they and the third MUTO battle.
This serves as Legendary Pictures' first entry in its MonsterVerse shared cinematic universe. It is not connected to previous Godzilla films, though Ken Watanabe's character, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, draws his name from Ishiro Honda, director of multiple Godzilla films, and Dr. Daisuke Serizawa, the character that killed Godzilla in the original 1954 film. Those who enjoy this and want to follow the cinematic universe should watch ""Kong: Skull Island,"" which serves as a prequel of sorts and focuses on Monarch in the 1970s. The next film following this will be ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" in 2019 in which Godzilla will fight Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. Then, in 2020, Godzilla will fight King Kong in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". This is appropriate for the third film as Godzilla and King Kong fought in the third ever Godzilla film, 1962's ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"".
Unlike other Godzilla films, this one does not have much social commentary. At times, the characters are a little weak and serve to help move the plot along rather than develop as people for the viewer to root for. Despite this, the film is grand and sweeping, of a scale the King of Monsters deserves. Legendary's design for ""Godzilla"" honors the character's history while subtly altering it for the world they portray. Fans of the previous Godzilla films will find plenty to enjoy and this is also a good place for beginners to explore the character.",1503100800,2,1997,5.0

I've been watching Godzilla for 20 years (everything from the black and white to even the cartoon), and all I really like to watch is Godzilla fighting the monsters, so that's what I wanted to see. So out of the whole movie, there's only like 15 minutes of monster fighting and the first fight you think you're going to see... you don't even get to see it?

5949638,5,B00EXPOCXY,"When it's good, it's amazing. The problem in this film is not that the kaiju don't show up often -though they kind of don't, if that's what you are looking for- nor is it the designs of the kaiju, or the story's structure, or the new backstory. The problem, big enough to make all the previously mentioned hiccups feel so much more pronounced is how profoundly, purposefully dull and generic the main character is. He is the most bland character I think I've ever seen in a movie, and it hurts how much time is spent watching him and his equally generic family. Otherwise, all the other characters are perfectly fine, and every second any monster is on screen is great. The deciding factor is whether those segments are good enough to make up for the movie's single serious problem, and that is what you have to consider for yourself. For me, they absolutely are.",1500768000,2,863,4.574193548387097

5949650,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Stephen Spielberg, when he made Jaws, recognized that one of the best ways to build suspense is to not show the shark until near the end of the movie.  The makers of Godzilla thought this was also a good idea, which in the case of such a well-known monster, I'm not sure was the best tactic.  The threat of an attacking monster against Earth, or in this case, two monsters, is not Godzilla but rather two other creatures that hatch and wander about destroying everything they encounter.  There is also a false sense that Bryan Cranston as scientist Joe Brody will lead the action against the monster but that isn't the case.  The real star of the movie is Aaron-Taylor Johnson as Brody's son Ford.  When Godzilla does appear the monster is given little to do except stomp around and roar.  Certainly there are fine action scenes and the expected useless attack by our military, but the entire thrust of the plot keeps requiring Ford Brody to be in the thick of the action, regardless of the fact the action moves through several continents and large cities.  While it's a pleasant enough waste of two hours, one can only hope that the sequel, apparently pitting Godzilla against King Kong, will give us more of Godzilla than we get here.",1500422400,7,1237,4.621004566210046

5949657,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I love monster movies like this and have been a Godzilla fan since I can remember, so I was extremely excited when the movie came out. Some of the scenes in the trailers made it clear this film would have an ominous feel to it, great sound, and great cinematography. It didn't disappoint on those things at all and my first experience with it on the big screen was really good, just not great. I loved the fight scenes and the creatures were cool. Bryan Cranston, for the too-short time he was on the screen, was his usual exceptional actor self. And it is certainly a far cry from the disaster that was the Matthew Broderick movie.

One of the things I was a little disappointed in then and still am today was Godzilla's appearance. I want him to be updated but he just looked heavy to the point of lumbering, and his face was not a Godzilla face at all. He had been re-engineered too much and it wasn't in a streamlined, modernized way - it just look liked he was the couch potato version of Godzilla. I thought and still do even more today that Wantanabe gave one of the dullest performances ever in a movie, especially an action/monster film. And the lead was just not good enough.

However, the first time I saw it when it was in theaters, I was more disappointed with these factors - probably because I had built up the anticipation so much in my head - and they really altered my opinion of the movie. Now, I seem to appreciate all the other great things more and enjoyed it the second time around much better. Things like the atmosphere, the sound (just phenomenal sound in my opinion), a close to the end fight scene that makes Godzilla the coolest monster ever, and even the newer Godzilla roar really add to the experience.",1499558400,,1734,4.415625

Everything was so dark as far as the monsters were concerned, not surprisingly.  They weren't that impressive for me.  The giant metal-looking praying mantis-like things were mostly laughable, IMO. Create a monster more relatable like something closer to something that actually existed at one point in time.

garbage starring Matthew Broderick, this movie delivers!!!!! Some fans may complain about the lack of Godzilla-time in this film compared to the screen-time given to his enemy: M.U.T.O., but I'm not one of those fans.

A movie with monsters, robots, dinosaurs, zombies, and so forth are not going to have the acting chops of a drama movie.

I mean Aaron Taylor did pretty well as QuickSilver in Age of Ultron and as the main dude in Kick Ass, but for some reason in this film he hardly gave much emotion in his voice or facial expressions, like he wasn't really motivated to b a ""serious"" guy.

  Final Verdict a solid Godzilla film done right but could have been a classic. Filmmakers aren't perfect and I love this director but there were parts I was bored waiting for Godzilla. Taylor Johnson lacked the charisma to keep me invested as the lead.",1493078400,,684,4.544715447154472

5949729,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw Godzilla at the I Max when it first came out and I enjoyed it a lot.

It is a Monster Movie it is also Man Vs Beast and Best Vs Beast at its best.

Legendary and Warner Bros brought the rights from Universal for King Kong.

See Kong Skull Island there is an extra scene at end of credits.",1491436800,,294,3.7868852459016393
5949730,3,B00EXPOCXY,"You know, I hated this movie when I first saw it. I ended up buying it on a digital sale at the wife's request, she and my stepdaughter really like it. I still hate it. Just not nearly as badly.

The movie itself isn't really /that/ bad, it's more that it's really, really stupid, and even though it's called ""Godzilla"", it's really just a movie about nuclear roaches.

The movie has a run-time just over 2 hours, but Godzilla is only in it for about 15 minutes.

My favorite thing to do when we've watched it is pretend it's a horror movie about two creatures (The MUTOS), out of time, who wake up totally terrorized and scared, being assaulted by a bunch of crazy little creatures (the humans), all while being stalked by a serial killer (Godzilla).

Drives the girls nuts when I start adding in commentary, but it's about the only way I can handle the movie in totality.

That said, there are some really cool things about it, for instance, though I wasn't initially too thrilled with the revamped 'Zilla warcry, seeing it in theater it sent adrenal surges through me. Watching it for the first time since I went to the early release, when the sound system cranked that bass-y scream out I got the same feeling again. It's done very well.

Godzilla looks amazing, I know the Japanese called him ""Fat-zilla"" and whatnot when the movie came out, but he looks intimidating, and by far the best he's ever looked. When you finally get to see him in action at the end, it's done very well, if over-dramatic in execution.

I was really underwhelmed with the his breath weapon, the nuclear fire should have been far more explosive, it rolls out like liquid, which I guess is appropriate if you're into plasma physics, but if you're that into science you're already losing your mind by this point in the film as it's all so non-plausible... And by that I don't mean the ""Derp, clearly it's non-plausible there are monster! Dummy!"" kind of non-plausible, I mean it like ""there are science fiction movies that try, and there are others that don't, this one doesn't, so why bother trying to make the nuclear breath ""quasi-realistic""?"" kind of non-plausible.

It's a small gripe if you're not a Godzilla fan, but I honestly to own every one of his toho films on VHS, I grew up on Godzilla as a kid thanks to the UT Austin's ""Monster Cinema"" runs on the local college channel growing up. Every Saturday I watched a 4 hour block of Godzilla, Rodan, Gamora and gang's antics while doing chores around the house.

If you still haven't seen the film, and you're wondering if you should finally check it out given the sequel is going to get an insane amount of hype by proxy of the roster... It breaks down like this.

If you're a big time Zilla fan, you've likely already seen this, but if you haven't or you're thinking about revisiting it, go ahead, it can't hurt, just don't expect much. There is no monster brawl here, so if you're considering watching it again and really on the fence, just go to youtube and watch the last 20 minutes again. If you haven't seen it, you probably should.

If you're not really a long time Zilla fan, then this is probably a much better movie. In the same way that the second and third Star Trek movies are much better movies if you weren't /really/ a star trek fan. So I'd definitely say ""go ahead"", especially if you're considering seeing the sequel.",1491436800,,3373,4.53125

5949751,5,B00EXPOCXY,"This version of Godzilla is my favorite. I loved the human aspect alongside the monsters. The characters are all genuinely good people, who only wants to protect mankind. They make mistakes in their attempts, but they never give up. Godzilla and the MUTOs were great to watch as they travel and fight, but I do wish there was more action showing them in battle. The artistic look of the film is beautiful and makes everything so gritty and in a sense very real. In my opinion, it is the best monster movie I have ever seen.

The history of the monsters, while some details only lead to more questions for me, was a great addition. I hope more Godzilla movies come out like this one that follows what I feel is the true nature of the beast. Godzilla is for balance, not the total annihilation of man. If that was the case, we'd all be dead already...in the movies, that is (LOL).",1489881600,5,878,4.419753086419753

5949774,4,B00EXPOCXY,"This film evokes both ""Cloverfield"" and ""Jurassic World"".  The visual effects are stunning, which comes as no surprise given the director's experience in this field.  The score and sound overall is impressive and keeps pace with the storyline.  As with most effects-driven movies, the plot is simple but entertaining.  Since the monsters are the main draw, the cast is not given too much to work with but still does an admirable job, with one exception.  Action films generally don't require strong main characters but the better ones usually feature a spirited hero or heroine that the audience can identify with on some level.  In this area, the movie falters.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson reacts to nearly everything the same way a person would if he found out that the local Dunkin' Donuts was no longer carrying a coffee flavor he never liked anyway.  Was this the director's intention?  A miscast?  Whatever the case may be, Taylor-Johnson's blas performance does real harm to the film.  Still, the film's merits outweigh its faults.

Of course, Godzilla does emerge later in the film as you would expect.  Obviously, the graphics are better than in some older films.  I like that the ""monsters"" are not changed completely.  They really are what you would expect from a Godzilla film.  The ending of the movie is not unexpected completely, and I do like the way they handle Godzilla himself at the conclusion of the film.  My children have watched this.  The older one tends to be a little scary in general, and he didn't particularly care for it.

5949884,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Garbage.  A waste of a good cast. Bryan Cranston can't act his way out of a wet paper bag here, and Juliette Bincohe might as well have been a coat stand. And the weepy mom, the stoic ""EOD"" guy, all forgettable. I wish the film was literally darker, because it was actually dark, And was that Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn slumming for a paycheck?? Worst film I've seen in a loong time. Kudos to the hack that directed this. I was enthralled the whole time! I loved this ""movie"" Somehow, strangely satisfying. But make no mistake, this is not Cinema.
This is what my stoner friends would call a ""Saturday Night Popcorn Flick"", and indeed it was. If all films were as bad and serious as this we'd all be richer for it. If this is his Godzilla, his new ""Star Wars"" entry is going to be box office gold. Thank you, Universe, for making somebody that made a B-movie with absolutely zero humor. I wish all movies were this terrible. This guy should be on Woody Allen's speed dial, cuz that guy is a true hack.
Woody Allen couldn't make a movie like this if you held a teenage Korean girl to his face. (he's sickening)
This guy makes Roland Emmerich look like an amateur, and he had to deal with Will Smith.

5949911,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I have been a massive G-Fan since I was eight-years-old,
so I was very excited about this remake no. 2!
I was really let down by the ID4- crew's remake of the big guy
back in 1998, but this one really did well... for the most part!
What I liked was:
1. Godzilla was everything he should have been:
  a. Indestructible!
  b. Breathed radioactive fire!
  c. Fought-off other very nasty monsters!
2. The CGI work was amazing!
3. The MUTOs were both cool and scary!
4. Most of the human characters were great.
5. The focus of the movie was on the monsters.
6. The suspense was great!

What I didn't like was:
1. They kept trying to use nuclear weapons on the creatures,
but Ken Watanabe kept telling them that they they should let
them fight with Godzilla. The military was acting kinda stupid
with that... Lol
2. They kept cutting away when Godzilla and the MUTO creatures
where about to fight! Until the end that is... That kind of annoyed me.

Overall, it was fantastic experience to watch a U.S. movie
studio get the world's most famous monster right for once!
Lol! I highly recommend this movie to any G-Fan or fans of
giant monster movies!

5949962,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw this movie at the theater and again on TV yesterday. So I can't comment on the quality of the DVD or Blu-ray versions.

Generally I thought the scenes were a little too dark.

I also wasn't crazy about the design of the bad monsters. They look more like robots to me but they are supposed to be biological animals.

It's still well worth watching but not one of my all time favorite Godzilla movies. Those are probably Godzilla 2000 and Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah.

5950010,3,B00EXPOCXY,"See the movie only for the special effects and you might be happy with it, because they are quite good.  Otherwise, it's a real throwback to some of the problems women have been pointing to for years in movies:  killing off, or ""fridging"" the woman early on just to give the male lead a story arc (grrr...Godzilla raises the stakes by fridging Juliette Binoche!, an Oscar winner!  She could have been used for so many better things!)  This leaves us really with only a couple of women:  a worried wife (snooze) who comes into peril later (of course) and an assistant (surprised they gave us that much).

Standard blah-blah action hero movie with one dude doing basically all the work by himself because he's soooo great and heroic.  Have not we seen that movie 100,000 times over?  Must we always cater everything to teen boys?  Weren't we all made implicit promises when we heard Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche were cast?

Poor Ken Watanabe, brought in to make the film seem more multicultural, spends most of his time with brows furrowed while spouting nonsense about how Godzilla will save us from the other monsters because he's nature's instrument to create balance.  Hate to break it to that scientist, but if Godzilla were there to bring balance back to nature, human kind would be rightfully screwed.  He must be in the 3% of scientists we keep hearing about who don't believe in anthropogenic climate change.

I never mind Godzilla being the good guy (I'll always have a soft spot for him myself) but the whole point of the original Godzilla movies was to remind humans of the long-lasting devastation we've caused on the planet.  This movie had none of that nuance and honestly no real point.  Just sit back and smile when Godzilla plows throw a building, because that is all we're offered here.",1477958400,,1810,4.738019169329074
5950011,3,B00EXPOCXY,"It was OK, but the version with Matthew Broderick is still my all time favorite.  The one thing I did like about this edition is the fact that Godzilla was the protagonist, rather than the villain.  The version I like was left open-ended w/ 1 egg left & starting to hatch.  I've been waiting all these years for a sequel.  I would've preferred that to this new one.",1477872000,,365,4.323529411764706

The acting was good enough to be enjoyed by someone who may have missed out on the old ones as well.  The themes of man/science vs nature are present as in the old ones.

I understand that this was essentially supposed to be an art film with limited sequences of Godzilla action to focus on characters and the monster's affect of them, and use filming techniques to capture the resulting suspense, but it is genuinely horrible. Godzilla is on screen for less than 10% of this 2 hour + movie (the original only runs about 90 minutes, making this technique brilliant) and you can barely see him when he is.

What marred the film for me was the way the human hero repeatedly comes face-to-face with the giant kaiju ""bad guys,"" time and again being in mortal danger only to somehow be saved at the penultimate moment. He's in trucks that roll over, monorails that get trashed, dropped off high bridges into shallow water, caught in massive explosions, threatened with being eaten at extreme close range -- and always comes out of it tired and slightly bruised but fully battle-ready for his next unlikely encounter. Okay, so he ends up limping and using one crutch at the very end of the movie, but c'mon! The willing suspension of disbelief that movies of this type require got twisted & nearly broken by the obvious impossibility of this guy's ongoing repeat encounters despite an attempt at making everything in the film super-realistic. (BTW, if you've ever been to a certain airport you'll immediately realize the monorail is totally fictional.)

The other big problem for me was that we are introduced to the real (human) hero -- at least as an adult -- well after the movie has begun, while the person who seems to be set up as the main character is unceremoniously killed off almost as an afterthought about 20% of the way in. Not only did this just seem strange, it left me wondering which seemingly major character would be killed off next, thus making the unlikeliness of the hero's surviving repeated monster encounters even more grating. (It also left me wondering about how many different screenplays & writers it took to create this film, getting in the way of just watching the action.)

A smaller problem was that I ended up wondering just how big Godzilla and the MUTOs really were. They're always big, but their exact scale (despite some specific measurements being blurted out by various characters onscreen) seems fluid. This is most noticeable when Godzilla creates a devastating tsunami just by getting out of the water in Hawaii, but just gentle (albeit large) ripples when he lowers his entire bulk into San Francisco Bay later on; he also seems to be as large as an aircraft carrier -- no, wait, he's a lot longer than the carrier -- no, wait, he's just half again as large as that cruiser over there... in various scenes.

The script also seems to play fast and loose with abilities of the kaiju. The two worst such examples are the sudden death of the male MUTO (slammed into a building for the umpteenth time and fatally impaled on the same wreckage he'd been impervious to throughout the movie until then), and the long build-up to Godzilla's first use of atomic fire breath vs. its nearly instantaneous availability minutes later despite his being obviously exhausted by the long fight with the MUTOs.

Oh, yeah -- and why do away with Godzilla's signature sound? He roars very convincingly, but just doesn't sound like himself.

On the redeeming side, this movie IS eye candy. Not only are the effects well-done, some of the basic imagery is actually beautiful. Most notable in this regard is the HALO jump into San Francisco (set to the same odd, haunting vocals as the end of ""2001"") -- the scene where the jumpers emerge from the clouds with their trailing red smoke streams resembles a painting.  I also have to admit the aforementioned long build-up to Godzilla's first use of atomic fire breath was a scene I replayed several times; the slow rise of blue glow from the tip of his tail up through the plates on Big G's back, ""followed"" by a deep, slowly-rising base note actually garnered an ""oh, yeah, here it comes"" chuckle from me.

Overall, I'll watch this film again IF it becomes free under Amazon Prime; it was fun for my eyes but the inconsistencies and broken logic of the script were enough to make it a one-time rental only.",1473292800,,3876,4.72189349112426

5950179,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Coming 16 years after Roland Emmerich's nearly-universally disliked Godzilla, this new adaptation is a notch above, though still deeply flawed. The original Japanese classic Gojirra acted as a kind of cautionary tale of the dangers of nuclear weapons in post-Hiroshima Japan, and while this film has some of that trepidation at the prospect of widespread nuclear power, the U.S. Navy participated heavily in the making of this film and are largely presented as the heroes of this story; there is an American jingoism here that is antithetical to the intent of the original Japanese film. I can enjoy films with ideological bents that are not my own if they're done well, but this was simply too average for me to reality connect with.

Brian Cranston gives a characteristically strong and believable performance as Joe Brody, a nuclear power plant inspector who is convinced that recent explosions and radiation leaks are not earthquakes (as the media has been reporting), but are the work of a monster. (There are similarities to the way that these radiation leaks are presented that eerily recalls the tragic Fukushima meltdown that happened in 2011.) While the militaristic overtones of the film are pure western fantasy, the film does have some brief, sharp, and slightly subversive commentary on the media's role in manipulating the public on key world events. Its not exactly Network, but this part of the film did work.

As Brody's wife Sandra, Juliette Binoche gives a fine performance and the two of them do their best to elevate a by-the-numbers script. On the other hand, Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays their son Ford, and he gives a stiff and wooden performance (which seems to be his MO). He's miscast and he drags the film down when he's onscreen. (Elizabeth Olson does the best she can in a thankless role as his wife.) The ever-reliable David Straithern delivers a brief, yet solid performance as an admiral (who wants the public to believe it's an earthquake, despite his knowledge that it's something entirely different), but two key scientists (played by Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) are buried deep in the mix, with throwaway parts that are not worthy of their considerable talents.

I'm so tired of seeing action movies conclude in New York or Los Angeles, and I enjoyed seeing San Francisco be the location for the final set-pieces (full disclosure: I live very close to there). Though nobody else probably cares about this, my hometown of Livermore (famous for its nuclear lab) gets a shout-out at one point, and that drew cheers in my theater, though it's probably telling that the crowd never got more excited by the film than when it merely referenced our geography.

The special effects throughout the film are strong and blend in seamlessly to the live action elements, which helped to make up for some shortcomings. Just as Steven Spielberg did in Jaws, the film wisely avoids the monster until the second act, allowing a decent amount of suspense to be built up; Godzillas presence lingers over the entire film, even when he is not in it, though nowhere near as effectively as the original film did.

The film follows the disaster film formula to a T, and while its reasonably entertaining, its also very slight and a little bloated (they could have easily lost 20 minutes). A scene towards the end where two characters hide on top of a bridge as Godzilla roams about the city is truly scary, and there are brief, but genuine moments of terror. This is not a great film, but it's worth watching, largely because of the strong special effects, the occasional social commentary, and the performances of actors who are not Aaron Taylor-Johnson.",1470355200,,3670,4.932038834951456

Bryan Cranston and Taylor-Johnson's acting were top notch and made there characters very enjoyable to watch. Though her character was less prominent, Elizabeth Olsen did a very superb job as well. Ken Wantanabe was also great. The parts with Godzilla were spectacular, the music was wonderful, and the special effects were top notch.

If you're intending on it BEING a Godzilla movie in a continuing mythology, then you'd do better to feature more of the monster. It's not lost on me that he gets as much screen time in this entry as he does in the original movie, that argument has been made a few times...but if you're trying to make the times he IS on screen more impactful and memorable (as they were) and pushing the upsell of the ""here's how it could be plausible in real life"" side of the story, then you need to bolster the human-drama element with leads we would actually have to give a damn about, and not place said lead(s) in an endless stream of deus ex machina just to keep things moving. Cranston and Binoche were criminally wasted as characters and Watanabe reduced to jaw agape stares and one pivotal quote.

5950298,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Gareth Edward's GODZILLA is a well-directed, handsome and reverent take on the kaiju classic. The performances are strong across-the-board, but the lead character (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) lacks the charisma needed to carry a blockbuster film. Bryan Cranston is a stand-out, but his role is far too brief. Scene-to-scene, the direction is as good as any kaiju film I've seen. The staging of each big ""wow"" moment is on-point, but the film comes apart as a whole. The plot relies heavily on coincidence as the the main character and the monsters miraculously show up in the same place at the same time more than enough times to stretch credulity. The movie also has significant pacing issues. One or two more action ""beats"" earlier in the movie would've made a world of difference, and the title character just does not get enough screen time.

Still, it's a largely entertaining movie with some some great moments and striking images. It's definitely worth renting if you're at all interested (and if you have a big-screen TV).",1464480000,2,1024,4.988304093567251

5950315,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw this movie when it was released and I absolutely HATED it! Most of the trailers I saw led me to believe that Godzilla would be the cause of all the destruction I was seeing in them. In other words, I thought it would pretty much be a remake of the original movie and I'm thinking great! With the CGI effects this would be the best remake ever! Much to my disappointment he ends up being the savior of mankind AGAIN (against two electric cockroaches no less)! Many things in this movie just didn't make sense. It's a Godzilla movie,but it takes forever for him to show. He is a prehistoric MONSTER, when he first appeared in '54 (according to this movie) they did everything they could do to kill him,even using nuclear weapons. But he has absolutely no animosity against mankind! And the cheese factor in this clunker is astounding. When he has finally defeated the cockroaches and he wakes up after passing out for the SECOND time, he lumbers into the ocean while everyone is cheering for him! And on the TV screen of one of the news broadcasts covering the event they have the caption ""Godzilla,King of the Monsters"". I felt like hurling. In the original ""Gojira"" he was basically a man in a rubber suit,but that version had a good plot. The 2014 version had all these top notch special effects but one of the weakest storylines ever! A BIG THUMBS DOWN ON THIS TURKEY.(And who the HELL designed this Godzilla?

5950442,1,B00EXPOCXY,"When I saw this (twice) in theaters in 2014, I felt it was one of the very best Godzilla movies ever. I still feel that way -- about the movie itself, to which I would give a solid five stars. I do not feel that way about this DVD, which came as a Godzilla-sized disappointment. Never would I have expected so recent a movie to have suffered such grievous cuts in its authorized DVD release! Gone are many, perhaps most, of the strategizing sessions, including one of my favorite scenes, in which an old scientist theorizes that this time Godzilla might be the solution. Did whoever committed these cuts think the DVD was aimed strictly at an audience that wanted nothing but nonstop action all the way? But in that case, why cut the whole Las Vegas episode? Along with the authorities' efforts to track the M.U.T.O.s across ocean and continent toward each other? Why cut most of tracking Godzilla across the Pacific? And why include such long ""action"" sequences set at night or underground, too dark to see anything except in occasional flashes, and often with almost nothing to hear except the soundtrack music? -- a technique that can be effective in small doses, but is here taken to such lengths that it grows simply confusing and boring. I do not remember being either confused or bored while watching the version released to the theaters in 2014, and the daylight scenes seemed bright enough on my player.
  The ""bonus features"" disk has three short ones of interest, along with several considerably longer ones which seem (I didn't make it all the way through them) to be the filmmakers boasting about how well they did this movie. I would heartily agree with them -- of the movie I saw in theaters in 2014. NOT of this mutilated DVD version. The disk with the movie itself kicks off with several trailers of other films which look to me singularly uninteresting; and I could not find any way to get past them at once to the main menu.
  Authorized or not, this DVD is a rip-off. If you haven't seen the full version of this  movie as released to theaters in 2014, please DON'T base your opinion on this DVD, which is at best half a suggestion. I sincerely hope this is not the vrsion aired on TV. Is the half-baked idea to double sales by paving the way to an ""uncut"" DVD? Dangerous, since it is more likely to kill than stimulate interest; and, meanwhile, seems an open invitation to pirate copies of the Real Thing.",1455753600,2,2426,4.567816091954023

5950465,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I would honestly rather watch the 1998 movie than this.

Godzilla movies should be pretty easy to make. All you need is some humorously bad acting, and a guy in a monster suit crushing miniatures. For some reason, directors from the US continue to destroy what was once an incredible, classic and beloved big screen monster.

As soon as I heard about this movie, (back in 2009) I was very excited. Unfortunately, that excitement turned into utter disappointment and sheer hatred. There are so many problems with this film, so where do I begin?

1. Would it be to much to ask to get some practical effects in there? The entire movie looked like it was performed in front of a green screen, and the CG was nothing spectacular.

2. What the hell is a MUTO? What was wrong with just having Godzilla in the movie? I thought this was a reboot, not a sequel!

3. Not only did Godzilla look terrible, but YOU BARELY EVEN SEE HIM IN THE FILM! Believe it or not, several of the shots from the trailer are COMPLETELY CUT from the movie. The movie IS called ""Godzilla"", correct? Then where the hell is he?

This was my biggest problem with this movie. I'm not kidding when I say that only about 10 minutes of this 122 minute crap-fest show Godzilla. Give me a freakin' break.

4. Oh and the story? It's garbage. From what I've gathered, two monsters called MUTO's want to meet up in the middle of San Deigo and have sex. And I guess Godzilla doesn't like that. Also, there are some lame human characters. That's it. I'm not kidding.

What the hell kind of story is that? Is Zilla jealous that he can't get laid or something? What's the point? Also, did I really need to see such a detailed shot of a gooey egg-sack hanging off one of the MUTO's?

This film was so bad, I nearly sold ALL of my Godzilla merchandise that i've collected over the years. This film made me HATE Godzilla.
I honestly haven't watched a single Godzilla movie since I saw this film in the theatre.

Not only did this movie prove once again that the US just can't get a Godzilla film right, but it destroyed my once strong love for the franchise. I can't hear the word Godzilla without cringing. I wish there was someway I could go back in time and stop myself from seeing this movie.

And to any and all people who like this movie, you guys are losers. This is NOT Godzilla. This is overproduced, overhyped, wannabe garbage.
In fact, anyone who likes this movie is NOT a real Godzilla fan.

After this film, I pronounce my retirement from the world of Godzilla Fans. Thanks for ruining the franchise forever, Thomas Tull. Go to hell!",1454544000,2,2595,4.428571428571429

As someone born and raised in Hawaii, surrounded by different cultures, I grew up with the Godzilla shows and movies on tv (no cable or dish back then). I own all the Originals on dvd and the kids enjoy watching then as well.

This movie is a different version of Godzilla, not a remake of the series or the film with Matthew Broderick.

Same creature different story kept me entertained throughout the film with the monster action as well as the human drama elements intertwined to produce a spectacular movie.

5950500,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and son live in
the suburbs of Tokyo.  On one particular morning, an earthquake-like disaster
hits the power plant where both Brody and his wife work.  As the plant begins to
suffer a meltdown, Brody attempts to save his wife but ultimately has to sacrifice
her to save everyone else.  Grief stricken, he spends the next 15 years attempting to
find answers to how the accident occurred, believing it was not due to natural causes.

The film jumps 15 years ahead as we find Brody's grown son, Ford  (Arron
Taylor-Johnson) living in San Francisco with his wife (Elizabeth Olson) and their
young boy.  When Ford receives a disturbing phone call, he returns to Japan to find
his estranged father still investigating the circumstances surrounding the nuclear accident.
This leads both father and son to discover an insect-like creature with giant wings
(nicknamed MUTO) which has hatched itself from the earth's innards.  And wouldn't you
know it, there's not just one MUTO...but two.  As the creatures make their way towards
San Francisco, its mating call awakens Godzilla, the mightiest monster of them all, who
mankind is depending upon to fight and destroy the MUTO duo.

Godzilla looks as good as expected in 1080p.  Though dark most of the time (which
may be a problem for some plasmas), there is much detail revealed in the transfer.
Colors are mostly muted, giving the film a very natural and realistic look.  Blacks look
inky and there are no digital artifacts to be seen anywhere. An excellent transfer all around.

The problem with spending the extra money to buy this 3D Blu-ray combo is that this
is yet another post conversion effort that does very little to enhance the overall viewing
experience.  Level of separation varies throughout the film.  For instance, I felt that there
was very little background/foreground separation during the first half. While the intensity
improves in the second half, I still felt that the overall amount of depth looked quite tame
compared to the stellar efforts of Pacific Rim (one of the best post-converted films ever
made).  Overhead shots are perhaps the most impressive looking facet of the 3D
enhancement, but for the most part, doesn't make this film a better watch.  There is
no pop-out to be seen other than a brief moment where the nose of a warhead seems to
poke itself forward.

I saw absolutely no hints of ghosting.

I suppose the biggest thing this transfer has going for itself is its 7.1 mix designed by
Erik Aadahl (Transformers: Dark of the Moon).  This is a highly aggressive track that
brings out the roars of military equipment, and floor-shaking LFE rumblings caused by
tremors.  Having recently upgraded my equipment to 7.1, I was again astounded by
the manner in which the additional rear channels fill sound gaps in providing added
support for crashing, crumbling structural debris and various weather elements.  With
excellent panning and directionals, this soundtrack sounds larger than life and one
that will become a ""reference"" disc in your library.

Godzilla arrives as a 3-disc (Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD + Digital HD) combo housed
with lenticular cardboard packaging.  Extras include a declassified look at the cover-up
to keep Godzilla's existence a secret by the MONARCH corporation.  There is also a
behind-the-scenes look at the feature with the cast and filmmakers.

Consider me unimpressed on most all levels.  I found Godzilla to be poorly paced,
awfully miscast, and as a result, a tedious viewing experience.  Even the film's star
gets reduced to a mere cameo appearance making it a bit of a letdown to its fans.
The addition of 3D is mostly pointless, does nothing to enhance the viewing experience
and gets hindered somewhat by many dark scenes that further reduce the already
weak levels of separation.

My advice is to save your money and opt for the 2D release instead.",1453075200,,3924,4.976993865030675

5950515,1,B00EXPOCXY,So bad it's not worthy of a review.,1452556800,,35,3.5
5950516,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Let's get this part out of the way, yes, there is only about 10 minutes of Godzilla screen time in this movie. This isn't as bad as it sounds, as a lot can happen in ten minutes of a movie. You can see what the director was going for with this less is more approach. Every second of Godzilla in this film was great and he definitely didn't overstay his welcome or get boring after a while. However, I do believe it was taken a little too far. Godzilla doesn't show up until after the first hour of the movie, which is pretty normal. When he does show up, there is an excellent build up to the big reveal. But once things are about to get really interesting, it cuts away to another scene and we only see it on a TV for a few seconds. This happens 2 or 3 more times throughout the movie until finally, the last twenty minutes has a good amount of Godzilla vs MUTO action. Unfortunately, even then the battle moves along rather fast and when Godzilla defeats his opponents, I felt more of a sense of ""oh, its over? Already?"" rather than ""Yes! After a long struggle Godzilla finally came out on top!"". This is because although Godzilla does fight with the MUTOs for a pretty long time, we really don't see much of it, and when we do, it moves along a little too fast for it to be satisfying. I'd say, ten more minutes of Godzilla throughout the movie would have been just enough to accomplish the director's less is more goal, while still offering a satisfying amount of Godzilla in the movie.

Despite the lack of Godzilla in the film, I do have to say it is an overall good movie for what it is (a giant monster film). And to be honest, the little amount of Godzilla we had was of way better quality than pretty much all of the Godzilla movies before it. This movie has very good CG effects, and does Godzilla a lot more justice than a man in a rubber suit ever could. Don't get me wrong, I always thought the Godzilla costumes looked great, especially in the later films when the costume designs looked better. Its just that the movement of Godzilla in those movies was very limited, and sometimes it was hard for them to maintain the illusion that the creature was supposed to be enormous. Many times the feet would look more like barney feet that enormous monster feet smashing down on the street below. And many shots mainly consisted of Godzilla walking in a straight line while roaring, over, and over, and over until Godzilla's iconic roar started to get annoying. Not to mention all of the silly stuff like aliens, fairies and time travelers that took away for the main plot of two giant beasts fighting in a large city. This movie may not have a lot of Godzilla, but when we do see him, he fights fierce, he looks updated but still like the classic Godzilla, and he looks huge. Of course, there are the fans who will always believe that the Japanese Godzilla will always be superior even if he's done with a sock puppet, but for me, this Godzilla stomps on every previous Godzilla film, with the exception of the '54 one, though that film is very dated now.

As far as the acting is concerned, the actors/actresses do a great job, though the aren't given much to do in this film. Bryan Cranson's character is the most well developed character in the film, the best acted and the most interesting, but unfortunately he is way under used, and the film mainly consists of a cast of pretty boring characters who serve to be there just so we can see the carnage through there eyes. This isn't new in a Godzilla film and is much more easily forgivable than in most other films as the giant monsters are the main attraction here, but the first act of the film shows a lot of potential for a giant monster film that actually has characters we can care about.

Overall, I do think this may be one of the best Godzilla films to date, with great effects, pretty realistic monsters (about as realistic as giant monsters can be), and a pretty well written story that is much easier to take seriously than a lot of the previous films. Considering this was Gareth Edwards first theatrical film, it was directed very well, with a lot of low angle shots that truly brought out the scale of these creatures. I hope the back lash from the fans is enough for him to learn his lesson so that we may see more of Godzilla in the next film. But in the end, the lack of Godzilla and interesting characters does not hold this movie back to much from being on of, if not the best giant monster film, and Godzilla film, to date (in my opinion).",1452556800,,4524,4.35781990521327

5950534,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla is the massive, sweeping sci-fi action epic from director Gareth Edwards, and the second American-produced remake. This time around, the lead and supporting writers sought out to do the King of Monsters justice by sticking with his roots in how the big guy Gojira is an old, ancient monster. After scientists accidentally release creatures upon the world through ignorance and curiosity, the King emerges to fight these beasts before our world is destroyed. With a brilliant cast featuring veteran actors Bryan Cranston, Ken Wantanabe and David Strathairn, as well as Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, Godzilla is a welcome return for the King.

Director Gareth Edwards directed this massive blockbuster after doing only one other film before, a sci-fi drama called Monsters, which boasted brilliant visual effects, cinematography, and real human emotion and drama amidst a terrifying ordeal involving giant alien squid-like creatures that could represent some Kaiju-like creatures Godzilla faced in the original Japanese productions. So, with his love for the genre and technical know-how, Edwards brought a certain respect and care to this remake other directors would have left out, but it's in the writing where the film lacks that ""human"" touch Edwards had in his first film. Written mainly by Max Borenstein (Frank Darabont added the largest human element with Bryan Cranston's character), Godzilla suffers from true emotional investment in the characters. Now, I'm not saying there's nothing there, but there should have been more, and things should have been different. Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody, the father of Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). His character and performance brought an unbelievable gravity to a movie that would have just been a fun and wild ride, making more of a brilliant film than an entertaining blockbuster. But, his character wasn't given much screen time, and when he was off-screen, the ""human element"" was boiled down to the relationship between Ford Brody and Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen), which was convincing because of their performances, but it wasn't enough. The visual effects were top-notch, with the action sequences looking both terrifying and epic. Alexandre Desplat's score was loud, bold and extremely haunting (though, I'm still confused by the negativity surrounding it, because it was supposed to be loud), and the production was stunning.

Now, the movie obviously isn't for everyone, but it is still a glorious and awesome spectacle that deserves to be seen. While the biggest issue was the lack of emotional attachment to the characters outside Cranston (hopefully Edwards' proposed Director's Cut is released to correct that), Godzilla is still a big, epic action blockbuster that accomplishes the impossible; by being a note-worthy and well-deserved remake after the '98 flop from Roland Emmerich.",1451779200,,2876,5.46067415730337

5950573,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Decent movie but not like the Showa ear, IMO. I may be bias, though since I grew up with the movies from that era. I think if you get too serious with making Godzilla a realistic movie like somehow it may happen then it could become silly in a negative way instead of a fun way. The older movies Godzilla is more like a WWE wrestler with almost a human personality (he's outright anthropomorphic) in some of his Showa flicks. This is a main reason people connect with him. In this movie he's basically a giant radioactive lizard with not much personality.

The movie was entertaining despite this even though Godzilla doesn't have much screen time. About as much as the original movie from 1954 from what I've heard. The cut aways can be annoying though, this was also done in the original like the scene where Godzilla is fighting MUTO on TV in the original Godzilla is shown destroying the city on TV. I understand this may have been for dramatic effect for the build up to the final battle and
 to develop some character among the humans but at the end of the day people want to see Godzilla bash monsters and trample buildings and there's really no surprise in the revealing of a character who's been around for 60 years.

My biggest gripe with the movie is that it's very dark. I don't mean dark figuratively but dark literally. It's very hard to see a lot of what is going on especially during the final battle scenes. I was hoping maybe it would be lighten up a little on the Blu Ray but it's not. Not on the regular DVD either.",1450742400,,1535,4.397887323943662

I've had my flat screen for 4 years and never had a problem seeing what's doing on in dark scenes. That's in something like 3k of viewing hours. This film is the first where I really have a hard time seeing what's going on in the night. This is especially problematic in the last battle scene between our good guy monster and the two villain monsters. I had no trouble withe the final battle in the theater, which leads me to believe that this blu ray was mis-mastered for disk.

P.S. I just finished watching Pacific Rim, also full of giant monsters attacking at night. And I had no problem seeing what was going on. There's definitely something screwed up about this transfer to Blu Ray.",1448668800,,902,4.395209580838324

Also, the human characters were....pointless. They were just time-fillers. The only person who did anything was the main character who burned the eggs in the MOTUS nest. Aside from that, all the humans did was come up with a plan to kill the creatures, and than spend the next hour of screen time trying to abort the plan to be back at square one.",1448409600,,739,4.323741007194244

When we finally see a radioactive monster it isn't Godzilla at all, it's some other flying creature that sort of looks like Mothra from the old original Godzilla movie's.  Most of the movie is dark with little details as we wait for Godzilla.  Finally after Honolulu is destroyed we get a glimpse of Godzilla as he gets a Navy escort to the West Coast and San Francisco.  They fumble around for awhile so the other two monsters can destroy much of San Francisco, until Godzilla appears in all his glory and put's an end to the wanna be monsters. Godzilla then rests up after the battle before waking and making his way back to the ocean so we can have yet another Godzilla movie later on.

5950660,2,B00EXPOCXY,"RECOMMEND AGAINST THE DVD, THE MASTERING IS HORRIBLE AND BLOCKING IS EVERYWHERE ON THE SPECIAL FEATURES.  But aside from that----

I found this movie disappointing, even going in not expecting much.

While I pretty much showed up to see giant monster stuff, and the giant monster stuff in this movie was pretty awesome, the shots are really dark, so it's hard to see anything if you're watching this in a room with lights.  The choice of actors was very confusing as the script apparently expected the two most boring characters to be interesting and fun to watch in close ups, but they had zero chemistry and I didn't really care what happened to them.

If you showed up like me for Godzilla, you're probably not going to have a good time. Be ready for the movie to cut away to the most boring lead actors in the world for dull reaction shots that chop up and interrupt the moderately uncreative monster battles.  And be ready to be disappointed by a lackluster ending that doesn't make sense with the movie's internal logic and what is shown and said, and for Godzilla not to be in the movie very much.

On a positive note, the character designs were great, and I feel like this movie could've been solid if it were a prequel to Pacific Rim and had better human protagonists and focused more on the monster stuff.

Basically everything in the plot is cool to think about in retrospect, which underscores that the cause of the problems is likely disappointing performances by some of the key cast members.  All the older actors and extras did a good job, but the younger leads were not particularly fun to watch and the way the movie was cut underscored their shortcomings.  Possibly if you were a 17-25 white male with blond hair and blue eyes like the lead and could see some of yourself in his physical characteristics, rather than having to depend solely on the performance, it would be a solid choice for casting, but it would need another viewer to test this.  I couldn't find a female character in the movie who could be a role model, with the few present constantly being interrupted or ignored by other characters, which I felt was pretty weak for a movie made more than 60 years after the 1950s.

Setting aside all the human stuff, the special effects were good, and the character animators for the kaiju managed to convey a good amount of feeling into their part of the project, which was sad because the movie kept cutting away from their work to people it was difficult to care about in the way the script needed for the shot sequences to be emotionally effective.

I'd say its not all bad if it were a few dollars, but its not really worth it for a price in two digits, especially the badly done DVD.  If you have already seen Pacific Rim it might be entertaining for its novelty, but I'm not sure it's as good as even Son of Godzilla overall.  At least that one had a decent ending and some legit (uninterrupted) monster fights.  The effects are nice, but they're interrupted too often to be as impressive as they should be.

The plot resolution didn't make sense based on the setup, so it might be better to watch this while making out with someone you like rather than actually paying attention to the movie.  That way the ending won't be a confusing mess, but would instead just be a mess.  -MZ",1446163200,,3313,4.519262981574539

5950678,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Where is Godzilla in ""Godzilla""? Oh look, he's there for all of 5-10 minutes in a 2 hour film, mostly obscured by smoke, water, doors, and a television screen.

I have no idea what the fanboys of this movie are talking about. Critics of the film didn't want ""subtle plot"", or ""deep characters""? We just wanted a total, non-stop action film? Seriously? It's not all or nothing. ""Godzilla being in the movie 95% of time"" and ""Godzilla being in the movie 5%"" were not the only two approaches to take.

The primary problem I have with this film is a massive failure to properly utilize its biggest assets. If you haven't yet, please take a chance to look at a few of Godzilla trailers. They heavily emphasized Godzilla, Bryan Cranston, and Ken Watanabe. They promised an exciting plot driven by deep characters within the context of impending disaster.

So imagine my surprise when Bryan Cranston is insta-gibbed in the first 10-20 minutes of the film. Imagine my surprise as Cranston's in-film son, Ford Brody (had to look that name up), becomes the primary protagonist in the film. Imagine my surprise at the military's only anti-monster strategy (""the plot essentially) being ""nuke 'em"" by transporting the nukes right by the monsters that eat them (& Godzilla at least is shown to have been 100% resistant to previous nukes). Imagine my surprise when only thing Ken Watanabe really does is give 1 good one-liner (""let them fight"").

Imagine my sense of impending disaster as the first contact between Godzilla and the MUTO (enemy monster) lasts all of ~10 seconds (~15 if you count the brief scrap shown on a television in the film). What do you get instead? Well, you can be ""thrilled & scared"" by Ford, uh .... Brody saving a nameless boy from falling out of a train. Sooooo deep. What character. What plot. Because we all came to see Godzilla because of the bland actor portraying every generic ""good-guy"" ever.

& this repeats and repeats throughout most of the rest of the film. No Godzilla for you audience, feast your eyes on the ""heroics"" of Ford, uh ... whatever as he: tells his family to stay in a city about to be attacked by 3 gigantic monsters before being subsequently nuked so he can play hero (& his wife actually takes this advice by handing her kid over to someone else so she can stay in the city), fails to actually disarm previously mentioned nuke, and tries to dispose of a nuke that is about to go off by sticking it on a boat to put out to sea (though the nuke apparently never goes off because...reasons).

Fortunately, the final fight lives up to the hype. It's just that the movie needed that sort of action in other places in the movie. Not everywhere, Godzilla 2014 fanboys, but somewhere else other than just in the end. If you want to focus on the human perspective, please actually use the wealth of  acting talent you have (Cranston & Watanabe), not the utterly unremarkable actors playing dumb and equally bland characters. Otherwise, please just give us more Godzilla next time - it would have made up for everything else.

In the end, Godzilla 2014 goes for a scary disaster-thriller from the human perspective instead of basking in all the glory of Godzilla, and ends up giving the audience neither. Its only saving grace is that the little bit of Godzilla that was shown was awesome.

I have no idea how anyone thought the film had subtle plot or deep characters - must be so subtle and deep that I, a common person, can't see it at all. I certainly wasn't scared or emotionally involved in the film - Ford whoever, his wife, and the entire human race could have all died a painful nuclear death for all I cared. The plot of nuking nuke-eating/nuke-resistant monsters wasn't creative or calculated.",1445731200,,3737,4.667173252279635

Fortunately the Director chooses to make this movie about people - while Godzilla's actions and prescence remain a bit of an enigma in his sporadic appearances in the film.

While I understand the complaint, the hate is utterly and totally unwarranted. Why? Godzilla's appearance in the background of his films is not an abnormality, but a normality. It's not about the monster, it's about the chaos he unleashes. Furthermore, some Godzilla films are not even about Godzilla. The film Godzilla vs. Megalon is more about his battle partner, the robot Jet Jaguar. At the heart of this film, is a very human story, one not often explored in some of the older Japanese films, and I applaud director Gareth Edwards for the Spielbergian feel he brings to the film. My greatest frustration is that the same people who bash the film most likely skipped out on the more action-packed Pacific Rim. Having said that, I loved this movie. Is it the greatest Godzilla film ever made? No. Should Godzilla have had more screen time. Probably. The difference is that the monster himself is brought to justice in ways that can hopefully destroy the memory of Roland Emmerich's crapfest back in 1998. If your not able to enjoy Godzilla for the core elements of the franchise and what makes this series unique, you may not be a fan at all, and should probably stick your obsession of Bayformers or what-have-you.

Pacific rim is a much better movie and the DTS Master audio track is almost as Good as Godzilla's. If you are debating as to whether you should purchase the Blu ray or rent via streaming, I would say it depends on whether you have a surround sound system or not.

I cheered, screamed, laughed, cried, clapped during the fight scene - couldn't help it.  It is soooo good.  Mr. Taylor-Johnson did a first rate job, too.  I am a Godzilla fan from back in the day so I was aware of some of those earlier references of Godzilla in this 2014 version. The reviewers here all referenced that and it was obvious.  Mr. Edwards knows his monsters.  And, yes, new fans won't be tuned in to that so they will have to go and check out the original movie plus a few sequels.

5950839,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Special effects were atrocious, very simple plot, but kept me entertained throughout for the most part. I won't spoil anything, but the ending was very disappointing as well.",1437696000,2,174,5.25
5950840,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Fans of Godzilla can breathe a fiery, toxic sigh of relief.  Gareth Edwards deftly pulls off a super-sized monster movie with a slow burn beginning and a slam dunk ending.  He even manages to somewhat rationalize the origin of a 300-ft tall monster and gives him a purpose for that existence that ties into Godzillas original Japanese origins as a beast created from mankinds nuclear foolhardiness.

To those critics who are moaning about lack of depth in the human element, I need to remind them that this is a Godzilla movie.  In giant monster movies, people exist for two reasons only: exposition and scale.  Here, they serve that purpose quite nicely.  Edwards pulls in a game cast including award winners Juliet Binoche and Bryan Cranston, both of whom are extracted from the proceedings before being completely reduced to gape-mouthed monster toe jam, which is what most people are bound to be.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a bombs expert is given plenty of action but little personality, and Elizabeth Olsen as his wife has far too little to do other than fret.  However, the human context securely in place, the movie shifts its focus almost entirely to Godzilla and the new scourge of the earth, giant insectile spawners dubbed MUTOs.

I'm really not going to expound on specifics to the story.  Were talking giant monsters here.  There are coverups, there is fear, there is destruction, and the special effects deliver.  Arguably, Godzilla and his enemies cause far more destruction to Japan, Hawaii, Las Vegas and San Francisco than Superman or the Avengers did to New York City, so theres another thing to stop carping about.  These are films of destruction on a massive scale.  Even Michael Bay (director of Transformers and other loud explosive movies) and Roland Emmerich (director royale of big destruction from Independence Day to 2012) are shaking their heads and saying wow to the level of chaos the King of Monsters and his tag-team enemies bring here.

The only distraction of the story is the convenience of a plot where the mother and father (Cranston and Binoche) both work at the nuclear facility which wakens the MUTOs; and their son becomes a bomb-diffusing special forces expert whose skills and tenacity drive the second half of the movie; his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) is also conveniently a nurse, which keeps us in the thick of the wounded human element.  There is the obligatory dog on a chain bit and the obligatory kid in peril subplot that seems tacked-in.  Otherwise, its a solid romp with seamless effects and a winning payoff.

CLICHES:  The imperiled lone dog, the imperiled lone kid, the contrivance of an entire family with a front-row seat to Godzillas story arc
SURPRISES: This is the hugest, most massive Godzilla ever.  We will not see a King Kong vs. Godzilla remake with this Godzilla design, because Godzilla would crush him like a bug.
WAIT FOR IT: A boffo opening weekend quickly saw an announced sequel retaining Gareth Edwards as director

YOU ALSO LIKEY:  Pacific Rim, available on VOD;  warning, older Godzilla movies with the sole exception of the original 1954 film are generally of the whacky and humorous variety; widely available on Netflix
BUT TRY THIS: Monsters, a quietly suspenseful and atmospheric large-monster movie that is the reverse of Godzilla; concentrating almost solely on the human characters and only revealing the (surprisingly beautiful) monster encounter at the end.  This was Gareth Edwards debut and the reason he got to tackle the big G.  Available on Netflix.",1437609600,2,3540,4.989778534923339
5950841,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie; as a long-time Godzilla fan I had plenty of trepidation, though. Old, respected franchises are often driven into the ground when Hollywood is desperate to re-energize them for the sake of profit. The trailers were all very mysterious and I purposely avoided reading critical reviews to stay unbiased.

That having been said, I enjoyed this movie. It was far from perfect; the acting was mostly mediocre. It was not bad enough to detract from enjoyment of the movie but no-one really added any creative spark to the material; they're all just going through the motions and trying to look serious. It's also rather slow-paced. Even putting aside criticism of Godzilla's limited screentime and the lengthy wait before he appears onscreen, the story takes a long time to develop and since the characters are pretty nondescript all anyone really wants to see is Godzilla smashing everything in sight. This movie demands patience,

For anyone who has a little patience the rewards are worth it. The story is treated with both care and respect for the franchise and yet it takes the backstory of Godzilla in a new direction, a direction that (shockingly) fits well within the tradition and allows a great deal of freedom for the writers. The themes are subtle; perhaps a bit too subtle as I feel many people seem to be missing them. I thought the movie centered around a respect for a higher power, whatever it might be, and that no matter how far our science and technology comes there will always be things beyond us. The real selling point of this movie, though, is the monster presence. The new Godzilla design, while not my favorite of all the looks, fits his origins better and feels perhaps the most primeval of all the designs. Everything form his movement to his roars to his radioactive breath...it might have broken the tradition considerably but it all felt legitimate. Similarly, the MUTO creatures make for an odd but highly enjoyable new entry in the long catalog of Godzilla-franchise monsters. Arguably more eye-catching then even Godzilla, the MUTO steal the scenes they're in thanks to a great look, presence and unique abilities. Lastly, people really need to quit complaining about Godzilla's screentime. Any Godzilla fan who's seen their share of Godzilla movies knows that Godzilla rarely has as much screentime as we'd like; the ones who complain are probably just whiners who also complain about Michael Bay movies and yet still go to see them.

In the end, while this movie lacks the humor and more engaging pace of the Roland Emmerich Godzilla this one is the one for faithful Godzilla fans. I'm very loyal to the traditional Godzilla movies and this one makes for a great addition to my collection. Definitely recommended.",1437609600,,2795,4.8924050632911396

The 2nd disc contains a few nice special features, although not really that many, considering it has a entire disc to devote to them. But what really disappointed me was that there was NO director's commentary. There are only a few films that I would rewatch with this feature, but this is certainly one of them. I own The Godzilla Collection, which features 8 complete Godzilla films with commentary on the English language versions by select Godzilla fans, which I found most enjoyable. So I was really looking forward to Gareth Edward's complete commentary for this film and was very disappointed when I didn't find it.

Ideally, my rating should be 5-Stars for the film, 2-Stars for the absence of commentary, but I'll just let a more than generous 4-Stars suffice.",1437609600,,880,4.7894736842105265

This movie might have continued the tradition of scientist as hero, dating from It Came From Outer Space and Creature from the Black Lagoon, and continuing through Jurassic Park. This would have been a much better movie.

Unfortunately these two characters were phased out early in the story, and their son turned out to be the main character. Instead of a smart scientist, he's a dumb warrior. Instead of Sam Neill and Laura Dern, we got Rocky Balboa.

I blame James Cameron. Working class people are the heroes in his Terminator movies and Aliens and The Abyss and Avatar. The theme of his movie Titanic was that working class people are better in every way than upper class people.",1437264000,2,824,4.836879432624113

5950885,4,B00EXPOCXY,My views are mixed on this one. The Godzilla stuff is great. The fights are terrifying. I love how they built to them and just gave glimpses of the monsters.

Nothing against Aaron Taylor Johnson, but if I wanted to watch a movie about an American Soldier having a really bad week, trying to get home, there's a lot of other movies for that. I'm watching Godzilla, because I want to see cities stomped by Monsters, and hear that iconic roar.
It's not a BAD Godzilla movie ( the Matthew Broderick Godzilla from 1998, more Jurassic park than Godzilla), but there was too much Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch ( Since Taylor-Johnson and Olsen were reunited in Avengers:Age of Ultron), and not enough of the monsters. The Next Movie due in 2018 promises to be better on that front!",1436400000,5,696,4.658536585365853

5950900,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I was nothing but excited for this movie to come out, being a life long Godzilla fan i had many expectations in the back of my head such as.
1. How will Godzilla look?
2. How cool will the Muto be?
3. Will it be better than the 98 one?
4. Am i gonna feel dumb watching it?

To be fair, i was half happy half not so happy with the movie. In my opinion they seemed to bill the movie up as if Godzilla is causing all this destruction when most of the time he's not there... Yes i said it Godzilla is there for about 5% of the movie. While that could be cool because they obviously want to build up his new look. but a lot of the teases left a bad taste in my mouth as they kept happening after the monsters have already been shown. The acting is another problem i have, i know Godzilla movies aren't known for acting but at least have someone we could care about... Aaron Taylor Johnson played more of a cyborg than a father/husband trying to get home to his wife and kid. He was very hard to care about compared to some of the original characters in the Japanese films.

I saw this movie twice in the theaters and have watched it a few times on DVD now so i've had plenty of time to pick out what was good and bad. Do i reccomand it? Sure it's not completly awful. Do i think it should be your first Godzilla film? I'd stick to the originals.",1436227200,,1340,3.996268656716418
5950901,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Described this to my sister who is not emotionally invested in movies about huge monsters as ""a show where Brian Cranston plays a science type dude who experiences personal tragedy, starts breaking laws, and alienates his family"" and she was like, ""Oh you are into Breaking Bad now, lets watch it together and get you started."" Then I pull out the Godzilla box and she was all like ""I am not emotionally invested in this"". Anyway if you like seeing an endless montage of epic monster shots without too much whining from the puny humans scurrying around the city shooting at them occasionally with small arms (wtf? really?) then this is your movie. The Rembrandt of Godzilla movies, heavy use of chiaroscuro shadow and dust effect to imply massive presences even when not directly visible, also tends to be a little more formal and posed than more expressive styles.",1436140800,,865,4.8120805369127515

Stupid mistakes:
1. Attacking aircraft fly close to the creature & get swatted out of the air. No need to get within reach of the creature. All the weapons used had an effective range of over a mile.
2. Creature's electro megnetic pulse (EMP) disabling military aircraft/equipment. Military electronics are ""hardened"" against EMP so they're not disabled by the EMP of a nuclear weapon detention.
3. Nuclear warheads called for but entire missile is transported by train. The fleet following Godzilla has nuclear warheads in it's arsenal. No need to transport across California for the creatures to steal.
4. Arming the nuclear warhead while still tied up at the dock instead waiting until out to sea in the target area.",1434326400,,795,4.940298507462686

5950980,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Once upon a time, the world was finished fighting with itself and scared of America's new weapon. It should also be remembered that the United States of America fueled the economy of the post-war world for decades. We LOANED money in huge amounts to our ENEMIES because we could afford to do that. (the fact that they ALL OWE US HUGE debts has nothing to do with this version of Godzilla). Godzilla was Japan's answer to two, different disasters. One was nature, the other was entirely man-made. Earth-quakes and tsunamis are NORMAL occurances and events for Japan. (no, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were neither of those things). But i think the reason this story does not evoke the same emotions as BEFORE, is because the disaster we face today ~seemingly greater even than natural ones, is our own, violent, frightened species. This is why a new, improved Godzilla does not resonate with us ~even though the story here is very well constructed and we have every reason to care about all of the people in this story as it unfolds. Kenji Watanabe is perfect as the natural scientist and Alan Kranston as the heartbroken nuclear reactor operator who loses his wife to Godzilla's first appearance (10 years before, as the story goes...) It's well-told, and there's lots of action for everyone. Classic, popular Sci-Fi cinema is an escape, and that should be what you want when you watch this. Do not look for meaning, or environmental 'awareness' ( please ), unless you want to appear foolish. Remember, a single, volcanic eruption like Mt. Saint Helens does more damage than mankind. This is a fact of life on earth. Stories like Godzilla are our way of admitting this simple fact.",1433894400,2,1675,4.819444444444445

The movie was half over when he finally made an appearance. I hope in the next movie he fights Monster Zero/King Gidra.

""Where??"" ""Where is it?"" ""Where do you put all of your nuclear waste!"" ""Nevada!""

Well, you get the point.

Terrible movie, terrible script, really bad acting with the one exception of Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, who does wonders with the lame, clich lines he's been given.

I'm surprised anyone likes this movie, then again... There's no shortage of stupid people in the world. There's also a significant possibility that a lot of the positive reviews you're reading are from people paid to write positive reviews for it - people who may be working for the company who made the film...

5951031,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Novice director Gareth Edwards hasn't reinvented the wheel.  But he did dare to suggest that it was flat and set about changing it in the dark, at night, with a dying flashlight his only source of illumination.  If you can't see what's happening, then nothing is happening but sound and confusion.  I love the exchange made by one of the characters in an early pitch dark scene, ""Guys!  You've got to see this!""  If only we could.
We have the most famous monster in all of creation and the poor fellow ends up a special guest star in his own film, lucky they allowed him the few minutes he got, seen as bits and pieces, rarely in his full glory.  Even the cover art on the DVD pictures the big fellow lumbering away, back turned, indifferent to everything around him.

The plot was not unlike the opening credits with its rapid dissemination of flickering images made irrelevant by their brevity.  The story is a sprawling muddled mess that mainly concerns a single family that begins with Bryan Cranston as the ill-fated Joe Brody and his son Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his family.  Both are affected in entirely different ways by the not so sudden appearance of monsters.  As usual, the military has only the one idea for dealing with them while the few scientists involved have a differing opinion.  It's a moot point when Godzilla finally takes over.  Pity he thought to do all the fighting at night.  The results are as expected.

I was initially disappointed but switched to a begrudging acceptance that this was as good as it was going to get.  Ultimately, it was my fondness for Godzilla that allowed me to at least like this film to a degree.  And because I paid so much for it, I'm keeping it!",1431388800,2,1714,4.5704918032786885

Nukes literally vaporize everything, whether or not it ""feeds"" on ratiation.  Nukes dissolve everything and anything, including radiation loving reptiles.

5951077,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Many reviews talk about how this movie was made for true Godzilla fans - people who have seen all the movies, know every version of the story, and can probably name every director who ever attempted to bring Godzilla to the big screen. I'm not one of those people. This is the first and only Godzilla movie I have ever seen, and I have to say I really liked it!

To be totally honest, the only thing I knew of Godzilla was something about a giant lizard (?) - and I think I even had him a little mixed up with King Kong. I don't generally watch monster movies, and I haven't been too impressed with all the other loud, CGI-fests I've seen lately (Transformers, Pacific Rim, etc.). So I went into this expecting to be disappointed...and was pleasantly surprised!

The BEST thing about this movie isn't Godzilla or the special effects (which are excellent, by the way). The BEST thing about this movie is that it has what so many other movies are missing today: the human element. I loved that children played such a prominent role in this movie, and that the movie was more about family relationships than it was about a monster destroying a city. I loved the little boy on the train Ford's reaction to him. I liked that family and relationships were echoed throughout the movie, from the pocket watch to the Ford reassuring his son that he would ""be there in the morning."" Even the military characters were less ""soldier"" types and more ""human"" - with actual compassion and realistic reactions.

I watched one of the special features where the director talked about how he wanted every shot to be seen as if we are actually watching things happen in real time, from the viewpoint of real people. So we see Godzilla through rainy car windows, we see his giant foot as it stomps by a coffee shop. Personally, I thought that was an excellent way to build suspense and keep things interesting. Instead of watching the monster, I was watching the characters as they dealt with the monsters. That's what separated this movie from all the other 'blockbusters' - it was character driven rather than two hours of just mindless destruction.

If you're like me and tend to like BBC dramas a lot more than loud action movies, give this one a try. It's intelligent and well-written, especially considering the WWII connection and the history behind the making of Godzilla. The special effects are top notch (no ""rag doll' people) and the soundtrack was particularly well done. I'd give this movie a solid 4 1/2 stars - definitely one I will be adding to my collection (much to my surprise!).",1429660800,,2578,4.622270742358078

5951104,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Overall, I really, really liked this movie, despite some quibbles with it. I am going to get one of the first quibbles out of the way. While I liked the story and the MUTOs looked great and were excellent monsters, I think my slight disappointment with the movie was over what could have been. The 2012 Comic-Con teaser showed us a Godzilla with a quote by Robert Oppenheimer that was reminiscent of the 1954 original and Gareth Edwards had said he was going to bring Godzilla back to his roots....but in the end he didn't. Now I knew that going into the film that he didn't make a movie similar to the 1954 original. Its just after seeing this movie I really would have loved to have seen a movie with a malevolent Godzilla. Instead, what we get is a Godzilla that was prevalent during the Heisei era and some of the Millennium movies: a Godzilla that is a force of nature but also the anti-hero. I like those types of movies too, its just that with all the modern CGI and special effects it would have been nice to have gotten a story in the spirit and tome of the original. The tone of this film is serious but it still has the air of a summer popcorn movie. It isn't too dark and serious but it is a good old fashioned giant monster movie.

With that out of the way, one of my other concerns was over the fact that I had heard Godzilla doesn't have  a lot of screen time. That was my biggest worry. Although I love the movie Cloverfield I was disappointed in the amount of screen time that monster got and I feared the same for Godzilla. My worst fears were not realized. While Godzilla doesn't have the screen time he has in some of his movies it isn't as bad as some people report. Sure, I would like to have seen him more but what we do see of him in the movie is well worth it. I also loved the design of the MUTOs. They very reminiscent of the Colverfield monster, a design I really love. To see Godzilla and the MUTOs in life-like CGI is the best part of the movie for me. Yes, the MUTOs do have more screen time than Godzilla but that doesn't bother me at all.

When Godzilla and the MUTOs are on the screen both together and separately not an inch of film is wasted. They are all money shots. Meaning, they all look spectacular. Some more spectacular than others. When the male MUTO arrives in San Francisco and greets the much larger female MUTO through the clouds and smoke that is an impressive sight. Equally impressive is when Godzilla rises about the two buildings and lets out a snort. The monster battles are epic in scope and detail. This does not look like men in rubber suits!

I don't know what I expected.

There were 3 moments I was beating the remote against my head at the stupidity of it:
*SPOILER ALERT* (which I'm just trying to spare you the pain)

First Face Palm:
When they dropped off the Navy Seals in a jungle to find a lost Submarine, which after walking about 100 ft and finding the back end with the huge propeller it zooms out to show the 3 helicopters circling the OBVIOUSLY TALLER THAN THE TREES HUGE SUB.

Second Face Palm:
When they go to Nevada to check on the monster they locked up years ago in a mountain bunker. The marines are dropped of via helicopter (again) and kick down the Bunker door. only to see HALF THE MOUNTAIN BLOWN OUT and the HUGE monster heading towards the city THEY JUST CAME FROM. Oh and pulling out some binoculars for some stupid reason.

Third Face Palm:
When the tugboat going about 5-15 MPH carrying a nuke passes the Golden Gate Bridge by about 100 yards, with like 3 minutes left on the timer, a magical helicopter picks our ""hero"" up and clears the blast radius of a NUKE safely without the least turbulence.

I don't think even MST3K could save this.",1427673600,2,1300,4.351239669421488

5951146,3,B00EXPOCXY,"In a lot of ways the Roland Emmerich Godzilla is an exhibit of '90s popular cinema, for better and for worse, and I think we'll feel the same about this one in about ten years' time. It's dark, gritty and menacing, often to a fault. The screen is awash with grays and browns. The important CG moments are impressive and generally perform well, but they're still quite obviously digital set pieces and feel unnatural. I did find a lot more to appreciate in the tone of this one than in its 1998 cousin, which wears a strong admiration of the Toho source material on its sleeve. In terms of focus, this could've passed for one of Japan's own: the screen spends far more time hovering around the human components than the monster himself, who's largely relegated to a cameo role. Those civilians are universal retreads, though, only vaguely interesting at their best moments. For the most part it's a very bland movie, slogging through a repetitive plot that had me checking my watch on the regular. The monster fisticuffs are cool, even if the impact of familiar skylines being toppled has lost some edge in the wake of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Avengers, but even those are often tossed aside as afterthoughts. I lost count of how many times the screen cut away just as the king of monsters got his paws on an equally-oversized freak. Clearly it was a conscious decision to keep our perspective with the huddled masses, but that makes for a tough contradiction; artistic, yes; rewarding, no. The HALO jump seen in an early teaser trailer is probably the only thing I'll remember in a few months. Much less enthusiastic a revival than I was hoping for.",1427673600,2,1658,4.642857142857143

5951164,5,B00EXPOCXY,"The MetalPak itself is awesome.  Godzilla's embossed tail wraps around the book, and there is a little button on the upper left-hand corner that makes a roaring sound.  The picture shows the book with the J-card on so, the top half is all black after the J-card is removed.  As a final note, the MetalPak is glossy.  I have a friend that hates them glossy, but I don't mind glossy or flat as long as they look good.

  As for the film itself, Many expected what we have been getting from the latest monster movies.  Lots of scenes showing the monster up close and fighting and destroying and smashing.  What we got was an old school format where we only get a glimpse of the monster to add to the suspense.  Saving the big fight scene for the climax.  What we also got was a character based story with actual character growth.  This movie was definitely made for the Godzilla fans.  If you love Godzilla, you'll love this.  If you don't like it, strap yourself to a chair and watch three hours of the power rangers, then watch Godzilla again.

Spoiler Alert!!!  If you have not seen the movie please do not read this.  It was Godzilla who destroyed the Golden Gate Bridge.  Why is everyone rooting for him.  And, and...  Godzilla should have let the MUTOs eat all the nukes.  The world really doesn't need them.  Those soulless weapons developers can dream up other weapons that aren't so... devastatingly evil.  Oh well, it was just a movie.  I can only dream of MUTO's devouring all the nukes.  Also, that MUTO killed dude's mom by accidentality.  Sorry she had to pass away, but they should not have had the nuke plant in the first place.  There are plenty of alternate power sources.  Why those brainiacs don't make a multi-source plant, which multiplies the normal output is beyond me.  That's simple science.",1426896000,2,1814,4.56386292834891

5951168,3,B00EXPOCXY,"The quality from Amazon is good, but the movie itself is a little dumb. The characters you're really drawn to end up being secondary characters that don't get much screen time, and every time there looks like there's about to be an awesome monster battle... the camera moves away and focuses on someone running, screaming, or a door closing. If you want to see the monsters fighting and kicking butt, watch Pacific Rim. You'll also get giant robots, a couple of kick butt women fighters, the Newt/Hermann dynamic, and hot guys with their shirts off.

Still, Godzilla is a monster movie icon, so you might want to watch this at least once. Though I will admit that while the movie was playing, nearly everyone else left the room out of boredom and I ended up fast-forwarding past some of the more boring bits (about 1/2 of the movie). It makes me feel a bit bad for Godzilla and the ruin of his movie career. At least this time he wasn't having babies like in Godzilla 1998, so that's something. And the Mothra character in this movie? They make sure to mention like a dozen times that it ISN'T Mothra (I was disappointed about that).",1426809600,3,1133,4.553921568627451

5951188,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Very poor lighting throughout the entire film. The music is subpar and sounds generic when you even notice it. As for being a Godzilla film... The namesake monster is really only given cameos throughout the whole movie and any scenes where you think you'll finally see his action are quickly displaced by other scenes, darkness, or put on in-film television screens. In reality, this movie is more of a poorly written military sci-fi movie with little action and no respect for the title's monster. Any time you do see Godzilla for any ""extended"" period he seems exhausted and is constantly falling over for no reason which leads to more of the banal military scenes that don't hold their own weight against the two hour wait to get to the credits. The special effects were good when you could actually see what was happening (the film dares the audience to view most of it as a ""fill-in-the-blank"" experience), though one scene in particular made Godzilla look more like a yard ornament for Christmas than King of the Monsters.",1426550400,10,1028,4.813559322033898

There's two monsters. The tradition is in tact with this film. Godzilla is the best kind of folk hero. He is a dinosaur, so he cannot go out of style.

5951283,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw this movie in theaters with my brother and we were both so excited during the very beginning scenes. The progression of the movie slowly made us loath what was happening before our very eyes. They do a serious buildup for the first monster scene and, as soon as it begins, they cut to another scene and let you watch part of the fight on a television set! I am glad that some people like things like that, but I just don't find it appealing. I go to a movie called Godzilla to watch monster action. But that's okay, a movie can be good and not just be about action scenes-I certainly don't appreciate transformer-type pics, but I just never got into the story and never felt any love for the main characters. The role of the military was so pasty and predictable- that would be fine it this was like a regular Godzilla movie, but this movie tries to be realistic with the military-I didn't like how the male lead was somehow always in the right place at the right time. It comes off as insulting that the humans do all kinds of unrealistic last second miracles like navigating through a city that is being ripped apart and skydiving into a city with almost no visibility when they could be giving us unrealistic monster action in a movie called Godzilla.

 I am one of those people who have been a lifelong Godzilla fan-anytime there was a Godzilla marathon on tv, I would spend my entire day watching and loving them. I like the goofy ones and I relish the darker ones (like the original).

5951342,2,B00EXPOCXY,"While worlds better than the 1998 debacle that I didn't consider a Godzilla film and Toho agreed ret-conning it as a non-Godzilla movie (with affectionate nicknames such as G.I.N.O. and the official Zilla), this new entry still falls short of what I would call a good Godzilla movie.

Can this new reboot be considered a Godzilla film?

Yes

Clearly, the writers and director at least understand what Godzilla is, even if they tried to mash different versions of him into one, if not entirely successfully.

Is this film good?

No

Three major detractors for me:

1. Understand that Godzilla films have been around for going on 60 years. This is the 29th Godzilla film (Not counting the above mentioned ret-conned one) Fans of Godzilla know his Modus Operandi  and what he looks like despite the film specific details. For Gareth Edwards, whether through budget restrictions or artistic choice, to show Godzilla for just over seven minutes of screen time in a two hour movie is, in my opinion, the greatest fault of this film.

2. The pacing is the second fault, for me. This movie is long and following around a human soldier that I care very little about for nearly two hours, was just too much. This movie would have benefited from cutting about 20-30 minutes off from it's total run time. While I always have felt the human drama of a Godzilla movie is important and can add to the story, it should still, ultimately, only frame and add to the Godzilla side of the story. This film did the opposite despite it's format and presentation. A better title would have been: Brody: DaiKaiju Hunter.

3. The overall feel and theme of the film felt derivative. While this statement could be considered a sarcastically ironic one, being the 29th Godzilla film and all, stay with me. This Godzilla film borrowed themes of another Japanese Kaiju series, Gamera (I am speaking of the fantastic 1998 Gamera trilogy, specifically) and as such, just felt like a bit of a copy cat to me.

Ultimately these three particulars ruined it for me and I have no intention of buying it. It also moved it down to the bottom of my Godzilla list and sits as the worst Godzilla film of the franchise. Yes, even worse than the commonly called Godzilla's Revenge (Understanding the audience this film was made for, gives it a pretty big break).

A few nit-picks:

Bryan Cranston - While intended (I assume) to drive home the point that anyone in this film could die at any moment (ala Sam Jackson in Deep Blue Sea), it didn't work for me and seemed like a waste of an actor's potential performance.

Food - MUTO's fed off radiation, yet seemed to ignore sources of food fairly often.

Cutting away from Godzilla action, not once but twice! For shame!

Actually living in Las Vegas and seeing the MUTO break free from Area 51, head South, just to smash my city and then back North to San Francisco makes it seem like she lost a lot of money here on a previous trip. Okay, maybe this isn't such a bad reason.

Seven minutes of Godzilla, fourteen minutes of all monsters combined in a two hour film!?! Are you kidding me? I came to see Godzilla not Quicksilver being yucky with Scarlet Witch! ;p

Godzilla's animation - His design was good, if a bit fat, but his animators (or whomever made the decision) chose to accentuate that heavy, lumbering quality. Instead of looking like a Sumo Wrestler on top of his game, big but deft, moving like a fighter. Godzilla looked sloppy fat like an overweight Texan in a bar brawl over onion rings. Perhaps fitting, since this was an American production.

And many more....

The truth is ANY film could be nitpicked to death, but when a film is enjoyable, those minor issues seem to fade away into the backdrop. But when a film is disappointing, those minor issues become amplified. Sadly, for me, those minor issues became amplified.

A sequel has been announced, but sits in script outline phase and Toho has subsequently announced it's own production, it's likely we'll see the Toho film before the next American one. A similar thing happened over the 1998 version as well.",1424476800,3,4086,4.670850767085077

The story's pacing did a well job of keeping you in the action and in suspense to see if Godzilla would be able to take out the bad monsters. When it came to it the final battle was pretty cool.

The film does a great job doing a slow reveal of Godzilla but once everything is revealed it makes for a very fun action movie.

As for extras there are several features ranging from about 5 min to 20 or so minutes. Some are kind of add on's to the movie and others are behind the scenes and making of material. Definitely enough there for those who like to go through that material. The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray as you would expect.

5951421,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Very disappointed in this especially with the hype and description. First of all, ""an all star cast?"" not;/ minor actors from previous type second rate movies (except for Binoche).  Started well, first 45 minutes or so were well done, had some suspense and then story, but the second half was bad. It seems like the producers tried to weave together a story just to create more of the typical Hollywood special effects, and hope that would sell. But it doesn't work - its like two divergent plots sewn welded together with a large faulty weld seem that  falls apart.
The typical Godzilla v. these new monsters was the biggest let-down. Very poorly filmed mostly in darkness (on purpose),couldn't see what was going on except for aperiodic halitosis fire breath from the lizard, who by the way was our hero and defender against the real monsters.  BORING!
Obviously it was filmed in darkness to save production costs - one couldn't see anything so the makers didn't have to spend huge on full blown graphics and cinematography for our viewing pleasure.
Very mixed up and poor plot and story line. Again, like two or three divergent stories incapably woven into one even poorer effort.",1423526400,3,1183,4.846534653465347

Note that I have an 70"" OLED TV that normally looks perfect no matter what. The director / editor simply decided to not show off their very poor CG.

Subject is also tedious. It takes 1/2 the movie moving very slowly to even begin to set up the ""action"" part. Don't bother with it.",1422316800,4,409,4.298701298701299

5951508,4,B00EXPOCXY,Better than expected. An American company finally gets some things right in a Godzilla movie. The DVD itself is fine and the picture and sound great.

5951510,3,B00EXPOCXY,"For a movie titled Godzilla, we see 8 minutes of screen time of the fella. That's right, EIGHT minutes. He does not appear until the 1 hour mark!! And even then, only for a blip in HNL. And it's always dark, either in the evening or really bad weather so it's hard to see him.  Where's all the epic scenes of the kaiju battle?

The plot is a convoluted mess that leaves you wondering why they killed off Joe Brody, who had a powerful start with him and his wife in the opening scenes. Instead the main character is Brody's military son, who knows nothing about his father's research b/c he thought his father was a loon. So again, why did they kill off Joe Brody?

What a missed opportunity.  At least Godzilla looked good, like Gojira, and thankfully not like the 1998 Godzilla disaster where he looked like a t-rex dinosaur out of Jurassic Park. This movie can really learn from the 2008 The Incredible Hulk. How much screen time Hulk gets is how often we should be seeing Godzilla.

Hopefully we see much more Godzilla in the sequel.  2 stars for bad story and virtually no screen time for the lizard guy. Bumped up to 3 b/c he does look really cool, when they do actually show him.",1422230400,4,1185,4.363636363636363

I expect some ambiguity before the big reveal, and the trailers handled this perfectly. However, once the monsters have been discovered by the heroes, we should be allowed to admire them. It felt as if the director was ashamed of Godzilla and the MUTOs, using even less lighting than the seediest  of seedy nightclubs. Even the climax was filmed in the dark.

Edwards has done a magnificent job here. When I think of Godzilla, I don't think for one second of that abomination of 1998 with Broderick. That had nothing to do with Godzilla and was just cheap trash. This, however, is a work of art in modern monster cinema. It may sound corny, but you actually feel for Godzilla during the final battle. It's just so well done on so many levels compared to monster films and action movies.

I like the fact that the Scientists in this movie respect nature and the existence and purpose of Godzilla.  They us tell that the Mutas can not only feed on our so called power but easily protect themselves against us.  In many ways I find the movie very Green, we've been warned about Electromagnetic Pulses (EMPs), we've been warned that we need to curb our use of nuclear power, and we've been warned that we don't know all the answers and should be careful. We don't know what will come of the human need for control, power, and profit; this movie drives home a point.

The Broderick ""Godzilla"" is not even recognized as being the real Godzilla--it is now knows as ""Zilla."" The Godzilla in the 2014 version is loud, lumbering, unafraid, has atomic breath and is unfazed by man-made weapons. The Broderick  ZIlla was cowardly, skittish, did not have atomic breath and was ultimately ensared in a man made structure  and killed by man made weapons. To sum up, this 2014 version of Godzilla is vastly superior to the Broderick version. Anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know Godzilla....",1421971200,,806,5.052631578947368

It's always been fights with other monsters, people running and screaming, along with the military trying to destroy the creature.  What I did like, was the creature staying true to it's original beginning.  I did not like the look of the creature, starring Matthew Broderick.  Bryan Cranston was excellent in this film.  His character was energetic, and believable.  This made the movie more interesting in the first half.  The son, all grown up, was boring for me.  His acting was stiff, and not convincing.

There were some good special effects, but the movie could be a little dark at times.  The darkness made it a little hard to view the creatures at times.  Overall, it was an okay film.  I will probably add it to my collection being a fan of the earlier films.",1421884800,2,846,4.680272108843537

Once he arrives the movie gives me more of what I want . Its Godzilla . As a person that likes just enough story to feed me some action this falls a SHORT on action and the long on boring set up. If they would of let Godzilla take the lead role right at the beginning of the movie fans would be happier. I think it was a sincere effort to update Godzilla . I appreciate that . But the story was way too long and Godzilla was absent in virtually the entire  1st half of the movie . That is disappointing when the movie is called Godzilla. Its ok and you like to see the updated look of the franchise. It needed a lot more Godzilla to be anything I would truly enjoy . Next time I sure hope they make Godzilla a much BIGGER part on Screen .
This movie could of been cut down to 70 minutes and Been more enjoyable.
Godzilla does have a bit of a different look to him in this . A little on the chubby side. That really wasn't to big of a deal to me . Some did not like the new look . I didn't have a problem with it as I didn't want to see a guy in a Godzilla suit in this modern time . lol The much bigger problem is Godzilla is barely in this long movie .

Lastly, the movie has a lot of the MONSTER scenes  shot at night in the dark. It was another BAD Idea. The reality is we want to see the creatures. To frustrate the viewer with darkness in a lot of the movie is pathetic . I wasn't scared at all . If that what they hope for it failed . I was annoyed with the decision to not show us what we want to see.

Overall , I wanted to like it but a bad boring script, limited monster scenes shot mainly in darkness and the simple failure to delivery on what people want to see . It is a 2 star movie unless you like bad stories with plenty of boredom .",1421712000,2,2111,3.9

5951577,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Not sure if this is the case for others, but the movie is so dark you practically can't seen the scenes with Godzilla. I was thinking maybe it was my TV but then I watched the ""making of"" scenes on the other DVD and you could clearly see that they would have a great looking Godzilla and then they would add more shading and computer effects and Godzilla would become too dark. Apparently they wanted it like that. Ugh. They show close-ups of Godzilla's facial expressions (very cool) that get totally lost in the night scenes. Did they shoot so many night scenes because they thought it would cover up any flaws? The scene at the bridge was great. Godzilla was fantastic in those, so that can't be the reason.
I have not watched it yet in the digital version for my computer. Maybe that will make a difference.
Watching the movie again was painful because I forgot how boring the movie was between the actions scenes. I'm a Godzilla fan but this movie was not much better than the last awful American remake (the acting is better but not significantly after Cranston leaves the film). I keep hearing they are making another one so I'm begging you now: keep the action in the daylight.
Finally: the extra DVD isn't worth much. But at $10 bucks rather than $20, I'm glad I waited for a cheaper price.",1421625600,2,1299,4.485232067510548

On the positive side, the film has class. Cranston does well for the short time he's in it. It's not like some stupid Transformers flick. I think they captured the feel of the old Godzilla films. The negative? I don't know why but Godzilla is rarely seen in the film. He screams a few times, we see his massive legs, and one time, just as he's about to kick ass, the film irises-in. Very disappointing. After seeing Pacific Rim, a guilty pleasure, I would've thought filmmakers would follow their lead and create some stunning fight sequences, but they didn't. Instead, I watched humanity track the evil MUTO's for eighty minutes and philosophize about their presence and Godzilla's role in the affair. Finally, for the final five minutes, there's a titanic Godzilla-MUTO throwdown I'd been waiting for. Five minutes. That's it. So a huge chase-the-monster scene and people tripping over themselves to get out of or into Godzilla's way, and that's it. Godzilla wins. Blasts his nuclear breath once.

5951608,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Not having been able to go out to the theater too much last year, this was one of many films that I missed then but am catching up on now. While it wouldn't have made my top 10 for the year, this was definitely one of the best monster/disaster movies I've seen in recent memory. The story follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson), a Navy bomb disposal expert, who travels to Japan to get his father out of some trouble. His father used to work for a Japanese company, but after a cataclysmic event 15 years ago the area has been quarantined off, yet he still thinks that there's something going on besides the official story that it was a natural disaster. The ""thing"" actually turns out to be a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that they've been keeping contained. However when it escapes all hell breaks loose, and chaos and massive destruction ensue. Of course, you might be wondering where Godzilla fits into all of this. Despite the title of the movie, Godzilla only appears onscreen for about 10-15 minutes. Still, the those precious minutes are worth it as he takes on the MUTO. One thing I appreciated about the film was that it didn't overexpose the monsters, instead letting the human drama take center stage. You get to spend time with the characters you'd most identify with, and the effects of a disaster were dealt with in a very realistic, down-to-earth way, even amongst all of the chaos and destruction. In fact, there was quite a large human cast such that I'd almost wish they'd delved a little deeper so that more time could be spent building things up. The worst offender is probably the prologue which set everything up. It was very effective in establishing a baseline, but not so much in terms of character building. Of course, all complaints aside, all of the performances were excellent. I just wish there had been more Bryan Cranston. In terms of visual effects and spectacle, this film stands head and shoulders above everything that came out in 2014. Scenes of destruction and mayhem were handled very well, and the creatures were also very well-animated. I should also mention the outstanding score by Alexandre Desplat, which hit all the right beats and fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Overall, I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't see this on the big screen but it was still an exciting viewing experience. It pays attention to its human characters and while the monsters don't take up too much screen time, when the action comes it delivers big time. Highly recommended.",1421366400,,2527,4.758542141230068

I even liked what they did to Godzilla's origin.  Instead of being a mutation due to Hydrogen Bomb tests, they made him an ancient alpha predator, nature's power to restore balance.  Not only did this sum up Godzilla's actual character from 1954 to present, they made him more like a God, reinforcing his status as the King of the Monsters.  Bringing in a totally different monster was also a clever move.  I like Mothra and King Ghidorah as much as the next Godzilla fan but sometimes a new face or two can prove to have a better outcome.  I noticed that many complain about the lack of focus on the fight scene, but I liked how they weaved the human conflict around the monster fight.  It made the movie interesting, it had me wondering what was going to happen and if anybody was going to get crushed because they were working between Godzilla and the M.U.T.O.  The ending had me worried at first because to me, Godzilla cannot die.  That's why the word ""God"" is in his name.

They did OK with that.  What they got wrong doesn't get in the way much.  That it makes no sense is a little annoying.  How can there be balance if there's nothing left on one side?  Anyway.  Godzilla looks more like his old self than he did last time around.  His personality has returned only somewhat.  He gets mad and makes good use of his tail but there's none of that almost Curly Howard energy the original has.  He's always entertaining, and occasionally exciting, but never funny.

Too much screen time devoted to Godzilla's nemesis's, and not the lead monster.  Dry and dull acting for the most part.

Bring back Ghidorah, Rodan, etc. or any of the other original rivals to Godzilla, would've been a nice treat to fans.

5951705,3,B00EXPOCXY,"i rented this Godzilla remake/version from The Box and was impressed by the CGI effects that were Spielberg Jurassic Park like in quality that included chest movement to reproduce breathing motions and throat vibrations as the monsters were vocal. It seemed to me like this rendition was more about the monsters and less about the people who were trying to stop them. By that I mean there was much less character development for the humans Vs. the monsters and even less about Godzillia and where he was hiding out all this time? I still enjoyed this movie, but I liked the 98 movie better with Broderick and Reno as their characters were much better developed as was most of the other supporting cast. It just had more character like ability than this movie does and a movie just isn't as good/fun to watch without likable characters for me. Some have mentioned that this movie is more like the early Godzilla and they might be right and that may be why I didn't enjoy this one as much. 5 stars for effects, but 3 stars for overall story presentation. Lots of death and destruction, but not in a graphic and gory way and the cursing is kept to a minimum. There wasn't any sex or nude scenes in the movie.

5951818,1,B00EXPOCXY,"This Godzilla movie was a complete disappointment and waste of money.  The director and writer should have been fired (and the producers for allowing it to be released). (I say this to emphasize how badly disappointed I am in this movie.) Some will say you don't get real Japanese Godzilla movies if you don't like this one, but that is bull.  I've seen every Godzilla movie there is, as well as Mothra and others, and this is nothing like them.  For one, a movie about Godzilla is actually supposed to SHOW Godzilla, not spend 2 hours mostly in dark lighting settings where you often can't even see what is going on with the human characters, and only with snatches of images of the monsters.  Two, while it's ok to use the dark to increase suspense and scare you a couple of times, doing it constantly is just boring with no climax.  Three, the fight between Godzilla and the two muto monsters isn't even shown, except in glimpses as the human characters run into dark holes or hide in underground areas.

This was more a weird focus on the aftermath of the monsters progress, from scenes of the hospital, to people worrying over where their loved ones are, to random kids looking scared, to dark bits you can't see which might have been scary if not for that, to melodramatic fluff of the so-called main character who is always the 'sole survivor'. Even the science was wrong!  In a Godzilla flick, the science is usually either totally 'magic' science gimmicky (and humorous because you know it's totally unrealistic) or smack on target. This was neither and the writer just really didn't do his homework!  And Godzilla movies typically have a lot of humor, not weirdly heavenly music (for an eternally long halo jump) or other oddities.  This one had zilch humor and was just painful.  The 3D was ok and frankly deserved better than being hidden in the dark all the time.

If you want a good Godzilla flick, check out the original, or the Japanese Godzilla 2000, or the American Godzilla with Matthew Broderick (though with the last be prepared for it to be more an alternate universe Godzilla, where it's the French...yes, the FRENCH!!... who did the nuclear tests and a giant dinosaur (no superpowers) rather than the superpowered familiar Godzilla we know and love...but frankly, it was done really well and was a ton of fun to watch, a real hoot if you just enjoy the humor/action....definitely not well marketed because it deserved better...and certainly any of those three are better than this disaster. Though again, be warned, the Broderick Godzilla movie, it's not really a Godzilla movie, but more a 'radioactive dinosaur rampage in NYC' movie.)",1420156800,14,2660,4.773420479302832

5951959,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I was first in line to see this opening night. I didn't even bother buying popcorn. It was me with my friends. It was me and my favorite monster. What's more important, it was me seeing Godzilla on the big screen for the very first time. So to me, the moment was huge.

I walked out of that theater, nothing short of happy.

So nowadays you can imagine why I wonder why do many day this movie was terrible. I just don't understand it. They may say things like ""Eh, it's better than the 1998 version"" (which we'll talk about later), ""Godzilla wasn't in it enough"", ""They always cut away from the action!"", and honestly, I'm just thinking to myself, what's the big deal?

First of all, before I go on, beverage I got a feeling this will be a long review, yes. Their points can be justified. Godzilla isn't down through a majority of the film, and even I was wondering when they'd show us a little more action, but it's still a fun film to follow.

I must address point number one. Godzilla isn't seen a lot. Yeah. I kinda expected that, because this film is a REBOOT. That means we are getting reacquainted with Godzilla. This means, though we know who he is, you should walk into that theater wondering about the mystery that is Godzilla. I thought they played off his origins wonderfully. It's different to an extent, but still wonderfully told. Another thing to say, is that Godzilla doesn't always hold the screen in Japan either. He had little screen time in his debut as well, and there are other movies where he may be in the screen more, but a lot of time he's standing there just getting attacked by a monster before he does anything. We'll talk more about the action shortly though. For what this movie is, the buildup was fantastic. When Godzilla was on that screen, I almost felt the nature of fear in my body again. Heck, the five minutes of when he is finally seen and approaching the shore, is undoubtedly the best Godzilla introduction I've ever seen, or will ever see likely, where he approaches the shore, the waters recede and become a devastating tsunami, the city lights go out, and flats light up a mass that isn't even fully pictured. Follow that to an airport, where the antagonist monster is causing havoc, and people scream in terror amidst a series of explosions, before Godzilla's foot comes crashing down, silencing everyone. The antagonist monster, or MUTO, roars out in vain to try and threaten it, before we get a camera pan from the feet to the head of Godzilla amongst an ambient choir. There he is in all his glory... and he shows us how a real roar is made. Oh. My. God....Zilla.

The action is there, even if it comes and goes. I won't deny, there were times I really wanted to see Godzilla fighting the MUTO monsters more than see what the army was up to. But I also hold to the belief that too much action can be bad (and if you don't believe me, go watch an average Michael Bay film). Don't get me wrong, there are times it is kinda angering. They cut away from the fight TWICE. Once was fine. I thought it a bold move. Twice is a little much. The film's third act is played out spectacularly. In fact, I found myself cheering in the theater. Starting that third act out with that Skydiving scene, building up to the true potential power Godzilla has, and seeing Godzilla really bringing in the fight to these monsters was nothing short of fascinating. In fact, the third act made me fidget about any frustration I had over the first two thirds of the film. The payoff at the end is just way too much! Unbelievable!

Another thing I really like her that other Godzilla movies don't really do nowadays... is put effort into the story. I can remember the plot of this story. I can't often do that with other Godzilla films, because the story is just not thought out enough. You may be able to list elements out. ""Oh there's time travel in Godzilla VS King Ghidorah"", but the story, and I might add, the way they did Time Travel was just not done right. Here you were given a believable, even if pretty clichd story. And while the acting wasn't spot on,  name ONE Godzilla movie that has perfect acting. You can't, because there isn't one. It's all a little over the top of you ask me. Put this story to a great score that this movie gives us, and you got a happy movie watcher here who is willing to overlook clich.

You can tell I love this film. It's not at all perfect, nor did I expect it to be. But the point is that it's not so bad that people make it to be. I hear people calling it a ""s*** stain"" and I'm just thinking, ""Oh go cry in your personal utopia that never existed"". What needs to be taken out here is that there is no perfect way to do a Godzilla movie. But I believe Gareth did the monster extreme justice, especially when you think of 1998. The fact that Toho thinks this film to be fantastic kinda reassured me, and I had someone telling me that that didn't matter because they just want money and whatnot, and honestly, I really doubt that. They had the guts to say they hated 1998. I think they'd be honest with themselves here.

For what this movie is, it's a winner in my book. And now that we got two more movies on the way from Gareth, AND the rights to Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah, I believe the fans have all the more reason to be excited. The King of Monsters is back, and he's not going away anytime soon.

5951977,4,B00EXPOCXY,"After reading all the negative reviews I almost didn't get this film. I guess some people are so jaded and used to instant gratification that they cannot watch a storyline along with a film about a monster.

First of all you see plenty of monsters here causing massive destruction. If watching a nuclear reactor collapse followed by the destruction of Tokyo, San Francisco and Las Vegas with brilliant special effects is not exciting enough for you, then you're just impossible to entertain. I don't know when the action really stopped. After the initial character development (which is in all films), this film goes non-stop until the end with end-of-the-world type of action. Sure it's filmed in the dark. The effects are more real that way, and it's more scary when you catch glimpses of something unimaginably horrible, instead of seeing too much monster - which will look unrealistic if it is on the screen too long.

Don't be fooled by the bad reviews here. I assume they're from the short attention span generation. If you're looking for a good monster flick this is for you!",1419638400,,1082,4.8432432432432435

5951980,4,B00EXPOCXY,"BOTTOM LINE: A fun diversion that comes closer to the mark than the previous try back in 1998. Still not on par with the Japanese films in terms of excitement or sheer lunacy but this entry by director Gareth Edwards does show a glimmer of promise for interesting things to come. Worth a look and recommended for sure for fans of the radioactive reptile.

THE STORY: A second American-made reboot attempt of the iconic atomic superlizard. Here, the Big Guy finds himself pitted against some ancient prehistoric foes that could threaten the planet and become the dominant species on Earth if left unchecked. Think the G-Man's gonna take that challenge lying down? Think again!

THOUGHTS: (contains spoilers): The King is back, getting a more respectful treatment this time around than he received back in 1998 at the hands of Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich in that putrid 're-imagining' starring Matthew Broderick. Ugh. This 2014 take on the Big G is not without its problems, to be sure. The lead actor is, I'm sorry to say, pretty bland & boring. If only they had chosen to focus the narrative on Bryan Cranston. *SIGH* Now THAT would've made for a much more intense film and an infinitely finer and more focused lead performance. Good actors like Julliette Binoche and Elizabeth Olsen are sadly relegated to small bit parts. Too bad.  The focus, again, SHOULD have been on the relationship between Cranston's Joe Brody and Ken Watanabe's Ichiro Serizawa. That would have made for a much more interesting film and it would've really been a delight to see those two fine actors play off one another. Oh well. It is what is it, I suppose.

According to the bonus material, (pitifully thin as it is, unfortunately), director Gareth Edwards says he ""loved"" that he kept teasing his audience by cutting away when you least expected it, keeping us baited throughout the film with only snippets of the title monster. Sorry, pal, but I cannot disagree with you more. Godzilla should have gotten far more screen time than what he ended up with. I realize that every second he's on film cost tons due to the fact that he's entirely computer-generated, but he is the STAR. Yet it felt more like he was just a guest-star in his own film!  Argh! Very frustrating! The end confrontation between Godzilla and the female MUTO is also anti-climatic. It lasts literally less than 30 seconds. The monster fights could (and should) have been SO much better.

Even so, this film is pretty fun and the fights are exciting, albeit on the brief side. Speaking of brevity, the film's running time could've stood a 20 minute or so trim without losing any narrative focus. But at least the film makers here made an honest effort to build an interesting world for this new Godzilla to exist in. I liked his new origin/back story, and the two MUTO creatures were weird and interesting, separately and together. The musical score was good and kept the tension going in the right spots. The cinematography looked great, but it was a bummer that they chose to have most of the creature conflict at the end take place at night. This is usually done to hide poor quality CGI, but the final shot of Godzilla entering San Francisco Bay in broad daylight showed that they could make him look 100% photo-realistic and interact within the cityscape believably. Hopefully next time we'll see a city-based final monster battle sequence during the daytime.

THE BLU-RAY: GODZILLA 2014 looks pretty nice. Clean, clear & sharp. The picture leans toward the dark side of things, but that's due to the way it was shot and that fact that a lot of the film takes place at night. The bonus content was rather on the paltry side, but the Top Secret MONARCH-based ""training films"" they devised were very imaginative and a heckuva lot of fun. More like those, please! The movie's soundmix was clear, solid and well-balanced. Thankfully, I didn't find myself constantly turning the volume up during dialogue scenes and way down during the action sequences, like I do with some films where the sound balance is all over the place. Overall, I give this new film a full 4 STARS. With this new American version of Godzilla I found myself coming out the theater feeling happy instead of embarrassed and eagerly anticipating the sequel.

5951982,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I have never seen a movie of which I wanted all the human characters to die. But with this one I did, because they kept interrupting what is the best about this movie: Godzilla and his hunt for the monster called Muto.

What's more, the human characters adds nothing to this movie. None were likable. None had any significance to the outcome of the movie. They were there just to take up time. And that they did well, and that was annoying. It is too bad Godzilla didn't stomp on all the human characters in the first 10 minutes of this movie. That would have made the movie more enjoyable to watch.

But to no avail. We are instead left with a movie where Godzilla gets to fight Muta for about 5 whole minutes.

Pros:
1)Spectacular fight sequences of Godzilla and his foe.
2)Best on-screen Godzilla ever.

Cons
1)Most of the movie is about humans and their inconsequential dialogues and behavior that exists just to take up screen-time. You can safely text your friends when the human characters are on-screen and you will miss nothing important in this movie.
2)Godzilla is the smartest character in the movie. Somehow, all the humans in this movie have a IQ lower than a reptile.",1419638400,,1182,4.587677725118484

5952027,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I think the key to liking this movie is to have no expectations of it.  The original Godzilla, starring Raymond Burr, was one of the first monster movies I watched as a kid. I 'dug it'!  And, unlike some, I also really liked the remake starring Matthew Broderick, et al.  I kinda expected more of the same with this flick.  Wrong!  First, it is a very different story line. Second, Godzilla is not the sole focus of the movie. And, third, the Godzilla monster reminds one of those in the flood of cheesy follow-;up Japanese movies that succeeded the original., movies in which Godzilla was the 'good guy'.  However, the acting in this one is first rate and the special effects are excellent.  It gets a little slow (and 'soppy' with human drama) at times, but redeems itself by the end.  In the final analysis, it is a movie that I will watch and enjoy again and again, so I feel confident in recommending it to those who like movies in this genre.  I would say, however, that the title of the film should be changed to ""Godzilla vs. M.U.T.O."" and should be watched with 'tongue in cheek'.",1419292800,,1089,4.459595959595959

There's a scene in which our Point of View is the inside of some kind of building, with large doors open to an unfolding Monster vs. Monster action scene. The director promptly CLOSES THE DOORS as the action begins! This inspired my niece to issue an MST3K-type comment to the screen ... ""Movie? MOVIE?! Wait! That's what we WANT TO SEE.""

Because believe me, you want to SEE the actual monsters (assuming there actually are any, which I'm not totally convinced of) because the PLOT is more of a PLOD than anything else.

Thanks to almost no development, I honestly didn't care anything whatsoever for any of the characters except the one on the marquise.  In other words, no real character depth whatsoever.  It was really like, ""here, this is this person, and that's that one, and now this one's dead, and so is that one, and these characters MIGHT die.....oh LOOK....a monster...and it is spectacular!"".  And, fact is, the big guy has a few close ups, but he is WAY late in the movie.  All of this cost two (almost three!) stars.  The special effects, however, save an otherwise bland movie.  They were engrossing and the re-imagining of Godzilla's appearance works on an epic scale.

5952058,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I am really of two minds about this movie. On one hand, it has good special effects, and provides a decent backstory for the reinvention of Godzilla. On the other hand, there are some choices made that are really disappointing. Some of these include: a wonderful cast, who really aren't allowed to develop after the first quarter of the movie (following that they just run around and shout things); having Godzilla and his opponents fight in almost complete darkness so little can be seen of their struggle; the ludicrous size of the Godzilla depicted in this film which is probably physically impossible, and definitely stretches any suspension of disbelief to the breaking point and beyond; and to a lesser extent the lack of a clear moral that the historical Godzilla films always had.

There is a lot to like about the monster design, Godzilla looks good, and sounds great. His opponents are entirely new creations that have a decently realized backstory, and are well realized.

So, it appears that this film will be the first of a triology. Maybe subsequent films will improve on some of these issues?",1419120000,,1107,4.882978723404255

The one actor that remains is whisked around to various locations without any explanation of how you jump across the Pacific to the US, except that we need this character for a irrelevant subplot that insults the intelligence of the audience.

The actions of the military in the movie are ridiculous. Planes and helicopters don't need to fly three inches from a monster to shoot it. Where do you hide a monster that feeds on radiation? Why in a mine full of radioactive contamination, of course!

First I get rid of the negatives.  1.  Not enough monster fights.  While we do actually get to see the Mutos destroy stuff and Godzilla shows up in the middle of the film, we didn't actually get to see the fighting until the climactic battle between them near the end.  2.  Not enough Bryan Cranston.  If you're gonna put the guy from Breaking Bad in here, then don't have him get killed off in the first thirty or so minutes of the film.  Have him be one of the major characters instead.  3.  Honestly what the hell else could the army do to fight creatures like the Mutos.

5952172,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla never looked so good.
The special effects were breathtaking, the action fast-paced and the devastation and military countermeasures believable and inspiring.
So, why 3 stars?
Er, umm, they didn't call this the unknown monster from the gloom, or the thing that came from another place.  They called this 'Godzilla' and they stepped on some famous old toes.
Godzilla was a special thing, very much like our Wizard of Oz.  As you know, the Wizard of Oz was not just a movie but an entire world of books, illustrations and stories.  Godzilla became an industry in Japan and elsewhere, with the inevitable Godzilla vs. (fill in the blank) from Mothra to King Kong.  The early Godzilla was far less threatening looking and not nearly as sinister and ugly as the Godzilla-imposter in this film.
Most of all, I sincerely doubt any child will be sentimental and say, ""Goodbye Godzilla"" to this spectre, this monster of pure evil such as starred in this film.  So please, call it something else, but not 'Godzilla'.  And please, no Godzilla-Junior's for this Godzilla-imposter either.  Thanks...",1418428800,2,1094,5.011049723756906

I didn't have any complaints and I feel they can improve on fighting and expanded story lines in future movies.

Finally what I thought was Godzilla appears. I did not find out into much later into the film that this was not Godzilla at all. The movie is often dark and hard to see what is going on. I also had no idea what was going on in the movie full stop. The dialog is appalling, this is the movies biggest let down, from one scene to another with no flow as to what the hell is going on. I realised at the end that there is 2 other monsters  that Godzilla is trying to destroy even though the army is trying to destroy him as well.
Poor plot, poor acting , no direction. Sound in 5.1 is great as is some of the effects (2 stars for this)

The only real drawbacks to this movie are the emotional undertones and the lead character whose features convey about the same degree of emotion as Steven Seagal's have over time. He's not a terrible actor but he is outclassed and average when measured against the likes of Watanabe and Cranston. What this director has understood is that much like the Incredible Hulk, it's wiser to have Godzilla in measured doses. Go watch Emmerich's take on Godzilla and see if the 'disaster' nature of it doesn't end up seeming almost comical and tiresome after a while.

5952344,3,B00EXPOCXY,Rather boring actually...I like the original movies better.  They were just more fun.  I think the special effects just ruined the fun aspect of the godzilla movie.  Worth a watch if nothing else is on but not a must see movie.,1417737600,2,227,4.487804878048781

5952347,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla fans will never truly be satisfied with any remakes.. that's perfectly clear. I'm sure the production crew knew that going into the movie but tried to make it as good as possible. For my money, they succeeded, and made the best one yet. A few things were amiss, but acting wasn't bad at all. And of course the message about atomic weapons (are bad, mmkay) was poignant and enlightening.. something Godzilla's always been able to do under the surface. You win this round, Hollywood.",1417651200,,490,4.776470588235294

5952351,5,B00EXPOCXY,The scenario if how Godzilla came to be was really interesting and somewhat scary.

5952352,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I'm not too sure what was going on in this thing.

5952370,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Good story of how the monsters came to be. Great effects and acting.

5952371,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Campy, sure it has everything for the Godzilla fan, but it sorely delivered. Even the few characters the movie follows it still doesn't connect you or make you feel compelled to stick with the film because it is all about destruction on a CGI level...an excuse with modern advancement to demolish cities with huge, 19th century creations.

5952417,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Special EFX were good. The scale of the monsters was captured really well.

The plot was very much like early Godzilla movies. If you haven't been a fan of the last few remakes because of their departure from the earlier franchise, then this should bring some level of nostalgia to your viewing.

Keeping the lead actors involved and present in the main storyline of the movie felt forced at times. Be ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit.

The whole idea of these movies is to see giant monsters beat each other up. Did Godzilla kill those things at the end? I guess so. Horrible production choices.

The parts that took place during the day or at least had a little lighting were good so I give them props for that.

If you want giant monsters- watch Pacific Rim. At least you can watch that without eye strain.

Yes you see more of the other monster than Godzilla

Yes it's a bit slow

But it still delivers a interesting story and once you see Godzilla it does hype you up a bit.

5952503,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I guess this was a movie you had to see in the theater, and when I say ""see"", I mean literally visualize. I wanted, so bad, to enjoy this movie... My wife and I watched this on Friday night ""Movie Night"". We watched the Blu-ray edition on our PS4. We got sucked right into the story by a heart wrenching performance by Bryan Cranston. After an hour my wife got up and went to bed- frustrated and confused from not being able to see what was going on. I stuck with it, hoping for a big third act pay-off.
Seriously, The soundtrack music was dazzling, the sound effects were raising the roof, the screen was... black. Literally. Nearly every night scene (and there are many)- too dark to see. The live action and daylight scenes were clear enough but the Special effects (Monster scenes) take place mainly at night and you cannot make heads or tails of whats going on. FRUSTRATING!!!
Godzilla (1954), Godzilla (1998), Jurassic Park (T-Rex scene), and Cloverfield, just to name a few, were shot at night as well, but all of these films gave the viewer a clear and distinct visual of characters both human and not. You could follow the visual story line.

I've enjoyed watching Godzilla movies since I was a kid, so, I know the lay of the land. There's a lot of things I can forgive while watching this Godzilla movie, after all, it's a Godzilla movie; CGI effects that make the monster look like a man in a costume. Godzilla with tiny Geisha feet. 2 Cheesy looking nemesis (who actually share a tender kiss), but what Blu-ray studio chief looked at this Blu-ray's black screen for at least half of the movie, and said ""Perfect, Ship it.""? SERIOUSLY, YOU HAVE TO ABLE TO SEE THE STAR OF THE SHOW!!! Even the climactic pay-off battle between the two bugs and Godzilla was so dark I had no Idea who was winning or losing.
I read where some critics were defending this BD claiming it was an artistic choice by the Director to make it dark. Even trusted critics at Blu-Ray.com and HI-Def Digest rated the video quality very high. Well, I've seen dark films before... SEVEN immediately comes to mind. JENNIFER 8, THE DESCENT, SILENT HILL, MIMIC, QUARANTINE. These are films that are artistically dark. Godzilla (2014) is a badly made Blu-ray. Yes, I'm going against the tide. I'm going against the vast number of Blu-ray critics who seem to be saying ""Who ya gonna trust- me, or your own eye's?  ""THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES ON!!, GOT IT?!! I don't want or need a ""Critic"" to tell me otherwise.

On the plus side; I applaud the writer who figured out a way to make Godzilla a friend of the planet, indirectly fighting on behalf of mankind and not just mindlessly stomping everything in it's path with his tiny Geisha feet. People have always cheered for Godzilla, but now they have a reason to. A Godzilla to cheer for WITHOUT reducing him to a big lovable teddy bear.

A lot of people rated this movie very high. I assume it's because they've seen it in a theater- and could actually SEE it. I must have fumbled with every button I have on my HDTV and HD Blu-ray player before finally coming to the conclusion; This Edition has to be a mistake. Forget the 3D glasses, you'll need Night-vision goggles.
This Blu-ray is badly in need of Raymond Burr from the 1954 Godzilla film, sitting in his radio booth, giving a blow by blow description of the final battle so the viewer will know whats going on. Maybe it was planned so that after enough people complain, they will release a ""new and improved brighter edition"" and force a double dip. I don't know....
Anyway... I cannot make a call about the film itself, but the Blu-ray sucks and my gut tells me that you shouldn't bother with the 3D Edition either unless you want to see what darkness looks like in 3D.
Sorry folks, I wanted to like this movie, but I have to call them as I ""see"" them.",1417219200,14,3832,4.48567335243553

5952508,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I didn't hate this version, although I know some will disagree... I grew up watching the old Godzilla movies, like subtitled in Japanese from the 60's. My mother was waaaay into the genre, so me and my brother basically laughed at her enthusiasm towards this clearly fake looking lizard leaving what could have only been a bathtub surrounded by toy ships. I will say even then I could see why someone would find Godzilla awesome. He or it was meant to be larger than life and a savior.  This movie really went into the back story of Godzilla, which I think needed to be done.  Godzilla was created as a result of the events or WWII.  It's really a movie steeped in some real and terrifying events in their history and made into, finally, and interestingly told story in the 2014 version.  They really did it justice.  Granted, the back story and explanation may have gone on for too long, or was too weighted in the beginning.  If you have the patience to sit through it, fortunately (or unfortunately depending on how you look at it) there is a major payoff at the last 1/2 hour to 45 mins of the movie.  There are some parts that totally baffle me and you will know what I mean when you see it.  SPOILER ALERT::: Many important main characters die.  The only thing that could explain the writers killing them off is that they may have had other commitments elsewhere and couldn't commit to the months it takes to shoot a film, but still.  I feel they were use for trailers to bring people in.  Kinda a cruel trick, but anyway.  That's my main gripe and why I'm only giving this movie 3 stars.",1417132800,2,1594,4.421232876712328

5952524,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Just having the name: Godzilla in a movie will attract attention. Filming it the way this one was, will lose it - almost instantly.

The problem is, the movie is all over the place - much like Godzilla's waistline. The thing that brought us to see it, the giant monsters and their battles, are too long in coming and nowhere to be seen - because they take place in near total darkness! WHAT were they thinking?

Oh, and this is the FATTEST Godzilla ever! He's fatter than BARNEY! It is amazing he can get from one end of the wide screen frame to the other without collapsing! Not to worry, he has so little screen time (poor thing is exhausted) that there's no danger of over exposure - just over weight. He's the star of the shown which means, whenever possible, don't show him on screen. I can't wait for the sequel when I won't see him again!

Not to worry, we have a  new baddy, a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) which, is impossible to see properly because it emerges to life in the dark - ooh, scary! Apparently, it is either Godzilla's main food source, or arch enemy or some thing that can kill Godzilla before he has a stroke, or - well, who knows what, because the sound of the dialog explaining what it is, is so murky it is impossible to understand. But I think humans caused it to come to life, or grew it from radiation or something.

I did not understand how Godzilla came to be there, but apparently, he was alive in the pre-pre-pre Cretaceous period when Earth was radioactive and dinosaurs were REALLY big and ate uranium - or something really fattening like that. Why Godzilla is still alive wasn't explained or I missed it when a sound effect drowned out what the actors were saying.

The human cast consists of a bunch of people who have been sort of aware of these monsters for a really long time, but have kept them hidden from the population - wait for it - by faking nuclear plant meltdowns. But now that the MUTO has escaped, they have to figure out how to deal with it. Oh - maybe Godzilla will take care of it!?

Yep, the hope is that Godzilla will kill or eat the MUTO, or something like that. But anyone in the audience can easily see that if Godzilla DID eat the MUTO, he'd get so fat that he'd explode. Which might have made this movie more entertaining.

The characters must have figured this out because they - get this - plan to set off a nuke. Nukes are the answer to everything in sci-fi movies. Except they usually backfire and that's just the problem in this movie.

The monsters eat radiation, so how can a nuke possibly help? The admiral of the US Navy carrier that is following Godzilla (who is out for a leisurely swim that will land him in San Francisco Bay) knows! Just set one off the right distance from the battling monsters so the force of the blast will mow them down - no kidding. Of course, the MUTO might eat Godzilla before they can do this (at which point IT would explode), or something else might (and does) go wrong. (I won't give away the exciting and predictable surprise.)

Confused and frustrated, almost as much as the audience by now, the entire military industrial complex of the United States follows the monsters around in navy ships and helicopters trying to decide on a course of action while Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco get obliterated - which we don't see as much as hear, because the monsters only destroy cities at night when it IS PITCH DARK!

This has to be the CLEVEREST way of filming a monster attack - by not showing it. BRILLIANT!

Well, it worked for radio when you let your imagination paint pictures in your mind.

But not to worry, there is something we CAN see. Yes, it is the handsome military guy who leaves his wife and young son to fight the monsters. We get to flash between his life and adventure, and theirs, while the world explodes around them.

Where HAVE we seen that before? Hmmm...

In fairness, they do show us our star, Godzilla in daylight a few times, and he is huge. But he is so bloated, he's nothing like what we are used to. When he opens his mouth to roar (not a good roar, by the way), there is the terror that he's actually going to hurl. And there is also the idea how he might defeat the MUTO.  He'll roll over it - SPLAT!

The MUTOs (oops, spoiler alert, there are more than one) are pretty cool looking - when we get to see them. They are as lean as Godzilla is - er - plump, so they've got plenty of energy for stomping on cities while looking for nuclear power plants to eat. Much of this takes place in the dark, or in the rain (why is it ALWAYS raining in giant monster movie remakes?), or a monster rushes by or is too large to fit in frame or.. well, after a while of this vagueness, I stopped trying to figure out anything about them.

The movie is not much fun primarily because it makes no sense. It takes too long to get to the monsters, and when it does, we can't see them clearly or for any length of time to visually process what they look like so we can feel ""oh, that's awesome!"".

We don't understand enough about the monsters. We know humanity sort of resurrected them or something and is paying for that blunder. This is Godzilla - humans must have done something stupid. Worst of all, because it should have been done WAY better, we get to see the forgettable hero run around and then finally rejoin his family - just as we have in many other movies before this one.

They were reinventing Godzilla by making him the fattest dinosaur ever to roam the earth, why not reinvent the tired clich of the hero?

The movie lost me towards the end because the big monster fights were impossible to see. So I wound up WAITING, hoping one of the characters would explain what the heck happened. No such luck.

Dad finds wife and son (oh joy - a happy reunion) and then we get a final and really stupid Godzilla surprise at the end. Yes - he joins Weight Watchers.

Not really. I won't give away the incredible surprise that will not have you jumping to your feet in enthusiastic applause. You'll have to suffer through the film first.

This could have been a good film if it had interesting characters, believable monsters, put Godzilla on a diet (or at least don't let him eat the entire cast of Jurassic Park before coming on set) and fight scenes were visible.

Maybe that's asking too much from a modern ""re-imagined"" movie?

Almost all of the action scenes took place at night, making it extremely difficult to discern what was happening. I remember thinking 'why don't they make some of these scenes take place during the day? '  This is a fictional movie, so they could have made the action take place anytime. And as for the night scenes involving the military, why did none of them have night vision goggles? We instead see them shining flashlights all around and only illuminating a very small area.

This is by far the best remake of Godzilla since I don't even acknowledge the Mathew Brodrick one as a Godzilla movie.  In this case, because the movie begins with the danger that we as humans created and the man(Brian Cranston) who is trying desperately to alert the world. While we have a few good actors, Elizabeth Olsen of the Olsen twins and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are not bad but the true star is the King himself even though Taylor-Johnson had the largest part in the film and carried it remarkably well considering who his co-stars are. This one is for the true old school Godzilla fan,  And like any good movie, the expectation of seeing the star is hinted at by old black and white film and Joe Brody(Cranston) retelling of the disaster that took the life of his wife and ended his career as a brilliant scientist and tore his family apart. The adversaries are seen first and hints of what to expect are tossed at you until his arrival. And it is a grand one at that. I read some reviews where people felt there was little screen time devoted to Godzilla but there  is enough of a grand build up to his full exposure that you really don't miss it because the anticipation is great. And it did not disappoint. The director did this movie justice by allowing us to remember the old versions where he comes in because we puny humans have created a problem and he is there to protect us from our folly. And this time, it's not Tokyo that receives the brunt of the destruction. All I can say is this is one movie that has earned a place of honor among my favorite monster movies, one that I will never tire of seeing. I do hope there will be another follow up because you just can't get enough of the big guy..",1416528000,,1835,4.372434017595308

5952672,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Hmm, where do I start. I'll start with that I loved Godzilla as a kid. Still love King Kong vs. Godzilla and enjoy most of the movies from the 1960's & 1970's. Not so with the 1980's version and definitely not the iguana movie that came out in the late 1990's. That said, when I heard a new Godzilla was coming out last year I was excited when I read that Bryan Cranston said this will make you forget all about the last one. While I never watched Breaking Bad, I have liked Cranston in other movies and thought he would do a good job in this.

So, after this version was released in the theaters I heard from some coworkers that this was only so so. While I never go by anyones reviews in regards to movies or television shows, I did not want to go to a theater and dump $30+ (ticket and the usual extras) for a so so movie. I decided to wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray and ordered it right away when it became available on Amazon.com. It arrived in the mail and I couldn't wait to see it in a few nights when I had the time.

Ok, here I go. I knew it would be the usual half hour plus of waiting for the full reveal of Godzilla. I don't enjoy mindless action movies so I do not mind the story having to be laid out first. Well, they kill off Bryan Cranston right away so I was left with not knowing who any of the actors were (I'm a little picky in my shows and movies). You start seeing the MUTO and the destruction it did (not by Godzilla as the movie teasers made it out to be). Then you see a tail of Godzilla, the spine of Godzilla, a fleeting glimpse of Godzilla as a door is closing, but not a full, daytime view of Godzilla for the world (well, movies fans) to see for a long time. I'm trying to be patient and then I look at the clock of how long the movie has been playing and it's almost and hour and there has not been one full view of Godzilla. I'm beginning to think, and some people agreed with me, that it would blow away the CGI budget if they were to show more full views of Godzilla throughout the movie. It was almost like the 90's version (all night time, quick glances) but minus the comedy inserted into it.

I always bail on movies when I know I am in trouble and it will not be my cup of tea. My internal detector usually goes off within 5 minutes and then I try to stick with it but end up shutting it off after a half hour or 45 minutes. I did that with the Matthew Broderick version but I fast forwarded through the last half hour (I rented that one). For this version, since I paid for it, and I liked the (advertised) look of Godzilla, I was going to stick through to the (bitter) end. Then I'm figuring out when there was 15 minutes left (including credits) that this was not going to get better and this was going to be at best a limited peek at seeing Godzilla. They should of called this MUTO because you sure as hell saw long crystal clear versions of that thing but at best you saw 2 really good views of Godzilla. The only other ones were at night when you are almost squinting to make out who Godzilla is. Then add it some of the plot (there was no reason for Ford Brody (Cranstons son) to find that kid on the train than to have him just run off to his parents at the settlement camp. No explanation, none. It was just like the director or producer said 'hey, let's throw in a random Asian person as a wink and a nod to the Japanese versions'.

I found the ending anti-climatic and was happy it was over. Almost 2 hours of this non-Godzilla Godzilla movie was more than enough. I take the $20 I paid for this as a loss because I'll never watch it again. At least it was not more because I avoided seeing this in the theaters.

As for the sequel in 2018, I was just excited when I heard of it, but that was before I saw this version. But now, I'll wait for it to come out on cable in 2019 or 2020 because this current version was simply not good.  As much as I like slow, story driven movies (Syriana, Munich), I wanted to see lots of Godzilla and lots of things being messed up. This one was poor at best.

Now if they make the sequel a remake of King Kong vs. Godzilla, I might change my mind.",1416268800,,4138,4.032886723507917

5952674,4,B00EXPOCXY,"At the rate director Gareth Edwards is improving as a filmmaker he should be quite good by the time we see his upcoming standalone Star Wars film in a couple years - he'd be perfect directing a live-action Star Wars with the giant zillo beast of The Clone Wars animated series. I still think he has a little trouble with human characters though as I thought he did in Monsters, but he has a knack for creature effects. It was nice to see him get to use more of those here on a larger scale, and while the big G doesn't take center stage immediately there is plenty of MUTO action leading up to the big finish. I'd say this is about on par with Del Toro's futuristic Pacific Rim except this one is more grounded in modern human capability, aside from the giant creatures, and doesn't get as campy. For me the creature effects were worth the price alone. It's not perfect and doesn't quite satisfy completely on a human level but this film puts Godzilla back on track without a doubt.",1416182400,,982,4.371584699453552
5952675,2,B00EXPOCXY,"This is more of like a 2 1/2 star review. I hated the fact the the father who spent all these years knowing and researching that something was going to happen again got killed earlier on. Then his son who basically treated him like he was crazy spends the whole movie following Godzilla and the weird enemy monster. I don't t know this Godzilla did not have any personality. In the old movies Godzilla would taunt and egg his enemies on and you were like "" Yeah! Tell em!"" But in this one he is this boring Dinosaur..Just things change I guess and not for the better. I did appreciate how they did not go cgi crazy, that makes me sick. I also did like that it looked like they used people in costumes at least for the enemy monster but all the whole you did not really get to see a lot of the monsters and when you did , it was dark.",1416182400,,833,4.085365853658536

One thing that disaster movies have against them these days:  the inescapable fact that they are so unrealistic about the true horror: the aftermath of insurance and legal bickering that will undoubtedly follow.  In fact, the sequel--to be realistic--should focus on the challenge of prosecuting a monolithic, non-communicating beast for all the wonton destruction and financial despair into which he cast that poor San Fran cityscape.  While the politicians promote him as a savior and job-creator, the real moneymen will point out the sheer costs incurred, not to mention the housing care and medical attention required for prosecuting a prisoner with such 'special needs'.

I'm not sure what the biggest failure of this Godzilla movie is, but there are many.

1) The Acting. The only good/interesting actor gets killed off early in a very unspectacular way. His son is incredibly annoying yet it's on his shoulders the rest of the movie lays. Sad to say, but Matthew Broderick (Godzilla 2000 flop) would have been much better.

2) The Plot. There seems to be a rambling series of events leading up to a ""climactic"" fight scene ending. It really makes you want to fast-forward through the meaningless movie. It took me 3 separate viewing occasions to get through the movie.

3) The Monster fighting. Godzilla's breath weapon looks pretty cool, but otherwise it looks like he's fighting 2 monster mosquitoes that he should easily be able to defeat.

4) The hype. I see now why no-info about this movie came out before it released in Theaters. They better run with this movie while it has legs and lots more bad-reviews continue to come out.

5952799,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I would give the film 3 and 1/2 stars, actually, because a 3-star film, to my thinking, signifies a decent, watchable, fun film (at most) and Edwards's 'Godzilla' delivered more than mere popcorn kicks, in my opinion. Overall, the film excels in some very important categories but fails spectacularly in a couple of crucial areas, which is why I would not consider it a truly wonderful 4 or 5 star vehicle. Nevertheless, Edwards has given us a striking, apocalyptic, often thrilling, and occasionally quite wondrous movie. I did not mind the relative paucity of ""screen time"" for my favorite movie-monster: the whole ""less-is-more/ tease-the-audience-'til-the-big-payoff"" approach works very well in films of such colossal and fantastical scope (see Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' for example). The iconic Toho traditions are honored brilliantly in the build-up and even when Godzilla isn't onscreen, one gets a deliciously tense and palpable sense of his presence at the edge of the story, lurking, on his way. Edwards and the writers did a great job establishing this kind of ambience in the first portion of the flick.

Bryan Cranston and the excellent Juliette Binoche kept me riveted to the screen from the first. ""This is going to be a REAL movie,"" I thought. Well, it was a movie. Without spoiling anything, I'll say how utterly lamentable it was that this film did not stick with Cranston and Binoche as the main players and somehow build the story around those two, the way that American distributors did by inserting Raymond Burr very cleverly into the narrative for the USA release of the original, uber-classic 'Godzilla' in the 1950s. The plot and pacing went off-the-boil very quickly after the departure of Cranston, and, nothing against Taylor-Johnson, but he did not have the lines, the narrative drive, or the screen presence to carry the human dimension of the film after that. No one else did, either. The promising plot devolved into a hodgepodge of disconnected scenes and plot hole-strewn set-ups ostensibly intended to make us keep caring about the people. Sorry. No dice.

I am the kind of longtime fan, however, who can still appreciate a good monster dust-up for what it is -- pure spectacle. The film never stopped delivering in terms of spectacle, and it did so on a grand scale! The sound was awe-inspiring, the set-pieces mostly stunning, and the monsters themselves were superb in every way. In the end I was proud to see a Godzilla blockbuster worthy of the canon, and one that so easily erased the bad taste of Emmerich's 1990s abomination. That being said, even in the kookiest, cheesiest, most shoestring-y Godzilla flicks from Toho, the writers found a way to somehow always make me care about what was happening to the people from the monster's grand point of view ... and make me care about the monsters from the people's point of view. It doesn't require poetry, in terms of storytelling -- just a touch of narrative common sense.

A frightening amount of money was spent on this movie to have it end-up with a stilted, crappy script and muddy storyline. There's no excuse for that, but as I said before, Cranston, Binoche, and, to a lesser extent, the mere presence of Ken Watanabe, got things off to one heck of a fabulous start. The rest somehow added-up to a fine, rip-roaring monster movie. I am going to recommend it with a good heart and fully expect that the sequel will be even better. No matter what, this is a MUST-OWN for sci-fi fans and a no-brainer for anyone devoted to the Big G. * * * & 1/2",1415664000,2,3566,4.842622950819672

5952817,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I have been a huge Godzilla fan since I was just a kid. I made it one of my life's ambitions to see every one of the movies, and I watched Godzilla vs. Megalon so many times that the tape wore out and I had to get a new one. When the 1998 re-imagining from Roland Emmerich came out, my kid-self was quite entertained with it initially as an action film, but as the years rolled on I quickly came to realize that it was not a real Godzilla movie, and it did not stand the test of time at all.

Fortunately, the new reboot of Godzilla from Gareth Edwards is a proper Godzilla through and through. This is the return of the true Godzilla, who I spent a good sized chunk of my childhood obsessing over. There's been some criticism that this film supposedly did not have enough Godzilla in it, but my counterargument is that the film is paced just like the classic Toho films. In the old films, Godzilla usually showed up about half-way through, and most of the films would be shown from the perspective of human characters-- in a 90 minute Godzilla film, you'd typically only have a few minutes of Godzilla himself, but that is part of what made his character seem so much larger than life.

I gotta say, seeing Godzilla in all his glory again for that first moment, and hearing the booming, updated version of his iconic roar brought a tear to my eye. Godzilla was one of my childhood heroes, and with the new visual effects making him look more real than ever, the experience was almost like seeing Superman or even Jesus in a movie for the first time. If for nothing else, I have to give this movie 5 stars for that.",1415664000,46,1615,4.309210526315789

This reimagining of Godzilla certainly pays homage to the old Japanese films, but it's ultimately lacking in any depth as far as its message is concerned, which takes a sharp departure from its predecessors. The stunning CGI with which Godzilla is rendered offers a new and exhilarating experience for lovers of large monster flicks, or even the classic Godzilla films; quality animation abounds, and it even presents the audience with a few moments in which to appreciate the subtler emotions and facial features of the towering monster--not unlike Peter Jackson's King Kong. The carnage these monsters create is truly incredible, and we are given the opportunity to experience their sheer size and power in ways that the classic films couldn't quite create. Unfortunately, however, we are presented with a surprisingly small number of opportunities to appreciate the monster's magnitude and enormity; given that this is a film about Godzilla, we see him relatively infrequently. The human characters' storylines were forgettable, unfortunately. The character with the most humanity might be, in fact, Godzilla himself (or herself).",1415577600,,1273,5.402010050251256

Having written before about the symbolism of Godzilla (or more properly, Gojira) to the Japanese post-WW-II as a personification of the A-bomb, I won't go into that again.  I had hopes this would be a far more interesting Godzilla film, whatever the critics said.  After all, this WAS 2013, right?  And a lot of money was put into its production.  Surely wed at least see a good monster, even if the story were lame?
Well in my world, the creatures did not make up for the story.  There is an attempt to capture human interest here, focused on Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody.  My explanation may be more coherent than the movie: Brodys father was present at the destruction of a Japanese power plant (I wanted to see people running around in TEPCO hats and uniforms) and his wife dies there.  Dad stays in Japan, trying to figure out what really happened because he KNOWS it wasn't a regular earthquake and that officials are covering something up.  Son Ford returns to the US, marries a blue-eyed blonde played by Elizabeth Olson, and becomes a weapons-disposal expert in the military [which of course will come in handy later].  And they have a young boy named Sam.  And of course, if not for Brody, civilization might not existits one of THOSE plots.

This movie scored viewer ratings all across the board, with the largest clustering at 5/5 at Amazon, but 16% hated it, so its composite score was 3.5/5 stars: only fair.

In the story the Japanese disaster, Fukushima, wasn't a meltdown at all, it was a MUTO attack [think of Mothra, I guess, but MUTO if you were wondering, stands for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism-which is an inapt acronym for Godzillas foes, since they don't just romp around ON land, and UNDER the land, but under the water and in the air too].  The theory of the movie this time is that millions of years ago radiation levels were much higher [which makes sense since radioactivity naturally declines over time].  Im assuming Godzilla and the other MUTOs predated our most famous dinosaurs, and had evolved to---wait for it---use radioactive materials as FUEL.  [Hence Godzillas atomic-breath weapon].  This version of Godzilla compared to the last US version of 1999, shows the same progression as the Japanese films: Godzilla morphs from threat to mankind to its salvation.  A male and female pair of MUTOs are awakened, and their presence attracts Godzilla back from the deep, since they are ancient rivals...

The actors all look as if they wish they could run off the set and never come back.  The dialog is lame.  The scene sequencing is erratic, and manages to make you wonder if the director was drunk during the entire filming.  Then I read the theatre version was STUDIO-CUT: ahhh, so THATS why its so bad, is it?

The visuals are decent, though I was surprised how much took place at NIGHT, which cuts down quite a bit on how much detail you have to show.

The film stoops as low as rousing a cheap scare by a BIRD hitting a bus or a train window [I cant even remember which] making you think a monster is starting to attack.  And if, as so described, Godzilla or Gojira was the ""alpha-predator"" of his age, why then does he have such a problem when a male-female PAIR of MUTOs are fighting him, as one woud expect?

Nevertheless it doesn't have to make deep sense---it's GODZILLA!  I read one critic review claiming he seemed PAUNCHY in his MIDDLE AGE, and perhaps wanted nothing more than a good nap.  I think that was a bit unfair.  This is a good rendition of Godzilla, plus 2 new competitors.  There are plenty of scenes that adolescent kids, I think, will feel were ""AWESOME""!

This film is a far better remake than that dreadful Matthew Broderick vehicle. It is far more in keeping with the spirit of the first ""Gojira"" film in Japanese. On the whole, it is well acted and edited. The film is visually stunning at appropriate times, often surprising the viewer. The monsters are well thought out and well designed in CGI. The special effects and CGI generally are quite good. They work hand-in-hand with the plotline instead of substituting for one as in so many films today.

The film begins with Bryan Cranston (of Breaking Bad) as an engineer with a Japanese electricity firm bringing a new nuclear reactor on line when, suddenly, what appear to be earthquakes bring the new plant to destruction, killing the wife of Cranston and mother of the young Aaron Johnson. Fast forward fifteen years - Cranston doggedly continues to search for the true cause of his wife's death. Cranston and Johnson (now a US Army demolitions expert) find themselves in the cover-up of a phenomena so frightening governments have kept it secret for decades. Then, this secret explodes upon the world stage.

For the most part, the film is well-acted. Cranston and Watanabe do well, but unfortunately their roles are short lived or intermittent. I haven't seen Aaron Johnson in any other roles, but in this one, his performance was wooden and unenthusiastic. Though the special effects and CGI are excellent, there is little monster vs. monster fighting and the bulk of the film focuses on the weak link of the film - Johnson's role. I longed to see more of Godzilla fighting the Mutos but there were only brief scenes of combat between the leviathan's.

The film, as a whole, was very satisfying. I thought the plot was well-thought out and executed cinematically. This film has no language or nudity and no one will miss it. Even though I longed for more visuals of Godzilla and was mildly disappointed by the lackluster performance by Aaron Johnson, I still found myself surprised by the film at several points and it always held my attention. It's a good film and I recommend it with a solid four-star rating.",1415404800,4,2306,4.815656565656566

This famous speech by Robert Oppenheimer was used for the teaser trailer for Godzilla 2014. I suppose we all thought that, one way or another in 1954 we awakened something which shocked the world in horror we try to bury it in history the worlds dark secrets with our most powerful weapons then in 2014 that same horror come back to shock us again this film is the best Americanized version of Godzilla. In Japan we have had 28 Beautiful Godzilla films that are good, strange, excellent, and awesome in America before this film we had one film which was so horrible that I have lost faith in an Americanized Godzilla film until this film came out which restored my faith in it.  Now Ill be reviewing both the movie and the official Novelization as one review. With that said lets review Godzilla 2014 and See if it holds up better than the 1998

(Godzilla 2014) 2014

The film is directed by Gareth Edwards, and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston. The screenplay is credited to Max Borenstein but includes contributions from David Callaham, David S. Goyer, Drew Pearce, and Frank Darabont.

Story: The film and the novel begins with film reels showing 1954 the preparation and the detonation of a nuclear bomb test at Bikini Atoll the preparation and detonation of a nuclear bomb at Bikini Atoll. A huge figure with jagged spikes rises from the water when the bomb is detonated. 45 Years later, in 1999, Doctor Ichiro Serizawa is called to a mining site in the Philippines along with his assistant, Doctor Vivienne Graham. They heard that a mining crew may have found a radiation pocket as they were preparing to use heavy machinery the floor of the valley collapsed into the cavern bellow and 40 miners went down with it. (In the book Dr Serizawa asked to talk to the survivors and they're all in a Hospital. The survivors all have radiation poisoning and the doctors nurses Dr Graham Doctor Serizawa are wearing hazmat suits but one of them says to Dr Serizawa with a Nurse translating. The man says that people like you came here they have damaged the earth and now she has released a demon.) With a small team, he finds a colossal fossilized skeleton and two spores in a large underground cave. Vivienne asks Serizawa if it was him with his response to no its far older. One of the spores is found already hatched and a tunnel extends to the surface from its location, followed a large trail that, in turn, extends to the ocean, Days later, nuclear physicist Joseph Brody and his wife, Sandra Brody, go to work at a nuclear power plant in the city of Janjira near Tokyo. Sandra assembles a team to perform a check, under Joe's supervision. The power plant is soon breached by an explosion and radiation leak, killing Sandra and her team and leaving Joe and their son, Ford, alone. The event is attributed to a large earthquake, and the Janjira area is evacuated and subsequently quarantined. 15 years after the incident, Ford is now an explosive disposal officer for the United States Navy, and is living in San Francisco, California with his wife Elle and son Sam. After returning home, he finds out that Joe was arrested for trespassing in Janjira while looking for an explanation for the catastrophic event years ago. After Ford travels to Japan and bails him out, Joe convinces him to come with him to another trip to Janjira, for Sandra's sake. They soon discover it is not radioactive (as it was supposedly claimed) and, after recovering Joe's old data and finding their old home, they are caught and arrested by security and taken to the power plant. The power plant now houses a large laboratory for studying a mysterious and strange chrysalis/Cocoon similar to the one discovered in the Philippines. Joe is being questioned on what he was doing there where Joe is replying that he knows that MONARCH is hiding something out there covering it up lying he says that whatever it is killed his wife and he deserves answers along with whatever it is it will send them back to the Stone Age. It turns out to be the hatchling from the previously discovered spore and started to break out of the chrysalis/Cocoon the use electric shock to kill it but then the creature breaks out of the chrysalis/Cocoon wreaking havoc on the lab, killing and injuring many of the personnel during the chaos Joe receives fatally heavy wounds. After the monster flies away the military then examines the area takes Serizawa to the USS Saratoga, who requests that Joe and Ford accompany him on the way, wanting to know what they knew about the situation. Joe later dies from his injuries in the helicopter while en route to the USS Saratoga. On the Saratoga, Serizawa and Graham, explain that in 1954 by a nuclear submarine accident they awakened an ancient alpha predator older than mankind called Gojira/Godzilla based on an old island myth about a mythical King of Monsters. They explain that it was part of ancient race of dinosaur from a time when the world was filled with nuclear radiation it fed off  this radiation and radioactive materials, when Earth's radiation was subsiding creatures of that time period either hid underground or under the ocean to feed of the Earths core. Throughout the mid-1950s, the United States and Russian militaries used nuclear weapons in attempts to kill Godzilla and covered them up as atomic tests thus; his existence was unknown to the public. Godzilla, however, survived every attempt. Dr Serizawa shows Ford footage of the preparation and the detonation of a nuclear bomb at Bikini Atoll one such attempt at Godzilla's destruction  the numerous failed attempts to kill him with nuclear weaponry and the subsequent cover-up stories. They explain to Ford that 15 years ago they found a skeleton of a creature similar to Gojira they had found an inactive spore along with another one that has hatched it also escaped its hatching area then headed towards the Janjira Nuclear Planet. At first Ford thought of Gojira as a monster but Dr Graham says or a god for all intense and purposes. They revealed to be part of a secret organization called MONARCH, to study Godzilla and possibility other Monsters. The monster is now referred to as M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), they explain that its ancient origins and that it feeds on radiation and radioactive materials, moving underground and putting itself in a cryptobiotic state when Earth's radiation subsided. Ford informs Serizawa of what his father knows, explaining that Joe mentioned tracking a form of echolocation within Janjira, leading the team to think that the M.U.T.O. was communicating with something. Ford is then taken to Honolulu, Hawaii to eventually return to San Francisco.(In the book  They give Joe Brody a navel burial and Dr Serizawa sees Ford off to Hawaii) In the midst of a dense forest in Honolulu, a US Navy Special Forces team finds the wrecked remains of a Russian nuclear submarine that, earlier, reported an attack. While there, the winged M.U.T.O. arrives on the island, ripping apart the submarine and feeding on its reactor. After being threatened by the military it sends out an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down all electronics within miles. Meanwhile, Ford is boarding a train, where he witnesses a young boy named Akio being separated from his parents. Ford, holding Akio, assures his parents that he will return their son he gives Akio his small military action figure which cause the M.U.T.O., to activate his EMP abilities which effect all of Honolulu. the train comes to a standstill for a moment due to EMP. Before the power returns on a different side of the city, Dr Serizawa is on top the USS Saratoga then he turns to see Godzilla's arrival creates a tsunami which destroys a small coastal area. After the EMP caused by the M.U.T.O., Ford and Akio are almost killed by the M.U.T.O., which bites into the tracks and causes the train to derail and hang.  The M.U.T.O.'s actions start a chain reaction that leads to mass destruction at Honolulu International Airport, where Godzilla arrives. After a brief fight, the M.U.T.O. flies off with Godzilla pursuing him, and the two monsters are no longer a secret footage of the brawl airs in the news, which Elle and Sam witness. (In the book Ford and Akio watch Godzilla battle the Winged MUTO using his atomic breath a little earlier than expected in the film before we cut to Sam and Elle.) Serizawa reports that Godzilla appeared because he was listening in on them then heard an echolocation signal and is hunting the M.U.T.O. They later question why the M.U.T.O. would send out a signal, and soon realize that the M.U.T.O was calling to the other spore is either unhatched or hatched and is taken to Mount Yucca in Nevada, United States, and placed in the nuclear waste repository. The result is the hatchling is much larger in size than the first, it has then  broken out of the repository and started attacking Las Vegas, Nevada. The team concludes that the new M.U.T.O. is female and the winged one is a male and that they plan on nesting in San Francisco. The military proposes an idea that involves attracting the monsters to a nuclear warhead and detonating it in the ocean. Serizawa disapproves, saying that Godzilla is the only thing that could stop the M.U.T.O.s. Ford, now on the mainland, journeys on a military train with a group of soldiers to get Elle and Sam out of San Francisco. The train contained two ICBMs, both armed warheads which were hoped to be strong enough to kill all three monsters. The train, however, is destroyed by the female eight-legged M.U.T.O. (who was resting on the Cliffside) and Ford is found the next morning, left as the only survivor with a surviving Nuclear warhead. The warhead is then flown by helicopter to San Francisco bay to be transported to a small frigate before Godzilla arrives. At this time, citizens in San Francisco are being evacuated on school buses. Elle leaves Sam with a trusted friend while she stays behind to help around in the hospital. (In the book Elle loses Sam when he hopes to see his father but he gets lost and his mother finds him and has Laura watch him.)The buses then make their way out of the city through the Golden Gate Bridge, where it is blocked off and is surrounded by the military. Godzilla resurfaces near the bridge, where the NAVY opens fire in an attempt to prevent him from entering the city, despite the protests of the soldiers on the bridge due to the presence of civilians. The commotion caused by both the military and Godzilla results in the destruction of the bridge, killing and injuring many people and only leaving Sam's bus intact. The male M.U.T.O. arrives minutes later and steals the warhead immediately after it is armed to go off.  Realizing that Godzilla may be the only thing capable of stopping the M.U.T.O.s, the military allow him to proceed into the city. (In the book Godzilla destroys the bridge while being attacked and Sam is scared of Godzilla but he supports the monster also Godzilla battles Fighter planes while smashing up Alcatraz Island which wasn't brought up in the film.)The M.U.T.O.s meet in downtown San Francisco and start building their nest after a short mating ritual. The male M.U.T.O. is attacked by Godzilla and another conflict ensues. Ford is ordered to go on a HALO drop with a team in order to retrieve the warhead from the M.U.T.O. nest and turn it off so it does not detonate in the city's center. (Before that Ford is reunited with Sam but he wants to get his wife out Sam wants to go with him but Ford doesnt want him to but he tells him that he and his mother are the only thing in this world he wants to live for then he promises Sam that he was going to get his mother and gives him his military action figure which he didn't give to Akio also Dr Serizawa gives Ford the picture of his mom dad and himself before he goes on the HALO jump while saying that they would be proud of him.) After parachuting into the city they quickly locate the nest. The female M.U.T.O. goes to assist the male against Godzilla, giving the team the perfect time to locate the warhead. (Its vice versa with the movie as Godzilla beating up the female MUTO due to her making a nest and laying her eggs with the Male MUTO coming to save her.) After finding it and getting out of the nest,The team gets the bomb down and realize they cannot open it to disarm the warhead, and devise a plan to sail it out into the ocean, far enough to not endanger the population. Ford stays then, using a damaged fuel truck, destroys the nest of eggs before the baby M.U.T.O.s could hatch. This attracts the female M.U.T.O.'s attention and Ford is nearly killed, however Godzilla dorsal plates start to glow blue then he unleashes his atomic breath knocking her back with two strikes from the beam. (In the Book Godzilla unleashes a powerful Atomic Breath on the Female Muto blasting her into a building but then he cant use another atomic breath again for awhile.) Godzilla then kills the Male MUTO by slamming it into a building using his tail, impaling his chest on the debris. The building then collapses, pinning Godzilla underneath a pile of rubble and dust. (In the book after beating the male Muto Godzilla slowly collapses due to the wounds on his neck and his dorsal plates)  While loading it onto a boat, the female M.U.T.O. attacks and kills all of the soldiers except Ford. Ford starts to drive the boat, but he is confronted by the female MUTO. Wounded and exhausted, he attempts to hold her back with his sidearm. (In the Book Ford is collapsing due to blood loss and he molds his fingers into a gun then says POW at the Female MUTO who gets close to him before Godzilla kills the Female Muto.) However, Godzilla returns and grabs the M.U.T.O. by her neck attempting to rip her jaw off. After a brief struggle, Godzilla then holds the female M.U.T.O.'s mouth open then blasts a charged atomic ray into her throat, which causes her neck to explode, ultimately decapitating and killing her.(In the book Godzilla blasts Atomic breath down her throat then decapitates her with just one claw.) Exhausted/Drained of energy Godzilla throws her head in the water and then he collapses on the city's shoreline. (In the book Godzilla collapses in San Francisco Bay) Ford is rescued by helicopters before the warhead detonates out into the sea. The next day, during the aftermath of the chaos, Ford is reunited with Sam before being reunited with Elle. (The city has been damaged with Godzilla covered in city building ruins) Godzilla is assumed dead until he wakes up in the morning the media acknowledges Godzilla's actions, hailing him as ""King of the Monsters"".(In the Book Godzilla does have a wound on his neck healed but  it leaves a scar on it.) Godzilla lets out a final roar before returning to the ocean to lay dormant once again.

This movie is a really great Americanized Godzilla film much better than the 1998 monstrosity.

The tone feels like Raymond Burrs speech in Godzilla 1985. Nature has a way sometimes of reminding man of just how small he is. She occasionally throws up the terrible offspring of our pride and carelessness to remind us of how puny we really are in the face of a tornado, an earthquake or a Godzilla. The reckless ambitions of man are often dwarfed by their dangerous consequences. For now, Godzilla, that strangely innocent and tragic monster, has gone to earth. Whether he returns or not or is never again seen by human eyes, the things he has taught us remain. The film has lots of throw backs to the Godzilla films of old including the 1954 film.

Characters: each of the characters has some really good development. Joe Brody is a really great character he has lost his wife Sandra to an accident until it is confirmed that she was killed by the MUTO. In previous Godzilla films we had characters like Professor Hayashida from Godzilla 1984, andAdmiral Tachibana from GMK, are examples of people who have lost their families to Godzilla. Joe Brody has great character in this film after he has lost his wife he still has regret for sending her down there and he doesnt have a single picture of her until he and Ford go back to their house. Some people think that he should have stayed longer but its fine. Admiral William Stenz is a good military character for trying to prevent civilians from losing their lives to the monsters. Dr Ichiro Serizawa is a good character I think hes the son of Dr Daisuke Serizawa in the Godzilla Awakening comic. He believes Godzilla is a god or a monster that nature had awakened to restore the balance that mankind had caused he also believes that Godzilla will destroy the MUTOs but he does bring up an excellent point in the book when they are discussing using a megaton nuclear weapon on the monsters then Dr Serizawa mentions to Admiral Stenz that Godzilla has been down in the ocean having no interest in our world but hes been a part of the balance if we kill him theres no telling of the aftereffect. I do like the line he says in both the movie and the book with Nature having an order a power to restore balance and they should let the monsters fight. Ford has some good characterization to him he at first doesnt believe his father from what he said that may have happened then after his encounter with the Male MUTO along with losing his father then he learns from Dr Serizawa that there was another giant monster before all of this then he sees said monster fighting in Honolulu. I do like how after Godzilla beats the Male MUTO you get to see them making eye contact with each other it looks like he can see Godzillas anger of hatred at humanity. Most of the other characters have better characterization in the book.

Monsters: The Monsters there are 2 of them but since this movie is good I am reviewing all 3 monsters with the Male MUTO being first then the Female MUTO and Godzilla will be last. The Male MUTO is an interesting creature along with the female they each have a similarity to Godzilla in terms of traits they feed off nuclear energy. The Male MUTO is smaller than the female which in my opinion works for it at first I thought the male was the big one and the female was the one that flies but after seeing the movie 3 times and reading the official novelization people at first thought it was Rodan but it isnt. The Male MUTO reminds me of three other Monsters I think of Gyaos, Battra, and little bit of the Cloverfield monster the abilities it has is emitting an Electromagnetic Pulse(EMP) which works for the MUTOs finally I like then design. The Female MUTO is much bigger than the male but I like that but when both MUTOS are on screen they have a really good connection with each other  The Female MUTO reminds me of Orga and overall I like the design of both MUTOS. Godzilla is massive in this movie hes 108 meters tall while the origin is a little different I like it its similar to the Showas Gamera Origin but much different. Godzillas atomic breath looks really good while I liked the classic atomic breath effect it looks good. At first when I saw the model for this Godzilla at first I didn't like the feet but now that Ive seen the movie I like how the feet are. The roar sounds like the Heisei Godzilla and the Godzilla 2000 roar. Godzillas design is really good it looks like a mix of the 1954, Heisei, Millennium and a little bit of the always on third street 2 Godzilla design. I like how Godzilla is overall.

Music: Alexandre Desplat hasn't composed a giant monster movie before but for his first attempt its good. At first the movie gave off a small horror element but I wished they had included one of Akira Ifukubes music or try to compose a new Godzilla theme like Akira Ifukubes over time its good overall.

All this digital technology  and special effects, and we have Godzilla fighting in the murky dark? That's unforgivable. I'd rather watch the old school Japanese movies with the rubber suited monsters that fought in the daylight over models because at least I could see that.

5953115,1,B00EXPOCXY,"My god, where do I start.  I had high hopes for this movie.  I could almost forgive the asinine plot , after all it's a Godzilla movie.  All action movies have asinine plots.  But this one pushes it's luck to bottom feed and wallow in its absurdities and excuses for bad drama.  The radioactive cloud chasing Juliette Binoche is visible?  The 2nd blast door has to close at a painfully slow speed so bad drama can ensue?  Bryan Cranston's character has to rant when he was detained earlier.  Zip Drives still work after being left out and weathered / soiled /etc. for 20 years?  The place just happens to have a Zip drive unit handy.  The bomb disposal guy's wife (Olsen) has her phone set to vibrate and yet she's urgently awaiting news that he's alive and safe???  ad infinitum.  The movie is boring, it's tedious and it's visually so dark you have trouble figuring out what's going on for the last hour of the movie.

I liked Bryan Cranston's cameo in Argo.  I would like to think he didn't need to take this role as a ""paycheck"" movie.  But he can't do much with the screenplay he's given.  The same for Watanabe.  I just feel embarrassed for the actors here.

If you want to know what's really wrong with this movie look up ""Godzilla 2014"" at Movie Sins where they catalog the litany of fail here.

This movie makes Transformers and Ishtar look like high art.

I thought the battles were fun, and I thought the story was decent enough from a conceptual standpoint. That being said, from an artistic/filmmaking stance, the story was very poorly told, the dialogue was particularly weak, and the characters we're not believable, both for the reasons listed above but mainly for poor casting choices in my opinion. Bryan Cranston's character was the most dynamic and captivating part of the film. If you watch it you'll likely see how they screw that up. Aaron Taylor Johnson, while I've liked him in other films, I thought was way too much of a wet noodle for this role. I'm just saying that while, yes, the film paid homage to the Godzilla franchise and had a decent concept for a story, it was, as a whole, a very poorly executed film and I would not consider this anything worth writing home about. That being said, there were some great visuals and a few pretty cool moments, but that's about all this film had going for it. I just wanted to give some persepctive as a filmmaker who is neither a die-hard Godzilla fan or a Blockbuster junkie.

I have not been one who has been a fan of the Godzilla movies as I looked at the old Japanese movies with mostly amusement when I was a kid.  But I was willing to give this a chance and see what modern movie making could do for the genre and the story.

Unfortunately this movie was mostly scenes of extreme tediousness and boredom for me.  Both me and the wife fell asleep part way through and had to rewind to see what we missed.  We missed mostly nothing but boring dark scenes.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers here as I don't understand why most of the scenes were filmed in almost total darkness.  Most of the details, I couldn't even see what was going on in some of the monster scenes as they were so dark it was ridiculous.  Not sure if this was a way to save on CG costs or what but they definitely didn't invest the money saved on making a good exciting story.  Definitely a disappointment as I thought with a modern update, this could have been made a fun exciting action movie.  Instead they made mostly a snooze fest.  Hmm maybe that's why it was filmed so dark...to allow the viewers to nap.  2 stars",1414800000,2,1228,4.291304347826087

5953187,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I can finally write a review about this film as I was actually able to stay awake and watch it once all the way through. Normally I do not fall asleep half-way through a movie, but this one did it to me. I suppose the title screen appearing from the nuclear fallout in tiny black letters ""Godzilla"" should have warned me that the movie was going to undermine the whole idea of what a Kaiju movie is about. I have watched Kaiju movies all my life as a kid (Godzilla, Rodan, Gamera, etc.) and was ready to see another update and see how they did. Time and time again, these new movies simply do not stand the test of time, or even the first showing unfortunately.

I watch a variety of movies and have no issue with movies that present what they are supposed to present. But this movie kind of feels like, as an example, going to a movie called ""Rocky"" and seeing a rendition of the Nutcracker ballet with a half shadowed and barely seen banner of Sylvester Stallone wearing boxing gloves way off in the background. You go wanting to see a Godzilla movie, and all you see are random people running around doing random things in a disaster. You feel lucky to stay awake long enough to actually see a glimpse of a critter called Godzilla swimming around or dumbly standing around while he is getting shot at.

I do agree that that the director did a fair job with the MUTO creatures and the human side of the story (heck, he even made MUTO emotional where you felt sorry for them and identified with them more than with the humans or Godzilla). The CGI effects were very well done, so kudos to the special effects team. The music and sound effects were well done and appropriate for a Kaiju movie. What fell through was the overwhelming abundance of environmental special effects though. It seemed that everything was being done to hide and obscure and underwhelm every time a scene with the title character in it started. Another issue was that the human element of man loses family, man fights to find family, man finds family, became the main theme of the story rather than the title character. Focus was never really on Godzilla, rather on the people, if you could even see anything at all during most of the movie. It is one thing to make a scene at night, or with environmental effects, another altogether to make such scenes work to enable the audience to ""be there"" despite the environmental effects.

All in all it was a good movie if you are interested in a human story driven by disaster drama, but very sleep inducing if you are expecting any kind of real attempt at making a Godzilla movie. Every time I saw a glimpse of Godzilla, my expectations almost went up, then were dashed away when the scene cut away to people watching Godzilla from afar or on television, placing the Kaiju quite deliberately as background and incidental, not as the main story driving element. That kind of thing works well in sci-fi horror like Alien, not in an in-your-face Kaiju movie. Godzilla is intended to be in-yo-face and up close and personal, the center of attention. That is his character. (The creature called Godzilla in this movie had no personality, no emotion, and no story, he was just there, that feeling deriving from little to no time on screen). The creature in this movie was just as much NOT Godzilla as the ""Zilla"" thing in that 1998 movie also miss-titled Godzilla. He looked more like the original concept of Godzilla, but the CHARACTER was not in the story.

I know there are some people that got into this movie and liked it, and that is great. It appealed to them in some manner (I understand that directors are trying to reach as many audiences as possible by telling many stories in one, but that sometimes becomes an incoherent mess). If you are an avid Godzilla movie watcher, you will likely not get your fix here.",1414800000,,3835,4.529581529581529

The script could have been better though I agree. They could have used much more Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and MUCH less Aaron Taylor (I don't blame him as he didn't get much to do). I wish Elizabeth Olsen had a bigger and better role too.

But I went to watch the movie because of Godzilla and the MUTOs and I exited the theater satisfied and happy with what I saw.

This movie made me happy.",1414713600,,830,4.434210526315789

5953278,4,B00EXPOCXY,"From my perspective, this is just about the best film that it could be. It's visually breathtaking and has terrific atmosphere. The tension builds slowly and ominously, and when the monsters are revealed, they are superb, huge dark and...monstrous. The cinematographic, especially the angles and shot selection, is dead-on appropriate for this film. Excellent work there. The human characters are solid, if not much more than that. They fulfill their purpose, which is to provide the human perspective in the film, without getting in the way of what it's really about.

Some reviewers are suggesting that this film is for old-school Godzilla-type fans, and they are probably right, but I have not watched the older films and I really enjoyed this one. The thing is, the key to this film is not ""monster action"" per se, but suspense and atmosphere. There is great action, but like the original Jurassic Park, that is not this film's true strength. Or compare this to a  Hulk film--if you are primarily interested in seeing the Hulk (Godzilla in this case) smashing things, then this film may not give you enough of what you want. However, if you find Bruce Banner (the establishing of context and building of tension in this case) interesting, then this may be more to your liking.",1414627200,,1280,4.921296296296297

5953282,3,B00EXPOCXY,"The King Of The Monsters returns for the 60th anniversary of his historic debut for a gargantuan battle against not 1, but 2 opponents! And the results are... Okay. For a film which clocks in at a little over 2 hours, Godzilla is present for only about 10 minutes and something seconds of screen time. I don't mean the climax, but over the entire span of this 2 hour film titled Godzilla. Now, this film isn't a bad film, but most of the film is comprised of people talking, but only when they are not staring in silence... or sitting in silence. Ive seen it several times, and this is really what most of this film is.
The most interesting characters are those played by Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston, both of whom's talents are wasted here. They play minimal roles at best, and we are left with only the guy from kickass to carry the movie, and his acting skills aren't strong enough to justify his amount of screen time, which should have been given to the other two if not Godzilla.
That being said, the film does get some things right, and when it does it is quite magnificent. The cinematography is beautiful, and really gives the film a grandiose presentation. The effects are quite good, especially Godzilla. The animators did a great job of giving Godzilla a lifelike, almost sentient feel. his facial expressions are handled quite well, as are his movements when he engages his enemies. The build up to his appearances are truly the best parts of this film (aside from the monster-on-monster violence) but this is also were the film once again falls flat, as there is little payoff when Godzilla finally makes his first appearance, which wouldn't be so bad if the finale didn't also makes an attempt to hide Godzilla from us as well.
All in all, this film is not to great or to terrible. Not really a great film for kids, not because of content, but for lack thereof. Kids will most likely get bored, and the human element is not well done enough for adults to really get anything out of it except take a nap. This is a monster film which takes itself to serious, and falls flat in doing so. The creative minds behind this film seemed to think they were making something thought provoking and/or something of a higher caliber than what they viewed Godzilla films to be but weren't as talented or as thoughtful as the team behind the original 1954 film. Maybe you'll find some kind of satisfaction in watching It, but for me personally, the payoff isn't really worth the wait.",1414540800,4,2487,4.553571428571429

5953378,4,B00EXPOCXY,"At least this is my own dear Godzilllla again as I can recognise him. In the last representation we had a post-war egg-laying impostor spawned by nuclear bomb tests in the south Pacific. This time he is actually an ancient god, older than mankind, and the nuclear explosions were apparently attempts to destroy him because nobody knew what he was.

For me, what matters is that this Godzilla looks right. He is a goody this time, as he became in the Japanese series where he fought off this or that hostile creature. I first saw him in Godzilla v The Thing, he was a baddy at that time, but baddy/goody its OK by me so long as he looks the part. Not that you see a lot of him in this film, and I can understand how that upsets some viewers. Most of the early footage of him is just his famous two rows of dorsal spines showing above the water. Before the final battle I saw one definite shot of him in darkness, and possibly another, but that was just giving us enough to reassure us that he was the real deal. In fact this film relies very heavily, probably too heavily, on dim glimpses through darkness, a bit like Cloverfield although this is a bigger-budget effort that does not have to rely on the technique so much. The two radioactive monsters don't get a lot of daylight exposure either, and even the final denouement featuring all three of them takes place after dark.

I cant work up much emotion about how successful this basic way of doing it is. Obviously it is going to work for some viewers and not for others, and I don't see any need for an e-battle over that. Even the real on-screen battle consists of just more glimpses, but this time it lets us see Godzillas flame-breath being deployed on the nasties. It all leaves him temporarily exhausted, but theres nothing to worry about, as he gets to his feet, raises his head skywards, lets out one triumphant squawk and descends into the limitless and pathless ocean as a grateful crowd wish him a sentimental farewell. This is in full daylight, the climax that the whole story has been leading up to, whether one thinks the process successful or not.

This way of telling a Godzilla story presumes that he now has his place in folk culture, I suppose. These days a Dracula film doesnt have to go to lengths to tell the public who Dracula is, and Id buy it that the same can go for Godzilla. Some viewers are bound to be newcomers to these respective stories, but after enough time has gone by they cant expect traditional storylines to be methodically explained for their benefit. This particular story is also best understood as a simple monster movie, Id say. Allegories of human foolishness in nuclear matters are too obvious to need emphasis. This time the attempts go awry to deal by means of nukes with the creatures whose diet of nuclear wastes gives them mega-destructive electro-magnetic-pulse capabilities, and the admiral in charge has to follow the advice of a solemn-faced old professor who has some mystical understanding of who Godzilla is and how he can restore balance to human destiny. One interesting piece of explanation is that the EMP-creatures were not blown up in the ordinary way because that would have released the radioactive material they contained. That is very understandable, because you cant destroy radioactive actinides, you can only take them somewhere else.  In that case what did Godzilla do? We are not told, but, like I say, this is just a monster movie so don't ask.

5953462,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Out of all of the Godzilla movies I've seen thus far (I've watched them all), this one is by far one of my all times favorites. I dare say this movie may even be my favorite. The way the director managed to create the world around Godzilla and set up the M.U.T.Os in such a way that created tension throughout the movie. The atmosphere and the mood of the film are excellently built up all the way til the climax of the movie, which together, make the final confrontation very satisfying.

The main character is kind of boring (his family can be easily removed from the movie and the movie would not change much). The actor playing Ford could have done a much better job bringing the character to life, so that the audience might actually feel something for him, so that they could care about his safety.

Pros: Great build up, Excellent cinematography, Amazing atmosphere, Godzilla looked fantastic (imo); he has the general look of Godzilla with an added blend of Bear, Eagle and Komodo Dragon all in one to make a very noble, intimidating, proud but elegantly beautiful Godzilla. This version is by far my favorite in terms of appearance. The final confrontation is very satisfying and the killing blow is done perfectly.

Cons: If you're not a Godzilla fan, the story is slow to build up and Godzilla makes appearance about as much as the shark from Jaws (This isn't a con for me). The human element is lacking and the main character is a bore. The American military present in the movie may irritate you based on moronic decisions made.

All in all, I found this movie perfect for me, and I can't stop being engrossed in it. The final confrontation being in the climax of the movie was done so well. I love every second of it.",1414368000,,1731,4.538461538461538

We pulled it back out a couple weeks later and watched again, paying closer attention this time. Now it was making sense and we got it.

I know it's a cinematic device to let the viewer's ""mind eye"" to fill in the blacks for suspensful stuff, but I seriously had no idea Godzilla died in the last fight .. until they finally show a scene with some sun light in it and it seems Godzilla just got knocked out and wakes up.. and stumbles off like he's hungover into the ocean... Wow - seriously had no idea what happened ...and that's a shame.  TOTAL BUZZ KILL.  It takes forever to get to the good stuff... and YAWN after putting up with a cliche tired over-used story line of a Husband trying to get home to the doting Wife in San Fran.. who's got the kid.. blah blah blah ..YAAAAWN... Damn it I was really wanting to love this movie.  TONY HICKS of the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS was the best quote they could print on the back of the DVD which said ""This is the Godzilla fans have been waiting for.""  No, it's not YOU IDIOT.

They focused too much on the people, the movie wasn't about the people it was about Godzilla.  And the fight scenes were filmed in such darkness that you could not see them.

I enjoyed this more than the 1995 movie with mathew Broderick as this version of Godzilla goes along with the Japanese versions of this movie. The only thing that I did not enjoy was almost all fighting scenes seemed to be shot in a dark environment and made it hard to see. I am sure that is what they were going for but it was a minor frustration when tyring to see these awesome fights when the darkness of the movie created a challenge.,1414022400,,481,4.239130434782608

However, it wasn't nearly as fun and the effects, while good, still were the darked out, can't see the beasts very well-type of effects that just didn't do it for me. Some of the newer movies have more realistic daylight effects (X-men, Elysium,  etc). This could've been better.

5953544,1,B00EXPOCXY,This complete failure deserves a number less than zero on the scale.  The first hour has about 1 minute of monster in it.  You'll be watching a soap opera when you paid to see a Godzilla movie. They did it that way because it's a lot cheaper to show sentimental people than special effects.  One of the worst disappointments is Godzilla's voice.  That snapping-turtle-faced creature has laryngitis compared to the real Godzilla of yesteryear.  There is no chilling bellow with that trademark electric aftershock you're waiting to hear.  Just a lame growl.  The movie is mostly about one man and his wife and their child and his grandfather and how the monsters interfere with their daily routine.  And as others pointed out in their comments the screen is so dark that you can't see what is happening in most of the action.  Those responsible for this mess should be fired.,1413936000,2,873,4.766666666666667
5953545,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla? Really? Where? Watch the movie, you'll know what I mean. SPOILER?

A Godzilla ""monster movie"" is supposed to be about the MONSTER. In this movie the monsters are  poorly filmed, ""CGI'd"", supporting actors, at best.

All the campy warmth, overacting, out of sync dialouge - monsters smacking model cities and airplanes around...all the FUN, GONE.

As always this loses a star for using CGI, at all. It loses another star for having the nerve to use CGI in a Godzilla film, of all places! - HERESY! All they had to do was build miniatures and film their FX properly. If you can't do it without CGI, leave it out. If you can't make the movie without CGI do it as a book. Anything can happen in a book - but a book does so honestly and without cheating.

Loses another star for misleading trailers regarding Bryan Cranston's role in the film and one last one for taking itself WAY too seriously - AGAIN it's SUPPOSED to be Godzilla.

The cheapest of old style movie effects are more honest and endearing to the viewer than the highest budget, ""best executed"" computer generated ""effects"" of today.",1413936000,2,1103,4.630769230769231

5953557,2,B00EXPOCXY,"The thing American directors need to remember is this: if you're going to make a film called ""Godzilla"", make sure it's actually about Godzilla and not about some ham-handed human spirit plot line with kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"") fights relegated to background decoration. I paid money to see Godzilla do one or both of two things: 1.) Destroy one or more major cities, and 2.) Battle it out with other kaiju. I don't care that the main protagonist really, really loves his family. That would be nice if this were supposed to be, say, a family drama of some sort. But it's not. It's supposed to be about Godzilla being...well...Godzilla. Humans serve two purposes in a kaiju film: to run and scream in every conceivable direction upon the monster's/monsters' arrival, and to put up a futile and idiotic resistance against said monsters with their insufficient weaponry. Only once American directors get the hint that no one cares about human drama in such movies will we finally be privy to Godzilla getting the magnificent screen treatment that he so sorely deserves. This movie had so much potential to be a truly awesome viewing experience, and instead the filmmakers thought we'd care more about seeing Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character sorting through his own baggage and daddy issues. Hopefully the inevitable sequel doesn't make the same mistakes.",1413849600,,1365,5.098214285714286

Godzilla is not the star monster in tis film, he only shows up at the end of the movie to kill off the star monsters. Also the monsters' screen time is 10 minutes total. The Story focuses on 2 men one who dies with in the first 20 minutes of the film and his grown up son who is a military officer. The son's actions are contradictory to his words all the time. He tells his wife ""I'm coming to get you ad our son right now!"" then he volunteers for suicide missions like planting a nuke on the monsters. The writers know nothing about how nukes work, the bomb goes off only 1 mile away from ""our hero"" and he doesn't get radiation poisoning! When Godzilla does show up he avoids attacking the ships that are trying to kill him and he avoids damaging buildings and killing people (totally out of character for the big guy) This Godzilla is the dumb hero one from the little kid's dream from the movie ""Godzilla on monster Island"". The American 90's one was at least miss under stood monster, this new Godzilla isn't even a monster; He's a giant SUPER HERO (stupid!!!).

The makers of this movie should have called it "" Two Giant Bugs"" and something that vaguely resembles Godzilla. SPOILER ALERT ! I've never seen a movie that was supposed to be about a character that is hardly ever shown in a movie. Godzilla comes out on the screen maybe 4 or 5 times and that's it. The rest of the time you may see his back spikes or a leg. 95% of the movie rolls with the giant spider bugs leading the action. The lead character (Brian Cranston) dies 15 or 20 minutes into the movie....what the heck ? The plot never seems to have any direction and aimlessly drags you around for two hours. Total Hollywood trash. I'm so glad I didn't waste $12 on this at the movie theater. Also, this movie is unusually dark. I thought there was something wrong with my tv at first. I had to try other DVD's to make sure it was ok. Two hours of my life and a $1.29 Redbox rental fee I will never get back.

It is not bad but in some of the shots it does look like it and of course the old miss use of nuclear power, and that man is not in control were the themes of the movie.

He gave a powerful performance in the first third of the film, to advance the plot lines, thus fulfilling the obligations inherent in the screenplay. Did any of you work on the movie? Were you a screenwriter? Director? Producer? No? and No? So shut the hell up and enjoy it for the great sci-fi it is. I buy movies because they are good and bear up under repeated viewing and scrutiny for models of the genre. Godzilla 2014 respected the past movies with carry-over elements and advanced the genre with new contributions.

You want to whine about something? Direct the criticism to the soap-opera masquerading as a science fiction movie that was Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds. He owes us a Part 2, where Cruise's son wanders off out of the film and pops up at the end. I am hoping we get a ""director's cut"" in the future whereby we get the HALO warrior's view and action from the son as he tries to fight the aliens, or at least bear witness to the special effects carnage that was so woefully lacking in the rest of WOTW.  Anybody who can make a landmark film like Schindler's List should have been able to make a successful homage to another landmark film known as War of the Worlds, with Gene Kelly and Ann Robinson.

THIS remake neatly avoided that and provided characters that you cheered for as they clearly said by their actions: ""Screw this, not if I have anything to say about it!"" Rather than the typical deer-in-headlights look right before they're eaten or something horrific happens right before their eyes. To sum up, there is enough action to keep you excited throughout, but thankfully they kept the gore and over the top horror to a reasonable level--it has become so popular to follow random people around in movies for the express purpose of seeing them run to their inevitable deaths, so much so that it has gotten really old and clinched, in my opinion at least.",1413676800,,860,4.778523489932886

The designs for the monsters is fantastic, this is now one of my favorite designs for Godzilla. The special features are also fun.

In the first,Roland Emmerich added some humor to the situation that were enjoyable and very much needed in this opus.  The problems lie in several areas.  The first is that the ""motos"" seem too faked--one looked like an upside bowl of oatmeal and the other one looked like a poorly designed flying mantis.  Godzilla, himself, has returned to the orignal design, but you rarely see him in his full glory.  Why?  Because the damaged cities are shown after the monster attacks.  Also, when the creatures do meet there is too dang much fog, smoke, etc--the action one wanted to see was almost hidden.  It seems that what was to be a glorious rebirth, is more of a still birth.

5953704,3,B00EXPOCXY,"It was a somewhat entertaining movie as most big budget films are today. But it seems more of a combination of superhero/action movie type of plot that is popular in movie trends today. Godzilla as superhero, not the threatening monster of the original Japanese version. Well, ships following side by side as Godzilla swims across the Pacific. What? Are you kidding me? You don't get close to Godzilla!  It kind of reminded me of the old Godzilla cartoons, and I half-expected Godzooky to make an appearance. The whole nuclear bomb stuff was like something out of the Die-Hard movies, like, ""we have to disarm this thing"" and only one guy is capable of doing it which, oh, of course, is the son of the late Mr. Brody (Cranston). The Mutos kind of looked like they were adopted from a Transformers movie, and looked almost mechanical in design rather than some type of prehistoric monsters. Godzilla, the creature, was okay in design. It's really just another movie to appeal to the big explosion, CGI filled, hyped-up type of experience that is passed off as the ""must see"" crowds of modern cinema. Sorry, but although this is passable entertainment, and I am a fan of the Japanese original, I would rather spend my time with an independently made, but less seen and well-made film.",1413590400,3,1282,4.774774774774775

None of the characters actions made any sense, which is fine 'cause it's a Godzilla movie, however Godzilla is hardly in the movie at all. I was pretty drunk when I watched this but I'm positive there was one scene where Godzilla is facing the other monster like they're about to duke it out when the scene cuts away to some other uninteresting bs and the fight is never shown! The Mutado monster or whatever it is sucked too. Just that generic unmemorable Cloverfield, Super 8, CGI, playstation 2 crap.  Pacific Rim was better.",1413590400,,570,4.533980582524272

Ok listen, if the director wants to make some deep point about the dangers of man overstepping nature etc... do it somewhere else, bub. I watch Godzilla to see some giant lizard throw down fighting monsters, wreck a city, and smash some tanks. This movie focuses more on a single soldier's exploits and some new modern cliche monsters. Godzilla is more of an after thought. If I want to watch an Opera, I will watch opera, If I want to watch giant monsters bash stuff up real good, I watch Godzilla.

5953717,2,B00EXPOCXY,"A giant prehistoric lizard coming to the surface for the first time in modern society should be a pretty easy straight forward tale to tell, especially since it's been done so many times in the past with the exact same same giant lizard.  This version however is overly complicated, I don't think even the actors, director and anyone else making this even knew what was going on by the end. You've got a nuclear missile on a train that gets eaten by one of the transformer preymantis things then later it's still around as they continue on with the got to get the missle to the ocean storyline.  We'll just destroy stuff, no one will notice this doesn't make sense anymore, they must have thought.

The acting wasn't necessarily bad, it was just the script was terrible.  The best script occurred at the start of the film decades ago in Japan but once we got to the present, the writers just didn't know what to do.  You've got a Japanese couple who loose their kid so the hero (or son of hero really as the main selling point of who was in it was killed off early in the film), the couple finally reunite with the kid and don't even come over and thank the hero for keeping their son safe, they just walk off.  Then you've got son of hero's wife who is obviously fairly intelligent as she's some sort of ER nurse or something like that, yet she needs to stay behind when everyone else boards buses and leaves just so that her husband can come rescue her.  Maybe this was a homage to the 50's or something when Godzilla hit the scene and a woman at the time was sort of seen as helpless without a man to help her survive, but it just looked ridiculous in a modern set city.",1413504000,,1673,4.308917197452229

The Thing in 1964), but why they turned the character over to an unqualified idiot like Gareth Williams is beyond me.  He clearly does not know the character or his audience.  This film is so dark that you rarely know what's going on.  I have no idea what happened with the train carrying the missiles at the bridge; I could only see darkness.  And again, the entire climax of the movie is in total darkness.  All of the characters are two dimensional cardboard and I didn't  care if they lived or died.  The story itself is trying to be so many things at the same time that it's impossible to know what it really wants to be.  And Godzilla has so little screen time you don't know if he's the hero, the bad guy or just a tourist passing through.  This is crap of world class magnitude.

The monster effects were excellent, and the monsters are the main characters in many ways. Yeah, yeah, there were human characters, too, and there was stuff going on with them that was all very well. There was a whole Taoist/Green philosophical thing going on, as in the best of the other films in the franchise. In that way, this Godzilla is a worthy successor of the original movie. I think it might even go further than the original to grab us dense Americans by the head and rub our noses in the fact that the world is much bigger than us.",1413244800,,671,4.463414634146342

Otherwise, while watching this horror, and at the 1:09 mark, I hit display on my DVD player thinking this boring POS had to be nearing the end. Right? Please!

Imagine my horror upon learning that there was still another hour left? Really? ACK!

Monster-wise Godzilla = Cool ... Very Cool actually but he's barely ever seen in a movie named GODZILLA!!!!!!!

And the Monsters he's fighting?? = completely ridiculous looking and the film makers didn't even consistently use their
powers for what you would think they were there for. WTF???

This move just went on and on and I didn't even care anymore after that 1:09 mark mentioned earlier. Yawnaroo!!!!

Sorry but I'm 54, so I literally grew up on Godzilla...and Gamera...and Mothra...ETC.....

So I worshiped every minute ever shown of Godzilla demolishing every one of those crappy fake Tokyo sets he ever came anywhere near.

So to me as a huge fan this was NOT Godzilla. I hate to say it but I l even loved Godzilla '98 more compared to this version of his long odyssey. Sigh...

For me the film took to long to get good and really show the monsters and Godzilla. We were 30 minutes into the film and we still hadn't seen a monster. When the real action hit it was spoiled in that it was all at night with massive clouds of dust and smoke and you could barely see the monsters at times. I can understand that some things will occur at night but why the entire fight scene. With today's excellent CGI this movie would have been better if you could see what was going on.

This ain't it nor was the 1998 version, but there was something about that one, he didn't look at all like Godzilla (giant t-rex anyone?) But it had action! Which was sorely lacking in this one, after the first 30mins. Into this movie I could tell it was made for the newcomers which is not a bad thing, I have read reviews that said it was great, fantastic, excellent yet I can use none of those words to describe this movie, I found it to be slow and boring, forget the actors I won't even go into that but this is Godzilla and WE NEED TO SEE HIM!! And I didn't not enough! The muto's were a joke rehashed monsters (cloverfield anyone?) The lighting was bad in the ONE battle that mattered and waaaaay too much time trying to develope the story, the Godzilla of old has none of this and is about pure knock-down-beat up the other monsters destruction (we didn't even get a chance to see him use his fists!!) As for me I will stick with the Godzilla of old because the Godzilla's of new just ain't cutting it and it's sad for me a true GODZILLA fan!

5953868,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I apologize to Matthew Broderick's version of the Godzilla franchise. Compared to this smoldering pile of Godzilla manure that movie was Citizen Kane. At least with the Matthew Broderick version there was a story to follow and you got to see Godzilla every once in a while. There was a 'narrative' which you could trace and bless it's heart it had some enthusiasm and heart.

This version very much lacked a story or a narrative or a sense of what it wanted to be. It reminded me of the original US English version which sort of clunked the Raymond Burr narrative onto a very original movie. This movie was not original but they did  splice the Bryan Cranston nonsense on the front of it. Sort of a homage to the Raymond Burr version I guess.

There was no real antagonist to follow. The glorious reveal of Godzilla never happened.  Really it is a bunch of random scenes you've seen done better in countless movies, various characters wander around with no explanation and at no time do you feel any suspense or desire to see what might happen next. A random 'Hiroshima' watch that supposedly belonged to Ken Watanabe's father which would have made the character 70 years old. Just a complete waste of CGI. Avoid this movie at all costs especially if you like any of the actors that might allegedly be in the movie. Save yourself. Save your time and save your money.",1413072000,8,1366,4.586065573770492

5953882,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla is an amazing film! Everyone seems not to like it. I can see probably why, they expected an all out kaiju battle like pacific rim or the later godzilla films. What they got is a film that had drama and build up. The major complaint is the lack of godzilla, me being a fan of godzilla the first time I saw it I was on that side too, the second time I understood why. To get to know the human characters, like the 1954 original which also doesn't really have godzilla in it is about the human characters and their reactions to the events that are displayed in the film. Godzilla had little screen time in that also, but his presense was know and felt by every human character. This film catches the thing that godzilla really is a force of nature, in the 1954 film he attacked Japan as a metaphor for the bomb and to stop making these weapons that have an everlasting effect. In this film a certain shift in the balance of nature is shifted and Godzilla returns to restore that balance. Another complaint I hate is why not have the Godzilla theme in this film! This is a new Godzilla and the film composer does an amazing job with this soundtrack using stock music from akira ikifube would only take you out of the film, it is a classic theme but this is an American interpretation of Godzilla and the music pays homage to Ikifube's score while being its own. I appalled Gareth Edwards and the cast for this film. It is a great of cinema and can't wait for the sequel in 2018! Long live the King!",1413072000,,1503,4.295774647887324

The only reason I gave it two stars was because they at least portrayed Godzilla well; his roaring scream was a great throwback to the older movies, and he even had the same look.

The filmmakers made the decision to employ the Jaws strategy of making us wait before we finally see the killer shark. They seem also to have taken to heart the Hitchcock philosophy that the scariest things are the ones you don't see. I don't think this works in a Godzilla movie. The reason for this, I think, is that Godzilla is not a horror element; he is a spectacle and a figure of awe. We don't need a build up to terror, because this isn't terror. I did enjoy that they made Godzilla so enormous. If there is ever a Godzilla vs. King Kong movie, I don't think Kong will stand a chance.",1412985600,3,680,4.159090909090909

5953915,4,B00EXPOCXY,"The 1998 version of ""Godzilla"" is lambasted to this day because it took too many liberties with the classic behemoth, but if you disregard these changes it's a great giant-creature-attacks-city flick. It was just serious enough, but with an amusing edge. combine that with an interesting cast, a great-looking monster and hundreds of little ones and you have a fabulously entertaining colossal-creature feature.

The problem with the original Godzilla is that he's actually cute. Yes, he's 300-feet high, but he's cute. And that's the case in this 2014 version as well, but that's okay because he's on our side, I think.

The plot revolves around Godzilla taking on a couple of like-size monsters called MUTOs (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms"") and the destruction of one city after another in Japan, Hawaii and mainland America. While these fights don't occur until the second half of the movie, the CGI is great, as is the all-around filmmaking. There's nothing wrong on this front.

It's the human characters and their story where the film is mediocre. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the main protagonist, Elizabeth Olsen his wife, and Bryan Cranston his father. Also on hand are Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Richard T. Jones and Sally Hawkins. These actors are all perfectly competent, but the story-as-written never makes 'em click as interesting characters. As such, they're bland. And, since the first half of the movie is focused on the build-up to the monsters, it's more boring than compelling.

Still, it is Godzilla and there are some memorable disaster-oriented moments.

The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Honolulu, British Columbia and Nevada.

5953936,4,B00EXPOCXY,"This film was not perfect, but after such a huge letdown with the previous attempt, I think I was ready to be pleased with a movie that did the key things right.  I think this Godzilla is pretty spot on, as far as the look and actions go...  I was glad to see this one fit the shape and motion of the classics, and to breathe his atomic breath in a legitimate way...
I dug the whole idea of where he came from and of how the ecosystem worked for him and his kind, and of the reasons the monsters were drawn to cities because of it...
I thought it was a bit annoying, tho not completely unexpected for the movie to toy with his big reveal for ages and ages, catching glimpses and shaky views, I felt like the movie makers were willingly teasing the audience, and after a bit, it got tiresome...
Mostly, my dislike of this version stemmed from the other 'monsters' used for this film...  with a multitude of other, established beasts to draw upon, the mutos just seemed like a cheap knock off...  It was odd to see a film completely pull through with the classic look of Godzilla himself and then take a complete left turn on the counter-monsters...
I expected to see another excellent remake of a classic to battle, but the new monsters just seemed mindless, piecemeal, and foreign.
Add to that the beginning scenes that were over far too quickly replacing actors set high on the list of characters with unknowns that lacked a certain feel and contact with the audience...  The eventual main human character had almost no realistic reactions to events (I know he's a soldier, but that just seemed an excuse to be emotionally blank) and his own family, specifically his kid, seemed like a mindless extra whom you never really felt much for...
Nevertheless, I think getting Godzilla himself right factors in to get this film a much higher rating than it would have garnered without his performance...

I won't go deep into specifics (since that is exactly what I was doing) but Godzilla comes in and the kick ass fight begins.  True there are moments that I wondered if Godzilla would prevail, but he did and in a great way.

A good example is they knew where the monsters are headed yet they don't evacuated until right before they arrive. The amount of minor detail they skipped over just kept stacking up like this until it destroyed the story.

Many of the scenes felt unfinished or cut off such as battle scenes would start up then like someone hit a skip button the battle would be over or unfinished making the viewer lost to what happened.

I think for the sequel planned for 2018 they need to pay closer attention to these details and maybe just maybe they can make a great movie instead of an okay movie.",1412726400,2,866,4.440251572327044

 Gian-ormous Godzilla gobbles up the gate.  Godzilla 2014 is already a smashing, mashing stomping success.  On Thursday night in a special early showing it snagged a substantial $9 million across the nation.  The big guy drew in the crowds over the rest of the weekend to score the second highest opening of the year with a domestic take of $93.2 million.  This puts Godzilla just a roar behind Captain America which brought in a domestic total of $95 million earlier this year.  Adding up the domestic and the overseas box office for the weekend we come up with a stupendous $196 million.  Godzilla is already on track to a very profitable run with its reported budget of $160 million.  This weeks movie is making money and loads of fans are hurrying into the dark to see it.  But should you?
 Are you nuts?  This is Godzilla!  Even a so so Godzilla movie is fun to watch if only to see one of the worlds premier cities stomped to rubble.  This Godzilla is far from so so.  It is a magnificent example of what the industry is capable of when Hollywood wants to make a big disaster movie.  The last US made film in the series was Godzilla of 1998 directed by Roland Emmerich.  That version, while fun for fans, did not find a mass audience and ended up costing the producers a lot of money.  This version is a much better movie.
 We don't see the monster for a long time.  Writers Max Borenstein (screenplay) and Dave Callahan-story- (Doom, both Expendables movies) did a much better job than either of their rsums would suggest.  Borenstein is a journeyman Hollywood type with credits as an actor and director as well as a writer.  He is associated with nothing that the average viewer will remember.  Story writer Callahan penned the tale for Doom-a Sci-fi flick that I enjoyed and two tongue in cheek action movies The Expendables and The Expendables 2.  How would we know that they could write this monster masterpiece?
 If we just want to see big monsters wreck stuff, we could watch Pacific Rim on DVD and not have to put on our nice clothes.  Godzilla slowly builds a sense of anticipation and gathering doom for the first half of the film.  Most of us have seen a film or three in this series.  We know that a big lizard will eventually come out of the ocean, stomp some city into junk and then die or go back to sea.  So when the movie guys can bring us this sense of overwhelming danger coming at us in the slow lane, we can applaud.
 Director Gareth Edwards has a very thin record as a director.  Not for long.  Producers like nothing as much as a director that can make them enough money to get a bigger yacht, or a bigger private island as this one is likely to do.
 We cant give the success of the film to the actors either.  Bryan Cranston is the only truly famous name attached to the film.  His success in the TV series Breaking Bad has both propelled his career and given him the latitude to throw himself into his roles.  He is manic here as the scientist and grieving husband who alone suspects the truth about an atomic incident at Japanese nuclear power plant.
 Elizabeth Olsen is delicious as the young wife of Arron Taylor-Johnson, the focus of the action.  She appeared in a number of forgettable films until her role as the Scarlet Witch in this years Captain America.  That was a tiny role in a giant movie-she appears only in the credits.  In Godzilla she gets more screen time.  She is the younger sister of the Olsen Twins.
 Her co-star Aaron Taylor-Johnson joins her in a credits only appearance in Captain America.  He did a credible job in Savages and in two of the comic book based Kick Ass movies.  He isn't asked to do much besides run around in Godzilla which he does handily.
 Also appearing are long time character actor David Strathairn and Japanese character actor Ken Watanabe.
 There are a few plot stupidities in Godzilla but they do not ruin things for the watcher.  The careful pacing of the film makes the day and we like the players enough to care if they go down Godzillas gullet or not.  The three and a half saw blade disaster/monster movie carries a tame PG-13 rating.  It runs for a solid two hours and three minutes.  This re-run of a familiar theme well rewarded my time.  I think you will like it too.",1412726400,,4266,4.455368693402328

5954020,1,B00EXPOCXY,"FILM CRITIQUE ONLY

The idea behind every film - even documentaries - is to entertain. A film which pushes it's most interesting characters to the background will almost certainly fail to do this, as this Godzilla reboot proves in spades. Aaron Taylor-Johnson brings nothing to the film delivering a cringe worthy performance, as does everyone else not named Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston or Julie Binoche the latter two play tragically tiny roles. Besides the incomprehensible focus on boring characters, the script is non-sense filled with characters willfully engaging in actions that directly contradict their objectives. It's almost as though the writers were out to prove that nonsensical stories can be written by someone other than Michael Bay's team. The monsters are uninspired, the battles are served in snippets that are frequently interrupted by Taylor-Johnson for no identifiable reason and Godzilla is in less than 50% of the film.

Many will defend the title by pointing to the early Toho films and while I commend their dedication to the characters heritage such a defense ignores the necessity for a film to evolve. Additionally such a defense highlights an ugly truth, most Godzilla films are terrible. These films share the same ridiculous focus on boring characters and incomprehensible plots, where they outshine the new movie is in the character of the monsters themselves and the accompanying battles. New Godzilla has been reduced to a bio-weapon meant to serve US interest, while his predecessor was a metaphor for humanities apathy towards nature and lust for destruction.

All in all I can't recommend anyone actually pay money to own this film, rent it if you must but people who love quality films should steer clear of this and hope for a superior sequel.",1412640000,,1785,5.16955017301038

5954032,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I did not read any reviews towards the film before buying and was not aware that some people disliked it till I saw it posted on here: (Amazon or online). I tend to glance at opinions on Amazon instead of professional reviews so I was surprised about some negative feedback. I will not give away any spoilers, just my opinion.

The movie is well done, but Godzilla feels like a 2ndary character in his own film. This, to me, I felt was the main flaw in the film. Yes, you see him battle monsters and makes himself known various times as well as the ending battle. The director however felt the need to inject human drama by mashing a family oriented love story to the film. He also added a typical scenario: ""man worried about his family in the middle of chaos"". I normally do not mind these, but felt it could have had less screen time and more attention to Godzilla and other MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) battling it out. It felt the movie was a build up to the ending battle with minor fights and appearances before the end.

Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Brody) did play a good role in the film, but felt that he needed to be a 2ndary character and not Godzilla. After all, the film is named Godzilla. When I see monster films, I expect the monster to stand out above everyone else. Especially with todays special effects. Instead, the beginning was focused on his dad and mother then jumps to Brodys family. In a film like Godzilla which he is well know and people want to see more of him there should be less human drama. If it was a generic monster other than Godzilla focusing on the humans might have worked better.

On a positive note, I was surprised it was 3 monsters and not just Godzilla destroying everything around him with humans trying to fend him off. I am a big fan of monster films like Aliens, Pacific Rim or in general most sci-fi oriented plots. The major drive for me is sound and visuals (story also) but the reason I buy with the intentions of the sound being well done is due to my high end sound system. (I tend to watch films with friends and like to impress)... Sound is good and Godzilla certainly makes himself known. Explosions, gun fights, missiles, planes, even Godzilla roars and atomic breath were well done.

Visually the night scenes could have had some more detail, sometimes its was midnight with no moonlight.... Example: forest scenes. Even when they were in the city it felt to dark, no it was not my black level on my plasma since I tend to watch a lot of scary films that revolve around night scenes. Godzillas night scenes stood out to me as more darker. Day scenes had great detail to them and look well (as well as a daylight monster battle).

To put it simple, yes its worth owning and I have seen the film twice since I purchased it and have no regrets. The film is not bad, I just felt Godzilla needed to be more of the focus instead of the humans. If you have seen Pacific Rim, the tone is basically: monster battles one after another and a massive battle at the end. In Godzilla, the tone feels like a build up to the end battle with occasional minor appearances at the start and middle of the film. Everything else before that was everyone trying to figuring out how to stop them with a generic ""I have to survive for my family"" theme.",1412553600,2,3304,4.41871921182266

Many of the most pivotal scenes, (and probably most exciting scenes based on the music and sounds) are so dark, I'm saying DARK like BLACK with maybe just a hint of something moving. What in the world! I thought my 50"" Plasma flat screen settings had gotten messed up. So I cranked everything up to BRIGHT-BRIGHT-BRIGHT!

The normal scenes would pop the eyes right out of your head! We almost needed sun glasses to watch those parts. But STILL, the dark scenes were virtually unchanged.

It was very frustrating to watch because you know you're missing some very important stuff. It defies logic to 'Film' a movie in pitch black. But if you like Not Watching a movie, you'll probably give this one 5 stars like so many others.",1412467200,30,966,4.540229885057471

5954084,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla 2014 is a big disappointment for me.  The film is a decent movie but, in my opinion, not a good Godzilla movie and just a lackluster film in general.  There is barely any Godzilla in the film and instead focuses mostly on the human point-of-view.  That is not necessarily a bad approach except that the human characters are not that interesting.  When we see Godzilla and the other monsters wreak havoc it is awesome and there is some good action and great effects.  However, when we finally see Godzilla wreak havoc and fighting the other creatures it is short-lived until the very end.  Plus, the film is very padded out.

The film is not god-awful.  There are a lot of things that the film does very well.  The effects are amazing.  This is probably the best looking Godzilla movie so far.  The movie, especially at the end fight has a very grand and epic feel to it.  Everything just feels so huge and when the action scenes happen they are epic from the great effects, to the action, to the great set pieces.  This must be an amazing film to see in 3D.  I did not see it in 3D though.

I also really like the design of Godzilla as well as the other monsters.  Of all the films I have seen I think this one has my favorite design of Godzilla.  Fans of the original Godzilla from Japan will be happy to know that this film stays true to the original film and lore right down to Godzillas look.  A good chunk of the film also takes place in Japan.  For me personally, I do not care about that as much.

Unlike most people I was introduced to Godzilla through the 1998 film and grew up on that, so I will always like and look to that movie first.  I know I am in the minority but I enjoy the 1998 Godzilla movie.  Honestly, I even like that film more than this film.  I am not asking for anyone to agree but thats how I feel.  I like the characters more, I like the action scenes more (though they did not feel as epic), and I like that Godzilla was used much more.  The film felt a lot more like a Godzilla movie because he was in it much more and felt like a more realized character.  I actually felt for Godzilla in the 1998 film, while in this one it was hard to get invested in Godzilla because we do not see him enough.

One of the big issues I have with the film is that we barely see any Godzilla.  The most we see of him is his spikes sticking out of the water.  We do not see Godzilla in his full glory until near the end.  We see the other monsters more and even then not much.  When Godzilla or the other creatures wreck a city when he is fighting the other creatures we only see a little bit of it then it cuts away and then you see the end result until the end fight, which bugged me.  When we see the monsters wreaking havoc it looks amazing, so I wish I could have seen more of it.  When the trailers hinted that other monsters besides Godzilla would be in the film I was expecting something along the lines of Pacific Rim with lots of monster action, but that is not what we get.  I do not want to hear people say: A movie with lots of monster action is not realistic.  This is a movie that has giant monsters.  What is realistic about that?  What I like about the 1998 film is that they have fun with the monster.

The entire film is from the perspective of the humans which is not always bad but it is in this case.  The human characters are not interesting enough to keep me invested for the entire film.  The characters in the 1998 film, whether you like them or not, have more personality and are more memorable than the people in this.  The only interesting character in the film is Brian Cranstons character.  When he was there I was more invested and I thought he was going to be the lead considering he was marketed as the main character in the trailers.  However he is killed off halfway through the film and the lead role shifts to his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and there is nothing to this guy.  He is not interesting and has only one expression on his face throughout the entire film.  He just looks very bored even when everything is coming down around him.  The other characters are extremely forgettable, if you can even call them characters.  The only other somewhat decent character is Dr. Ishiro played by Ken Watanabe.  However, most of his screen time consists of him standing around not doing anything so it does not matter.

Overall, Godzilla 2014 is, sadly, a lame movie in my opinion.  It can be considered a good or even great movie to fans of the original Godzilla.  For me it was a disappointment.  There are things the film does well or even amazingly well.  I guess I was expecting a somewhat different film then what we got.  You don't have to think that way though.  I think many people will enjoy the film.  Many people who have seen it did enjoy it.",1412380800,,4816,4.237623762376238

Not that we couldn't afford it. It wasn't around yet...Old I am. I still love the genre. Love sci-fi. The Americans bought the franchise. I think they did a great job with this. Yes a lot of story, character development going on which is not a bad thing(watch transformers for opposite), the big guy may not have received much focus or personality. But it was very well done and much respect I think given to the original franchise. Anyone  that loved this as a kid, I don't care how old you are now, had to at least think ""cool"" the very first time he fired up the atomic breath in the movie. That scene alone was worth the wait for Godzilla. I just wish my son was a little older to watch this. A little more graphic on destruction and a few four letter words fly. But as an older kid, adult. It was a fun movie.

We all know by now this has nothing to do with the 1998 thing that ferris couldn't even save. I don't think that movie was all that bad. I know that's saying something negative about my taste. I never considered the 98 even a Godzilla movie. It was it's own thing.

5954112,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I've been a Gojira fan since I was a little kid (I call him by his original Japanese name). I had nightmares about him rampaging through my neighborhood, shaking the ground with his thundering steps and amazing roar. I eagerly anticipated this reboot directed by Gareth Edwards, someone who understands the ethos and meaning of nature gone amok. I left the theater very impressed; this film pays homage and connects to the original, while bringing Gojira into the world that exists today.

I found the films pacing to be just right: a slow buildup to a titanic clash between age-old enemies who have fought each other eons before humans appeared on Earth. People are in this movie are in fact mere spectators to something far beyond their control. As some critics here have shown, perhaps this plot line doesn't fit with their 'immediate explosions and UFC fighting' expectations. No mindless Transformers here.

The film does have flaws to be sure. It loses momentum for a time when Bryan Cranston's character dies, Ken Watanabe isn't given nearly enough quality screen time, and good wife Elizabeth Olsen has little to do but look concerned and fearful. Primary star Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a creditable job, but one must remember the focus of the film is not the humans--it's nature, and humanitys ignorance of its true power.

Once Gojira and the MUTOs meet in full battle mode, things really get rolling. I was very impressed by the design and background of these creatures, down to the fact that the two sexes of this species are very different from each other. Their battle has a context to it: survival. The MUTOs are protecting their offspring, and Gojira knows they exist by killing his own species. Just as lions and hyenas fight to the death, these eternal enemies evolved to kill each other.

All in all I feel this film accomplished its mission, which is to bring Gojira into the 21st century, with meaning and a message: that nature is in control, and always will be.

This is a slow-burn film that keeps Godzilla off the screen for the first half of the movie, building the anticipation. Credit to director Gareth Edwards for not taking the typical route of bombastic action set pieces and instead he has taken a page out of Spielberg's Jaws play book, only showing snippets of Godzilla, saving him for the second act. I feel this was a refreshing approach especially for this type of genre film, capturing the mystery and majesty of Godzilla.

Reading some of the other reviews - there is NO comparison to Jaws ,at all.( There was action right off the git go !)Alien on the other hand never did take off - the whole thing was dragged.( But ALIENS is a 5 star film in my reviews!)
I grew up with Godzilla, still love him, but this is one instance where foreign made is a LOT better.
The only worse one is the remake with Matthew Broderick - that has to hit the record books as the worst one ever made!
Please keep your hands off my fave monster - you only  make the guy in the rubber suit look like a 10 star model!
- And those old ones were at least fun and watchable, without all the soap opera.

When these ""giant animals"" appeared, you could not see them or the surroundings, only hear. Once in a while you might be able to make out what character it was.

5954195,3,B00EXPOCXY,Growing up with the original Godzilla movies i may have not been the ideal audience for this movie. It starts with the generic emotional front end and then spends quite a while getting the gears up to speed for some proper monster action. I think the actors took far too much of a central roll in this movie leaving Godzilla and the monsters few moments to actually do their thing. The visuals were impressive and certainly a step up from the previous american Godzilla film.,1412208000,,475,4.6

5954221,3,B00EXPOCXY,"After watching this version and the 1998 stinkeroo version I've come to the conclusion that no amount of special effects can make Godzilla any better than the campy, English-dubbed, man-in-a-rubber-suit classic Godzilla that we all love.  It's the campiness that made Godzilla a classic to begin with.  That said, this version is done pretty well, at least he looks like Godzilla and not like a mutated giant iguana.  The sound guys reworked the famous roar so that although different it's more reminiscent of the sound he made back in the 50's and 60's.  The real problems I had with this version were about the storyline.  Even though titled ""Godzilla"" most of the movie features the other monsters, referred to as ""Mutos"" and big-G doesn't even appear until halfway through the movie.  Then there was no character development to speak of, just a few segments involving a lost boy being returned to his parents and some ongoing stuff about the son of a reactor scientist who is some kind of expert needed to fight Godzilla.  If producers ever remake Godzilla again, I suggest they do some serious study about what elements made it great 50 years ago and incorporate more of them into a modern version.",1412121600,2,1203,4.839024390243902

I mean, did anyone think that prettyboy hero and his family wouldn't make it? Come on. Heisenberg had to sacrifice his old lady, so we get cheated out of what we were hoping would be a great monster on monster battle ?? If the writers wanted to make it a family victory from the ashes type drama, they should've had a hot Japanese chick standing by to rescue Heisenberg from his emotional devastation and then together they assist Godzilla in thwarting the two cheap Rodan knockoffs and then live happily ever after.

What would it take to make a Godzilla movie right?

1) donr't make humans bystandards. Pacific Rim took the spectacular idea of creating human controlled giant robots. But what about inventing an implant that we manage to insert in another monsters brain, giving us control? Or finding a protagonist with telekinetic powers? Only when he starts to use them against Godzilla he starts to be able to see godzillas thoughts and finds out the terrible things men have done to him throughout the ages.

2) make it clever. I'm not saying it needs a fight club moment but just something unexpected! What if we fight Godzilla and almost get him using some advanced tech. Then later when Godzilla is fighting another monster he lured the monster into that same tech so we can help Godzilla in the battle?

3) make it FUN
Pretty much every sci fi movie lives or dies based on whether it has a Han Solo. Someone fun but bold. Someone to keep things light. PACIFIC RIM had this with Charlie Day but he was off dealing with his own side story. Bring in Robert Downey Jr. for the next Godzilla.",1412121600,,1313,4.527426160337553

For me the problem was the writing - there is an almost complete lack of subtlety, surprise, humor, wit, complexity, or self-awareness. Everything is played dead straight. Every character is a recognizable stereotype and does what you'd expect, every time.  As in the zombie genre, in this universe nobody has ever heard of monster movies.  I can't recall a single joke or funny moment in the whole movie. But isn't one of the most wonderful human qualities that we find humor in even the bleakest circumstances?

5954330,4,B00EXPOCXY,This isn't your classic Godzilla movie.  There is a significant overtone of environmentalism throughout this movie and how humans have brought this destruction upon ourselves (e.g. the monsters) and how Godzilla keeps a balance between those forces.  Way to go Hollywood.... such a stretch to add politics into your movies.,1412121600,,323,5.44
5954331,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Foreword: This is a review of the playback quality of the video, not the movie itself so take it as a grain of salt & just skip on to the other reviews for the films contents.

As it has been my previous experience ordering a major motion picture movie through digital content has been sub par. I've had subscriptions from TV shows like SOA, Supernatural & Walking Dead in my Amazon Digital Library but this, being the second major motion picture I ordered in the streaming format has been disappointing. The TV shows are just fine I guess but for movies, I want that HD clarity in all aspects. I have to ask Amazon for a refund which always has been great in regards to their customer service, even though it's the second time I have asked them for it with the caveat of reordering it on Bluray.

The surround sound effects & video clarity is just night & day compared to Bluray. Majority of the scenes in Godzilla are in darkness or night time so having an edge lit, 60"" Sony TV only shows its shortcomings on playback of digital content even if it's on HD. For some reason too I thought that the overall quality of their digital contents were better before & even came with captions on Amazon. For reference, I'm using Logitech's Revue & a Sony BDP-S580 for digital playback. Yes, I have sufficient speed with Cox on a premium tier service with close to 100MB/sec download speed but still comes out like in a Standard Definition format. I don't know why coz I don't have any problems with my Netflix services on video & sound quality which is really great but not on Amazon. 

From here on then, Bluray it is for me when it comes to big movies until Amazon's HD contents matches Netflix quality at the very least.",1412121600,,1716,4.438095238095238

5954361,4,B00EXPOCXY,"So last year, Warner Bros. and company were successful with the movie Pacific Rim. And this year they released the remake of Godzilla.
After an incident gone terribly wrong resulting in the loss of Joe's wife Sandra, Joe is determined to figure out what exactly caused this incident to happen. Many years later, Joe and Sandra's son Ford is thrust into a tight situation; as being a military man and a dad is not always easy. But soon after meeting Dr. Ishiro, Ford and the world will come to know the creature known as Godzilla.
The good in Godzilla consists of: Godzilla himself; the design team and visual effects crew deserve  respectable mentions for the overall look of the iconic monster; everytime Godzilla is on screen, you  have to admire the stature and presence that he has. On to the actors, I was surprisingly not impressed with Aaron Taylor Johnson's nor Elizabeth Olsen's performances as Ford and Elle, although I was impressed with Ken Watanabe's performance as Dr. Ishiro and HIGHLY pleased with Bryan Cranston's performance as Joe, which is why I will SERIOUSLY be giving the series Breaking Bad a watch on Netflix in the foreseeable future.
There is some fault in this movie. Main fault being the screen time appearance of the titular character. As I previously stated, the scenes that Godzilla is in are good but he does not have enough screen time in the movie. Also, the second act of this movie can sometimes cause impatience due to the viewer getting teased by something big, but only a few times does that something big actually capitalize on that suspense.
 Fortunately however, the good that this movie does have somehow manages to outweigh the bad. A sequel has been confirmed, and my hope is that Warner Bros./ Legendary Pictures makes some major adjustments for the sequel to be better. Not a great movie, nor is it a movie you must see right away but I will rate Godzilla

7.6/10

5954365,5,B00EXPOCXY,"As I left the theaters I realized that clearly the directors and script writers knew what they were doing as opposed to the 1998 disaster. The film captures what a Godzilla movie should be, and not a 2 hour monsters punching each other fest. This was the movie i wanted to see back in 1998, I wouldn't have minded more Godzilla, but too much of him and the film would have degenerated into mediocrity. Any true Godzilla fan would love this film, and even newcomers may enjoy it as well.",1411948800,,486,4.411111111111111
5954366,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla is certainly back in this one.

First let me review the DVD/bluray. The picture and sound on this set are phenomenal. Night and day scenes are vivid.

There are numerous makings of shorts to watch as well.

Now for the movie....

Godzilla - He looks fantastic. They captured his growl, his ferocity, his blue flame of death and destructive personality.
The Mutos - These creatures looked amazing. There was a level of detail that made them feel lifelike. From their mating rituals to the egg sacks being carried by the female Muto.
Both Godzilla & the Mutos had detail like saliva, breathing hard, also these creatures displayed various emotions.
Godzilla shows a sense of relief when he slays the male Muto. The female Muto shows fear and cries when it makes the mistake of taking on Godzilla by itself.
The pacing of the movie is pretty fast. It's a 2 hr movie that feels like 90 minutes.
The acting pretty decent. The actors all came across as real. Obviously Cranston was the best because he acts his heart out in whatever he is in.
Basically many fans will find this Godzilla similar to Gamera from Gamera III. Where he was indifferent to the humans but would kill them if they got in the way of his target prey. Like Gamera, he was dead set on killing the mutant creatures.
And now to the cons......
More Godzilla!!! More Cranston!!!
They were both worth the price of admission. I also thought the score was pretty weak. There was a few parts that worked, such as the music played when the tsunami occurred and when the femuto was chasing the soldiers towards the end climax of the movie.
Other than that, it was weak score.
There were cutaways that worked and cutaways that didn't.
The cutaways that worked - The scene when Godzilla is footstomping the large muto, the camera pans down to see the reaction it is having on the humans, then the camera pans back. This worked.
The cutaway after the reveal was not a good idea. There was another bad cutaway when Elizabeth Olsen is running from the muto, then she runs from Godzilla when he appears. The bad cutaway was when they start to fight and the doors shut.
These cutaways hurt the movie.
We waited 16 years for a Godzilla movie not to have it taken from us again.
Memo to director, in the sequel, less cutaways, don't drown us in cgi, but don't tease either.
Some of the cutaways worked, some didn't.
Overall, this is a must have for any Godzilla fans and fans of giant monsters.",1411948800,8,2449,4.546485260770975

5954368,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I totally agree with the basic concept people are pointing out.  This is a throw back to classic Godzilla movies.  Knowing that I was really looking forward to it.  But I'm going to disagree with the success of how well they pulled it off.  The human story for me broke down after in the middle of the story and became hollow for some reason.  I won't say what point it changed because its a spoiler.  Lets just say the movie lost itself at the end of the scene when the first monster attacks.  The monster designs themselves were weak also.  Parts of Godzilla looked amazing and parts looked weak.  The ""Bad Guys"" for me were just a mess.",1411948800,2,639,4.3474576271186445

5954379,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw this film on an airplane and half the film was just too dark, so unfortunately I'm not sure what actually happened,.. Because there aren't a lot of English speaking lines (largely monster talk). The plot starts off really interesting but seems to weaken and then just gets wrapped up super quick at the end.

5954380,2,B00EXPOCXY,"This is a review of the 3D cinematography - not of the movie plot etc.  I have quite a bit of 3D filming experience and have loved 3D from the early 50's.  I have been disappointed with many of the new 3D films lately.  But this one, which should have been a 3D wonder, was a very limited depth production with most, if not all, the depth behind the screen window.  With so many shots that could have been spectacular if coming forward from the screen window - they just did not.
One reason is that films shot in 3D need height to include the 3D image within the frame necessary for good ""in front of the screen presentation.""  Why, oh why, are these films shot and shown in 2.40:1 aspect ratio which severely limits the 3D effect.  (Why do you think IMAX 3D is so good?  It has the necessary height in the screen format to present great 3D.)
As to the effects - well the monster bird looked like it was constructed of scrap metal - why?  Wasn't it supposed to be a living thing?  But, then again, all the action with the monster creatures was at night and filmed so darkly that much of the effects were not clearly seen and almost all of the 3D was reduced to virtually nothing.  Very poor, indeed.
I had such hopes for the 3D production.  Oh well...........",1411862400,,1259,4.270042194092827

5954394,4,B00EXPOCXY,"THE FILM:

I'm probably not the best to rate this Godzilla film, since before this one I've only watched one of the previous series: the original japanese ""Gojira"" (not the americanized version), and in that film Godzilla was an absolute villain monster, so I don't know how well this film compares to the rest of the series (in which, as in this film, Godzilla fights other monsters).  I can only review this film for how it stands alone as a film for unfamiliar people, and I say: it's pretty good, though not without flaws.

This film is basically a disaster movie.  Think ""Earthquake"", ""Volcano"" or ""Twister"".  As in every disaster film, it shows how helpless the people feel in a situation completely out of their control.  This is what this film sets out to do, and at this it succeeds wonderfully.  The other side of the coin is that in order to make us interested in the people, a disaster film needs to have interesting main characters, and at this ""Godzilla"" fails.  The best character is Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston, but his involvement in the film is really small, despite what the trailers led you to believe, and we're focused more on his son Ford, who is spectacularly bland, and scientist Ishiro Serizawa, played by Ken Watanabe, who you'd swear his only function is to stand in one spot and slowly look around astonished.

Of course, the main star is supposed to be Godzilla, and this succeeds in most parts and fails in others.  The design of the monster is great, and in a few scenes it looks uncannily like the original, albeit more realistic (as realistic a giant, fire-breathing bipedal lizard can look).  As a giant monster, his movements are slow but powerful, and his attacks are well crafted.  His iconic growl returns, and it's magnificent as usual.  The same goes for the MUTOs, the two monsters Godzilla battles.  Their designs are interesting and different, and they show power and emotion in surprising and terrifying ways.

The problem is that the decision of leaving them in the background, while it works good for building up and makes the latest action scenes stand out better, makes the humans take center stage, and as I mentioned before, they're not very interesting.  While the disaster movie approach works well for the film, it makes Godzilla feel like a tertiary character in his own film, specially since the MUTOs have more screen time than him.

But still, the film manages to be entertaining, and the last action scenes, in which we can finally see the monsters fight each other and wreak havoc, are absolutely spectacular.  Though I hope the next film gives us either more Godzilla or better characters.

THE BLU-RAY:

The video and audio quality of the Blu-Ray are fantastic.  The film looks great and very detailed in my 42"" TV, and even though it's a pretty dark film (in a literal way), the image is still very clear.  I know some people complain they can't see anything... They must be watching a bootleg version, because the real deal looks spectacular.

The Blu-Ray comes with a few special features, divided in two categories.  The first one is ""MONARCH: Declassified"", which consists of three in-universe documentary films detailing the first encounter with Godzilla, the MUTOs and the aftermath of the world learning about these creatures.  They're pretty fun and they offer more detail into the film's backstory and consequences.

The second category, ""The Legendary Godzilla"" is a series of four ""Making of"" videos, showcasing the decisions behind the movie and the filming process.  These ones are a bit dissapointing, since they don't really tell much and they're on the short side.  There's a bit about the new Godzilla design and the ideas for the MUTOs, but there's practically nothing about the old Godzilla films and how this new one compares, no mention of the previous american Godzilla, even in passing, and since nowadays there are mostly two kind of SFX: green screen and CGI there's very little of interest about the filmmaking process.

Though, I have to say, it's a bit interesting to note how it's clear that in some points the rest of the filmmaking team and the cast didn't see eye to eye with the director, and they subtly hint about it.  They make sure you know that some things were the director's decision and not theirs.  It's kinda fun to notice that, actually.

A small note is that they went lazy with the Blu-Ray menu and they used the generic ""pre-made round buttons"" one that you see in many movies instead of creating their own.

THE LIMITED METALPAK EDITION:

The shiny metal case for the film is both neat and annoying.  It looks fantastic, with details embossed on the front and back.  There's a little button in the top left that, when pressed, lets out Godzilla's classic roar.  That never, EVER gets old.  The volume is not too high, so don't think of scaring your neighbors with it, but it sounds louder if you have the box open.

The problems are that the box is a bit heavier than usual (not much, but it will hurt if it falls on your feet), the glossy metal is a fingerprint magnet, it's also probably easy to scratch and the emboss is too pronunciated and not uniform, so forget about having this movie neatly arranged next to other Blu-Ray boxes.  It will always stand out.  Perhaps that was the point.",1411862400,,5311,4.735582154515778

5954428,3,B00EXPOCXY,"For us to feel a return on our investment of two hours in a movie, there has to be some character (or characters) that we care about.  And for there to be a story, the characters need to go through some kind of change. In a disaster movie, the characters are usually an ensemble of people from different walks of life whose lives are affected by the disaster and the story is about how the disaster changes them.

In this movie, there is only one focal character in the movie - Lt. Ford Brody - who experiences the first kaiju attack as a child and then seems to have the bad luck of being where the kaijus - Mothra (""mota"" in this movie) and Godzilla - pop up.  Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody, Ford's obsessed father, obsessed because he had to slam the radiation shield on his wife in the first Mota incursion at a Japanese nuclear power plant.

Characters and dialogue are essentially non-existent in this movie. In don't think a word is spoken during the last thirty minutes. Instead the soundtrack was filled with epic music while the monsters slow-danced each other around San Francisco and tiny humans scurried around doing heroic things so that we would have someone to root for.

I don't have anything against monster fights, but the fights were either in the dark or in the fog, presumably to save on the CGI budget. Also, these monsters seemed strangely ""clunky.""  We've seen better in Cloverfield and Pacific Rim, so we - or me - may be spoiled.

Also, it seemed stipulated that Godzilla was the ""good guy,"" if only because Ken Watanabe's Dr. Serizawa said he was, and the remaining population of San Francisco cheered when he revived and crushed a hundred cars (we assume) on his way out of San Francisco, accompanied by the swelling heroic music.

Monsters - Three cities, several cruisers, numerous helicopters, a couple of nuclear bombs, a train, an entire bomb disposal team, and Brian Cranston.

5954449,1,B00EXPOCXY,"In the Korean movie ""The Host"" the monster is used as a plot device to highlight the quirky offbeat family relationship of our main characters and the way they come together in the crisis.  It was an excellent movie and an excellent use of the device.  It should not have been used in ""Godzilla"".  To state plainly and clearly: GODZILLA SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN USED AS A PLOT DEVICE IN HIS OWN MOVIE! to highlight weak ancillary characters.  It was also demeaning and insulting  to use the show a little here, show a little there ""Jaws"" technique thoughout the entire film.  Maybe in the beginning, but after the first 15-20 minutes no more.  Godzilla should have been allowed to shine much sooner and much more.  The final ""climatic"" battle is weak at best and is so dark in color and details that it was hard to differentiate details.  I love Godzilla and have been a fan since I was a small child born in 1956.  I regret ever having purchased this film and i gave it away.

5954450,2,B00EXPOCXY,"this remake (how many so far?) of the honored franchise is first and foremost a digital hollywood monster epic. there are dozens of visually impressive, expertly designed and edited computer animation action sequences, and the influence on visual design of the comix esthetic is on full display. CGI has become so refined that it can imitate the visual texture of different media -- broadcast television, grainy archival film, HD video, live action -- and this is exploited as well. we get plenty of the four great textures of epic animation -- churning water, vast explosions, collapsing masonry and billowing dust. of course, the major monster battles take place at night, the major monster sounds include terrific thumping, clumping and crunching, with blatting cries created on a tuba. everything culminates in, what else, a race against time and a boss battle of the beasts.

the plot, assuming you stop to reflect on it, reveals how much the modern digital hollywood monster epic resembles a fast food franchise. the menu is basic and stereotyped, the ingredients all artificial, the manufacturing cost low, the nutritional value zero. even the business model is obvious: the marquee stars are either killed off early in the film (binoche, cranston) or are limited to grim but ornamental cameos (watanabe, strathairn). this works because the actors commit to a single week of shooting, the marketers can use their names and images, and the producers can budget them with a back share of the gate. the real dramatic work is left to less recognizable, lower paid actors -- the predictably hunky aaron taylor-johnson and a surprisingly effective elizabeth olsen as his abandoned wife. even they don't do much work -- anguish and determination are the keynotes of their characters, as he's a soldier, she's a nurse, and duty separates them until the last scenes.

i understand science literacy is at a pathetic, risible ebb in the 21st century united states of consumerism, so i won't quibble that, for example, an apex predator has a r selection reproductive strategy and a stark sexual dimorphism (male soars, female crawls). but we're asked to believe that catalysis can cause radioactivity, or that radioactivity qualifies as ""food"", or that radioactivity in japan can be detected by an organism in the philippines, or that a winged organism can lift a nuclear submarine many times its mass from a submerged location, then can generate enough EMP to fry shielded military networks and aircraft guidance systems. but why pick on the science stupidity, when the plot has many other stupidities on the menu? how about a security team that must go through the front entrance of a nuclear waste depository before they discover a gaping mountainside hole in the back, or a vast open air research complex kept secret in an age of satellite imagery, or a train carrying nuclear weapons to san francisco that is routed over a high bridge, at night, without aerial escort, exactly where the monster is located? i still haven't figured out how the hero and lost child get out of that smashed tram car, or how the soldier is reunited with his son. it seems blatant stupidity and silly plot holes are essential ingredients in the fast food formula.

some of that is just comix culture shaping the plot to the maximum number of high volume, high impact CGI episodes. but the rest of it is nonsense that should make any high school student smirk or burst out laughing. unlike ""pacific rim"", which handled similar lapses with an ironic or knowing wink at the implausibility (and had clearly superior computer animation), in ""godzilla"" we have a film that actually relies on the complacent stupidity of its audience in order to succeed. and why not? -- it's a fast food monster epic. and in fast food monster epic cinema, the point is that you gulp it down to relieve your boredom, and don't stop to think about what you're actually eating.",1411689600,,3929,4.95

5954455,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Being a Godzilla fan growing up I found this movie to be somewhat disappointing.  This was ultimately a family drama set against a monster invasion.  You could easily substitute ""monster"" for natural disaster, international terrorism, zombie outbreak or even Bob Saget's Career.

The ultimate theme of the movie are Sins of the Father revisiting the son... with monsters.  A father's obsession with finding the truth about the disaster that claimed his wife's life leads his estranged son to become involved and nearly lose his own son.

Military intervention, in typical Hollywood fashion, ignores expert scientific device in order to take a heavy-handed approach to fight the monsters and ultimately fails, leaving salvation to the titular monster.  The Military Recklessly and routinely engage monsters with Civilians in the line of fire, while making almost no effort to move them to safety.  Special Forces and otherwise expert military operators are reduced to cliche and poorly used fodder for the monsters to step on or eat.  Again, they ultimately fail their mission.

That being said, the monsters get precious little screen time and the few fight scenes usually cut to a background of being seen on TV news while the story character go about their daily lives.  This does a huge disservice to the viewer who wants to see Godzilla pummel the crap out of a monster, not be reduced to a plot device to further the poorly written story.

What is left is amusing in that its almost a Godzilla Movie.  The monsters are well-designed and look great on the screen - certainly better than the old Japanese monster suits.  The Military presence is almost laughable at how poorly executed their battle plan is.  And the Family drama becomes almost overbearing.

If you are a Godzilla fan, this would get a D-, its saving grace being some of the artistic shots, special effects, and the limited monster screen time.  Many of the older Godzilla flicks are available on Prime, so I would suggest them before this movie.",1411689600,5,2016,4.973134328358209

What is with the EMP waves? One minute everything is fried and the next everything is working again? Apparently they don't know what EMP does to electronics.

The biggest let down is the so called ending. They give us the lame excuse that they don't have time to open the case to the bomb because it is stuck. BUT they have time to drag the war head by foot from the city to the shore, put it on a boat, fend off an attack and still get it far enough away that it doesn't devastate everything. By the way if you can see the blast you are too close and they saw the blast. What about the tsunami that followed?

Why make it appear that Godzilla is dead and then miraculously have him stand up and walk off? What was the point?

I would say that this is such a lame version of Godzilla that the American motion picture industry had a hand in it, like the horrible version they made several years ago.

5954470,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I have to admit that I was tempted to give this a five star rating, but held back a little for a couple reasons which I'll spell out below, but let me say that if you are a fan of Godzilla, you will LOVE this movie!! I grew up watching Godzilla movies on my local Creature Feature, and have always been a big fan of the rampaging lizard. In the past few years I had introduced my daughter to Godzilla, and she too became enamored with the King of All Monsters. We had been following the progress of this film since Legendary first announced it was going into production, and went to see it twice on opening weekend, and third time about a week later. and we both admit that it really delivered what we were looking for.

""Godzilla"" opens Ishiro Serizawa, a Japanese scientist is investigating a mine collapse in the Philippines. Inside the mine, they find the skeletal remains of huge animal, and two spore pods. One is still intact, but one has burst open, and is now empty. At a nuclear power plant in Japan, we meet an American family, the Brody's. Joe and his wife Sandra work at the reactor, and their son Ford goes to a local nearby school. While Sandra takes a team to inspect the reactor, something strikes the nuclear power plant causing a leak. As the plant goes into emergency shut-down, Sandra and her team are killed. Joe wants to know what caused the accident and he doesn't believe the cover story of an earthquake. Flash forward 15 years, and Ford is now in the military, still trying to come to terms with what happened to his mother, and trying to hold onto a relationship with his father. When Joe is arrested near the grounds of the destroyed nuclear power plant, Ford travels to Japan to bail him out. While there, the Brody's discover that the earthquake storyline is a fake, and that something else caused the plants destruction. Now, this same thing may destroy mankind unless it can be stopped.

Fantastic special effects, Easter Eggs for longtime fans, a fantastic score...in short this is a Godzilla movie made by a Godzilla fan for Godzilla fans. I've heard the complaints about the big lizard's screen time, and I guess those are mainly coming from people who aren't familiar with the Godzilla series? This movie follows the same pattern as quite a few earlier films, ""Godzilla vs. King Kong"", ""Son of Godzilla"", ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"". Godzilla, usually has less screen time than the threat he's facing, whether that is another monster or mankind.

I think the only thing I had a real issue with, and this may be a spoiler, is the fate of Joe Brody. Bryan Cranston is such a good actor, and you root for Joe Brody in this movie. When Cranston's Brody character isn't onscreen, the human characters we are supposed to care for fall flat. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford just comes across as dull or flat. I wish that we were given characters we could be more invested in as the story plays out, but this is a minor issue, as let's face it, the one thing we are here to see is Godzilla, and some great monster fights and monster destruction.

Not a fully realised story, mostly one can do everything guy(he is a bomb disposal expert, and can HALO skydive?), and a Japanese Scientist muttering things on the sideline. Some huhs?...There is a bird eye view shot of Gozilla swimming on the surface, and an aircraft carrier tailing him by a distance of two hundred yards...yea right! A shot of twenty navy ships, gathered in a tiny space in front of the Golden Gate. Looks like a bathub full of toy ships. The Golden Gate is crowded with people fleeing the city, G-zilla on the way...but hey, let's blockade all the traffic and strand them on the bridge. Which forces the heroic school bus driver to step on the gas to get off the bridge. They don't even show a shot of the bus actually getting off the bridge. The nurse wife of the hero guy is shown cowering, but no actual sequence of her escaping sure death by her wiles and pluck, just cowering. The two ""bad guy"" monsters are pretty clunky looking. Godzilla is not featured or well written enough to form some kind of personality. We are supposed to see him as a good guy, cause he goes after the bad monsters. The old King Kong film from 1933 was more astute in this, creating a fearsome but ultimately sympathetic character.

Acting: meh (especially after being teased in the promos with Bryan Cranston only to have him last a short time in the actual movie.) CGI: good. Godzilla: way cool, but WAY too little of him (never mind the ridiculous comparison to Jaws!)

If you bought the DVD you will be mightily surprised at how poorly it is lighted. Yes, I have an excellent (Samsung) LED TV. If I hadn't seen the movie in the theater I would have had little-to-no idea what was going on during the G/MUTO battles. I completely missed the swat with the tail, and the final blow-by-breath only showed up as glowing heads. I had my doubts when others complained about the poor lighting but sadly I have to agree.

Don't get me wrong, I'll watch it when I get the hankering for a Godzilla home-showing. I'll still mumble under my breath though when scenes are sacrificed to the dark.

I'm hoping the sequel will be (much) better all the way around. But Mothra? C'mon!

FOLLOW-UP: Now I know for sure it's the DVD that's dark. I smart-TVd a TubeYou compilation video of all whopping 7+ minutes of Godzilla in the movie.

Of course you don't know this until the end of the movie. This is a slow motion and somewhat uneventful movie during the first hour.  The build up of the movie is laboring; lots of dialogue, long periods between snapshot special effect action scenes.  The character development weak and acting was fair/poor.  With the exception of the father (played by Bryan Cranston) who has a short lived role, he was far more convincing than the scientist Dr. Serizawa, (played by Ken Watanabe).  I was particularly annoyed with Watanabe's role.  His character, supposedly a credible, tenured scientist, was clueless, shocked and baffled throughout the whole movie.  Watanabe's role left me disappointed he didn't have a more substantive role because I think he's a great actor.  The1998 version of Godzilla didn't portray the scientist (played by Matthew Broderick) as stagnant; at least he weaved some workable intelligence and solutions in the 1998 Godzilla movie; I had hoped more for Watanabe.  I'm a Godzilla fan, however this movie lacked the buildup of anticipation and excitement I had hoped to get from a Godzilla movie.",1411603200,2,1269,5.023923444976076

5954506,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Director Gareth Edwards reboots the Godzilla franchise with a vengeance.  This film is to Godzilla what The Dark Knight was to Batman and Skyfall was to James Bond.  It brings together a powerful visual style, dramatic story elements and human interest story very well acted by the cast (most notably Bryan Cranston).  People are divided on this film, those who don't like it say that there's not enough of Godzilla and too much happens in the dark.  It's true and if you want to see a summer popcorn movie with two hours of Godzilla stomping around cities this is not the movie for you.  If you want to see something that incorporates elements of good dramatic filmmaking with a powerful, Hitchcockian visual style that transcends the usual sic-fi ""giant monster"" popcorn film then this is the film to see.

The movie also detracts on a 'hero' but does tie everything together at the end.  Overall the movie moves along and never feels slow.  However could it have been done better? Sure. Could I have done 100 pushups instead of 99? Yea, if I gave it a little more effort. - that's all this movie needed to score higher in my book.  I think for a Godzilla movie it scores really high!

Some of the original Godzilla movies were just plain ridiculous and the 90's version was an abomination. Were people expecting Oscar winning performances and writing from a monster movie or maybe CGI that would make their brains explode with amazement?
I was completely satisfied with every aspect of this movie. The storyline is good, they created a more believable origin for Godzilla and the MUTOS. The story is not without its flaws, of course, but what monster movie is perfect and 100% believable? It is fiction after all. The acting is good and the special effects are spectacular. I was worried that they might ignore Godzilla's atomic breath as they did in the 90's version, but they came through. My advice is to watch this movie!",1411516800,,877,4.738562091503268

You can't really see the action that well. There are some nice shots of Godzilla and some exciting scenes. However, there just weren't enough great shots of Godzilla leveling buildings and cities etc. I agree with other people that the human drama and stories really aren't necessary and just seem too cheesy and sentimental, when the audience wants to see Godzilla stamping the city, leveling things, and breathing fire. The bits and pieces of emotional sentimentality just slow down the movie. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is really quite good, he is very believable and likable, although his emotional sub plot would have been better to simply be converted over to straight up action scenes. Action movies like this leave me feeling too empty and brainless, but as far as action movies go, this one did a pretty good job at accomplishing what it set out to do.",1411516800,,995,4.858823529411764

There were too many friggin' people in a dang Giant Monster Movie.

There were not any good fight scenes between the monsters, most of them show up as news footage on the televisions the people are watching.
Honestly who cares if the little boy grew up to be a bomb disposal dude?  Not that his profession did him any good except to get him on the the fast track to get from Japan the the States.  He could not open the cover to disarm the bomb when that would have been useful.  And who tells their wife to wait with their child for them to come pick them up when GIANT MONSTERS are headed in their direction?  The Matthew Broderick Godzilla was better than this one.
Do yourself a favor and re-watch Cloverfield if all you want are glimpses of the monsters.  And re-watch Pacific Rim if you want cool fight scenes.

Despite these flaws, I really enjoyed the film! I am telling you the truth! The acting was not the best (the lead actor was talentless and Watanabe was underutilized). I really did appreciate the buildup to Godzilla's showdown with these insect/bat type creatures. Good effects and expert establishment of mood.

See my review below:
OK.....about GodZilla.....I saw it on IMAX in 3D. It was a pretty good 3D. I don't know if it was worth18 bucks a ticket. The word was that IMAX was the way to see the movie and I agree.

What I liked: Godzilla !! Great version of the monster. The scene when he is first revealed in all is glory is undercut by the over-aggressive marketing that show that moment over and over again. What should have been wondrous was now something we already saw. The Fiat commercial showing the monster kinda dulled the moment, too. However, having said all that, once the monster-on-monster smack-down starts in earnest in the last part of the movie, it was a real Godzilla movie. Godzilla is literally shown to be a smart tactician at one point and just a brutal ""I've had enough of you"" ticked off battering ram who finally pulls his best trick out of the bag in a cool ""eat flaming death"" moment!! In order to stay somewhat within the style of TOHO Studios, the monsters move like they do in a Japanese monster movie instead of like say the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. The last few minutes of the film save the entire movie.

What I didn't like: It is almost the same thing I disliked about the Sony Godzilla from 1998. It is the human characters. These are more sympathetic and serious that the simpletons from Godzilla 1998. The dialogue and story are miles ahead of the execrable human characters, storyline and script of the previous movie. If you are going to give the audience a character they think is the center of the movie in the commercials, but he is not; then, I suggest having a better character ready to take his place rather than a bland, expressionless bore. The way they under-use and misuse the hottest Austin sister is just criminal. I hope they do better with her in The Avengers 2

Overall, the ""little-boy"" me was very satisfied. I saw the Godzilla my imagination saw when I watched the old Japanese monster movies. The ""grown-up"" me wanted more. This is the first of the big blockbuster movies that uses the indie/small-screen director to give us a good story plan that didn't work as the studio envisioned. Marvel still does it better.",1411430400,3,2372,4.548009367681499

It's NOT Hamlet and what I call a ""popcorn movie"" or (old Disney here) a ""E"" ticket ride.  It's fun, fast paced and don't think too deeply about it.  Escapist and well produced its a special effects laden yarn.  At times I found some of the scenes literally too dark but all in all its just a fun movie that will pull you along on a fun escapist ride.  Is it great? No.  It's not perfect but its about an atomically energized monster who lives in the depths of the ocean and maintains balance when a pair of rival monsters decide its mating time.

My review is more on the technical quality (or lack there of) of the film transfer onto a blu-ray disc.

I have a full HD tv with a 7.1 master audio sound system. My house is like a high tech theater. And I know my way around home theater systems and troubleshooting of them. Let me just say first off, what I'm about to say is not the cause of my home theater, but rather the problem with the quality of the disc transfer.

I take off a star for motion blur. I'm not talking about the pixelated motion blur that can happen to a tv with a high refresh rate. I'm talking about the motion blur that happens when a film is not transferred properly. When the camera makes a sweeping view, the objects or people on the screen will appear to be ""double"" and trail along the screen behind the original entity. That is the result of lack of attention to detail on the part of the company that does the film-to-disc transfer. Even more so, there was no effort in creativity with the main or pop-up menus, they are just run of the mill icons that you can select. The only theming to Godzilla on the menu is the stationary background photo and ominous music score.

I take of a second star for another visual aspect on the part of the transfer specialists. There appear to be a series of light and dark spots within the dark contrasts on the screen. If there is a nighttime sequence, there appears to be weird blotches of brighter blacks and super dark blacks. I thought this was my tv but I realized my tv is edge lit, and is incapable of creating this particular pattern. And when I tried another movie, the contrasts and screen colors were perfect. So just as a warning, the transfer appears almost professionally boot-legged. -if there was such a thing.

If you are a person that does not notice visual subtleties, then the movie is fine, it is in full HD and 7.1 audio, and the audio is great. But if you are like me and you treasure precision quality on your home theater screen, you may see blurry ""doubles"" and dusty white blotches during dark sequences (not the result of visual editing to make a focused object stand out, this is purely an un-intentional mistake). Other than that, great sound quality, awesome special features and great story telling!",1411344000,2,2524,4.466377440347071

I and no doubt millions also loved this film despite the hate. Yes all common movie criticisms are understandable but saying this was terrible as a Godzilla film in general is just dumb.

The most common and most debated criticism was the lack of Goji. Sorry but those arguments are invalid. Both Godzillas in 2014 and 1954 appeared very little and that was the point.  To build suspense and mystery to the big pay off.
Expect the slower pacing. This isn't a dumb mindless action film. This is something much more.

DON'T WORRY, the sequels will undoubtedly have double the Goji and destruction so that should fix those dumb ""i wanted nonstop dumb action like Transformers and Pacific rimm not dis crap"". Idiots...

But in my opinion it was also the hype that hurt the film abit aswell.  NEVER OVERHYPE any thing. You can be disappointed no matter the quality.

In all, this film was so amazing I actually bought it on Blu-ray and that's saying something. Because this is actually the first live action DVD/Blu-ray I've bought in years since I don't like purchasing live action movies.

I had high expectations for this film given the hype and suggestiveness of the direction the production team was going to take.

I liked the movie but it lacked - sorely.

I thought, first, the film should have been longer given the out-sized subject matter - period.
With better character development, some originality ( oh my God - there were several scenes that harkened back to and mirrored the 1998 Godzilla!!!) and deeper dread, this would have rocked.

I was expecting a 'real world' approach - and it was there - to a limited extent - but the film fell back into traditional WWF style, side-line commentating ('What's the current location of blah, blah, blah ...') from cursory actors and feel good moments when this should have been a horror movie of the epical kind.

Close but not quite.

Watched it twice.
Might watch it again.
Sometimes makes a difference.
But I believe the potential, here, was greater than the final realization.

I will look forward to the follow up films and pray they do not get silly, pander or pull punches.",1411344000,2,1116,4.721649484536083

It generally hits most of the buttons for what you would expect in a Godzilla movie.
That said, the some key scenes take place at night.  I appreciate that acting that goes in to the film, but let's be frank. This is a monster movie and I want to see some giant lizards crushing buildings.  Not shadows and weird sound effects, which is what I got.

However, that is exactly what it lacks. The screen time allotted for the monsters is woefully poor, forcing the watcher to wallow in the unnecessary trail of humanity's loss and the completely redundant ""reluctant hero"" story-line.
Give me more of Watanabe trying to tell everyone that the monster isn't a monster at all and is really their answer to the tragedy. At least Godzilla himself is shown in excellent, CGI-perfected glory with some unique and impressive shots in-water.

5954703,1,B00EXPOCXY,"i LOVE gojira.  and that's why this movie made me so sad.  i could never hate goji.  ever.  his first movie came the year i was born.  i have every movie, toys and more toys, comics, even plushies.  but let's be reasonable.  a godzilla movie should be about friggin' GODZILLA.  not MUTOs, not some guy who is the only one who can diffuse a bomb or his wife or anything else.

while i agree with commentors who say goji's head and teeth are too small, he's still as cute as ever.  there just wasn't enough of him.  one commentor timed his appearances on screen and it was around 7 friggin' minutes out of the over two hour movie.  WTF?

the CGI shots are much darker than most of the movie, so you can't really see much detail.  that smacks of laziness and, perhaps, lameness.  when CGI scenes have short, jumpy cuts of 2 or 3 seconds in them, using the excuse of changing angles as being arty or whatever, all i can think is that the CGIers are trying to cover up lameness 'cuz if you can't have the images in prolonged shots, you can't focus on anything long enough to see whatever mistakes the CGIers (i refuse to call them artists, since they're not) have made or how lazy they've been.

horrible acting.  story was regular...oh no, monsters!  gotta kill 'em.  nothing could be new about that.

my husband was mad at me before watching 'cuz i kept saying it was going to be lame, but when it was done, he was just as disappointed (NOT dissapointed) and disgusted as i was.  how the H-E-double hockey sticks hard can it be to put CGI monster fights in a monster movie?

i got one gut reaction:  when goji wakes up at the end and everyone cheers, i cracked up.  totally unexpected.  but i'm seriously glad i did not go to a theatre with stupid people and their stupid, obnoxious kids and waste my good money on this turd.  really disappointing the japanese have given up on their national monster and allowed us amerikans to get ahold of him and ruin it.",1411344000,,1955,4.346260387811634

I personally loved it, as a long time Godzilla fan, I grew up watching all the old movies dubbed over in English. I recall in 98 when the first American Godzilla movie came out, even as a teen I was disgusted how it wasn't anything like Godzilla, besides the name, the 98 movie is a good monster flick, just not a Godzilla movie, call it something different and it is an enjoyable popcorn flick. Read a lot of hate about the 2014 movie over the months since it's release, it was supposed to be a serious ""as serious as you can get"" take on Godzilla. I fully enjoyed this movie, and recommend it to everyone, look it has it's flaws, what movie don't, and no it's not a boom boom explosion here explosion there movie as you'd get from a Michael Bay Transformers movie, but it takes it's time to develop a story, and keep some mystery around this new updated version of Godzilla that pays homage to the Japan. Yes, Godzilla isn't in the movie a whole lot, yes Godzilla is sort of like an anti-hero in a way, but if your an Japanese Godzilla fan, this was how a lot of their movies were. Granted if you step back and look, Godzilla in this movie really doesn't pay a lot of attention to people, in fact probably killed his fair share of them, maybe not on purpose but for sure because that what his presence brings. There are 2 sequels planned for this movie, trust me I see the series going into more of the boom boom explosion explosion before it is over, and I'm sure Godzilla's appearances will double as well, the mystery is over, the origin so to speak is out of the way, so give it a try, and appreciate the movie for what it's trying to accomplish, I think if you do that and some research you will see that they came pretty close to that, and bigger better things are coming for the sequel if it still doesn't meet your expectations!",1411344000,,1916,4.2809917355371905

And once again, the best science fiction is based somewhat in reality.  Traveling from San Fran. to Tokyo at the blink of an eye doesn't just happen.  You can't just clear a city in a day. Planes don't drop vertically out of sky and in a relative small area.  Of course we put aside reality for a giant lizard and ""moth"" - but not that no one is shown killed or even hurt when an entire city is being destroyed.  And to top it off - FEMA is there on the spot within 12-24 hours of the ""disaster"" and already knows who is where - give me a break.  I'll believe a giant reptile is attacking before I believe FEMA or any government agency is there in under 72 hours.  It had the potential to show a twist on the cover up.  It had the potential to show the drama of a family torn apart by tragedy.  It had the potential to show fighting through adversity.  But you end up not caring because the other blatant lapses of reality block your sense of wonder.  I went from ""that's cool"" to ""that's just stupid"" real quick.

5954759,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Is it weird that I got so involved in this movie that I literally talked to Godzilla? Don't answer that. I'll just say that as a sci-fi/action movie this was absolutely fun. I actually didn't know the plot other that what the trailers had shown so I'll keep details out of this review. I knew Godzilla showed up, cities get laid to waste, and at some point there was going to be a pretty epic shot of a H.A.L.O. jump. From the first ten minutes of this film they lay out a backstory, so to speak, that gives you a human connection to a potentially inhuman plot. I mean how do you connect to a giant dino-lizard? The filmmakers managed to make a plot that got me involved without seeming hokey or impossible, kept me entertained with plenty of action in the vein of explosions and gunfire, plus moved the film along with a sense of urgency that kept me centered in the plot. Overall a fun film that was with the rental and perhaps a purchase. Is it Oscar worthy and thought provokingly deep? Not quite...but it's snack worthy and at least one bowl of popcorn deep. And in the end I really loved Godzilla, cheered him on style loved him. Talked to the screen loved him. He's my new friend.",1411344000,,1187,4.351351351351352

5954775,5,B00EXPOCXY,"As I scroll through the one star reviews I see a very heavy consistency, it seems people wanted Matthew Broderick back. Because what people who give these halfhearted weakly composed essays all seem to say is they want more lizard action and less talking. The utter nature of why so many movies are being rebooted is because Hollywood producers are realizing they had no clue what they were doing in the last 20 years and now understand that they need to put some thought into the script to make a movie worth seeing. They are seeing that simply having lots of explosions doesnt make an action movie good. This movie has a good back story, and good motive for why out of nowhere this huge lizard surfaces after millions of years. If you want mindless nonsense go buy the one with p diddy on the soundtrack as that more than likely will suffice but this one has a good plot and backstory to keep anyone with half a brain interested in what happens next. So the main point to walk away with is this version was an actual movie, not a fictional documentary on a huge reptile who likes to destroy stuff. What matters more is up to you.",1411257600,,1131,4.416267942583732
5954776,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I waited to watch this movie at home, and because of problems with my DISH service, I ended up watching the HD version through Amazon. I openly admit that this is definitely a movie to see on the big screen, and streaming it through a router is not the best choice; but I had to adjust and enjoy. This newest version of Godzilla had me hooked from the opening credits. This movie is treated more like reality or documentary; and almost succeeds perfectly. The music is superb, invigorating, exciting and scary. The storyline, although long and a little confusing, is good. The subplot that ties it all together is satisfying. I watched parts of it again; and I would probably buy the disc if I had a better TV. The storyline is so interesting that I will simplify it here, so there are SPOILER ALERTS: There are giant monsters in the Earth. Although they look a little bit like big dinosaurs, they are probably not the same type of organic life we are used to. Some of them eat radiation and emit EMP pulses. Some of them shoot an electric blue dragon's breath of unknown effect. They probably do not have normal life spans or eat meat or poop like we do.. When humans developed the atomic bomb in the 40's, we awoke some of these monsters who were attracted to the radiation; we tried to destroy them with atomic bombs. In Japan 15 years ago, the builders of an atomic energy plant again disturbed some of these monsters buried deep in the Earth. A baby crawled out into the sea to grow. Now, 15 years later, the same atomic plant in Japan is trying to figure out what type of thing they have been studying. The thing suddenly comes to life or calls something out of the Earth. This thing looks like an apelike giant hard-shelled insect; that screams with a hideous insect-like electronic rattle. The thing destroys the plant and flies away, later to destroy an atomic submarine to eat the radioactive core. The thing emits some type of mating call which is answered. All of this complicated storyline is told successfully against the subplot of a father who lost his wife, and now the son who is about to lose his father, and then the son has to re-unite with his wife and son. This subplot is well handled and satisfying, and not too, too unbelievable. Apparently, whenever these giant radiation eating monsters emerge to mate and lay eggs, another monster we call Godzilla also emerges to fight and kill them, restoring the balance of the Earth. This sounds horribly hoky when stated, but as told in the context of the film it is believable. The visualization of Godzilla emerging and then fighting the monsters is filmed and presented as if it were real; meaning that it looks gigantic, hazy, dark, misty... almost super-real. The actual fight scenes aren't too great, mostly Godzilla pushing and biting the monsters, stomping on one of them, and finally swatting the smaller one with his tail. The movie presents Godzilla as a God; so far above us mortal humans that he doesn't really notice us, until we shoot at him and hurt him. Even then Godzilla tries to avoid us and not to hurt us. There are some interesting scenes woven through this action. The monsters have laid eggs around a nuclear missile. While they are fighting Godzilla, the soldiers steal the missile and destroy the eggs. The monsters are killing Godzilla at this point, but when they are distracted by the egg destruction; Godzilla has a chance to recover. After killing the smaller monster, Godzilla takes a moment to stare at the human soldier, almost as if to acknowledge his assistance. Then, when the monster is about to destroy the last soldier and retrieve the bomb, Godzilla attacks and they have their final fight. This finale is really satisfying; Godzilla grabs the monster's jaws, force them apart, and breathes his blue dragon's breath down it's throat, severing it's head. Godzilla then holds the head, Kong-like, while he screams out his triumph. Godzilla then collapses in exhaustion, and later wakes up and lumbers away. There is a lot of amazing destruction, beautiful set design, and phenomenal monster choreography in this movie.",1411257600,,4125,4.730555555555555

Having grown up with Godzilla as a child back in the early 80s qualifies me to speak about this movie.  This movie is filled with deep emotion and a great storyline. There are many battles and fight sequence between the military and all monsters. This movie is gripping, stunning, bloody and gory. There are NO dry or boring, dragging areas in this movie, it literally has you on edge through the entire movie. This movie is filled with a (roller-coaster) ride of action, combat and fighting. The acting by all actors is solid, and this movie is A-list. Excellent wardrobes, period era sets and props, good make-up. All of the hard work that went into producing this movie is well appreciated. Impressive!
The Facts:
1. This movie is (damn) good hands down! I don't care about all the negative (bull) on here about this movie from most people who either where born in 1995 or later,  or  never even seen ""Son of Godzilla"". You don't have a clue. Your opinions are unfounded.
2. This movie is well made and written, and has stunning special effects and CGI.
3. The sound quality and picture will blow your mind.
4. The lighting in this movie is VERY good! You CAN see Godzilla perfectly well at Night, Evening, and during the day. If you can't, well maybe you need to get rid of your cheap TV with poor (light to dark) contrast.
5. The only flaw that I could see in this movie, that really made me very angry, and I sure hope the producers are reading this so they will get it right in the sequel...you ready, here it comes...those funny looking (elephant-like) feet! What the hell! Really guys!! Stop play'n and put those feet back to (old school) Godzilla style. It just makes sense. No animal with feet like that can swim deep in the ocean. Get it scientifically right guys, and add webbing between the toes. His feet should be (T-rex or Alligator-ish) Otherwise, Godzilla is straight-up perfect this installment!
My (hats-off) to all the producers. You guys almost brought me to tears with this move. I'm so proud of what you did. Please put those feet back and then you've got a home run design. Love the new Godzilla hardcore look. I'm just in Awe. Give us a hardcore sequel, take your time, put the next movie together right.

Thanks to all, this movie is a classic keeper, buy on Blu-ray.",1411257600,,2444,4.547727272727273

This is what happens Hollywood decides to go an finagle something up.  (Wasn't the last Godzilla movie---the one with that Puff Daddy song---a giant FAIL?!?)

Here's the thing: If you're like me and you enjoy the acting talents of Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO WATCH! Seriously.  Neither actor is given justifiable screen time for those who are fans to possibly appreciate this film.  BUT...at least they got paid!

5954787,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I was so looking forward to this new reboot of, what was to me, a beloved breakthrough science fiction tale of its time.

Unfortunately, it turned out to add up to considerably less than its parts.

The original Toho production of this epic creature, back in 1954, was new and unique. It focused on what could be called the ""force of nature"" school of terror, that is it dealt with threats that reduced all of mankind's efforts to counter them meaningless. As an audience we are just supposed to be awed and helpless. This is what the original Godzilla did so brilliantly. (If anyone hasn't seen it, I would encourage it.)

Alas, all too soon, the overwhelming impact the original story had spawned dozens of sequels, with additional giant monsters being added to battle ""our hero"" (Godzilla) for control of whatever pseudo-scientific gobbledygook it was this time. And suddenly the character of the stories changed. They were no longer a stunning peek into the overwhelming, they became more like the latest bout on some Worldwide Wrestling Federation spectacular. They became camp and, worse, self-parody. ""Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster""? Really?

So when we finally had the CGI capability to do justice to the imagination of this wonderful character, I was looking forward to it.

The first effort was the 1998 reimagining that starred (don't ask me why) Matthew Broderick. And, naturally, director Roland Emmerich decided to give it his special ""something for everybody"" touch. So there were the obligatory jokey dialogues, the loveable off-beat comic relief characters, and a confusing and rather pointless plot.

They even gave the great lizard a makeover, turning him into the world's largest salamander. And female.

So when I noticed that this latest reboot had gone back to the iconic monster, the gigantic, malevolent T-Rex form, I was hopeful they would capture what had made that very first vision so affecting.

No such luck.

Because it looks like they simple couldn't make up their minds whether they wanted to make it terrifying or a fun romp with the giant monsters.

On the one hand they treated it as so horribly SERIOUS. The long, slow, emotion drenched build up... the creepy hints of something approaching... And they hit every expected note guaranteed to jerk the old heartstrings, right down to the hero having to shepherd the lost child through mortal danger.

I was with it for the first 30 minutes, more or less, though I did have to overlook the absolute nonsense of the story. I was all set for the ""big reveal', which happened at the thirty minute mark. At last, we were going to get to see the monster. And the whole tension building was beautifully handled. All the right notes and rhythms.

And then, at just the right instant, the gigantic monster rises up into view.... and it's not Godzilla!

Huh?

I knew at that moment that they had chosen to completely dilute and toss away the entire reason for making it so deadly serious in the first place: the chance for the audience to be awed, stunned, overwhelmed by the power and majesty of Godzilla.

Only it wasn't him. It was some big insect thing.

Huh?

It totally took the wind out of the sails of the title monster. By the time he lumbered onto the screen almost a half hour later, the response was more ""well finally,"" than ""oh my God.""

So it is basically a SERIOUS imagining of the whole universe of massive threats, scotch taped onto just another goofy mid-'60's giant rubber monster suit movie with a really slick facelift.

Now there's nothing at all wrong with the effects or the action. It's all fine. Better than fine. The choice of viewing the monsters only from the point of view of a human observer helped reinforce the ""this is actually happening"" feel that has been exploited to greater or lesser effect in scores of other giant monster films over the past few decades.

But that's pretty much all it winds up being. A bunch of set piece battles mixed up with a silly, nonsense story and sometimes overwrought, overly dramatic scenes that didn't really seem to matter much.

And it just struck me what it's like.

A rice cake.

5954789,5,B00EXPOCXY,"A HUGE Godzilla fan since 1963 - I saw the film 9x in the theaters as I really dug this film. This is the kind of film I was hoping for in '98. I love the revamped design of  the Big-G and the MUTO's are awesome. I thought the plot was quite good and the acting was just fine. I had no problems with the supposed ""plot-holes"", or ""lack"" of monster action. I've got every G film on DVD or Blu-Ray and this one is a welcome addition to the collection.
  I've seen some online posts regarding the DVD / BluRay transfer. Some have claimed that the picture isn't as clean and sharp as it should be. Also some claims that the film is darker than it was in the theaters. I haven't watched the DVD and Blu-Ray enough to really ascertain if either of these issues are true or not. I did experience difficulty during daytime viewing of the DVD but I made some adjustments to my TV and all was good. The Blu-Ray disc did not pose the same sort of problem. But I did find myself wondering as to whether I should even have to change my settings. My only real complaint to this point is in the extras. What is there is great but we could have gotten more such as the deleted scene featuring a cameo by veteran Godzilla actor Akira Takarada (G54 and many others). I've heard some rumors that there may be another version released containing this sort of stuff, but until then I'm very happy with the version I've got.",1411257600,,1402,4.223880597014926

The director takes the less-is-more approach most of the time in showing Godzilla and the monster adversaries, but there is plenty of spectacle and a tremendous sense of scale in many of the scenes.  This plus the decent character development for the humans in the storyline are what make this a superior remake to anything else done in the last several decades.

The action parts of the film are not as tense as an action movie because that's not what this is.  It's about the monsters and humans-vs-nature, and the film captures this quite well.

What happened to the mighty Godzilla of old, who's roar struck fear in the hearts of  men? When he stomped and chomped his way through the neighborhoods, the ground trembled under his feet. The original 50's monster was ANGRY as hell and wanted to destroy every village and kill everyone in Japan. Brute force and fire were his weapons of mass destruction. He could demolish any arsenal opposing his power. Nothing could stop him. Well, almost. Now this Godzilla tiptoes through Tokyo and doesn't want to disturb anyone unless a building happens to get in his way while he pursues a pair of giant bat/bug like creatures. Come on!!!  I'd rather see Godzilla challenging Rodan or Mothra. Not so with  this overgrown lizard. He has now become our friend, defending all humanity. Please!!! This is the worst of all the Godzilla movies.

1. Lots of people standing around and talking, talking, and more talking.  This breaks the #1 rule of fiction writing which is ""Show, don't tell!""

2. The main protagonist does absolutely nothing in the movie except to scurry from location to location, so that the camera has an excuse to follow the (limited) monster action.

3. Lots of things in the movie don't make sense.  Like when the school buses are stuck on the bridge and about to get hit by Godzilla... because of a police blockade.  Why don't the police simply let the school buses pass?  Lots of things are simply not explained.

4. Stiff character motivations.  Bryan Cranston becomes a loon because his wife is killed.  But she only speaks a couple sentences in the movie, so you don't really identify with his obsessiveness, because you never really get to care about her.

5954801,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw Godzilla in the theater and when it came out on DVD I decided to buy it so I could watch it again. I didn't dislike the movie the first time I saw it. I think I needed time to digest what I saw. When I watched it at home the second time, it hit me: Gareth Edwards has reshaped the Godzilla franchise into the thinking person's monster movie.

I'm not going to go into the acting or the plot. I enjoyed both. I'm a long time Godzilla fan, right from the first one, with Raymond Burr. I don't get the hate for this movie. I will say this: the people who complain about Godzilla's supposed lack of screen time are missing a couple of points: first off, he was on screen from the beginning. We just didn't get a clear look at him. That was part of the build up to the big reveal. Secondly, the more CGI, the higher the budget. Yeah, I would have preferred a nonstop CGI-fest, with Godzilla in every frame, but the higher the budget, the more likely that Godzilla would not have been profitable. It obviously was, because now they're planning a sequel, with Big G going up against possibly Mothra and Rodan. You can't please everyone. Some purists wanted a man in a suit. Get real. That might have been cheaper, but that also would have looked clunky and clumsy, and I would be willing to bet that suit would have to be dressed up with--you guessed it--CGI effects. Audiences would have laughed the Godzilla reboot out of the theaters. After that Sony disaster with Matthew Broderick the King of Monsters needed his dignity and his majesty back, and Gareth Edwards and company delivered. The movie's premise is simple: Godzilla hunts and fights the two huge MUTOs. Humans are caught in the crossfire.

Godzilla in this movie is the CGI version of the 'man in a suit', yet I've seen folks online complain that he's too fat! Either that or his feet look funny. That's ridiculous. People will complain about everything.

The second disc contains 7 special features: three video (declassified) reports on the Monarch project and Godzilla, and 4 behind the scene featurettes on Godzilla, the MUTOs, and the special effects team. They're all just as enjoyable as the movie.

If you're looking for a rousing good time, Godzilla is the one. Don't believe the hate. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1411257600,,2291,4.553398058252427

My advice is to read the 1-star reviews instead, they are actually much more interesting.  No really, many of the 1-star reviews are infinitely better written than Godzilla 2014.  If you can find a five-year old to read the reviews, then the writing AND the acting will be better (not to mention the action, which of course I will not mention, given that there was no action).

Apparently all of the budget went into the trailer.  Aha, play the trailer while the five-year old child reads the 1-star reviews and you might have some real entertainment.  The next Godzilla movie should take place in Hollywood, where the 1954 Godzilla attacks the director, producers, and actors in all the Godzilla movies since 1956.

Yes, you can see they had a couple of good ideas in the concept stage, but by the time they were done they'd made an appalling mess. I mean, you're at least supposed to be able to *see* all the zillions of dollars of CGI, right? Most of this movie is almost pitch black. I'm not kidding. It was the darkest, murkiest movie I've ever not-seen. You get one clear sighting of Godzilla -- in the *very final scene*. Maybe they all thought a Godzilla movie with no Godzilla in it was somehow clever. It's not. The ""screenplay,"" if you can call it that, is equally murky, an inept and often impossible-to-follow confusion of elements cut and pasted from previous movies, right down to using 2001 music, with characters you never get to know, despite the boring, supposedly character-developing quiet scenes. The two most interesting characters (and actors) are killed off early, leaving the also-rans to run the rest of this long, slow film. Really, the whole thing is as complete and utter a failure as, say, Prometheus. Which at least was visible. Beware. All the five-star raves are either from people on some drugs I'd like to get my hands on, or people paid to give raves. There's just no other excuse.",1411257600,20,1464,4.700389105058366

5954826,1,B00EXPOCXY,"bad bad bad..................when i watch a Godzilla, KIng  Kong , Cloverfield movie i want to be entertained and have fun watching it.
this Godzilla was just plain terrible, what a joke, i am gonna  tear this  piece of crap apart, hey i wasted $3.99 watching just
the monster parts and maybe the first half hour and i am gonna get my money's worth by telling how much i  hated this boring,
stupid GRAY movie. i got so tired of seeing the characters raise up their heads looking  in fear and anticipation to see the monsters
and then it fall flat. i knew it was gonna be bad when i saw  Brian Cranston and his son go back to their house and i just knew it
the son is gonna see the HAPPY  BIRTHDAY sign just still hanging there (ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)-  Brian Cranston came  across as
a paranoid, psychotic, nut! oh  this was so bad and so predictable. all i saw was gray and Godzilla looked like a big fat
glob of  gray mass with no shape or form. best part of the movie when Rodan flies past the building before the big fight (zzzzzzzzzz)
and i could see that in the movie trailer. i understand when i watch these movies about  a giant octopus (it came from beneath
 the sea) i am to just not care about why or where these monsters came from i just  want to have fun and fell like a kid again
and just be in awe of the monsters and the destruction they cause. in Godzilla i felt nothing! just  a bunch of gray monsters falling
on top of  buildings. i felt like all the scenes with the actors were just there reaction as the director told them now look to the
right and look scared, the whole movie  looked like actor's just  watching the movie and making faces.  I was  more involved
with  Cloverfield and actually felt like i was in the movie, Cloverfield was  fun, exciting, and a good time to watch, The little
known actor's in Cloverfield were great and i  actually cared for them and wanted to see them  survive. Cloverfield was just
a good ride! the action in Cloverfield with all the yellow explosions looked great, real, and the special effects made the movie
exciting. Godzilla was gray, and dull as gray is. i hated that annoying son of Brian  Cranston and his stupid wife  her son to  turn
the TV off whole the monster's were fighting (zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz) all she did was make stupid, blank faces  and how sweet
when the little boy was reunited with his parents when el stupid son was filling out the papers to find his parents, yeah right
in all that confusion and chaos the people told  him just fill out these  papers and we can try and find them and them........
right before my eyes he finds his parents (ugh)- Cannot believe the hype, advertising, and money spent on something this bad.
All i saw was  a bunch of boring,  meaningless actor's look like  they not  know where they were--TALK about phoning it in.
i didn't even watch the fight sequences because it was all gray and blowing up and tearing buildings just to blow them up
I hated this movie. i cannot even think of the  review i would have written if i watched the whole thing. i was warned it  was
boring. now i can at least say i watched what little i did. We don't need to hear all that  mumbo jargon about why this
happened,  i wanted to see action, and have  fun watching this. but i didn't even care to watch the monster  scenes. The whole  movie
was a bunch of alot  of  monster's showing up and doing nothing!  if anyone is offended by this review don't look for me to

I have no desire to be a professional (or even amateur!) critic or film reviewer (we prefer ""user"" or viewers' reviews over ""professional"" critics). As much as we respect and admire Ken Watanabe as an actor and person, this movie was not about the acting, or script for that matter.

This is strictly another tribute (or should've been) to one of the grand-daddies of sci-fi monster flicks, Ishiro Honda's Gojira (or, more accurately, ""gorira kujira."" I.e. it's an old-fashioned monster movie, with the only difference being the use of CGI.

The reason for the 1-star rating.was strictly based on production quality. Briefly, what could've been a great series of Special FX scenes were wasted on resorting to the amateurish, low-budget tactics of staging the scenes at night, in the dark, most likely to disguise any possible imperfections in the monsters' (Muto, Gojira) imagery.

However, thanks to the last 15 minutes of the production, and some VERY fleeting moments during the movie, we were able to catch a clear glimpse of at least the infamous Godzilla. Other than that, we found ourselves attempting to discern what actually was happening during the scenes with the monsters for almost the entire 2 hours.

I promised a short review so, to summarize, what a real shame. A potentially great tribute to one of the most iconic sci-fi monsters of all time and it seemed the producers were attempting to cut costs while trying to make a blockbuster movie, resorting to poor production techniques.",1411171200,2,1532,4.996078431372549

5954869,4,B00EXPOCXY,"After the original 1956 (Japanese) film, this is the best Godzilla movie I have seen, and I think I've seen em' all.
This film is much more mature and serious then Roland Emmerich's big budget stinker, it's a much better film in general.
I like the idea of not showing the big ""G"" until later, when tension and anticipation peaks.
Tension is created by showing us the after effects of where Godzilla has been, and the story keeps pretty much focused,
without veering off into useless subplots and back stories about the family lives of the characters.

Lots of fans complain that the main star, Mr. G, doesn't get enough screen time, and all the action takes place at night.
I think director Gareth Edwards did the right thing, there is such a thing as over doing it, esp. when dealing with a giant,
impossible and unbelievable monster. Showing too much would take away the suspense and mystery. Some things are
more effective when not shown, and we have to use our imagination.

Except at the end, all the major action with the monsters happen at night. I think that adds to the suspense and creepiness.

But because much of this film is dark, it's best viewed via Blu Ray on a large screen.
If your TV is well calibrated, you can see the monsters just fine. Doesn't matter if you have LCD, LED, plasma or projection,
it needs to be calibrated to adjust for contrast and black levels, or else you won't see the monsters in the dark background.

Unlike Emmerich's terrible film, this Godzilla movie stands up well to multiple viewings. I have seen it 3 times, and get something
new each time.
In case you are wondering about a sequel, it has been officially announced, Godzilla 2 is indeed coming, but you will have
to wait until 2018!!",1411171200,,1736,4.572347266881029

5954901,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla (2014) Got the spirit of Godzilla right.  The special effects were excellent and were used sparingly.  The part that the humans played in the drama had an effect but ultimately the point that Godzilla disregards humans and does what he does for himself is spot on.  It didn't matter if humans considered him a savior, a protector, an enemy or a friend.  If you get in his way at the wrong time, you're dead.  Godzilla embodies the power of nature.  Director Edwards, through the use of televison news and limited human visual perspective, captures the relative inability of humans to impact the events going on around them.  It's like a child straining his neck to see the events of a Thanksgiving day parade in a crowd.  Sometimes we don't get to see all the action. The humans are marginalized in an effective and disturbing way.  It takes bravery in this era of CGI to let events develop in an action movie.

Either Amazon didn't stream the movie correctly or the movie was not truly HD mode. Moving on--When the movie first started I thought it was only about Godzilla. Then I saw there were two smaller beasts besides Godzilla. It only added to the confusion of the movie. The action of the movie was pretty predictable. Whenever a monster was near a building or a bridge you knew the  beasts would wreak havoc. So nothing new. Also the movie ran  SLOW and at times was boring. This movie is the the type they would show on the scify  channel on TV. And you know how bad the scify  channel is. So my highest rating for this movie would be a C-,1411084800,,787,4.333333333333333

The bluray menu and felt pretty lazy though (godzilla 2000 dvd menu had 2x the more effort). While the special features where satisfying at best. As for film well... 10 years after Final Wars (and 16 after the american iguana movie) Hollywood tries once more to bring the King of the monsters back after Japan gave the big G a well deserved retirement. Unlike Emmerich's lousy iguana who ran around like a dumb lost dog this Godzilla returns as the monster we all know and love. The problem with the movie lies on the boring human story. The human drama is somewhat foolish, generic and takes far too long as in any of the classic showa godzilla films minus the original Japanese film of course. The monster action foreplay was actually great since it got my attention whenever i saw the big G, exciting and suspenseful action seems to be lacking in today's blockbuster films as every protagonist is now a Jason Bourne and has lifeless action. Of course the problem with the monster foreplay is that left godzilla with a screentime of about 11-12 minutes in a 2 hour long movie. C'mon gareth! But final 30 minutes are well worth the with the breath taking halo jump and kaiju rumble scenes. I rate the film a 7.2/10 .

Godzilla fighting at 1:45 takes out smaller monster for 5 seconds.  Don't know how, too dark to see
Godzilla sneaks up on bigger monster, grabs it by the neck and breaths down its throat taking it out and then passes out at 1:49 for 1 minute

Question:  Godzilla is after the other monsters and never attacked the humans right?  So why did the military feel the need to get involved and basically in the way?  Oh, now I remember.

He is only on screen for roughly 11+ minutes. The true story is everything surrounding him. Also the MUTO's were cool as hell.

5954940,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Not as good as the Matthew Broderick Godzilla. I seem to be the only one who actually enjoyed the Roland Emmerich version. I liked that version and have rewatched it several times on cable. This version is long, dark and pretentious. The Emmerich version is light and light hearted. The Emmerich version is different also in that it is in a sense a true reboot. It tells the origins and first encounters with this new Godzilla while this new version is more like a sequel film.

The first Godzilla excited me greatly I saw the previews at our neighborhood theater. I was eleven. The actual movie was less impressive. Raymond Burr who was a prominent TV actor at the time was spliced into the all Japanese footage. It was well done for the day but still quite noticeable. The monster of course was a man in a rubber suit who walked around a miniature set smashing stuff.

The Japanese cranked out new rubber suit Godzilla films every year or so for the next half century - but I never bought another ticket. I did catch snippets of Godzilla movies on TV from time to time. Originally Godzilla was an unstoppable monster bent on the destruction of all mankind - especially the Japanese. But gradually Godzilla became the friend of mankind in the many sequels. Godzilla was always fighting some other giant monster and the building and artifacts of humans were smashed as an afterthought. That's why this new version reminds me of a sequel not a reboot. This Godzilla is created by CGI effects but in fact is shaped like a man in a rubber suit. This Godzilla is not shaped like any kind of a therapod dinosaur but rater like a man struggling to carry a big rubber suit. And this Godzilla immediately fights some odd giant monsters like Mothra. The film makers expect everyone in the audience to immediately recognize the set-up. This is a later-day Godzilla who appears to protect mankind not to destroy cities.

This Godzilla is some kind of emissary from Gaia who appears periodically to set things right.  The tallest dinosaur was probably a Mamenchisaurus - a sauropod with a very long neck. It was maybe 40 feet tall. We are expected to believe in some creature 400 feet tall. OK, I can do that but when you give this big monster an ethical role in the great scheme of things - my credulity revolts.

Another thing I disliked about this film is how dark it is. Godzilla and the other creatures only seem to attack at night. This of course helps with the CGI effects. Computer animation blends with models and live action footage better at low light levels. But it also detracts from the impact.  The darkness on the monster fights however does fit with the darkness of the story. The Roland Emmerich version was filled with light hearted humans some of whom were funny. But in this version everyone is always grim. Cranston is a real actor but he doesn't last long. The story after his death focuses on an unknown actor who plays his son. We don't care.

Matthew Broderick plays mostly semi-comic roles. Having him at the center of the plot signals to the audience that everything is going to be light hearted and slightly whimsical. Casting the male lead with an stolid unknown signals something entirely different. It seems to say - 'Don't bother watching this guy, this movie is not about people'.

Roland Emmerich made his career by destroying New York City on the screen. New York is blown up in 'Independence Day', it gets frozen in 'The Day After Tomorrow'. So it's not surprising that his Godzilla swims half way around the planet so it can torment the good people of Manhattan. So it's a bit refreshing that to see this new Godzilla attack San Francisco. I live way up in the Oakland hills. The San Francisco I see from my front yard looks just like the movie poster - without the big lizard of course.  I would have appreciated a few more local references.  No cable cars, no Chinatown, no hippies - it might as well have been Tokyo.

Rather than nature somehow being offended  by mankind's offenses against the environment - a very hackneyed plot premise - why not have Gaia send Godzilla to decimate all the far left liberals in San Francisco? We could have a new series in which the big guy lumbers out of the ocean to redress the local political balance. He could step on Bill Maher for example. Or bite Eric Holder.

I watched this movie last night in my Home Theater. After a couple hours I started pausing the film to see how much longer I had to watch. Not a good sign.",1411084800,2,4489,4.561490683229814

The only complaint that I have with this movie, and it seems to be more with the director's sense of drama, is the 1 or two scenes that were shot in total or almost total darkness.  I realize that the situations in which this devise is used, emphasizes what would ""naturally"" occur during the scene.  The main scene that this was used for was when a nuclear device was being transported at night and the train had been stopped for ""some mysterious reason"".  The darkness was extended for such a long time that my eyes hurt from squinting, trying to see what was going on.  That was my major complaint.  If you don't mind having your screen blacked out while watching this film, then this will not be a problem.

Being a diehard fan since I was 3 years old ( Godzilla 1985 being my first VHS tape ever) I was disappointed with Godzilla not being intimidating enough for example at one point in the film he is swimming along with Navy ships to California. In the 70's yes Godzilla was more of a guardian of Earth but I still wanted people to be terrified of him like in 1985 version.

It is probably wise to look at this movie as the Godzilla Begins of this Legendary Pictures Godzilla series. The film is not perfect, but it is still enjoyable. It has a number of problems that mainstream audiences will find bothersome, such as the amount of screen time Brian Cranston receives, as well as Aaron Taylor-Johnsons blandness as a character (although I like him as an actor). But probably the biggest disappointment for some viewers will be the teasing the film shows toward Godzillas fights against his new opponents.  Yet, despite these flaws, its at least a pretty decent offering for a Hollywood-reboot-effort of a Japanese character and property that has been endeared and loved for decades. The definite highlight of the film is Godzillas showdown against new creatures called M.U.T.O. As I previously stated, the film is not perfect.

I also do enjoy better lighting than just a dark night when it is the main sequence of fighting between creatures. The plot was way better than the 1998 version but still lacked the relative simplicity needed for a Godzilla movie to be a fave among those of use die hard fans. Sure most of the movies are a little silly, even camp if you will, but that is part of the love of Godzilla movies. All in all not one I will watch often.

Mr Edwards only had 1 movie released in America before he directed Godzilla and it was BAD overall.  Mr. Edwards has some potential but it needs refining.

For the newbie's... The big guy is not supposed to be on the screen the whole movie...

5955015,2,B00EXPOCXY,"There's a basic lack of storytelling which wrecks this movie. And I was hoping it would be halfway decent. What we have is a series of disjointed, barely related characters and story lines. Godzilla seems bored chasing these ""Muto"" bugs -- what are they about? They look like leftover ""Transformer"" special effects. The whole movie is dark, and I mean literally dark, you can't see anything half the time. Is that supposed to add suspense? Suspense is a result of STORYTELLING.

Elizabeth Olsen is very attractive and a good actress. If she wants to hang out with some fat old guy, I want to be first in line to volunteer. What a babe!

Overall? If you're a Godzilla fan, you're going to watch this thing to the end. Apparently this was directed by the same guy who directed ""Monsters"" several years ago -- the movie in which you saw virtually nothing of the titular monsters. An uninspired movie, which is baffling to me. How could you not make an interesting version of Godzilla?

As usual with summer movies, it's all special effects and you know what? By this time NO ONE CARES ABOUT SPECIAL EFFECTS. It's all been seen before and it's boring, to tell you the truth.

This movie is a real dog. Learn to tell a story. Sit around a campfire and learn to tell stories. That is the key thing that is missing in this version of Godzilla. Tell a simple, basic story and tell it the right way. It's not impossible.

fought such creatures as a smog monster, Baragon, a three headed monster (Gidera (!) and assorted other beasties and wrecked
Tokyo a number of times.  The funniest ones was where he was fighting with King Kong, one of the ugliest costumed monsters in
all the world.  I guess the Japanese don't know what apes look like.  Anyhow, those two mangled another Japanese city destroying
the Tokyo tower for one of the many times.  I would think the Japanese would get tired rebuilding that thing.  Now Godzilla takes on
San Francisco and really does a number on it..for our own good, of course.  But then, didn't 'Frisco try to ban gold fish, deodorant and circumcision (!) ?  And Godzilla did not eat our hero at the end did he?  Good monster!!

  Anyway, the movie was very entertaining for us monster buffs, special effects very good and lots of good, clean violence.  I am
of course being sarcastic, but it was fun.  Warner Bros is supposed to be working on a sequel for 2018 release; could we see more
classic monsters...Rodan or baby Godzilla.  I would like to see Gameras return.  You know, the friend of all good children of the world.  Though I hope not Mothra...I just thought that was a really phoney looking bug.  Still it would be fun  with any of them.
This movie was much better than I had hoped..Five Stars.  I got the 3d version plus the standard versions from Amazon.  The NY
version was OK but this one superior in every way.  I would, however. like Godzilla to come to Washington, D.C. and eat
Dr Sweets!!  Enjoy it!!",1410998400,2,1791,4.525
5955019,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I liked it almost as much as I hoped I would.  I think the point of a Godzilla flick should be to present a sense of dread -- to show the characters in the film that they are truly helpless against the wrath/fury/whims of Nature and its power.  Moreover, that because man dangerously experimented with atomic and nuclear powers that would wreak havoc on nature itself, mankind should be prepared to face nature's backlash.  Godzilla and the other attendant MUTO monsters are part of that backlash.

That said, I see no point in devoting serious chunks of a Godzilla flick to heavy character development.  The human characters are not the point.  The point is that humans AS A WHOLE are in jeopardy -- to focus on a small handful of them is to trivialize the jeopardy.  When a whole city is being destroyed in a three-way fight between giant monsters, do you REALLY care about the individual human characters?  Probably not.

I liked director Gareth Edwards' ""less is more"" philosophy.  The more of the monsters you see, the more cartoonish the whole affair can become.  It's a fine line when you walk between ""too much"" and ""too little"".

I think Edwards found the right balance, though I do agree that it might have been more satisfying to have Bryan Cranston's character in more of the film.  His character was the voice of reason.  His character's urgings served to underscore the theme of the film.

For those who complained there wasn't enough Godzilla in this flick, there is just as much Godzilla in this film as there was of the T-Rex in ""Jurassic Park"", and maybe even more.  Didn't hear people griping about that one.

Sadly, a lot of moviegoers today have been weaned on a couple of decades worth of action/destruction-heavy summer blockbuster films that shorten their attention spans.  Heaven forbid someone makes a movie where you have to wait more than five minutes to see a giant lizard stomping around.  This film is perhaps a tad restrained, but I think it works better than the alternative.  Too much would have been overkill.",1410998400,2,2044,4.736543909348442
5955020,4,B00EXPOCXY,"While this latest installment of Godzilla was better than many (certainly better than the 1990's turkey starring Matthew Broderick) it still seemed to lack the impact of the original Japanese version from 1954.  The way this release was hyped, we were to think that this would be an updated version to the original classic.  While there were some similarities, it's hard to improve on the somber story from the 1950's which involved a doomed love triangle in the midst of a prehistoric calamity.  The impressive black an white photography helped to underline the sad saga of a doomed city.  On the positive, the new Godzilla is quite impressive visually and there is nothing lacking in the special effects.  It is certainly worth watching, but I'm hoping that the next 'remake' will be more in line with the Japanese tale of the 50's.",1410998400,2,834,4.845070422535211
5955021,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I was really excited to see a high-profile, high-budget Godzilla movie that was better than the 1998 version (how hard should that be?). Unfortunately, I spent over an hour wondering how a Godzilla movie could avoid having Godzilla in it. Then I spent the last hour trying to understand why you would use Godzilla as little as possible in a Godzilla movie.

The movie looks and sounds great. The acting is fantastic and the characters start off as interesting. They don't waste a lot of time on goofy set pieces and jokey dialogue (I'm looking at your Roland Emmerich). The mutos are interesting looking and work well in the Godzilla universe. The reveal of the first one was a great shock and I thought the movie would pick up from there. It did not. Ultimately, the movie becomes a bad disaster movie: people we did care about keep getting their lives threatened by giant attacking monsters. Godzilla appears for the final fight (I'm not counting his swimming sequences since they were boring and repetitious) and they spend more time cutting away from what should have been an epic monster battle. The final fight should have been the big pay-off, but instead I was left wondering why the scene kept cutting away from or obscuring the battle. Ultimately, everyone cheers for the victor and we are supposed to be happy with the quick cut-away ending. Where did Godzilla come from? Why did he ""protect the earth"" and just fade out? Why did no one bother to address the use of nuclear power in a world that pushes eco-friendliness to the global culture? I was left with a lot of questions.

I had just watched the Criterion Collection edition of the original film and, by contrast, it left with me a tight drama filled with great monster scenes and no questions as to what the filmmakers were attempting to accomplish on a metaphorical level. I cannot say the same of the new film. All metaphor aside, because you shouldn't even need depth to make this movie fun, it needed a heckuva lot more monster fighting. I didn't hate it, but my wife and I both agreed we should have skipped it and watched something else.",1410998400,8,2112,4.659517426273458

Godzilla looked ok, but not with the kind of realism we saw in Jurassic Park. However, no special effects can make up for bad writing and terrible acting. The writers had a real opportunity here -- a great idea for a storyline -- triumph of nature over mankind's stupidity. It fell flat -- just didn't get off the ground. The cover of the movie is a big hint: A clumsy Godzilla is kind of lost there in the smoke and the haze.

How many times he gets knocked on his but only to get up again to continue you'll have to count for yourself.

5955053,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I have long been a kaiju fan, with Godzilla being my main favorite. I was really looking forward to this film. The classic Godzilla taken in a slightly new direction. What I ended up with was a lot of teasing, a main character that was just unbelievably lucky, and the best actor not getting even near enough screen time before getting killed off.

-Possible Spoilers-

You see Godzilla a good bit, along with the other monsters, but you never really get to see them do anything. One scene that really aggravated me was Godzilla and the M.U.T.O. (the other monster) come face to face, they are about to fight it out and you never see it. They change scenes and you see a few quick snippets on a TV screen. I don't mind a good tease, but showing the two main monsters in a film about to go at it, then not even show anything but a couple of seconds of it is not a proper movie tease. It is pulling your pants down, putting a condom on you, then running out the door.

The main character also just never really felt like he was ever in danger to you. The movie is set up so you know the main character is going to make it home to his family, therefore even in completely inescapable circumstances, you don't worry if he is going to make it. He is also extremely lucky. ""I need to get to San Francisco"" ""This train is going to San Francisco!"" ""I need on this train, I can conveniently do what you require at the moment"" If I had an ounce of the main character's luck I could win the lottery twice.

Bryan Crainston delivered as usual, but he only got to shine for a very short while before leaving the film.

Overall this felt like it was a story about a man trying to get back to his family featuring Godzilla. The military didn't feel that smart or organized. Everything happened conveniently, and overall it was kind of really predictable.",1410912000,,1839,4.318840579710145

5955075,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Those words were sung by Blue yster Cult in their hit song, ""Godzilla.""  It's a philosophy director Gareth Edwards took to heart in this summer's dazzling reboot.  A nifty title sequence sets the stage.  We learn that the presumed nuclear tests in the South Pacific of the 1950s were in fact attempts to kill the creature.  Alexandre Desplat delivers a rousing score, as we get a brief glimpse of the titular monster, his dorsal spines cresting the surface of the ocean.

Cut to 1999, a strange incident causes a Japanese nuclear power plant to go into meltdown.  Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody is our emotional hook into the film, as he spends the next 15 years trying to figure out what happened.  His son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) returns home after a tour of duty.  Having spent only a few hours with his family, he's reluctantly called to Japan to bail his father out of prison.  Joe was trespassing in the quarantine zone in an effort to discover the cause of the disaster.

Turns out it wasn't an earthquake, as reported.

Ford becomes the main focus, which brings us to the film's characters.  They are its biggest liability, especially Ford Brody.  The supporting roles are thin, but they're played by talented performers, so the mediocre writing is tolerable.  In addition to Cranston, the cast includes Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, and Sally Hawkins.  Sadly, Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't equipped to imbue his character with any gravitas or charisma, and questionable character beats and developments land with a thud.

One such moment occurs near the end of the film.  In the interest of remaining spoiler free, I'll just say Ford gives up at a critical juncture when he should be fighting tooth and nail.  Some have criticized the insignificance of the human characters in comparison to the monsters, but that isn't an inherently bad thing.  The movie just needed to derive more drama from their inability to change their fates, but make no mistake, Godzilla should confound mankind at every turn.  After all, the character was born out of Japan's anxiety over nuclear attacks.

Much has been made about Godzilla's lack of screen time - a complaint that boggles my mind.  Gareth Edwards understands, like Spielberg and Ridley Scott before him, that the quickest way to take the majesty and menace out of a main attraction is to overexpose it.  He and screenwriter Max Borenstein allow their film to build toward a distinct and succinct climax, shrewdly dolling out spectacle in small doses until the thunderous ending.  I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see filmmakers respect their audience in this regard, since so many blockbusters are structured for itchy teens.  Climax upon climax upon climax - after a while, it stops meaning anything.

Edwards and Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey rigorously adopt P.O.V. camerawork, with much of the action being framed from the ground level.  This creates dynamic scale, placing us in the action and giving the film a genuine sense of awe that's been missing from multiplexes.  So many blockbuster directors are seduced by their budgets, and they use shots that showcase their resources but fail to involve the audience.

Despite the bleak subject matter, and contrary to a popular criticism that the film takes itself too seriously, Edwards knows how to have a good time.  Just as things starts to heat up, he wryly cuts away from a bit of action at the Honolulu International Airport.  (Gotta leave enough fuel in the tank for the big finish.)  Elvis Presley's ""Devil in Disguise"" scores the destruction of Las Vegas.  And there are so many playful uses of the camera.  As Ford waits on a tram to get to his flight, the power goes out.  When the lights come back on, we follow their progress from inside the tram.  Suddenly, they illuminate this hulking titan as it lumbers into the airport.  It's a motivated camera move and provides a nice little scare.

And Edwards isn't just adept at money shots.  He's got a true filmmaker's eye, hanging entire sequences on simple images that are so lo-fi, they could have come from his low-budget debut, ""Monsters.""  The camera lingers on an empty hallway in a power plant in crisis, as we anxiously wait to see what will round the corner.  A group of marines storm a nuclear waste site searching for...something.  Nothing out of the ordinary in the first two containment facilities, but when a marine pulls back a sliding door on the third one, he's greeted with a blinding shaft of light.  What's that about?

""The arrogance of man is assuming nature is in our control, and not the other way around,"" Watanabe's Dr. Serizawa intones.  It's there in the way tsunami waters wipe away a coastal street.  It's there in the way a dog surveys bodies at a train wreck.  And it's there in the way nature has retaken the quarantined city in Japan, plants and animals clinging to every surface.  Rest assured, nature will retake more major cities before the movie's over.",1410825600,,5011,4.867612293144208

5955077,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Even the American version of the original Godzilla had Raymond Burr.  Other than Ken Watanabe...who is not exactly an A or B-list actor, had virtually no lines and basically stared at everyone...who were all of these people?  You knew none of the actors and they didn't hold your attention and they couldn't carry the film.

I agree with those who say that this movie could have been so much more...and it wasn't.  Had there been actors in the movie who could have carried it during the slow parts of the plot, it wouldn't have dragged so much.

Godzilla and the two MUTOs were great insofar as the action and special effects aspects of the movie were...but they only appeared in the movie for less than 15 minutes.  Was I watching Godzilla or an reinvention of Cloverdale?  A Godzilla movie where Godzilla isn't even a supporting actor?  Really?  Any fan of Godzilla movies will tell you that Godzilla has to be the star of the movie and he was barely in this movie!  When you couple that with no one who could hold your attention, then you have the basic flaw of what could have been a great film.

Godzilla doesn't need to be reinvented.  GODZILLA IS THE GREATEST MONSTER OF ALL TIMES!  LET GODZILLA BE GODZILLA!  That means that he is supposed to DOMINATE the movie, kick some serious butt and stomp on something or somebody!

Subtlety is NOT what Godzilla is about.

I didn't hate the movie...but what a letdown!  The plot wasn't helped by either absence of interesting actors who could carry the film or the absence of Godzilla and the MUTOs.  The movie wasn't greater...or even as great...as the sum of the parts.  The parts of the movie just didn't help each other.

5955080,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla (2014) does a plethora of creative acts correctly: slow pacing with sound storytelling, well constructed characters, terrific acting, great effects, and a satisfying, climactic monster battle. Unlike it's campier, Japanese brethren or the horrific 1998, Matthew Broderick, reboot; this film attempted to place the king of massive monsters in an ultra-realistic world. This definitely gave the film a darker, heavier tone, which is why quality actors who delivered their lines with emotion and sincerity were integral to pushing the camp boundary into believable territory.

I definitely was impressed with the films overall quality and execution, BUT, and there is always a but--the film focused way too much on the human element. I understand the teaser cut scenes to get the viewer's synapses to fire off happy, excitable thoughts, eventually making the final confrontation a visually, orgasmic scene for the ages, but the snippets eventually wore on my patience. Eventually making me scrutinize the film and pick apart the plot's many shortcomings. The major issue being the debacle when the military decided to move a nuclear warhead, via train, in the path of the antagonizing monster's trajectory. I was also tired of watching Ford Brody fumble about scene to scene. Let me stress that Aaron Taylor-Johnson played his part admirably, and with not nearly half the cheese of Brad Pitt's, World War Z hero. Still, I felt his scenes were drawn out way too much and Godzilla's were cut too short. The giant, city-destroying behemoths of doom felt more like a background element to his and his family's story. Godzilla was more atmospheric than driving force, which is not the case in any other giant monster film save this one. This peeved me more than perhaps a little.

The best way I can explain my disappointment would be like this. You know the excitement that follows some UFC or boxing matches? Where two quality rivals who have never met in the arena finally agree to slug it out? Such fights create an enormous amount of hype, which in turn creates an even greater amount of expectation. Then when it happens it's either a first round knockout or a drawn out feeler fight, where both gladiators are respectful of each other's power. Either outcome would bring a modicum of disappointment. This is what I felt like after waiting patiently to see Godzilla's final battle: not fully disappointed, but somewhat underwhelmed.

I guess it's all relative to expectation. Whether the film is of excellent quality and script doesn't really matter. When you watch a
DeNiro driven mob-drama you expect to see lots of DeNiro acting his ass off. Likewise, I don't watch the Trailer Park Boys in the hopes of learning more about meaning of life.

5955082,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Any Science Fiction Nerd will recognize the comment made by Star Trek's Mr. Spock of the old Vulcan proverb, Only Nixon could go to China. Well This film makes me think, ""Only Toho Studio can make a Gojira movie."" The other ""American"" Godzilla movie with Matthew Broderick was bad. This one wasn't exactly what could be called good so it compares to the previous American effort.
(Sad to admit that but truth must out.)

The Pros:
The visual effects were good and the creature effects were top notch. (Explosions, fires, buildings falling, etc.)
The audio effects were great. The Kaiju destroyed buildings and the sounds of tinkling glass falling was there. Something Toho never thought of apparently.
The iconic Gojira roar (produced by dragging a heavily rosined leather glove over the strings of a Cello or Bass) was not used. The new sound effect was pretty good - yeah, this review is a technical aspects comment but it makes a difference from the original Godzilla we all grew up with.
The Gojira (Godzilla) Creature looked awesome from the skin texture to the gills. (Good SFX.)

The Cons:
The story wasn't what I'd have expected of a Kaiju (Strange Creature) movie.
The acting and casting were just so-so. Film actors were not very familiar to me so I don't know if they were A-List actors or not.
The female actors weren't the ""bright but beautiful"" Japanese girls the old films used. This gave the characters a more real life look. But one would expect at least one ""beauty"" to be one of the protagonists. (That's the Toho way.)
There was definitely a ""It has been done before"" feeling to the story and script. Husband and wife (with child) being separated and everyone in danger plot. (Usually seen in volcano or other disaster movies.)
The failure of the director and producer to actually look into how nuclear power works was evident.
One character removes his breathing apparatus while in a supposed contamination area and sniffs the air and proclaims there is no radiation contamination. In real life, you can't smell radiation or the byproducts (contamination). Dumb! Extremely stupid as a matter of fact. Can't forgive Hollywood for the lack of research. Liberal 'Nuke Plant' haters never get the facts right.

5955084,2,B00EXPOCXY,"First of all, I love the movie. I'm not here to debate the merits of the film itself, merely to talk about the Blu-Ray release.

It's really lazy. I mean, like, shockingly lazy. The quality of the image seems to be great, which is no surprise. However, the darkness of the film has been a recognized, common complaint. They should have known that this was going to be played in people's homes, and the image definitely needs brightening to be enjoyed on any level. I've been playing with my TV levels, and in my opinion there is just only so much I can really do before I wash out any other show or movie I watch. This is an issue with the movie itself.

The sound is enjoyable; not a single complaint there.

This release is one of the laziest and poorest examples of modern Blu-Rays I've ever seen. The main menu is this static image of the poster/box cover with 5 little buttons you can select that have no theme related to the movie. The soundtrack depressingly plays in the background as a brief reminder that at least two people (the one who selected the music and the one who selected the image) knew what movie this was for.

The menus are easy enough to navigate, but don't offer any sort of deeper experience as so many Blu-Rays do these days. The options are standard (see: boring). And the chapter selection appears to be done in the simplest of manners. Someone clearly just went through and broke the movie up into 10-minute segments and placed the chapter start at the closest cut in the film. To highlight how lazy this truly is, there isn't even a clean chapter break between the opening credits and the start of the movie! The chapters themselves do not serve to smoothly place you in a different act or scene of the movie; they just roughly move you from where you are to 10 minutes from where you are.

This movie has been panned by a lot of people for the moments when Godzilla and the MUTOs aren't on screen. The producers of this release should have known that people would be wanting to pop in the disc and use the chapters to get to their favorite fight scenes. Or... even just to skip the opening credits with one smooth button push while not missing any story. Instead, you will have to manually fast-forward through the movie to get to your favorite scenes.

I never thought that the structure of a Blu-Ray would be my critical point on a movie's home release. I loved this movie, a LOT. I was so excited to own it, and perhaps that is ultimately why I am so disappointed. But considering the impressive amount of time and effort that have clearly gone into other Blu-Ray releases, I absolutely can not believe how poorly this one was done. The movie was liked well enough in the box office to deserve more than this. I don't know who to blame for this... but they should be ashamed.",1410825600,6,2811,4.427466150870406

5955087,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla has had a great run but it may be time to bestow some lifetime achievement awards on him and find him a nice gated retirement community. Hes still the big lumbering lummox we all know and love but he cant shriek the high notes anymore and he hasn't hit the gym in a while.

The plot, such as it is, begins with bait for conspiracy buffs. Theres some semblance of human drama tossed in (the nutty father who was right/family separated in crisis) but the main event is a cage match with Godzilla taking on a couple upstart monsters, who look like the person who designed the 73 Olds Toronado redid Alien, who have the urge to merge. They pick San Francisco for their tryst, as many lovers are won't to do.

And thats where Godzilla will take them on. Enter the WWE, because this has the unmistakable choreography of a professional wrestling championship bout. Godzilla goes down for the count more times than Brock Lesnar on a greased skating rink, but somehow manages to pick himself up off the canvas just when it appeared he was finished. If that isn't schmaltzy enough, he manages to exchange a meaningful look with the human protagonist while stretched out on the street. Its only by finally summoning up his signature move, super-heated morning breath, that he manages to dispatch the pretenders to the throne. The human star mops up with another homage to Alien, the destruction of the embryos.

And, in victory, Godzilla collapses, apparently in death. But, no, wait, he once again resurrects himself and humbly and peacefully plods into the sea, possibly setting up a dreaded sequel.

The special effects are pretty well done. The actors have little to do except recite banal script and run around, ineptly bumping into each other, a la Keystone Kops.

The original GODZILLA was a monster. In fact, the 1954 movie was publicized as GODZILLA, King of the Monsters. It this movie, he doesn't show up until late in the movie in order to save the world from two goofy creations called ""Mutos"". They look like something made from Lego blocks, as dull and uninteresting as anything I've ever seen outside of THE MONOLITH MONSTERS. They live on energy. (SNORE). Godzilla shows up in the last reel to save the world.

Now, look here! Godzilla is a Monster! He's not the U.S. cavalry! The film should have been set entirely in Japan! Godzilla should have trampled all over Tokyo all he wanted to.

What a disappointment. I want my money back.",1410825600,11,933,4.636363636363637

Rather disappointed in that the main reason we watched was because Malcolm's dad (Malcolm in the middle) was in it, but then they killed him off and we were left wondering who the main character was supposed to be. We were even half expecting them to bring him back to life somehow, because he was carrying the movie up until that point. It was definitely different than I expected, but then I am one of the few who actually liked the 1998 version of Godzilla. The effects were really good and the story was a surprise, but I had a hard time caring whether the main couple survived or not, especially after Bryan Cranston's character died.",1410739200,2,654,4.5508474576271185
5955121,3,B00EXPOCXY,"First off, let me just say that I loved this film. As someone who lived his childhood watching Godzilla marathons on the old WWOR here in New York, there was no way I was going to hate this movie. Hell, I even tolerated the 1998 Devlin - Emmerich abortion that called itself ""Godzilla"". And after watching Gareth Edwards' effort, I was not disappointed in the least; I walked away from the film excited that someone *finally* got Godzilla and treated it (him?) the way it deserved. Godzilla here is portrayed as an unstoppable force of nature that will pretty much do whatever it wants; all we can do is hope to weather the storm. It worked magnificently in the 1954 film and it does so here as well.

Why only 3 stars, then? Because at many points ""Godzilla"" felt like ""Monsters"", Edwards' debut film. For the uninitiated, ""Monsters"" deals with two characters who are trying to make their way through the Mexico border into the U.S. after an extraterrestrial invasion; unfortunately for them, the border has been designated a quarantine zone, infested by gigantic Cloverfield monster-like extraterrestrials. As the last ferry providing safe passage into the US has left them behind, they must traverse the dangerous quarantine zone if they want to reach the U.S.. If some of this sounds familiar, it's because some of those concepts made their way into"" Godzilla"": the quarantine zone and the giant Cloverfield-like monsters (I don't know why so many reviewers refer to the MUTO, or Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism, as ""Gigeresque""; IMHO there was nothing bio-mechanical or sexualized about the MUTO design to compare it to a Giger creation), the main character trying to get back home and having to go through monster attack after monster attack in order to do so, as well as scenes where the E.T.s pick up and smash trucks and whatnot. Clearly ""Monsters"" was a test run for Edwards for his later, more ambitious work on ""Godzilla"". Unfortunately, I sat through the latter feeling like I was watching a big(ger) budget re-imagining of the former.

More importantly, Edwards uses over 3/4 of ""Godzilla"" to focus on the human characters. Unlike ""Monsters"" where the leads' acting skills were in line with their B-movie actor status, here there's just SO much missed opportunity when it comes to the characters. First off, I have to concur with the majority of the people on Bryan Cranston; he chews every last bit of scenery, spits it out,then chews on it some more as Joe Brody, a father and husband on a Fox Mulder-like search for the truth. He is BY FAR the most interesting character in the film, and yet receives maybe a little bit more screen time than Godzilla. Juliette Binoche is absolutely wasted in this film, relegated to a 5-minute cameo. David Strathairn as a Navy Admiral is reduced to essentially spouting orders whilst attempting to make as mean a face as he can. But perhaps the most unforgivable slight comes down to the utilization, or lack thereof, of Ken Watanabe. As someone who still to this day loves Akihiko Hirata's portrayal of the brilliant but doomed scientist Daisuke Serizawa in the original 1954 film, I sat there waiting to be blown away by Watanabe's Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (it's never stated whether this Serizawa is related to Hirata's character). Instead, Watanabe is reduced to standing in the background, asked for his sage advice only after the military decides to bomb the daylights out of Godzilla and the MUTOs. In fact, after Serizawa is asked for his advice, he states that the monsters should just be allowed to battle each other and let nature takes its course. His ""let them fight"" line is so laughably bad, I halfway expected the techno beats of ""Mortal Kombat"" to start playing when he finished. I was left utterly disappointed with the underutiliization of such a (potentially) wonderful cast.

Which brings us to the single, biggest failure of this film: the leads, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. The 2 most wooden actors in the film are the ones that Edwards chooses to make the centerpiece for humanity in his film. Early in the film, Taylor-Johnson's Ford Brody dismisses his father's obsession with finding the truth behind the 1999 nuclear reactor meltdown that claimed the life of his mother as a  Quixotic crusade, only to later learn that the Japanese government has been hiding the true nature of the meltdown. And at that moment of truth.... nothing. His father's suspicions and obsession have finally been vindicated and his reaction borders on annoyance sprinkled in with some boredom, as if someone told him that the cafeteria cashier shortchanged him a nickel. And Elizabeth Olsen is no better. Her acting repertoire apparently consists of opening her eyes wider depending on the severity of the danger. Monsters on TV? Slightly open. Hospital being evacuated? A little bit more wide open. Monsters attacking? Eyes wide open. Building crumbling down around her? Oh now you KNOW she's scared because her eyes look like they're going to pop out of her head. Neither Taylor-Johnson nor Olsen do anything to make us feel empathy or sympathy for these characters, and their reunion at the end of the film elicits a big fat yawn.

Now, that's not to say that there's NOTHING good with the film. Like I said previously, I loved this film and it's all because of the Big G. The design for this Godzilla makes him look like a powerhouse worthy of the moniker ""King of the Monsters"", while retaining the familiarity of the classic Toho monster; the famous roar has been updated to make it sound more animalistic yet still familiar; and when Godzilla busts out the nuclear fire breath it is an amazing display that makes you want to cheer (which happened at my viewing). Additionally, the designs for the MUTOs, while clearly inspired by the Cloverfield monster, nonetheless are impressive in their own right, especially the nice little ""males and females have different characteristics"" tidbit thrown in by Edwards. The monster fights are amazingly choreographed; indeed, that's when Edwards' direction shines. Unlike the old Godzilla films, the devastation created by the monsters is on a scale never before seen in a Godzilla film. If nothing else, the fight scenes were unbridled fun and obviously the highlights of the film. And kudos to Edwards for making this a ""Godzilla versus"" film; he could have just taken the easy (lazy) way out and made it another ""overmatched scientists and army vs. Godzilla and they win by a fluke"" film, but instead he masterfully sets up future entries in the series by evoking the tried-and-true Toho finish: Godzilla triumphant, swimming away with the people having gained a grudging respect for the King of the Monsters.

In the end, impressive as Edwards' handling of Godzilla may be, the individual parts of the film were much better than the whole. Unlike some of the reviews which make no bones about the fact that they were disappointed that Godzilla only appeared for 11 minutes, that was not fatal to the film. Indeed, like Spielberg's ""Jaws"", the glimpses that we do catch of the monster, and the full-blown reveal in the climax of the film, finally get you excited for the destruction that you have been waiting for all film long. It doesn't disappoint. If you can look past the miscasting and just plain bad handling of the actors in the film, you'll do yourself a big favor, because this is one fun movie.",1410739200,4,7429,4.901430842607313
5955122,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Don't listen to the haters =P This is a great movie, even if you've never been a die-hard Godzilla fan. (I for one am a die-hard Godzilla fan). Definitely don't expect a ton of cheesy action like Pacific Rim, or Bryan Cranston as the protagonist, because neither of those are present in this film. The action sequences towards the end are fantastic, but there's not much of it (you can expect a lot more action in the sequel in 2018, given the appearances of Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah) Overall, this is a great movie, and I can't wait till 2018 to see the next one!",1410739200,3,572,4.40566037735849
5955123,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Amazing movie. The pensive build up of this movie really magnifies the sheer awe of the perspective shots which show the terror that mere humans face in the oncoming devsastation unleashed by the Alpha Predator's hunt. I really felt amazed when the camera showed a seemingly normal event which would reveal a small indication of the forthcoming destruction, such as the tide getting sucked out, or a fierce battle raging on the other side of the hill. Then the MUTO would come and the camera would pan and zoom showing the scale of the creature as it devastates everything.

What all these people who are rating this movie poorly fail to understand is that the anticipation is what makes the massive fight scenes at the end so magnificent. It establishes the the capabilities and the scale of the fight in a human perspective and allows you to appreciate it fully. The people who claim the film is lame because Godzilla isn't onscreen for 90 minutes would also say Jaws sucked because it wasn't a movie about a fish swimming around for 90 minutes eating stuff. There is no other appropriate method for doing this movie. The CGI was masterful and worthy. The cinematography was beautiful and shot from optium positions. I am impressed by this director, and for the people who hated this movie, please enjoy your corny plots from Micheal Bay every two years.

The acting was appropriate for the roles, because it displayed two different temperments in the face of an unstoppable force. The frenetic terror of Cranston, and his duty bound soldier son who is forced to confront such an unrelenting catastophe. He has the emotionally dismissive stare of other war movie actors like Full Metal Jacket without all the profanity while he maintains his composure and professionalism.

Overall, all elements are well thought out and executed brilliantly. For a monster movie, this movie is supreme. I hope the sequel isn't dumbed down by trying to ease the critics complaining that this movie isn't Transformers junior. It is worth your movie dollars, but definitely best seen on the biggest screen you can find.",1410739200,3,2102,4.898876404494382

5955128,2,B00EXPOCXY,"I wasn't expecting movie of the year, but I was expecting something rather enjoyable, unfortunately Godzilla was not really all that enjoyable at all especially since there was so much time, money, and promotion put into this film. All of it was hype, because the film was eh.. just blah. The special effects were good, and yes there was plenty of Godzilla smashing, and ripping cities a-part while battling other giant monsters/parasites. Which is probably why so many people have given this movie a good review, they had the opportunity to see massive monsters destroy in battle, when has that not been cool?

But everything else about the movie is bad, and I mean I could barely keep focused while watching the film, it was just silly, boring, and terribly acted. The acting is what sealed this movies fate for me, the actors were unbelievable in there character portrayals, Let me start off by saying I like Aaron Taylor Johnson, but oh man he was very bad in this film, In my opinion he was a miscast, and I'm not sure if he even felt comfortable trying to pull off a lead character such as the one in the film (a married solider with a son, and daddy issues) His American accent was very young sounding, I think his fans should skip this one, it might change there view on him as actor. All the other actors were dull, like they were just reading lines. And the actor who played the father was over the top, and made the film seem like a cheesy made-for-tv movie.

Going into this one my only real expectation was that it will be better than that one. I was not wrong. That said the movie I think tried to do too much. The first half of the movie was watching the scientists try to figure out what was going on. When you sit down to watch a monster movie you really want to get right to the action. This is a movie I will review in two aspects. When the monsters were not on the screen the movie was a little slow moving and hard to stay interested in. The entire time you are just thinking blah, blah, blah lets see action. On the other hand when the monsters are on screen and fighting the movie is entertaining and I could have watched a movie of just that.

5955177,4,B00EXPOCXY,"More of a 3 1/2. I am so torn about this flic. Part of me wants to praise, adore, and love this flick, the other condemn it.
So the plot is Bryan Cranston's wife is killed in a nuclear accident. Yadda yadda yadda, government conspiracy, giant monsters, Godzilla, etc.

Well one good thing about this movie is Godzilla. He looks like Godzilla should look, he has a smaller head so that his body looks thicker and stronger, the texture is nice, and get this... they gave him gills to breath underwater. you never get a good look but if u get a good look at a close up still image you see slits like gills on the sides of his throat.
Another good thing was the monsters. While they are not classic monsters they are still pretty cool, one resembling Colverfeild and the other a bat or a moth (Rodan or Mothra nod, maybe?) The male is killed in a sorta dumb way while the female has the coolest death ever.
Another good thing is Cranston and Wattanabe. THESE TWO should've been the main characters, not two people who have little character or acting in this movie. Cranston plays the main character's supposedly deranged dad, and Wattanabe plays Dr Serizowa (probably spelled that wrong). I LOVE the idea of Serizowa being in this movie like in the original, even if he is the token Asian man. But Cranston (spoiler) despite having the most screen time in the trailer, DIES 30 MINUTES IN! And Wattanabe has 2 memorable lines of dialogue, ""Godzilla"" and ""Let them fight."" Other than that he stares at everything.

Now the really bad stuff. I am going to start off with two problems go hand in hand. 1 is there is a Godzilla cameo. No, I'm serious! He gets 11 minutes 16 seconds of screen time in a 2 hour 2 minute movie! They wait for like an hour (which I get what they are doing, trying to build excitement for his reveal) And starting off he does rather well. They keep him behind buildings and in the shadows for about a minute, then have him roar an awesome roar Jurassic Park T-Rex style! Awesome! Then, he goes to fight the monster. I remember thinking ""Yes, the first fight, the miniboss, here it is! And Godzilla and the Muto charge, Godzilla grabs Muto, AND IT CUTS TO A LIVING ROOM WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTER'S WIFE IS AT WITH GODZILLA ON THE TV! Like, you see Godzilla throw the Muto, snap at him, and new scene. A 45 second or so fight. The whole movie is like this, showing clips of the battle while focusing primarily on the humans. Problem 2, the humans r boring! I wouldn't mind spending more of the movie with the main character rather than the title character if I cared about him. But he is so clichd and such a jerk (He tells his wife he will be home the next day, and doesn't return for three days and never warns her about the monsters heading STRAIGHT FOR THE CITY SHE LIVES IN!
Stupid side characters and extras. Example, in a nuclear base in a Nevada mountain some soldiers go and check to see if Muto number 2 is there. And the thing literally tore through the wall and the mountain, leaving destruction everywhere... and they didn't hear it. Not the soldiers, staff or anything. It's flat out dumb.
The guy is the only soldier who knows how to disarm a bomb!
And, the biggest... worst part... the menacing.... scary looking Godzilla... who drowned hundreds of people when he flooded a city in Hawaii.. IS A GOOD GUY! HE NEVER PERPUSEFULLY DESTROYS ANYTHING! Godzilla arrives at the Golden Gate Bridge. Does he destroy it, yes. Is it intentional? NO! The military shoots at Godzilla, who if they miss they will shoot civillians, and knock him into the bridge. One of the things I wanted to see in this movie was Godzilla smash up a city... heck I wanted to see Godzilla, but over half his screen time is in water with the shot on his spines, his feet, his tail, or shrouded in smoke, even after we see him. And Godzilla kills the monsters, gets up, roars in victory........ and just walks away. Not smashing one thing, the whole city cheers him on as he leaves.

All in all, is this movie better than the Emerich one.. debateful. Now before you cast a spell to send me to hell or higher a bounty hunter to snipe me, let me explain Why. For one thing, Godzilla 1998 was the first Godzilla movie I saw when I was 6, so it holds a special place in my heart. Also, Godzilla may look wrong, but he has the right attitude! Protect his children. feed his children, fight the military, smash the city. He is more animalistic. In the new one, it is said nature awoke Godzilla because there cannot be one thing that is impossible to take down. So two skinny monsters who just wanna breed are a threat to the balance of nature... bt a 400 foot tall dinosaur is completely ok. In fact, I have an idea for a movie. If his job is to keep the peace basically, have him fight Chuck Norris. Yeah! Think about that. Godzilla, the almost undefeated monster, vs Norris, the almost undefeated human (Bruce Lee beat him)

5955202,3,B00EXPOCXY,"There is a line of dialogue spoken in the last half of this year's GODZILLA that encapsulates the film so well it must be cosmic karma. The line is spoken by David Strathairn, who grimly inquires of his aides, ""Where is Godzilla?"". This sums up perfectly the flaws of Gareth Edwards' otherwise rather breath-taking monster movie. The movie is _called_ Godzilla. The trailers _showed_ Godzilla. We came to _see_ Godzilla. So where in the heck IS Godzilla? So, before we embark on my review on Godzilla, let me remind you that this is just my subjective opinion on the movie, and I'll try not to lose you, because this could get really deep.

First off, the saddest part is that Godzilla could have been so much greater. The trailers certainly showed us the potential (Godzilla, in my opinion, had one of the best marketing campaigns in recent memory). Here was a chance to make a movie that was epic, awe-inspiring and fast-paced, packed with action, humor and the kind of insanity you'd expect from a movie about a 400-foot monster with radioactive breath, fighting other monsters that look like the lovechild of H.R. Giger, a cobra and a butterfly. Instead we get a long movie (that feels much longer) saturated with a thick sense of doom, a convoluted plot that moves at a glacial pace, a collection of dour performances, a sprinkle of jaw-dropping fight scenes and apocalyptic imagery, and a little something thrown in on the side about...scientific hubris? nature out of whack? And all the while things are missing: a sense of fun and adventure, action, and namely, Godzilla.

Let's start with the plot. The way I remember it, GODZILLA is about these evil, flying MUTO's that Godzilla has to fight. Everything else, from the romantic subplot to the military subplot, to the symbolism to the setting to the ridiculous leaps of the imagination that are asked of the viewers is utterly secondary. The film moves at the pace of a lumbering behemoth, as characters go places, talk about things, and make you wonder why they're in the film at all. On the side, there is some action thrown in there. And you'll be happy when it comes, because it is utterly awesome, in the truest sense of the word. More on that later.

Let's talk a little about the acting. Consider last year's monster movie: Pacific Rim. A sincere and often goofy ode to kaiju, in every frame of the movie, every actor and every crewman is having fun. Characters have names like Hannibal Chau and Newton Geiszler. Godzilla has characters with names like Joe Brody and Ford Brody. Everybody plays their roles with grim faces and serious intonations. The only one having fun is Bryan Cranston, who chews the scenery with relish and gets all the best lines. The humans are utterly secondary to the monsters, and some of them have little to no impact on the plot at all. I'm certain there's at least one scientist or soldier who did zilch to advance the plot.

Now, I'm perfectly happy to not see the monster for a while, a la Jaws. We don't fully see the T-Rex or King Kong until almost 45 minutes into their movies, and we feel satisfied. But it works because in the meantime we're spending time with interesting and cool human characters like Alan Grant and Carl Denham. In Godzilla, talented actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn play cookie-cutter, thick, white bread characters that interest nobody. You'll be aching to see more than the monster equivalent of a little ankle. But maybe all of this works out in the end. Because when Godzilla goes the full monty, we are so pumped.

And that's where Godzilla gets good. That's why you should see the movie. Because when director Gareth Edwards finally gets room to gallop, he freaking gallops. The man has an eye for a stunning image, and he scatters the movie with the kind of jaw-dropping, terrifying, beautiful imagery you expected from the trailer. An abandoned city, given over to nature; a giant kaiju wreathed in smoke; trails of red smoke over a fiery San Francisco, the sheer bulk and might of Godzilla unleashed in the moonlight...these are images that will stay with me. Speaking of our titular character, when he DOES show up, he's unbelievably impressive. Edwards and the visual effects department have conjured up what might just be the best-looking Godzilla yet. They've captured a creature of immense bulk and weight and size, a force of nature...an ""alpha predator"" that makes the might of Uncle Sam's war machine look like ants carrying little sticks. His foes - the MUTO's, look equally impressive: a vaguely Giger-esque cross between a butterfly, praying mantis, cobra, and bat. They have glowing red eyes and crooked limbs and they fly like your worst nightmare. When these kaiju fight, they fight! The battle between Godzilla and the MUTO's is a hugely impressive action scene. It has weight and gravitas - this ain't the flashy glitz of Transformers or Marvel - this is big, scary, epic warfare that will leave you in awe. I wish we saw more of Godzilla, and less of...Ford Brody.

In conclusion, Godzilla does have some amazing action scenes and is visually stunning. When Godzilla is on the screen, the movie inspires awe and wonder. When he's off - and unfortunately that's for a major portion of the screentime, the film collapses under the weight of its dense, slow-moving plot, cookie cutter characters, and lack of action. But while Godzilla has its impact lessened, it is by no means a film you should avoid. I recommend the movie as a collection of unforgettable and gorgeous images and action scenes, separated by dense filler. If this Godzilla isn't the King of the Monsters, he's at least an Archduke. Maybe a Count. Or a Prince Regent.
Godzilla, Prince Regent of the Monsters, gets 3 stars from me.

5955220,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I am certain that my Wife would give this 5 stars.  I give Godzilla 4 stars for a couple reasons.  First off it was visually awesome!  The special effects were amazing.  But the movie starts out a little slow then seems to have trouble coming together.  It isn't quite sure of itself; is this a monster movie? or an epic action movie?  In my opinion it couldn't really commit and I feel like this was due to its being marketed to appeal to the largest audience which I feel is its only downfall.

Otherwise it stays true to the films of the 60's and 70's in many subtle ways unlike the previous version with Matthew Broderick.  Lots of violence but otherwise lots of action.  Not overly gory and filmed less shaky than Cloverfield (and not as depressing!).  I had to turn the brightness up on my TV quite a bit it is filmed in a dark apocalyptic style.

Back story on the monsters was barely touched on.... not in a mysterious way but seemed more of an oversight.  Lots of back story on the characters almost too much and a bit predictable.  When I'm seeing a monster movie I expect monster with a capital M!",1410307200,,1108,4.3463414634146345

I saw the movie the first day it came out and I was blown away, I literally had tears in my eyes while watching the movie Garth Edwards did an amazing job bringing Godzilla to the screen. The acting was awesome and the special effects were out of this world. I can't wait for Godzilla 2. Hope this review was helpful!",1410307200,,569,4.135135135135135

5955246,5,B00EXPOCXY,"This is a truly amazing monster movie. Director Edwards does the very best anyone could possibly do with this material, which is somewhat dated and has a legacy and a world of devoted fans spanning over more than two generations. Surprising casting choices and interesting variations on the traditional Godzilla theme make for an exciting film. The scriptwriters introduce the idea of ancient giant monstrous mutated adversaries that Godzilla must battle in order to restore natural harmony to the world. Mind boggling special effects and action in well known locations like Honolulu and San Francisco make for ultra-realistic horror and excitement. Director Edwards nails the mysterious terror of the classic monster movie as he depicts two soldiers watching in horror as a huge monster consumes a nuclear warhead like a snack. The director pays tribute to classic horror concepts but also remembers to show things from the perspective of the terrified human observer, which makes the experience more real because the viewer relates to the human characters. Just plain great. A must see. One very minor complaint: dispense with the traditional night time Godzilla attack. Dark battle scenes in San Francisco are hard to see. Better to have it play out under overcast daytime skies, which is how many of the classic Toho productions were shot, although I realize the director is going for a certain dark foreboding mood, but special effects have been perfected, so no reason to shoot them all in the dark of night.",1410307200,,1514,5.133603238866397

Aaron Tyler-Johnson...he needs to stop acting. He makes everyone around him look and sound about as stupid as he looks and sounds! If they could've killed him off and made Elizabeth Olsen the main character, the movie would've been better. Or, better yet, put the title character in more scenes! I came for Godzilla, but what I got was awkward and forced acting from the two characters I was supposed to be rooting for. When I can tell the main couple would much rather lick rusty nails than be anywhere around each other, that's a problem. It was kind of painful and funny, but still.

The best part of the movie, hands down, was the fight scene and destruction caused by Godzilla and the other creatures. That alone made me feel like I didn't waste my $11.",1410220800,6,986,4.564971751412429

Oh. My. Gosh. This has to be among the worst movies I have ever seen.  I am not sure if it was my TV, the video itself or what, but more than half of this movie is filmed in the dark. And I mean dark. As in you can't see anything at all. Like, I thought my flatscreen was going out kind of dark.  Strike that. There are a few clear scenes of course..thats just until Godzilla shows up. He must be camera shy or something, because whenever he shows up on the scene..it's either at night, in a cave, underground..anywhere except where you can actually see him. You can hear Godzilla, but you never really see him in  the light until the end. The other creature looks more like some metal creation that you can't even suspend your belief to get into. Super fake. AND I double dog dare you not to laugh as you watch Godzilla's final scene. I can't figure out if my little brother actually did really like this movie as he said when he recommended it to me..or if he was playing one of his practical jokes. But note to self : ""don't take any more movie recommendations from him"". The acting was so subpar and the writing worse.. I cannot, for the life of me, see what anybody thought was great about this film. Yeesh!

I am giving this movie One Star because I cannot give it Zero.",1410134400,10,1378,4.224334600760456
5955312,5,B00EXPOCXY,"now, i know many people can pick and crap all over this movie with it's problems or whatever.
but me, as a seasoned Godzilla watcher since a very young age i can honestly say i LOVED this movie.
here is why.

1. and thank christo for this, the Godzilla Mythos were kept to it's near origins.
G's design is in my opinion is perfect and looked like a rendition of G we'd see in newer ToHo films wether
they come to be after this saga or not. some say his head is too small. or his feet look stupid.. but CMON
are you really gonna knock this Godzilla after what ZILLA looked like in 1998? cmon.

2. while this is the most criticized part of the film. i really did enjoy the story. not even as a Godzilla fanboy
just as a movie watcher. sure Aaron Taylor Johnson was a blank slate of  DURRR THE BOMB THINGY.
but i'd expect nothing more from a soldier coming home from a long service.
you see him happy when needed, pissed, mad, and determined when needed. i liked the fact that Godzilla
was kept at a minimum for the FIRST film. yes i know what you're thinking ""OH HE'S GONNA COMPARE IT TO JAWS or THE ORIGINAL"". nope. what i think was quite genius of director Gareth Edwards to do with this, was the sheer PAYOFF, plus.. everyone at this point whom was not keeping up with the Millennium series from 1999 to 2004 was expecting Godzilla to be front in center like Roland Emmerich's ZILLA in 1998. i think Edwards knew this, and not only wanted to avoid this, but eliminate an over-usage of too much Godzilla. so when he was on the screen it was a payoff. though i do agree there was too much teasing.

3.) they kept this film to a line in which wether it did badly or good there didn't need to be a sequel, or there could be one. they didn't send this one off so it could be ""YEP THERE YA GO. NO MORE"" like some other movies did where it'd put the writers in a block. they kept it open at the very end.

other things i could say about the film are that i loved Hok-muto and Fe-muto as ""villain"" kaijus. they really became fleshed out
surprisingly, where you could root for G to smash their faces in, and then actually feel kinda bummed for them. the scene of them meeting up where they nudge and make those weird purring sounds was BEAUTIFUL and reminiscent of Edwards' first film MONSTERS. when Taylor Johnson's character destroys the nest and you see Fe-muto cry out in sadness you really do feel her pain. and the minute she sees Johnson's character she knew ""HE DID IT!"" and she goes for him! very human yet animalistic at the same time. while some call them boring, and un-inspired ""seen it before""-ers i personally liked the pair. and i think they were a great start to many more CRAZY-NESS to come in the series. i mean now that King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan are confirmed for part II... like c'mon AWESOME.
theres not much else i could say about this film except, the acting was decent, the CGI scenes were beautiful, bummed Brian Cranston died so early, loved Alexndre Desplat's soundtrack (absolutely beautiful may i add) and the merchandise like figures, shirts, back-packs, ETC ETC are all fantastic so far.

over-all i really liked GODZILLA. i had waited for this film for nearly 10 years and i think it was worth the wait honestly. i saw it 11 times in theaters, and i'll probably watch it another 11 more times a week once this releases. while it's not a PERFECT film, it's a GREAT one with PERFECT aspects in it. and i think both seasoned and new Godzilla fans will love it!",1410134400,3,3489,4.335375191424196
5955313,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Great Godzilla movie, though i wish there was a little more monster and a little less Aaron Taylor-Johnson.",1410134400,2,107,5.0
5955314,3,B00EXPOCXY,"It is extremely interesting how this movie has been almost like a Rorschach test for movie goers - particularly the 'hardcore' G fans.  As a popcorn chomper, shut-off your brain experience for the average movie goer it was fine.  The die-hard G fans, however, were at best left saying, 'well...it was a helluva lot better than the 98' version.'  I can't help but see this as a movie that tried to be all things to everyone and just came up short on all fronts and yet, given the plot, if it had dedicated itself to more to one sub-group or another it actually would have been much worse!

Pros: Godzilla's visualization and presentation(Godzilla's indifference to humanity.)  Bryan Cranston's BRIEF appearance. The Big G's Ghost Pepper Throat bomb into the female Muto.

Cons: The plot -  Everyone becomes the world's best screenwriter after a movie is released BUT...it was disappointing that they didn't go down a path whereby perhaps Cranston's wife and child dies as a result of the incident in Japan and then have events transpire that put him in some sort of moral dilemma where his actions could directly influence helping or defeating Godzilla? I had no emotional connection to G.I. Joe and his lobotomized wife.",1410134400,5,1220,4.8647342995169085

So much smarter than the 1998 version that while entertaining, was in retrospect really quite silly. The great, original Japanese Gojira from 1954 is also probably the only other one that is even close to this one in story and execution. People complaining that there isn't enough Godzilla don't realize that if it was start to finish Monster fighting it would lose impact as it became repetetive in it's content. The scene during the battle in San Francisco, where you hear the notes played on the piano as an enormous shadow passes across the face of a building is just one reason why I refered to the movie as art. It's one of those movies that, for me anyways, gets better with each viewing.",1410048000,3,803,4.469387755102041

film had visual and dramatic story telling qualities comparable to  Spielberg classics

Instead, ""Godzilla"" is that annoying noise coming from
that idiotic video game your kids are playing in the back
of the house.

anyone who hates on this movie because ""not enough Godzilla"" ""focused too much on the human side"" ""Short fights or not showing any fights at all""doesn't know the fact that the classic Godzilla movies were the same way, Everything built up till the end. teasing us with every moment until the ending where Godzilla is in a gigantic clash against his opponents! Exactly like this movie! If you have a friend or know some one who says ""this movie sucks!"" ""Its Boring, blah blah blah"" DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. Even if your not a big Godzilla fan, give this movie a try. Do not let other peoples opinions effect your view into this movie.

But despite some issues with the plot, and the actual screen time allotted for the Big G, I watched this film from beginning to end with a great big smile on my face. I truly enjoyed myself, and got lost in the moment (s). Just hearing Ken Wantanabe say, ""We call him Gojira"" was practically worth the price of admission for me.

It is hard not to applaud when the King of Monsters lights-up to ignite his adversaries even though that unique trait was a bit delayed in its manifestation in this film. Godzilla eventually seemed genuinely fatigued by the combat with his foes and even passes out--perhaps due to dehydration. Maybe that is because he is a ""baby-boomer"" monster. It is a situation that easily evokes empathy. We are fans of Ken Watanabe and it is interesting to see him in a ""non-Samurai"" role every now and then.",1410048000,,646,4.767857142857143

5955345,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Absolutely god awful movie that's not worth the $20 to own it. The first 20 minutes were captivating as the story centered largely on Bryan Cranston's character (with his consistently stellar acting) and the process of discovering what's going on, but from the moment the creature is revealed, the movie takes a nose dive. With Bryan Cranston out of the storyline, the spotlight falls upon his son, who delivers as imbecilic and dispassionate performance as one could possibly imagine. I'm not sure who this young man is, but he's not remotely leading-man caliber.

For a Godzilla movie, it's also a surprisingly low-action flick. Unfortunately, the 20-30 minute spans in between action sequences mostly deliver boredom, stale dialogue, incoherent subplots and huge doses of inexplicable human stupidity. And when the action does occur, it looks far more like the pre-CGI action figure simulations than the incredible computer generated animation we've grown accustomed to seeing in modern science fiction movies. And then there's the recasting of Godzilla as the sympathetic savior of human kind rather than the penultimate enemy he's supposed to be. Really, need anything more be said?

The biggest complaint I always hear about Godzilla movies is that there is no story line. *blinks* It's a Godzilla movie. There never is a story line other than a city-stomping monster wreaking havoc and saving the world from other city-stomping monsters. I'm an author and even I don't expect a story line from these movies.

That said, this actually does have somewhat of a story line...enough to get us to invest in the characters a little so we care what happens to them. The graphics were done well, I thought. I think I was just excited to see Godzilla in action again more than anything, so I may be a tad biased.

5955384,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I've got to say I was a bit disappointed in this film. I didn't want to be, despite not really being a Godzilla fan I'm always a fan of giant-butt-kicking monsters that can level cities.
I will say that I enjoyed this better than the 1998 effort with Matthew Broderick but at the same time, many of the issues I had with that last effort were shared in this one. Primarily; human-centric stories. I get it, I do. Hollywood wants you to have a portal into the film, heck, even the original films (the earliest of them at any rate) Godzilla was an allegory for the atomic bomb. Where would we be without some kind of link. I'd submit this; you already have a butt-kicking monster the size of a skyscraper, add a kid or an adult who's maybe somehow psychically-linked and then becomes the films ""witness"", adding in a plane-hopping-bomb-expert who's catching rides across the planet didn't strike me as particularly believable in the first place so you're not going to be out any farther in the suspension of disbelief department.
Still, the FX were well done, loved the job they did with the scale just wish there'd been less human and more monster. Still, if you're looking for a film you can sit back and veg out while you're hanging out, I'd say this isn't a terrible film for it. And despite it's flaws, I think the battle scenes were well-done enough to enjoy. Whatever the case, hardcore Godzilla aficionado or casual monster buttwhooping machine fan, it's a film I'd say you'll probably enjoy enough to get through. So, if you're at the end of your movie-list and looking for something to fill the weekend gap before your next big film dream, I'd encourage you to try this. If you've still got some highly anticipated films on your list, skip this one for a bit longer. Hope you have a good time with it!",1409788800,3,1809,4.552147239263804

At it's best this film is great. Beautiful visually. Some great casting with Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Olsen. I think Aaron Taylor-Johnson is fine, but not especially good -- too much looking dead serious all the time (maybe he just wasn't given the opportunity to look otherwise). And there are scenes that are phenomenal. The halo jump that was featured in trailers is outstanding.

There are many references visually and musically to the Japanese classics and several references to other classics of science fiction (like 2001). So a lot of fun for those who can enjoy all that. But otherwise, I can't say.",1409788800,,899,4.8311688311688314

5955419,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Gareth Edwards's reboot of Godzilla is a tough one to review, because while there's a lot to like about this film, there are also some disappointments, which hold it back from being, ""great"".

If you're a Godzilla fan, be prepared to wait, be prepared to be teased and don't expect Godzilla to be the main star...or monster. The other monsters, the MUTO, get more screen-time and when Godzilla appears on screen, most of the time, the movie cuts away from him and the action. Sure, there's some epic moments with him, towards the end of the film, but there really isn't too much screen-time of him. Not to mention, there's only a few day-time shots, compared to night-time.

I think what Gareth does well, like Spielberg and Peter Jackson, are setup and ""little moments and details"", but unlike them, theres not always a satisfying pay-off.

I mentioned some epic moments towards the end, but honestly, there's a lot of cool moments throughout the film, but it's the teases of monster battles that aren't always seen or focused on, which brings down the suspense and thrill factor.

Having said all that, the special effects of Godzilla and the other creatures is fantastic, however, it is a let-down that most of the battles are at night.

Anyway, this movie is a million times better than that 1998 Zilla film and is also, one of the best Godzilla films, period, but it could've been better...could've been more.

Even with my complaints, this is a fun, rather riveting experience that no Godzilla fan should miss. It has its flaws in the story/script, human characters and lack of Godzilla, but when he's on screen, as well as the other monsters...it's definitely, worth it. And I know fans will be VERY happy to see the TRUE Godzilla in this new American reboot.",1409702400,,1766,4.754901960784314
5955420,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I thought it was a very good action, monster move, I don't understand all the hate, you surely can't be comparing it to the other Godzilla movies, while I understand, I kind of like them as well... but some of them are beyond silly.",1409702400,,232,4.295454545454546
5955421,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I think I can simplify all the reviews down into - if you liked Pacific Rim, I am almost certain you'll like this. Same kind of ""oh, awesome!"" stuff and same kind of mild plot holes you might stick your finger through, but can overlook easily enough and just enjoy.

It was pretty damn awesome - epic scale and man... true to Godzilla, you just root for him to do what he does best.

Not 5 stars only because of some of the plot holes near end that I thought could have been revised or written out relatively easily but weren't -- they weren't gaping holes, but just like Pacific Rim, you spot them and go ""ahhh damnit, common guys, write that stuff out or explain it a different way cause this is sort of silly.""

5955424,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Yes, this was a great Godzilla movie.  Far better even than the other recently released movie.  So why the 4*s?  Predictability.  This Godzilla movie is so much like any other the only thing not predictable was that there was an aircraft carrier with the hull number of 88.  (They haven't quite reached that figure just yet.)

Using my big screen (to me) television and the Vizio sound bar and subwoofer, this flick was incredible!  Not since Das Boat has the sound bar had such a with out.  I was thrilled with the audio.  Also, this was one of those odd occasions that the television audio matched perfectly with the sound bar instead of having an echo or reverb effect.

5955427,5,B00EXPOCXY,"What can you say except that hollywood  finally got a Godzilla movie right for a change . I have seen all the Godzilla movies out there . I loved watching them on a saturday morning during creature double feature.  With the exception of the Godzilla with his kid Gadzooki , serioulsy those movies were campy and embarassing , but i did watch them as a kid .  there has been a some major Godzilla  flops out there . godzilla 2000 , the mechagodzilla remake, King Kong vs Godzilla and Godzilla 1985 and the giant iguana movie that bears the name but not the nature . Like we would not notice the 5 other classic moives they ripped scenes from . And starring as Fay Wray lets all welcome Ferris Bueller.

So whats needed in a basic Godzilla movie? Well for me its simple . to start with Godzilla.

  Giant prehistoric radioactive monster , with glowing fins and atomic breath and this may seem like a no brainer but ... Godzilla's fricking roar.  I know at least one director that just did not grasp that concept , cough cough Roland Emmerich.

Oh and here's a pretty big point Godzilla can't DIE. He is at once both the hero and bad guy  of the story . A point which i think they got exactly right in this movie. He is bad in a force of nature kinda of way , a necessary evil needed to combat a greater evil .

ok we got that, I was sweating towards the end of the movie waiting for the atomic breath which had been a no show , we all totally cheered. I think they did it on purpose , with so many of us remembering the giant iguana disaster, they were teasing us . At least that was what it felt like .

Ok godzilla needs other monsters to fight against. check ,
Godzilla and monsters wreck stuff duing fight , check .
They even got it right about the ever present ever needed asian Dr explaining to us all the nature of the creatures and Godzilla .

Oh and they had some sort of background story too . But lets face it we all don't care about some guy and his family troubles. We came to see Godzilla. They did manage to combine things at the end . But for my money i'd love to see a little less character development with characters we don't care all that much about .

Seriously they could have had 4 or 5 academy award winning actors playing the roles and you could have asked me at the end who was in the film , and i would have told you with a dreamy look in my eye and a big grin, Godzilla.

BEST Godzilla movie in a long time . Seriously hats off to Gareth Edwards and warner brothers for finally not screwing up a foreign movie concept with the typical hollywood style. Seriously it happens a lot much to the chagrin and disgust of those of us who enjoy the foreign films and shows.",1409616000,,2690,4.154142581888246

5955431,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I was hyped beyond belief for Godzilla. The trailers were so expertly crafted and terrifying. Making it seem like Godzilla was going to cause massive destruction and push human kind to its brink for it's sins against nature. If that had been the movie I had seen, I would be writing a different review.

Instead we have one of the most poorly written pieces of cinematic excrement since Prometheus.  Nothing that happens in this movie makes a lick of sense or even follows its own logic let alone that of screenwriting. First of all, the script DEMANDS conveniences in order to get the ""hero"" into the path of destruction every single step of the way and with all exceptions save for one, he is the lone survivor of any direct attack. Then you have a scientist talking about things he can't possibly know, like Godzilla's methods and intentions. How can't he possibly know? Because he says, out loud, that he has never seen the monster and has been waiting for his return. Uhm....o.k. And how about the military? AKA waiters at an all-you-can-eat nuclear buffet who's sole purpose is transport and lose nukes to a nuke eating monster.

Then you have our hero, the bomb expert. Wanna know how we know he's a bomb expert? Because they TELL you he is several times throughout the movie. It's obviously an important skill for the character with this being a movie and all, but guess what. The only time his bomb ""expertise"" comes in handy, is when he hitches a ride with the military by telling them he's a bomb expert. Nevermind that the Army is transporting nukes without their own bomb expert, they will take this guy at this word and let him come along. THEN, and this is a mild spoiler, when it comes time for him to defuse the bomb, he can't. He is literally the most useless character in all of cinema.

None of this would really matter if the monster fights are good, right? Sure. Except there is exactly one fight. A lot of people make comparisons to this movie and Jaws due to the pacing of the reveal of the monster. It's nonsense. Jaws occupied the screen time with excellent, well-drawn characters and a good plot. Here we have nothing but a useless bomb expert, an omniscient scientist and the Keystone Cops as the army.

Learn from Spielberg in Jurrasic Park; the night scenes were visible, and you knew they were filmed for a night shot. You could see what was going on.

Times have changed and I expected a lot out of this movie.
I was hoping they weren't going to go too summer blockbuster and set up a quick story so the monsters could duke it out for 2 hours. That would have become boring quickly. Luckily, they cast Bryan Cranston, an amazing actor, and really put some time into the story. The A.D.D. crowd may be complaining that they didn't fight long enough, but it's action packed for 3/4 of the movie. And the fact that they took the time to set up the big fight just made it so powerful and climatic when it finally happens.
One part I didn't love is the forced love interest and the reuniting with his family storyline. Neither actor seemed particularly charismatic and I'm just bored of the idea that I should care about two people uniting while a catastrophic event is take place. A minor flaw in an otherwise amazing movie.
Overall I can't suggest the movie enough. A great plot, which points out man's arrogance when it comes to controlling nature, and some excellent special effects and fight scenes.",1409616000,,1345,4.516393442622951

The fast paced suspenseful music killed a lot of the scenes. The story telling was a little too fast paced also.

I wish Hollywood would just stop with making the military seem like it's super serious and we're an unstoppable force to be reckoned with...""America's the best! Oorah Master Sergeant!!"" I'm in the military and this was kind of a turn off for me. Nobody talks or acts like this. Corny. Wish I would have waited to rent it. Basically, if you like movies designed for the minds of adolescents like Transformer and Eagle Eye, you'll really like this movie.

The director did a good job, I mean, lets fact it; he has to create a story that people of all ages will tolerate.  I saw a lot of complaints about how little of godzilla was on the screen, but I understand where the director is coming from -- too much godzilla and the movie devolves into pure camp. The plot and script is extremely simple, but it is a monster movie and is supposed to appeal to the 11 year old in all of us.

There really isn't too much exposition that is believable -- this definitely isn't Jurassic Park, but who cares? Saturday night move; sit back and watch it with the kids and you will enjoy yourself.",1409529600,,710,4.205882352941177

What's the point for all the money, effort and time making the CG but can't see it. It's only up to the level as a regular TV movie. As a regular big screen featured film, it won't make much money. As a Gojira movie, it just have the character look like it, but it's not, it should be named ""Human"". It's worse than the 1998 giant lizard movie that at least has more lizard actions that can be seen. It may be an OK movie to someone, but it's not a good one to Gojira fans.

5955481,1,B00EXPOCXY,"As a life long fan, I was looking forward to the arrival of this movie. I have always liked that Godzilla metaphorically represents humankind's nuclear nightmares. I was hopeful that this representation would allow him to return to his wraith of nature bad boy ways, but alias he has been regulated to the position of anti-hero, here to clean up humankind's mess.

The story is very weak, as is most of the acting. The only human character in the film I cared about (Cranston) dies about 20 minutes in and your are left with his son, played by Taylor-Johnson, and honestly he cannot carry the bad script. Watanabe is underused and those scenes he is in are unremarkable. In fact the acting is so bad, I almost felt as though I were watching a spaghetti western from the 60's.

Godzilla has very little screen time and when he does appear I felt no sense of awe of his presence. The CGI is nothing that has not been done before and better by others. The final fight between Godzilla and the MUTO's, who look like Cloverfield's love children, has also been done before.

Of course this iteration is an improvement over the 1998 film with the same name, but just barely. With a more experienced director, a stronger, more imaginative script this film would have soared. As it is, this film has nothing to offer that is new and if you want to see a better Godzilla story I invite you to view the original 1954 film, not this boring, mediocre and unimaginative remaking.",1409529600,12,1465,4.562737642585551

I'm sure they spent a lot of money on cg and sets but the makers of this movie made a huge mistake of forgetting that they needed to make a GODZILLA movie and not every run of the mill scifi movie. For most of the movie, Godzilla takes a back seat for some stupid attempts at character and story building which absolutely doesn't work. Worse of all this movie commits the crime of all badly made scifi  movies - that of building artificial and fake perilous situations with kids as the main focus of the peril. Why they need to do is so asinine, it borders on absolute stupidity. Godzilla is not a monster for kids and the original theme of man's stupidity is all pretty much lost. Humans in Godzilla movies should be like insignificant insects and treated as such. Godzilla is the superior being, physically and mentally and the whole point of that is lost on these insignificant and ignorant makers of this stinker. Finally, the so-called climactic battle scenes at the end takes place at night with dark and murky special effects and visuals.

5955498,2,B00EXPOCXY,"The acting is fine, the special effects are great, the monster is on-screen enough.  The problem with Godzilla is that the script is terrible. Dumb.  Really dumb, insult your intelligence dumb.

A shame, really, because it gets off to a great start, and mimics classic Spielberg down to a T.  The opening plot involving Bryan Cranston is instantly intriguing, and Cranston makes the most of it.  Too bad they don't stick with that. Instead, they drop everything for a by-the-numbers ""lets figure out what it is and kill it"" plot featuring the kid from Kick Ass (seemingly on ludes). About 30 minutes in people start making totally silly (or seemingly random) decisions, and things get dumber from there.  At one point Dr. Serizawa (played by some sleepy fellow you can't understand) says something like, ""Oh, don't worry about that big moth monster jibber-jabber, Godzilla will kick its butt.""

Why does he think that?  Up until that point we know basically nothing about Godzilla, and there's certainly no reason to think it's motivated to fight the moth.  And why does the military have Cranston's son--who ostensibly knows more about what's going on than almost anyone else on earth, thanks to his dad's research--why do they have him toting a rifle as part of some advance attack team?  Wouldn't he be INFINITELY more useful up in the command center telling them what he learned from his pops? Also, the world is under attack by giant mutant monsters--why is our response team being directed by a half-dozen people in a dark room?

These sorts of questions start building up until, at some point around what seemed to be hour 19, you lose all the goodwill created by the movie's first third and your eyes glaze over and you stop caring.  More than once I asked, ""Now what the hell is going on?""  Sure, there's a battle royal near the end that's better than anything in Pacific Rim (not saying much), but it's just so much well-rendered professional wrestling.

Consider this, too:  at no point is the movie scary.  People diss Cloverfield,but that movie is TENSE, and you're constantly worried that the protagonists there are going to get killed.  Here, not once do you believe anyone's really in danger--the monsters look badass, but they're basically doing their own thing independent of humanity.  People are like, oh, hay, there's Godzilla, I hope he wrestles those moths into submission--I'll be over here having a cappuccino while we wait for that to happen.

At bottom, I give them props for trying.  They wanted to make a ""real"" movie out of Godzilla. The tried to get us invested in the characters, they moved slow like in Jaws or Close Encounters and worked to make the reveal more than just more eye candy.  But the foregone conclusion of the ending drives everything that comes before, whether it makes sense or not.  And sure, if you're one of those ""but it looks great!"" people, you'll love it.  But if you're like me and you were hoping for something more, get ready to be disappointed.",1409443200,9,3005,4.803501945525292

How do you completely mess up a Godzilla move? How is that even possible?

Greatest movie monster of all time and the film makers did a good job rendering him.

Great Actors. ( They did the best they could )

Great Sets and production values. ( The craftsmen and women did a great job )

The cinematography was poor. This is down to the director requiring night scenes so dark it's hard to see what's going on.

Yet somehow, with the best possible resources the film makers managed to blow it. The failure is in the script. The human characters needed to present the story and thanks to the script writers this was poorly done and several aspects of it made no sense.

The clearest example of this is the fact that this is supposed to be a film about Godzilla, you know, the headline guy, not some unnamed bug-bat looking thing. ( did they name it? I missed that if they did )  Yet we don't see our favorite super lizard (if indeed he is a lizard) until close to half way through the movie.

Prior to viewing,  ""Godzilla"" actually conjured up stereotypical clich images of an un-intentionally funny, B-movie. Well, the clich characters still remained. But, the ""funny"" became ""fun.""

Pros: Cinematography. This had some stunning visuals with a mixture of beautiful internal locales to dark, ominous and dreary scenes of desolation. The CGI was fantastic. The catastrophic scenes were some of the best to date. Godzilla and the Muto's were strikingly impressive.

Cons: I found it difficult connecting to the characters, esp. Lt, Ford Brody. He seemed so one dimensional. The cast consisted of notable talents Bryan Cranston , Elizabeth Olsen, David Strathairn & Wantanabe. Yet, seemingly they never are given a chance to develop character-wise.

Overall, the direction, pace and most importantly the creatures themselves outweighed any shortcomings of character developments. Some complain Godzilla isn't given enough screen time. I can understand their point, because when Godzilla finally emerges into battle, it's nothing short of spectacular. IMO, Godzilla becomes almost ""majestic.""  Best ""monster"" movie I've seen in years. Enjoyed it tremendously.",1409356800,,1276,5.7967914438502675
5955534,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I can't believe how bad this was. Entire movie tries to generate empathy for Ridiculously Photogenic Soldier who Just Happens to be a Bomb Disarming Expert who is now a Bomb Arming Expert, and his Ridiculously Photogenic Nurse-Wife.  Don't care.  Don't care.  Don't care.  Huge mistake.  Cities being destroyed, thousands if not millions dying, and I'm supposed to care about Jarhead McGee and his gorgeous wifey?  Don't think so.  They should have made it a Cast of Thousands-type thing to show how many people were affected.  One Lone Hero Who You Know Is Going To Survive?  Don't care.

Plus the movie mainly happens at night, because it takes less computing CGI power to render scenes that are mostly dark, I guess.  And to try to keep it consistent, they made even the daytime scenes seem dark.  Monsters are dark.  Mothra and ms. Mothra are black-on-black.  And yes, I thought that Godzilla got not NEARLY enough screen-time.

Couldn't even really finish watching it, it was so bad.  Ended up fast forwarding through the last 1/3 because it was pissing me off how cheesy/tacky it was with all their focus on Handsome Couple.

5955535,5,B00EXPOCXY,"When I heard Gareth Edwards was chosen to direct the new Godzilla movie I wasn't sure what to think about that. I tried once to watch ""Monsters"" but I couldn't get through it. I didn't care for it and really thought the new Godzilla film would be terrible. I was a Godzilla fan since I was a kid and I am 48 now. I would watch the 4:30 movie on weekdays after I got home from school. Lots of science fiction and monster movies including Gamera and Godzilla. Unlike many I enjoyed the 1998 Godzilla. I appreciated it as a monster movie with a monster that wasn't really Godzilla but something close. When the trailers began to come out for this new Godzilla it got my attention. Could Gareth Edwards really have made a good Godzilla film? When me and my Wife saw it the first time, yes we saw it more than once, I wasn't sure how much I liked it. Several things stood out about it that caused me to have to see it once more. For one thing I am a serious amateur photographer. I love camera angles especially if you can create a dramatic effect in a photo using a different angle than might seem normal. Gareth Edwards caught some brilliant angles in the movie. His use of slow motion was great and appropriate where it counted. One of my favorite scenes was the view from inside the school bus on the bridge looking out at Godzilla. It was a chilling perspective. Another scene was the view from inside the airport with Godzilla's foot and the explosions. Very well done. The Muto could have come across as silly but they were well done and very creepy. The look and the atmospheric feel of the film was very good. Like many, I would have liked to have seen a little more Godzilla action. But me thinks it was very expensive every time he was on screen and there were budget concerns. There was a movie called ""Escape from New York"" by John Carpenter which did a lot with a small budget. If you happened to listen to the commentary track by John Carpenter and Kurt Russel, a great commentary by the way, you would have heard John comment on working with a small budget. He made a great point that having less to work with on Escape, forced everyone to be more creative as in the scene where Snake Pliskin approaches New York in the glider. The computer rendering of the city as seen on the gliders monitor was just a model made up of cardboard buildings with luminescent green paint as outlines. My point here is that Gareth did a great job with what was available. If there was more Godzilla and action by him then certainly the movie could have cost a lot more. It was a gamble anyway. Could a expensive Godzilla movie draw in an American audience today? Sure if it's done right. And I think this one was done right. It gives me hope that a second one can also be as good.",1409356800,,2773,4.324376199616123
5955536,5,B00EXPOCXY,"They did EVERYTHING RIGHT!!! ...5 stars is never given by this writer. Why now? in a nutshell, anyone who's going to watch a movie called GODZILLA is expecting a CGI ridden nightmare of innocuous banter and goofy storyline we just want some good battles! Well, kinda like that. But they didn't cut what was necessary to build up to the inevitable battle with a good understanding of what was going on and character development that didn't seem contrived or obligatory. I bet there's 30 MORE minutes of this movie, just as good, on the editing room floor but they had to stop somewhere

The topper is this seems to be the remake that will spark a couple of sequels  and trust me, there WILL be a demand for them as long as you keep the production team intact and don't touch a thing!

Where's Godzilla? After all these years we finally see the legend reappear and you missed it! Pity for you - I got a GREAT View !

For some reason I had high hopes and actually purchased this film for streaming via Instant Video instead of just renting it. But I also could hear a tiny, far-away, nagging voice that kept crying over-and-over again: ""Don't do it!"".

The far-away voice, as usual, hit the nail squarely on the head and I should have listened to it.

The opposite thing happened recently with ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"". I couldn't imagine a movie that included a 7' tall man-plant and a super-angry, bio-engineered raccoon being anything but a joke and a total box office flop, but the far-away voice said: ""Go see it...it's gonna be awesome!"". In that case I listened, and man, I'm glad I did!

5955541,2,B00EXPOCXY,"This movie was all over the place. I loved Edwards first movie Monsters and was very excited when I heard he'd be directing Godzilla, but this movie was pretty bad. Edwards does a good job directing the action sequences, but everything else was absolutely terrible. The acting outside of Cranston was horrific, with the exception of Olsen, but it doesn't matter because her character was pretty much pointless. I have to hand it to her she really tried to sell everything and gave it her all, but at the end of the day it only made her seem like she was overacting as the rest of the cast seemed to be speaking their lines like they were on a soap opera.

It's not just the acting that was bad. Maybe if there was some better writing the actors wouldn't have came off so bad, but there wasn't and as a result they delivered on painfully cliche line after the other with some of the smaller characters sounding like they're reading off a prompter. The actual plot itself made no sense, which wouldn't matter if the movie was fun enough to pull it off and just have you turn off your brain and enjoy, but it wasn't because the tone of the movie ""tried"" to be dark and realistic, which goes against the ridiculous acting. Edwards again fails here and he cant seem to figure out what he's trying to do. Make a fun summer popcorn flick, or a seriously ""realistic"" take on Godzilla. I put realistic and quotations because hey how realistic can a movie about a giant prehistoric creatures coming to life and reigning havoc over the the world be. That's just it, maybe if they had gone a more fun route like Pacific Rim you could excuse the s***ty writing, directing, and acting, but they didn't and instead ended up with a mixed up movie that didn't know what it was trying to be.",1409270400,2,1773,4.438650306748467

The scenes of cities being ripped apart look perfect.  The monsters look perfect, and Godzilla in particular is amazingly detailed.  Bryan Cranston acts manic and crazy early in the movie which Breaking Bad fans will appreciate.  Besides that, the human characters are easily forgettable.

5955593,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla 2014 just hit streaming, Directed by Gareth Edwards, the film marked the return of Godzilla to the big screen in wide release for the first time since the Roland Emmerich abomination back in 1999. So far it is a huge box-office hit and the reviews have been generally good, with the majority liking the film and a smaller minority being indifferent to not liking it. This will be my take on the film. I plan to go from what the film does right to what it does wrong (and there are some things it does do wrong), and then to a conclusion. I hope you enjoy this.

Right thing #1: The Tone

The first thing the film does right I want to point up is setting and keeping Tone. Tone for the uninitiated is the ""mood"" of a movie, or how it feels. For examples of films that do a very poor job on Tone, look at the Transformers movies, the Star Wars prequels and Man of Steel. All of these films have abrupt tonal shifts from drama to screwball comedy to pseudo horror and others that occur frequently enough to leave the viewer with no real emotional ""sense"" of the film.

Godzilla, on the other hand, does a brilliant job of setting and holding a foreboding, somewhat ominous tone. This stems from things like scenery selection, subtle bits of acting from Bryan Cranston, the utter helplessness of the defending military and the way destruction is shown - with scenes of the dead and the injured straining medical help past the breaking point. Even the way some of the monster battles are shot lends to this tone as the people are basically insects caught in the middle of a titanic struggle.

Right thing #2: The return of buildup and payoff

Something I have really missed in recent films is the concept of buildup and payoff. In general terms, this is where a particular scene or sequence is actually the payoff to earlier scenes and sequences that built up to it. Recent films have been much more about showing it all almost right away and basically being a soulless CGI orgy thereafter. The notable exception to this rule was Pacific Rim which also seemed to ""get"" this concept.

In Godzilla, Edwards does buildup and payoff better than we have seen on the big screen since Spielberg was making good films (like Raiders of the Lost Ark which also was great at buildup and payoff). The MUTOs were an excellent example of this but the best was the buildup to Godzilla himself coming on the scene. It added a sense of anticipation that aided in the tone setting mentioned already.

Right Thing #3: Godzilla himself

After the horrid GINO ignuana of Emmerich's garbage, Kaiju fans were rightly ambivalent about letting another American director at Godzilla. Gareth Edwards, however, is a long time avid fan of Godzilla and Kaiju films. The film that put him on the map was a Kaiju film (Monsters) he made himself on his laptop. His complete lack of experience in big productions was a concern, and to be honest it did manifest itself in other less good ways. However, here it was a benefit.

To be blunt, his Godzilla is faithful to the Toho character. He is BIG, mean, a total boss and really felt like what Ishiro Honda would have made had he had access to modern technology. The nuclear fire breath was extremely well done also, and the roar was amazing in the theater. And the movements and actions were totally Godzilla also.

This love of Kaiju films extended to the rest of the film as well. It is structured like a lot of Toho films, and the big surprise reveal (yes the trailers were recut to give the wrong impression - Godzilla is the hero not the villain) was also pure Toho.

Okay.

Remember I mentioned Gareth Edwards lack of experience in making big films? Here's where the OTHER side of that coin comes into play:

Wrong thing #1: Pacing

Simply put, a big studio film like this needs a quicker, more even pace. Godzilla felt a bit like a small studio film where the pacing in act 2 was too slow. Ironically, Monsters had the exact same issue. This had the side effect of making Godzilla himself feel like he was on even less than he actually was (the 20 minute figure bandied about is off - he was definitely on longer. Really the film could have been about 15 minutes shorter and lost nothing simply by trimming act 2.

Wrong thing #2: Acting outside of Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe

When one actor is flat, I generally lay it on the actor. When more than one is not only flat but the same kind of flat, I look at the director. Cranston and Watanabe did well in their roles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen were both very muted and dull. Again, go back and watch Monsters and you see the same thing with the human characters - a couple standouts and the rest are kind of human paste in the background.

Conclusion

Sorry this was so long.

Overall, I like this film. Godzilla felt perfect in it and I could forgive the pacing and flattish characters in light of the brilliant work in tone, buildup, payoff and ""money scenes"". I even enjoyed the couple of Easter eggs in the film for the avid Toho buffs. While it has a couple of issues they are the marks of an inexperienced director, and I do not expect him to repeat them. I also expect there will be a totally different cast in the sequel, as that is the custom in Godzilla films and the whole ethos of this film was honoring the Godzilla movie.",1409270400,2,5332,4.478350515463918

5955601,5,B00EXPOCXY,"People's complaints about this don't seem valid to me. The head of TOHO Studios, where Big G was born, told the director after the premiere that this film was everything that it should be. The flow of it is very much like the older, beloved classics. Only a few of those had wads of monster time in them, either, aside from a few like ""Destroy All Monsters."" You need to keep in mind that the human setup is largely about their shock at being attacked by giant monsters, hence no one is explored in depth, but there's no need for it, either. You don't need a lot of exposition to understand why Cranston does as he does; he has a pro-active form of PTSD. You get gradually larger doses of monster action and the final fight is impressive. Giant monster movies are half about the monster and half about the shock of facing one (or more). I saw this in the theater for the big sound system kaboom you can't get at home. Taken flat-footed and fairly, this is a GOOD summer popcorn flick. All but very small kids can watch it, too, an added plus for bored dads who are ready to serve The Little Mermaid on a bun after 700 replays. Its a very good GODZILLA movie and taken as it is, it deserves an A for sticking to Toho pacing form and for sheer style. Well worth at least one solid viewing and I'm going for one more to pick up a few details. Its a fair WIN.

5955611,5,B00EXPOCXY,"To all of those who think there is not enough Godzilla, shame on you. Go back to watch the Showa Era Godzilla movies and come back to see this one. It retains a lot of what Godzilla is all about: a monster that constantly reminds us of our recent actions regarding weapons of mass destruction. Just like in the first movies, Godzilla is depicted as a monster/event that just happens to destroy human settlements because ""we are on its way"" between it and whatever it wants. You could compare it to a hurricane/typhoon or to a massive earthquake: you don't see that every single day until it happens. Then, you just wait until it stops.

This movie is just what the original Kaiju movies tried to convey on us: our insignificance compared to the wrath of mother nature itself. First of all, a cheesy acting and subplot accentuates what I just said on the previous sentence. Yes, they could have done better regarding Serizawa, Monarch, the Fords (including Joe's overall participation on the movie), and Japanese talent. Instead of saying 'Where is Godzilla?' you should all be asking yourselves 'Where is Japan in all of this? Janjira and Serizawa? Give me a break...'. It just shows how biased people are concerning the monster's origins. They care more about monster screen time than the overarching story itself or its significance. The film's pacing is just right for this type of film: not too fast for the horrors to stop delivering their effect on the public and not too slow to keep up with the American film industry's aesthetics (grimacing at Hollywood).

Moving on to the details, I believe the United States of America's latest version of Gojira nails it. The amount of CGI used to depict the monsters is astounding and it is used to the fullest during the fighting and chasing sequences. Though, I would have liked to see the monsters' wounds to give it even more realism. The use of dark settings and only showing parts of the monsters pays homage to Japanese horror movies, which is the category where the original Gojira was placed and where Gojira movies should always remain in. Gojira's ""signature roar"" sounds great, but it lacks the high-pitch segment that all Gojiras have when they peak out during their roars. I am not saying it is a bad roar. However, when you compare it back-to-back, it doesn't even remotely sound like the original. Instead, they extended the low roar and its ""pull"" to make it sound as if it is actually coming from a 355ft tall creature, which is a 4 out of 5 by my standards as a die-hard Gojira fan.

The King of the Monsters itself is unbelievably that good aesthetically and it is extremely interesting during the combat sequences. This monster pulls off something never seen from the likes of it right before the end of the movie, sealing the grand finale with its iconic roar and giving me the goosebumps I had during Gojira's appearances in 1954 and from The Return of Godzilla on 1984. I can recognize that the film's gruesomeness has been toned down for children to enjoy it. But, Oh My Gojira, what is that thing I am watching on the screen? Every single time this force of nature appears, it seems to pop out of it. It was not meant to be liked at all. I repeat, it was not meant to be liked at all. Gojira's combination of Tortoise/Bear/Eagle/Komodo Dragon/Elephant/Whale constituent parts will overthrow your mind once it is on-screen. It was ingeniously conceived to remain as close to its origins as possible while giving it the look and feel of an animal/otherworldly deity that just came out of the depths of the sea, a la C'thulu.

This movie borrows a lot from many Kaiju movies like Cloverfield, TriStar's Godzilla (1998), and the Godzilla series itself. Do not expect that much of a ""good acting"" overall, because this movie aims to bring the true fans back to the good side of the american film industry, regarding the Kaiju film production. Of the many things it lacked were the Japanese typical feel from Toho. Adding a brief Japanese setting and a couple of swift Japanese characters does not deliver that well when you are actually using a Japanese trademarked monster with a long history of living side-by-side with the Japanese. So, please, Legendary Pictures, add more Japanese actors and more Japanese participation to your cast next time you decide to use Japanese merchandising. There are so many good Japanese actors in the film industry (looking at Toho) besides Mr. Watanabe, which can add even more depth to the stories being told. If what you are trying to do is to make it global, there is your lead. We need more cooperation between Legendary Pictures and Toho  as well as making stars actually shine on film in order to make it work. It may sound contradictory, but if Toho could do it for 56 years with its very diverse cast, anyone with a good sense of screen writing and competent storytelling can do it regardless of how much money is employed on production.

I give it a 4.55 out of 5. It is a really good film overall and it may be seen as a milestone 20 years from now. The HD version does not seem that different from watching it on a 480p screen. Maybe it is the player or something...

P.S.:The MUTOs were created to complement this monstrosity and they have as much screen time as Gojira. I believe they fill the roles RADON, and ZILLA had in the series.",1409097600,6,5352,4.6571428571428575

5955615,3,B00EXPOCXY,"As George Takei might say, ""OH MY!""  This movie has a lot of problems, but its effects are incredible.  Its acting is incredible.  Godzilla and his foes are fun to watch, though we barely get to see them.

You've got to write really well in order to pull something of this magnitude off.  Unfortunately, there are just too many holes in this plot, too many unanswered questions, and too many ridiculous reactions.  The beginning of the movie is very entertaining--it seems like it is building to unravel some terrible mystery.  Then it fizzles out.  The middle of the movie is just a big waiting game--where are the monsters?  The end of the movie is the best, because Godzilla shows up to kick some moth-booty AND the main character we are now following finally has something to do.

Here are a few annoyances you get with the price of admission:

1) What are these monsters?  Why are they here?  Where have they been?  Any historical or mythological bases for these monsters?  You'd think a movie like this would tantalize you and answer those questions.  Nope.

2) Why is Godzilla the good guy?  He just is.  Why does the population of the world love a giant monster?  They just do.  Let's get real!!!  The USA alone would be nuking Godzilla in the face until God decided enough was enough.  Nobody in their right mind would gleefully accept a monster the size of a skyscraper lurking around the planet.

3) Why don't they try to communicate with Godzilla?  Maybe give us some understanding of how they magically know that he is ""good"" ?

4) If the USA could not get water to Katrina victims, how am I supposed to believe that giant monster attacks are under control!?!  Full medical coverage!?!  Relocation and re-unification of families!?!  A big screen TV in the stadium for the people!?!  Are you NUTS!?!  How unbelievable can you get?

5) Giant monsters who don't eat?  Stop.  Just stop.

6) Giant monsters with EMP powers?  Why?  We just have to accept it.

7) BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL: Why is Godzilla a monster killer?  Nature will balance itself out?  Really?  THAT'S why?  Is he humanity's protector?  Or just some bouncer from the Ocean?  No idea.

8) There are opportunities for the main character and the soldiers with him to get all Starship Troopers and kill monster babies.  But . . . nope.  You can look, but no touchy-touchy.  We wouldn't want to make a largely boring movie explode with action, would we?

YIKES!  The only thing this movie has going for it is its giant monsters.  And they do not star in this film.  They pick up the slack in the end and make us partially-glad we paid for the movie.

DO NOT BUY.  It's just not worth it.  :(  What a shame.  But it is worth a rental.  I think.  If you fast forward a lot.",1409097600,2,2743,4.5246913580246915
5955616,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I really wanted to like this movie. At best it's okay.....I should have waited to rent instead of buying. To give you an idea, Battleship and Pacific Rim were both better than this movie.

Not a fan of the shaking camera...drives me nuts. It's not realistic, it's just irritating. I don't think it was shot on film, could be wrong, but it's one of those movies where you wish they had used film.

Like other reviewers have said: a lot of the scenes don't have much lighting...so turn off the lights while watching. The props looked cheap and the sets sort of sucked, maybe that's why it was so dark in most of the scenes, maybe they spent all their money on Cranston and the CGI. Unfortunately there's not much cool CGI 'cause you don't see the monsters that much, and Cranston's part is pretty small.

Acting is mediocre at best from the actors who have most of the screen time or maybe it's the story or directing, maybe a combination. Cranston doesn't have much screen time and neither does Ken Wantanabe...two best actors in the movie. There's too much what seems to be filler, there's not really much of a story so the ""filler"" just weighs down the whole movie.

A little better story, acting, set design, and directing and this is a great movie....You cut that filler out and replace it with Godzilla squishing people and it's a way better movie.

Godzilla does kick some butt at the end, I wanted to see more though. I'm watching Godzilla....I want to see him reaping massive amounts of destruction and stomping on people.

I saw a lot of the old Godzilla movies growing up, most of them anyhow, as well as the one in the 90's (90's right?). Let's face it, those old movies weren't exactly high production value or great acting....but it did make them sort of funny to watch. The old movies had more Godzilla in them and longer fight/destruction scenes too. It's like they took the worst stuff from the old movies and gave it a bigger role while taking the good stuff, Godzilla reaping chaos and destruction while stomping on people, and gave it a smaller role.

Whether you are a fan of the Shwa series, Heisei series or Millennium Series there is definitely something in this movie for you.  I cant say too much more without spoilers.

On the other hand if you have never seen a classic Japanese Godzilla movie then this likely isn't for you.  Like it's predecessors the story focuses on the human characters and the philosophical question of how much control does man have over nature.  While there are some great monster on monster brawls if you strap yourself in for that reason alone you will be greatly disappointed.

So most of this film is not really worth watching because you can't really see a thing other than moving blobs and flashes of light. Why was this misguided lighting decision made? Deep murky darkness adds nothing to the plot other than to make it less believable. I guess giant lizards and other monsters only come out to fight in total darkness because they don't want to be seen? What a shame. It was almost completely visually unappealing to me.

5955629,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Not a perfect Godzilla movie but a huge step in the right direction. I've been a Godzilla fan since I was 4, starting with Godzilla vs. Hedorah and Godzilla 1985. I was just 12 when I saw Emmerich's take on Godzilla and I left the theater very disappointed. That did not happen with this Godzilla at all. I saw it in theaters, catching an early I-Max and I nearly cheered with audience during several key Godzilla moments. I did exclaim 'yes' when we all saw a very familiar blue glow shining across the screen.

What I liked about this is that while it is different from the numerous takes on Godzilla there is still enough of Godzilla to see that this is clearly Godzilla. Emmerich's Godzilla is just a giant T-Rex with a few spines added to it and lacks durability or a breathe weapon and Zilla was just a mess to 12 year old me and still a mess. Zilla Jr. in the cartoon I have no beef with and I think Godzilla the Series does great justice to the Godzilla mythos. There are things in this move we don't usually see in Godzilla movies, only a handful demonstrate how many people are hurt or killed when a giant monster destroys a city or just how many people are refuges in their home cities or towns. And Godzilla's breathe weapon is given a great sense of gravity as it is used much less and gets great build up and is quite possibly the weakest yet. That is my ideal Godzilla: mostly melee and using his breathe attack every once in a while

Human characters: er yeah, they're passable. They are the reason why this movie isn't getting five stars. Sadly Brian Cranston is not the main character and is really only in the first act, Ken Watanabe as Dr. Serizawa with Sally Hawkins as Dr. Graham feel a bit wasted. If people wonder what I consider an utter failure as a protagonist look no further than Shia Lebouf as the depressingly annoying Sam Witwicky from the first three Transformers films.

The film feels like an older film, they saved all the huge fight for the end and I love that. People that love Pacific Rim bash people who love this Godzilla and vice versa but I love both films dearly, they are like polar opposite siblings, one calculating and quite the other hot blooded and loud.

5955630,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Okay film in general but terrible Godzilla move... buy the Criterion 1954 original Godzilla instead, the best part of this film was the first 10 min with the mother and father at the nuclear power plant - then it's ALL downhill from there... doesn't even look like Godzilla...
Sure, the effects were great but who cares? All big budget summer blockbuster films LOOK great now... No heart, and more importantly very very very little Godzilla at the end...
Godzilla had no personality, and every single time I thought we were going to see a fight suddenly the scene changed and we get - you guessed it Aaron Taylor Johnson doing his G.I. Joe impersonation or Elizabeth Olsen running around - lots of stupid choices too... if you were on leave from the military and you had a wife and young son why the hell would you stick around and play hero? It doesn't make ANY sense, you would go straight for your family and get them the hell out of there and find out wherever Godzilla and the monsters were going then head for the opposite side of the planet... the father and mother were the more interesting characters but the mother dies 10 min in and the father dies 30 min in... then it becomes the ""Army Guy movie"" as we follow Aaron Taylor Johnson around for 2 hours and only see glimpses of Godzilla 'til the disappointing end - this movie was never made for longtime Godzilla fans who grew up with the character - this film is for younger audience who really don't know any better... TRUST ME - the older films are more fun and make a whole LOT more sense!!!!
The original 1954 Japanese film is still and ALWAYS WILL BE the best Godzilla, it's thought provoking, classy, character driven, mysterious AND you get more Godzilla too... It simply is wonderful and I would watch the original Japanese film a 1000 times before watching Godzilla 2014 twice... So PLEASE go buy the 1954 original Japanese version on Criterion Blu-ray instead of this.
I mean seriously - if you want to see a classic film updated and done right compare the 1933 King Kong to the Peter Jackson version - both are superb and Godzilla 2014 isn't anywhere within a billion miles of the same league as the Jackson King Kong. Not even in the same galaxy... I was completely bored out of my mind for 2 hours watching this film and never once felt like I was actually watching a Godzilla movie except at the very very beginning ... but after the initial power plant scene I was waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen, anything to happen... but nothing ever did... finally it ended and I clapped not because it was a good movie but because I was so grateful that it was FINALLY over....",1409011200,,2666,4.521739130434782

5955633,3,B00EXPOCXY,"There is a line of dialogue spoken in the last half of this year's GODZILLA that encapsulates the film so well it must be cosmic karma. The line is spoken by David Strathairn, who grimly inquires of his aides, ""Where is Godzilla?"". This sums up perfectly the flaws of Gareth Edwards' otherwise rather breath-taking monster movie. The movie is _called_ Godzilla. The trailers _showed_ Godzilla. We came to _see_ Godzilla. So where in the heck IS Godzilla? So, before we embark on my review on Godzilla, let me remind you that this is just my subjective opinion on the movie, and I'll try not to lose you, because this could get really deep.

First off, the saddest part is that Godzilla could have been so much greater. The trailers certainly showed us the potential (Godzilla, in my opinion, had one of the best marketing campaigns in recent memory). Here was a chance to make a movie that was epic, awe-inspiring and fast-paced, packed with action, humor and the kind of insanity you'd expect from a movie about a 400-foot monster with radioactive breath, fighting other monsters that look like the lovechild of H.R. Giger, a cobra and a butterfly. Instead we get a long movie (that feels much longer) saturated with a thick sense of doom, a convoluted plot that moves at a glacial pace, a collection of dour performances, a sprinkle of jaw-dropping fight scenes and apocalyptic imagery, and a little something thrown in on the side about...scientific hubris? nature out of whack? And all the while things are missing: a sense of fun and adventure, action, and namely, Godzilla.

Let's start with the plot. The way I remember it, GODZILLA is about these evil, flying MUTO's that Godzilla has to fight. Everything else, from the romantic subplot to the military subplot, to the symbolism to the setting to the ridiculous leaps of the imagination that are asked of the viewers is utterly secondary. The film moves at the pace of a lumbering behemoth, as characters go places, talk about things, and make you wonder why they're in the film at all. On the side, there is some action thrown in there. And you'll be happy when it comes, because it is utterly awesome, in the truest sense of the word. More on that later.

Let's talk a little about the acting. Consider last year's monster movie: Pacific Rim. A sincere and often goofy ode to kaiju, in every frame of the movie, every actor and every crewman is having fun. Characters have names like Hannibal Chau and Newton Geiszler. Godzilla has characters with names like Joe Brody and Ford Brody. Everybody plays their roles with grim faces and serious intonations. The only one having fun is Bryan Cranston, who chews the scenery with relish and gets all the best lines. The humans are utterly secondary to the monsters, and some of them have little to no impact on the plot at all. I'm certain there's at least one scientist or soldier who did zilch to advance the plot.

Now, I'm perfectly happy to not see the monster for a while, a la Jaws. We don't fully see the T-Rex or King Kong until almost 45 minutes into their movies, and we feel satisfied. But it works because in the meantime we're spending time with interesting and cool human characters like Alan Grant and Carl Denham. In Godzilla, talented actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn play cookie-cutter, thick, white bread characters that interest nobody. You'll be aching to see more than the monster equivalent of a little ankle. But maybe all of this works out in the end. Because when Godzilla goes the full monty, we are so pumped.

And that's where Godzilla gets good. That's why you should see the movie. Because when director Gareth Edwards finally gets room to gallop, he freaking gallops. The man has an eye for a stunning image, and he scatters the movie with the kind of jaw-dropping, terrifying, beautiful imagery you expected from the trailer. An abandoned city, given over to nature; a giant kaiju wreathed in smoke; trails of red smoke over a fiery San Francisco, the sheer bulk and might of Godzilla unleashed in the moonlight...these are images that will stay with me. Speaking of our titular character, when he DOES show up, he's unbelievably impressive. Edwards and the visual effects department have conjured up what might just be the best-looking Godzilla yet. They've captured a creature of immense bulk and weight and size, a force of nature...an ""alpha predator"" that makes the might of Uncle Sam's war machine look like ants carrying little sticks. His foes - the MUTO's, look equally impressive: a vaguely Giger-esque cross between a butterfly, praying mantis, cobra, and bat. They have glowing red eyes and crooked limbs and they fly like your worst nightmare. When these kaiju fight, they fight! The battle between Godzilla and the MUTO's is a hugely impressive action scene. It has weight and gravitas - this ain't the flashy glitz of Transformers or Marvel - this is big, scary, epic warfare that will leave you in awe. I wish we saw more of Godzilla, and less of...Ford Brody.

In conclusion, Godzilla does have some amazing action scenes and is visually stunning. When Godzilla is on the screen, the movie inspires awe and wonder. When he's off - and unfortunately that's for a major portion of the screentime, the film collapses under the weight of its dense, slow-moving plot, cookie cutter characters, and lack of action. But while Godzilla has its impact lessened, it is by no means a film you should avoid. I recommend the movie as a collection of unforgettable and gorgeous images and action scenes, separated by dense filler. If this Godzilla isn't the King of the Monsters, he's at least an Archduke. Maybe a Count. Or a Prince Regent.
Godzilla, Prince Regent of the Monsters, gets 3 stars from me.

5955635,2,B00EXPOCXY,Not paying $30 for this.  I wish the studios would stop bundling multiple formats into a single package.  Only want one format.  Don't want to pay for the rest.  It's a waste.,1408838400,,175,4.375

5955637,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Action! Celebrities! Great story! Suspense! Monsters! Definitely a Summer hit! I loved this movie! I highly recommend buying or seeing it! I also liked the Matthew Broderick version. I watched the original Japanese version in preparation for this newest one, and that was interesting, cool to compare all 3 versions. This newest one is my favorite though, for a few reasons:
1) Bryan Cranston blew us away with Breaking Bad. It was great to see him back and on the big screen. His acting was phenomenal and really brought drama and suspense to the film. He made it all seem very real and very serious.
2) The monster was great-looking! The CG was superb. He was the perfect size and believable. He was relatable too, you wanted to fear him, but you were also cheering for him. Between the tension and the heart-warming feelings that the film makers were conjuring from the audience, it was an emotional rollercoaster!
3) The film was not too long to bore you, and not too short to leave u wanting more. It had a great, comprehensive story. I left the theater feeling elated and satisfied and I cannot say that about the past few movies I've seen this year.
4) The Skydiving scene was amazing. Period. Gave me chills. I'll leave it at that, hopefully I didn't ""spoiler"" anything.

I usually can't find many movies where I'm like, ""That was freaking great!"" And I wasn't necessarily a fan of Godzilla-related things, but this movie changed all that. I even bought a mini figure of him (""Running Press Godzilla with Light and Sound"" - see my review!), just because it was THAT awesome! So yes, definitely buy, rent...just SEE this movie, it's a must and you will NOT be disappointed!",1408838400,,1680,4.694915254237288
5955638,5,B00EXPOCXY,"This movie is simply breathtaking; it had the right amount of suspense, the right amount of action to keep me entertained throughout. The American audience has poor taste in movies, that's why Godzilla was THE movie of the Summer.",1408838400,,230,4.923076923076923
5955639,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Well, I thought the movie started out pretty strong, but then just went through the motions of a big budget action thriller. Lots of human emotion, but a little overboard on the destruction side of things. Godzilla may be the hero, but he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. Also the main characters were pretty bland and the dialogue (screenplay/script) very thin. Elisabeth Olsen just didn't fit in this film and she is an incredible actress IMO. She needs to move onto bigger and better things. Great special effects here, but not much else. The movie seemed(s) very scatterbrained like many other movies this year. And just had no ""real"" direction, it was just all over the place with about 20 different destinations, twists, and sloppy editing.

I honestly think Hollywood is grasping at straws to come up with new and clever ideas. And 2014 has definitely been one of the worst years that I remember for movies in recent times. So this one is good, but nothing as great as most fans, and critics made out to be. Most of the best films I've seen this year have been movies no one has heard of. Stick to the independent films, that's where the real gems are. And btw, read my headline as another reason the movie is mediocre, totally ruined it for me. Otherwise I would have probably given it a higher rating.",1408665600,3,1316,4.6239316239316235
5955640,5,B00EXPOCXY,"This is the Godzilla film I have longed for since I was a kid! It moves at an old school speed with just enough glimpses of the King to satisfy you.

As a kid I always wondered what was going on in the middle of all the devastation, what are the people doing to survive? This is where Gareth delivers, the characters are scared and doing whatever they can to survive. The music is eerie and serves the action well. The 3D is used well to give scope to the horror of what is happening.

That was a mistake that I believe many Godzilla Fans made as well.  After watching it again at the theater with another kaiju and Godzilla fan, I really enjoyed this movie.  It definitely pays homage to the original.  Sure you had to sit through character development for pretty much the first hour and a half (with a few teases)..but the last 30 minutes...ROCKED...for any Godzilla fan.

while they fire EMP bursts. And like Godzilla they are hundreds of years old.
For some idiotic reason they are one of the bugs is revived and gets out of control, and
communicates with its mate and try to make babies. But Godzilla does not like them and so
the movie is essentially a fight among the monsters, with human cities as their playground.
It is an epic tale of destruction (there is even a tsunami of some kind) and fans of
such films will really like this movie

This certain Godzilla movie was mainly supposed to explain everything story wise. Not much action which I think is why people had so much hate on it. To be honest for all of the Godzillas they have made they had to at least make one where it explained what was going on and I'm pretty sure that most would agree with me.

5955644,5,B00EXPOCXY,"My teenagers and I had a good time at the theatre watching Godzilla strut his stuff. Every summer a bunch of big budget sci fi action movies come out. Usually one, maybe two stand out. In 2009, District 9 surprisingly came out of the blue to give us our best bang for a buck. In 2012 it was Inception. This year we've had X-Men, another Transformers, another Planet of the Apes, another Spiderman and the ridiculous Pacific Rim. As a serious film buff and veteran popcorn consumer I feel that Godzilla is clearly the class of the field this summer, especially if you got to see it in IMAX 3-D. The movie celebrates the Godzilla of old while skillfully giving the monster a fresh look.

Bryan Cranston, fresh off his outstanding work in 'Breaking Bad"" plays a scientist working at a nuclear power plant in Japan. His wife was killed in an accident at the plant a decade earlier. He's convinced that the authorities aren't telling us everything (and when do they ever do that anyway). All this builds up the suspense. Aaron Taylor Johnson, Cranston's now grown son and military officer gets involved. The other actors do a fine job save for the usually outstanding David Strathairn. He seems miscast as the military commander trying to protect us. To me he seemed to still be in his role as the nervous, introverted college administrator from 'We are Marshall.'

The first big action scenes features a MUTO - massive unidentified terrestrial organisms - who has woken from a long sleep and is looking for it's mate. The MUTO's are scary looking creatures long buried and looking to feed on whatever radioactivity we've left lying around. I won't tell you which cities get wrecked. Suffice it to say that Tokyo is spared this time as the creatures move West. I've heard and read the criticism that we see too little of Godzilla and too late. I don't agree. Seeing the way they build up the suspense, get you interested I didn't see that as a problem. In one outstanding scene without Godzilla you'll see one of the MUTOs break free of puny humans attempts to restrain it. And there is plenty of action with Godzilla especially the epic battle at the end.",1408492800,2,2151,4.6430446194225725
5955645,5,B00EXPOCXY,"This was an excellent reintroduction of the Godzilla character, and an excellent movie in general. It was definitely a lot different compared to what I was expecting. That's for sure. But, in my opinion, the movie that we got (with Godzilla as the semi-heroic monster battling against the antagonistic M.U.T.O.'s) is preferable to the movie I had predicted (with an antagonistic Godzilla wrecking things all the way through the movie). This is my new favorite incarnation of Godzilla: a dark guardian protecting the balance of nature, no matter the cost. The special effects are fantastic. The acting is good. The story is great. I have been a Godzilla fan for years, and this is all that I could ask for from a Godzilla.

They brought in new monsters, now I'm not aware that Godzilla's enemies in this film have appeared in other movies but still a good add-in.

5955648,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla is not a big bad lizard running wild in New York City. Hollywood studios seem to have finally understood that. With the right director Gareth Edwards (of Monsters fame), Godzilla (or Gojira, to be precise) is back. Indeed, the story is full of plot holes and characters are flat, but the 2014 version of Godzilla is an entertaining action movie while, like Pacific Rim, paying respect to the genre that inspired the film.

The new Godzilla film starts with two nuke-related events in the Pacific Ocean and Japan. It takes some time for the monster to appear on the screen, but be patient. About human characters, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is an American explosive disposal officer, whose father (played by Bryan Cranston) has been obsessed with a conspiracy theory about the accident ten years ago.

To me, the most impressive part of the film is its visuals that cleverly employ humans POVs in emphasizing the hugeness of the creatures, and the new sound design of Godzilla's roar. Veteran players including Bryan Cranston and David Strathairn are effective, though characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are rather weak.

You may say the film does not show the titular monster long enough. You are right, and thats exactly the point. I also know some complain about the story that is often impossible. Yes, I understand. (How come Dr. Serizawa played by Ken Watanabe know the name of the monster in the first place?) The fact is, the new Godzilla is only following the B-movie conventions of the kaiju genre back in the 1950-60s.

Dont look for subtlety or complexity here. The film looks dark and contains some social messages, but Godzilla is primarily a good, old-fashioned monster flick revamped for the new millennium.",1408233600,,1745,4.986254295532646
5955649,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Looking at these reviews, I can see this film wasn't for everyone. I guess it's just one of those movies you either like a lot or you don't like it at all. I, however, was one of the ones who liked it a lot. I can see why others wouldn't like it and I know it has some flaws, but personally, the flaws don't detract me from the movie. To me, it was worth the ticket price I paid and I will definitely be buying it on blu ray.

Well, I guess I'll start with the good:

1. The special effects are amazing. They make the monsters look and move very life-like.

2. The action is great. I like that they didn't go the shaky cam route so you can actually focus on what was going on.

3. The plot is pretty solid. It's simple and enough to drive the story forward.

4. The acting was good enough as well. It could have been a bit better, but I think most of the actors played their roles well.

Now for the not so good:

1. Aaron Taylor Johnson. In my opinion, his acting was the weakest in the movie. It felt like he didn't put much emotion into his role and that made him come off as rather lackluster due to the fact that he was the lead actor. It also didn't help that he had Cranston's act to follow.

2. I think they could have shown more Godzilla throughout the film.

3. Cranston's death felt a little too early for the film. I wasn't quite fond of this since the way they advertised the movie, it seemed as though Cranston was the lead role in the movie. I feel like they could have had him on board for just a bit longer.

Well, that's pretty much my opinion of the movie after watching it once. I'm wondering if it'll change after watching it again. I might edit my review if it comes to that. All in all it felt like a pretty good movie with some flaws here and there. In my honest opinion, I think the movie was overhyped and that might be why so many were disappointed when they finally watched it. Luckily all the hype didn't kill the movie for me and I still greatly enjoyed it. Now it's time to wait for the sequel and hope that the flaws in this first installment are improved upon so that it can be one hell of a monster movie.",1408060800,2,2139,4.04739336492891

Just another annoying non-entity amidst a cavalcade of exposition-only caricatures. Could Ken Watinabe have been more wasted here? Wait...could Godzilla have been any more wasted? He's hardly even in his own flick! The stars of the show are the Mutos. You know, those bug things that we kept getting to see from far, far above, shredding cities without any sort of shared consequence. I never felt like anything was at stake here. I wanted so badly to give a damn but I was too busy wondering when it was going to end. Sure, the final battle had a couple of fun little elements. But that wasn't enough to justify the prior couple of hours that just dragged. If you want an enjoyable monster movie of the sort, just watch ""Cloverfield"".",1407801600,4,993,4.745664739884393

5955652,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla has finally returned to theatres after a long break. The last American adaptation about this popular character went terribly wrong back in 1998, and thus, I was a bit skeptical about this new one, often wondering if this time, we could see a movie that respects and makes tributes to the original's soul, my personal favourite of this 20+ movie franchise. After seeing this movie, I felt my life as a godzilla movie fan complete.

Godzilla looks incredible, and it actually feels like an authentic godzilla, instead of a giant mutated iguana. The MUTOs are also very awesome-looking, and they where really frightening, and I felt this creatures where the perfect match for Godzilla. Some complaints regarding the fact that there's little screen time for the monters and a lack of fight scenes would have been valid for me, if the filmed lacked any relatable characters we can care about that could drive a movie of this magnitude. Fortunately, this movie didn't suffered from this at all. The human characters where also top notch, and they never got me bored while on screen. That's saying something.

However, when the real fight happens at the last 30 minutes of the film... I was blown away from it becuase they made it in a way so incredible, it has to be seen to be believed. That fight scene alone is worth the price of admission.

This new adaptation of the king of the monsters had the ability to honor its title, and its definitely an excelent begining to what could be a new franchise. The Batman Begins for Godzilla, this new movie delivery tons of action and drama, and comes highly recommended. Fans won't be dissapointed. Instead, they will be cheering each time Godzilla arrives.

5955654,2,B00EXPOCXY,"This movie came as a big disappointment. There is nothing grand about this movie other than the final scene. The directing is pretty bad as the director can't seem to handle the angles and frames that are necessary for this type of movie. This movie has two big problems. One, the acting. The only good performance to come out of this movie is that of Bryan Cranston. He gives an emotional performance and is easily relatable. He is as captivating as they come. Aaron Taylor Johnson is really weak in this movie. He has such a stale and bland face in every scene he is in. Ken Watanabe is just there to deliver the cheesy one-liners in the movie and nothing else because his character is not developed, as neither is Johnson's or any other of the supporting cast. Two, the story. The story hurts the movie a little less than the acting but it leaves a dent anyway. It is so bland and not dynamic, that if it wasn't for the monster action, you would probably fall asleep.

The only good thing to come out of this are the visual effects. The monster fights are not that impressive but what helps the fights is definitely the special effects. The title monster looks incredible as it clearly is an omage to the old Godzilla combined with elements of previous incarnations as is his roar. The win here is the visual effects. The movie is no fun up until the very last scene (I'm not kidding. You'll probably be bored the entire movie until that very last set-piece).",1407628800,4,1462,4.47565543071161
5955655,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Monster movies are supposed to be about the monster. I do not need some lame backstory about a separated family that I do not care about. When is Hollywood going to realize that the subject of these films can carry the film without the dumb human interest crap?

When the action occurred it was good, but again, Hollywood needs to understand that if this was a real event, MONSTERS DO NOT ONLY ATTACK AT NIGHT! How about some well lit, middle of the day, action? It is bad enough that parts were so darkly lit that you couldn't see any detail anyway, but then to have the climax of the film ay night??? Lame, cliched, short-cut film-making.

I'm giving it three stars, because it is Godzilla after all, and the monster design (when you got to see it) was awesome.  Even the ""other monster"" was well done with some interesting qualities.

5955666,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Do not get me wrong this film is a very well placed film, the hype up to the monsters is perfect in my own opinion. I am however very disappointed with Godzilla's screen time, I mean the Movie is called Godzilla not ""monsters terrorize, while people run and a couple really love each other"" thats allot of what I got from this movie and it really bored me, not to mention allot of the scenes felt like the director was teasing too much and trying to focus on being mysterious or ultra realistic and it really felt like he was waving Godzilla in front of my face like a cheap old man with lots of awesome Godzilla merch that he doesn't want to give away but, gets off on the fact that he indeed has Godzilla and I don't. take for example the movie's run time is 123 min. Godzilla and the Mutos are only in the movie for 41 min. over the span of the entire movie, thats 20 min. less than half of the movie, usually a good Godzilla movie does the setup dialog and human perspective in only 1/3rd of the film and the rest of the movie is Godzilla v. monster!

That being said allot of the scenes including Godzilla and the Mutos were very appealing especially for not even having seen a Godzilla flick since 2005 not that long of a stretch but, still almost 10 years. The special effects in this movie were very beautiful as well, not very many people I know thought the atomic breath was as cool as it should have been but, I do not agree I thought it was very realistic and looked amazing and the fight scene at the end is really awesome!!

For something titled Godzilla, there is a startling absence of Godzilla in it.  For a film 123 minutes long, the big G is actually on screen for... 10 minutes.  For a horror film desiring suspense and hidden danger that might still work.  Pictured here, not a suspense driven horror movie though gawd only knows why they actually tried a time or two.

Can forgive the all consuming human actors and their boring non-Kaiju problems somewhat.  Their performance was not inherently bad.

I couldn't really care about the people or their personal tragedies due to this fact that they lacked character development from that point all i wanted was godzilla and they made me wait until the very end.
For everything this film lacked it did have a lot of decent cgi footage, but overall felt this flick was boring to it's core.

5955672,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla.. What to say about that big misunderstood guy this time around. Well, if you know me, my normal gauge for a movie is simple. ""Did I enjoy the movie"" is my number one question. On this one, the answer is yes, but its a qualified yes. I thought the movie was excellent for a Godzilla movie but I had issue with the main human character. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is not, I repeat, NOT, a lead actor. He was fine in Kick-Ass and its sequel but those movies are tongue in cheek types. This was supposed to be a serious monster movie. Yes, that's ridiculous. Its Godzilla for heavens sake. How serious can that be. I suspect that he got the nod for financial reasons and perhaps the fact that he has a thick neck. Maybe the producers thought he would be a realistic Navy officer. Not so much. Plot holes? Well, every single movie ever made has plot holes. So I don't give much weight to that. My second gripe is the design of the Mutos. They looked like they came from a cross between Starship Troopers and Cloverfield. I know it was meant to look like 2 of the baddies in previous Godzilla movies but it wasn't fleshed out well enough.  As for Godzilla, I thought he looked good (even though his face looked like a dogs snout) and he had the right scale to me. I loved the scenes where Godzilla stops during the fighting and seems to shrug and say to himself ""I'm gonna need a minute here"" and then again when he wakes up from the battle and leaves the city. I like how he shifted his gait to step around a building and then just plops down into the water to swim away. The last gripe, and you knew this was coming (if you saw the movie) is the Godzilla roar. The few times he opened up and screamed, he sounded great, but it wasn't the signature Godzilla sound from the originals. I had hoped it would sound exactly like the original sound. All in all, and all things considered, this was a nice reboot for the king of monsters. Lets hope we have a little continuity in the next one.",1407110400,4,1985,4.279255319148936
5955673,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Where to begin on this one.  This movie had some major plot holes to say the least.  It makes the holes in Skyfall look plausible.

The basic plot is that a giant radiation eating bug monster escapes from an underground cocoon and then recocoons itself at the nearest nuclear facility in Japan to feed off the radiation before it hatches again.  A 2nd cocoon from the same hole is taken to Nevada for study.  The 1st monster hatches 15 years later and begins heading to the 2nd monster in Nevada, presumably to make off spring.  This strange event awakens Godzilla from the depths of the ocean to pursue the 1st monster to the 2nd and destroy them both.

The plot holes.  Starting from the most minor.

1.  On the impossible secret.  The movie starts off heavily centric on Bryan Cranston's character, Joe Brody who works in a nuclear facility in Japan.  Soon after losing his wife in a disaster involving the 1st monster, Joe then devotes his life to discovering what really happened, thus alienating his son and family.  Fast forward 15 years.  For whatever reason, the disaster section of Japan has been under radiation quarantine for the past 15.  Secretly, thousands of people still work there, containing the first monster's cocoon.  At no point in the past 15 years apparently has anyone tested for radioactivity, to which there is none, nor has anyone noticed the massive amounts of personnel and construction that had to go into building the facility.  Not to mention, it would be impossible to keep that secret among the massive number of people that work there.

Joe, using nothing more than a Geiger counter somehow discovers that there is secret monster communication going on, while the large number of scientists devoted to its study are oblivious.  Crankston's son, Ford, now an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Officer for the Navy, goes with him to investigate, just when the 1st Monster awakens.  While the monster destroys the facility, Joe is injured.  Somehow, following the event of a giant monster rampaging through facility, injuring and killing hundreds and flying out to sea still remains a secret.  Did no one at the local hospital wonder where all these dead and injured people are coming from?  They would have had to call in outside disaster relief teams, as the military wouldn't have the resources to excavate people from the rubble.

2.  Cranston's stupid death.  Miraculously, Joe survives.  While being medivacked out, he goes into cardiac arrest, but is luckily saved.  About 10 minutes later into the movie, the viewers are then informed Joe died anyway off camera.  The strange survival of the character 2x in 10 minutes and then the sudden write off of him dying off camera makes me wonder if Cranston didn't just walk off set.  Most likely after reading how stupid the script is.  (Getting there btw.)  Still, you'd think the first 40 minutes of Cranston being our main character would be significant to the movie right?  Nope.  Nothing Joe did, leading up to the end of the movie has any bearing on the plot.  Joe's only contribution is to explain to the audience that the monsters talk, which is completely insignificant to the plot, and does nothing to forward the story or help the scientists/military and stopping the monsters.

3.  How are the monster's tracking radiation?  So the monsters feed off nuclear energy, which we first see when the 1st monster attacks a Russian submarine and feeds off its reactor and nuclear arsenal.  Okay, still buying the premise, but how is it that these monster can sense radiation when there is no radiation leaking from the sub?  How exactly are these monster finding the radiation over hundreds of miles, when someone standing right next to the reactor would register 0 radiation?  BTW, this is how the 1st monster ended up in Japan from running to the closest nuclear facility after escaping its cave.  How did the monster know there was radiation there?  Maybe it used the force.

4.  The 1st monster attacks Hawaii.  Okay, the monster, looking for another energy source, B-lines to Hawaii and destroys the place.  Okay, maybe it wasn't looking for another energy source, because I really have no idea why it would hit Hawaii when it is trying to get to the U.S. shoreline (I will explain this next).  You'd think stopping off in Hawaii would only slow it down, so I can only assume it stopped for a snack.  Strangely, our hero Ford is already there, but cool. i will buy that for the sake of logic.  What doesn't make sense is that this radiation tracking monster completely ignores the Navy's nuclear fleet at Pearl Harbor, and the Nuclear Battle Group pursuing it.  You'd think all of them nuclear reactors would be like tasty treats to this radiation eating monster that can sense contained radiation over hundreds of miles.  But hey, maybe the monster just didn't notice, or maybe it's the fact Godzilla shows up now and start beating some monster tail.  Even if Godzilla scared it off, you'd think the 1st monster would have still B-Lines to Pearl Harbor, or turned on the Battle Group directly behind it first.

5.  The 2nd Monster.  Now we discover there is a 2nd monster in Nevada.  Immediately a special operations team enters the secret underground facility in Nevada to try and destroy the second monster cocoon, only to discover that the chamber holding it is completely busted open, and thousands of tons of ground above has been ripped open, leaving a big path of destruction that leads directly through the middle of Las Vegas.  Strange, you'd think they would have noticed something like that before they went inside the facility, but our special operations guys are truly surprised, not expecting a massive hole that probably registered about 6 degrees on the Richter scale.

6.  A stupid plan.  Now both monsters are heading towards San Francisco and the brilliant plan is to take a nuclear bomb, and use it to lure the monsters to an unpopulated zone and detonate it on them.  Again, assuming these monster's can sense nuclear radiation in a sealed container, as they have demonstrated up until now, it doesn't make sense that they'd go after one bomb, when just south of them is a massive nuclear Navy Port/Base at San Diego Ca.  This isn't to mention the numerous nuclear energy facilities our monsters have already passed up on their trip to meet up.  Maybe it's just the nuclear bombs themselves, which I don't understand how the monsters know the difference, but Banger Submarine Base up in Washington State houses a major stockpile of nuclear ballistic missiles which would have to be far more appealing than the one stupid nuke they are dangling like a carrot on a string.

7.  Stupid plan part 2.  Because the monster emits an EMP pulse that kills all electronics, they place the nuclear bomb on a timer, which, guess what?  Is electronic.  They also don't account for the fact that the monster may actually just take the nuke and continue to its destination, which it does.  At this point I have no idea why the two monsters converge in San Francisco which has no radiation, but the 2nd monster brings the nuclear bomb with her, (you know the nuke on a timer) which now requires the military to go in and disable, before it wipes out Southern California, to which it would likely have done anyway even if their first stupid plan worked.

8.  Our friend Ford is the only EOD person.  Okay, we are on the western part of the United States, and we need a special operations team to go in, and disable the nuke.  As happenstance would have it, our hero Ford is the only EOD guy among the thousands of military people present and at least 50 bases/forts and across all the services.  Additionally, Ford also knows how to disable a nuclear device, which I am pretty sure they don't teach at EOD school, but that is a forgivable oversight, especially considering the fact that for some unknown reason, he is THE ONLY EOD GUY!  I have been in the Navy for 16 years, and was even prior service Army.  EODs are few, but among all those bases/forts, there should be tons of EODs on hand to handle this operation.  They aren't that rare.  They also don't bring a nuclear specialist with them, who'd know how to disable a nuclear bomb, which hinges the survival of millions of people on one EOD guy who has never seen, worked or trained on a nuclear device.  Honestly, what would have happened if he'd died before making it to the nuke like the one guy they mentioned who died parachuting in?

9.  No monster sex.  When the 2nd monster appears, our scientists somehow deduces with absolutely no evidence what so ever, that the first monster is a male, and going to meet up with the second monster, a female.  How they know this is never explained, but when the two monsters meet up in San Fran, which is assumed to mate and make off spring, they do no such thing.  Instead the 2nd female monster simply stows away the nuclear bomb it captures and craps out some eggs.  Honestly, if we aren't going to see some Monster's Gone Wild in the streets of San Fran, then why were we following the 1st stupid ass monster across the pacific to begin with?  We could have just started the movie with the 2nd monster, which would have saved me 2 hours of my life that could have been better spent watching porn.  The 2nd monster could have simply laid its eggs in Nevada and been done with it.  In fact, the only thing the 1st Monster did, was lead Godzilla directly to the female monster, whose entire species's survival hinges on.

10.  Our special operations guys find the nuke, which is just really sitting there doing nothing but counting down.  Piss poor planning what it is, our guys forget to bring basic tools, so they are unable to open the nuke and disarm it when the hatch cover is warped.  This has to be the absolute dumbest EOD specialist on the planet to forget basic welding tools.  That's like a boyscout without a compass.  Imagine a plumber showing up at your house and trying to explain to you he didn't think he would need a wrench to fix your leaking facet.

11.  No chance of survival.  Our buddy Ford takes the nuke to a fishing dock and places it on a trolley to be taken out to sea before it detonates.  With 5 minutes on the counter, Ford is suddenly air lifted out and taken to safety while the bomb detonates behind him.  Okay, some math here.  This is a 50 Megaton Bomb.  Its immediate blast radius is 62 miles,  and its danger area is about 3x that (third degree burns and possible incineration).  Its shock wave reaches 560 miles and registers an 8.0 on the Richter scale.  Ford is on a Trolley going about 10 - 15 knots, that about 15 - 18 miles per hour with less than 10 minutes on the clock.  With only 10 minutes, it would have taken Ford 4 hours to get the bomb outside the blast radius, which even if he'd done, still would have left a sonic boom, and being that close to shore, would have displaced enough water to drown the entire city under the ocean.  But that's irrelevant because he'd never have escaped the blast radius, and neither would have the city.  Furthermore, there is no way in hell Ford could have been air lifted to safety with only 5 minutes on the clock, and absolutely 0 chance the Navy would have risked trying to save him.

12.  About the monster fight.  Godzilla is powning our two monsters.  The 1st monster at this point has somehow shrunk dramatically from when we first saw it in Japan and Hawaii.  Midway through the fight, our guy Ford has destroyed the monster eggs by detonating a gas truck, and runs off.  Of the hundreds of thousands of people running for their lives, the mother monster (2nd monster) immediately recognizes Ford as the culprit.  No idea how.

13.  Very brief Night time fighting only.  All fights or destruction of cities occur at night. We do get some day time images of the monsters walking, but all action sequences occur at night.  During the big climax when Godzilla has to fight the monster, we never see any full on monster action, but rather very brief clashes before the camera cuts away.  In addition to it being night time, its also raining to further obscure the monsters.  This is most likely to hide cheap CGI effects and save money.  The only 2 occurrences when the monsters attack at day is during the Nevada facility destruction, and the rampage through Las Vegas.  Both occur off camera for inexplicable reasons.  At this point, there is no reason to hide the monster from the viewers because both Godzilla and the 1st monster have been seen.  This was simple laziness on the directors part, and probably done to save a buck.  When the monsters do meet, we never see them for longer than a few seconds at a time.  In the Hawaii scene, as soon as Godzilla and the 1st monster meet, we are cut away to a kid sleeping on a couch while the monsters fight on TV.  Really, a giant monster fight seen through a television set being watched by someone else watching it in a movie theater. If you got this movie at home, you are literally watching someone else watch the movie you wanted to see.

14.  Have seen this monster before?  The 2nd monster looks very similar to the monster from Cloverfield.  I can't help feeling this was done to save money on creating another monster for the film.",1407024000,20,13280,4.628852739726027

Of all Godzilla's different versions, the 1998 one completely missed the mark, this Godzilla 2014 movie puts him back where he belongs, in charge.

5955676,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Last movie I saw G was back in Godzilla 1985 midnight showing. It was fun, exciting watching a godzilla movie that late.

Let's talk about the present Godzilla 2014 which is a good movie and I purchased a pre-pay ticket for the premiere. I missed the release night
because I started a thursday night class, but they took my ticket anyways.

The pace of the movie was expected just like all the other g-movies, story line was good and build up was really good. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat and when he makes an appearance the audience were just going crazy, hollering, clapping and foot stomping; I thought it was the IMAX effects and sound.

The right actors for the right characters and recognized the one man who was in the first godzilla movie. He really stayed in from the beginning to the very end of the movie. I love this female actor who played, doctor/nurse and the husband is in the military service. Yes, she's the 3rd olsen sister of MK & Ashley. I have to say she did a great job acting in this movie and hopefully to see her again in the big screen.

The appearance and action scenes of Godzilla was just amazing, just like fine wine, ages very well. The guy doesn't look like a day over 30 years. The audience really loved it seeing him doing his thing and hearing all screams, holllers, high fives and clapping.

The only thing I didn't like or a complete waste using 3D because there was no action that really used it. There wasn't enough action for the debris or anything being thrown at us. It would be a good scene if Godzilla roared at us in our face then that would be COOL.

I would definitely would get the full combo pack to have in my collection. I would get a regular copy of the movie itself because this pack is going in my collection with the original movie Gojira and others. Most of them are still shrink wrap because they are the greatest movies of all time",1406678400,3,1902,4.328651685393258

5955678,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Impatient viewers could be understandably upset about the slow reveal here. While the star attraction might be missing from the first half of the film, there are still a plethora of epic shots of giant craters, crumbling buildings, detonating A-bombs, etc. in the meantime.

But the story here is not good. Again, this is yet another blockbuster movie built around a special effect, so the first hour of plot is foolishly filled with all the characters dumbly wondering, ""What's going on here? How could this possibly happen?"" though every viewer knows what's happening by the title and ads before they even start watching.

The family of characters here are excessive. In many ways, this is a creature feature or disaster porn, so the main attraction is the special effects. Yet of course the suits bankrolling this film wants some grounded and relatable characters upfront for the everyman to relate to. One treacly father-son relationship is enough for one of these films, but how about two. Let's throw in some wives and moms too. So with three full generations of characters all loving/fighting each other to woo your sympathies, it's a bit excessive to invest so much time on dysfunctional families. Bryan Cranston's acting is ludicrously over-the-top here. His big faces, emoting and screaming are more fit for an outdoor theater rather than this silly popcorn flick. It's both enjoyable and cringe-inducing.

The ultimate irony is that while the movie invests so much time building up these characters, making sure you love and feel for each and every one of them, the people simply don't matter. When all is said and done, the humans in this story have ZERO impact on the events, only serving as background props and collateral damage while Godzilla comes and goes.

But again, the primary allure of this film is the titular creature. And once the monster action finally arrives during the back end, the film delivers on the effects and spectacle. I found the look and feel of the giant beasts here far superior than last summer's ""Pacific Rim."" While that movie (which had giant robots too) looked very cartoony and moved at this falsely slow and lumbering pace, this film has a much more natural presentation of the action, not relying on splashy lighting tricks and flamboyant backgrounds. The fights are not so nimble, but the monsters wrestle, push and bite each other in a consistently solid spectacle while demolishing San Francisco.

Be patient with this film, and you'll get treated to a great finale. It definitely has some grave flaws with its syrupy storylines, but I believe the fantastic action is worth enduring its weaknesses.",1406592000,3,2651,4.98868778280543

Now that I'm approaching 30-years-old, I've come to appreciate the special effects work, the music of Akira Ifukube, and the direction of Ishiro Honda and Jun Fukuda. I also love the Hesei era films, Godzilla vs. King Gidorah being my particular favorite. Then came Zilla '98, which sucked horribly. I still remember Gene Shalit's review, saying that 'Godzilla had been caught up in the exercise craze,' and that he looked more like a large iguana than the Big G we all know. My older sister and her husband took me to see it with their family and I tried desperately to like it, but the lizard couldn't fool me, it didn't even have atomic breath! And the scene with the hatching babies harkened back more to the raptors in Jurassic Park than anything I remember about my child-hood hero. In short, Zilla '98 was not a Godzilla movie. I thought Godzilla was over and I hoped that Toho never worked with a Western movie-maker again. I thought the Millennium series films became hard to follow, the only one that I really, really like is Godzilla 2000 for it's special effects and amount of Godzilla footage (yes, it did have a LOT of Godzilla footage), but that isn't necessarily what makes a Godzilla movie good. Quality over quantity (if you don't believe me, see Godzilla vs. Megalon).

While it is true that some Godzilla movies feature more Big G footage than others (see above), the really, really, good ones only have him appearing at the most dramatic moments, which makes for better story telling  see ""The Terror of Mechagodzilla,"" where he doesn't make an appearance until well into film and the battle with Titanosaurus last's only a few minutes. And, by the way, Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla also got more screen time in that movie than the Big G. (Go to a few concerts, sit through three hours of warm-up bands, and then the headliner comes out and does a 40-minute show).

When I heard that an American company was making a new Godzilla movie I felt sick. I was afraid they would ruin it  AGAIN. But I kept saying, for nearly three years, ""if they do it like Jaws, it'll be good."" I kept telling fellow Godzilla fans in my family that they need to do a ""slow reveal,"" lead up to it, give us teases and glimpses. I also said, ""when we finally see the Big G, he better damn well look like GOJIRA, not some damn lizard!"" So Speilberg used a different technique with Jurassic Park than he did with Jaws and I recommend that Gareth Edwards does this with the second installment. The first movie was great as an introduction to the Godzilla of the 21st Century, now we need a little more monster action, more fights, more battles, and more of THE KING. But even as a standalone fillm, I really loved Godzilla 2014 and was more than satisfied. My ONLY beef was that I wish the first fight had lasted a little longer and had been a little easier to see. I like what Edwards did with that scene, in order to give us a real-world interpretation of what it would look like ""from the ground,"" but a little more cinematic monster action would have made that scene perfect.

The HALO jump scene  magnificent! I felt like I could reach out and touch the Big G, especially in 3-D. It was awesome (as in, awe-struck / fear-inducing), and eerie at the same time.

Oh, and I must make mention of Taylor-Johnson's acting. This is the first film I had ever seen him in. I wasn't interested in the Kick Ass films and was leery of his part in this film. But I thought he was fine to carry it through. I must say, I don't know if he does it on purpose or by accident, but he seems to be one of those actors that conveys the feeling more through body language or facial expression than by having to SAY SOMETHING all the time. I thought his acting harkened back to actors like Steve McQueen (I'm not placing Taylor-Johnson on the same level of movie star, only comparing acting styles) and there are few scenes where I felt he accomplished it  you can tell exactly what he's thinking, or saying to himself, or feeling by the expression on his face and in his eyes. People nowadays do not pay attention to those kinds of things. People nowadays almost have to have a movie narrated and explained to them to ""get it."" Think, McFly, think! Pay attention, be observant. There is usually more going on than meets the naked eye; feelings and messages are often being conveyed by the actors and the director which are often left unsaid. I appeal to Jaws again  the scene where Richard Dreyfus is in the shark-cage, in the water, and looks up at Roy Schreider's character and says ""I've got no spit."" What do you think the message or feeling was that we being conveyed there? What about Dreyfus' acting while entirely underwater and you couldn't hear him say anything at all? Did he convey any thoughts or feelings? What about when Brody is climbing up the mast and the shark is trying to get him? No talking there either. Modern movies seem to have talking through every part, the character has to SAY what they're feeling, rather than merely exhibit. Audiences seem to have lost all ability to put any of themselves into a story anymore.

In my opinion, a person would have to admit that the acting in this film was AT THE VERY LEAST as good as the Japanese-made films. It could NOT have been any worse, especially when considering the horrible English overdubs, which weren't any fault of the Japanese cast.

I own or have watched almost every single Godzilla film ever made. My instant favorites are
Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster
(Godzilla doesn't show up for well into the movie in that one, plot is silly),

The Invasion of Astro-Monster
(silly plot, very little Godzilla footage relative to the rest of the film),

Godzilla vs. Gigan
(one of the stupidest plots ever, horrible acting, stupidest plot elements (Godzilla sharing a conversation with Anguirus)),

Godzilla vs. Hedorah
(crazy plot, more Godzilla footage, stupid music, stupid thematic elements, Godzilla get's beat up pretty bad),

Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla
(incredibly ridiculous plot, Godzilla get's really, really, injured, and some supernatural help from God(?)), and my all-time favorite:

The Terror of Mechagodzilla (crazy plot, subpar acting, relatively little Godzilla footage, best music, best directing, best Godzilla reveals, best fights, etc).

I also love the Hesei-era:

Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla
(again  crazy plot, good monster battles, unbelievable elements, and Rodan dies!!!), and

Godzilla vs. King Gidorah
(the best of the Hesei-era, in my opinion; sub-par acting, horrible overdubs, craziest plot of them all, so much time-traveling that Doc Brown would get confused!).

After that, Godzilla 2000 was probably my favorite, or at least the one I would almost always throw in the DVD player when I was in the mood for a Godzilla movie for the past 5 years  either that or Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster.

In my opinion, Godzilla 2014 has all of the elements that make a good Godzilla movie. Slow and dramatic reveals, a more believable plot, decent acting, and a story that backs the whole thing. Gojira also looks good! He looks BIG, MEAN, and ready to reestablish himself as THE KING OF THE MONSTERS! He also has some anthropomorphic qualities without going overboard, such as the (spoiler alert):

atomic breath scene where he slightly bows back and let's the MUTO have it! Or, in the final scene where he decisively beats the female MUTO. Or earlier, when the male MUTO was flying around (just before the tail kick) and Godzilla looks up with an angry expression and snarls, as if to say ""That's it! You're finished!""

The subtitle for this film should have been ""THE RETURN OF THE KING.""",1406505600,6,8285,4.700483091787439

5955683,5,B00EXPOCXY,"*The Crowgrrl has always been a huge Godzilla fan. You betcha I was at the theater opening weekend to see the latest eponymous incarnation  in 3D, no less  and I was NOT disappointed. I love it!

I was a little worried about if this Godzilla would stay true to the character  the Matthew Broderick version sure didnt. That version shouldve been called the sea creature that attacked NYC, NOT Godzilla. I was afraid something similar might have been in store with this flick.

Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised with The Big Green Guy in this version  he looked more like a refined version of the Toho Studios original. He was vibrant and believable, making him my favorite to date. I just wish he had more screen-time than he was given. For much of the movie, we just saw his distinctive spine above water as he swam to mankinds rescue flanked by a Naval escort.

The movie featured a solid storyline, great acting, and breathtaking FX despite its ominous, sinister, bleak atmosphere.

But, yes, the movie was not only about Zilla, but also about the people affected by him and his giant adversaries. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is an American living in Japan with his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and young son, Ford (CJ Adams).  He and his wife are both working at a nuclear power plant. An earthquake-like disaster destroys the plant, and Sandra was fatally trapped inside.

The grief-stricken Joe becomes obsessed with finding the cause of the disaster. Seismic readings show a voice. At the time of the tragedy, that voice was getting a similar reply, convincing him this is not a natural disaster.

Segue to a grown Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) with a family of his own: wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and Sam (Carson Bolde). Hes in the military, and his specialty is disarming bombs. He gets a call informing him that his father is jailed in Japan for returning to the site of the former nuclear plant. Ford goes to bail him out, only to be drawn into his fathers quest. Hes convinced  that the answer to the seismic voice is foretelling another imminent disaster, but no one will listen to who they think of as a fanatic madman.

That is, until a giant, insect-like abomination emerges from the bowels of the Earth. A similar creature (this one  the female  doesnt have wings like her male counterpart) surfaces in Nevada. Apparently, the seismic voices that were being picked up were the monsters mating call. If they succeed in reproducing, they will become Earths apex predators and will destroy the world as we know it. The monstrosities feed off energy  including energy produced by exploding bombs. If attacked by artillery, the beasties just get stronger. There is apparently no way for mankind to defeat them.

Enter Japanese scientist, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe)  who also knows about the seismic voices, and observed that a dormant Zilla was awakened by these mating calls as well. Zilla instinctively wants to crush these things to restore Nature to its normal balance. Zilla  becomes mankinds sole hope for the future. However, he may have met his match with these formidable foes.

I cant wait for this puppy to come out on DVD (scheduled for a September 16, 2014 release)  I know Im going to snap up a copy, and I recommend that all you G-Fans out there do the same.

Speaking of Godzilla, The Crowgrrl seriously recommends that  you check out the artwork of contemporary Kaiju artist Sean McGuinness. I met Sean at the Scares that Care Weekend this past June, and loved his work  especially the piece entitled Blue Sky Tripping.",1406332800,3,3557,4.79344262295082

5955685,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Obviously the pro-Godzilla 2014 faction is winning the Amazon review war (also IMDB), and that is really driving me crazy at the moment because 1) Godzilla 2014 is, objectively, a TERRIBLE film and 2) the strawman arguments that are being used against negative reviews are ludicrously offbase.

First, let me incinerate these strawman arguments in a blaze of atomic fire:

Strawman A) people who wanted to see more of Godzilla are idiots who wish it was like Transformers or Pacific Rim. WRONG. I, and everyone else I know above age 12, hates the Transformers movies. As for Pacific Rim, it's meh for me. Not only that, the Godzilla 2014 fight scenes, although getting very few minutes on screen, share the exact flaws that make the fights in those other franchises so unappealing compared to classic Godzilla. The way CG tends to homogenize all imagery into a blur of polygons. The way it crimps the design imagination, so that Mutos are indistinguishable from PR kaijus or cloverfields, and like them instantly forgettable, in complete contrast to Godzilla's unforgettable classic foes. The way it forces directors to set battles blurrily in the midst of night and smoke and dust and rain to attempt to conceal the falseness of the CG image. Aside from the five second finishing move, the battles in Godzilla 2014 LOOK AWFUL. They are moronically conceived and choreographed in nasty-looking CG using a palette of about 50 shades of gray. Truth: we dislike Godzilla 2014 because it is so SIMILAR to Transformers and PR at a basic visual (and narrative) level. I didn't wish very hard for more Godzilla fighting scenes because they were almost as tedious as the non-fighting parts of the movie. I just wanted the movie to be over.

Strawman B) People who disliked the movie aren't real Godzilla fans and are too dumb to appreciate the suspense and focus on the human characters of the original Godzilla or of Jaws, etc. See, here is the thing about Godzilla 54 and Jaws: they are brilliantly scripted films with characters we care about who are believably caught up in suspenseful events. Godzilla 14 could not be LESS similar to films like that. It has a risible script full of completely unengaging characters (it takes real effort to waste great actors like Cranston and Watanabe, but they managed it) whose supposed peril does not sustain our suspension of disbelief for any length of time as the script hammers us with a series of woodenly/hammingly acted and contrived situations. The reason we couldn't stand waiting so long for Godzilla to show up is not that we have short attention spans and diminished capacity for delayed gratification, it is that we have STANDARDS about what a movie should do to tell a good story with appealing characters, a task at which Godzilla 14 flopped more miserably even than Transformers. I mean, even Transformers had some faintly amusing and memorable minor characters, whereas there was not one single memorable or non-cringeworthy character in Godzilla 14. As wooden as the romance in Pacific Rim was, it was Romeo and Juliet compared to the black hole of chemistry that was stupid Ford and his stupid family.

So now that's cleared up, let me list the other factors that make Godzilla 14, objectively, a terrible movie. Godzilla 54 had the Ifukube score that is one of the five greatest movie scores of the 20th century. Godzilla 14 had a messy aural assault that made the Transformers soundtracks seem restrained by comparison. Godzilla 54 was able to make a completely fantastical weapon like the oxygen destroyer function believably in the storyline, thoughtfully tied in to the themes and characters of the film. Godzilla 14 made actually existing weapons, nuclear missiles, totally UNbelievable by creating mind-bendingly stupid and contrived scenarios for their use. In Godzilla 54 we were made to care deeply about anonymous children bereaved by the rampage through great cinematography. In Godzilla 14 we could not even identify with the peril and terror of the main character's own son, much less the random Asian kid on the tram, because they were placed in such ludicrous contexts by the terrible script. I could add 20 other point by points that demonstrate why Godzilla 14 bears NO resemblance and does no honor to Godzilla 54, and the fanboys who think that just waiting the same amount of time as the original did to reveal the monster makes them the same are doing more of an injustice to a character they claim to love than any of the -- totally justified and accurate -- negative reviews.

I understand that fans want to be supportive of the franchise so more movies get made, so they are finding a way to convince themselves that a terrible movie (a far worse movie than the much-maligned Godzilla 1984, for example) was a triumphant return to Godzilla's roots rather than a bloated, gormless Hollywood cash-in. But ask yourself... do you really WANT more Godzilla movies like this? Really? Personally, I would prefer that a stinker like this bomb and keep Hollywood away from the big lizard for another 20 years, because the fact is that Godzilla 2014 is the worst Godzilla movie ever made. It is worse than the English dub of Godzilla Raids Again, including having worse dialogue. Yeah, I went there.

If you love Godzilla, you SHOULD hate this movie. And if you love great movies and are not personally invested in wanting Godzilla to ride the Hollywood sequel treadmill (hint hint, some of the vehement positive reviews are obviously from insiders), you WILL hate this movie.",1406246400,19,5545,4.912486659551761
5955686,4,B00EXPOCXY,"There are movies which instantly remind you of vacations and time spent at the movies - Godzilla is one of them - it has all the elements that make a successful blockbuster - action, horror, thriller and disaster. Godzilla is the best example of man trying to control nature and failing miserably.
This Godzilla movie is far better than the version made in 1998. Gareth Edwards, the britisher known for the film Indie film Monsters ( Yes, that is the name of that film), works on a script that is deliberately slow with Godzilla making his entry only after half the movie is over. Here is a monster who loves uranium like popsicles.
 It has a very fast paced sequence involving a meltdown of a nuclear facility in Japan ( echoing Fukushima). The movie deliberately has a subdued tone but Edwards uses every cinematic trick to get the job done- camera angles, music, the rampage and the climax are all worth watching. The best scenes are the HALO ( High-altitude military parachuting ) jumps against dark skies ( Beautiful) - the rampage in Hawaii- at the beach, the airport, the rail track and the Golden Gate Bridge Combat.
CGI and the monster withstanding - some fine actors grace the screen and make the movie worth a watch- Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche and  Ken Watanabe.
The Godzilla in this movie is a little different instead of a product of nuclear war- he is the created by nuclear testing in the Pacific. But the scriptwriters had to add a remark about Hiroshima.",1406160000,2,1477,4.676923076923077
5955687,2,B00EXPOCXY,"There are so many problems with this 2nd attempt at Hollywood trying to reimagine TOHO's most famous daikaiju that I know full well that I'm setting myself up to catch pure hellgrammite from the pretentious goose-stepping brigade... especially when I mention-- with *NO* reservations or shame --that the Roland Emmerich 1998 reinterpretation, though flawed as it is in many respects, is still the best handling of the source material since 1954's original trendsetter, ""Gojira,"" and even the Raymond Burr corrupted, ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters.""

(For those ever-so-few of you who have not immediately stopped reading any further and automatically ""voted down"" my review because of what I'd just said, I'll try to finish making my case as concisely as possible.)

Many of the common complaints regarding this latest American [mis]handling of Tokyo's famous giant lizard are without question valid and justified (e.g., a movie called ""Godzilla"" with little or no focus on the title character; not enough daikaiju battle scenes; slow & meandering plot; whereas complaints about Emmerich's 1998 monster focused on its sleekness & swiftness, this one suffers from the exact opposite problem of being a waddling BMI nightmare more deserving of the name, ""LARD-zilla""; etc.) -- all of those concerns are worthy of unfettered scrutiny.

However, there's another element of concern I'd like to add to that mix, and it relates directly to the title heading I'd chosen for this review.

We are all well aware that it was the ""Gojira/Godzilla"" franchise which gave rise to the daikaiju craze, especially serving as the inspiration for DAIEI's own superstar: everybody's favorite giant fire-breathing turtle, ""Gamera.""

That ""Gamera"" is viewed as a ""rip-off"" of Gojira is both understandable and a valid viewpoint. So with that being the case, no one would ever expect the ""master"" to try to steal material or technique from the ""pupil,"" as it were... But that's exactly what this 2nd Hollywood ""reimagining"" did! At least ONE of the three credited writers of this film had obviously not only seen but was clearly very heavily influenced by the ""Gamera"" reboot series, in particular the first installment, called, ""GAMERA: Daikaiju Kutyuu Kessen"" (or, as the American distributors mistranslated it: ""Gamera: Guardian of the Universe"").

Not only did this/these writer(s) swipe ""elements"" from the Gamera reboot introductory story, (t)he(y) essentially swiped the ENTIRE story! LITERALLY! It is the EXACT SAME STORY!

So even though I may catch all sorts of hate for daring to say that I am among a very small handful who actually LIKED the Emmerich ""Godzilla"" (which without all the lighthearted fluff definitely would've made it more of what it unquestionably *SHOULD* have been), even among those who swear up-&-down how much they ""hated"" the 1998 movie (which I'm convinced most of them are doing just so nobody can talk-down to them -- you know, that whole ""herd mentality"" thing), even they will have to be honest enough to admit (and I dare say, appreciate) that the Emmerich movie at least tried to do something different and original and tried to take the concept & idea in a new, fresh direction, whether for better or for worse. This 2014 abomination, however, is in effect transferring the contents from a ""Coca-Cola"" bottle and trying to pass it off as a ""Pepsi"" -- those who are familiar with the product know it for what it is and can see through the ""packaging.""

So on top of everything else that's wrong with 2014's ""Godzilla,"" as many have already addressed in some detail, there's another group of us who are equally upset with many of those same issues, but who bring to the table the added complaint that we've already seen this movie, back when it was called ""GAMERA: The Giant-Monster Mid-Air Battle.""",1406073600,8,3816,5.104166666666667

So even if you don't like the character development of the humans involved the pure spectacle of the monster scenes should be enough to keep you happy. It is highly evident to me that the people involved in this film LOVED the main character and had a blast bringing him to life. Thanks Gareth!!!! If Warners is building a franchise around Godzilla I hope they have the sense to keep people involved who are truly passionate about the subject matter. I wish they would do a spin off project with Rodan fighting a couple of other established monsters before they do a sequel to this film. I doubt it will happen though. And since rumor is the next foe for Godzilla is Mothra (while i love the character I can see the reviewers now critizing Godzilla fighting a giant moth) I just hope they know what they are doing as I wouldnt want the franchise to lose steam with the masses. I would think Rodan or Ghidorah to be better choices but Gareth Edwards apparently knows what he is doing. Bottom line if you like Godzilla you will love this film.

5955703,5,B00EXPOCXY,"So, me being a 17 year old teen, who grew up with movies like lord of the rings, titanic, and all those great films has surprisingly high expectations for films as simple as these now a days. Also, considering I had only seen the original Godzilla and the 1998 abomination (thank god it was renamed), I was hoping for this reboot to be similar to the original 1954 one (the best one to me.)

Did it deliver on story? :enough to keep me entertained and in to the movie.

Did the character development work well with it? : Joe (Brian cranstons character) put a wonderful performance in this movie. Taylor Johnson was pretty good too! People complain about his emotions being rather dull and lifeless, but guys, HES A SOLDIER. What do you think training and all that does to a person? He operates like a real soldier would and when he is with his family, he is great! Shows emotion, caring, even on this one over the phone scene! The cast overall was very strong and played their characters fairly well overall.

Plot:
First time seeing this movie, I was slightly confused in how it was formatted so I did t quite get it. Especially when you're in a theater with 20 other friends sitting around you and a packed full theater on opening night. So, I went a second time to see it with just one friend. And I must say... The plot works really well! The seriousness in this movie is quite awesome! I love the origins in this story though. It seems more realistic (IN A VERY GOOD WAY) than pervious Godzilla films! (You never know. Maybe there once was a time where animals fed off of the earths natural radiation. We don't fully know our past. Keep an open mind when seeing this movie.)

Monster design:
Godzilla: now the suites and all that stuff was great back then, but being upgraded to the motion sensitive CGI that this movie displays.... Godzilla looks absolutely incredible!!!! He looks like a force of nature and not some cheesy guy in a suite (which I do love to though lol.) his atomic breath was fierce, yet elegant, and his roar.... His roar is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!

The MUTO:
Designed similarly to the clover field monster, the mutos add yet another enemy to the many lists of enemies Godzilla has had to face. They were very well done!!! Sound effects, CGI, everything was well done about them!

Overall movie:
This movie uses the slow burn effect used in blockbuster films like jaws and little hints and nods at other films like Jurassic park. I personally loved those little shots like that! How they stay true to the films in which the idea of this one is derived from was so fantastic! A little bit more Godzilla would have been nice, a little more action, but you know what, this movie is NOT pacific rim. It is NOTHING LIKE pacific rim. It is just like its origin back in 1954.
The teasing in this film kept me on the edge of my seat as well. It made the final 12-13 minutes of the film entirely worth the wait to see. And god, what a good 12-13 minutes that was! NOT SAYING ANYTHING... Don't wanna ruin it for those who haven't seen this yet.
My final words to you fellow views of this review: ""the king has returned and is ready to kick ass once again!""

It's basically a Godzilla movie without Godzilla. Even Cloverfield was better than this. Pacific Rim definitely was.

I waited about 2 hours before Godzilla finally took center stage and by that time I was pretty bored. Compared to other action movies out this summer (i.e. x-man or edge of tomorrow) this movie tried too hard to make us care about the people. Even compared to Pacific rim, the movie makers lost their way. You know when you're watching a movie that you are ahead of and you're waiting for the movie to catch up to you? Well, this is that kind of movie. I didn't care about the people or their personal tragedies I just wanted Godzilla and they made me wait until the very end for him.

I remember when I dressed up as Godzilla for Halloween.  If it's any consolation to the 1998 Godzilla, his nemesis KING KONG didn't do much better in the box office standing.",1405382400,6,460,4.573170731707317
5955709,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Making a film about a giant prehistoric irradiated lizard/dinosaur has always been a challenge. Even back in 1954 when Toho Studios created GOJIRA, which featured a man in a rubber suit stomping miniature buildings and chomping on trains was a dubious success at best. But after 60 years, and several films by Toho as well as an attempted Americanized blockbuster in 1998 by the team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich who were considered blockbuster creators after the astonishing success of INDEPENDENCE DAY, the King of Monsters still eluded critical success. But now, with indie film director Gareth Edwards at the help, a few hundred million dollars for the budget, an amazing cast of some of the great leading and supporting actors currently living, and a wonderful extension of the mythology, GODZILLA finally has the film we deserve.

At least, for the most part. The film opens fifteen years in the past as scientists Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) discover gigantic skeletal remains and two egg-like sacs, one intact, and one recently opened with a trail towards the sea. Meanwhile, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) are working at a nuclear power plant in Japan. Something starts to happen and soon the whole power plant and surrounding areas are in danger. Brody has to even sacrifice his own wife (at her behest) to save the rest of the plant from the surging radiation, but the destruction doesn't stop there. Cut to the present. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has just returned to his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son in San Francisco after a tour in one of America's far-off wars, only to have to go back to Japan to bail his father Joe out of prison for trespassing in the quarantine zone that surrounds the nuclear plant he once worked in. Since his wife's death, Joe has been obsessed with finding the truth of what happened there, and is wholly convinced that it was not an earthquake or some kind of natural occurence as the authorities contend. Soon, a giant winged creature nicknamed a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) erupts from one of the eggs discovered in the opening from a containment unit, and Ford finds himself on the frontlines of a war that may not be able to be won by humankind. Serizawa is convinced that there is an Alpha Predator called Gojira (or Godzilla when Americanized) that can fight this MUTO because he is less of a creature of destruction but rather a force of nature that can restore balance if he is allowed to fight the MUTO. Ford comes along for the ride when his training in bomb disposal comes in handy, but ultimately, it's up to Godzilla, who might win the day but also cause even more destruction.

There are a few problems with this film, and almost all of them involve Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who suffers from being an actor who is just not up to the task of carrying this film. His constant expressionless face and voice are far too bland, but that might be the point. Most of the great actors in this film, like Cranston, Watanabe, Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Olsen are relegated largely to the sidelines because their power as performers (particularly Cranston and Watanabe, who rule in this film) might potentially distract from the monster mayhem happening on screen.

The other problem is that this film suffers from the same problem that all the other Godzilla films do: Too many humans and not enough monsters. Although, when it comes right down to it, that's probably more of a budgetary concern rather than a storytelling one.

However, when we DO get the monsters, they are absolutely breathtaking. The new Godzilla design makes him more massive and formidable than he has ever looked. His scream is amped up to eleven. The MUTO seems a little bit like Rodan at first (but sadly isn't), but there's never a moment that you don't buy what's happening on screen with the monsters.

I do have to tell you that I went into this film with a lot of trepidation. Godzilla films have let me down before, but the one thing that none of the trailers or commercials showed was Godzilla's atomic breath. I knew that if I didn't get that, no matter how good the rest of the film might have been, I'd have felt cheated. All I can tell you is this: I do NOT feel cheated. Believe me when I say that there are some serious fist-pumping moments in this film that stand out, and congratulations are in order to director Edwards for allowing a film like this to have moments like that. Some non-Godzilla fans who were in the theater with me were looking at me like I was insane when these moments occured. If I had been with a big audience, I'm sure there would have been raucous cheering at these moments.

GODZILLA is not a great film at all, but it's probably the best Godzilla film since the first one (with maybe the exception of 2004's Toho-created GODZILLA: FINAL WARS, which is pretty awesome).",1405296000,4,4941,4.73953488372093
5955710,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Really weak script, and bizarre directorial decisions mar the experience for me.  The movie never makes you to care about the human characters involved, the plot takes too many inexplicable (even for a Godzilla movie) turns, that defy even the most basic logic. Plus, :::SPOILERS::: the director chooses to show you a kid sleeping on a couch, instead of the first Godzilla fight. Which, if you like watching kids sleep on couches while their mothers yell at them is great.  But if you're a Godzilla fan, it was puzzling.

Some people said the movie was building tension...however, that would require tension.  I never felt for the human characters, and we've all seen Godzilla so many times there's no impact seeing him again for the ""first"" time. So disguising shoddy directorial choices with ""tension building"" doesn't really fly for me.  By the end I was so bored I didn't even care about the movie's climax...I was just ready to take a nap.",1405296000,20,944,4.838509316770186

Although I have yet to see this METALPAK, I offer my comments only on the film. I went into the film with NO expectations, I came out pleasantly surprised and at times AMAZED at some of the visuals. Although the story itself is really nothing new (it is really just a variation of the recent excellent GAMERA, Guardian of the Universe) - the overall film itself is briskly paced until the big MONSTER showdown at the end. Truly an EPIC film that needs to be seen on the big screen, as many of the shots are composed to show the massive scale of each monster, and the 3-D works amazingly well. The story is smartly constructed, as Cranston's more methodic and restrained personna steps aside halfway through the film to introduce his more action-oriented son. As for Godzilla himself, truly EPIC in every way, handled with respect, artistic flair and a real sense of DREAD. Overall, feels like more of the more traditional 1960's TOHO films.

5955719,2,B00EXPOCXY,"""Let them fight"" is the advice that one of the characters in this film gives, referring to Godzilla and the MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms).  It's too bad that the film-makers didn't pay attention to that admonition.

By this I mean, I went to see this movie expecting to see, well, a monster movie.  I'd seen a number of Godzilla movies in my childhood and they all followed the same, satisfying pattern...namely, they showed the monsters fighting against humans and then fighting against Godzilla.  There was mass destruction (usually in Tokyo) and we get to see lots of things blowing up and getting stomped on.

But this version of ""Godzilla"" stints on this essential component of monster movies.  It focuses far too much on totally forgettable  human characters.  The monsters are often times just glimpsed at.  For example, even though the monsters make appearances in Honolulu, Las Vegas, ad San Francisco, we only get to see any sustained destruction in the last.

Another problem is ..

<spoilers>

The movie makes you think that Bryan Cranston plays a leading role in it (just watch the various trailers).  But they kill his character off before the movie is a third over.  And the ""star"" is Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays a bland, cliched character with the verve of the lead of a high school play (a small high school).

<end spoilers>

The movie isn't a total loss.  The monsters are impressive, although Godzilla has something of a ""beer gut.""  And the special effects of the monsters rampaging are pretty impressive ... when the film makers aren't cutting away to show us the antics of various, zero-charisma actors and actresses.

But overall, it was a let-down.",1404864000,10,1697,4.953900709219858
5955720,4,B00EXPOCXY,"It was good. Not amazing but... It depends. Are you

5955721,1,B00EXPOCXY,"If you go into this movie expecting to see Godzilla destroy the city and fight off the monsters, well, you should look for that in other places. Here you will find 2 hours of Aaron Taylor-Johnson running around the city interacting with brick wall characters in a monotone voice. Once you get over the fact he's making the same face in every one of his scenes, you'll start to wonder where Godzilla is.

Before I answer your thoughts, let me comment on Bryan Cranston. He's not in it for as long as you may be expecting, in fact you could even say he's not in a Godzilla movie. However, for the short time he's on screen the movie flows very well. He's a relatable and emotionally attachable character. You care for his cause, and want to see him succeed. But just when things are getting good, he's gone.

Now you're REALLY trying to figure out where Godzilla is. An hour later, literally an hour into the film you finally, FINALLY catch a glimpse of Godzilla. It's truly something else. But it doesn't last long. Understandable, they are simply teasing him. Only this happens about 15 other times throughout the course of the movie. Whenever you think something exciting is going to happen, they simply switch back to Kickass and force his story down your throat.

Things start ramping up, as the end of the movie grows near. This is it. The final fight. Nope. Back to Kickass, occasionally with a glimpse of Godzilla punching a MUTO (the enemy in this movie that has double or even triple the screen time of Godzilla). Their is however 2 very, VERY short seconds that are extremely incredible to witness. I won't say exactly what, but think blue.

Also that's how you're going to feel after watching this movie. Blue. You'll wonder why you spent 2 hours watching Kickass run around a city. Wait until it's released and watch the end fight on Youtube. It will only be about 3 minutes long, but you'll get a much more enjoyable experience out of that then sitting through the entirety of Godzilla (2014).",1404777600,33,2005,4.607843137254902

5955723,4,B00EXPOCXY,"So, Im finally getting around to writing a review for Godzilla.  I don't know why I kept putting it off.  I was genuinely inspired to write upon leaving the theater, and Ive since talked about this an awful lot with a wide range of people (some who have seen it, some who have not, some who loved it, some who did not) and so its not like I haven't had the opportunity to throw all my thoughts down on paper (or up on the screen) and yet for some reason I kept finding myself preoccupied.

Like you really care.

Anyways, I will admit to being really torn when even considering seeing this movie, for more than one reason.  First, I still remember how much money I wasted seeing the 1998 film version of Godzilla in the theaters nearly ten times (like I can remember the exact count, but it was high) and so the idea of shelling out money for yet another rip on the creature was hard to bring myself to do.  While my teenage self was a huge fan of the Jurassic Park unleashed on the Big Apple version provided by Roland Emmerich, I have to say that the film has not aged well.  It was a corny and ridiculous attempt to blow things up and deliver a slew of cheap thrills and cheap jokes to entertain very few brain cells.  I was afraid that that was how this remake was going to go.

But the cast was inspired, and the director previously directed a film that was so far removed from anything explosive (Monsters simply sat there) that I was intrigued to see how they would fare in the subject.

But then the reviews started to trickle in and word of mouth was spreading that this was the greatest monster movie to come our way in ages and the hype was growing so large and those trailers were so impressive (no promotional campaign has been this on point and this effective in recent memory) that my mind was racing as to how big this was actually going to fail for me.  I mean, you cant live up to that kind of hype, right?

Wrong.

No, Godzilla doesnt deliver the way that Gravity did last year (and with the same kind of hype) but it does deliver, in a very large way.

Now, Ill get the big detractor (for some, not all) out of the way.  For a film entitled Godzilla, you see very little of him.  This doesnt matter when his presence is so extremely well done and orchestrated and his essence is felt all over every frame.  I mean, I never missed him because I could feel him the whole time.

Sadly, some don't share these sentiments.

Thankfully, most do.

For me, Gareth Edwards Godzilla is a prime example of the truth behind the belief that it isn't always the story being told, but the way you are telling the story that matters.  The whole Godzilla concept isn't a very deep one on paper.  I mean, it could be (and by God, the 1956 original really tried to be) but for the most part it feels like a halfway thought out Michael Crichton novel.  The actions of certain individuals, stereotypical to a T, can become rather redundant and almost laughable in the wrong hands.  In fact, on paper, Godzilla feels kind of like a failure.  But, in the hands of Edwards and his cast, the film is anything but.

The way that Edwards milks each frame for the prime amount of suspense was incredible.  For a beast that is rarely shown, his presence shook down beneath, above and around you always.  A lot of this is due to the tremendous use of sound, which almost caused my whole body to shake in parts, and the cinematography, which was pitch perfect (that bridge sequence is unforgettable and truly gripping because of it).  For me, the restraint used in giving us everything was a true blessing for a film that could have been just another Hollywood blockbuster.

True, most of this cast is wasted, and I can hear the complaints and even agree with them to a degree.  With names like Watanabe, Strathairn, Hawkins and Binoche attached (all previous Oscar nominees and winners) youd expect Edwards to have used them more within the body of his film, but instead the only true human elements come from Bryan Cranston (in a tremendous performance) and Elizabeth Olsen.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson carries the film, but hes also rather vacant and not a very convincing hero.  Like I said, I get these complaints.  But for me, the film still succeeds in making these characters feel real, despite their limited resources.  Cranston in particular grounds this film so well in his scenes that you find yourself forever drawn to his characters plight, and even when he delves into clich&eacute;d monster movie tantrums, he feels richly human.

But like I said, this film is oddly not about the humans and not really about the monster but about the atmosphere that Gareth Edwards has created, and what incredible atmosphere it is!

I was also really impressed with the integrity that Edwards gave the monster himself and the way that he preserved and essentially returned to the original concept, one that had been lost with all those remakes and ill-advised reincarnations.  Godzilla looks and feels classic, yet has so much modern edge that this feels like a very smartly updated homage to a beloved creature.

Terrible over-acting.  They kill off Juliet Binoche in the first 15 minutes and she was the best actor in this corny Japanese-type sci-fi.

5955728,3,B00EXPOCXY,"certainly diverting as a show, but not compelling.  he does take quite a while to make an appearance, but the real problem with that is that in spite of the fact that most of that time is spent with humans trying to figure out which way is up, the audience never really gets attached to anyone in any meaningful sense. so as they disappear, there's not much really tragic about it. It doesn't really tug at your emotions especially as the best actors die off pretty quickly indeed. But, if you are going to spend that much quality time waiting to bring on the monsters, you really need to do something with the people, and they had some very good actors to rely on. Use them or lose them and bring on the monsters and break out the popcorn.

As ancient organic life forms, the Mutos just didn't make a lot of sense to me. They certainly don't look very life like or truly scary. Who would you really rather avoid in the dark, Mutos or Aliens? .and why in the world would any ancient life form develop some sort of EMP blast mechanism to fend off enemies?  Maybe if they were fighting a mechanical Godzilla way  back then or perhaps Transformers. well, did they offer an explanation in the film? Yes, they did, and it's ridiculous.

anyway, once the monsters do show up, humanity basically becomes irrelevant. no one can really do anything about the battle, any more than ants can affect a battle between elephants. so, whoever does win, (really, is anyone actually tense about that?), all humanity can do is just try to get along and hope for the best.

but, if you just want to see stuff blown up, fall down, get smashed etc. then this will do nicely.  it has a very high wow factor for sure. Godzilla himself is very nicely done.

They just concentrated on the destructions and mayhem. Nice to see another city like San Francisco get destroyed for a change instead of New York.

5955736,5,B00EXPOCXY,"My actual rating is 4.75/5

Might I say, this movie was stupendous! :) It was just what I wanted in a Godzilla film.

Of course there are naysayers who want ""more of Godzilla"" but this was an homage to Gojira 1954 which literally had like 15-20 minutes of Godzilla showtime. Anyways this movie had 50+ minutes of Godzilla showtime, which in my opinion is more than sufficient. On top of all that, this is the premier of a new era of Godzilla! I'm more than sure Godzilla PT. 2 will have more of Godzilla in it, just as the later Godzilla movies of the Showa series, Heisei series, and Millienium series of Godzilla did.

Some of the character development was a little weak which is my only gripe, honestly, I REALLY would've loved to see more Dr. Serizawa. That honestly would've made the movie a complete 100% instead of just a 96% in my book. I can understand why they **SPOILER!!!!!!** killed a certain character, we as the audience would've expected this character to carry the movie through it's entirety instead of relying on the ""newer"" actor, Aaron Johnson, who didn't do horrible... but maybe should just stick to ""Kick-Ass"".

Last but not least, it wouldn't be a Godzilla review without reviewing the King himself right? Godzilla looks FANTASTIC in this adapation. On top of that he's HUGE, like WAY bigger than Godzilla from previous films. Also, if you read my caption, he has, what I would call, his original amazing roar (only modified/extended a little bit). I've got to say, the new Atomic Breath looks a bit like water... kind of? but it was still amazing to see his spines light up like a Christmas tree, in fact, the crowd cheered as soon as they saw it. My friend and I being the loudest amongst them.

To the naysayers, I just want to say, give this movie another chance. Watch it without the expectation of seeing fighting monsters the entire way through the movie, that's what Pacific Rim is for. It's meant to be serious in tone (see my previous comment about Gojira 1954).

Thanks for reading! I'll definitely be getting this on Blu-Ray as soon as it's available.",1403913600,59,2088,4.629729729729729
5955737,5,B00EXPOCXY,"In all honesty, this is the type of movie where you immediately recognize why some people would hate the movie, and why some people would love it. Then it's up to you to choose sides, based on what you've just watched. I believe this movie is one of the best that has ever depicted Godzilla, and it shows great respect for the monster and the franchise's recurring themes (in particular, the very first Godzilla movie). For me, I'm a little baffled at why the slow build up of Godzilla has caused people to give the movie such a low rating. I'm also not sure why so much focus was put on the minimal human drama in the film, as if they were expecting American Buffalo or something.

With that said, I think a lot of people are mistaking the actual merit of a motion picture with the stuff that they wanted in it. If Director Gareth Edwards wanted to, he could have very well easily shown Godzilla causing full-blown havoc right at the start of the film, and he could have also added some more melodrama among the cast. But as much of the audience might forget, this is not the typical 9-figure budget Hollywood film that's supposed to embody all elements of movie entertainment we've seen in theaters recently. What Edwards tried to go for was something much more original, where purposeful storytelling is emphasized over everything else. The movie never meanders too far into generic movie tropes, and we get is a unique work of art with a clear beginning and end.

Godzilla doesn't ever try too hard to breath its themes and ideas down our throats (no pun intended for those who watched the film). A lot of other CGI-heavy movies tend to spoon-feed its moral lessons and humor, the latter of which Godzilla has very sparingly throughout the film, and is mostly served visually rather than by dialogue. The only time the main underlying issue of humanity's ""scientific arrogance"" is ever directly brought up is in the beginning, and even then, it's not that explicitly discussed among the main characters. It's actually quite clever how the film pulls it off, since that environmental theme indirectly drives most of the plot, and yet it doesn't resort to any onscreen verbal scolding of our treatment of Earth. Instead, the scolding comes in the form of giant monsters wrecking havoc on our cities. That's definitely a positive for the movie, because it allows for story to progress smoothly without its own agenda hanging distractingly on its own head.

To be fair, I do agree with some critics who wanted more monster fighting. I don't have an issue with Godzilla fully appearing until about an hour into the movie, because that makes his presence much more startling and epic to see. But I would've enjoyed more frames of the fights between the MUTOs and Godzilla, and due to the pacing of the film, I don't think those extra frames would have taken away from the final bout towards the end. In fact, it's because that final fight was done so well that I recommend more monster action!

The human characters neither add or subtract from the film, but that's probably the point, to allow Edwards to emphasize Godzilla as its centerpiece. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays Navy Lieutenant Ford Brody, doesn't get many script opportunities to emote much, which is why you'll see lots of reviews that criticize his performance as being bland. The same goes for most of the cast, including Elizabeth Olsen, Ford's wife (granted, the screenplay really underuses her), and Ken Watanabe, whose casting will inevitably help drive box office numbers overseas. Not surprisingly, the highlight performance is Bryan Cranston's role as Ford's father. For Breaking Bad fans who are interested in watching the film because of Cranston's casting in the film, all I'll say is... don't get too distracted by his wig.

I strongly recommend watching this film, simply because it embodies an admirable focus on storytelling, something that is quite rare in big-budget Hollywood films these days. Forgoing typical blockbuster elements that merely serve as checkpoints to keep the audience interested, every moment in Godzilla purposely looks and feels authentically in the right place. Its ambitions as a serious, large-scale film is just as big as the 355-foot monster it respectfully heroizes. This is a film that, I believe, any movie-lover can enjoy.",1403654400,9,4335,4.876526458616011
5955738,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Let me add that this is the Godzilla the world was waiting for. This movies success is highly deserved in light of the fact that naysayers felt Godzilla needed to be changed for a modern audience-But then this film comes along and is respectful to Godzilla and his legacy and that goes to show-if it ain't broke , don't fix it. Some of the critics who felt there wasn't enough Godzilla are probably refering to the very first battle scene with Godzilla and Muto. They begin fighting for a split second and then they cut away. When we return the city is smouldered and we feel like we must have missed a lot! This was probably an attempt to keep the suspense up. This is a minor complaint as we get a lot of scenes with Godzilla. The film is enjoyable for fans and non-fans alike. I look forward to all the extras on this DVD.The best thing about this movie is that we are guaranteed 2 more G movies since this one was so successful.

5955740,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Great film, but given how much I liked Gareth Edwards' MONSTERS I had no doubt it would be good. It's a slow build and slow burn of a film, sort of how JAWS and ALIEN worked in the 70s. All the stories of ""not enough Godzilla""...naysayers- there is lots of Godzilla, but this comes from people who expect something ""special effecty"" in every frame of the film. Not a flawless film, and it was studio-edited meaning Edwards' cut of the film is actually 15 minutes longer including a scene cameo with Akira Takarada from the very first original Godzilla film,resulting in odd pacing here and there but on the whole, not a big problem.  I suspect this cut material will show up in a director's version or deleted scenes on the disk. The film never tries to make anyone forget the original 1954 Godzilla(which critics in 1956 complained ""not enough Godzilla"" in that one, to give you some perspective). The film less tries to re-capture the funerary feel of the original and more gives us something of the 1960s and even 70s Godzilla films to call back to. Worth your time.

5955741,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I'm not trying to ""bash"" anyone with this review, I'm simply speaking my point of view about the film.

I've seen this film twice in the theatre and I feel it's an awesome start to (I'm REALLY hoping) a new series. However, after hearing of  and reading some of the critic reviews, I also feel that some audiences have either forgotten or are unaware of who Godzilla is and what he represents. As a life long fan I know that the classic Godzilla films generally centered on his battles and (usually) victory over another monster. I'm all for monster vs. monster, but Godzilla isn't a superhero, he's a warning about (if I recall correctly) the consequences of what may happen if mankind ""toys with nature"" so to speak.",1403481600,10,718,4.6015625
5955742,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Theres a scene early on in GODZILLA in which Bryan Cranstons character, Joe Brody, has to make the fateful choice to close the blast doors that will keep a reactor leak at baywith his wife still in the reactor. His wife, Sandra Brody, played by the amazing French actress Juliette Binoche, works with him at the Janjira power plant in Japan. Joe, begging, pleading for Sandra to hurry back, closes the doors, screaming in anguish when she doesnt make it back in timeshes stopped to help a fellow worker back up after he falls, the trembling walls around them only slowing them down. Joe leans against the side of the door and cries, blaming himself, the love of his life gone. But then a quiet knock rings out, tender almost. Shes at the door, looking at Joe through a small porthole. Radioactive gas surrounds her, and we know that she won't last five minutes, even with the suit. Joe walks towards the window and Sandra looks back at him, taking her suits gas mask off. She knows shes dead anyway. ""I'm sorry,"" Joe says, Cranston inflicting every amount of pain and emotion he can muster into the line. Tears run down Joes cheeks and the second set of blast doors begins to close, blocking off the window. The last we see of Sandra, shes smiling back at her husbandas if she wants the last time he sees her to be of her smiling. The final set of steel doors close, lock. Cranston leans his head on them and weeps.

Its a powerful moment, and the sold-out, IMAX 3D audience I watched it with sat in stunned silence throughout it. Weve been trained not to expect scenes like the one above in a summer blockbuster that features CGI monsters knocking each other out, and the audience reacted accordinglyI don't think many were expecting to be tearing up in a movie called GODZILLA. As the doors closed on Juliette Binoche someone behind me whispered Daaaaaang, and thats when I knew director Gareth Edwards, arguably the next Steven Spielberg, had delivered with his sophomore film. His first film, Monsters, was an indie flick made for half a million dollars. That Legendary Studios and Warner Brothers believed in him enough to give him 160 million for this one says a lot.

It helps that Edwards clearly respects what came before: GODZILLA contains Jurassic Park references (a bus driver wipes the fog from his windshield to see Godzilla just like Malcolm does to see the Tyrannosaur), Jaws references (his spines cut through the water in extended shots just like the sharks fin; the BRODY family), Close Encounters of the Third Kind references (Cranston sneaks into a military site, nobody believes his wild theories); theres even a Mothra reference. What helps even more is that Edwards fills the film with talent: the aforementioned Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche give what could quite possibly be the best performances in a monster film ever; Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins plays scientists studying Godzilla; Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play a husband and wife torn apart by the monsters destruction. It helps that every single one of these actors have been in acclaimed indie movies before, for none of them act like they're in a dumb summer movie. Instead, all treat the material like they were in a smaller, more personal film, an edict Edwards himself personally told Cranston and Binoche to follow. This elevates the film immensely, making the film more about the Brody family then Godzilla himself. (Herself?)

When Godzilla does show up though, its glorious. Complete with motion-capture effects by the brilliant Andy Serkis (who played Gollum in the LOTR trilogy and Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes) Godzilla lives and breathes like a real creature we empathize with, feel for. Hes bigger and meaner than ever before, but at the same time the movie makes him our savior. Hes only here to restore balance, and the film makes it a point to show that hes not out to directly cause harm to mankind. He causes a tsunami simply rising up out of Waikiki Beach, killing hundreds if not thousands in its wake, but its only to fight off another monster: a winged M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestial Organism) currently wreaking havoc across Hawaii. Later on his spines shield a bus full of children from some stray missiles carelessly launched by a panicked Navy cruiser.

Though the trailers are a bit misleadingdespite what they make you think, its Taylor-Johnson who carries the film, not CranstonJohnson carries the film superbly. Many reviews have criticized Johnson for being flat or unemotive; its simply not true. Hes a soldier, hes trained to act that waytake it from someone whos not only worked at a Air Base for two years, but someone whos dated a girl leaving for the Air Force and is best friends with a current Army soldier. When Johnson is suited up and with gear, he acts exactly like a soldier should. He gets a couple nice scenes with his wife and son early on too, and there he doesnt act like a soldier, he acts like a husband and father. He laughs with his son. He tells stories with his wife. He emotes perfectly fine.

Even when the film does slow down a bit with several scenes of exposition, perfectly fine is still an able description of it. At its best its applause-worthy though, and my audience burst into applause several times at key moments. Those key moments are worthy of the biggest screen you can find; when Edwards finally cuts loose and lets the monsters rumble, nothing can prepare you for the amount of awe-inducing shots. Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey crafts some of the best wide shots Ive ever seen before, Edwards and Editor Bob Ducsay keep the cuts to a minimum and give us several extended tracking shots of sheer mayhem, and Alexandre Desplat gives the film a booming, awesome score worthy of the King of Monsters. Akira Ifukubes classic Gojira theme is missing, but Desplat makes sure you never actually miss it. If theres anything to miss, its Olsen herselfoutside of some brief scenes running away from monsters, shes not given nearly as much to do as everyone else. At times it feels like her runtime was cut, but its not detrimental to the movie as a whole.

Still, Godzilla is given plenty of screentime. Many have also complained that the titular creature merely cameos; those that complain must subscribe to the Michael Bay school of thought that explosions and action must carry on for hours on end. What Edwards has done here gives us a more thoughtful, slow-burn monster movie that builds to a fantastic climax, and it does pay off much better than any Transformers movie ever has. Think of it this way: in the original 1954 Godzilla, he only gets 17 minutes of screentime. Darth Vader is only in 12 minutes of A New Hope. The Joker is only in 33 minutes of the 152 minute The Dark Knight. Edwards Godzilla is only in about 20 minutes of the movie but like the above examples, it feels like a lot more.

At the end of the day its clear everyone behind this film wanted to make the best film possible, and it shows. The King is back, and long may he reign. Gareth Edwards is also here, and long may he reign too.

They focused too much on the humans. 98 was bad but the worst part was the story and relationships, they fixed this and made it more watchable than ever but at the same time, more interested in the monsters. There isn't alot of fighting, there is destruction but i would say there is more aftermath destruction than there is real-time. The final and only real battle is near the end and it is an amazing one that sheds light on how Godzilla should be portrayed the good ol' king of monsters that saves the day.

5955744,1,B00EXPOCXY,"SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!
The theatrical trailer for Godzilla 2014 would have us believe that a special team of combatants is doing a HALO jump from an aircraft into San Francisco to battle everyone's favorite giant, atomic irradiated lizard! WRONG!
They're jumping in because the nasty MUTO's (more on them later...) have spoiled everyone's plans by taking away one of their nuclear missiles, and are using it as a chew toy. The men have to go in and try to retrieve the nuclear devise.
Baaaaddddd. MUTO's!  Baaaaaddddd movie!

You see the poster, you see the title and you think, ""Well, we'll finally will get to see a GOOD American Godzilla movie!
WRONG!
What we're seeing is the collaborators ""vision"" and commentary on the wickedness of human-built nuclear devices, and the destruction we've brought upon ourselves. (with about 10 minutes of Godzilla thrown in, as an afterthought...)
Fine. There's plenty of great movies about the dangers and consequences of atomic/nuclear energy: the original 1954 GOJIRA, THE CHINA SYNDROME, ON THE BEACH, THE DAY AFTER , TESTAMENT, THE QUIET EARTH, etc. The difference is, those films send a message, AND still remain entertaining.

Bottom line: this film DOES NOT deliver the goods. I haven't been this disappointed, since I saw the second Daniel Craig /James Bond film, QUANTUM OF SOLACE. You go in with expectations, and you come out morose, depressed or even pi**ed off. I should emphasize: THIS MOVIE HAS NO SENSE OF FUN. Zilch. Totally humorless. Even the original 1954 GOJIRA has some humerous lines in it. (Go back and check it -you'll see.) This one is relentlessly depressing.

As a final word, go back and check out Roland Emmerich's 1998 Godzilla, again. The movie has been universally trashed over the years, but I think you'll find that if you give it a second viewing, at the very least you'll realize that Mr. Emmerich did indeed, DELIVER THE GOODS!",1402790400,12,1912,5.00314465408805

This movie gave me exactly what I would want as a Godzilla fan growing up in the CG world of today. The graphics were absolutely incredible! Godzilla looked ""beautiful"" in my opinion. Most complain that there wasn't ""enough"" Godzilla shown... and to a point I can agree, however, I do not think that ACTION ACTION OMG AAAAAACTION was the purpose for this movie, nor ANY Godzilla movie TOHO has put out.... So I expected that. Too much Godzilla = every other action movie.... Please not again.... I loved the amount of action that was shown, because when it happened, it was absolutely EPIC! Tops all other monster fights in film history, in my opinion. About the acting... I really don't see what all the complaints were about... I am not an actor critic... so maybe I'm just oblivious to this, but I had zero complaints about the acting. I thought each character played their individual roles fine. One of my favorite aspects of the movie was that it had ONE curse word!! Just one. I'd take my 4 or 5 year old to see this any day!

It is over-dramatic, and people drop like flies, and there is a lot of destruction. Woohoo!

Truthfully, I believe the naysayers are a little too into the overall culture and are being picky- this has a large budget, and they made Godzilla king- which is how it should be. The effects are amazing, the actors are good, and there is a fun suspense through the first 2/3 of it.

Spoiler Alert for the entire review

The marketing campaign for Godzilla was an outrageous bait and switch deal, leading us to believe we were going to treated to allot of Brian Cranston, Juliette Binoche and Godzilla.  I had high expectations.

The bad

Brian Cranston is great but too little screen time -  His part should have been written into the whole film. He could have carried it. My heart sank when he was offed so early. I knew we were in trouble.

Juliette Binoche  - Awesome actress, but who could tell, as she was offed even sooner then Cranston.

All other human characters - very bland acting, dull dialogue and stereo types. A real who cares cast of characters. Tedious.

To much of the MUTO monsters, who didn't look organic, were ungainly, ugly, unconvincing and had no personality. The MUTOs conducted themselves much like the superior looking Cloverfield monster only the MUTO monsters were black and had beaks.  Who cares about them - we want Godzilla!  We want Godzilla!

Plot/script - meandering dull, derivative, cliched and made little sense most of the time. Another who cares!

Credibility factor - Very low. Contrived cliff hanger scenes and little to no speculation, explanation or theory behind Godzilla, his history or origin.  Godzilla just seems to show up and is accepted. No one flips out.  I would, wouldn't you?

Godzilla - He is a likable guy, earth saving, and a monster destroyer, more in-tuned to the Godzilla kiddie movies. I would have preferred the humans at war with the nasty destructive Godzilla closer to the original Japanese 1954 film.  Although  I did like that Godzilla saved the folks on the bridge by shielding them from the navy's missiles and then holding the massive cable. Maybe I do like him as a big lug. But there is far too little Godzilla and only sporadically, far too late in the film. Godzilla may be the center piece of the movie's title but not the film.

The Good

Cranston and Binoche - great but sadly - gone far too soon.

Godzilla - Loved his looks - Godzilla appeared  organic, believable, massive, very big.  Excellent loud roar keeping in tune with the original Japanese film.  This Godzilla had personality.  Arguably this is the best looking, sounding and most real Godzilla ever.

Point of view film technique - Seeing the monster action only from the actors point's of view was cool once you caught on to it. Which for me, was a little too late. I liked it.

Holding back - I prefer films that hold back on the monsters instead of showing them right up front.  I'm glad they tried this technique and it partially worked.  But Godzilla was held back in spades. Therefore we were stuck with over an hours worth of dull plot, the MUTOs and uninteresting characters.

Special Effects - The entire  golden gate bridge scene, the tsunami wave in Hawaii, A jet fighter clipping one of Godzilla's plates, the airport plane crash, the navy awash on Godzilla's spines, A monster fight in San Fransisco and a few other short spectacular scenes with Godzilla were the awesome-est. But - too little and too late in the film.  Theses spectacular scenes were maybe the only reason to see the film.  There will be allot of fast-forwarding on the DVD release.

Finally

Godzilla saved the world but did he save the film?

I have a great fondness for the original 1954 Japanese Godzilla film but not the slew of subsequent Godzilla kiddie shows. The original Godzilla film was appropriately moody, well scripted and paced, had pathos, consistently good acting, a fair amount of logic and actually conveyed a deep, obvious meaning in its anti-nuke message. Many of qualities lacking in the new Godzilla film.

That said I liked the look and sound of this new Godzilla. I like what the effects people can now do with this big boy. There were a number of jaw dropping scenes. There were memorable scenes that stay with after you see the movie. The film left me with a sense of wanting to see more of Godzilla, maybe in a better movie. There were also allot of problems with the film - pacing, plot, script, acting etc.  Yet,in my opinion, I think Godzilla did rescue what was an otherwise fairly dull film so I can recommend this Godzilla to very forgiving sci-fi and giant monster fans -  but with many reservations.",1402099200,13,4281,4.718328840970351
5955755,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I stayed away from all but the first trailers for this movie so that I'd still be surprised throughout. Though, I think I still managed to hype myself up a bit too much by watching ALL of the other Godzilla movies in the few months before this released. Watching all of the movies was a good thing because while I was not blown away by this movies there are still worse entries in the series. Most people complain that Godzilla isn't in the film that much but I'm actually okay with that factor. Here are some pros and cons.

Pros
+CGI is great
+Brian Cranston is great
+Mutos and Muto..um.. egg (?) have good designs
+Kept Godzilla Godzilla (basically)
+Backstory on Mutos is pretty good
+Dr. Serizawa says Gojira
+Little References to other Godzilla films (many for mothra)
+Acting is good for the script

Cons
-Brian Cranston film time
-Too Many Kids (Ford as a kid and Ford's kid are fine, but random Asian kid?)
-Writer seems to think main characters need to be around every important scene with monsters
-Battle teases
-No long city destruction scenes
-The story is essentially Ford is trying to get back to his Family
-Too many close up on monster faces not enough wide shots to show their good designs
-Military sends in jets after they already know muto has emp powers (even the tv news simulation showed this)

Not the best Godzilla film. Also, not the best action film. But if you're a fan of either it won't hurt to give this movie a try.",1402012800,18,1450,4.526717557251908
5955756,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Overrated, don't take into consideration the high score that rottentomatoes gives to its movies. Most of the times it doesn't make sense. It wouldn't be that mediocre if I hadn't really high expectations from the high tomatoscore and if I hadn't compared it with PACIFIC RIM. There is a huge gap between the two and no matter what ,you inevitably have to compare the two. Godzilla loses in all points by far!!! It was maybe the weakest blockbuster, high budget movie I saw the last two years.

The story is ok, after all its a Godzilla movie but as in all destruction movies the plots are simple and the characters plain which serve only in completing the story, not ruling the story. There was no cliffhangers  and after a while the whole movie seemed like clich. The first 30 minutes where ok. It went boring afterwards. Many times I thought that the first Godzilla was better than this one.

So if you have seen Pacific Rim you might like Godzilla but even if you leave the story and characters aside ( which in P.R are way better even if Bryan Cranston is great in his part) the images, fights, monsters and the whole directorial skills are just amazing in Pacific Rim. There is no comparison. It's like comparing aliens to species, or the titanic to Poseidon!! Yes the difference is that big. de toro should direct the boring Hobbit movie.
 If you haven't seen Pacific Rim just watch and compare",1401840000,7,1400,4.588
5955757,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I can say that judging from the trailer I expected more.. Maybe something more along the lines of a Cloverfield...but this movie is just too unfocused. The movie was called Godzilla but they focused on everything but. Godzilla felt like a guest star in his own movie. This movie needed some serious tightening up, the script was a mess from top to bottom (did they PLAN for Godzilla to just ""runaway"" after defeating the two generic looking creatures? Why would you assume that?)  In the end this is just another creature feature with good effects, unbelievably good sound design, this movie will win an award for sound, and the usual underdeveloped characters that nobody really cares about. In short, I'm glad I spent the afternoon with a good friend in an air-conditioned theater, on the other hand I could never recommend this movie to anyone.",1401753600,4,847,4.841379310344828
5955758,4,B00EXPOCXY,"When this was ready to hit the theaters I revisited director Gareth Edwards' previous movie ""Monsters"" and I liked it a lot. I found a more thoughtful outing than one might expect given the subject matter. I found that same sensibility at work here and I liked it.

Here's the scoop. A mining company in the Philippines finds an open cavern with a huge skeleton in it and a couple of viable eggs. The eggs hatch a couple of monsters bent on destroying Godzilla. Said monsters cause the destruction of a nuclear power plant and the subsequent death of Brian Cranston's wife. The world is told it was an earthquake. Cranston thinks not and attempts to expose the cover-up. But it's getting too late as the monsters converge on San Fransisco where mayhem ensues.

Most directors would have gone for the jugular with this. Last second saves. Nail-biting this and that. In your face destruction and God knows what else. Edwards worked for a smarter movie. He built an actual plot with a fair amount of complexity. The monster fight scenes are filmed well and the ensuing destruction is a bi-product of the fighting. He didn't feel the need to jam it down the viewers' throats. He also filmed the monsters well. Sometimes in the dark or shrouded in smoke or dust. It gave the proceedings an eerie quality. I also liked the fact you didn't see the monsters right away. IMHO had they let the cat out of the bag right away there would have been too much fighting and mayhem and the time to develop the story would have been cut.

I did see nods to other films. ""Cloverfield"" and ""Pacific Rim"" are the most obvious but also ""Aliens"" with the whole 'mother/offspring' subtext. Most of the acting is good,(some not so) but all the production values are top shelf and the effects are about as impressive as they come.

Some, no doubt, will be upset with this because of the lack of sensationalism and not enough screen time for the monsters, but for my dollar this will hold up under repeat viewings. I consider it more of a thinking person's monster movie.",1401667200,9,2044,4.5917808219178085
5955759,4,B00EXPOCXY,"As a kid, I spent a lot of time at the movies. Heck, as an adult, I spend a lot of time at the movies. But I digress. Because of these hours spent in front of a flickering screen, I have fond memories of many silver screen icons. James Bond is a favorite and because I grew up during the Roger Moore era, he is MY James Bond, although I agree Sean Connery is the best. I also love a good scary film, good being the keyword. When a horror film takes obscene pleasure in sharing every gory detail, the filmmakers are robbing the viewer of a necessary element to make these films truly scary. Leave something for the viewer to interpret and their imagination will come up with something far better than the director can. I grew up watching films like Psycho, The Haunting and the original Halloween, so these films will always be better. I also grew up with Ray Harryhausen films, so when a new version of one of these films is made for the sole reason to use computer-generated effects in place of his meticulously crafted work, it leaves me cold. And I watched a lot of cheesy monster films. Godzilla films are a favorite, the cheesier the better. And they got pretty bad before the series ended.

I am also an outspoken critic of all of the unnecessary remakes Hollywood perpetuates on us. Why remake a classic? You aren't going to improve on the original. It is a CLASSIC for a reason. There is no way anyone will make Hitchcocks Psycho better, yet they try, and fail. Buster Keatons Seven Chances? Try. Fail. Why open yourself up to unfavorable criticism? If you absolutely have to tell the story, make some minor changes and rename it. This is how the majority of films are made anyway.

The Godzilla films are not classics because of their quality. They are classics because millions of kids revel in their cheesiness. Then, when they grow up, they have fond memories of the experience. Much like my fond memories of watching Roger Moore as James Bond. So, the Godzilla movies seem more ripe for a remake; better special effects and other filmmaking tools can only improve it. Right? But even here, you run the risk of alienating all of the grown men who reveled in the cheesiosity of these films as a kid. If your remake is too good, you will upset the people who still expect to see Godzilla portrayed by a guy stomping around in a rubber suit.

Even though I love the originals, I am ready for a good remake. Roland Emmerichs 1998 edition, featuring Matthew Broderick, held some promise. But it failed.

Last year, Guillermo del Toro made Pacific Rim combining many elements of the monster films with elements of the Giant Robot genre. It was AWESOME, but it didn't do great business, giving Warner Bros. some pause. The new Godzilla was already in the works, scheduled for release this summer.

They didn't need to worry. Godzilla (2014) had one of the largest opening weekends of the year, surpassing Spider Man 2 and Captain America 2.

Directed by Gareth Edwards, the new Godzilla combines great special effects with better-than-average human performances and an involving story to become what will be one of the better films of the summer.

Edwards earned attention by creating an extremely low-budget monster film called, well, Monsters in 2010. The acclaim this film earned brought him to the attention of the producers of Godzilla. Naturally, they decided to let a guy whose previous film cost $800,000 direct a film that probably cost between $150 and $200 million. Makes sense, right? No wonder Hollywood studios are always in such dire straits. But in this case, it does work. Edwards brings a fine eye to the human characters and their dialogue, giving it a more realistic bent. There are still far too many instances of Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor Johnson staring pensively into the distance. Or of Elisabeth Olsen running from the fighting monsters only to reach safety in a BART station just as they roll over the street level buildings. And there are still moments of dialogue guaranteed to make people laugh  at one point, Watanabe watches Godzilla and other monsters fight. An army official asks him what they should do. Let them fight is his reply. Yes, they will destroy most of downtown San Francisco, but let them fight anyway. But based on the originals and the Emmerich remake, both of these could have been so much worse.

The best part of the film is the gojira. Edwards spends a lot of screen time before we actually see any monsters, helping to build the anticipation and tension. We see evidence of them, of their destruction, but it is a while before we see one of the MUTOs, large radioactively mutated organisms. And it is even longer before we see Godzilla. This is how all of the best monster films build anticipation and make the creature even more scary. When we don't see the creature in full, only get hints of them, our mind begins to fill in the blanks and make the creature even scarier. Love it or like it, the recent Cloverfield did this, and did it well, revealing the monster-in any true detail very late in the film. For a good 80 minutes, we only see the destruction the beast causes in New York as the human characters flee from it. In Godzilla, the beast isn't seen in full for a while, which also allows us more time to figure out, along with the humans, what he is trying to accomplish.
Also, because we first see the MUTOs, we spend time figuring out what they are up to before we even see Godzilla. Edwards is doing two things here, building our anticipation and giving a little nod to the many Godzilla sequels, Godzilla vs. Mothra and the like. This isn't just about Godzilla, it is about Godzilla battling other huge, radioactive beasts.

And when he does show up, and we see him in his full glory, it is pretty awesome. The first roar? Scary. Both are reminiscent of the first appearance of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. But Godzilla is bigger, a lot bigger, and much scarier.

I don't think any director intentionally sets out to create a film with less interesting human performances, but because of all of the stuff going on, it is extremely difficult to get realistic performances out of the humans. They seem too much like crackpots and crackpots don't seem realistic.

The film opens with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samurai, Inception) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins, Blue Jasmine, Happy-Go-Lucky) investigating a mining accident in the Philippines. Much of the time, Watanabe stares into space, thinking about what terrible thing could have caused this destruction while Hawkins chatters on about the similarities between this and that. Then, a few years later, in Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his wife, Sandra (Juliette Binoche), head to the nuclear plant he runs and she provides maintenance for. They have been receiving reports of tremors and Cranston (in a spoof-worthy toupee) begins to yell at his subordinates about shutting it down. An accident leads them to evacuate. Flash forward fourteen years and Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Kick-Ass) has returned home to Elle (Elizabeth Olsen, Martha Marcy May Marlene, the upcoming Avengers: Age of Ultron) and their son, Sam (Carson Bolde). Ford quickly receives a call and learns his father has been arrested for trespassing on the old nuclear plant site in Japan. Ford travels to Japan and bails his father out before helping him travel back to the quarantined city in which they lived. Before you can say MUTO, Ford is thrust into the hunt for the nuclear enhanced beasts and ends up in San Francisco just as Godzilla and the MUTOs battle it out.

The acting in Godzilla (2014) is better than you might expect. Cranston, in particular, manages to wrench a lot of emotion out of his character and we really feel like we get to know him and what motivates him to uncover the truth. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, taking a page from the Summer Blockbuster Hero Handbook, keeps thrusting his character back into the action, realizing Ford can help in this fight. He doesnt have a lot to say, again, pulled from the hero handbook and performances of people like Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenneger, but he is always willing to join the fight.

The other actors are less successful, because they have less to do.

And a film like Godzilla (2014) will never be able to completely escape its origins. This means that the dialogue will occasionally be overwrought and maybe even laughable. Thankfully, Edwards and his screenwriter Max Borenstein (the upcoming Seventh Son, which I thought has already been released) manage to avoid a lot of this. But if it were completely gone, would the film be as good? A certain number of ticket-buyers expect this type of thing. When one of the original Godzilla films you grew up with has Godzilla looking at the camera and sighing, you expect a certain amount of cheesiness in any update. At one point, someone asks Watanabes character what they should do, because three nuclear enhanced giant beasts are about to fight in downtown San Francisco, causing even more wreckage and havoc. His reply? Let them fight. Then, he almost seems to settle in for the show.

And you, dear reader, should also settle in for the show.",1401667200,5,9221,4.735825545171339
5955760,5,B00EXPOCXY,"I feel instead of a five star rating, which is the best I can put here, is not quite what I think. I believe this movie deserves a 4.5, but in this case I rounded up.

First things first, the bad stuff. The biggest complaints I've seen are shallow acting, and little Godzilla screen time. I feel this is a tad unfair, but let my explain in detail.

The acting: at scenes, yes, very shallow. The main character (Aaron-Taylor Johnson) at times does seem very shallow. His main purpose for fighting on and on is to try and get to (and save) his wife and child, yet at times it does feel like he forgets that purpose to simply be the main military lead of the film. All he really needed to do was show a tad more broad of a spectrum of emotion, and he would've been perfect.

In addition, when being cast along side Bryan Cranston, who sadly dies early on, to my disappointment, is unfair. Bryan's acting for his time in the film was incredible. It was packed with feeling and purpose. In this aspect, it vastly overshadows Aaron. Had they given him more screen time, I doubt people would have complained as much.

The military itself is basically useless other than to forward the plot to the monsters fighting, which, is almost classic to the older G films, so you can't fault it here. Godzilla is always (well, almost) invulnerable to the military.

Screen time: This bit irks me. People are so unappreciative of build up. All they go to see movies for is destroy this, destroy that, action, action, action, action, with very little story. Godzilla has more screen time than in the original 1954 film and packs a hell of a whallop for his screen time. Out of the two hour movie, he is on screen for about 20-30 minutes at most, in numbers, not too long given that the movie is about him. But what this movie does, is set a wondrous build up. It sets up a great story, explaining what the monsters are, what they are doing, why they are doing it, etc. But I feel people don't care about that and just bash it cause ""OMG why is Godzilla not constantly on the screen breaking things??"" As for showing Godzilla, it teases you slowly, then the final unleashing and fight scene, is INCREDIBLE. The movie gives little thumbs up to other movies (King Kong (debatable) and Jurassic Park) that helped influence it, which I thought was great

The good: Even with the long build up, if you are impatient, it is WELL worth it. Godzilla being on screen like he is in this movie has never done him more justice since 1998 (which, in my opinion wasn't too bad a movie either, just the monster wasn't really Godzilla). His initial showing was just heart pounding, and the scene where you see that eery blue glow just sent me into a cheer. This movie is the perfect set up for a sequel, which basically feels like its purpose, however this movie was still amazing, and well worth seeing.

In the end, I really don't see people's complaints justifiable (except maybe the acting), I really just feel that the people who complain are spoiled and went to see this movie expecting something different. You need to expect story, not just brainless action 24/7. Given, brainless action can be fun, but sometimes you need something to back it up. Godzilla delivers a good story, great build up, and an incredible ending. I've seen it 3 times in theaters, am going to see it again, and will for sure be buying whatever collector's edition they have, and seeing the sequel (which was confirmed the Sunday after it came out).

A must see for any Godzilla fan, and close to a must see for anyone who enjoys a good story and build up with a powerful delivery. If you are an action-only baby, then you still may enjoy the movie for the Godzilla parts but hate the rest of it. Nonetheless, I do recommend for everyone.",1401580800,13,3784,4.465991316931983

A natural disaster that isn't actually natural sparks off a chain of events which leads to a giant monster that could spell the end of the world for humanity.

What did I think?

The new Godzilla is like a one-night stand. Its fun and exciting while it lasts but the next morning you have questions and thoughts that are generally unsatisfying.

Great effects and the best finishing move of all time (OF ALL TIME) mask some deficiencies in characterisation and story. The main hero follows a journey of interconnected events that is beyond the belief of even someone whos happy to believe in giant monsters.

But for those who do, it isn't about the frailties of the script, its about the giant lizard. And although we don't see enough of the big guy what we do see is simply good fun. There are some good twists (avoid spoilers beforehand if you can) and some genuine respect and love for the character and its history but just don't think about it too much.",1401580800,5,976,4.554285714285714

5955763,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla is a difficult franchise and for a franchise that has been around for more than half a decade, it is to be expected.

You had 3 different eras of film plus a film that no one wants to talk about

You first have the Showa era, a series of films that is mostly known for it's camp humor and over the top goofy action (like Godzilla dancing)...while not really good film, people tend to think of these kinds of films when thinking of the franchise

Heisei Era was a more grounded series of movies, ones that tried to try to be more closer in tone with the original Godzilla film from 54 ignoring the Showa era of films...personally it is my favorite era

The millennium series is a mix bag by fans, as by it is also a bit of a mix bags of films..We even see Godzilla at what was essentially a Ju-on/Grudge spirit...it was weird

Now here is where expectations come from...some people wanted different things...some wanted Showa, some wanted Heisei, some wanted Millennium...and a couple of poor unfortunate souls wanted the 98 film sequel.

From alot of people, some wanted what they assumed the film was going to be was a Pacific Rim 2: Godzilla Boogalo movie - they wanted the movie to be more than half the film of just giant monsters...Even when Godzilla did it in the past, Final Wars was generally a terrible movie all around; even Godzilla vs Space Godzilla felt liked it dragged on for too long.

The first film of the Legendary Era of the franchise is it's own thing...it shouldn't be compared to the other 3 eras of films (just like the other era of films shouldn't be compared to one another). Though if I had a good description, it is like Heisei Godzilla meets Cloverfield

It's a good movie, a solid 7.5 out of ten, easily one of the best Godzilla movie in my opinion

The first time Godzilla  appears on screen is awesome, a great first entrance is key in these kind of movies.
 I really only have two gripes about this film. Bryan Cranston appeared as the main character in all of the movie trailers for this picture, and without spoiling any details of the story, let me tell you that he is not. Aaron Taylor Johnson is the lead character and he is okay as Ford in this movie, but Bryan was just so much better I really feel that they wasted his character. My second complaint is they didn't show quite enough Godzilla, they showed enough of him you don't feel dissatisfied, and they show PLENTY enough of the MUTOs so it makes up for the slight lack of Godzilla.
It is a great movie, don't let the complainers and cry-babies deter you away, they just like to nit-pick the movie apart. GREAT MOVIE!",1401494400,14,1007,4.467391304347826
5955765,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Back in 1954, director Hishiro Honda released Gojira and then two years later because of its success in 1956, it was re-released as Godzilla for American audiences (and world-wide) with subtitles and the insertion of an American character to help sell the tickets. It worked and Godzilla was born globally and spawned by 29 films since his first appearance in the 50s. The originals are still great fun to watch and have storys that hold up.

 This Godzilla film leaves much to be desired. Let me start with the best part of the film, the design and look of the 2014 Godzilla monster is very sleek and almost has an Anime design to it. Also, when the King of Monsters gets angry and lights up, it was an amazing combination of very precise CG and animation. In fact the last 20 minutes of the film make up for the first 90 minutes of the movie somewhat and are very interestingly choreographed between Godzilla and the two other mutant monsters bent on mating and reproducing while destroying San Francisco in the process.

 Now where the movie falls short? Story, realism for the suspension-of-disbelief and anyone to actually care about and nothing that screenwriter Max Borenstein could have done would have made it less boring. Its a good hour and fifteen minutes before even a hint of Godzilla is seen in full frame. It wasn't an exciting build up and it created no anticipation  in fact it was just plain boring.

 Even the amazing Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) as the miss-understood scientist and Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai, Inception) as the scientist studying monsters and only person to start understanding and supporting Godzillas efforts (surprise) couldn't save this film.

 There are two standout (at least notable) performances however are of note for me. David Strathairm (The Bourne Ultimatum, Lincoln) did a really nice job as the military Admiral doing what American military types do in these types of movies  shoot first  don't even bother to ask questions at any time. But he seems to present a side and edge that makes you think hes the first of the military types who eventually gets Godzilla and what he/she represents. (Im never quite clear about the gender of Godzilla.)

 Also, Aaron Taylor Johnson (Kick Ass, Savages) plays the older version of Cranston son who joins the military but sees his fathers insanity is really about a true phenomenon and learns that sometimes the unbelievable can be really true. Nice performance and sincerity in his delivery.

 Overall this is another good made-for-TV film but certainly lacks the stamina for any return views or long term conversations. Wait for NETFLIX or Blu-Ray on this one  but at least the Godzilla franchise is not dead. Please do yourself a favor and see the first four original films  and although they were cheaply made, they all had story and characters you were cheering and booing for!

The film not only scared me a bit, but it got me hooked on this massive creature and sure enough I was a Godzilla fan. So after seeing 1984 I saw the '98 film. Be reasonable, I was 6 years old at the time and to me the movie was good, as I grew I realize that the film was not Godzilla, just in-name only. So during the times of watching every Godzilla movie, playing games, I just thought when would we ever see the king again? There was many teases during the late Millenium, like in 2008 the IMAX Godzilla 3D To The Max which was never mentioned again. It wasn't until Comic-Con 2011 we got official word that Legendary was working on a new Godzilla film. Handing out T-Shirts to build up a 3 year hype which worked.

Well, was my 16 year wait a worth seeing Godzilla again on the big screen? Yes it was. I'll say this already, I do have my personal ""nit-picks"" on why I won't say this movie is perfect, mainly just seeing Godzilla just a tad bit more than I was expecting. But when you finally see him, you know things are gonna get serious. The human cast is okay, not Oscar worthy but for a traditional Godzilla film, it works. Though cut all ties to Bryan Cranston if you see the movie just for him, you'll thank me later. Luckily I never cared much for Heisenburg so I was unaffected. Really I go into this movie and expect to see a Godzilla film, and walk out getting almost everything I could ask for.

Like most Godzilla movies, there are monsters that Godzilla fights, and that's included. MUTO, Mobile Unidentified Terrestrial Organism, is the newest Godzilla Monster and you don't see one, you get two of them, a male and a female. And honestly, I've seen reviews saying how the MUTO looks ""unoriginal"" as if it was already done. Although I see it when people make comparisons with the Cloverfield monster. But in terms of Godzilla, it's quite fresh. The design could of been better in some cases, but my god, when has Godzilla ever have to fight two monsters of the same species that are just trying to reproduce? And the Male and Female MUTO are not look-a-likes, not at all. The Male is shorter yet has wings, The Female is the same size as Godzilla but is grounded. And this is probably one of the reasons why Godzilla is seen as a (SPOILER ALERT) Hero and not a Villain. Because the real threat in Godzilla was not Godzilla but the MUTO. At the same time, people quickly forget that these two beings were stated to exist in times where the Earth was covered in high levels of radiation where the creatures consumed it. My bet was Godzilla wasn't just fighting the MUTO just because it was a threat to the Earth, but because it was competition for it's food source. MUTO and Godzilla both feed on anything Radioactive and Nuclear material, and Mother Nature has shown that predatory animals that usually eat the same food source will fight each other, if not kill off future generations of the opposing species to be the ""Alpha Predator.""

With that said, I really enjoyed Godzilla, I felt like a kid again when I saw the movie. And there were some memorable parts that I would love to say, but there are just parts in movies you just gotta let people see in order for it to be okay to talk about. Like the ending, that I will not spoil, EVER. And for those that spoiled on how Godzilla (completely censored due to massive spoilers) then shame on you. Even if you didn't like the movie, that was probably the most unexpected thing to see Godzilla due. And I've seen Godzilla Fly in one of his movies and I would never of expected that ending blow to the MUTO. Which is still ""hush-hush."" I can not wait for the Blu-Ray to be released. I want to see it again. I may see it again in Theaters, but for now I can only wait once again.",1401235200,9,3883,4.33837689133425
5955767,5,B00EXPOCXY,"Finally America got Godzilla right,this movie was a true treat for any Godzilla fan.  The scope of Godzilla has never felt so epic and amazing every time we see him it's jaw dropping.  The movie is definitely inspired by and can be compared to Speilberg movies Jaws and Jurassic Park.  I have been a Godzilla fan since childhood it's huge obsession of mine and this lived up to all the hype it wasn't just a movie it was a movie going experience.",1401235200,7,446,4.414634146341464
5955768,4,B00EXPOCXY,"It has happened, and I will take the blame. Those crappy Asylum films with ""B"" actors, laughable scripts and idiotic special effects which I adore for the cheese has been mistaken as good cinema. The science in this film is bad. Oh I don't mean typical Godzilla feature bad, but one with less than a fifth grade understanding of the world and life.

First my science beefs: The beginning reactor scenario was inane. Reactors are in a containment. People do not venture into the containment when the reactor is at full power. I know we needed to kill some people off in the beginning, but there were far better ways.

Second science beef (there are many, I will just hit a few): No organism can ""feed"" off of ionizing radiation. It seems odd that Godzilla tends to destroy his food sources. Also if an organism did live off of radiation, the bottom of the ocean is the worse place to be. Go to Denver.

Is it only me that considers that flying Rodan thingy always a victim. Heck, we even gave Darth Vader a break.

The acting was bad. Bryan Cranston bobs around like a turd in a punch bowl. Serious? Bryan Cranston is all they could afford? Dig up Raymond Burr and prop him up like ""Weekend at Bernie's."" Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass) really didn't make it either.

Now if seeing Godzilla scares you, you are in luck as he mostly comes out at night and not that often.

Remember the 1998 film in surround sound? The rain was coming down. You could hear the footsteps of Godzilla approaching as the fear and tension vibrated through the speakers.

This film was a let down. X-Men time travel thing was better.

5955769,4,B00EXPOCXY,"First, the good things: Godzilla has learned from its predecessors to nail all the elements that King of All Monsters true to his origins. Hes big, he fights monsters, and yes he breathes radioactive flames. It seems Godzilla and other giant prehistoric beasts like him feed off radiation and emit electromagnetic pulses, which has the dual effect of making the monster modern and uniquely immune to modern tactics.

But this is a movie interested in going beyond Godzillas story to tell our own: through Hurricane Katrina, the Northeast Black Out of 2003, and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake/tsunami/Fukushima nuclear accident. Taken separately, any one of those mass horrors would be inconceivable. But now Godzilla seems comforting in comparison, a convenient scapegoat for why bad things happen to good people.

Godzilla humanizes the titular monster by bringing his presence down to human scale; forget his atomic breath, tidal waves wreak havoc when he steps out of the ocean. The Brody family is at the center of it all, first with atomic plant supervisor Joe (Bryan Cranston) and his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and then later with their adult son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), an explosive ordinance disposal officer. But we were watching the movie to see monsters fight, and after a long series of teases where Godzilla retreats into the massive debris clouds, we finally get some kaiju action.

Godzillas foe is a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) that has the aforementioned appetite and powers of a monster feeding off the radiation of the Earth deep below ground. This means that any nuclear weapon a tasty snack for pregnant MUTOs (theres a breeding pair) to consume, which makes them very interested in human affairs. What ensues is a game of nuclear football between the American military, the MUTOs, and Godzilla.

Along the way Ken Watanabe as Ishiro Sedrizawa stares cryptically into space while muttering about alpha predators and the natural world, the military fires uselessly at 300+ feet tall monsters, and two critters that look an awful lot like Cloverfield often pop up out of nowhere. There are moments where Godzilla stretches the bounds of the realistic terror it tries to impose -- like when an explosive ordinance disposal officer knows how to perform a HALO drop  but then we hear that Godzilla roar and all is forgiven.  This is a reboot worthy of the franchise.",1401235200,5,2409,5.11704834605598
5955770,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla, the 2014 version of the monster, was a flawless work of art. Godzilla, the 2014 version of the film franchise...not so much. Unlike the majority of the reviewers here, I don't think the small amount we see Godzilla is the biggest problem, but rather the problem is the lack of style prior to his arrival. The graphic elements in the opening credits set a stylish tone, which the smoke and light tricks in the finale fight segments make good on (much as the trailers tease of), but prior to that I think the film could have sorely used some grind-house flair. Maybe that would not jive with the desired PG-13 rating, but holding onto that rating forces this film to fight for kids attention alongside a slew of movies featuring a lot more giant robots and mutants smashing things. I can forgive the rating restriction though, but they needed more gripping performances, more artistic camera angles, etc. I can appreciate the style elements sprinkled in whenever they dealt with old-fashioned film clips, flashbacks, and print materials, but considering all the film-noir and poise involved in the depiction of Godzilla, the remaining 3/4 of the film felt drained of life. It's odd, because we start off by watching Bryan Cranston lumber around attempting to carry this whole movie himself, with a script that was rewritten and revised by numerous reputable writers, and the character is perfectly aligned with both the bumbling fool he played in Malcom in the Middle and the brilliant scientist side that was added to that foolish persona in Breaking Bad; Yet he can hardly get the baton passed-off to Godzilla in time. In fact, he misses that hand-off by about an hour (maybe more), in which we are stuck with a surprised scientist standing around among blinking lights and debris with his brow furrowed, and a seemingly random female scientist standing beside him. Yet, this film could hardly be called a failure, simply because the scenes of Godzilla in the city are just so darn gorgeous, and because Cranston at least gives a passable performance. All the characters lack depth, but it's well against my better judgement to recommend even ten more minutes of build-up in a movie which is surely not done disappointing those who are unable to reconcile their love of Godzilla with their undying urge to fall asleep halfway through this film. Judging by his performance in Inception, I have to say that Ken Watanabe was sorely underused, despite the fact that his character was supposed to be a symbolic cliche homage (to the original actor, who's cameo was removed from this 2014 version). The weakest link is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is thrust into the spotlight as the handsome lead, but comes off like Bradley Cooper trying to play Spiderman, and that is the strongest part of what he does. Watanabe and Taylor-Johnson spend more time standing around looking astonished than Mark Wahlberg (in every movie he ever made). Although this plot line could hardly be considered as meandering as Planet of the Apes, it could learn a lot from Rise of the Planet of the Apes, as far as what is needed in the first half of a film in which we know the plot, in order to most truly pull at our heart strings while we wait for beloved characters to rise up and fight. Although I totally expect this film team to do better on a sequel, they may lack the funding, because of a lack of viewership from those who lost faith after nodding out during this version. Too bad, considering the admirable detail, such as adding ocean birds lightly following and clinging to Godzilla as it returns to the sea. Riding home, I could easily picture Godzilla emerging from the foggy skyline, but I'm not quite sure if I could picture myself watching this again; too bad.",1401235200,21,3757,4.790446841294299
5955771,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Many directors in the past have been confused over what makes a good Godzilla film. They will do stupid things like actually show Godzilla, which is obviously not what the viewers want to see when going to a Godzilla film. This first-time feature-film director has crafted the perfect vision. He titles the film ""Godzilla"" and then masterfully hides the dinosaur from the film for almost the entire thing!

Many directors would give you a glimpse of Godzilla early on, but not in this case. It is exactly one hour into the film before you actually see Godzilla, and even then it is literally for three seconds before he is snatched from sight. The Mutos (the bad dinosaurs) are given more screen time than Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"", while the title character is forgotten. The director obviously feels that the best use of Godzilla is to actually NOT use him. Instead, we are given a lead actors that would make a Sci-Fi Channel film look good. Their emotional range goes from blank stares to soulless stares to horrified stares to outright crying and back again. Bryan Cranston has a cameo at the beginning of the film and actually has more screen time than the title character (I'm not joking here), so I don't know why they didn't name the film ""Cranston"".

And just to let us know that he COULD have made a good film, the director gives us exactly ten seconds of incredible Godzilla action at the end as he deals awesome death blows to the two Mutos. Those ten seconds are what you watched the entire film hoping it would be like, and the director beautifully flips the audience off by showing that he had the capability all along to make a great film, but chose instead to force feed you a steaming pile of crap for the past two hours and ten minutes.

So if you've been mistakenly watching Godzilla films to see dinosaurs fight, this director reminds you that it's the people running around in the miniature backgrounds that are actually important, not the big green guy. Will there be a sequel? Well, any disaster film you see from this point forward could be one, as you don't have to see Godzilla to know he's there. If you love this, go back and watch ""2012"", ""Earthquake"", or even ""Sharknado"" and listen for the familiar roar in the background.

5955774,4,B00EXPOCXY,"The character Godzilla reminds one of the great monster movies of yesteryear - King Kong, Dracula, etc. However, in 1998, a very bad Godzilla movie was made, and people just kind of forgot about the character. The brand-spankin-new 2014 Godzilla had to really deliver the goods to fans, without being completely illogical and strange. After all, this is one of the easiest film genres for a moviemaker to do - these big-budget action films seem to have a lot in common with one another, and creativity appears to be dead (Did you know Michael Bay is making ANOTHER Transformers movie?)

Gareth Edwards must have realized that he has a lot riding on this new Godzilla. Should it do well, it could become a franchise. Should it do horribly, it will be another Jack the Giant Slayer for Warner Bros. Translation - a big budget embarrassment that lost a ton of money. So it had to fall outside of the typical action-movie cliches. Fans might be happy initially, but critics will crucify the film and it won't be remembered in a positive light.

""Godzilla"" is strangely interested in the human-emotional aspect of the story, as opposed to when Godzilla finally destroys everything. Its great that this movie tried to incorporate some kind of real story amidst all of the destruction and mayhem.

Joe (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife (Juliette Binoche) in a weird, toxic-gas accident that he unwittingly put her into. Years later, he is a broken man who is obsessed with exposing a governmental conspiracy that he enlists his son, an Army Lieutenant (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to help him with. Before long, they look over a past event in the 1950s, the first appearance of the mythical Godzilla, and realize that before too long, Godzilla isn't the only monster that threatens them all.

Cranston gives an excellent performance, bringing lots of emotion and pathos to a role that didn't necessarily call for it. Johnson also proves that he is very comfortable in the role of the macho action hero, having become much more than the quirky kid from the Kick-Ass movies. His performance isn't quite as seasoned as Cranstons, but as an actor, hell get there.

Edwards does a good job making this a story that the audience can easily get into, and also does justice to the old Godzilla movies, getting the action moments where the madness of Godzilla is unleashed very right. However, a good portion of the mayhem here takes place in San Francisco, and the Golden Gate bridge doesnt get destroyed? In that aspect, I felt a bit ripped off. Otherwise, this reboot really works. It has a tacked-on ending that basically demands a sequel, which I will gladly go see.

5955775,3,B00EXPOCXY,"There's a reason Godzilla is known as the King of All Monsters, and it only has a little bit to do with his massive size. The creature has been around for six decades and starred in more than 28 movies, begun as a metaphor for the devastating effects of nuclear weaponry on Japan and the world. A movie like Pacific Rim doesn't exist without Godzilla inspiring the entire kaiju genre, but at its heart the early films were designed as cautionary horror tales. Gareth Edwards' modern update, because frankly nobody wants to remember the 1998 film, is also steeped in heavy warnings about nature's devastating power and the dire consequences if humans choose to ignore it. But it's also those humans and their actions that are left forgotten in the need to generate just another soulless blockbuster spectacle.

Sadly, the most colossal thing about Godzilla is how underwhelming it is, and perhaps my own expectations were inflated because of all the hype. I was there on the floor of Hall H when Edwards made the big Godzilla announcement and showed his early vision for the reboot, and the room was thick with the energy of anticipation. That excitement really never subsided thanks to a smart marketing strategy that kept the monster largely out of promos and trailers. The mystery is what mattered, and that tension over Godzilla's arrival is a large reason why the film works so well initially, yet is so disappointing once he appears.

The atomic era serves as sturdy ground for the story, penned by relative newcomer Max Borenstein (with a Frank Darabont assist), building on old fears of planet-killing nuclear destruction. Edwards uses stock footage from Hiroshima and other nuclear events, and later on uses many of these tragedies as a visual road map to the epic disasters he's capturing on screen. The film is at its best long before Godzilla ever enters the frame thanks to a superb cast adding such rich, emotional stakes one forgets this is supposed to be just another summer popcorn flick. Bryan Cranston is Joe Brody, a physicist struggling to get past the death of his wife fifteen years earlier when she was killed by an accident at a Japanese nuclear plant. Having lost his job, Joe has also lost the respect of his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who believes his father to be a total whack job obsessed with conspiracy theories that the Japanese government is hiding something big. The father/son dynamic is easily the best aspect of the story early on, with Cranston and Johnson playing off one another beautifully. Joe's haunted quest for the truth lends dramatic thrust to what is essentially a slow burn mystery. Ford, who now a husband, father, and soldier in the Ordinance Disposal unit (that'll come in handy later), is reluctantly dragged into exploring the quarantined zone where the original disaster occurred. There they discover a secret that threatens the world, and Ford learns that his dad wasn't a total nut job all these years.

From there all of the compelling emotional stakes and familial dynamics get roasted like they were caught in Godzilla's atomic fire. The typically-awesome Ken Watanabe doesn't do much but look bewildered as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, a scientist who has been studying these disasters for decades and knows the truth about them. Now he's working at a secret facility where cocooned radioactive energy-sapping creatures are being housed in secret, even though their mere presence screws with all electronics and threatens the whole planet. It's also just kind of stupid in general terms. When the creatures inevitably escape and cause all types of havoc, another monster awakens to combat them, with Serizawa hypothesizing it's nature's way of finding balance. Godzilla has often been portrayed as an avatar of Mother Earth, a protector of the planet, and the film works this aspect into the story seamlessly without going too far with it. Nobody wants to see Godzilla turned into Captain Planet or anything like that.

The humans scramble around to make their plans to stop all of the monsters walking (or flying) the earth, and as one might expect it involves nukes and lots of gunfire, things we know are never going to work. Meanwhile, Ford is bouncing from location to location trying to get back home to his family, but he's really sort of adrift without a whole lot to do. There comes a point where human focus leaves Joe and shifts to Ford, and the story never quite recovers from that. We have no emotional investment in ford other than his return home, while the long-held tension he had with Joe provided the greatest heft. Elizabeth Olsen is sorely wasted as Ford's wife, and the same can be said for other bit players Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. The amount of talent gone to waste here is phenomenal. As I said before, Godzilla movies all tend to leave their human characters in the background or relegate them to stock roles, and this is no different. Mostly the humans fumble around dumbfounded while the monsters cause wide scale disasters, and the whole thing just comes off as empty and pointless. We know it will be Godzilla who saves the day in the end, so where's the drama in everything that comes before that?

Poorly executed story aside, Godzilla is often the jaw-dropper we were always hoping it would be.  This is the first big movie by Edwards, who floored many with his small-budget creature feature, Monsters. That film was an immigration parable clearly inspired by Godzilla movies, and here he throws in a dose of Spielberg-ian wonder to much of the spectacle. The visuals are impressive and will have you geeking out over the awesome scale of it, especially the design of Godzilla himself. He looks great and there's an incredible level of detail in every movement. Edwards keeps him hidden in a thick haze of smoke, fog, and shadow until the time is just right for maximum impact. The way he builds tension is a thing of pure beauty.  Less impressive are the other monsters, called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Objects) which look hastily thrown together and rather generic. This severely hurts the monster clashes which never quite live up to the exhilarating display they ought to be.

There are good ideas here, and Edwards is a genuine talent and perhaps does the best with a modern Godzilla film than anybody could have hoped for. Godzilla as a character simply doesn't hold a lot of appeal outside of being a force of nature. He's awesome to look at and be in awe of but without human characters audiences can connect with, Godzilla might as well keep that mighty roar to himself.",1400976000,8,6619,4.8773333333333335
5955776,2,B00EXPOCXY,"As a movie character, Godzilla always seemed too imitative of his predecessors, notably King Kong (who had far more personality and craft) and a couple of Ray Harryhausen creations (which had more craft). Still, the 1954 Japanese original, distributed by Toho Enterprise and directed by Ishiro Honda, was an imposing manifestation of the H-Bomb. Grimness permeates the original, birthed from an authentic response to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and the 1954 nuclear tests in the Pacific (which had resulted in radiation sickness visited upon occupants of a Japanese freighter). The beast of nature brutally emerges, like a fevered dream, amidst raining soot and decimated fallout shelters, to take revenge upon mankind. Contemporary audiences may roll their eyes during some of the clunkier dialogue (i.e.the preachy finale) or squirm through dated FX, which do hold true to form. Horror films, more than any other genre, date quickly: but that hardly renders the original mere camp. The clicking newsreel footage, juxtaposed against the dramatic tensions between the four human characters, nearly banishes the preposterousness of it all. Predictably, American distributors demanded a dumber version tailored to Yank attention spans, which cannot handle much in the way of foreign narrative, let alone subtitles. The result, directed by perennial hack Terry Morse, cut out nearly an hour of footage and added an Americanized half hour with actor Raymond Burr, who in the role of reporter Steve Martin is awkwardly placed throughout the film, pointlessly narrating what we are already seeing. Worse, by muting the escalating human drama, Morse and company actually made the film a duller affair, robbing it of its gnawing pop power. Burr is simply too phlegmatic an actor for such surroundings, lacking the anxieties of Takashi Shimura (an Akira Kurosawa regular) and Momoko Kochi, or the haunting quality of Akihiko Hirata. Western audiences flocked to the bastardized version anyway, and, until a few years ago, when both versions were released on the Criterion Collection, most Americans were largely unaware of the Japanese original.

It was the success of the American Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1956), rather than Honda's Godzilla (1954, originally titled Gojira), which set the increasingly cartoonish pattern that followed. Honda, who had previously been an assistant to Akira Kurosawa, wrote the original film's screenplay and invested a stark sobriety into his absurd narrative. However, it was the American box office which dictated the remainder of Honda's output. By the third entry in the ongoing franchise, King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962), the big green lizard (still technically a villain) does battle with of one of his own influences. However, the guy in the rubber gorilla suit here looks more like an embarrassing reject from the Island of Misfit Toys than he does the titular hero of the 1933 classic. King Kong vs. Godzilla nearly serves as a new definition for ""execrable."" That, in itself, could prove entertaining, but the film fatally succumbs to unbearable dullness. Even the most hardcore Godzilla fundamentalists are pressed to defend this one, and it is almost shocking to find Honda directed it as well. While the original Godzilla isn't a certified classic, it is rousing pulp fare.

Within a few films, Godzilla morphed into a kind of jolly green giant, super-dino protector of Japan. Occasionally, the new genre injected fleetingly charming, idiosyncratic scenarios for the kiddie audience, such as a giant moth (Mothra) accompanied by twin fairies, or a mini-me son (Godzooky), who could only produce smoke rings, or Godzilla himself playing environmentalist while fighting a psychedelic smog monster. On those rare occasions, the franchise flirted with Rankin and Bass terrain, but, more often than not, Godzilla and his multifarious nemeses danced round each other like sumo wrestlers before delivering Curly Howard punches. This Godzilla is as far removed from the original as later Adventures of Superman (1952-1958) episodes were removed from first season episodes. The comparison is apt. The first incarnation of Godzilla, like the first appearance of George Reeves' Superman, possessed grit, even amongst cardboard sets, melodramatic dialogue, and basement effects. Certainly, the noirish black and white cinematography helped the Man of Steel. Later, the color Superman looks painfully long in the tooth, confronting a martian in green pajamas. We feel equally embarrassed for late Godzilla as a predecessor to Barney, fighting laughable villains in fatigued plots.

With the law of diminishing returns holding true, an attempt was made to take Godzilla back to his original, edgier incarnation in Toho's The Return of Godzilla (1984). This was a direct sequel to the 1954 original, ignoring all the remaining entries. As in the original, an American version followed, with Raymond Burr reprising his role in New World Pictures' Godzilla 1985 (1984). In the home front incarnation, most of the original's nuclear theme was jettisoned--which is nonsensical, since this has always been the series' driving point. As stale as Return is, 1985 is downright brittle. For once, Western audiences didn't buy it, resulting in a flop. However, Returns was a major success in Japan, which spawned a reboot cycle, with Godzillla quickly becoming a parody for the second time, battling robotic versions of himself.

In the late 1990s, Roland Emmerich directed his version--or rather the Jurassic Park (1993) version-of the character. Critics almost unanimously panned it, and zealous fans were even more contemptuous due to all the liberties Emmerich took with the franchise ""rules."" However, neither critics nor fanboys could stop Godzilla (1998) from a juggernaut three hundred million dollar worldwide gross. Despite box office success, the American market steered clear of Godzilla's radioactive breath until this summer's blockbuster extravaganza.

Director Gareth Edwards was hired to direct today's Godzilla on the strength of his first film, Monsters (2010), which was shot on a low budget (for Hollywood) and reaped both financial and critical success. Oddly, Edwards decided he wanted to hone in on Godzilla as a superhero (or, perhaps not so odd, since that genre has virtually doused all of our summers and those to come for God knows how long). It is something akin to how Lee Tamahori, in his Bond franchise entry, Die Another Day (2002), inexplicably decided to take the overblown You Only Live Twice (1967) as his inspiration point, rather than a superior, smaller effort like From Russia With Love (1963).

Despite Godzilla's nearly one hundred million dollar opening, it is premature to say whether Edwards' reboot of the character will stomp its way to or past Emmerich's financial success, although already critical and audience consensus is considerably more favorable with this summer's entry. Like much of the current crop, Godzilla is more an assault on the senses than actual movie. Edwards seems to have forgotten an unwritten lesson from the plethora of Godzilla sequels: apart from the original, the human occupants are an intrusion, especially when Godzilla is the protagonist. Instead, Edwards gives us an hour-long buildup with dull, stock characters we don't give a damn about. The only freshness to be found in the performances is with Juliette Binoche, who is killed within ten minutes. That leaves us with the angst of  Bryan Cranston, who is killed off within the first quarter of the movie. Of course, both are seasoned (old) actors, which leaves the remaining screen time for beefcake Aaron Taylor-Johnson who, miraculously, manages to make Raymond Burr look like an animated personality.

Of course there are other lessons: if you have a bland protagonist, give him a kid with a personality to protect from monster carnage. However, Edwards forgot the ""personality"" part. The obligatory doe-eyed tyke is simply plopped down on Johnson's lap and, after a few close calls, kid exits stage left when reunited with parents.

Godzilla himself makes a belated entry and, even among the monsters, he is a supporting character. The main bug, I was informed, is a ripoff of the monster in Cloverfield (2008). Unfamiliar with that film, I looked it up: indeed, it is so. Since it is the veteran lizard, not a newbie insect, who fans came to see, it is unlikely that they remained excited after the opening weekend.

By and large, 50s rockers aged better than their paler offspring, as anyone who has seen Keith Richards, Rod Stewart, or Ted Nugent lately can verify. Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and Little Richard managed to have fun and be far more innovative without reaping notoriety from unhinged self-destruction. The bulk of Godzilla is as lethargic as a second generation rocker burnout hobbling onto a nostalgia stage. Godzilla himself, the equivalent of a 50s rocker, gets virtually handed the tourist guide to world hotspots, and has much potential stomping ground, trampling through Vegas and San Francisco. There should be plenty of merriment to be had in seeing dual sin cities leveled. While, indeed, they do get pulverized, the production team inexplicably forgot to inject humor into the proceedings. Edwards takes the fashionable route of going with an action film over the character's horror origins, but still manages to pick and choose from the worst examples of both. Instead of investing wit into the mayhem, Edwards repeatedly cuts away to dull military defense maneuvering, with a wasted David Strathairn waxing concerned. That Edwards made a better, more imaginative film on one-hundredth the budget of Godzilla is telling.

What Godzilla does get right are the scenes when we finally get to see him as the living, breathing can of Raid. It takes him awhile to get to that Rock-'em-Sock-'em Robot ass-whompin' stage. Godzilla looks hip again, albeit briefly, and does his thing well enough to make us forget some of the risible dialogue that could have been written better by a high school student. That takes some doing, with one too many ""OMG, I can't believe this is happening"" exclamations after sight of the ""unidentified creature.""

Godzilla is not entirely disappointing, and mostly avoids the numbingly generic route of Transformer movies, which may be the worst examples of 21st century cinematic excess to date. Still, this should have been better. It cannot be that difficult to write and produce a better movie about a radioactive hydrogen dinosaur.

Eastern Scientist says to Westerners, sometimes when we defer to nature, we are better off. I will not play spoiler here, but be ready for a surprise ending!

Terrific acting, esp. by Bryan Lee Cranston, as Ford Brody, ostracized scientist, who believes that the terrible accident which took his wife's life years before in Japan at a nuclear reactor, was not ""natural"". An excellent script, replete with science lessons (and relatability to 2014) gives him strong support.

Special effects - phenomenal. Soundtrack - pretty cool.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is supposed to be present day, so don't get too worked up and exclaim, ""why don't they just go for the brain, with a lazer? That's what they do on 'Swamp People' with a rifle!""

The very mindful ""science class"" of the first half becomes the ticket-sale bottom line in the second half: monsters both big and small, fight other monsters, and the military fights them all. Until the end. No spoiler, as I said!

Finally, and typically.....the thing runs 15-20 minutes too long.",1400976000,4,1080,4.939226519337017
5955778,5,B00EXPOCXY,"""Godzilla"" is great! This is how the story goes: The government tried to destroy him in 1954, dropping nuclear bombs into the Pacific Ocean under the pretense of weapons testing. Instead, mankind, in its ignorance, awakened a new terror. Now, Godzilla rises again to restore balance as humanity stands defenseless.

The cast led by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (as Ford Brody), Ken Watanabe (as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa), Juliette Binoche (as Sandra Brody), Sally Hawkins (as Vivienne Graham), David Strathairn (as Admiral William Stenz) & Bryan Cranston (as Joe Brody), also as Godzilla & as a motion-capture consultant, Andy Serkis, is great. The directing by Gareth Edwards is great. The story by David Callaham & the screenplay by Max Borenstein is great.

The music by Alexandre Desplat is great. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is great. The film editing by Bob Ducsay (who also produced) is great. The casting by Sarah Halley Finn, Katie Doyle, Heike Brandstatter & Coreen Mayrs is great. The production design by Owen Paterson is great. The art direction by Ross Dempster, Kirsten Franson, Dan Hermansen, Scott Meehan & Grant Van Der Slagt is great. The set decoration by Elizabeth Wilcox, set designs by Kris Bergthorson, Nancy Anna Brown, Bryan Sutton & Stella Vaccaro, set dressings by Jared Goldfeder, Stephen Gibson, Kevin Kasper, Patrick Kearns, Craig Hoffmann, Nancy Ann Lai, Sam Sternthall & Ross Wahl is great. The costume design by Sharen Davis is great. The stunts coordinated by Jake Mervine, Layton Morrison & John Stoneham Jr. is great. The special make-up effects by Maiko 'Mo' Gomyo, Toby Lindala & Vince Yoshida is great. The special effects coordinated by Eric Frazier, Graphic Layout, James Paradis & Joel Whist is great. The visual effects coordinated by Charise E. Angone, Ashley Bellm, James Grummitt, Edan Hopper, Michelle Kee, Jamie Lewis, Victor F. Medel, Rosanna Mennear, Sara Moore, James Purdy, Samantha Rocca & Adrian Steel, supervised by Peter Chiang, Don Lee, Ken McGaugh, Andrew Morley, Darren Poe, Guillaume Rocheron, Katherine Rodtsbrooks, Patric Roos & Jim Rygiel is great.

This is a great and well-done, well-made remake of ""Godzilla"", that is definitely better than the 1998 remake. This is also a great film, visually, as well. This is also a film that is carefully well-paced. Gareth Edwards has made a great follow-up film to his film debut, ""Monsters"" (2010).

5955781,4,B00EXPOCXY,"A Godzilla 2014 review I'm more comfortable with than my last. What this movie tries to be it does fine at. It is one of my favorite Godzilla movies now however I won't lie... the movie was not quite what I had hoped for. After viewing the trailers, I was expecting the quintessential Godzilla movie with awesome monsters, monster fights, destruction, and great human characters all in visual big budget glory that would be universally loved. I was out of the country on opening weekend I did not see it went it first hit theaters, so I caught on to the positive and negative reactions towards the film before I got to see it the following week. After viewing the reviews I decided to go into it expecting anything as it didn't sound like the movie I originally expected. If I went in to this movie with the expectations I originally had I would've been furiously disappointed, glad I didn't. I saw it once in 2D and then in 3D, enjoying the second view more. I now feel comfortable enough to deliver a confident review for all to view.

THE VERDICT at the bottom pretty much summarizes my entire thoughts on the film and it's future so if you want just skip down to it feel free.

The Plot is basically 9/11 with giant monsters that you see mostly from the humans' point of view. It was a new take on the series and it was surprisingly believable, I liked what they did with it though it wasn't executed in the best way. The universe established by the film was a great way to reintroduce Godzilla to the world. There are plot holes and there are questions left unanswered but that did not bother me. This movie introduced to us this new universe and now the future films can work at exploring it more. Overall pretty good, I give the plot a 7/10. Being bogged down by the human characters knocks off points.

The Human characters as a whole were fine, nothing more nothing less. I love the cast but they aren't given much to do and that's a quite underwhelming given the talent behind them. This aspect was intended to carry the bulk of the movie but unfortunately it was not quite fit for that task. Bryan Cranston was exceptionally awesome though and I'm sad he was limited to a supporting role. Overall, I give this aspect a 6/10. Lacking.

Godzilla was Godzilla and that was awesome! He looked, sounded, and acted real, massive, and bad*** to the max wooh!!!! Every Godzilla scene was wonderfully memorable for their own unique reasons. However, this aspect loses a point because the amount of Godzilla scenes were limited a bit. Overall fantastic though, I give this aspect a 9/10.

The Mutos were awesome. I loved their looks, roars, and the overall nature behind them. Great monsters to add to the Godzilla saga. Overall no complaints, I give this aspect a 10/10.

The Visuals and Sound were perfect. Technically, this is the best Godzilla movie ever. 2D was good but viewing this movie in 3D had me in AWE and I never had a thing for 3D viewing. It was my dream to see a Godzilla movie with the visual and sound advancements made possible by big Hollywood budgets and this one nailed it! The soundtrack was great, not masterful but not worth dwelling on. Overall perfect, I give this aspect a 10/10.

THE VERDICT:

9/11 with giant monsters that focuses on the human drama above all, that's Godzilla 2014 for ya. It does fine at that but it could've been better had their been more depth to the overall human cast since that aspect was the main driving force. Thankfully the support provided by Godzilla, the MUTOs, and the technical awesomeness of this movie help pick up a significant amount of the lacking the human characters has. Despite its' flaws I believe Gareth Edwards and co. were the right choice for this project. I loved the care and heart put in to a lot of the scenes throughout the movie. This movie had to get Godzilla right and put him on the world map, it did just that. Now, I do feel for some of those that hold a negative opinion towards this movie though. Some people wanted Godzilla, the monsters, and the destruction center stage in mega million dollar technical glory, this movie was not that. Then there are some people disappointed because what the movie is it doesn't do well enough at that to anchor it above the rest of the crowd. I understand so now that brings us to the sequel. Godzilla 2 can not be set up like this one. The sequel must put Godzilla, the other monsters, and destruction center stage. Take care too as more does not equal better. Bring in at least one other Toho monster please (Mothra or King Ghidorah) along with original creations, I think that's realistic. Show more and stay creative with the monster fights and destruction scenes... Perhaps a bigger budget would be necessary for more of this so go for it ($200-220 million). Finally, make the human characters more interesting. I'd like to see Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins back above all and I hope they do return.

Simply put for the sequel... just cut the chains loose for Godzilla 2 and lets all have fun watching Godzilla, the monsters, and destruction live center stage in big budget technical glory!!! Oh YEAH!!!

But I do THANK all involved with the Godzilla 2014 project. Edwards, Watanabe, ATJ, Olsen, Binoche, Hawkins, Cranston, and everyone at Legendary and Warner Bros. for this. GODZILLA IS BACK!!!

5955783,1,B00EXPOCXY,"May be some spoilers below.

My mom and I went to see this today.  Oddly enough, I think this movie would be better watched at home.

The movie is about a creature or creatures that come looking for energy.  They get their energy from nuclear stuff.  Thus military weapons are being taken.  They have to stop them before it is to late.

I was expecting lots of great action, story and visuals.  To me, I got none of that.  I never once cared about any of the characters in this movie.  If they lived, if they died, it didn't matter at all to me.  You never have time to make a connection with any of the characters.  It is a shame.  In a movie in which the characters are fighting to survive, if you do not care about them, the movie is kind of pointless.  It was like each actor had a scene or scenes and they were reading right from a script.  It just felt so dull.

The creatures.  Ok, while they looked interesting, that looked a bit too interesting.  They just looked like things that were made to look good on a computer.  They did not at all seem like creatures that have lived for decades and were real at all.  You do get to see them move, fly and fight.  But it just all seemed so boring.  Like watching a video on the Internet made by some college kids.  I never felt anything at all.  When they would really show the monsters that was really all you would see.  It just felt so unbelievable.  I do understand that we are talking about Godzilla here.  But it did not feel threatening or make me sit on the edge of my seat.  I actually almost fell asleep.

Another thing about the monsters is this.  They never really explain anything or give you time to come to grips with what in the heck is going on.  You just seem big monsters attacking cities.  Just like the characters played by people, you just feel like, so what?

Honestly, I've no clue what the story was for this movie.  I get the just of it.  But as far as characters personally, I've not a clue.  Nothing flows in this movie.  When I was leaving, I just felt like I was watching a movie with computer monsters.  Boring, lame story, non-emotional or believable characters and drug on.  I will rent this when it comes out.  But I think it was a complete waste of time and money.",1400803200,13,2250,4.214622641509434

5955785,5,B00EXPOCXY,"This movie was action from beginning to end.  And unlike the previous Godzilla movie filmed in New York City, this movie was much more believable.  It was a total surprise, and a welcomed one, to find that finally Godzilla was a hero instead of the villain.  Heck, even the earlier Japanese versions of Godzilla movies finally made him out to be a hero.  Some reviews say the characters are weak and uninteresting.  I didn't pay all that money to watch boring personal problems unfold on the screen, as was with the previous version where they seemed more concerned about furthering their careers due to Godzilla's arrival rather than running from the chaos.  The previous New York version was so unreal, as Godzilla looked more like an over-grown T-Rex and didn't spit out fire, and ran thru the streets faster than anything that large could ever move.  Plus how did he get from Japan to New York....by way of the Panama Canal???  This 2014 Godzilla movie where he ends up on the west coast is more realistic.  I can't wait to get my DVD to watch it over again.",1400716800,7,1062,4.6063829787234045
5955786,4,B00EXPOCXY,"You can't keep Godzilla down. Even the suckitude of Roland Emmerich cannot banish the city-stomping radioactive lizard.

And so he gets a 21st-century Hollywood reboot in ""Godzilla,"" which manages to do what Emmerich could not -- make an entertaining, serious action movie that stars Godzilla as the king of the monsters. It needs some fat trimmed off and less focus on the human characters, but it's a fun movie that builds slowly up to a truly mind-blowing final battle.

Fifteen years ago, a nuclear plant in Japan suffered a catastrophic meltdown, rendering the entire region radioactive. On that day, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) lost both his home and his mother.

Cut to present day. Brody returns to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son, only to be called to Japan by the news that his dad Joe (Bryan Cranston) has been arrested for trying to get to his old, supposedly-radioactive house. Ever since his wife's death, Joe has obsessively believed that SOMETHING is being housed in the old plant, which was responsible for its failure. He's right, of course, because conspiracy nuts in movies always are.

So what's going on? The area is completely free of radiation, and the old plant is now home to a monstrous pulsing chrysalis... which promptly hatches into a MUTO, a skyscraper-sized insectoid with glowing eyes and wolf jaws.

Worse, it immediately starts flying toward the US. Even worse than that, it seems to be attracted to the call of another MUTO, meaning that they might mate and lay eggs. Say goodbye to civilization. The military tries -- and repeatedly fails -- to stop the MUTOs from smashing American cities to bits, even as a prehistoric sea-lizard known as ""Gojira"" seems to be following the giant bugs.

""Godzilla"" is a better movie than it has any right to be, but isn't quite as good as it COULD be. Director Gareth Edwards films the whole movie in a slower, grander fashion than most action movies -- the first two acts are mostly a slow build, each act climaxing with a massive swathe of destruction hammering through assorted cities. Everything is just building towards Godzilla finally confronting the MUTOs.

This is both the movie's blessing, and its curse. On one hand, it gives the whole movie a respectful, slow-building atmosphere, with lots of attention given to how the plot unfolds. Despite the comic book science (the monsters feed on radiation?), Max Borenstein's screenplay has the feel of being very careful and well-thought-out. And it holds an echo of the original ""Gojira's"" symbolism about the nuclear bomb -- except this time, it's about the dangers of trying to contain nuclear energy that might backfire on you and level your city.

On the other... it takes quite some time for Godzilla to do much more than swim around the Pacific in a very urgent manner. The movie could use perhaps fifteen minutes of trimming, perhaps from the intrusive subplots about Elle and the kid. Seriously, nobody cares about those characters. Just get us back to the wanton destruction and giant monsters.

Speaking of which, it has an unfortunate tendency to flip away from the action. For instance, our first shot of Godzilla in all his city-stomping glory in Honolulu... is followed by a scene in Ford's living room, with a quick glimpse of what happened. On the news. On the TV. It zooms straight over the fine line between ""heated anticipation"" and ""violent frustration,"" because all we want are monsters beating each other.

But when we DO see some monster action, it is GLORIOUS. The MUTOs tear vast smoking gashes in whatever cities they totter through, but the real draw is the massive battle between them and Godzilla in the third act. It's brutal, violent and has a primal magnificence, as they bite, tear and blast each other with radioactive breath. It almost makes all the teasing and delays worth it.

Despite the completely generic main character, the characters are actually handled rather gracefully -- no contrived villainy, no hyperaggression, no soapboxes, no straw men, and no comic relief. Taylor-Johnson gives a passable performance, but he's overshadowed by the brief performance of Bryan Cranston, who radiates the brittle wild energy of a desperate man. Ken Watanabe has little to do except exposit, but he does that with wholehearted intensity.

""Godzilla"" has some hefty flaws, but it doesn't keep this movie from being entertaining -- serious and earnest, yet wildly energetic whenever those radioactive beasts come onscreen. Hail the King of the Monsters!",1400716800,13,4527,4.99734395750332

Gareth Davies obviously borrowed from the Cloverfield premise, with excessive focus on human drama, and the kaiju being almost incidental. In Cloverfield, this concept was original and worked pretty well. Here, the result is a disaster. All the action scenes were disappointing. The drama was tedious. As Kickass, ATJ was awesome.

5955792,4,B00EXPOCXY,"This movie just set the bar for fantastic Summer blockbusters. While in the middle of the movie, sitting in my comfy seat at the Hamilton Town IMAX theatre with our family, I sensed that we were experiencing a little of the internal gut punch it must have been for people watching Wizard of Oz or King Kong for the very first time.

Gareth Edwards tightly restrained cinematic approach hits a sweet spot that, at least for me, brought forth that adrenaline-propelled confession that Im watching something fresh, and brand new for the movie screen. What is that something? It's not really the CGI or special effects. It is the way Edwards puts it altogether on screen. When Mr. Zilla shows up on screen and delivers his initial 2014 version of that famous roar. One can't help but sense his scale, his menace, and his strength. Despite the eruption of goosebumps on 90% of the arms and necks of the moviegoers in that theater, that was only the first act. And Edward's elegantly builds his story around that historic roar...so it only gets better from there.

Ive read some reviews that claim the story is weak or that the characters are one dimensional. I can see why they might write that...but I don't agree with them (or sense that those intangibles even matter here).

I think the story and subplots, while not complex, set the table perfectly for this kind of movie. The acting is terrific, and while the dialogue isn't Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller or Philippa Boyens & Fran Walsh, it is spot on.

Sure. The director couldve used Cranston, Watanabe, Binoche, and Straitharn to give the movie more intellectual grit, but he smartly avoided letting movie stars tell this great story, and let the story, to immersive effect, tell itself.

Sure. The director couldve milked more emotional gravity from the young family of Navy Lieutenant Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) Brody, his wife Elle (Lizzie Olsen) and their 2 year old Sam, but that touch point with the audience is easy enough to make. The real connection point the director needs to focus on is the character with his name on the marquis. And Gareth Edwards does that masterfully.

The movies special effects are not overwrought or ostentatious. In fact, theres a kind of noir murkiness in Seamus McGarveys cinematographyseemingly inspired by films like The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rear Window, Jaws, and others where the suspense is not artificeits infrastructure.

The restraint Edwards has in keeping his stars (the monsters) hidden is not driven from that old saw of hide the monster. It has a riveting purpose and his restraint works at just the right pace to keep the focus where it should be - on Godzilla.

I don't know about other theaters, but the people at the Hamilton Town IMAX, including me & the whole family, could not just sit and watch. They stamped their feet, and applauded, screamed, and whistled when the moments on film asked for it. Its not just another Godzilla movie. It is THE Godzilla movie.

Its not the movie I thought we'd get from a 'rookie' director and Warner Brothers. Not to say my expectations were low. I really, really wanted this movie to be great. And, in my opinion, it really, really was.

LOTS of talking. Scientific gobbledygook.  Lots of pointless running around. Lots of jumping to conclusions. How quickly we assume this massive beast is on our side as he swims in formation wifh our ships.

The MUTOs were unoriginal and boring. The characters were poorly written. Poor Bryan Cranston. Emoting so hard I thought his wig might fall off. Or was his hair CGI?? There were many times that it wouldn't have surprised me if an actor had turned, looked into the camera and apologized for the words he was saying.

Distances and time lost all meaning. Once the timer on the bomb started those soldiers were able to drag it ouf of that enormous pit and halfway across San Francisco and still have time to dink around on the boat. And for a bomb designed to make that used on Hiroshima ""look like a firecracker"", apparently getting it about half a mile beyond Golden Gate Bridge before it exploded was enough.  No worries about the shock wave or radioactive water raining down on San Francisco.

What was the point of the HALO jump? Other than looking cool?  Seems like that wasted a lot of valuable time. Time the monsters used to eat the city. Time for the bomb to get closer to detonation! Time for me to sneak out and use the bathroom!

And the big G pulling that stupid ET ""he's dead...sniff...no! He's alive!"" routine was ridiculous. He saved your city?? Did you watch the buildings tumble like....tumbling buildings??

BTW. What the heck does a beast his size eat? Obviously not humans. How much sushi must he devour to maintain that chubby figure? Or maybe he's a vegan!

OK. I get the whole suspension of belief thing. But a book or movie should maintain its inner logic. Or will we see Godzilla join the Avengers or Justice League? Or maybe he's an X-man!

5955794,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I am disappointed.

The awesome, frightening posters and sneak-peak previews all hinted at a Godzilla that would be akin to the original Godzilla of the very first film: a colossal, living and breathing and destroying all in its path Hell on Earth.  A monster, roused from the ocean depths by man's own technological tamperings with Mother Nature, Godzilla was pure and primitive payback in that first austere, chilling, dead-serious classic film.  So the posters and previews for this version directly pointed to that type of Godzilla.  But what we get instead is much more so the Godzilla from all of the loony sequels to that first epic - the user-friendly Godzilla who has a change of heart and sometimes helps the Japanese people and the world by taking on such titanic terrors as MechaGodzilla, Gigan, Destroyah, King Ghidorah, the Smog Monster and so on and so forth.  Thus, along those lines, in this GODZILLA we have Godzilla the nascent Superhero battling two ridiculous-looking hybrids of Mothra and Rodan, the MUTOs.  And since the movie has far more of the MUTOs in it than the titular character, the film - in all honesty - should have been called MUTO - or at least tell it like it is and call it GODZILLA VS MUTO!

Forget all the destruction caused by the three monsters in this movie, the real destruction was levelled upon this film by the movie's makers themselves! This movie is a mess in so many ways I don't know where to begin.  Here are some Spoiler Alert scattershot comments then: big mistake to not make the star...the star!  Bad structure to give the audience the MUTO way before Godzilla makes his bow.  We become immunized to the gigantic long before the giant we came to see even appears.  G's roar is also lame compared to the horrifying sound of the original.  Maybe they toned down the terror in the timbre just to make G more user-friendly.  Another faux pas: mostly every time something is about to happen involving Godzilla, the scene cuts to the dull, cliched, terribly acted (with the sole exception of Bryan Cranston) human tale.  There is one scene, for example, in San Francisco Bay with Godzilla surfacing - and it looks darn terrific - but...for some inept reason...it cuts away!  And this strip-tease approach happens way too many times and gets tiresome fast. The CGI would also have been much more impressive if it were used in a much more imaginative way.  There are no really good scenes at all of the King of the Monsters in the ocean, or coming ashore or seen from a distance or an aerial perspective or standing amidst the fiery rubble of a city he supposedly destroyed - as in the one riveting poster.  And the only thing Godzilla destroys are things destroyed while battling the MUTOs!  Collateral damage is all.  One also never gets a sense that the presence of the super-sized monsters is in any way a world-wide threat - or that entire populations are being effected and even destroyed. And where is POTUS in all of this?  (Perhaps his absence was a veiled comment on current reality?) Again, the Godzilla hinted at in the posters and sneak-peaks...is not the Godzilla in this film.  Herein he somewhat reminded me more of a reptilian version of Peter Jackson's bloated Kong - especially in the scenes where he may be dying after having battled the incredibly annoying MUTOs.  However, after the last scene wherein Godzilla rebounds and heads for the water, I half expect to see him in the sequel wearing a big red cape with a G on it.

One thing more: Alexandre Desplat is a fine composer.  But not as evidenced by his score for this film.  The music sounds like it came out of a can, like practically every other action film score of the last 10 years or more.  Compare this music to the masterworks writ by Akira Ifukube for the original Gojira films. The best musical sequence in this new film uses the monolith music from Kubrick's 2001 (as it did in the awesome, epic preview) as the soldiers parachute out to battle...well, in the preview we were led to believe it was Hell-on-Earth Godzilla.  Truth is, the men are parachuting down to the ruined city to fight the annoying MUFOs.  But the point is that the music in that scene - written by someone else - is the best-wed sequence of music and visuals.  The rest of the score is cliched and seemingly out of a can.

One more thing, as Columbo would say:  the reason the original Godzilla's legs were somewhat hefty was because there was a man in a suit.  But since this Godzilla is created by CGI, why are his legs even fatter than those of the original? And why - since the '98 fiasco was burdened with the babies, does this film tiptoe into the exact same waters via the Mother MUFO?

Bottom line: disappointing - and not what was promised by its early promotion.",1400544000,25,4779,4.617751479289941

5955797,3,B00EXPOCXY,"The trailers that I witnessed in the theater (especially the one for the upcoming Disney dark fantasy ""Maleficent"") looked amazing in their 3-D form, and for the most part, the beginning of ""Godzilla"" was the same experience. And yet, as the movie went on, it became increasingly obvious that something was not quite right in the presentation. By the time of the final battle between you know who and the other you know who, I did not feel that I was in the middle of a monster fight at all but rather that the effect of the 3-D quality had lost its steam (in effect). There is a terrific sequence where two or three soldiers are seen walking out over a wrecked railroad/bridge and nearly fall off into a long drop below, and the 3-D during this part was terrific. I don't get it. At some points, the bugs and the people were right in my face. At other times, especially (and most disappointingly) during the climax, it felt as if the film retreated into a 2-D scheme. However, kudos to whomever crafted the Gojira (?) monsters, because those beasts were sensational looking, the stuff of nightmares if anything ever has been.
I can't believe these reviewers on here explaining to you why the film is good or bad in their opinion--you know if you like monster movies or not, and there is nothing special (or special in human terms) about a silly movie such as this. I enjoyed it on the level of a pure summer drive-in monster/invasion film, but there is seriously nothing further to be read into this madness. I think the hype about films like this is too overblown, and I actually like the Godzilla character, but I didn't once wet myself in anticipation of seeing it on the BIG SCREEN. So, again, the 3-D effects were most interesting, but I'm hoping that the Disney/Jolie movie will get it right and give me a 3-dimensional experience of a fantasy nether world for the entire movie's duration. ""Godzilla"" was, in some sense, a noble attempt, but not quite the jaw-dropping experience (in effects terms) that I thought it would be. C+",1400457600,4,2036,4.596153846153846

5955799,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I've been a fan of Godzilla since my childhood and though I may not be a fanatic, I do appreciate the Big G on a pure guilty pleasure level. I have been re-watching all the Godzilla films in order ( I own all 30, but I'm not a fanatic ,,,really ha-ha) and have just finished the Showa era films, so this movie comes at a good time.

I wanted to see this new entry after watching some of the older (classic) Godzilla films to have something to compare it to. I'll get the bad out of the way right now. This film is too long and the human drama isn't very interesting and while I enjoy the simmering pot approach, we are teased a little too long before any real payoff. The 3D is very good, but this film doesn't really utilize the effect much.

Now the good news! This is a much better film than the 1998 reboot capturing at the very least the essence of the creature that so many hold such fond memories for.  The CGI is excellent and the Big G looks pretty awesome. Godzilla battles other giant monsters (YAY!!!) and the giant monster battles have a good mix of camera techniques so they always look interesting and realistic. G Man has and uses his radioactive breath too!

It seems that the biggest disappointment with this film is the lack of screen time for Godzilla. which I find odd as in most of the older Godzilla films, he doesn't appear until the last third of the film either, but I agree I would have liked to have had an earlier battle that wasn't in 5 second glimpses. I'm all for building tension, but give the audience what they want GIANT MONSTER MEYHEM!

I wanted to love this film, but ended up liking it. It's a good movie and shows promise for the rebirth of the Godzilla franchise. A franchise that can go where it never could before. I'm hearing there will be a sequel or two and I for one can't wait to see what they will do with the next film. Hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes and not over complicate things with subplots and inane technical jargon.

5955800,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I will first start off by saying that the movie was AWESOME in my opinion, but the movie did miss a few things. There were awesome graphics, lots of chaos, a (surprisingly) better story than the first American Godzilla in '97, and plenty of surprises that will leave you both speechless and in question. In the end, you will ask yourself ""well, what about this"" and ""I noticed you forgot that"" and so on about 10 times or whatever, so if you are a person who likes pointing out flaws and holes in movies, you will come not to enjoy the film, but just because the story is not the best doesn't mean it is not a great movie.

Acting- Pretty damn fine acting in my opinion. The characters were dynamic, the conflicts seemed real, and yet not over acted, and some funny things that the audience knows, but they don't.

Setting- (SPOILER-it starts in japan, but ends in America). Unlike the original American Godzilla, which only stuck in NYC, this Godzilla has Hawaii, Las Vegas, and plenty of mayhem in California.

Graphics- defiantly does not skip on up-to-date designing. The graphics are as good as it seems to get, so they are pretty superb.

There is plenty more to say, but I'm afraid I would only spoil the movie for you. There is lots to keep you both entertained and a bit confused, but in the end, if you just like seeing what happens, you won't care. I just wanted to see buildings and things get destroyed, but let's just say that I got more than I bargained for, but in a good way. There was action, adventure, humor, twists, surprises, and mild violence. Oh who am I kidding, THE VIOLENCE ROCKED! Go see it in theaters now, I saw it Thursday, May 15, at 7 p.m.  (IF YOU WANT SPOILERS, HEAD TO THE BOTTOM OF MY PAGE)-though I highly recommend not.

SPOILERS- Godzilla is not the main enemy in the movie, it is these 2 giant mantis-like creatures that eat radiation and use EMP-tech embedded into their bio-systems, w/heads that look like the aliens in Halo 4, but not the Covenant. Godzilla fights the 2 of them to the death, using his electricity power, which is brought back and not revealed till the last half hour of the movie (awesome) and he goes out into the ocean, where it is the first monster movie that the government doesn't try to finish him off, leaving you to ask yourself where he came from and what will happen to him now, even though it may be a hangover for an upcoming sequel.

5955801,4,B00EXPOCXY,"If you haven't seen Godzilla yet Ill TRY to make this spoiler fee. Keyword is TRY, so you've been warned!

The movie starts off following, man I hate when reviews go into movie summary, so let me stop here. If you want a synopsis of the movie then go read imdb! Let me jump STRAIGHT to the review which is why you are all here. From the minute the movie starts you get the nostalgic feeling that this is going to be a dark film. The tone of it was exceptional from start to finish. You never really know what to expect. The musical score didn't help with that. It just added to the suspense. You don't really know what is going on until one of the monsters is discovered and then the question you ask yourself is how it even got here. While the movie does a good job explaining with some story you still don't really get a clear cut answer except they (the m.u.t.o.s  Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) pre-date the dinosaurs and they live off radiation. They have been hiding for years near the Earths core and now they are back! So thats the mystery to be thinking about throughout the movie and it is played out very well. Now this is all a setup because when the Big Guy does finally show you are left with some satisfaction.

Characters

The characters were nicely casted. Bryan Cranston did an EXCELLENT job portraying a father/widow that has lost EVERYTHING yet trying to solve the mystery even though everybody including his son thinks he is crazy. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays his son and now new father and husband but of course has signed up with the military. So he was torn between his national duty to his country and his duty to his family. I believe there was an excellent balance between the two. He was not only trying to protect his family but his country at the same time. Speaking of his wife, Elizabeth Olsens character unfortunately is kind of forgettable which is sad to say. Just not enough screen time with her. But I will say when she was on screen she did a fantastic job. And finally we have Ken Watanabe. Man did he really play the part. I cracked up when he first uttered the name Godzilla because it was just classic. His narrative throughout the movie just added to the tone and just made it that more deep.

Action

The action and CGI were top notch. From Godzilla swimming through the bay to him towering over the city, it just could not have been better. There was one pose he struck where you get the feeling Here I Am Bitches. Come Get Some. At least thats what I thought was running through his brain haha. Which leads me to my only drawback of the movie. The fight scenes. When Godzilla is first introduced to the male muto, they start the bout then the scene transitions to people in the city. Then when we are re-introduced to the fight it switches to a news cast OF the fight which was funny but uncalled for. We want to see the fight! I get the style the director Gareth Edwards was trying to show but we got teased a little too much. The last battle sequence was phenomenal though and will go down as one of the best monster show downs ever. Will not spoil but a certain Godzilla attack uses has NOT been forgotten. I was cheering along with the audience during the fight. There was just so much excitement and thrill.

Sound

The sound and musical score were probably the best attributes of the film. The musical score kept you on the edge of your seat. I kept thinking throughout the hes coming scenes damn this reminds me of Jaws. It was just a nice orchestrated build up and I thought it was executed perfectly. Now on to the sound of Godzilla. Holy S&*! Yea I don't like cursing through reviews. I think its just tacky. His roar sent chills down my spine and the rest of the audience.

Indecisive Audience?

As for the negative feedback of this film, I just want to say this. If this movie went over the top with monster on monster CGI filled fight scenes then there would have been a lot more complaints about it. Not enough human element. Too much destruction bla bla bla. This movie was perfectly balanced in my opinion and I honestly think they pros outweigh the cons. Either way audiences would have found doubt so Im glad the director chose this route.

Final Rating

Overall I give this movie a 8.5/10  Sure it could have been better. It had its flaws. But I honestly still believe this to be the best monster flick in years. The director stayed true to how classic monster movies were made back in the day and Im glad he kept that concept.",1400457600,4,4504,4.399038461538462
5955802,5,B00EXPOCXY,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

As I have written in my Amazon.com review of ""Pacific Rim"", I had always keenly wished for a mega-million, state-of-the-art, blockbuster treatment of the legendary lizard. And boy, is this 2014 spectacular rendition of ""Godzilla"" ever IT!  To put it succinctly, I think Gareth Edwards and company succeeded in rescuing Godzilla from the emasculating abyss of chintzy camp and restoring him to his mighty symbolic status as not only a nuclear, near-supernatural, vengeful force of nature, but also, ironically enough, of natural, balanced harmony.

In other words ""Godzilla 2014"" first pays respectful, meticulous homage to the 1954 (cult) classic and then expands the lizard's mythic status.  As in the original, to the likely dismay of attention-deficit sufferers, Godzilla wisely doesn't pop onto the screen full-blown right away.  At the beginning of the film, we merely get a sepia-toned photographic glimpse of his scaly back towering above the waves as the product of World War II nuclear deployment.  We soon move forward to an apparent nuclear accident at the Janjira nuclear plant where nuclear physicist and engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) works.  Like in at least some Toho Godzilla productions, Joe assumes the role of the ""Cassandra scientist"", which is a scientist who really knows what's going on, but can't convince other, skeptical scientists, government officials, or anyone else of the truth until it's too late.

Yes, the plant does emit nuclear radiation, enough to claim the lives of several radiation specialists, including Joe's nobly self-sacrificing wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) who fiercely urges the tearful Joe to seal the breach so that the contamination doesn't spread.  At first, plant officials seem merely to want to cover-up a run-of-the mill nuclear disaster.  But Joe eventually convinces his initially disbelieving son Navy Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) that something even more threatening is looming.  The power-plant radius has no lethal radiation whatsoever.  Also, during the accident, Joe picks up electromagnetic pulses of biological origin, almost as if two creatures are communicating.  As the movie ominously and deliberately progresses, the monstrously REAL truth literally comes out.  Within the quarantined plant, some weird cocoon has absorbed the ambient nuclear energy.  It eventually hatches and a tremendous ""Alien""-like/praying mantis-like insectoid thing goes on its destructive march - and flight (it has wings).  With the knowledgeable help of Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), who seems to  know a lot about these monster matters, the U.S. military eventually determines that the big bug male is flying toward a rendezvous with its wingless mate, which was incubating thousands of larva at a nuclear waste containment facility in Nevada.  She breaks out impressively as well.

Okay, it's time for Godzilla to show up, and when he does, people, honest to goodness, I was just overwhelmed! Magnificent! He intercepts the winged male in Honolulu for a relatively brief but devastating tussle. The winged male escapes somehow and continues toward his rendezvous.  The military determines that the three ""things"" will converge in San Francisco where at least a contained nuclear detonation in San Francisco harbor should take care of all three, right.  But as Dr. Serizawa reminds them, these creatures thrive on nuclear energy (even though the blast itself MAY kill them).  Furthermore, he says that it is just possible that the lizard monster is mankind's only hope for salvation and that it may be better to just ""let them fight.""

Oh boy, do they ever fight!  The humans somewhat predictably recede a little into the background, although Ford resourcefully and heroically does his best to evacuate San Francisco, discover and destroy the insectoids' brood, help detonate the nuclear missile, and return to his family.  We may have had to wade through some exposition, mystery, and set-up to get to the battle royal, but I think it was certainly worth the wait.  There's no 1998 ""Zilla"" here.  Godzilla's got all the goods, and he'll need them, because the insectoids are both formidable, ferocious enemies.  What's the outcome?  I heartily suggest you see this for yourself.

""Godzilla 2014"" through its measured, solemn, deliberate pace re-establishes the ""Lizard King"".  It's an infinitely satisfying monster mash, to be sure, but it also manages to allude to mankind's destructive tendencies and its presumption to tame nature, rather than realize that it is at nature's whim, as Dr. Serizawa comments.  And it even suggests that while Godzilla seems to side with the humans, that could be a tenuous alliance.  Toho, Godzilla, ""Pacific Rim"", and monster movie fans should gobble up ""Godzilla 2014"".  Others, like my Amazon.com friend and prolific reviewer Andrew Ellington may understandably and reasonably dismiss it as crazy, stupid fun, as he did in his ""Pacific Rim"" review.  Nevertheless, for its genre, Godzilla is INTELLIGENT, rational, crazy, stupid fun!",1400457600,9,5089,5.406844106463878
5955803,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Good film.  Great CGI and entertaining.  Kept me in my seat.  The flick begins in the Phillipeans, and moves to Japan, where scientist Joe Brody and his wife work at a nuclear power plant.  Son Ford Brody is in school when the plant blows.  (This is all in the very beginning.)

Fast-forward about 20 years or so, and Ford is now a Navy Lieutenant, living in California.  He just gets home on leave, spending time catching up with his wife Elle and son, when he gets a phone call about his dad and has to leave for Japan.  Dad is still obsessed with the past explosion, trying to find out what went wrong.  Right after Ford arrives, Daddy Joe talks Ford into going into the still closed-off forbidden zone to search for clues and records.  Joe believes something is about to happen again.  About then, all heck starts to break loose as we begin to discover there is more to the ""blow"" years ago that caused so much death and destruction.  We begin to see what's really going on in the forbidden zone.

There is lots of action.  There is Godzilla, of course, but also two other creatures that look like robotic mosquitoes.  Kind of bizarre, but I can live with it.  It was still a great flick--action packed/ and antastic CGI.  Even had some old footage in the very beginning of the movie.  The only thing I would change is the appearance of the mosquitoe things--too robotic in appearance.

In my opinion, I would not recommend for children under 8 because of the death and destruction.  It might be a little much for their developing minds.

Update 523/14 - To give you another perspective -- My 40 year old son saw the movie yesterday and loved it.  He did not have a problem with the Mosquito looking things.  He just wished they would have engaged Godzilla earlier in the movie, but he said it was bad-xxx (a good thing for a movie) and especially loved the end scenes where the critters were fighting (that's a given -- we know the good guys and bad guys always fight).",1400457600,4,1974,4.4525139664804465
5955804,3,B00EXPOCXY,"The good news about this movie, I guess, is that all the parts about Godzilla doing stuff are quite good. Godzilla looks, sounds, and behaves totally correctly. The bad-guy creatures, the MUTOs, are pretty well executed too, with gangly limbs and big teeth, and evil red eyes so you know they're not nice. They're like the Cloverfield monster only not stupid.

The bad news is that the rest of the movie is just super weak. Or rather, the rest of the movies, because the filmmakers seem to have tried to shoehorn about three movies into one running.

First there's a movie about Bryan Cranston, who is a nuclear scientist who loses his wife when monsters eat the plant where they work, but he doesn't know that and becomes a reclusive conspiracy nut investigating the disaster against a government coverup. This part is played with over-the-top sincerity which is asinine when it clearly calls for massive scenery-chewing which Cranston is totally equipped to deliver.

That movie ends in about 45 minutes and we are treated to a movie where Ken Watanabe palls around with Aaron Taylor-Johnson for literally no reason at all. Johnson does not do as badly as many critics have said, but neither he nor Watanabe, who is kind of a big deal in Japan, have any interesting lines. Instead they mostly look at things and express shock, which is sort of the easy road in a monster movie.

During this second movie, we get our first monster fights. They are presented as from-the-ground affairs, a la Cloverfield (again, but good) and seeing all the havoc the monsters wreck on the ground is pretty cool. A cut from Godzilla attacking a MUTO to TV highlights of the fight including Godzilla staggering around with the creature on his head is quite amusing and calls to mind the wrestling feel of the 60s films.

Eventually all the monsters converge on San Francisco to fight. At this point we shift to a more traditional view of the Godzilla fights, which is jarring given that until this point this perspective has been totally unused. The people are still doing stuff, but they are now totally disposable. In particular, Elizabeth Olson, who plays Johnson's wife, spends the whole segment accidentally winding up wherever Godzilla is breaking things. This is presumably to remind us that monsters are dangerous, and is predicated on the assumption that we only care about named characters.

I want to reiterate that everything Godzilla-related is rad as hell. Godzilla breaks stuff, he breathes blue fire on things, and he rassles other big monsters. I found myself pumping my arms in joy at least three times. It's all the non-Godzilla material that is rubbish, and I place the blame pretty much entirely on Gareth Edwards. This is a director whose last monster movie, the unimaginatively named ""Monsters"" managed to make the relationship between two actors WHO ARE ACTUALLY MARRIED totally unconvincing. Clearly, between people and monsters, Edwards is good at one thing, and it's not the people.

Perhaps the unerring weakness of the human element wouldn't be so noticeable if it wasn't so deathly serious. After all, I love the Heisi Godzillas (the films made from the 80s to the 90s) but the recurring human lead in those won her role in a beauty contest, after all. I am under no illusions that anyone in them delivers Oscar-caliber performances, ever. But Megumi Odaka and her co-stars KNEW THEY WERE IN A MOVIE ABOUT BIG MONSTERS BREAKING STUFF. They had fun with it. This movie seems to be a race to see who can bore us to tears first before Godzilla shows up and we stop caring altogether. For me the winner was Olson, who is essentially like a less talented, more boring Rashida Jones.

Do I regret going? Hell no. Sitting through an hour of boring people doing boring things before the monster wrestling starts is par for the course in Godzilla movies. It's just disappointing to see that trend carried onward, instead of a film that is ENTIRELY good.",1400457600,10,3956,4.82448377581121
5955805,4,B00EXPOCXY,"""Godzilla"" 2014 is without question the best looking Godzilla movie ever. It smashes the 1998 Roland Emmerich ""Godzilla"" like a Toyota under the foot of the skyscraper monster. Comparing it to its Japanese predecessors that made the character iconic is sort of pointless. ""Mothra Vs. Godzilla"" is classic monster movie heaven. Godzilla's battles with Ghidorah and Destoroyah are irreplaceable in their purely enjoyable cheesiness. They are quite simply loved for that very cheesiness. ""Godzilla"" 2014 tossed the cheesiness away and went for the reality gusto. So, you either want cheese with your giant nuclear waste created lizard, or you do not.

There is absolutely nothing cheesy about ""Godzilla"" 2014 unless you consider the attempts to make personal connections amid all the destruction, cheesy. Somehow those attempts sort of fell flat  despite the fact that some very capable actors were trying to make those connections. Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) plays Joe Brody who is a nuclear physicist who has been tracking the slowly building anomaly, unsure of what he is tracking. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays his son, Lieutenant Ford Brody, who doesn't know what to think of his father until his fathers predictions start gaining merit. Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, plays Elle Brody; Ford's wife who is trying to stay alive, find Ford and save lives while dodging falling buildings.

Unfortunately, there is nothing complicated or extremely interesting about anything the humans do in this film, which makes the ""Cloverfield""-like cutaways from the true star of the film, Godzilla, a little disappointing. For that matter, Godzilla's storyline isn't all that complicated either, but many of the human elements of the film serve absolutely zero purpose other than to show off the money and effects they spent on making Godzilla look absolutely breath-taking. That, rightfully so, is the saving grace of the film. The scenes of epic destruction and people adapting to a crumbling environment are mind-blowing.

To think that you're going to see ""Godzilla"" in order to be affected with dramatic stories is unrealistic, but the thing is, the creators tried. ""Godzilla"" is an old-school monster film with new-school technology and effects. Despite its problems, Godzilla entertains. The films that ""Godzilla"" was founded upon weren't anything that challenged the brain either. Once you understand that and understand that the creators at least tried to make it something more, you should enjoy what it is; a good old fashion monster slug-fest.",1400457600,5,2579,5.376237623762377
5955806,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I saw this movie last night in the theatre. It was crowded and I understand it's doing over $100 million box off for opening weekend. Big numbers. Unfortunately the movie disappointed me a great deal. I don't wish to spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet, so I will try to be as generic as possible in my comments. The movie did not have much of a plot. What plot there was, was written to the 10 year old level with large non-sensical gaps. Great Sci Fi/Monster movies maintain intelligence. Think Alien, King Kong, The Thing from Another World etc. You believe that these stories could actually happen. There is just so much about this movie that makes absolutely no sense and has no logic. Yes, there were monsters, as expected, yes they had a couple of fights, most of which were pretty tame. Yes, there is a winner. And be sure of this, this is a flag pole movie that will have 2 or 3 sequels. But I felt the plot lacked direction. Strictly by the numbers. Godzilla and friends wreck CGI cities, bridges, ships etc. People scramble around in amazing calm, no one really panicking. The world is on the brink and no one is really breaking a sweat. In the end, the survivor of the final battle simply swims off heading for the next sequel. Nuclear bombs. Yep, got em'. Detonated, yep. The impact - gee, not really shown, what happened when they blew up.... ummmm, not quite sure, anybody know??? Wasn't in the movie. This disappointed me in the same way that Ang Lee's Hulk did a few years ago. The 1999 Godzilla with Mathew Broderick was much better all around and I'd vote for Cloverfield before I'd ever think about watching this new Godzilla movie again. But then just as the subsequent Edward Norton Hulk movie was far superior to the And Lee, maybe the 2nd installment of this emerging Godzilla trilogy will be much better as well. Let's hope so.

1. They kill their best actor in the first twenty minutes.

If you watched the trailers for Godzilla 2014, you probably thought that Bryan Cranston, who will from now on be known as Heisenberg (for reasons you should already know) has a prominent role to play in this movie. He's in about half of the trailer after all. I was under the impression that Heisenberg was the hero of this story (along with Godzilla of course). How could I not? Not only is he the human face of this movie, but he's far and away the best actor in it. Lies. All lies. Heisenberg is reduced to nothing more than a glorified cameo. For twenty minutes this movie had heart. It had character. It had the feels, and that's all because it had one of the best actors of the modern day in the lead role. Heisenberg was brilliant. He was literally the ONLY thing about this movie that I liked. His chemistry with Juliette Biniche, who plays his wife for a brief time, was great, and as we knew from the trailers his monologue when confronting the authorities was epic. But then they decided to kill him off, and I'm scratching my head wondering why. Its not like he NEEDED to die or anything to move the story forward. No, he needed to NOT die. It seemed to me that the whole movie got derailed the minute he left the screen. Sure it was no masterpiece even with him in it, but he's the only person in this film who either didn't overact, or stare blankly at the screen in an unemotional state for two hours. Why kill your best actor in the first twenty minutes? Especially when Kick Ass ends up being the one to replace him. The world may never know.

2. They don't do Godzilla justice.

I'm going to call it as I see it guys, Godzilla is a big fat fatty. I'm sorry if this seems nit-picky but I HATED Godzilla's look. Don't get me wrong, its not like I'm calling for a return to the chicken legged T-Rex of the 90's Godzilla, but it would have been nice if they just took the Menelial Godzilla from the Toho franchise and gave him a CGI update. I appreciate that they at least tried to stay close to the look of the original and didn't go full retard on us like they did in the 90's, but I'm sorry, they failed. Godzilla's head is too small, his body too fat, he looks more like my sister in laws retarded pug then the king of the monsters. A guy in a suit is more menacing then this monstrosity. I didn't even think they did his atomic breath right. Again, forgive me for being nit-picky, but its nowhere near the awe inspiring force of destruction it is in the Toho films. But none of that compares to the travesty of being regulated to a secondary character in his own movie. He got no origins story, no explanation as to why he suddenly appeared, or why he wants to fight the giant horny bug Pokmon (more on that later), he just sort of shows up for a little bit, fights, and then leaves. Instead of a movie about an unstoppable force of nature wreaking havoc on the world and threatening us with extinction LIKE THE TRAILER MADE US THINK, we get a movie about bug monsters that just so happens to have Godzilla in it. Why do THEY get an origins story and Godzilla does not? This isn't called ""attack of the horny bug monsters"" its called Godzilla damn it!

3. The human characters suck.

Except for Heisenberg, there is not a single character I cared for. Kick Ass isn't a terrible actor, but in this film he has the range of a baked potato. He shows little to no emotion throughout, seems to forget all about his family until its convenient for the plot for him to remember them, and shows a super human ability to survive everything from falling of gigantic bridges to monsters chasing him through the streets. Seriously, he shows the emotional range of a donkey. Someone describe his character for me please, because generic military guy is about all I got. Because yeah, everyone knows that guys in the military all stoic don't give a crap about anything people.  And THIS is who they get to pick up where Heisenberg left off? No. No no NO! He just couldn't do it. He plays Lieutenant Ford Brody, and Army EOD who we're supposed to believe despite his lowly rank (lets remember that a Lieutenant is the lowest of all officer ranks, and has little real authority) is the most important military man in the world. And the only EOD in the entire Army. Watch as he returns from a 14 month deployment, and then immediately leaves his family to fly to Japan to bail his father out of prison. Why? Because the plot needs him to be in Japan. Seriously, he doesn't even stay a night at home, he just jets off to Japan to bail out his dad. That's nothing compared to his wife though. After 14 months separated from her husband you'd think she would want him to stay for at least a little bit, right? Nope, she's the one encouraging him to go. It was so awkward I thought she must be having an affair. But no, its just a poorly written screen play with bad actors portraying poorly written characters. Outside of Kick Ass and the dearly departed Heisenberg there's really not one else in this film worth mentioning. Ken Watanabe is in it, but all he does is spout epically clich dialog in a melodramatic fashion, and then a bunch of generic military guys who say a bunch of generic military stuff. Watanabe even excited for Godzilla to show up and start destroying everything. For some reason he thinks Godzilla is a good guy. You know, after trying to nuke it to death back in the fifties. Making sense so far? No?

4. There is no reason to get emotionally invested in this movie at all.

Because the characters are so poorly written and so poorly portrayed there's little to no reason to get emotionally invested in them. This I would get if Godzilla was just trying to be a big silly monster bash but its not. It wants so desperately to be taken seriously, to effect its audience on an emotional level, but you can't do that when your characters are as clich, one dimensional, and unrelatable as they are here. Kick Ass has a wife and son, for example, but their relationship is regulated to a quick two minute scene in the very beginning before he flys away to Japan never to see them again. You want me to get emotionally involved? How about building up the family dynamic and having Kick Ass try his best to escape the city with his wife and child? How about giving them some freaking time together? How about, I don't know, having them do something except stare at the screen with a blank stare? I don't know, give me a reason, ANY reason, to get invested in them. THIS is the biggest reason they needed to keep Heisenberg. He shared maybe two minutes of screen time with his wife and her death was a real heart felt moment. I could see the pain in his eyes as he watched his wife die before his eyes. Some real heart breaking stuff there. After that we don't get anything anywhere CLOSE to it. If you want to make a movie that is emotionally involving you need to give me characters who aren't robots. Or at least not kill the characters who arent.

5. The marketing was a big fat lie.

OK, Ill admit that this may not be a complaint with the movie itself, but with the studio who marketed this film. But if you watched the trailer and then walked out of the movie feeling cheated, you aren't the only one. Im with you bro. The trailer was epic. It made Godzilla look like a movie about the king of the monsters wrecking everything, threatening the very survival of the human race, and beating up on some monsters as an added bonus. And starring Heisenberg!!! Hell yeah! Raise your hand if you thought Godzilla and Heisenberg were going to be the two biggest stars of this movie, and not Kick Ass and giant horny bug Pokmon. : Raises hand: Who thought it would have a consistent dark and serious tone with a well-known and beloved actor leading the charge against an unstoppable force of nature? :Raises hand again: Now are those unreasonable expectations considering the promotion for this film? No. Whats unreasonable is to expect anything else. Well SIKE, it was all a big fat money grabbing lie. Everything I was led to believe about this movie ended up not being anywhere close to the truth. You know its true; even if you liked the movie you know Im right. Dont try to sit here and tell me any different. Its like biting into a Twinkie after being promised fluffy marshmallow goodness and tasting a big fat turd instead.

6. The plot makes no sense.

Let me set the scene for you. Giant horny bug Pokmon #1 has just escaped a super top secret base in Japan and is now flying towards San Francisco to meet up with giant horny bug Pokmon #2 where they can then have giant bug Pokmon sex, lay a bunch of eggs (so basically the plot for 90s Godzilla), and settle down to raise a family. Meanwhile Godzilla for unexplained reason has decided hes spent enough time underwater and wants to come to the surface to kick some Pokmon butt. So whats the militarys response to THREE giant monsters converging on one of Americas largest cities? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The militarys response to this enormous threat is so weak and ineffective they might as well not have been there at all. Seriously, they don't even try to stop Godzilla from reaching America, they just kind of accept that they cant. Asian dude claims Godzilla is a good guy, and they just leave it at that. There are a few scenes where their just lazily sailing alongside his spines and no one is shooting at him! Same with the other two monsters. No one even bothers to try to kill these things.

But I think my favorite idiotic moment is when they finally decide on a plan to stop them. What is their brilliant plan? Well its to ship a nuclear weapon by train all the way to San Francisco, sail it out into the middle of the ocean, and since the monsters are attracted to radiation and Godzilla is attracted- for some reason- to the monsters, theyll kill all three with one giant blast. Sounds like a great plan, right? At least until you stop to really think about it. First off, don't we have nuclear submarines in the Pacific? Arent all those war ships and carriers powered by nuclear reactors? Why not just, I don't know, put a nuclear submarine in the ocean, evacuate it, and then just set off the nukes in it when the monsters show up? Hell, why not FLY a warhead in? Why does it have to be transported via train? I realize that the monsters can knock planes out of the sky, but only if they get close to them. Not only that, but there is literally no protection given to the train transporting the warhead besides a couple dozen soldiers. No tanks, no planes or helicopters, no HUNVEEs with 50. Caliber machine guns or Mark 19s, nothing. Not only that, but they drive it RIGHT PAST WHERE THE GIANT FREAKING MONSTER IS. What, did they lose track of where the 500 ft high monster is? Did they forget where it was? Did they lose it? Apparently, because this thing just sneaks up on the train like its a damned ninja turtle or something. Even when they hear people screaming bloody murder as they are torn to pieces over the radio, they somehow don't reach the conclusion that maybe they shouldnt take the train through the creepy tunnel and across the rickety bridge. Maybe it would be best to get a satellite picture of what the area looks like, or send a recon team to find out where those dyeing soldiers are, or SOMETHING. Simply checking to see if the bridge is intact does NOTHING to confirm that the coast is clear. Surprise, surprise, the monster shows up, eats their nuke, and leaves. Derp, guess that wasn't the best of plans, huh? Funny thing is though, they had two nukes, and it straight up LEAVES the second. Why? Hell if I know. Because the plot called for it I guess. Speaking of which

7. Plot holes, inconsistencies, and convenient plot points.

Yeah, there are a lot of them. I spoke before about how Kick Ass inexplicably leaves his family after a 14 month long deployment the day he gets back; because he had to bail his dad out of jail in Japan where it just so happens the giant Pokmon monster is waiting. Why does he go to Japan? Why doesnt he just wire his dad some money? Does his dad not have any money for his own bail? Why not wait a few days before going? Well because the plot needs him in Japan of course, and they're going to get him there one way or another. Once in Japan he inexplicably- my new favorite word - agrees to go with his crazy dad into a quarantine zone to help him find some old floppy disks that have been exposed to the elements for the last fifteen years. Why does he agree to go with his dad? Not because he believes what his father says is true, but because the plot requires him to go. Once in the quarantine zone they get caught AGAIN by the authorities, yet instead of taking them to jail as theyd done to Heisenberg before, they instead decide to transport the two to their super-secret base where the monster is being held. Their justification for this is because Heisenberg used to work there, but that doesnt make any sense. Did Heisenberg not tell them he worked there the FIRST time he got arrested? That was what, a few days prior? If that? Why the sudden need to have Heisenberg and Kick Ass present at the super-secret base? Say it with me now, because the plot needed them to be there. Its like they were reading the script or something.

Fast forward. Kick Ass is now in Nevada, I think? How did he get there? Why is he there? I don't know, anyway, he just so happens to be in a town where the nuke train just so happens to be going by, and he lets the guys in charge know hes a super important lieutenant, (a Sgt Major was apparently the highest ranking individual there, for some reason) and convinces them to let him go with the train to San Francisco. Because there are no other EOD guys going with the train. And no experts on nuclear weapons. Because the Army is stupid. OK, that part I can believe (joking, Im an Air Force guy, so of course the Army is stupid to me). Now I guess hes the only person in the entire world capable of disarming this bomb, so when they need a bunch of soldiers to make a HELO jump into the city of course hes the one they call. Never mind that hes EOD and therefor would have had no reason at all to be trained to make HELO jumps. Its certainly never established that hes ever been trained to do so. So why is he the one making this jump? Because the plot- yeah yeah yeah, I know I know.

8. Godzilla VS the giant horny bug Pokmon.

So I already talked about how silly Godzilla looked, but what about the two Mutos he has to fight? Out of the wide array of classic Toho monsters which ones did they end of going with? Rodan? Mothera? Gigan? King Ghedorah? No? Bugs you say? Bugs who just want to bone and make little babies? Umm, what? Giant horny bugs who look like Pokmon? Shirley you cant be serious. Oh but I am. I guess I don't understand why they couldn't just use one of the dozens upon dozens of classic Kiju monsters to pull from they decide instead to go with giant Pokmon look alikes. They weren't HORRIBLE, in their defense, there are plenty of Japanese monsters way worse than they (and one American Godzilla monster) but they were quite underwhelming. Seeing these lame monsters kick Godzillas butt all the way up until the end didn't help. The only saving grace about them was that they died in pretty epic ways. Thats something, I guess.

9. It doesn't learn the lessons of the last American Godzilla.

So what is the central threat these giant monsters pose to humanity? As destructive as two giant bugs running around in a major city are, thats hardly an apocalyptic threat. Just shoot them with guns and bombs until they die. Well, the threat is that they are horny and want to make a bunch of bug monster babies. So basically the plot of the 90s Godzilla. Havent we learned anything? Wasnt it stupid as hell to add that idiotic egg subplot to the first American Godzilla? Why do we need to have a do over of that horrible, horrible film? When Kick Ass manages to kill the little baby eggs we even get the mommy bug monster crying over them and chasing him through the streets just like the 90s Godzilla. Seeing how universally hated that movie is, Im not sure who thought this was a good idea.

10. The epic reveal shots and annoying cut aways.

You know what gets annoying after a while? Epic reveal shots. Now don't get me wrong, I love an epic reveal as much as the next guy, and if anyone deserves the most epic of all epic reveal shots its Godzilla. But my God, you don't need to give him a big introduction every single time we see as if weve never seen him before. We already know what he looks like, weve seen him a half dozen times before, so why on earth does the director feel the need to pretend like every time we see him is the VERY FIRST TIME? Its not necessary. But thats not even the worst part. No, the worst part is when we get that epic reveal and then it suddenly cuts away for no reason so we don't get to see any of the action. Example. The very first time we get a full body shot of Godzilla is when hes confronting the first giant bug monster in Honolulu. He comes out of the water, hes wrecking everything, but we don't actually get to see him. Everything is building to Godzillas first big fight with the Muto. He steps in front of the camera, it slowly pans up so we can see him in all his fatty glory. He bends down and roars as loud and awesomely as he can. Oh damn, its about to go down! Godzilla and Muto are going to fight!!! SIKE! Instead they cut away to a news reel and show about five seconds worth of fighting. This kind of nonsense just kept happening too. Every time the movie geared up for an epic fight it would suddenly cut away to robotic Kick Ass, or a news reel, or something lame, because no one who pays to see a Godzilla movie could possibly want to see Godzilla fight.

But there are a couple things I liked about Godzilla 2014.
1. The Special effects were pretty good.
2. Heisenberg was amazing.
And thats about it really. The first twenty minutes, you know, the part with Heisenberg in it, were actually pretty darn good. Thats about all I can say in this films defense.",1400371200,33,18490,4.341914955163436
5955809,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I can't say that I didn't enjoy this movie. It was visually interesting and had extremely good special effects. The story was ok and the characters were a bit boring (Except for 2 that died early, 1 that was a convenience, and 2 that were animals). Just because the characters in the movie didn't really do anything that logical and that there were some major problems didn't make the movie any less fun to see however. One thing that did affect me however were the characters and how undeveloped and boring they were. This made some of the parts that were supposed to be suspenseful boring and some of the parts that were supposed to be sad more 'meh.' I would probably buy this movie especially for the first 30 to 45 minutes and the last 30 minutes. It is good enough to at least rent.

Now for Spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie or just don't care, read on.

I have to say, the trailers gave a much different picture of the movie than what it actually was (When is this not true?). However, Brian Cranston's role in the movie was much overplayed. I thought his character was one of the deepest and best in the movie. However he only has say 30 minutes of screen-time. You actually don't see any monster fighting action until later in the movie when you see it on a news broadcast. I admit that it probably took a large amount of their budget to film these sequences, but a bit more Godzilla earlier instead of teasing would have been better for me. The trailers already teased it enough! I wanted to see Godzilla lay waste to stuff. For the last 30 minutes he did. Who could say that it wasn't awesome when Godzilla puked fire into that Muto's mouth and actually believe it? That was awesome! I just wish that there was more Brian Cranston and more Godzilla in this movie.

Anyways it was a fun movie and I would watch it again.

I must make this comparison, but comparing Godzilla to Pacific Rim is like comparing Arma to Battlefield in this way. Godzilla was much more 'realistic' in its giant city sized smackdowns than Pacific Rim was.

However, (sorry Godzilla) I have to say that I preferred Pacific rim to Godzilla.",1400371200,5,2131,4.453846153846154
5955810,4,B00EXPOCXY,"*(Gojira).  Theatrical review.

I remember being taken by surprise in 2010 with a small Mexican made film called ""Monsters.""  I loved the movie and here is the same director making only his second feature film.  A big difference is a much larger budget and a cast of A-list actors.  Godzilla movies go back, of course, to the original 1954 Japanese film (""Gojira"") which was followed by a series of bad sequels including the 1998 Roland Emmerich flop.

With the exception of Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays Ford, the son of nuclear scientists, none of the actors really do much but stand around in awe or in the case of Ford's dad (Bryan Cranston), rant excitedly.  Sandra (Juliette Binoche), doesn't stick around long.  Ford's wife Elle is played by Elizabeth Olsen but she is relegated to fits of worry about her hubby.  Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are the scientists who originally discover there are sleeping giants under the sea.

Essentially, the film is a modern day reboot of the original in most respects.  Earthquakes destroy a nuclear facility in Japan, but the fallout is mysteriously contained for 15 years.  Then giant creatures are unearthed called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms).  Hell, I identified them.  Remember Mothra?  There are 2, one a male, can fly.  The other one is larger and a female and she has an incubator full of babies ready to burst.  Godzilla, who appears to be an island in the Pacific (seriously), arises from a deep slumber and is hungry for a MUTO sandwich.  Dr. Serizawa's (Watanabe) take on this whole event is to allow Godzilla to go after the MUTOs unencumbered.  He has concluded that they are natural enemies.

As they move toward the U. S. and their nuclear arsenal (which the monsters love to eat), the American military devise a plan to blow them all to smithereens with an H-Bomb.  While there is a satisfactory lead up the big gunfight at high noon, the movie really gets rolling when the big boys go at each other.  To be clear, these are some big scary monsters.  These guys aren't King Kong big or T-Rex big, they are skyscraper big.  The idea of creating such large creatures is genius.  They aren't necessarily even evil.  They are just damn big animals and they knock down stuff in their way, including towering buildings and bridges.  The special effects here are noteworthy, the direction is first rate.  A sequel should be in the works soon.",1400371200,5,2423,4.801452784503632
5955811,5,B00EXPOCXY,"(Warning, here be spoilers)

Well. It's been quite a while since I've done a big review like this, and I don't think any film is more deserving than Godzilla. There's a number of reasons the hype around it has been monumental as of late; it's the first American Godzilla movie since 1998's failed attempt at giving Hollywood its own Godzilla; it's the first Godzilla movie in ten years altogether since the rather disappointing 2004 film ""Final Wars; and it's being released on the 60th anniversary of Godzilla. And I must add, it's the first truly impressive film of the summer; it starts the summer movie season off in fine style, and hopefully it's the beginning of many more Godzilla movies to come. Wishful thinking? Maybe, but this Godzilla will for sure have lots of longevity, if I do say so myself.

The film is the closest to perfection any Godzilla movie has been since 1954. That's a bold statement, but it's the first film since the 1954 movie that's been ever-so-close to total perfection. It's everything you want in a Godzilla movie, and everything you don't know you want, too. There is but a small gripe I have with the film that prevents it from being perfect, but I'll explain that later. I've seen the movie twice as of writing, and I can tell you it's stayed with me since.

The film is already impressive off the bat with the opening titles. The opening titles are similar to the 1998 movie, with the titles being shown over footage of nuclear tests, but they're done way better here. Whereas in 1998 we are treated to generic font over what looks like footage that was shot through a jar of urine, here we're shown old newsreel footage, and every credit is shown in paragraphs, designed to look like they're ripped straight from scientific reports. The non-credit parts are suddenly whited-out to show the ""DIRECTED BY GARETH EDWARDS"" type stuff. In addition, Alexandre Desplat's score is just magnificent. It's not the typical Hans Zimmer ""BWOOOOONG"" that seems dominant in tons of music scores today. In fact, the score is very nostalgic throughout, with some influence taken from classic blockbusters and even Bernard Herrman's Hitchcock scores, with even a dash of Cliff Martinez.

The bulk of the film follows Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson. Much of the first half deals with his complicated relationship with his father Joe (Bryan Cranston)- in fact, near the beginning of the film, we see the tragedy that has estranged them both- they lived in Japan in 1999, when Ford was (I think- they never quite make it clear how old he is) 12 years old. At the Janjira power plant in Janjira, something of a large earthquake happens which causes a radiation burst, causing Joe to lose his wife (Juliette Binoche) in the disaster. Fifteen years later, Ford is an EOD in the American military, has a wife named Elle (Elizabeth Olson) and an adorable little boy named Sam. On the very night he arrives home from service, he gets a call from officials, telling him that Joe was arrested for trespassing in a quarantine area. So he heads to Japan to sort things out with his dad, who reveals that he was in the area where their house was, to get floppy discs containing data about the disaster. So they go to the house the next day only to find that there's no radiation left, and they get the discs, only to be arrested- AGAIN, and taken to the Janjira plant.

This is where we are introduced to the central conflict: the MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism). There's a large, nest-like object at the plant, and after some interrogation, the officials at the plant- in particular, a pair of researchers named Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins), who suddenly notice what he's talking about and realize he is indeed correct. The nest looks about ready to hatch, and officials order the workers to kill it- but they fail, and  we get our first glimpse of the MUTO. These things look like a cross between tarantulas and bats- they're huge, and absolutely TERRIFYING. After an attack at the plant, the military is ordered to follow the MUTO wherever it goes.

Now I know what you're thinking at this point. ""What about Godzilla, that IS what the movie is called. Right?"" Well, here it's where they reveal Godzilla. In the military carrier named the USS Saratoga, Ford is brought into a room where they show him footage of supposed nuclear tests on 1954 that weren't, in fact, tests. They were attempts to kill the creature they call, ""Gojira"". It is revealed that Gojira is on the move too, but they don't know where. And at this point, it's an hour into the film, and we get our first glimpse of the beast here. In Hawaii, the MUTO from earlier in the movie and a wing-less MUTO attack. One has knocked a submarine into the rainforest and another is attacking the airport. At the airport is where we see the titular creature. After a tsunami, he appears, and stomps over to the airport in what might be one of the coolest reveals I've ever seen. A full pan up his body to his face revealing a horrifying sinister grin, before he lets out his infamous ""SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOONNNNNKKKKK!!!"" roar that has made him such a household name.

I'll stop with the spoiling right there because the rest is too good. It's true that Godzilla's screentime is mostly limited to the final act, but the thing is, that is hardly a problem because the rest of the film surrounding his appearance is so good. There's tons of suspense and intrigue. One thing the film really does good is show how substantial the damage is- not by showing the attacks outright but showing the aftermath- the presence of the MUTO attacks is felt through those shots, which only makes the actual attack that much more horrifying. The film does a good job at making us care for the characters too, and you also really hope that Ford will make it home on time too.

The cinematography in the film is just magnificent. I fully recommend the IMAX experience- in fact, for the cinematography alone the price is worth it. The aerial shots of Japan, San Francisco, Hawaii, etc. in particular are just awesome. Gareth Edwards' direction is magnificent and he has an eye for detail. Whereas most monster/disaster movies show the attacks and what not outright, he chooses to limit your perspective of the attacks and what not to small doses. This is incredibly effective so then you won't feel tired of the film by the time the final battle swings around. One problem I have with the Transformers movies is that by the time the final battle swings around, I've sat through so much destruction and chaos that I'm ready for it to end, my arse becomes numb and there really is no reason for it to be as long as it is. That isn't the case with Godzilla. It's just a few minutes over two hours, and it goes by very quickly. Transformers feels like it's ten hours long, but Godzilla makes such good use of its runtime that it goes by quickly, and if anything, you wouldn't mind if it went on for longer because your attention is held firmly.

And yes, I am indeed praising the rather limited Godzilla screentime. By the time Godzilla shows up for the final battle, you've gone for so long without him that you don't even care he's been out of the movie for so long, and that is because the scenes with the MUTOs are satisfying, the drama is satisfying, and the characters work. The final battle is spectacular. The battle starts when Big G and the MUTO arrive in San Francisco, and it does indeed cut away quite a bit, but not like it bothers me at all. We see a whole battle in full when the HALO Jump bit as seen in the trailers begins. The battle itself is just wicked, if you're like me and you took great joy in watching a guy in a ridiculous rubber suit battling another guy in a rubber suit, the battle feels almost like an updated version of that. Garett's attention to detail also shows here- when we finally see his atomic breath, his spines light up one by one, only making it more exciting. Godzilla is just brutal on the MUTO, but the MUTO also are pretty brutal, given the size. And yes, Godzilla is indeed seen as an anti-hero in the film. He has no quarrel with the humans and only intends on killing the MUTO and nobody else. He still leaves people dead in his wake, but it's clear he doesn't intend to and is happy to be away from civilization.

Oh, and the final minute of the movie is amazing too. I won't give it away, but it's chilling. Synced with Desplat's score, it's just beautiful.

Overall, I give the film a 9/10. Not since The Avengers has the summer season started off so satisfyingly. If I had one gripe, it's a small one at that, it's that there is a bit too much MUTO screentime, but that doesn't take away too much. I strongly advise you to see this film with the biggest screen possible- IMAX especially. I saw it in AVX and while it was satisfying there, IMAX was even better. I for sure look forward to seeing it a third time, and eventually owning the movie when it comes out on blu-ray- in fact, I can't wait already to hear Big G's roar shake my BOSE sound system!!!",1400371200,7,9135,4.580428134556575
5955812,4,B00EXPOCXY,"I confess that I went into this movie with low expectations. I don't think I've ever watched any Godzilla movies ever. But I really enjoyed this movie. Fantastic special effects. Fantastic premise. And fantastic monsters. I loved how the movie just showed glimpses of Godzilla in the beginning, mostly the triceratops back moving along the ocean like a Lochness Monster. And then when you see him in all his magnificent glory, just wow. Also, rather than numb me with fight scene after fight scene, the director saved the impressive fight sequences between Mutos #1 + 2 and Godzilla until the end. Well done.

Now for the actors. Juliette Binoche seemed completely random and wasted here. But that one devastating scene between her and Brian Cranston, with her face framed by the glass between them was haunting. Brian Cranston was fantastic, especially in that scene in the makeshift interview room - glimpses of Walter White there. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was suitably hot and heroic. But what kind of direction did the director give Ken Watanabe? ""Just look dumbfounded and idiotic in every scene????"" He was completely wasted here as well. It just seemed like he was a token Japanese character in a Japanese franchise gone American. Oh, well.",1400371200,7,1243,5.033980582524272
5955813,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Nine Things About ""Godzilla"" [USA, 2014]

1. In 1954, Japan made the movie Gojira, about a giant monster with atomic breath that destroyed Tokyo. It was openly symbolic of the power and terror of atomic weapons, which Japan was so familiar with from World War II. The movie was re-edited and released in America with the name Godzilla, King of the Monsters, because Godzilla is what Gojira kind of sounds like to American ears. It cut out a lot of the nuclear themes and political overtones.

2. Even though Gojira/Godzilla was killed at the end of the movie, it was so popular that there was a sequel. He just suddenly wasn't dead any more. Then the Japanese made 26 more Godzilla movies, and America made two more, (including the horrible Matthew Broderick version from 1998). I think Ive seen most of those movies - Godzilla was a staple of my childhood.

3. In 2014, sixty years after the first movie, we have the 31st Godzilla movie. Its called Godzilla. And it is a pretty kick-ass reboot that takes it old-school, all the way back to the original.

4. Its directed by Gareth Edwards, who directed the really cool indie movie Monsters that nobody saw. If you are one of the few people that watched it, you would know Edwards was a good choice to bring Godzilla back.

5. Its about an earthquake in the Philippines that wakes up some giant bug creature that is attracted to radiation. Seriously, it eats nuclear weapons. Anyway, it starts calling out to something and Godzilla wakes up, hears it, and starts to hunt it (if you listen carefully, you will hear the Japanese expert scientist pronounce his name Gojira - and all the Americans immediately start saying Godzilla).

6. This is a pretty epic adventure film, with a real story. But thats also my problem with the movie - theres almost too much story. Theres hardly any room for the monsters. It takes an hour for Godzilla to officially show up.

7. When the monster battles do happen, they go big. They really bring back the feel and style of the old Japanese movies. And nobody can deny that Godzilla is still a boss.

8. The nuclear weapon theme is prominent in this movie, as it was in the original Japanese version. But there is an extra message too - humans don't really run the planet. Godzilla and the other monsters work out their beef wherever they can, even if it is in a major American city. They have no feelings for or against humans. They don't try to kill us, but if we get in their way, then too bad for us. Humans are proud and stupid and ultimately powerless against the raw forces of nature.

9. Except for the fact that we don't see enough of the title character, Godzilla is a well done action-adventure giant monster movie. Fans of the old Godzilla should be pleased, and it may even hook a new generation of fans.",1400371200,5,2799,4.537698412698413
5955814,3,B00EXPOCXY,"This is the third time in my life that Godzilla has made a comeback to the silver screen, `Godzilla 1985,' and the 1998 `Godzilla' with Matthew Broderick. This doesn't even count the Godzilla sequels that were made by Toho Studios in the 60's which I never saw in a theater because by then they had so devolved into campy set smashing romps (and have an equivalency with Elvis movies) it didn't seem real to my unsophisticated mind. To be honest, after seeing the 1998 version of `Godzilla' I felt better about that movie when I was walking out of the theater than I did with this version.

The main problem with the movie seems to be is that its three movies stitched together to make a quilt of a `Godzilla' movie. The first section (and the most interesting plot thread) features Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody, a nuclear engineer working at a power plant in Japan which is experiencing seismic events, not earthquakes because earthquakes are random but these have a pattern. His wife, Sandra (Juliette Binoche) also works at the plant and he sends her down into the bowels of the plant with a team to investigate the possibility of an equipment failure. As her team goes deeper into the plant the seismic activity recurs and increases causing a breach the plant, radiation is spreading through the plants lower levels, and it must be sealed. Sandra and her team don't make it out and Joe has to witness his wife's death by radiation poisoning. Witnessing the destruction of the nuclear power plant from his school is their son, Ford Brody.

The second part picks up 15 years later, approximately today with the now grown up Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) returning from probably Afghanistan (the movie doesn't specify) and after a brief reunion with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son, Ford is soon informed that his father Joe has been arrested in Japan for entering the quarantine zone where their house used to be near the power plant. After a rapprochement, Joe convinces Ford to go to the quarantine zone with him whereupon they're almost immediately arrested and taken to the nuclear power plant that is still generating power but for a totally different reason than providing power for Japan. Here we meet Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) the new director of the power plant. When seismic events again shake the power plant a creature called a M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) is born. The third part is tracking the M.U.T.O., the discovery of a second M.U.T.O., and the reawakening of Godzilla as a balancing power of nature.

Out of all three of these plot lines the movie misses the story that would tie it all nicely together, and that is the Joe Brody plot line. Cranston has turned from a comedic actor to a fine dramatic actor and his scenes are some the best acted in the movie, but also his plot line is the most interesting! His nuclear engineer has discovered that nuclear tests in the late 40's and early 50's weren't tests at all but an attempt to kill Godzilla. And Cranston has some of the best lines in the movie that have been used in the ads. The makers of the trailer knew which was the best plot line, how come director Gareth Edwards didn't?

The theme of ""Godzilla"" has always been that he's a metaphor for mans meddling with powers of nature he doesn't understand, and in Godzilla that has always been nuclear power. In the original 1954 film it's no accident the scenes in the wake of Godzilla's destruction resembled the films of the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it was obvious to contemporary audiences. And the film is right on the edge of getting the theme right! Centering on unexplained events at a nuclear power plant and a quarantine area, and a nuclear clean up, the film could have exploited our fears and uncertainty of nuclear power, but they just miss it, and that's probably from having a screenplay written by committee. As a theme the case for Godzilla being a balancing force of nature is never fully made.

The cast includes some notable actors such as Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn. Watanabe walks around just looking in near catatonic shock and David Strathairn's Admiral Stenz (a weird homage to ""L.A. Confidential"" in that name?) could have been played by anyone (as could Binoche`s role). You could interchange Sam Elliott's General Ross from Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" and no one would notice.

The monsters look great, Godzilla never looked better and less like a man in a rubber suit, the M.U.T.O's look fine. The last half hour is a tag-team match of wrestling monsters wrecking San Francisco. It isn't a matter of technology anymore to making the special effects look real, but hooking the story together with the special effects to make a coherent film. I'm sure some people will go to see ""Godzilla"" just to see the monsters smash cities (people at the theater I saw it at cheered at the end), but ""Godzilla"" seems a missed opportunity to merge a story, to give you a reason to suspend disbelief and believe that somehow a creature like Godzilla could exist with the special effects that in the end sell the entire concept. If Amazon allowed half stars this would be 2.5 stars.",1400371200,7,5173,4.742222222222222
5955815,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Pity poor Bryan Cranston. Sure, he's at the top of the world between ""Breaking Bad"" and his Broadway hit playing LBJ, but in the new ""Godzilla"" he looks like an idiot. The cast of ""Godzilla"" is not only solid but distinguished--Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Taylor-Johnson--but the others get to mutter their silly lines and collect their paychecks, while Cranston is actually expected to emote. Because the human story in the new ""Godzilla"" is so perfunctory, Cranston looks ridiculous getting tremulously sorrowful over what, in the end, is just another Fall Down Go Boom movie with spectacular special effects.

Richard Corliss of ""Time"" hit the nail on the head when he said the trailer for ""Godzilla"" promised a far more moving, powerful cinematic experience than the actual movie. The three gigantic, CGI-created monsters are genuinely impressive, and the scenes of Tokyo, Honolulu, Las Vegas and especially San Francisco being laid waste create new standards for cinematic shock and awe. But the story is dull, the continuity terrible, and the actors superfluous. The filmmakers even advance the idea that we're supposed to admire Godzilla for destroying the other two monsters, never mind that Godzilla has killed just as many people and destroyed just as many buildings as the others. I recommend this film only to viewers who value special effects above all.",1400371200,11,1436,5.298245614035087

5955818,3,B00EXPOCXY,"When putting Godzilla as the title of a movie and using his face to market a film you'd expect a lot more of the monster than you get in this average and underwhelming attempt at a Godzilla film. It spends forty-five minutes with human characters, unnecessary exposition, and eventually gets to a monster that winds up being some generic creation that looks like the creature from Cloverfield. By the time you finally get to Godzilla you're so bored that any little bits of action would sate you.

Thankfully, the giant monsters fighting each other is exciting and the movie isn't afraid to destroy a lot of infrastructure. Sadly, these awesome fights are  typically cut when it looks like it's getting good so we can watch the main characters family do something boring, or the Navy do something boring.

Our main character is in an EOD unit and the movie insists to follow him and his human companions, rather than the monster most moviegoers paid to see. The human characters are all cardboard and have the acting chops of a middle school film production. About twenty minutes of the movie was exciting enough to sate my thirst for giant monsters, which is about a sixth of the film. So that sixth of the film I recommend.

The rest is pretty much garbage. Dumb plot, bad characters, some cringe-worthy writing. There are some really excellent and beautiful shots and I can commend those, but it's otherwise basic summer blockbuster fare. I should have gone in knowing this would be a military film with giant monsters rather than a monster film with military. Because God forbid an American Godzilla movie be about the monster.

What could this movie benefited from? More monster fighting, less cuts in the middle of the monster fighting, an actual Godzilla villain (Why not include Mothra or a classic monster rather than the generic ones we're given?), cutting down the way too stretched out first act. Elongating the last act.

I can't wholly suggest this movie to anyone. It's average. It's better than America's last attempt at a Godzilla film but it ain't hard to be better than that shlock. A 2.5/5",1400371200,8,2109,4.796143250688705

Alleged scientist babbling about ""natural order"" - well, the stereotype varies, but he suddenly gets this spiritual ""nature is good"" vibe out of nowhere, with the bland assumption that ""nature's balance"" must inevitably balance in our favor.

Great effects, of course, These days, they're all great. I have to admit, I took special delight in seeing Las Vegas knocked to shreds. And, among the monsters, the whole 'mommy' thing worked really well., like in Alien Resurrection. Good flick, exceptional addition to the Godzilla canon, but nothing for the ages.

5955820,4,B00EXPOCXY,"2014 marks the 60th Anniversary of GODZILLA & after 28 films by Toho, Hollywood is knocking on big lizard's door. This marks the second time to bring an American GODZILLA to the big screen, while the first attempt made back in 1998 ending up with disastrous results. Thankfully, this new reboot is in good hands. GODZILLA 2014 is a damn good film, a really fun cinematic experience. Warner Bros & Legendary had pretty much pull a Christopher Nolan on GODZILLA, in other words they turn a BATMAN & ROBIN into a BATMAN BEGINS. This new GODZILLA heads back to it's 1954's original roots. For that it's a much darker & grounded in a reality, but has that throwback to the 1950 B-movies into the mix. With a very solid cast, easily the best performance goes to Bryan Cranston, despite only in it as an supporting role. For all you BREAKING BAD fans, don't expect a lot of screen time with Cranston, but what we are giving is fantastic. Not to mention GODZILLA's screen time is quite minimum here. I don't have a problem with this to be honest, it's really a slow built up to his appearance. Much like the Great White from JAWS or the Xenomorph from ALIEN, having a big reveal can leave a more lasting impact & be remembered fondly. Just be patient & stay with it, because once The King makes his grand entrance it does not disappoint. With stunning visual effects & an outstanding sound effects, when you hear GODZILLA's roar, you can feel it. Being that this is director Garrett Edward second feature film, there's no doubt he has a bright future ahead of him. Overall, GODZILLA does live up to expectations. It's something familiar, but breathe new life into this iconic creature. With a third act that is a crowd pleaser that will bring excitement & will make you feel like kid again. I cannot highly recommended it enough. It's a full-price, see it on a weekend in a pack theater & on the biggest screen with great sound system.

5955821,3,B00EXPOCXY,"I was really looking forward to this new Godzilla film. The trailers made it look scary, epic and action-filled.

When they finally show him, they pull away and go to another scene with either Lieutenant Ford Brody or his wife and son.

Years after a radiation leak at a Nuclear plant, some monsters called MUTOs begin to awaken and terrorize the world. The scientists believe that the only thing powerful enough to stop them is the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla.

5955824,4,B00EXPOCXY,"In all honesty, the history of Godzilla is not my forte.  What I do know is that, like Superman, Godzilla is a character (a kind reference since monster would be a better description) that largely everyone has at least heard of and could pick out of a police line-up.  Other than that, the western hemisphere has a rather reclusive relationship with the oversized lizard-like creature, as Godzilla rarely dons the big screen in North America.  The most recent Godzilla flick (domestically) to receive a wide release was in 1998  starring Matthew Broderick, which was met with negative reviews and lack of enthusiasm.  Still, they say time heals all wounds, but has a 16-year absence made the hearts of moviegoers grow fonder for Gojira (thats Japanese for Godzilla)?

Warning!  Minors Spoilers are included in this review.  Nothing drastic, but if you don't want any plot details  refrain from reading any further.

Directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters), Godzilla stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lieutenant Ford Brody and Bryan Cranston as his father, Joe.  The film begins several years prior when Ford is a young boy and his father is a nuclear plant supervisor in a town outside Tokyo, Japan.  An abrupt explosion and radiation leak, allegedly attributed to an earthquake, leads to the complete contamination of the area and a tragedy that will forever change the lives of the Brody family.

In the present day, Joe is hopelessly obsessed with the accident  which he doesnt believe was an earthquake.  Ford has just returned home from a military tour to the loving embrace of his wife, Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), and their young son.  Soon after his arrival home, hes informed that his father has been arrested for trespassing in the restricted zone where the accident took place.  After flying to Japan to meet his father, another accident proves Joes theory correct  along with proof that the government has been secretly keeping a large insect-looking monster subdued (and is the source of the disastrous tremors).

The creature manages to free itself, revealing that it feeds off nuclear power (and send out electromagnetic pulses that kill technology).  Shortly thereafter, another creature (its mate) begins terrorizing cities, too.  One of the scientists working on the creatures is Dr. Ichiro Serizawak (Ken Watanabe), who is also modestly aware of Godzillas existence  a large water based creature that was supposedly killed from the bomb dropping on Hiroshima during World War II.  He believes Godzilla is alive, and will return to defeat the attacking monsters as a means of restoring balance and order to the world.  Regardless, the U.S. military cant rely on a creature to save them, prompting them to concoct their own means of defeating the destructive creatures.

In comparison to the 1998 version of Godzilla, this 2014 reboot is far superior in every conceivable manner.  The main issue that hampered the 98 film was that it resembled too much Jurassic Park and not enough good ol fashioned monster chaos.  To this new films credit, which is a story conceived by David Callaham (The Expendables), this Godzilla is about as realistic a monster movie as anyone could possibly imagine.  Yes, theres an abundance of buildings toppling over while freaking, feisty pre-historic animals run-a-muck in every direction, yet at no point does this flick feel overly hokey or disingenuous.  Ultimately, if the world were to be overcome by overgrown monsters, the military would likely respond in the exact manner as they do in this picture.

Like the majority of movies that focus on monsters and destruction, theres no particular reason to overanalyze the acting  even regardless of whos in the starring roles.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson, best known for his lead in the Kick-Ass films, is surprisingly unrecognizable  all decked out in military attire and sporting a clean-cut look.  He carries the film adequately, yet its difficult to say hes a vital actor in this role.  Honestly, Bryan Cranston exudes nearly all of the dramatic juice in his quest to get to the bottom of whats happening in the Japanese restricted area.  Elizabeth Olsen chimes in here and there as the only dominant female presence (other than the angry, pregnant monster), yet she often feels out of place and superfluous.  Regardless, at the end of the day  everyone comes to see Godzilla.

Brace yourself, folks  because Godzilla doesnt show his face until roughly an hour into the movie.  Oddly enough, the insect-looking bad guys each received additional screen time in order to present Godzilla as the good guy  as opposed to the villain of the story, like in the 98 version.  When the fire-breathing Godzilla does rear that recognizable mug (screaming like nobodys business), he (or she) is ready for battle.  Sadly, though, just when you think Godzilla is about to go toe-to-toe with the opponents, the majority of the action is skipped  picking-up with the aftermath.  Apparently, this was an attempt to reserve the full-blown action for the climax.  The problem with that is you're left (lets be honest here) with the minimal amount of time for the films actual attraction.

Overall, Godzilla is an above average monster movie that will maintain your attention for the duration and eventually, send you home happy  but it doesnt overly scream blockbuster sensation.  The undeniable complaint about the film is the fact that it leans hard on the plot  meaning Godzillas screen time is lower than it needed to be due to the progression of the storyline.  Family ties play a large role in the lives of the main characters, but have no fear  those subjective plot points are all tied up very nicely.  So if you're expecting a cliffhanger to point to a sequel, theres none to be had here.  In the end, if you're a fan of cataclysmic destruction or monster movies, youll be in Heaven with what this new interpretation of Godzilla has to offer.  Its direct and to the point  a bit heavy on CGI at times (to be expected), but in general, it should appease all those that had a great deal of anticipation going into this flick.

5955825,5,B00EXPOCXY,"When you go into this movie you will be blown away once the monsters start fighting. Godzilla is back and looks so badass it's not even funny. He uses his atomic breath! The monster fight scenes were awesome. I thought the cast was pretty good just as well but the real stars like in Pacific Rim is the monsters. The fight scenes aren't as good as Pacific Rim but they are great. I mean yes the two MUTO's Godzilla fights are generic but look awesome. The fight scenes alone and a lot of the action pieces and sequences are reasons for me giving this 5 stars. Go see it and enjoy it! The other two films you should see this summer that look great are X-men 7 and Transformers 4. Here's to hoping they make a Godzilla/Transformers crossover or a Pacific Rim/Godzilla crossover.

I know that the 1998 version was pretty stupid but at least the movie had Godzilla in it and the movie was about Godzilla. This new Godzilla film is not so much about Godzilla, is more about MUTO and the damage he does. Is at the end that we see Godzilla fighting MUTO and unfortunately the fight was heavily interrupted by blah! blah! blah!

I also know that the original 1954 film doesn't have to much action until near the end but at least the movie was about Godzilla and it was the first time that we see Godzilla in a movie. This new Godzilla film is sooo slow and boring but I have to admit that the CG special effects were spectacular and Godzilla looks way cooler than the 1998 version. I just hope that the sequel will make up for this borefest.

5955829,5,B00EXPOCXY,"As a Godzilla fan since I was 3 or 4 watching the dubbed version of Godzilla 1985 I have to say I loved the movie greatly. Gareth Edwards in my mind did everything right and made a good movie not just worthy of the title Godzilla, but also made a spectacular addition for any Godzilla fan or Kaiju fan period. Going based off the footage seen in the trailers and from I have seen in the theater which I am not going to mention, Gareth does things in the movie that has not been done or rarely touched on in the 81 some years of Giant Monsters destroying cities starting with King Kong back in 1933. He takes on a different aspect of Godzilla from established lore. Sure there are critics saying Godzilla could have had more screen time, but you know what there is no set formula on making these movies. We Americans since the yearly comic book movie phase had started in 1998 with Blade we have acquired a taste for super hero movies. A taste that needs to be shaken a bit.

 Is Godzilla the right movie to do so? Probably not, but I'm hoping so. After all I have friends, classmates, and co-workers of mine who are not and I repeat ARE NOT G-Fans tell me that they and their friends/family members/classmates are anticipating the movie and were more interested in seeing it over The Amazing SpiderMan 2.

5955830,3,B00EXPOCXY,"Just walked out of the movie theater with my dad....and we're both thinking the same thing. Wow, that was-meh.
I have a poster in my room for this movie, it is of Godzilla's tail. Sadly, it describes my opinion of this movie. WHERE IS GOJIRA? I WANNA SEE MORE OF HIM THAN SMOKEY SCREEN-SHOTS!!!!!!!!!!!
I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR SAD, GENERARIC  BACK STORY, EVERYONE ACTION HERO HAS ONE! LETS SEE SOME KAIJU ACTION! AND WHY IS HE SO FAT?! HOW MUCH RADIATION DID YOU FEED MY 'ZILLA?! WHY IS FORD (MAIN CHARACTER) THE ONLY ONE LEFT AFTER EACH SQUAD HE'S IN IS KILLED?

Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It was okay, a better way to spend Friday night than at home. But for Pete's sakes the 1950's and 1998 ones were WAY BETTER than this. Yeah, yeah, ""Oh 1998 wasn't good enough. NYA NYA NYA"" I don't mean to be rude and I'm sorry if I offend, but I grew up with '98 and later grew to love the 1956 one. Their plot lines are more believable; END OF STORY. There is too much focus on goverment cover ups, the humans talk most of the movie, the bat-things steal the show, and the big guy only gets a few parts beating the snot out of the male and female bat-things and even then the smoke follows him around. Oh and word to the military ships: when there is a giant lizard swimming DONT SAIL RIGHT BESIDE HIM! Giant EMP spewing bats? DONT FLY JETS NEAR IT! IT'S COMMON-SENSE, HUMANS. GET SOME!
Sorry about the rant, those things just irk me... :(

All in all, this movie was--alright. It could have been worse. The charecter design satisfies me (Zilla's foot was pretty fat though...) I am glad Gojira was the hero instead of the bad guy. (It was so cool when his back-spines lit up and he breathed fire for the first time and it wasn't with some old school special effects!)
If you are a Kaiju fan, like Godzilla, or just like giant things destroying stuff, go see this movie. The sound system in the theater was worth it. Yes, it's kinda genaric and I did get a little sleepy towards the end, but it was what it was, okay-ish.
At least this movie didn't have a bunch of half naked women... a little kissy-touchy when Ford comes home in the begining, but nothing bad I can remember at the moment. This exclusion pleases me. :3

If the theater isn't your style (like me. this was a one-time, ""lets go see our favorite monster"" thing) WAIT FOR RED-BOX.
Pacific-Rim was much better and i regret not seeing it when it was on the big screen. This movie was all ""screech!"" and ""rawh!"" and hype on an old name.
So I conclude this reveiw to crawl back to my stockpile of old movies (Godzilla 1998, Pacific Rim, Jurrasic Park, etc.) and enjoy the time my dad and I had poking fun at the ""bats on stilts"" and being mad at the people that chatted non-stop behind us.
Yes ma'am, that is Godzilla, there's only one giant lizard in this movie CALLED GODZILLA. Oh that bat-thing? That's a MOTAT(?) I'm not sure because you were TALKING! Honestly, that reason alone is why no one goes to movies any more...plus this DVD will be $9 on Amazon come Christmas...or in the $5 bin.
Three stars for this movie! It entertained me and was not insane like all the filth showing in other theaters. Have a nice day!",1400284800,13,3185,4.32998324958124
5955831,1,B00EXPOCXY,"Perhaps my biggest mistake with this film was going in with such high expectations.  I had huge expectations for this film, so high in fact that I could not sit still this entire week because I was so excited to be seeing it at 7PM on Thursday.  Having said that, I feel that I have been cheated.  As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I went into this film expecting to have about 50% general plot/human interactions and 50% knock-down, drag-out battle royale between the MUTOs and Godzilla.  In reality, I witnessed about 90% general plot/human interactions and 10% monster mayhem.  I would also like to point out that for a film titled ""Godzilla"", the titular monster is barely in the film.  For me, that is an enormous cheat.

I will give credit in that Godzilla's design was flawless, and i appreciated that his trademark roar was kept in for this outing.  With that being said, I wish that more of the film were as exciting as the last 15 minutes.  The final battle was absolutely perfect, but I feel cheated in that we did not see more of Godzilla showing why he is labeled a god.

I also felt cheated that the majority of the monster showdowns were cut.  An example of this would be when Godzilla is finally unveiled in all of his glory.  Right as he begins to face off with a MUTO, the scene cuts to yet another tedious ""people"" scene.  It happens again when people in ransacked California are taking shelter in a subway tunnel, and right as Godzilla prepares to face the MUTO, it once again cuts away.  I like to have plot with my action, but there was far more plot than action, and in all the wrong places.

There were two subtle hints in the film as to what (or who) will arrive for the next installment.  I sincerely hope that Gareth Edwards takes heed of feedback for this film and gives us a spectacular showdown for the next installment, lest those characters be as wasted as Godzilla was in this one.

With all of this being said, the night was not an entire loss. At one point in the evening, the movie broke and was delayed for repairs.  During the break, a patron shone a flashlight on the screen while two other patrons held up their respective Godzilla and Ghidorah figurines and put on a shadow puppet fight while we waited for the film to resume.  Dare I say, I think that that might have entertained me more than the film entire.

In closing, I feel truly swindled by this film and will not be buying it on DVD or Bluray.  Better luck next time, Mr. Edwards.",1400198400,34,2474,4.405286343612334
5955832,4,B00EXPOCXY,"This Godzilla is everything the 1998 film wasn't. However, the director Gareth Edwards seems to think we only care about the human point of view. Through most of Godzilla he pans away from the big fights we want to see, back to the human story we can care less about. Not to mention, this should have been Bryan Cranston's movie if we had to have things from the human perspective throughout. He owns the trailer and does own the scenes he is given.
  What makes me still love the film though is that it is a kickass monster flick. When Godzilla is finally allowed by Edwards to do what he does best people were applauding in the audience. Edwards' direction is very skillfull and he does know how to tease the viewer. He kind of just teases too often though. Roland Emmerich could learn a thing or two from him nevertheless.
  And Ken Watanabe gives the 2nd best performance in the movie with entertaining lines like ""let them fight!."" The plot of Aaron Taylor Johnson (Kickass) getting reunited with his family during all the chaos has been done in way too many movies. Despite all that though, the movie is a really good time but due to Godzilla. Godzilla 2 needs more him and less humans.",1400198400,6,1192,4.50462962962963
5955833,2,B00EXPOCXY,"Six long decades ago, Godzilla roared and stomped on Japanese screens for the first time.  What began as a haunting and imaginative reaction to nuclear paranoia later transformed into an ongoing, camp-centric series of over-the-top creature features.  The second major bid to launch an American version of the character, directed by Gareth Edwards, is deadly serious and, sadly, a bit of a failure.

Edwards last directed Monsters, an inexpensive romantic drama set around the Mexico-United States border in the aftermath of an alien invasion.  Monsters is a film I love.  With a subtle hand and an emphasis on war-zone atmosphere, it conjures a genuine sense of awe and fear around its amorous protagonists without relying on mega-budget spectacle.  Edwards' intelligence and taste are not absent in their entirety from his Godzilla.  He tries to stage set pieces in such a way as to tease the audience, slowly revealing the scope of the action and the nature of the threat, forcing us to anticipate and savor the climax rather than simply dialing the volume to a punishing eleven and holding steady.  As respectable as this idea is in theory, however, it can also misfire because the many, many minutes in which Godzilla is not destroying metropolises or tearing into enemy dinosaurs must be shaded with potent drama, mystery, and suspense.  There has to be a point to care beyond the promise of the next eruption of computer-generated wizardry.  Alas, Edwards and his team's grip on character development and storytelling is not up to par, resulting in a laxly-paced picture which flirts with downright tedium.

Another notable shortcoming:  this incarnation of Godzilla devotes an extensive amount of time and attention to its human characters, yet none of them emerge as colorful or interesting.  None of them are figures in whom we can invest in any profound way.  We have the generic, pouting American soldier (the by-default protagonist).  Then there is his generic, concerned wife, in the film to be put in danger briefly near the end.  Present, too, is the generic, inscrutable Japanese scientist; he, of course, recites explanatory dialogue when required to move the lumbering plot forward.  An ace cast of fresh faces and prestigious international stars, including Sally Hawkins, Elizabeth Olsen, and Ken Watanabe, is untested.  It is a nightmare to see so many talented people squandered.  Many of them might as well have stayed home and delivered their performance by telephone.  Only Bryan Cranston, as a nuclear physicist transformed by tragedy into an obsessive conspiracy theorist, is given a role to rip into, one involving notes of genuine anger and melancholy, but the part is unfortunately brief.",1400198400,11,2718,5.162100456621005
5955834,1,B00EXPOCXY,"My review has spoilers, so you have been warned!

I just saw the movie and it put me to sleep. The movie is very slow and tries every way possible to make the movie really about Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his family.  That is, 90% of the movie is just about Ford, and the another 5% is anything else that support Ford's 90% of the story, and the last 5% is Godzilla. You will see a lot of scene switching from something to something. Most of the time, you will see Ford's face right after something, and I hated every time they did that. Really, do they have to really show his face all the time? Yo, I get! He's the star, and NO I don't love him! Stop showing me his stupid face!

You would think, you would see Godzilla for this movie because his name is in the title, right? Wrong! It's all a lie! You won't see Godzilla until a whole hour has passed. That's 1 hr folks to see the main fake star of the movie. Come on! It's not like he's secret and we shouldn't know about him. We came here specifically to see the monster and I for one wasn't happy to wait that long to see him. Also, it's more like Godzilla did a cameo for this movie, and you will only see him a few seconds at a time. 1 hour wait to see 2 seconds of him. BS!!! Finally, you will never see him longer than 20 seconds at the most and that's only for the final battle.

Let's talk about the Kaiju fights. They sucked! For the most part, you will see Godzilla try to fight a MUTO, but you will see that for just about 5 seconds each time, until the VERY END of the movie, where you see the fight last for 30 seconds. These battles they have are basically, a slap here and there. Sometimes they bite each other, and that's about it. What really strange is that they do not take any real damage. Godzilla or the MUTO will never bleed, get cut, or anything. The only time, you see any actually damage done is when Godzilla does a finisher! Wow, really? So, basically, they can't get hurt until one of them figures out how to do a finisher. It's total BS.

The humans/military do nothing! All they do is talk, talk, and more talk. After that, they come up with a horrible plan that doesn't work. The only person that should listen to is the quietest person in the room, and happens to be the smartest guy in the room as well. Who is that? Well, the Japanese guy of course. All they needed to do is follow his simple advise. ""LET THEM FIGHT!"" That's it. Guess, what happened? They fought! It all worked out just because they fought! Literally, the military guys didn't need to do anything! They didn't need to set nukes, fly jets, or jump out of planes. They could have just sat there and went to bed. Then, they woke up the next morning to find out the same results. Godzilla wins.

What I really hated in the movie is when they made Godzilla and the MUTO keep on staring at Ford.  In other words, Ford finds ways to get the monsters to just notice him all the time. They did this 3 or 4 times during the whole movie. WTF? It's like somehow both the monsters just know this guy was the real star in the movie. He is the only reason why you monsters are even in the movie because without Ford there, you won't get your cameos! The worst idea ever!

Now, what did I like about the movie. I liked the CGI effects and the look of the monsters. Godzilla roar was well done too.  And that's it. Even though I liked Godzilla look that just means he needed to be in the movie way more! He's supposed to be the star. It is named after him, so the focus needed to be on him. So, this movie deserved to be a 1 star movie. If there's a Godzilla 2, I WILL NOT PAY to watch it. I know what to expect now.

So is this Godzilla 2014? Hell no!

This movie should had been called Ford's Life 2014. But, who would want to pay money to watch that? No one.

So, they called it Godzilla. Now, they will make millions because of that. Smart.",1400198400,27,3889,4.116094986807388
5955835,1,B00EXPOCXY,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this film (I saw and own EVERY single Godzilla movie, plus ""Rodan"", ""Gappa"", etc.), but leaving the cinema I was very disappointed. Not as much as 16 years ago, but still a lot... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Amongst the few good things I can say about this film is that this time Godzilla looks almost as he should - he also can use a breathing fire attack and his famous roar is back in action. But on another hand he looks kind of heavy around waist and in some of his parts also soft, as if he was in fact a poorly inflated rubber suit (something that never happened in old movies in which Godzilla WAS in fact a guy in a rubber suit...). Also, instead of atomic fire, Godzilla breaths in this film a kind of burning gas - and it is definitely not the same thing as b@d@ss breathing attack in ""classical"" kaiju films...

Other than this improvement in Godzilla's aspect there is not much good I can say about this film. The WORST thing is that THERE IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GODZILLA!! He appears late in this 123 minutes long movie and then he is shown by glimpses of 5 second - and then we move to something else.

Almost as bad is the fact that the two other kaijus (I am not even certain what their names were and I DON'T CARE) appearing in this film are not really that great and especially they are NOT MATCH for Godzilla - once the monsters get into it, Godzilla dispatches them both rather quickly and easily. Do not expect anything even remotely comparable to awesome, epic fights against King Ghidorah, Gigan, Mechagodzilla, Kumonga or Destoroyah.

As I already said this film lasts 123 minutes and only a very small part shows Godzilla - and virtually everything else is completely forgettable! There is NO humour and in this one aspect this film is even WORSE than this 1998 calamity, in which we had at least some attempts to make some scenes funny. No such thing here. Message to the producers: guys, kaiju films are silly by nature and if you try to make them too serious, you will just make them boring...

This film is also indeed BORING! I completely couldn't relate to anybody, as the main ""hero"" (Lieutenant Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is pale and completely uninteresting. The character of his father (played by Bryan Cranston) was much better and this probably is precisely the reason why he was removed so fast from the film. Ken Watanabe, a very talented actor, is COMPLETELY wasted in this movie, as his character, supposedly a renowned scientist, is totally useless. Even worse is the character of Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn), possibly the less charismatic and palest military commander I saw in any action movie in years...

This film actually is not really about Godzilla - it is about Lieutenant Ford Brody traveling around the world: going to Tokyo, spending some time there, catching a flight to Hawaii, spending some time there, catching another flight to some place in USA, catching a train to San Francisco, not getting there, catching a helicopter flight to somewhere else, catching another plane to San Francisco, hiking through San Francisco, catching a boat from San Francisco and finally catching another helicopter flight to San Francisco... Between all this we have some short glimpses at Godzilla and two other kaijus.

Somewhere in the second half of this film I really wanted to have a conversation with Lieutenant Ford Brody. I think it would have gone something like that:

""Lieutenant, are you a giant monster?""

""Sir, no sir""

""Lieutenant, can you breath atomic fire?""

""Sir, no sir""

""Lieutenant, can you roar?""

""Sir, no sir""

""Lieutenant, do you at least have a scaly reptilian tail?""

""Sir, no, I am afraid I don't have one""

""Then lieutenant, here is $3.55 for services already rendered, take them, then be a sweetie, go eff yourself and LET US WATCH A DARN GODZILLA MOVIE!""

That was somewhere around 1 hour 30 minutes into the film. 15 minutes later I didn't bother any more about any kind of conversations - I just wanted something big and unpleasant to step on this guy, so we can finally WATCH A DARN GODZILLA MOVIE!

We certainly see a lot of US Army in this film and by moments it really looks like a recruiting ad. But if you think you will see a grandiose battle against Godzilla or other kaijus, like in old Godzilla movies (the ones in which we see lot of plastic models burning...), you will be very disappointed... There is some limited shooting, but most of it involves M4 assault rifles...))) I am not kidding, there is hardly any other weaponry used in anger. Some missiles are shot and all miss and also a couple of Abrams tanks fire their 120 mm guns, but that latter scene lasts like 3 (three) seconds top...

Soundtrack is so lame it can hardly be noticed that there is any music in this film. Akira Ifukube probably laughed out loud watching this film from his imperial suit in Heaven...

During the great finale, I finally was INFURIATED by the fact that we can see Godzilla only in short sequences and all the rest of the time we watch some @-holes running through the ruins of San Francisco, carrying a huge and TOTALLY USELESS bomb... I also laughed out loud when the terrible threat of kaiju spawns, which was supposed to possibly exterminate humanity, was destroyed with some gas and a match...))) This was however a sad laughter...

I will certainly NOT buy this film on DVD - no way. The one thing me and my daughter are going to do is to watch tomorrow ""Son of Godzilla"", ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" and especially ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"", to try to forget this film... Gosh, what a let-down! Avoid!",1400198400,,5659,4.639

A growing sense of unease.  Shifts of strange silence hanging in the air like a mounting morning fog.
Thunder in the distance.  Rumblings.  Shockwaves.  Explosions once distant draw near.  The ground bucks with booms.

Dread falls on doomed faces like the pall of night.
Death is upon us.

Godzilla is here.

The newest Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters), attempts to regenerate the original 1954 Gojiras sense of dread and disorientation but only has moments of satisfaction doing so early on in the film.  The outstanding trailers make us think that this new Godzilla is by feel almost a horror movie but don't you believe it.  Its more a natural disaster movie, an action movie, a giant monster ecological-lite fantasy movie, and a moderate human drama.  Channeling the measured spirits of Jaws and Alien in mounting tension with partial monstrous reveals works effectively for this movie though Edwards wisely chooses to focus his human protagonists in reflecting stunned awe and fear instead of outright terror as was presented when people faced the shark and the xenomorph.  Edwards gets decent performances from his stars and I appreciated the human drama more than I thought I would and that's a good thing because the monsters get precious little screen time.  Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody who lost his wife to a nuclear accident that turned out to be the result of giant monster activity.  Hes known all along that something great has been amiss, that there has been an enormous cover-up by various governments, and now similar events are happening again.  Joe Brody brings us into the movie and through him we are introduced to his son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who carries the remainder of the movie as he has contact after unfortunate contact with the monsters.  These behemoths (Godzilla and his foes, dubbed MUTOs--a military acronym that stands for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism if I remember correctly) are not the result of man's interference but are biological ancient entities that have awakened.  Godzilla himself is dubbed an ""apex"" predator and, per Japanese scientist Dr. Serizawa (a nod to the original Serizawa from the original ""Gojira"" here played without much passion by Ken Watanabe), the military is advised not to detonate an atomic bomb but to let the monsters duke it out and let Godzilla ""restore nature's balance.""  Only at movie's end do we get to see the big melee between the beasts.

This film holds a couple of surprises, the biggest being that Godzilla is curiously never really seen as a threat.  In fact, fans of the old Showa era Godzilla movies (the first 15, most which had Godzilla occupy a defender of the earth role) may find that this has been the Godzilla movie that they've waited for for over 25 years.  The film manages some nice scenes of destruction and moments of tension but this combined with the surprises don't compensate for the lack of screen time these towering titans deserve.  Speaking of these titans Godzilla keeps very closely in design to his original Japanese counterpart (perhaps most closely resembling an amalgamation of the 1954, 2000, and GMK versions) but most importantly he has the fighting spirit that Godzilla so often possessed in the Japanese movies (none of that wimpy run from the military garbage that we saw in the American 1998 debacle).  The two MUTOs are of a rather uninspired design and difficult to really appreciate.  They are like giant cockroach bugs and borrow from various sources including Edwards' unique aliens from his film ""Monsters"", from the Cloverfield beast, and (strangely enough) from Godzilla 2000's very own Orga.

As a long-time kaiju enthusiast myself who long ago reclaimed his childhood by rediscovering and collecting Godzilla and his kin in movie and other forms I am happy with this newest iteration but I must admit, sadly, that in the end it all felt a bit underwhelming (and I had the benefit of seeing it in IMAX 3D).  Sure the film could never actually live up to my hopes, let alone my expectations, but its a throwback to Saturday matinee fare with fancier SPX.  Its a decent popcorn flick.  And while it might not generate or renew a huge long-term interest in Godzilla it does remind us at least of why we used to find him so enthralling and entertaining.

5955840,4,B00EXPOCXY,"Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards, is the greatest Godzilla movie I've ever watched, and I've watched all of them. The only issues I have with the movie are related to story, acting, and score.

I feel that the score could have been a lot better, even though it was a damn good score. I would have preferred Sam Hulick and Clint Mansell to score the music (even though they probably weren't even considered).

The story had a few plot holes, and places where expanding a plot detail would have been nice or even extending a scene. The characters could have been written a bit better. I think if we got to know the characters a bit more, it'd make it easier to care a lot more about the characters (though I already cared about the characters until the end, but not as much as I could have). Especially Sandra Brody, I feel that if her character was fleshed out a bit more, her death (c'mon let's not act surprised) would have had me in tears, instead I'm just a bit upset that she died.

The acting wasn't bad at all, but it could have been better in certain places.",1400112000,5,1069,4.36180904522613
5955841,5,B00EXPOCXY,"You need to see the Gareth Edwards directed version of ""Godzilla"" not only on the big screen but in IMAX. It is absolutely mandatory to enjoy this film to its full extent. Hearing that roar for the first time in an IMAX theater gives you a wave of goosebumps that pulses from your feet to the back of your neck in an instant and leaves you craving destructive monster mayhem in glorious high definition.

The science fiction monster film is absolutely gargantuan in scope. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was able to achieve quite a bit with perspective and making Spider-Man look tiny compared to the utter gigantism of New York City. ""Godzilla"" takes the opposite approach in taking what are giant cities and making the monsters in the film even larger in comparison.

M.U.T.O. is awesome enough, but the ongoing tease leading up to seeing Godzilla in his entirety is extraordinary. You see his torso after the firing of some flares and a glimpse or two of his tail as it slithers behind a building or a brief shot of the spikes on his back seen through clouds of smoke. As M.U.T.O. destroys an airport, you see Godzilla's feet for the first time which take up the entire runway; finally leading to the slow rising shot of his full reveal capping off with the first official ground shaking Godzilla roar of the film.

The performances are remarkably compelling. Bryan Cranston proves once again that he is an absolutely fantastic supporting actor, but it makes you wonder if he'll ever take a larger role in a big budget film. Ken Watanabe is also extraordinary as the one scientist who is essentially the voice behind Godzilla's rampage. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's talent wasn't bothersome in the ""Kick-Ass"" films, but his voice seems extremely nasally amongst all the chaos. More individuals will focus on the fact that Johnson and Olsen will portray brother and sister in next year's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" while portraying lovers in ""Godzilla.""

The giant monster sequences are utterly jaw dropping and awe inspiring. They will satisfy on absolutely every level, but pay attention to how influentially great the sound of the film is as well. Not only is Godzilla's roaring superb, but everything is done big whether it's an explosion or a covert operation. Keep an eye out for the M.U.T.O. scene by the train tracks as it seems to ride the same set of tension tracks established by ""Jurassic Park"" during the velociraptors in the kitchen sequence. The ""Predator""-like clicking done by M.U.T.O. is also fun to hear in theaters.

Gareth Edwards has not just rebooted a franchise here; he's introduced what will hopefully be a terrifyingly destructive franchise that will leave Godzilla fans clamoring for more. Surprisingly intelligent with first-rate acting and exhilarating special effects, ""Godzilla"" is dangerously amazing, humanity endangering, city-destroying perfection.
