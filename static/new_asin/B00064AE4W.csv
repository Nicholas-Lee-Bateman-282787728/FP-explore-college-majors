Even with only two of the three anti-Shizuma drives in his possession, Genya's enormous `Eye of Volgar' seems unstoppable, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Our heroes are continually on the defensive as Big Fire, Shocking Alberto and Ivan along with his Uranus robot pound them mercilessly. Sadly, the Experts of Justice suffer more than a few casualties including major characters introduced in volume one. By the end of the volume even Giant Robo is left battered and in need of major repairs.

The Giant Robo OVA was eight years in the making and continues to leave viewers scratching their heads. Genya's motivation is classic revenge but what does Big Fire have to gain from worldwide destruction? Why would Chief Chujo want to mothball Giant Robo for fear of his nuclear core exploding since the `Eye of Vulgar' seems far more destructive than any nuclear accident? Both English dubbings of `The Day the Earth Stood Still' seem confused as to whether Genya's `Eye of Volger' has already done more damage than the tragedy of Bashtarlle or not. If Genya has already exceeded the previous disaster with only two of the three anti-Shizuma drives why bother with the third. It would seem to be `mission successful' time to go home and gloat. I've seen volume three so I can say that at least in the previous dubbing these questions are not answered. Even the Magnificent Ten seem confused as to what the heck Big Fire is trying to accomplish.

These questions might be more bothersome if Giant Robo weren't such a terrific OVA. Volume two is the most emotional of the three volumes, it also has the highest death toll of major characters. Giant Robo is almost taken out permanently as he tries in vain to face off against the `Eye of Volger' and Daisuka comes to the realization that Robo is more than just his own personal tool of revenge against Big Fire. Volume two fills in a lot of the gaps in volume one as the viewer finally learns the truth behind the `Tragedy of Bashtarlle' and why Genya is so consumed with the anti-Shizuma drives and revenge on the world. We also learn about Daisaku's past and his own burning hatred towards Big Fire.

Giant Robo has never been a big seller and that's a shame because it really is one of the all time great anime. I wish more people could give it a chance particularly now that you can get all three volumes for relatively cheap.",1114387200,4,2451,4.642857142857143
