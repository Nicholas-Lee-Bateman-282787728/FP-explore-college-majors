This did not concern a volcano, but an earthquake brought down a town instantly.  Due to that, one gets a good slice of life at the time because things were practically frozen.  For example, somebody's watch stopped at the exact moment that the area sunk.  The work mentions dead bodies of children and that may upset some.  The work jumps instantly from the quake in the 1690s to the 1950s when researchers began to search the area.  A positive is that the divers not only brought up colonial artifacts, but also items from the Arawaks.

There is something I hate here, as an Afrocentrist.  The program interviews a Black, Jamaican man near the end.  The work mentions African slaves once.  However, all the other interviewees and all the pirates and governors here were white.  I think Jamaica has been a majority-Black island for centuries, but you wouldn't know that from this work.  This is similar to how ""Cold Mountain"" practically erases Black slaves and has a cast of white blonds.  To be fair, Black slaves weren't the decision makers of Jamaica in the 1600s.  Still, the monochrome nature of this documentary irks me a bit.",1375401600,,1396,4.75
