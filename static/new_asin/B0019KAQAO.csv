8274345,3,B0019KAQAO,"I also used Ancient Mysteries: Reincarnation as a background tool for a Bible Study I taught on Heaven. I was hoping to use this video to stimulate a discussion on reincarnation as it applied to other faith's beliefs/practices regarding the after life, heaven, salvation, etc. What was presented was informative but focused on Tibetan Buddhism. I was hoping for a discussion on the Hindu concept of reincarnation for comparison. As usual, it was a beautiful A&E presentation, though.",1464307200,,483,5.205128205128205

8274351,4,B0019KAQAO,"This relatively short film looks at the philosophy behind the idea of reincarnation while also exploring famous cases of those supposedly reincarnated, such as the Dalai Lama.
