8005217,3,B00011HJ8O,"The DVD gives a good impression of several empty hand and kobudo kata as teached by the late Odo Sensei, who was a famous okinawan karate master. Odo sensei doesn't perform the kata at full speed and force, but in a very relaxed way, just to show the sequence of movements. However, the group of karateka in the dojo perform very poorly, which at times is really hilarious. That is regrettable and does not honor this respectable Sensei. For those interested in the Okinawan kempo system this is an interesting DVD.",1319241600,,515,4.670329670329671
8005218,5,B00011HJ8O,A historical treat for anyone who fallows the late Grandmaster. The video is good quality and very interesting. Odo Sensei was one of the last true karate Masters.,1314316800,,163,4.857142857142857
8005219,1,B00011HJ8O,"Don't waste your money.  This DVD should have never been made.  It should have remained a personal treasure for whoever made the tape.  Odo Sensei was not in his prime and the angles are poor moveover, the other karateka on the DVD, just don't have a clue.  Who trained them????? Save your money and learn karate from a local Sensei near you.",1128470400,,342,4.467741935483871
