2725826,5,B000M6FAUM,"The year was 1929, and everything looked positive. We'd emerged intact from WWI, new products (radios, A/C, refrigerators, washing machines) were being snapped up by consumers, and the availability of credit was further boosting sales.

On Wall Street, speculators were known to be manipulating stocks via pooling, but few cared - they figured that if they lost money this time they'd get it back soon. Reporters aided the scams by being on the take. The Federal Reserve knew the market was too high, but was scared to take action and deflate it. There were several preliminary scares, beaten back each time by easy money for those facing margin calls. Production started sagging - no problem, stocks soared even higher. The peak was reached on Sept. 3, 1929.

Rosy forecasts continued unabated; the few offering negative predictions were scorned. More small scares. Then on 10/29/1929 came the real thing, and nothing could reverse the course. Fabulously wealthy William Durant, founder of G.M. and subsequent major investor, was bankrupted with only $250 in assets (his clothes). Bad as it was, by year end, few realized that the worst was yet to come.",1335312000,,1154,5.068421052631579
2725827,5,B000M6FAUM,"Different 'suits', styles, yet same players & m.o. as 2008 - with identical perilous results. When will we ever learn Sir Isaac Newton's almost 4-century-old Law of Gravitation(1687): what goes up has gotta come down?  So goes the stock market as well ~

This documentary builds up the Crash's cultural context skillfully, using vintage newsreels of gangsters and banksters, popular songs of the day (such as ""I'm in the market for you""), Herbert Hoover's 1928 swearing-in-ceremony, and cartoons & photos showing one popular pastime for both genders: ""watching the ticker"" (tape).

The bad guys of this tale? Unregulated Wall St. bank speculators who formed stealth pools to control movement of any given stock, often playing against the margin (10%) and paying off the press to hype up their favorites (known as ""painting the tape"") to the public.  Its hero: a lone critic (and pariah) named Roger Babson, who ultimately knelled the final bell prior to the Panic. Think Paul Krugman, among others ~

Charlie Chaplin, Groucho Marx, Al Capone, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison, all make fun star turns in this fabulous period piece from PBS American Experience series.  My copy gave tools for classroom usage as well - a wonderful idea, perhaps refreshing our ""market memory"" more frequently in order to avoid another cycle --before we wreck the economy once more ~",1326585600,3,1361,5.0807174887892375
2725828,4,B000M6FAUM,"I really liked this documentary.  I realize that you could easily expand the story of the crash into a 16 hour mini series (wow, what a great idea) and there is only just so much you can cover in a 1 hour TV program.  The real story of the crash of '29 started 30 years before.  This was the culmination of the efforts to establish a central bank in america.",1306195200,2,358,4.085714285714285
2725829,4,B000M6FAUM,"This documentary from public television (WGBH) explains what happened and how the ""other half"" lived prior to the economic crash of 1929.  Relatives of some of America's rich and famous of the 1920s tell their stories through interviews, photos and period film footage.  I bought this video for our school library because our Middle School literature and social studies departments are collaborating on projects about the American economy.  We found it appropriate for that age group although a little more redundancy in identifying the speakers would have been helpful.  Overall, it provides a good explanation of the crash and subsequent Great Depression.",1286150400,2,657,5.411764705882353
2725830,5,B000M6FAUM,"An eye-opening retrospective. This documentary provides a detailed social and political synopsis of the greed and corruption that ultimately produced the Great Depression.  It also makes obvious the parallels between the 1929 and 2008 crashes: (1) the back-room dealings of the uber-wealthy, (2) the unjustified exuberance fueled by the myth of never-ending growth,  (3) the false prosperity based upon debt, (4) the absence of federal regulation, and (5) the complete lack of financial transparency.

Then as now, market manipulations and pseudo-transactions resulted in privatized gains, but socialized losses -- the ultimate corporate welfare where the tax-paying citizen becomes the lender of last resort.  Sadly, the masses continue to embrace the fantasy of their God-given right to become billionaires...  even at the expense of the national well-being. As Justice Louis Brandeis once remarked, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""",1274832000,44,1030,5.535031847133758
2725831,5,B000M6FAUM,Excellent condensed historical overview about events leading up to the stock market crash of 1929.  Provides a very enlightening comparison of today's situation.,1274486400,2,161,6.0
2725832,4,B000M6FAUM,"I saw this when it first came out in 90. This new release is welcome since it has been unavailable for some years. But I wish they had sharpened up the print.  Also it's unfortunate that the trailing credits have been changed from the original. The first one had a nice orgininal rendition of the famous 'Blue Skys' by Jolson as the credits rolled.  This new one ends with some noisy, out of place, modern rock tune.  Why they did this, I don't know.
But nevertheless this is program nicely covers the event,  especially with all the wonderful period news reels of flappers and financiers, bankers and gangsters, great cars and Greatneck mansions.  All the stuff that made the 20's roar. Plus great commentary by descendants of some of these same people. This is a program that could easily  take two hours without losing the attention of the viewing audience. Such is the  richness of the subject and the availability of the material.",1257897600,24,935,4.699386503067485
2725833,4,B000M6FAUM,"I looked up ""Why did the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor?"" online and BOOM! the answer was there immediately.  However, years ago, I google ""Why did the market crash in 1929?"" and didn't get a clear answer.  This documentary helped me to make sense of it, or to revive what little I remember from American history classes.

Teachers may love showing this because it proves the clich'e ""the more things change.""  Our current economic downturn is often spoken of in the same breath as the Great Depression and this doc explains why.  Like in this decade, the 1920s had wreckless businesspeople and lax governmental regulations.  Like now, folk were told to invest in stock that eventually did not pan out.  They showed that some stock buyers would consult an astrologist; this reminded me of the Beanie Baby craze of the 1990s.  This work showed the rich surviving bad things and the poor people getting majorly cheated.

The very last image here is important: it showed people celebrating New Year's 1930.  The point was to say that the depression didn't happen overnight, but ""the party was over.""  Viewers who want to learn about the Great Depression should look elsewhere; this documentary was solely about the champagne days of the 1920s.  It showed how the greed and extravagance of that decade lead to the poverty of the next.  The work says few investors jumped out of windows, as most TV images suggest.

This work may have relied on old footage, because doing the math makes me think that many of those interviewed could not possibly be alive in 2009.  One interviewee made it hard to focus.  He was recorded at a record store and I couldn't shake that Melissa Ethridge and Tracy Chapman LP's were displayed behind him.

This was a strong work that answered many questions for me.  I think it would be highly informative to students.  Perhaps young viewers could also watch the program with their grandparents and have some cross-generational dialoguing.",1255564800,24,1957,4.858006042296073
2725834,5,B000M6FAUM,this presentation was in the first year of American Experience and I cannot find a copy anywhere. It is wonderful for American history classes as it is the clearest explanation ever for the fundamentals behind the crash of the stock market in October of 1929. High school students loved it for the background information about the 1920s and the explanations of the manipulations of the market by traders triggering the regulations of the 1930's. I wish I could find a copy as mine disintegrated after repeated showings.,1234051200,,519,4.977011494252873
2725838,4,B000M6FAUM,"The Crash Of 1929 affected the entire world, eventually leading to the rise of totalitarianism and World War II.  The cause was buying on margin, i.e. 10% down on a share and insider trading which was bound for disaster.  This DVD traces just how this disaster happened.  Well worth having!!!",1448582400,4,292,4.8

2725844,2,B000M6FAUM,"Five stars for content, subtracting three stars for two absolute crimes:

1.  It should be all but illegal to release a DVD in this day and age without closed captioning.  Earth to PBS- Deaf people are people too.  I have students who are hard of hearing and can't show this film in class on the projector because of the lack of closed-captioning.

2.  This DVD HAS A CLOSED CAPTIONING SYMBOL ON IT- so it's ADVERTISED as including Closed Captioning, but it's not actually available.  Just dishonest and outrageous.",1417392000,,515,4.784090909090909

2725846,5,B000M6FAUM,"They say, it takes 30 years for the society to produce a considerable number of new suckers who will believe in the illusion of wealth with no work who can impact the economy considerably. Stock Market of 1929 was a good example for two of the greatest emotions of fear and greed, panic on upside and panic on downside. US experienced those emotions once again in 2008 but in real estate and how funny, both times Republican presidents were in charge. Wonder if fear and greed will get to repeat itself before 2017.

2725849,5,B000M6FAUM,This is a very good documentary about the people that were behind the crash. It is something that should be seen because that situation is one that can and will repeat itself.,1405296000,,175,4.5

2725851,5,B000M6FAUM,"This documentary should be required watching for every American. It illustrates how greed can undermine all that is good in society.

2725853,4,B000M6FAUM,"The hit song of 1929 went: ""Nothing but blue skies do I see..."" and that sums up the spirit of the times. That was the lead-up to the stock market crash of 1929.

The DVD focuses on the year 1929 and some of the men who were leaders in the securities field such as William Durant, founder of GM, Charles Mitchell, the man who popularized stock ownership for the ""little guy"" and Jesse Livermore, a veteran Wall Street technician.

The DVD does a good job of relating the spirit of the times and the optimistic attitude of Americans during the ""Roaring 20's"" when Americans came to believe in permanent prosperity. It seemed everyone expected to be able to ""strike it rich"" and the Stock Market was only one of the disasters in the 20's - the other being the Florida real estate bubble.

There is the usual recounting of the issues involved: easy credit, buying on margin, valuations that had nothing to do with the actual profitability of companies, the rigged game played by the big money interests. What surprised this viewer the most is that everyone knew it was - at least to some extent - a rigged game that the ""little guy"" really couldn't win! And yet, they kept coming back for more! It seemed that everyone was seeking a way to ""get rich quick"" and, even though they knew the market was a racket, they kept hoping for that one big score!

I think the video did a good job of relating the attitudes of the day, spotlighting some of Wall Street's leading speculators, and giving a good recounting of the events that led up to ""Black Thursday"" and the following days that were ""The Crash"". I don't think it did as good a job of linking the crash to the acceptance by Americans of easy credit and indebtedness or events in Europe that actually precipitated the crash and following depression.

In conclusion, I think this DVD does a good job of presenting the events that led up to the crash as well as the crash itself. I recommend this DVD with four stars.",1375660800,14,1963,4.487394957983193
2725854,4,B000M6FAUM,This documentary captures the mood of the country in 1929 and how everybody assumed stocks could be forced up forever.  The practice of buying on margin and having to put in more cash to keep your shares seemed especially fatal.  A few of the major bankers are described in their out of touch arrogance and descendants are interviewed.  I wish there had been more personal accounts of how life changed immediately after the crash.,1367193600,2,430,4.783783783783784

8166782,5,B000M6FAUM,"Made in 1990 (too bad it did not prevent the 2008 Financial Crisis) this begins with New Year's Day 1929 sharing that the new techon9ology of the day made everybody optimistic of the future including the song 'Blue Skies' The new President Hoover takes office in March and things go well. When there is a point of trouble a man steps in and is able to quell the fears. With interviews and vintage images this shares the pending doom which included a believed astrologist who felt thing were fine, then it all goes to pieces. Insightful, sad, and frustrating that so many could be duped by the system. Explains that there is a cycle of years of forgetting that causes crashes to occur, mentions a panic in 1907.

8166786,5,B000M6FAUM,"The good times and vibrant feeling of the ""Roaring Twenties"" were about to change, dramatically. Several wealthy men had invested heavily into the stock market and became even richer. The feeling and thinking for the ""ordinary man"" seeking instant wealth and riches if only he played in the stock market caught on. But, in order to get rich, you had to invest money. Money, most did not have to gamble or play with to make more money. So, with that intent, banks began a little thing known as ""credit."" Buy now and pay later became a real motto and soon, a good majority of hard working citizens were in deep with debt. The banks and creditors became nervous as payments were not coming in as expected. Interest rates skyrocketed to 20 percent or close to it. Citizens could not pay as normal. The Stock market was not paying off as many expected. So, speculators trading commodities, etc. got nervous as well. Soon, it seemed much of what was thought to be real worth was that of ""credit"" and debt owed by thousands of citizens that couldn't pay back. A few of the ultra rich, then, invested millions into the market to avoid a virtual crash right then and there, but it was diverted or slowed for a time. Eventually, the borrowing had caught up and on a Tuesday in late 1929, the stock market did indeed crash sending stocks tumbling and virtually worthless, much, much less than what they were worth days prior.
The ""Crash"" would have lasting effects on millions of US Citizens, nationwide. For those living in what was known as ""The Dust Bowl"" of the central states and plains, it would prove ""catastrophic"" taking lives of men, women and children. The lasting effects of the Great Depression of the 1930s would soon end however, and things would get eventually back to normal. The USA would never forget the Great Depression of the '30s.",1485993600,2,1842,4.653374233128834
