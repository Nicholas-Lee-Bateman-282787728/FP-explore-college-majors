8304142,5,B001G6SQWG,"I purchased this video to use in a Sports Literature class at the high school level to illustrate teamwork in a sport that might seem more of a solo-activity. The students--non-climbers--and I were blown away by the level of climbing on display. The exotic locations give the video a higher level of interest than some of the competing videos I've seen (the China footage had a fun edge to it as well), and the inclusion of Beth Rodden, who climbs at a level most male climbers can only dream of, was an excellent decision. The senior boys were very impressed that a girl with such a girlish voice was doing something most of them would never dare in a million years.",1291334400,5,667,4.520661157024794
8304143,1,B001G6SQWG,"The first couple episodes (or ""doses"") are kind of boring. They are ok for a once-through. Watching Beth Rodden on Meltdown (5.14) was amazing though!

In one of the episodes, the base of a climb had flooded with water after a storm. Rather than wait for the flooding to naturally subside the climbers went and got a shovel and dug a big drainage trench. I was appalled to see this! And that they shot video of it and included it to make it seem ok to other climbers!! Now before you go off thinking I'm some kind of tree hugging eco-hippy. Stop. I'm not. I'm a climber. I am interested in climbing. I'm a proud Access Fund member too. Here is the issue: Climbing is a dangerous sport. Private land owners and even National and State parks/forestry services are *very* leery about letting us climb on their land. All it takes is for one person to get hurt and sue the pants off the landowner for access to get shut down. Also, land owners (*especially* public/government ones) routinely review their ""use"" policies to decide whether or not to allow certain recreational activities to continue. If us climbers leave trash, disturb sensitive wildlife, disregard posted closings, or tear up the land, we risk being shut out of the places we love. It has been happening all over the country. The current solution is to have climbers pool their money together and just buy up the properties or just give up on them. This is insane. We can't buy up every crag. We need to be role models to keep our access to what we love. We need to practice leave-no-trace ethics. We need to always do it better than the next guy when it comes to taking care of our crags. Or we lose them. This is what disappointed me in Dosage 5. You would think they would know better. Don't think it can't happen to us. ATV riders are being run out of just about every park now because of careless ""stuntaz"" tearing up the land. We need to do better.",1288569600,6,1916,4.4586894586894585
