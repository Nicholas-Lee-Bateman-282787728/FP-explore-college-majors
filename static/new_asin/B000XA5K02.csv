2999524,5,B000XA5K02,"My two and a half year old sits mesmerised at Charlie & Lola, he asks for it continuously and has even started to speak with an english accent which I am sure won't last!  One thing worth mentioning is that even with it on in the background, for some unusual reason, none of it begins to be annoying to adults and it can be left on in a loop safely without fear of danger to parent's sanity.

He took it into his day-care and displayed it proudly to the other kids of similar ages (My 11 year old sits equally transfixed at this DVD and at the younger one's attention span!) and the staff there reported similar interest with all the kids there.",1242604800,,645,4.235772357723577
2999525,5,B000XA5K02,"All things Charlie and Lola are great.  My parents used to call television 'bubble gum for the brain' and limited my watching of tv.  I still believe this too, but Charlie and Lola is to my 2 1/2 year old what Sesame Street was to me.

She adores Charlie, Lola, Marv, Morten, Lotta, Soren Lorensen and Sizzles as well. The videos are her after dinner treat.  They help her with her language skills, and I think she is even developing a bit of an english accent.

We also watch them in the car...She loves taking a ride, because she knows she gets to watch Charlie and 'Ola' as she says.

Try one video, you have nothing to loose, and soon enough you will have a whole collection of them.",1219881600,,687,4.286821705426356
2999526,5,B000XA5K02,"C & L are my 4 year old daughter's favorite, and the fact that each episode is 12 minutes long means I can control time in front of the dvd very well.  No needing 1.5 hours to complete a story line, but still some character development and continuity between stories to keep her commited to these particular characters.  And, seriously more interesting for me to watch with her than almost all alternatives for her age.",1212192000,,419,4.573333333333333
2999527,4,B000XA5K02,"Cute story about Charlie and his little sister, Lola. Probably more amusing to those already familiar with this series and/or new TV series. This story about a playdate with a shy boy will appeal to parents who want to provide an offbeat story about getting along with those who are slow to warm up.",1207526400,,299,4.555555555555555
2999528,5,B000XA5K02,"Both my youngest children ages 3 and 21 months absolutely LOVE this show.  My three year old even talks like Lola now. And she loves to dress in clothes that look like something Lola would wear.  I love the fact that it appeals to a wide range of ages.  Even my 11 year old and her friends will watch it with the younger children sometimes.  It's not like those annoying loud cartoons they play on TV these days.  Charlie & Lola portrays a couple of average (funny) kids in normal every day situations with no violence, name calling or other bad behavior. Finally! A cartoon I don't mind my kids watching in the evenings at ""settle down time"".",1207267200,,643,4.415254237288136
2999529,5,B000XA5K02,"I love the Charlie & Lola dvd's for the single fact that my 3 year old son and 1 year old daughter can watch them together. They aren't too girly or too boyish like most of the animated cartoons/movies out there. I also like that the dvd is not a movie. It's a series of 7 or so episodes. I like this because I and they don't feel obligated to watch a full feature film. More time for them to play outside!!! The lessons taught are what we go thru at home and I like that it reinforces what we teach: sharing, cleaning your room, etc.",1204156800,,534,4.047169811320755
2999530,4,B000XA5K02,"""This is Actually My Party"" is the seventh DVD release in the line of ""Charlie and Lola"" DVDs. Like the others, it contains seven fun stories from the show. It also features promos for other DVD releases and two great bonus features -- ""Dancing Dogs"" music video (hilarious and fun) and goof outtakes featuring the animated characters.

The title story is ""This is Actually My Party."" In this one, Charlie is having his birthday party. He has a very specific idea for what he wants out of his party -- a monster party, featuring a cake with green icing, monster games, and monster music. Lola, on the other hand, thinks that this is not a good idea for the party. She tries to replace it with her own idea of the perfect party, not realizing that it's Charlie's party and should generally be what he wants. (Oh, this is one of several stories from the show that has been made into a book as well.)

Six other stories are featured on this DVD - ""My Best Best Bestest Friend,"" ""What if I Get Lost in the Middle of Nowhere?,"" ""I Just Love My Shiny Red Shoes,"" ""Lucky Lucky Me,"" ""Will You Please Stop Messing About"" and ""Look After Your Planet."" Each of them are good in their own way. ""Look After Your Planet"" may be the most fun, though, because it features Morten, Marv's fun and funny little brother who was just recently introduced to the series.

Another essential DVD release for the series. Seeing as it appears we're not getting any sort of season set release, hopefully they'll just keep putting these out so all the episodes will be available on DVD.",1203206400,9,1557,4.4946996466431095
