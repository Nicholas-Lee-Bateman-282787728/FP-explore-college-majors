1882385,1,B00009AV9T,"I bought this as a complement to my kid's school work on WWII and I should not have wasted the money. This is a terrible dvd series which is incredibly dated. It has not been digitalized, the images are those of a fuzzy series from the 70's, the voice over is not narrated like contemporary documentaries but read in the staccatto style of the Murrow's boys. It is difficult to understand and the images uninteresting. Don't bother.",1239580800,,432,4.623376623376624
1882386,5,B00009AV9T,Walter Cronkite was a war correspondent on the front lines of World War.  Therefore he knows what he is talking about because he was there!,1216339200,,139,4.56
1882387,5,B00009AV9T,"What makes a good WWII retro-spect is the narration and information. Walter Cronkite has all of that PLUS he was there. He went in with the troops in Market Garden. Plus there is a lot footage you probably haven't seen.

Also a lot of time you see 3-disk set with makes it sound like lot of minutes. This 3-disk set delivers many hours",1183161600,2,335,4.317460317460317
1882388,1,B00009AV9T,"buyer beware,i purchased this series from crazyape at a great price.the only problem,is that, what i received was not the title that is advertised.seller and amazon were notified ,but it's still advertised as the walter cronkite series.unprofessional and deceptive company.",1176940800,,273,5.85
1882389,5,B00009AV9T,How on earth can this DVD be anything but wonderful( if you can call war that)when Walter Cronkite is involved with it???  I don't care if he was talking about grass growing or sand in the desert I would still listen... Its World War II and he describes it completly . I dare say he made it informational and entertaining at the same time. Enjoy! I did!,1176940800,7,353,4.268656716417911
1882390,5,B00009AV9T,"I am a fan of most WWII documentaries.  I had not seen most of the segments in this set with the late Walter Cronkite.  It has some great seldom told stories from an American Newsman's Perspective who served in World War II. It contains stories about Leningrad, Stalingrad, Finland, Malta, North Africa, The Air War over Germany, the north atlantic convoys, The German V1, V2, rocket program, War Crimes trials and many others.  I find it to be an excellent supplement to the World at War box set.  A true enthusiast will not find this set disappointing. It is over 14 hours in length. Most volumes consist of stories that are about 20-30 minutes in length.  They are pieced together well and add some depth to the picture of WWII that is portrayed so often on the History channel.  It is a five star set in its content and quality but does not have the international perspectives or comprehensive view of the war that the World at War has.  It also does not have the detailed military analysis that the Battlefield Series has. Still, this set is good and a history buff will enjoy the numerous first hand accounts of events that are recorded in the series. For the Price, it is well worth it. May we learn from history and not repeat it.",1099958400,18,1238,4.5
7990388,5,B00009AV9T,"Very well put together.  I have other WWII videos, but this is my favorite.  Cronkite does a fabulous job!",1408320000,,106,4.526315789473684
7990389,5,B00009AV9T,"This is classic Walter Cronkite, a voice we need today in the news. Mr cronkite presents the information in an unbias manner. This should be in every History teacher's library.",1398038400,,176,4.9
7990390,5,B00009AV9T,"Great documentary covers many aspects of the war in North Africa, the Mediteranean, Western Europe and Eastern Europe.
This documentary not only tells the general history, and major events and operations of the war, but also it tells several important key events that happened such as the polish uprising, and the bombing raids on Ploesti, and and the Russo-Finnish war
Overall a Great documentary that goes into great depth and detail of World War Two.",1362528000,,453,5.053333333333334
7990391,5,B00009AV9T,I loved these stories on vhs and now have them on DVD. A great collection narrated by a great news voice.,1361318400,,105,4.0476190476190474
7990392,5,B00009AV9T,"My Dad has this series on VHS, and I enjoyed watching it with him, learning about the history of WWII through the eyes of Walter Cronkite.  Having it on DVD now insures that I can pass the history along!",1356393600,2,203,4.205128205128205
7990393,5,B00009AV9T,"This older TV series, hosted by the late Walter Cronkite, is an excellent way to find out what WWII in Europe was all about and shows much of what happened.  It was a different time, when mostly the young were drafted into service to fight against an evil that, at that time, threatened  the world.  It literally changed that world.  The series is a good 'jumping off place' not only for any one who wants to go on to study the War in greater depth but also an excellent source for family study and perhaps remembrance.  WWII is the reason we got a GI Bill  and underlines why it was so well deserved.",1354665600,3,601,4.274336283185841
7990394,5,B00009AV9T,"I have watched this entire series, and its' sister series ""The CBS News War in the Pacific, with Walter Cronkite"" many times. The much more acclaimed ""The World at War"" from the BBC gets more acclaim and attention, but this series is just as good, if not better. The twist is, .... both series stress their country's role in the war, and leave out much of what the other country did.

As far as a prelude to war and the explaining of the causes of the War ... the CBS series wins .. .hands down. The World at War series gets into Germany's rise from the ashes after WW 1, into Hitler's ascent into power, and then into The German invasion of Poland in the first episode. The CBS series has a tremendously impressive story built into it about Japan's role in the prelude to war by it's invasion of Manchuria, and then mainland China, before Germany even comes into the picture. It's amazing to see the Chinese as tremendously grateful for the American role in their battle against the Japanese in the 1930's.

The rise of Hitler from a nut-case anarchist into Chancellor, and then ultimately dictator of Germany is well chronicled. It's fascinating to see the development of Hitler from a crack-pot soap box orator into what many Germans almost perceived to be a ""god"".

Many of Hitler's henchmen are subjects of their own episode (Goerring, Goebbels, Hess), unfortunately not Himmler). Those Germans who repeatedly tried to kill Hitler are also profiled (Count Claus von Staufenburg, etc.) There is great coverage as well as the horrific ""trial"" of these ""conspirators"". I had never seen some of the footage of these trials, the defendants and the absolutely whacko judge who, ironically and justly enough, was killed in own courtroom trying some of the last of these ""traitors"" from the failed July 20, 1944 assassination attempt on the Fuhrer in March of 1945.

His courtroom was hit and he was killed, by a a bomb perhaps guided there by God Himself. Who knows? But the judge was clearly over-the top nuts and deserved ""justice"".  The video has some fascinating lectures by him depicted as he berates those he branded ""traitors"", who were acting , in the main, in their firm belief that they were trying to save Germany from a madman (Hitler).

As for most military action, there is definitely an American emphasis, just as ""The World at War"", clearly emphasized the British military.

All in all, put both together...and a GREAT learning experience is in store for you. If I had to chose just one, I would go with this one, but ""the World at War"" is also just too good to pass up. You should check them both out. I'm sure you will be immensely informed, entertained and enlightened.",1342656000,4,2686,4.690021231422505

7990397,5,B00009AV9T,"WALTER CRONKITE's World War 11 - War in Europe and Pacific dvd sets are based on the stories from his TV show, THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. It was one of my favourite programs to watch on a Sunday afternoon back in the early 1960's.

I plan to buy this set, but I need information regarding the run time length of one episode that I am greatly interested in and which I have never seen.

On Disc 3 called, WARS WITHIN A WAR, there is a story called, GET THE GRAF SPEE.
About the German pocketbattleship GRAF SPEE - her raider career, naval battle with 3 British cruisers off Uruguay and eventual scuttling outside Montevideo harbour in December 1939.

Can anyone, who has seen this particular episode, tell me if this is the full story on the Graf Spee, run time at 25 minutes in length or just a short, condensed version of about a minute as shown on the program listing?

Thank you.",1256688000,,878,4.401234567901234
