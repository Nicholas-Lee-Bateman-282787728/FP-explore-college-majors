The story begins with a man riding hard while four others are shooting at him. Another horseman rides by, the pursuers shoot at him! But he hides in the rocks. The first rider find him and suggests a trade of horses. But something goes wrong for him! Later Lucky hides the heavy saddlebags when he sees a wagon broken down, and then helps with the wheel. Lucky meets Ann Thornton. Then he shows his skills with a .22 rifle. Those four riders show up looking for Jim Thornton; they took over his mine. That mine is all Ann Thornton owns. Doc Haliday talks about his cure-all medicine in town. Lucky Thompson shows his skills with firearms. [Did OSHA approve this act?] People buy the bottles to cure their ailments. [Subtle humor here.] The sheriff arrests Lucky for the murder of Jim Thornton! ""He's wearing Jim's hat."" ""Think nothing of it"" says his cellmate.

The coroner says the body shows no evidence of foul play. The only lawyer in the county? Lucky tells what happened. [More subtle humor in the courtroom.] Ann's ownership of the Bonanza mine is recognized in court, the death was an accident. Lucky was advised to get away. Lucky retrieves the bag of gold dust, but is pursued by those four men. Jim's diary tells what happened. The sheriff tells Lucky he is free, but should stay at the mine to help Ann. The four men search for Lucky, Ann rides to find the sheriff and tell him that Bat and his men are trying to take over the mine. Those men catch Lucky, and want to make it look like an accident. Lucky rides after them and shows his riding skills in stopping them. The sheriff's men catch up to Lucky, just in time. Ann finds gold in the extractor machine. Lucky isn't a bit surprised.

""Hoot"" Gibson seems to be having fun in this drama about saving an inheritance for an orphaned young woman. The cowboy as an instrument of justice was a recurrent theme in these Westerns.",1282521600,2,1914,4.510086455331412
