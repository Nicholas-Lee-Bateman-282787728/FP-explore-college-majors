4105545,5,B003BEDAVS,"There is not one false moment in this movie.  Every frame, every actor, every word is perfect.  Precious had been serially raped by her father.  We meet her as an obese sixteen year old who is smart but hides it well.  After finally moving out of her mother's house, she becomes determined to mother her children and make something of her life.  You won't see dramatic changes, but rather shifts in Precious' attitude that will enable her to develop.  We don't ever discover her abilities, but we know she will break the cycle of abuse into which she was born.  This is an excruciatingly painful movie to watch, but it's message is important.  No matter how beaten anyone is, with determination, we can get help,  own our own lives, and develop into the people we were meant to become.  Well done.",1259020800,3,797,4.588652482269503
4105546,5,B003BEDAVS,"Perhaps ""thought provoking"" isn't the right phrase to use. This movie will whip you about and leave you breathless, most especially if you've never really considered the plight of children/people like Precious.

I have been teaching adult students for a little over ten years now, and I have had many women whose backgrounds were similar to Precious' background, so the subject matter wasn't new to me. I expected to be moved, but I didn't expect to have to struggle to stop crying after the movie was over.

The movie is about a teenager named Precious (a truly ironic name, as she is told and shown repeatedly that she is NOT precious to anyone in her immediate circle) and the horrific circumstances of her life at the age of 16.  She is pregnant with her second child, the product of incest (her ""father"" rapes her, a fact which her mother chooses instead to see as Precious threatening her by taking away her man and giving him more babies than he ever allowed the mom to have), and she is barely holding together some semblance of a normal life by keeping her true circumstances from everyone around her.

When her school principal becomes aware of her pregnancy, she decides to send Precious to an alternative school, and for the first time, the teenager has an opportunity to see her own potential and to have that potential respected by others. It's a truly life-altering opportunity, and Precious takes it.

What's really amazing in this film is the excellence of the acting. You've likely heard time and time again how Mariah Carey doesn't wear makeup and looks haggard and old, and you've probably heard about Monique's superb turn as Precious' mother. What can't be conveyed without you actually watching the movie is what all that means. To me, it meant witnessing moments when an actor found ways to manipulate his/her body language and expressions to create a character in one movement. Precious, for example, is both a burdened, pitiful human being whose scrunched-up face and blank expression tell the audience that she is very nearly spiritually dead. Then, in an instant, she begins to daydream, and her body, her expression, her entire carriage is transformed. She radiates happiness and sensuality, a sense of being totally alive and joy-filled. It's more than the clothing and makeup. It's everything that shows up on her face, in the way she moves, in the lifting of her brow so that she no longer looks closed off to life. Incredible.

Monique is also excellent, from the bland expression of a couch potato who is frozen before the tube to the rage of a woman who feels betrayed by the very daughter she has betrayed so often. Awesome. There is a scene where she is trying to convince someone that she loves Precious, and she earnestly tries to prove that she has strongly positive and loving memories of her daughter, only to find that she can't even get the dates in the memory right, that she can't get something as important as a milestone date right. The expression on her face as she realizes both the depths of her own abandonment of her daughter and the fact that others can see through her I'm-a-great-mom facade--excellent.

There are many uncomfortable moments in this movie, moments that made my fellow audience members laugh but which truly were heartbreaking. In the midst of horrible abuse, a tiny glimmer of something funny--so tough to take, but also evidence of how life is rarely simply one thing or another.

Precious' life will blow you away if you've never met or known anyone like her. It will sadden you, and hopefully it will enrage you enough to do more for people like her. I know that it made me think about the strong women I've taught who pulled themselves out of situations like the one depicted in the movie, and it made me more determined to really get to know my students so that someone like Precious will not slip through the cracks when I can possibly help.

See this movie because the acting is so superb.  Remember it because its imagery is powerful and real. And hopefully, never forget that there are many, many women and children out there who have had lives like Precious'.",1259020800,193,4141,4.738888888888889
4105547,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious Jones (Gaboure Sidibe) is an overweight black girl from Harlem who's life is a living hell. She lives with a hateful, abusive mother (Monique) who is constantly telling her how stupid and ugly she is. After becoming preganant with her second child, Precious is sent to an alternative school. Her new teacher (Paula Patton) recognizes her potential and starts to give her the love and attention she so desperately needs. Gradually Precious starts to gain self-confidence and take the necessary steps to improve her life.

This is the type of movie that a mediocre director could have turned into a cliched melodrama. But Lee Daniels instead creates a near masterpiece. The artsy dream sequences that feature Precious' rich fantasy life are nice. But it is really the intense moments of drama, especially between Precious and her mother, that pack an emotional wallop. Gaboure Sidibe and Monique provide two of the best acting performances of the year. Also excellent are the classroom scenes, as Precious and the other girls work towards giving up their hard bitten ways and being able to trust each other. Paula Patton is also outstanding as the teacher who gives them hope. I won't give away all the ""unrelenting circumstances"" faced by Precious. But even the most cynical will be left cheering in the end. This one of the best movies of the last several years and receives my highest recommendation.",1258761600,2,1410,5.0
4105548,5,B003BEDAVS,"Based upon the 1996 novel ""Push"" by Saffire, the movie ""Precious"" tells a visceral story of finding purpose and meaning in the harshest of circumstances.  Directed by Lee Daniels, ""Precious"" is a low-budget movie which won recognition at several independent film festivals. The film secured strong commercial backing and is on the verge of a greatly deserved success.

The story is set in 1987 in Harlem and it features a morbidly overweight, illiterate 16-year old girl, Clareece ""Precious' Jones.  Precious has been raped by her father and as the movie opens is pregnant for the second time with her father's child.  Precious lives in a small, decrepit apartment with her abusive mother, Mary, who is on welfare. Mary abuses her daughter verbally and physically and treats her as a person of no worth or account in life.  Precious becomes wrapped up in herself and retreats to a rich fantasy world.  During scenes of abuse, Precious visualizes herself as an actress, thin and on the arm of a young light-skinned black man.

Precious comes to a sense of herself during the course of this frequently disturbing movie.  Under the tutelage of a young teacher in an alternative school, Precious gradually learns to read and write and begins to keep a journal. She slowly learns to write and to be able to verbalize and confront her situation.  Precious also works with a young no-frills social worker who also helps her towards self-understanding and self-respect.

In her film debut, Gaboure Sidibe portrays Precious with the maturity and passion of a gifted, seasoned actress. Monique plays the tormented Mary, Precious's mother.  In roles that could have become stereotypical, Paula Patton plays Precious' teacher,  Ms. Blue, Mariah Carey plays the social worker, Ms. Weiss, and Lenny Kravitz offers support to Precious in his role as a male nurse.  The brutally cruel back streets of Harlem, and the fetid apartment of Precious and her mother set the scene for the movie.

This is a tough, vulgar, and raw movie which works towards moments of insight. Through language that is crude througout and through scenes of violence and despair, ""Precious"" offers a vision of the power of endurance, kindness, love, and creativity to redeem even the seemingly most hopeless and desperate situations.

4105549,4,B003BEDAVS,"As PRECIOUS opens, Claireece ""Precious"" Jones, a morbidly obese 16-year-old product of incest, is living a life of misery, hopelessness, and invisibility. Her schoolmates laugh at her, boys on the street abuse her, and her bitter mother tells her she is worthless. Her public school teachers in Harlem have never even looked closely enough to realize that she cannot read or write.

Pregnant via rape for a second time, she is kicked out of her junior high school and enrolled in a special class for wayward teen girls. It is there, through the kindness of her teacher (Paula Patton, the pretty co-star of ""Hitch"") and classmates, that she begins to blossom as a self-directed human being. Despite this message of human potential and a few lighter moments here and there, the movie remains pretty grim. In this, it sticks fairly close to the novel it is based on,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Push/dp/3499226979/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Push</a>&nbsp;by Sapphire, who I understand had a part in the casting and other aspects of the filming.

The acting is superb throughout. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe is amazing in the lead role of Precious. Also impressive is capturing the complex emotions of the abusive mother is Mo'Nique. And Mariah Carey is quite good in the role of a Jewish welfare worker (complete with a Brooklyn accent).

Andrew Dunn's cinematography is also a highlight. Among the film's strongest visual elements are the depictions of Precious's near-psychotic dissociations. During moments of abuse or confrontation, her drab, gray existence magically transforms into a colorful inner world in which she is a bright star, a handsome, light-skinned man on her arm. And when she looks in the mirror, she sees not her fat, black self but a beautiful, light-skinned glamour girl. Gradually, we see her grow into herself to the point that she can actually face a mirror and see herself.

Although toned down somewhat from the novel, the movie tackles the tough topic of homophobia. Precious's abusive parents are virulently homophobic. But through her positive experiences with a lesbian mentor (in the novel, a lesbian classmate also comes to her aid), she comes to reject her parents' bias. The film also tackles other weighty issues, including abuse, incest, racism, and obesity.

The film's gender messages are somewhat troubling. With the abusive father absent except for a couple of very brief flashback-type images of rape, our outrage is directed at the mother. This makes a target out of a troubled and incompetent woman who under other circumstances could have been drawn more sympathetically.

Ultimately (and I have to be careful here not to be a spoiler), the film's biggest flaw is the unbelievable nature of the redemption story. Indeed, this is a prime example of our culture's near-delusional optimism that Barbara Ehrenreich critiques in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bright-sided-How-the-Relentless-Promotion-of-Positive-Thinking-Has-Undermined-America/dp/0805087494/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bright-sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America</a>. Precious triumphs through sheer willpower to a far greater degree than is likely for a young woman with this many strikes against her. It's the kind of thing that Oprah (an executive producer, along with Tyler Perry) promotes, but it's a bit like winning the million-dollar lottery.

These flaws aside, we are swept along via not only the superb acting and cinematography but, perhaps even more importantly, Lee Daniels' brilliant direction. Daniels realistically portrays the grim despair of Precious's world without ever becoming exploitive. That's a delicate feat, and he pulls it off masterfully.",1258243200,4,3806,5.713780918727915
4105550,4,B003BEDAVS,This movie shows the reality of lives that are affected by incest and where choice seems a fairy tale.  Both of Precious' parents are locked in a life of immorality and illegality and have no way out.  Precious too seems headed down that road but for the intervention of her principal that moves her to an alternative school where she can get individual attention and where her past does not have to swallow her.  Much abusive language but the effect puts the viewer into Precious' life so that you too can experience the threats and put downs.  Not for the faint hearted but more films like this are needed to awake the world to the effects of incest and ridicule. First class acting throughout.  A must see really!  It is ironic that all of the people I know named Precious have had lives that attempted to stunt their development.  What's in a name?,1257638400,40,852,4.529411764705882

When she experiences these assaults or hears information that feels intolerable, she seems to disassociate-- transporting herself to fantasies of unlimited success, magnificent clothes, adoring fans, a gorgeous man kissing the nape of her neck, paparazzi competing for closeups--  this sort of detachment, a defense mechanism, often accompanying victims of ongoing severe trauma.

It is to her credit that she plays the role in such a way that when it is all over you almost feel sorry for her. Gabourey Sidibe plays a very difficult role in a realistic and insightful way. Both Paula Patton and Mariah Carey give excellent supporting performances in important roles. Lennie Kravitz makes a great impression in a short role as a nurse.

4105671,1,B003BEDAVS,"First of all, not based on a true story but a novel. I feel it's sickening how much the author morbidly added to the pains of this character. Sure there are people that were raped, obese, with HIV, with two kids, with horrible mothers, etc but this was just too much. Ok, it was a sum from people she knew (the author), but it was not one person.

Then as always, it's blaming the culture, trying to stay on welfare, if you work hard your dreams come true.

That's not true at all. Not all people want to milk the system. Many work hard are still struggling. it's not just a mentality or a cultural thing. it's a system that doesn't hire people, that doesn't provide them chances. This is never once hinted at in the movie.

It's all their mentality's fault and the ""whites"" all have the right mentality because they're doing well. They must work so hard and educate their children so well while all the other races are lazy except for a few like Precious who push away and try to emulate the ""white"" lifestyle.

This movie is all about the you're poor because you want to argument.

Does anyone in their right mind think someone would want this f--d up life (like the characters of this movie have) because of a welfare check? It's a cycle, that's enabled by our system where a white ex-convict has the same chances of being hired than a black college graduate.

And I'm not even black, but I see this.

I'm a minority too; I went to college, and I'm still struggling. It's not just about oh, you  have to go to college and your dreams will come true.

But sure, we all throw the race card because all we want is a big fat welfare check.",1457136000,,1638,4.309446254071661

I think the film has some problematic aspects, as my students adeptly pointed out: for example: the ""hero"" women in this film are light-skinned; the mother in the film is demonized perhaps without any empathetic qualities, when in reality she is a victim, too; the male perpetrator goes unpunished and without much focus for the responsibility of his acts (mother blame is the focus).

4105810,3,B003BEDAVS,"I don't understand Tyler Perry. I don't get his Madea character or why he chooses to
play more than one character in his films. What is going on? Its gotten so bad that even
if I see his name affiliated with a movie, I approach it with suspicion. This is exactly
what I did with his latest film, Precious, which he produced with Oprah Winfrey.
Precious tells the story of an overweight teen from Harlem who is pregnant with her
second child and is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can
head in a new direction. She is illiterate, desperately poor, and living with a mother so
abusive she makes Mommie Dearest look like Mother Teresa. This film delivers
visually, on story, and with acting.
The cinematography captures the spirit of Harlem and the soul of our protagonist. The
story draws you in with harsh reality tempered with beautifully positioned dream
sequences. The screenplay by Geoffrey Fletcher (based on the book Push by Sapphire,
her first novel after two books of poetry) was subtle and hit several powerful marks.
There are several great performances, such as that of the relatively new face of Paula
Patton (who thus far has played smaller roles in films such as Swing Vote and
Hitch). Then there are outstanding performances by the likes of true newcomer
Gabourey Sidibe (who plays the lead role in this her first film). Also youll find Mariah
Carey giving a fantastic performance.
But none of these performances provide the same depth as MoNiques portrayal of
Precious angry, hateful mother. In every scene, MoNique draws you into the madness
of a woman so steeped in her own bitterness, drowning in her own bile, that its palatable
and shakes you in your seat. And when she is telling off social worker Mrs. Weiss
(played by Mariah Carey), you cannot help but be deeply movedyet you can still hate
her in the end.
The film has won several awards already (like Sundance and Toronto), and no doubt it
will be a strong contender at this years Golden Globes and Academy Awards. If youre
looking for a cheery, light film, go see Alvin and the Chipmunks (which will likely not be
reviewed here). If you only like romantic comedies, pass on this one. But if you don't get
Tyler Perry movies (and I feel your payne), break from the past and see this film.",1408406400,,2296,4.657635467980295

4105814,5,B003BEDAVS,"The full title of this film is ""Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire."" This is a useful distinction, because in any given year, or so I imagine, at least several movies called ""Precious"" are released into theaters, many of which are *not* based on the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire. In addition to these, some movies called ""Precious"" are based on the novel ""Push,"" but not the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire. And yet others are based on novels by Sapphire that are not ""Push."" If you are thinking about watching any of these films, and you are unclear as to which one to watch, I gently urge you to consider this one -- which is called Precious, and which is based on the novel Push, which was written by Sapphire. That's the one you want. The others are less true to the source material, presumably because they are not based on it.

Now, as for the movie itself: it is a gut-wrenching, challenging drama and also a heartwarming character study. Gabourey Sidibe gives the performance of her young career as the titular character, Precious, whom I believe is based on Sapphire, author of the novel Push, upon which this film itself is based.

If you see only one movie called ""Precious"" this year, based on only one novel by only one author, make sure it is ""Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire."" Accept no substitutes!",1405987200,4,1332,4.592436974789916

4105825,5,B003BEDAVS,"I had been wanting to watch this film for a very long time, but never got around to it.

Finally, I did and it was well worth the time.

It paints a pretty accurate picture of the issues plaguing the ""inner city"" and the circular struggle of a never ending path of under achievement.

Unless kids are given the opportunity to excel and explore, the kids in the ""inner city"" will forever be condemned to a path of failure because of racism and the bizarre notion of underfunding under preforming schools. As if giving them less money will somehow make them work harder.

However, it's not just the lack of money, it's the systematic failure of society who neglects whole sections of our population because of race and as a result; poverty creates an atmosphere of: that bettering ones self is tantamount to flaunting ones ability as being somehow ""better"" than your peers.

it's a screwed up philosophy but it's ingrained via years of failure of opportunity, feelings of inadequacy and a general self belief of worthlessness.

Then her Mom jealousy towards her...Mom's alcoholism and no counseling/disfunctionality.  It was heart wretching!!!  Its a wonder this girl didn't have a nervous breakdown or something.
This movie made me realize there are sick people having kids and they're not emotionally stable to be parents.  Great writting...",1396310400,,598,5.6

4105834,5,B003BEDAVS,"this movie has alot of difficult things like childhood physical and sexual violence, so keep that in mind when choosing to watch it, as these can be tough to think about and watch, never mind experience.
the movie is about a teen girl who is abused by her father and mother, has two kids by her father, is very behind in school, and receives help from awesome people, like her GED prep teacher who cares enough to develop relationships with her students and help them grow confident personally and develop academically.
The movie is really deep. Precious' voice-overs are profound, as well as the way the teacher acts and speaks. I usually don't like watching movies a second time, but I would this one.
I love how this movie is so true to life. Life can really suck sometimes. Really really. At the same time though, there is good and there is hope.",1394582400,,850,4.562091503267974

4105846,5,B003BEDAVS,"Most of the movie centers on the acting of Gabourey Sidibe and Monique, not heavy on stars but on honest acting. I didn't go into the movie with any expatiations and was very pleased - I even watched it twice back to back.

Precious is about a abused inner city black teen, abused by just about everyone that knows her but mostly by her mother. The abuse is so hard to watch and know that there are children who do go through this every day. Gabourey doesn't do a lot of dialogue but you see the pain in her face, she says more by saying less and thats to the credit of the director.

You watch the mother of Precious abuse the welfare system, she uses her daughters children to get her more money while openly hating her daughter. The worse part is the telling of Precious mother knowing her father is raping Precious and she does nothing. She does nothing because she wants to be ""taken care"" of, the idea of getting off her bottom and getting a job never occurs to her, she resents and spits hate towards just about anything she wants to control.

Through encouragement Precious finds her way and begins to have dreams for herself and her children. You cheer for all the Precious children in the world.",1391126400,4,1205,4.394618834080718

I think if it had of been fleshed out a bit more...no one with a heart could have watched it. It is not easy to watch as it is. In reality, I forgot I was watching a movie. I actually wanted to slap the mother. I wanted to go through the screen and beat the crap out of her. I wanted to take this child out of the screen and bring her into my home. I know atrocities happen everyday. But, when you are not a part of them...they do not seem real. When you are not a part of them, you close your eyes, don't ask questions, don't get involved. This movie was so well-done that it brought reality into my world of fantasy. I am grateful for that. It clears clouded vision. Makes you want to take that extra couple of minutes with someone..that one extra prodding question that might get a child (or even an adult) to open up and escape. I am a nurse on a post-partum/well baby unit. Sometimes, I don't wan't to know more. I don't want more paperwork. I don't want to care so much, I can't sleep when I get home. This movie...this movie...so what if there is extra paperwork. So what if I don't sleep. This child/young women could be one of my patients. I was profoundly effected by the story. I go into work with a different attitude. I think it makes me not only a better nurse, but a better person. Thank you, Sapphire for telling Precious' story.",1387670400,6,1454,4.196428571428571

4105885,4,B003BEDAVS,"This movie was intense and unforgettable. It was about a teenage girl (Gabourey Sidibe as Precious) who suffered at the hands of her abusive mother for mostly all of her life. She became pregnant and gave birth to a baby probably because she was sexually assaulted by her father or a former boyfriend. At one moment, she imagined that she was a thin white woman who lives a glamorous life. But, she knew that her life was far different from that imagination.

But, I loved that Precious finally escaped and protected herself and her baby from her evil mother. Months later, her evil mother wanted her and the baby to come back and live with her again. However and fortunately, Precious declined and moved forward to a better and independent life with her baby.",1385856000,3,760,4.6716417910447765
4105886,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious is a bleek yet inspirational film unflinchingly capturing abuse and dysfunctional life, largely bolstered by exceptional performances from its cast. To merely call it harrowing or unsparing doesnt quite do it justice. Compelling and uncompromising, a mixed bag of debasement and elation, despair and hope. The film is about improvement and self-actualization with a protagonist who is too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, Black, overweight single mother in the inner city.

Without being familiar with the source material, one really has no idea how much work went into this adaptation or how well it was done. First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher did yeoman's work turning Sapphire's idiomatic graphic novel into a coherent story about the journey of an abused teen.

A potent character study of a world we'd rather pretend does not exist, the film that doesn't shy away from the lower depths of human experience, going into the pathologies that may linger in the closets of some impoverished lives. It also shows the strength and resilience of which humans are capable, even at our lowest moments.

Mo'Nique's performance is frighteningly convincing. Mo'Nique delivers a dynamic performance that incites anger, hate, pity, and then tears at the heart. Mariah Carey's authentically deglammed performance is surprising pitch perfect.

Daniels cast name actors and was able to go beneath their surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right.

Sidibe's debut film is a tribute to her ability to sustain empathy because she completely embodies the massive body of the inarticulate and emotionally shut down Precious character. The film's fantasy sequences show that Sidebe is indeed acting and that she is a joyous person completely different from Precious. Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who actually look. Her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. ""These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,"" she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance.

Paula Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as compassionate.

It's a moving experience, because by the end the viewer has witnessed the birth of a resilient soul. The final scene of revelation between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters is strong enough to be able to leave viewers filled with pity and terror.

A rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, it is a shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely courageous story.",1385769600,,2658,5.311904761904762

I don't know if it's Gabourny's likeability or her talent, but I totally got her and it.  It is now one of my favorite films and she is and has been one of my favorite new actresses ever since ""The Big C"".  Forget the physical, its her spirit and her chutzpa that get me.  I could not believe how good Mo-nike was (ok, probably misspelled her name) and I have admired her for years also.  Mariah Carey without glamor was another thing that affected me.  Now if she would just try doing something like this more often maybe I would have liked her a long time ago.  This movie was funny, heartbreaking, brutal and had many things to say about the gay folk, straight folk and respecting yourself.  Gabourney Sibidne or whatever, I probably misspelled it, is the soul that lights up the screen for the time she gets on it.",1383696000,2,977,4.3535911602209945
4105892,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious is one of the greatest dramas of our time and is sure to be a classic. A modern, urbanized Color Purple, the main character starts out as a victim that eventually finds strength and courage in friendship and love. The acting is incredible. Monique portrays a mother that lives on the system and allows her daughter to be raped repeatedly and impregnated by her spouse (Precious' own father). Her mother grows strong feelings of resentment towards her daughter, blaming her for the actions of ""her man"". Precious' mother abuses her in every way. Monique's performance is incredible and exquisitely showcases her talent. Gabourey Sidibe is also a gifted actress. She flawlessly plays the part of Precious and as the character undergoes change, Sidibe instills hope and triumph. She shows how one should never judge. Precious is afraid to open up to people about her situation at first  and comes across as rude and indignant. The viewer gets a sneak peak into her soul with Sadibe's voice over. The actress is able to transition effortlessly.
Mariah Carey is also great in her role, a social worker for the department of social services. The students and teacher also give great performances and help us to understand how the system treats people and how welfare is a form of enslavement.
Set in the late 80's it also shows how little things have changed and how the system remains broken",1383523200,3,1395,4.886075949367089

4105919,4,B003BEDAVS,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. It shows how one can make it out of the depths of poverty and abuse into the light with a little help from friends and government assistance. There are many young girls out there living in abuse and poverty, but they need educational programs like the one in the movie to help. It shows that we can't just give money away, but we have to educate along the way.",1378252800,,392,4.3108108108108105

4105922,2,B003BEDAVS,"I'll concede this: once I started watching *Precious*, I couldn't stop. So it did grab my attention and I did get immersed in it. But afterwards, I started wondering: would this film get such acclaim for being so ""compelling"" if Precious had been light-skinned and attractive, and her babies fathered by two different teenagers from her neighborhood rather than her own father? If her mother beat her, not in some systematic attempt at sadism, but because the mother herself was raised in an environment where throwing things at your kids' heads was considered a normal way to discipline them? Something uncomfortable in me says it would not, because for white people that would be the way they assume all black people live. *Precious* takes stereotypes to an extreme, perhaps to get over that hump. But to me it just made the film seem artificial. And the ending did not seem hopeful to me. In the era the film is set in, AIDS was an instant death sentence. All we see is Precious walking into the sunset with her kids (who seem completely undamaged even though they were born into the same family as Precious). In real life, Precious would've died within a year or so, meanwhile having no idea how to raise her kids in a loving home because the only example she ever had was her own mother. It just didn't ring true to me. I would've liked to end up feeling hopeful, as the movie tried to do, but there was just too much that seemed contrived and too neatly wrapped up. I would like to see a film that gave a more nuanced view of the world Precious came from.",1377475200,4,1561,4.519434628975265

The acting and directing are also excellent. I don't think Mariah Carey gets the credit for her acting ability that she should. I like all of the films I've seen her in. This is not a film about black American ghetto folks living in the hood. Precious could very easily be a fat white girl with the sexually abusive father and the very angry abusive mother who is cheating the welfare system. I've also been around white folks who are like this. It's more about class then about race. The ending is realistic because there is always one chicken who flew the coup so to speak.

Conveying a message to watchers that given certain situations awful things happen and but it's how you deal with it and try to move forward. Sadly i've read far too many reviews citing this film inspired racism or reflected negatively on black people. I don't see that, since Precious's situation and circumstances are not determined by race but by poverty and lack of education. The same issues affect all races around the world with little or no education living impoverished lives.

Thumbs up for the director brave enough to bring it to the big screen. However being from the UK our BBC drama's and screenplays have explored these subjects which provoke just as much consternation without exploiting the black struggle message.

It is simply a terribly sad story that was well acted, especially by the mother.",1345334400,,966,4.813253012048193
4106070,5,B003BEDAVS,"Gabourey Sibide, as Precious, is every bit as good as I've heard. The script has some problems, but not with the part of Precious. Her character is inspirational without being unrealistic. We like Precious, we feel empathy for her character and her circumstances, but we're not manipulated into liking her.

The only problem I have with this film - and it's not really the fault of the film - is that it seems to focus all of the ""blame"" on the mother and father. I think that this was a dramatic decision that was made, and it wasn't meant to ignore all the other factors which create the kind of environment that kids like Precious live in. When a movie depicts a rough life in the ghetto, that doesn't mean it has to get into all of the complicated stuff that creates ghettos in the first place. Nor does it have to get into what we, as a society, could do to help kids who are trapped in toxic environments. It's all too easy to hate and blame the parents, but for ignoring the rest of it I was going to give this movie three or four stars. After I thought about it, I saw this film as a powerful slice - a small slice - of a big problem that we have in America. I realized that the narrow perspective, the narrow focus, also distilled the power of this drama. This is a powerful drama, not a comprehensive documentary.

Some critics see this film as depressing, stereotyping, exploitative, etc. I don't see any of that (except for depressing, maybe, but not all movies can be about happy circumstances, right?). I've not seen anyone make a good case of how the film exploits anyone, and the mere fact that it depicts abusive black characters in a ghetto doesn't ""prove"" that it's stereotyping, any more than a movie depicting abusive white characters is stereotyping. The unfortunate fact is that there is plenty of abuse going on in America. To be guilty of stereotyping, a book or film must imply that ALL people of a certain class or ethnicity behave in a certain way. This film does not do that. Also, let me suggest that if this film was about a white girl living in the ghetto, getting abused by white parents, it would be just as powerful, assuming that the white girl was as good an actress as Gabourey. :-)

A minor problem I had with the film - and this is a personal quirk of mine - is that all of the ""good"" people were physically attractive. The teacher at the alternative school, the case worker, Nurse John. If this film is guilty of one stereotype, then that's it: Good people are good looking. Of course, the notable exception here is Precious herself, but I think the film subtly implies that Precious might not be obese if she had grown up in better circumstances. That being said, the teacher, and her girlfriend, and the case worker (Mariah Carey) were all beautiful, so I'm not complaining too much. It's a movie, after all. The thing is, I know that people who are beautiful inside come in all kinds of packages, and I think Hollywood sometimes forgets that. :-)",1345248000,3,2990,4.462522851919561

Tell me why is she still living there when she tells a social worker she has a kid by her dad? Also in the end  the social worker just gets up and leaves after talking to Precious' mom. I'm thinking to myself why isn't CPS doing their job? Why wasn't she put in a better home sooner?

4106076,4,B003BEDAVS,"When I was a child, ""after school"" specials were a common occurence on TV.  These low-budget films essentially took a social issue of the day that affected young people and dramatized them in a way to be lesson-learning.  ""Precious"" falls into that category, though it is significantly more hard-edged than anything that would have been on television in those days.  Or today.  It is a blisteringly honest film and a capable drama that focuses on Precious Jones, a character who generates great pathos without being pathetic.  She has been dealt just about every bad card that life can -- poor, abused, illiterate.  She is overweight, a life situation seemingly brought upon by her psychotic mother (played realistically and with vicious cunning by comedienne Mo'Nique), who lashes out at her daughter verbally and physically, including making her stuff herself, all while letting the girl's father rape her whenever he feels like it.  The result is two children, one with Down's Syndrome.  If you think things can't get more challenging, wait.  What is amazing about ""Precious"" is how easily it piles on the tragedies and yet remains a steadfastly optimistic film.  That's mainly the result of the deceptively natural performance of Gaboury Sidibe, who never lets the character tread into stereotype -- even as some may say that the character herself embodies stereotype -- and director Lee Daniels, who has the talent to generally stay out of the way and let the story tell itself.  Never having read the source novel by Sapphire, I can only comment that the writing of the film by screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher is for the most part more than satisfying.  The dialogue is natural, especially when Precious narrates; if there is a flaw, it's that while the film does an admirable job of showing her outward struggles, it doesn't always give us the insight to her interior that we might want.  Think of films that similarly showed a young woman's struggle against the odds stacked against her, like ""Rachel, Rachel,"" ""Georgie Girl,"" or ""The Color Purple,"" and how they allowed their subjects more internal space.  Precious deserves it.  Though she sometimes struggles to capture the gravitas of her character, Mariah Carey deserves special attention for appearing as a world weary social worker without her usual glamourous makeup; Paula Patton (hubba, hubba) got my attention even more with it -- I feel a little guilty saying that given the emotional importance of the story, but let's be honest.

4106096,1,B003BEDAVS,"So I saw Precious, again, last night with a group of friends. We all just laughed at it. A friend and I spent the two hours reenacting the ""Precious! Precious!"" scene from Silence of the Lambs. The exception was one girl who watched the movie cuddled up to her boyfriend in terror, inexpressibly disgusted at the torrent of despair porn the film inflicted on her. It wasn't the reaction you'd expect from a film that, to take a random critical blurb, is ""full of life and love, well-meaning and, judging by the reaction in the US, a genuine and important phenomenon that says act- don't dwell- on your dreams.""

But it's not surprising that bougie middle-class critics liked it. Precious is class warfare, naked and in-your-face class warfare, albeit of the patronizing liberal variety. To put it as simply as possible: everyone in the movie who's working class (save for Precious) is an awful person, while everyone who's a middle class professional is an absolute saint.

The film doesn't exactly give the poor characters devil horns and draw halos around the wealthier ones, but it comes as close as possible to doing so with one of the crudest devices available to film: it makes the poor people physically ugly (and very black), and it casts pretty and light skinned actresses as the middle class professionals (Mariah Carey is one of them). And boy, does the movie rub that difference in your face. You're treated to extended sequences of Precious' obese mom eating a greasy piece of chicken or dancing in skin tight clothing before going out to a club. The intended reaction of such lingering and voyeuristic shots is nothing but sheer disgust. There's an Oberlin student out there somewhere with 1000 words on how this is ""the exploitation and objectification of black bodies""; suffice it to say that this isn't observant sociology but zoology.

There are good guys in the movie. The first, Mariah Carey, is Precious' social worker: patient, helpful, and smiley, not the harried and overworked bureaucratic functionary that real poor people are accustomed to working with. She directs her to light-skinned woman number two, Precious' teacher, who's a lesbian- I think we're actually meant to rejoice at how progressive that is- that lives with her partner in a tastefully adorned house with plenty of books and, I think, a piano.

And for the working class people? There's Precious' stepfather, who is only shown raping and impregnating her in flashbacks; the previously mentioned obese mother who hates and abuses Precious for being raped by her husband; obnoxious classmates in her old school who tease her for being fat and won't let her ""learn"" (her white teacher, on the other hand, is portrayed as another well-meaning savior, although he's helpless against the tide of cruelty directed at him by the poor kids); and street kids who harass and hurt her on the street for being overweight. Her neighbors in her apartment are invisible, non-existent; they don't even call the cops when Precious' mom beats her or pop their heads out of their apartments even to investigate.

There are her fellow classmates who are all girls and thus are all naturally bitchy, catty, and superficial. They're all initially hostile to Precious but are magically civilized by the light-skinned teacher (as is the typical power fantasy in these movies), and they even accompany Precious to the hospital where she gives birth to her baby- although they spend most of the time there hitting on a light skinned doctor. There's literally not a single poor character in the movie who is kind, or intelligent, or at all mutifaceted. At best the poor characters are just window dressing, at worst they're repulsive caricatures. And all of them are there in their resplendent ugliness simply so the film can brag that it's ""keeping it real."" The film's ""gritty realism,"" however, is deployed in only one direction on the socio-economic ladder.

Precious herself is neither good or bad; she purely neutral, having less agency and independence than any other film protagonist I've seen for some time. Most of the film she spends crying and moaning about how she ""can't do it,"" which sets her up to be immediately reassured by her betters. The plot more or less proceeds in such a manner. She's merely the territory, the beautiful soul, fought over by the working class beasts and the middle class beauties. The film is tireless in patronizing her, but the two ladies pictured above do all the thinking and acting for her- which is the real reason the establishment critics like the movie; it flatters them. (Spoiler alert: the light skinned middle class people win her from the poor people in the end.) The name of the film even implies as much: she's ""Precious,"" like a gem, a pretty object owned by somebody to be doted upon.

Anyway, if I was a poor, working class person, particularly a poor black person, I think I would be absolutely furious at this movie. The system that represses them is beautiful and heroic for trying to save the poor from their own awfulness; the problem with poverty is poor people themselves. Now one can see why Precious received the critical acclaim that it did (it got a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes) in spite of its absolute lack of good qualities: it tells middle class critics that working class problems are all theirs to solve, that their failure in solving them isn't their fault, and that their ideology of patronizing liberalism is the savior of America's wretched. Like much propaganda, Precious is the voyeuristic exploitation of caricatured human ugliness for narrow political purposes.",1301356800,16,5623,4.931362196409715
4106097,4,B003BEDAVS,"There are some movies that are so dark and so gritty you almost have to muster up the presence of mind to even watch them. Such is the case for 2009 Best Picture nominee ""Precious"", about a black girl in Harlem who has to overcome an abusive mother, an incestuous father, obesity, illiteracy and bearing two children by the time she is sixteen years old.

Based on the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire, this drama is not unlike a tiny sprout attempting to push up toward the sun out of the broken concrete sidewalks of the inner city. It unflinchingly takes on taboos and stereotypes, while simultaneously making you fall in love with a very unlikely heroine.

Make no mistake. This is a powerful hero's journey that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences acknowledged with six Oscar nominations. These included best picture of the year, as well as Best Lead Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Directing, Best Editing and Best Screenplay Adaptation.

The strength of this story relies a ton on the two nominated actresses - newcomer Gabourey Sidibe in the title role, as well as Mo'Nique, who plays Precious' abusive mother, Mary. Their relationship is the catalyst for every challenge that Precious faces in her life, and both of these actresses deliver a heart wrenching, painfully cutting depiction of abuse, hatred, resentment and yearning.

Our story starts with Precious in her public high school. She's a daydreamer, which gets her through the bitter reality she faces when she goes home to face her mother. Mary is the stereotypical inner city welfare mother who has no interest in making any attempts to better herself or her family. She just wants her check, and she's willing to put up with just about anything to get it.

This includes allowing her man to sexually abuse her daughter. Director Lee Daniels makes the very shrewd decision to only show us the barest glimpses of the violence; this content is a bitter pill to swallow without any unnecessary details that would border on exploitation. Instead it takes you right up to the brink of your tolerance and then allows you - like Precious - a welcome reprieve from the depravity one only need hints toward in order to get the full effect.

That is why we see things from the POV of Precious as she daydreams of a life far, far away from the situations she is unable to escape except in her mind.

The beacon of hope comes from a no-nonsense teacher named Ms. Rain, played with the appropriate amount of toughness and tenderness by Paula Patton. Precious is taken from the public school system and placed in an alternative education atmosphere - which means she's surrounded with other girls not too different from herself.

They all have their own crosses to bear, not to mention chips on their shoulders.

But somehow in this motley crew we see Precious begin to blossom. After she gets over the initial resistance learning to read and write, she finds that she's not so stupid after all - and that those insults she had endured from her mother were wrong, very wrong.

All those daydreams and fanciful thoughts find their way into her journal once she is given the tools to use one, and this sets that bound bird inside her heart free.

It is with acceptance from these new people in her life (including her social worker Mrs. Weiss - played convincingly by a surprisingly plain Mariah Carey), that Precious begins to grow and blossom ...a little sprout reaching for the sun.

There are scenes that will break you. There are scenes that will anger you. There are scenes that will make you cheer, and scenes that will break your heart. But at the end when you're looking back you'll see that Precious summed it up eloquently with:

PRECIOUS (V.O.)
The other day I cried, felt stupid.
Guess what...* that other day.
Thas why God or whoever make new
days.

Indeed.

It is with that mix of vulnerability and strength, defeat and determination that carries the audience through these very dark passages through the human experience. This has everything to do with lead actress Gabby Sidibe. We hang in there because she does. We find strength to endure because she does. We never give up hope... because she doesn't.

So when she breaks down and demands who is going to love someone like her, the audience is ready to embrace her and say, ""I will.""

Gabby can feel very accomplished to have brought such an amazingly complicated character to life, especially for her film debut.

Which is why she was nominated.

Mo'Nique's bravery to attempt such a detestable character has been rewarded several times in addition to her Oscar win. Few of us can fathom the courage it took to bring such a flawed character to life with such dedication to character integrity. In the end we understood that hurt people hurt people, and somewhere along the line Mary never had the angels of mercy swoop in from unexpected places to save her like her daughter.

Another deserved win was Best Adapted Screenplay. It's not easy to pull together a story that can walk the line so delicately between sensationalism and realism as eloquently as this story has done, but scribe Geoffrey Fletcher has indeed accomplished this emotional ballet well with very shrewd choices that make this journey through such depravity worth it in the end.

It is not an easy film to watch - but sometimes those are the best kind. They remind us all that in everything is a gift of the universe, even the bad stuff.

The tag line says it all.  ""Life is hard. Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.""",1301270400,2,5551,4.735477178423237

4106099,4,B003BEDAVS,"`Precious' is the story of a 16 year old girl who is pregnant for the second time (by her father) and who, despite getting good grades at school up to now, gets sent to remedial classes as she is unable to read and write. She is physically and psychology abused by her mother, she is beaten, treated like a slave and told she is dumb and stupid on a daily basis. Her only escape is to delve into various fantasies inside her head, about becoming a famous movie star or singer, or having loving parents for example and these fantasy sections contrast markedly with her harsh reality. She soon makes friends and finds inspiration in her teacher in her new class and feels a certain sense of belonging amongst the other misfits, whilst her life still remains hard. All in all this is a pretty bleak film, but it also has a certain element of hope running through due to Precious' tenacious attitude and inner strength. There are good performances from the entire cast (which even includes a small part for Lenny Kravitz) and the direction is excellent as well. This has been highly lauded and for good reason, it isn't necessarily an upbeat film, but it is portrayed so well the whole way through and makes you empathise with the main character. It is definitely worth checking out at some point, but be aware of it's gritty and (at times) bleak feel.

Imagine my surprise when the movie started.

Ok, the good.
Stellar performances from the cast.
Direction, pacing, pretty much everything is perfect.

The bad?
The subject matter.
I had a VERY hard time getting to the end of the movie.
Excessive swearing, voilence, etc...

I don't want to tell what the movie is about, I'm not big on spoiling it for those who haven't seen it.
But trust me, this film will make you think.
It WILL make you uncomfortable.
This movie should be mandatory viewing for anyone who harms a child.

I'd put ""Precious"" right up there with ""The Road"" as one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.
I'll never watch this movie again either, there's no reason to.
This isn't a film you sit down to with a bucket of pop corn.
I'll give a recommendation for people who can stomach the subject of severe child abuse.
For sensitive viewers, please approach with caution.
This movie gave me nighmares, which I think was it's intent.

4106101,5,B003BEDAVS,"This is one of those films that you want to keep stopping, thinking, ""I'll finish this later..."" Yet I couldn't. It's a wonderful, horrifying film. I was glad for the occasional ""dream sequences"", where Precious imagined herself as a movie star or model. They provided this odd sort of relief -- not comic relief, exactly -- but an ephemeral relief from all the despair. It does end happily, in it's own way, but even then, you don't know what will become of her.

The acting is exquisite and perfect and wonderful. This is not a film you want to put on just to ""watch a movie."" Put it on when you are ready for something really, deeply moving and life-changing (don't mean to sound overwrought, but it's true).",1293667200,2,711,4.5546875
4106102,5,B003BEDAVS,"This is a great movie. I could see using it as the basis for a college class on sexual predators and how they choose their victims. It would be great for discussion. There were a lot of questions that the movie left unanswered. Although the movie is about Precious, and the mom is portrayed as this evil bitch, you come to realize that her mother is a victim, too. That they are both victims of a sexual predator. What the movie fails to address is why the guy isn't arrested and put in jail for his crimes. Even though Precious ends up telling the social worker what he did, the social worker doesn't call the cops, she instead just blames the mom and herself walks away from it. The onus falls on the mother, instead of on the male sexual predator who used her in order to get to her child, Precious. I think that is a fault of what is otherwise a great movie. Another fault is this weird scene where Precious imagines she is white, like she thinks none of this would be happening if she were white. However, bad things happen to white people, too. Also, it doesn't fit in with the rest of the story as she consistently imagines herself as black and in a good place, except for the once.

4106106,3,B003BEDAVS,"The open casting call for Precious cannot have had a large turnout. Just how many three hundred pound teenagers can portray the harrowing life of an illiterate girl ferociously abused by her mother; impregnated twice by her father; and who lives now on welfare in a decrepit home in Harlem. And yet, Leah Daniels-Butler, the casting director, might well have found someone with more emotional depth than Gabourey Sidibe.
 Precious, quite frankly, is an artistic mess. The movie opens softly, views of a bridge's underpass, the tinkling of a music box. We see Precious, looking chic and mod, being approached by a thin woman in an orange evening dress. Wait. Isn't this supposed to be about a tortured, underprivileged teenager? Yes, it is, as the harsh ring of a school bell interrupts the fantasy and we are thrown whole-heartedly into Precious' world through her own narrative. ""I wanna be on the cover of a magazine. But first I wanna be in one a' dem BET videos. Mama says I can't dance. She says who wanna see my big ass dancin' anyhow?"" Scene after scene shows Precious being abused; delinquents in her class make fun of her, a boy on the street pushes her down, and of course her cruel, vicious, retched, utterly horrifying mother (the only shining light in the film, Mo'Nique). Precious lives the worst life imaginable. Yet, through what should be an emotional rollercoaster, Sidibe gives us one facial expression: blank. She gives one voice: monotone. A little smirk comes to her lips when thinking about her cute math teacher...and that's about it. The audience is met with a girl who should feel everything, anything and yet gives barely a glimmer of feeling. One could argue that Sidibe plays Precious as being numb; that her life and circumstances have brought her down so much that her only way out is to not feel anything. Plausible? Sure. Entertaining cinema? Negative.
 Cinematographically, this movie does not know what it wants to be. Sepia tones bring us into Precious' home grittily and beautifully. Yellowish light is cast over the small apartment, taking us into a place where no one would ever want to live. If only this lasted the duration of the film. When Precious arrives for her first day of the ""alternative school"", Each One Teach One, after she was expelled from her public high school for getting pregnant, white light settles over the teacher, Blu Rain (a charming yet typical Paula Patton) and the classroom, cheesy symbolism for Precious' hopeful future if she continues with her education. Sometimes the film is shot in handheld but not nearly enough. The entire film should have been shot in handheld--it would have better captured the personal and very real quality that the director, Lee Daniels, and presumably Sapphire, the author of the original novel Push, intended. A major mistake in this film was the direction (and quite possibly inclusion) of Precious' fantasies. At various moments, we follow Precious into a dream world, one where she is a movie star, adored by millions, with beautiful clothes and a light-skinned boyfriend that dotes on her. These fantasies are so cheaply shot and frankly ruin what had the potential to be a stunning, powerful film. For a story so grounded in reality, why take us into these surreal moments that add nothing to the film itself? Daniels, you are not Fellini. Don't try to be. Perhaps the intention behind the breaks in reality were sound; Precious is a teenage girl who dreams of a better life, of course, who in her situation wouldn't fantasize about something more? Her dreams are just presented so cheaply. When Precious looks through a photo album, the pictures talk to her. When she is getting dressed in the morning, she sees a blonde, white girl in the mirror. Visually projecting Precious' desires in this manner detracts from the gritty realism of her situation. The dialogues of her Each One Teach One classmates are light-hearted and humorous, providing a much-needed break from Precious' depressing conditions. ""You've got a nasty ass hat"" is a retort to ""you've got a nasty ass mouth""; that is much more laugh- and smile-inducing than Precious waltzing down a red carpet.
 The real reason this film deserves any attention is Mo'Nique's performance as Precious' mother. She is phenomenal. She brings this despicable, disgusting, maniacal woman to life with vicious ferocity. Her eyes are filled with hatred whenever she looks at Precious. Her slow draws on her cigarettes evoke a slovenly and sluggish existence. Our introduction to this vile woman is when she throws a heavy pan at Precious' head. Yet Mo'Nique brings several dimensions to this potentially one-sided character. She dances while watching $10,000 Pyramid and wearing a floral jumpsuit. She makes sure she puts on a wig before the welfare woman comes to visit. Her shifts from speaking sweetly and softly to the visitor to instantly cursing at Precious tell it all. Yet her pain is revealed bitterly in her final scene in the office of the social worker, Ms. Weiss (a completely banal and bland Mariah Carey). Mo'Nique conveys this woman's pain with breathtaking honesty. This final scene makes us see that maybe she wasn't always a monster; that she has been deeply scarred and acts like this out of her own anguish. Does this excuse her actions? We're left feeling something for this woman that maybe we didn't feel before. Mo'Nique's performance is absolutely exquisite.
 One word on Mariah Carey's performance: any decent actress could have portrayed this minor role. Casting Carey in this film was a cheap move on the casting director's part in trying to get acclaim and attention. They took a celebrity known for her glamour, removed her makeup and filmed her with a handheld camera; suddenly she's supposed to be a brilliant actress who should be forgiven for that atrocity known as Glitter. Don't be fooled.
 Precious is meant to be an emotionally trying experience. However, Geoffrey Fletcher's screenplay hits us over the head time and time again with tragedy after tragedy. Yes, Precious' life is a tragedy. It's impossible not to feel pity. Positive or negative feelings aside, it is a visceral and tear-jerking film, but for circumstance alone. Fletcher and Daniels should have let us live more with these characters as they were, without feeling the need to stomp on Precious while she's way down.",1291766400,3,6375,4.970946579194002

4106112,3,B003BEDAVS,"This means simply that, no matter how hard one tries to delve into the inner workings of another person's mind, it will ultimately prove itself to be a naively valiant but futile effort.  In this movie, a girl who has all the makings of a borderline personality or DID patient, in her odd little oblivion, retreats on occasion to a fantasy land, where she can be a singer, loved by everyone surrounding her, and yet has the ego strength to persevere.  This is certainly admirable in its own way.  Precious's mother can very easily be vilified, and in the end may have evoked sympathy from some people; I can say that the nice little bow they wrapped around her story to explain why she turned into such a feral creature is only the tip of the sunken ship.  Trying to understand it simply from that perspective, I would say that yes, there are Oedipal undertones, there was a defended regression and a concretization of symbolic struggles the mother was clearly facing; in attacking her daughter she was attacking vulnerability, devaluing her was her way of not only identifying with whatever nameless aggressor she had in the past, but it was also a way of self-injury by identifying with the vulnerable, frail individual her daughter represented.  Not much to say about the disdain shown to the mentally challenged child Precious bred, nor about Mariah Carey's inevitably stereotyped role as a bleeding heart who eventually swallowed the mother's primitive push towards becoming another rejecting external object.  Ugh... I think they wanted people to empathize with how this girl overcame the odds to push forth with her life, despite all these horrid adversities facing her.  That works too, but we can't understand her world any better than we can the mother's, and it says something of the viewers' ability to withstand realities that go against their own moral code without bringing out projections of their own.  It's hard to swallow such egregiously vicious personalities without responding with an equal dose of aggression.  But movies are interpretation, and mine is just one more amongst 6 billion.",1283126400,2,2109,4.96875

Indeed, I did think the acting was great, and appreciate the innovative use of camera technique. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the overall product.

Part of the problem is that the film simply piles a lot of depressing twists and turns without any variation or break. I don't want to sound hard-hearted here - I understand that some people unfortunately do find themselves in such depressing situations. However, even movies that focus on hardship usually have some variation in the amount of depression plot twists they throw at the audience. For example, some movies show a character's hardship, but then end with her triumphant redemption. Other movies chose to intersperse moments of levity throughout the movie so viewers don't become dulled to the character's pain. I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pursuit-of-Happyness-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000N6U0E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pursuit of Happyness (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;does this beautifully (I almost did cry for that one).

Instead, it feels like the director is trying desperately to make his audience tear up by throwing one misery after another, without ever giving us a reason to like Precious herself. While I felt sorry for her plight, she also comes across as devoid of common sense and rude. She calls her child with Down Syndrome ""mongoloid"" (a racist term for Asians). Her greatest joy seems to be stealing a bucket of fried chicken. Meanwhile I never found any inner strength or inspiration in her that made me really want to root for her. Without that emotional anchor, I found myself becoming overwhelmed and ultimately desensitized to what she was experiencing.

There were a few times when the movie tries to lighten up, but these fail. For example, the scenes when she fantasizes about becoming a star were just way too long, and the style jarred too much with the rest of the film. Precious playing with her newborn baby in the pool and dunking him in the water was (I think) intended to be a moment of joy, but all I could help thinking was that this girl should not be allowed to keep the baby! Likewise, the ending doesn't really inspire much hope or warmth. In fact, the denouement happened so quickly I almost missed it.

I really wish I could give this film a higher rating. It does educate viewers about the very real problems that some young women struggle with every day. Also, again, the acting is superb. Unfortunately, rather than be drawn in emotionally, I felt detached from Precious. It's too bad, because just a few changes could have made this work so well.",1282780800,5,3523,5.97029702970297

This is a very thought provoking and brutally honest movie about a girl who was consistently raped by her father and both verbally and physically abused by her mother.  The only thing that keeps her sane throughout these horrors is to imagine herself as a Cinderella at the Ball kind of character.

Precious is failing school but one teacher recognizes in her, an aptitude for math.  The guidence counseler recommends that Precious go to a special education school.  There Precious is treated with respect and slowly starts to come out of her shell and start to have goals for herself.

All the while, her mother is doing her utmost to prevent Precious from learning, constantly calling her stupid and telling her she can never be anything.  Her mother is a couch potato who only cares about fooling the welfare agency to keep her check coming.

She has two children who are fathered none other than her dad. The mother of Precious was abusive towards her; she believed that her daughter had taken her man away, the man whom she loved. Despite the fact that Precious got kicked out of school, she got the opportunity to enter in a special school that helped her get the education needed. Ms. Rain was a teacher whom actually paid attention to Precious due to the potential she saw in her. She always supported and encouraged Precious to change every aspect of her life towards the best. As Precious goes on with her life through the tough times, she has learned to love her fellow classmates and become a dedicated mother.
In my opinion, this book was well descriptive. It seemed as though the reader was there and knew how she felt. Another reason why this is a great book is due to the writing process that was chosen. Sapphire expresses well Precious thoughts and emotions in her poems. You can actually feel the hatred and pain that she carried within. Sapphire whom is the author, gives the readers a sense of how Precious thought of each person. Precious is an admirable girl even though people have perceived her as mean, selfish, and judgmental.

4106119,3,B003BEDAVS,"This movie has obviously garnered a lot of praise, but I have to be honest and say that, subjectively, it didn't do much for me.

One could argue that the movie does a service by showing us how truly miserable the circumstances of some people are, so that we understand and maybe even try to help.  But I'm already well aware that there are countless people in similar or worse circumstances, both within and beyond the US.  And I already care and try to help where I can.  In other words, the movie didn't tell me anything new and didn't compel me to do anything different.  Moreover, I didn't find that the movie portrayed these bad circumstances with any distinctive subtlety or nuances.  The experience of watching this movie was like the experience of having a run-of-the-mill nightmare.

A different argument would be that the character of Precious shows us that people can be resilient, can break out of the vicious cycles in which they appear to be trapped, and can thereby show us the power of hope.  But does the movie really show that?  It seems to me that, at the end of the movie, Precious was on her way to improving her circumstances, but the improvement was about going from absolutely horrible to merely lousy circumstances, not from bad to good.  I personally don't find that all that uplifting.

As far as the acting, it was pretty good across the board.  As expected, the lead actors were strong, and the surprise for me was Mariah Carey's entirely believable portrayal of a social worker.  Who knew that she can act?

Considering all of the above points, I can only give this movie three stars, and I can only recommend it to people who's lives have been too short or sheltered to realize how bad some people have it out there.",1278460800,6,1748,4.578778135048232

The acting is superb.  The direction is stupendous.  The script deservedly won an Oscar for Geoffrey Fletcher.  Afterward I was left with a slight disappointment in the final effort.  I'm left in a quandry thinking maybe the film doesn't live up to the hype or possibly as good as the script is that the novel it's based on may be a tad thin.  Regardless, I recommend ""Precious"" for a multitude of reasons notably the powerful lead performance by Gabourey Sidibe that deservedly garnered her an Oscar nomination as well as Mo'Nique's Oscar winning turn as her mother that could have been cliched in less able hands.  Rod Daniels' direction is superb employing harrowing realism, voiceover, and fantasy sequences that in conjunction with Fletcher's script give the film the feel of a novel as opposed to a filmization of a novel.

I could not imagine that courage that it took to make this novel into a movie.  It is not just the topic of incest but also a wonder if director and screenwriter can portray book characters the way that they are developed in a book.  I must say that movie is easier to watch that the book was to read.  Actresses in this film all did fantastic job in portraying women from different backgrounds, both social and racial.

The story is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  Precious has a horrendous home life, and she has obviously been overlooked in school.  An early scene in the movie demonstrates the state of the school she attends, and it's not good.  After she enrolls in an alternative school, we learn that she is borderline illiterate but got an A- in English at her last school.  Through all of this and the fact that Precious is pregnant with her second child (from her father), she continues to show her strength and will to become better at everything.

The performances throughout the film are nothing short of outstanding, and Mo'Nique's potrayal of Precious' abusive mother is nothing short of jaw-dropping.  Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz both perform wonderfully in their roles with Carey really surprising me.  I had no idea it was her until the end.

The movie is very disturbing, and I can only imagine how much more disturbing the novel is.  Through the disturbing scenes and images, though, hopes shines through.  I found myself really liking Precious' character and loathing that of her mother.  With the type of subject matter, this movie could have been nothing more than shocking, but the performances and the excellent direction made it one of the best movies of 2009.",1276041600,2,1519,4.88671875
4106126,4,B003BEDAVS,"This is one of the most powerful and memorable movies I've seen in a while. Though there is an overabundance of swearing, and there are some scenes that are difficult to watch, in the end I thought these aspects of the film made it even more realistic, and made the main character that much more likable. One of the things I particularly liked is that it isn't a cliched story with one-dimensional ""good"" and ""evil"" characters. ""Precious"" Jones and her mother evoke a variety of emotions ranging from disgust and hatred, to pity, to compassion.

The soundtrack really suits the story as well (as we see in the song, ""Happy"" featured in the trailer). I really enjoyed it.

I know some reviewers have called the movie racist and exploitative, but I found Prescious's desire to overcome her circumstances inspirational. Abuse happens to children of every ethnicity and economic status, and abuse movies have centered on characters from pretty much every ethnicity and status (remember ""Mommy Dearest? How about ""Radio Flyer"" or ""Stand by Me?"").

The quote in the movie's credits which reads, ""To precious girls everywhere,"" sounds to me like the author meant for her work to reach every abused or struggling child. I don't really think it's fair to call the film racist or exploitative simply because the abuser  is African American.

Though you may find the story a little hard to take, I think most people will appreciate this film in the end.",1275609600,3,1442,4.869387755102041
4106127,1,B003BEDAVS,"I have had time to digest Precious for a long time now. And I've come to a conclusion: There TRULY are an incredible number of stereotypes piled one upon another in the two main characters.

Monique did an incredible acting job in one of the last scenes, but that doesn't negate the fact that her dark-skinned black character was poor, loud, lazy, welfare-abusing, and a deviant (the last one being beyond stereo-type in the 21st century)

While Tyler Perry and Oprah were behind the making of this story, that doesn't make them immune to making a movie based on black stereotypes. All of us are living in the same country watching the same harmful images over and over again. None of us is immune to absorbing stereotypes and failing to recognize them--even stereotypes derogatory to one's own race.

Tyler Perry's movies--while I am a fan of those B-movies of his--do cross over into stereotype-land quite often. Yet, Tyler Perry's movies have music blacks can identify with, crazy characters (even some of the stereotypes) to identify with, humor blacks can identify with, and biblical values that come out when times get rough. But that doesn't erase the fact that the stereotypes are always there. And Precious is not only NOT an exception it is worse by far (see the laundry list above for Monique's character).

When I first watched this movie, through the lens of FUBU (for us by us) I saw all the characters as black--the same way I see my own family.  But I still (initially) came away from the movie wondering if the point being made about sexual abuse wasn't buried in the muck.

Later, when I realized all the attention the movie was getting and that the general public was watching the movie too, I saw it through new eyes and realized something else. This movie is similar to The Blindside in that all the characters that have any proactive-ness to them at all--are pale. In The Blindside the heroes are white, while in Precious all the rescue-ers are light-skinned (all the actors in rescue-er roles appear to be first-generation, mixed race) which  might make Precious a 21st century Uncle Tom's Cabin.

Compare Precious and The Blindside to The Secret Life of Bees: Dakota Fanning's character is abused and needs help, but she is not some blank-faced blob who will simply expire if someone doesn't come along and scrape her off the ground. I don't know why movies like Precious and The Blindside can only feel satisfying to some folk if the darker-skinned person being helped is an ultimate victim, nearly crawling on their hands and knees. (Yes, The Blindside's a true story--but so what? There are millions of OTHER true uplifting interracial stories that could be told--but they ARE NOT interesting unless...there is a dark,helpless,ultimate victim and a light/white hero)

Electing a Black President isn't the end of progress. It's the next leap forward. And I see that progress has already been made in imagery we're seeing just on television: Look at how many people of color (all shades and ethnicities) are being shown with whole families selling laundry detergent or going to department stores in commercials now. And I think, down the road, consciousness will raise and more and more people will see Precious as stereotyping mess that it is.

(By the way, a movie called ""The Celebration"" deals with sexual abuse and the struggles of the adults who've endured it much, much better if you can deal with the subtitles---It's excellent. It even touches on race a bit.)",1275609600,15,3493,4.865319865319865

4106131,1,B003BEDAVS,"Before I saw Lee Daniel's ""Precious"" I perceived it as a poorly made exploitative racist film that perpetuates the worst stereotypes about black people. Six months later and eight dollars poorer after watching Lee Daniels' ""Precious"" at a matinee, I still see the movie as a poorly made exploitative racist film that perpetuates the worst stereotypes about black people. Critics hail this movie as a masterpiece of film-making, I regard it as the most offensive film since Birth of a Nation.

Adapted from the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire Precious is tells the story of Clarice ""Precious"" Jones, a morbidly obese sixteen-year old with a lot of issues. Stuck in the eighth grade reading at a second grade level, She's pregnant for the second time by her father, a nameless man mixed among a montage of bacon grease and Vaseline. Kicked out of school, she's sent home to her mother Mary, a foul-mouthed stereotypical Regan era welfare queen who only cares about making welfare money off her daughter and keeping her case open so she cans sit on her butt and watch TV all day. After getting knocked out by moms and in between a profanity laced argument between Mary and Precious we watch as the enthusiastic Principal (who was apathetic as she kicked Precious out of her wonderful public school) comes out in the rain (This doesn't happen in real life. I went to public school in the 1980's and no one came out to your house; they just pushed you to the next grade regardless of your grades) to tell her about Each One, Teach One, an alternative school where she can get her GED. Oh Precious can get an education but just not in HER school. Don't you just love the liberal hypocrisy!

The next day (or a few weeks later can't really tell in this movie because the transitions are so choppy in this incoherent movie)Precious over her mother's objections (she wants her to be a welfare queen like her) signs up for Each One Teach One, an alternative school full of colorful clichd characters like Stand By Me, Welcome Back Kotter, Stand and Deliver, or whatever teen movie they were pulled from so she can work towards getting her GED. The class is led by Miss Blu Rain, an attractive light skinned woman and one of many light skinned/white saviors featured prominently in this movie. We're also introduced to Ms. Weiss, a haggard welfare caseworker, another light/white savior. While getting ready for her first day at her new school, Precious sees herself as a skinny blonde white girl. (A pitiful attempt at symbolizing her self-hate) Shawn wanted to see about getting a refund for his movie ticket but didn't want drama. So he endured another hour and a half of nonsense, including a visual of Precious and Mom in a scene from an Italian movie she's watching on PBS one night.

As her fellow students help Precious on the road towards literacy, and a healthy pregnancy, Problems pile up on ol' perpetual victim Precious. In between fights, guys dissing her and tripping her up, Her mom yelling at her for not cooking the pig feet and Macaroni and cheese right, Mary and Precious and her grandmother try to pull a fast one on welfare case worker which makes home visits. There we meet Mongol, Precious' daughter born with Down Syndrome that stays with her grandmother so she can keep the welfare duckets rolling in.
But wait a minute there's a BIG PLOTHOLE HERE. Wouldn't Mary want Precious to keep Mongol and take care of her herself instead of parceling her off to grammy? SSI (Supplemental Security Income) paid $400 a month for kids with disabilities back then. And SSI checks (paid for by Social Security, a branch of the Federal government) don't count towards income on welfare cases. Also, being a parent or guardian to kids with disabilities entitles parents (and relatives) to qualify for a Section 8 voucher (another federal program) and Section 8 housing. But Mary must be one of those illiterate Welfare queens who is SMART ENOUGH TO MANIPULATE CASE WORKERS for a STATE WELFARE CHECK but DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MILK THE FEDERAL SYSTEM FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.

Oh yeah, and welfare case workers didn't make home visits back then. I grew up on welfare back in the 80's as a kid in New York City and Case workers NEVER came for home visits (TOO DANGEROUS). Every visit to welfare offices in the 1980s was face-to-face at the HRA office (sat in many a waiting room during my childhood).

After the welfare mess is settled, the movie lightens up as precious steals some chicken, (Even though this would have been nigh impossible due to all the INCH THICK BULLETPROOF GLASS in eating establishments back then in the South Bronx and Harlem Plus customers placed their orders and paid FIRST.) Enjoying her snack, precious soon gets sick, and pukes, then off to class where the labor pains kick in. We meet Precious' dream man and the Sweathogs rally behind their classmate for some happy times.

After Abdul is born and Precious leaves the confines of the hospital and her light skinned dream man orderly, Mary welcomes her grandson home by slamming the baby to the floor and attacking Precious in a violent assault which climaxes with Mary throwing her color TV five stories down and missing her by an inch. Precious then breaks into Each one teach one with her baby and the movie starts falling apart. After a struggle with City services, (no help) Miss Rain allows the now homeless Precious to stay with her. It's here that we find out Miss Rain's a lesbian (not that this has any relevance to the plot, other than to reflect Sapphire's and Mr. Daniels sexual orientation.) Big deal.

Soon after Precious finds temporary shelter at a halfway house, we get some mumbo jumbo about workfare (which actually didn't start until 1988) and home health aide training for a minimum wage job that could stop Precious from achieving her GED, but none of this is developed or explored. This all reaches a climax as Precious is told in the halfway house by her mother that her daddy has died of AIDS and she should get tested. Soon after that we learn Precious has HIV as well. It's not soon after this that Precious reveals things to Miss Weiss (but not before stealing her case file, and reads what's in it with her each one teach one buddies.)

A few months later (Again, hard to tell due to the choppy transitions in this movie) in the social service office the empowered Precious who can now read and write at an eighth grade level has a confrontation with her mother where mom breaks down and confesses to all the abuse Precious has endured. Giving up once confronted by the White establishment, she hands her back Mongol and Precious goes off with her kids and we're supposed to believe she has hope for a brighter future.

I mean seriously WTF? WHERE'S THE HOPE? HIV IN 1987 is a DEATH SENTENCE. AZT which was STILL IN CLINICAL TRIALS hasn't been RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC YET. (It was released in 1990 for prescriptions). THE DIVISION OF AIDS SERVICES IN NYC HASN'T BEEN ESTABLISHED YET. In reality, due to the lack of financial resources, medical resources and medical technology back then, po' Precious would have GOTTEN FULL BLOWN AIDS AND DIED in 1988 or 1989 and her kids would wind up WARDS OF THE STATE or BACK WITH MARY WHO WOULD HAVE MILKED THE HELL OUT OF THOSE KIDS DISABILITES TO GET AL THE GOOD GOVERNMENT BENEFITS. And the most Precious would have gotten for all her hard work was a patch on the AIDS QUILT if Miss Rain could arrange it. (Remember that patchwork of thousands of AIDS victims unfurled every year in DC? It's currently in storage somewhere at the Smithsonian while the AIDS pandemic continues to claim victims worldwide)

Precious isn't a deep thought-provoking film. Director Lee Daniels uses exploitative images to deflect the viewer's attention from shallow storytelling and weak character development. The viewer's emotions are so caught up watching the graphic violence, profanity, sex, and twisted behavior of the characters that they have no idea they've been swindled by a con artist.

Precious isn't inspiring, nor does it uplift. It's an emotionally manipulative film that secretly masks a shameless cash grab by a consortium of self-hating uncle toms (Daniels, Sapphire, Fletcher) who with the aid of Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry seek to pander to white America and sell them the story about black life they're most comfortable with. This group of sell-outs laughed all the way to the bank at the expense of Black America; thanks to this film adding to the current trend of degrading images, a generation of brothers and sisters are now going to grow up thinking the behavior in this movie is the rule for black life and not the exception.

What's even more dangerous than the twisted visuals within Precious are the institutionally racist themes in the undertones of the message in this movie. Underneath the false messages of love and hope, is a message that African-Americans are inferior. In Precious ""White"" is right; Everyone who approves of Precious is either white or light skinned and without the validation and approval of these individuals she can't overcome the odds. Dark skinned black people are seen as inhuman, savage, and violent. They only speak in profanities and act like barbarians. Without the help of the white establishment (government services) to educate blacks there's no way for Precious to become ""civilized"" functional person. Only when whites love and approve of Precious her can she learn to love herself. What a load of CRAP.

Director Lee Daniels takes his self-hate to a new level of depravity surpassing the degrading images he presented to the public in Monster's Ball. In between his clumsy and inept visuals we have the same old racist stereotypes from the Antebellum South repackaged in a brand new box. We have the big illiterate who must be saved by the great white society, the fat welfare queen mammy who only speaks in a dialect of profanities, the anonymous faceless black male who is depicted as a monster but never developed as a full character, the nappy headed child who follows Precious around, and the light skinned and white heroes who teach our hero to love herself. Ideas about what black life should be like straight from the Ku Klux Klan from a black man more dangerous to African-Americans than the KKK, Skinheads, and the Aryan Nation combined. Seriously, if Daniels could get$60 million in ticket sales out of brothers and sisters and has the influence to win international acclaim for this patronizing, self-hating, anti-black propaganda, I shudder at what else he could be capable of.

What angers me more than this movie is what transpired behind the camera. Behind the scenes, Mr. Daniels showed a lack of integrity in promoting this film. Knowing that Precious would have African-Americans seen in a negative light, he still released it at Cannes anyway as a ""story of hope"". That shows malice of forethought and a depraved indifference to his brothers and sisters in the black community. I truly loathe this man and everything that he stands for. With every film he makes he sets the African-American community back a century. It doesn't matter that he's hurt the future of the black community with his movies, he's got his millions right now.

There's nothing ""Precious"" about this movie. It's pornography masquerading as art.

4106137,3,B003BEDAVS,"I read the book back in 1997 and remember not being very impressed. When I heard Oprah crowing about this movie before it came out, I was reminded of that long-forgotten book. I generally like Gabourney Sidibe when I have seen her in interviews and I was curious to see her in this film, since she had never acted in film before. In person, I think she is lovely and charming. In the film, she is downright ugly and hard to look at. I was also curious to see Mariah Carey so stripped down.
Precious is an interesting film and very well acted by everyone involved. That being said, in my opinion, its not the big awe-inspiring movie that everyone says it is. If you watch the interview with Sapphire, you see she is was a teacher who took bits and pieces of the lives of her students to make this film. And there might be the problem, the life Precious leads seems a little too over the top. Just how many hardships can one girl deal with? Obesity, poverty, incest, rape, disabled child, illiteracy, physical, mental and emotional abuse? There sure is a lot heaped on this one character. It's like a very strange, urban Cinderella story that she even manages to survive as well as she does.

I don't care what the setting and socioeconomic status is, that isn't a reason to love a movie.  A brain tumor followed by a long lost father out for revenge for my second-cousins failed pizza joint is just as ridiculous as what Precious goes through.

Brick by boring brick the main character's miserable life just gets worse and it's taxing.  There's no contrast between happy chords and sad ones, it's just an endless baseball bat being swung.  ""Think you feel bad for Precious?  Well how about this?""  I feel for Precious, but it's nothing but pity, and no one goes to a movie theater to feel pity.

4106141,4,B003BEDAVS,"For as many flaws as a film like `Precious' possesses, they all almost seem moot when you consider the emotional weight that this film carries.  You cannot help but walk away from `Precious' feeling a small part of your soul readjusted.  Like Miss Winfrey has mentioned on numerous occasions, `Precious' is a film that makes the audience aware of something they may have so often ignored; the fact that there are precious children the world over in need of something they are not receiving.

If this film doesn't leave you in tears, then I don't know what will.

`Precious' tells the story of Clarice `Precious Jones', a morbidly obese sixteen year old who is pregnant with her second child by her abusive father.  She is illiterate, reclusive, and continually berated and degraded by her mother Mary, a monstrous woman who blames Precious for her own dire circumstances.  When Precious is expelled from school for being pregnant she winds up at an alternative school where she meets Ms. Rain, a caring teacher who sees something in Precious that Precious doesn't see herself; hope.  While her circumstances won't fix themselves, and they won't go away overnight, Precious discovers within herself the will and the strength to make that first step towards something ultimately better for herself and for her two children.

There are holes within the storyline that make it hard at times to really wrap your head around.  Precious' life is horrific, but the way the film is edited at times dulls the atrocities.  I really think that all the faults here are left on director Lee Daniels' shoulders.  As much as Mo'Nique praised Lee up and down for his `vision', it is his vision that clouds out this films true potential.  The way he pollutes a seemingly vile situation with obnoxious fantasy sequences is rather off-putting.  The film becomes very heavy-handed, with properly placed symbols to tell us (the audience) how we are supposed to feel and what conclusions we are supposed to draw.  Instead of allowing the grit and the drama to speak for itself, Lee fell into the trap of over thinking everything.

But, where he fails the actors here truly shine.

All the hype surrounding the performances by Mo'Nique, Gabourey Sidibe and Mariah Carey are legit and deserved.  These three performances (in a sea of very well thought out and natural performances) are commanding and memorable; three of the best of the decade.  Sidibe (this is her first film) is heartbreakingly real as Precious.  You can feel her soul dividing as she tries to make sense of her dire straits.  She is alone and broken and desperately searching for a reason to survive.  Her eyes, sunken into her callous face, tell a story that is so reaching and so heartfelt one cannot help but be taken in entirely by it.  Mariah Carey, unrecognizable for sure, is also noteworthy here.  She has a few short scenes, but she truly maneuvers herself right into each frame, understanding how overwhelming her eventual understanding is going to be.  That final scene, where Mo'Nique sealed her Oscar win, gives us a better understanding of what knowledge can do to a person.  The way she latterly crumbles as she receives answers to questions she was required to ask; it was unnerving.

But, we should all take a moment to bask in the glory of Mo'Nique.  I'm not even going to get into the whole ""who knew she could pull THIS off?"" thing because this performance is too good to be degraded by that line of thinking.  Mo'Nique, quite frankly, delivers the best supporting performance of the decade.  This was, easily, my favorite Oscar win of the decade as well.  While one may rashly call her depiction of the monster Mary as generic and or clich&eacute;d, one only needs to watch the layers stripped away in that gut-wrenching final scene to see that there is nothing generic about this performance.  Mo'Nique manages to layer Mary with an awareness that comes from experience.  She understood this woman.  She made sure that when we saw her, we not only saw the evil things she was capable of, but we saw the pain and desperation that shaped and formed her.  We also so a little bit of Precious in her as well.  We never condone, but we begin to understand how Precious became Mary, and the unsettling truth behind that `circle of life' starts to kick in and we see the urgency in Precious taking reins and making her life better.

We see the future.

Like I mentioned, `Precious' is flawed.  The script has holes and the direction is not as refined as it needed to be.  Daniels was a tad green for this.  In the end, he delivered a stunning and memorable film, but he is the films weakest link.  The acting, the message, the atmosphere and authentic cinematography make this a truly noteworthy film, one that is definitely worth your time and attention.  Sadly, it doesn't connect all the dots.  Moments like the rape scene, the overlaying of bouncy music on black screens of abusive moaning, the carefully placed messages that are all too obvious (that `Two Women' reference itself was misplaced, misapplied and terribly distracting); they all take away (even if it is `ever so slightly') from the film for me.

I do want to mention that this film is an extreme.  Some take the `so true' statements too literally.  This film is not about an obese, abused, illiterate, poor black girl; this film is about a girl who was never truly loved.  That is the `so true' part.",1272844800,2,5429,4.757219251336898
4106142,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious, the sixteen-year-old very overweight title character is anything but precious to her mother, her father, her classmates, and street kids. Her mother, a mean-spirited, nasty piece of work has beaten most traces of self-worth and self-esteem out of her. She continually insults her and treats her like a slave. Precious is pregnant with a second child sired by her father.
 When she's sent to an alternative school in Harlem's Hotel Theresa, a caring young female teacher takes a personal interest in her as does her social worker to a lesser degree. Her new classmates grow to genuinely like her and stick with her when she has her second child.
 It's an intense, devastating, disturbing film. The scenes with her mother are truly shocking. Precious has fantasy scenes in which she escapes to a world of glamour, romance, and fame.
 As the film progresses, and as Precious learns to read and write, she develops a sense of her own worth. She becomes a proud mother, and she evolves into her own person. The scene in the social worker's office in which the mother tries to get Precious back is a tour de force in an Academy Award-winning role for the actress Mo'Nique.
 It is a brilliant piece of filmmaking with an air of street verisimilitude that is striking. Films have truly matured when you compare this very realistic and powerful film to the tame treatment of similar subjects in movies of the nineties.

The only commentary I have is that this Sapphire lady must really think highly of herself. I have to wonder if making sure ""Based on the novel Push by Sapphire"" would appear in every possible incarnation of the films' title was the deal breaker on Sapphire giving the story rights. The DVD special features also make sure that you, the viewer, know that Sapphire exists as an author and the she is indeed a real person who wrote the novel Push. Her name is Sapphire.

Not only that, even when people talk about it on TV they mention that it is based on the novel Push by Sapphire. For the life of me I cannot understand what is so ""precious"" about the novel Push by Sapphire for I highly doubt everyone keeps mentioning it constantly out of genuine affinity for the novel Push by Sapphire. I have never seen a ""based on the book"" line so lauded as this one. This movie is not called ""Precious."" This movie is called ""Precious based on the novel Push by Sapphire.""

4106145,5,B003BEDAVS,"There is nothing enjoyable about a story of an inner city, black girl who is obese, dark, homely, illiterate, and pregnant. Even her second pregnancy is also from her father raping her, and a mother who despises her for having ""taken her man from her.""

The title character, Precious, sees the only glimmer of hope in her life through fantasy and  daydreaming that her handsome white teacher is secretly in love with her or that she is a singing sensation and a dazzling celebrity adored by millions. This is her only shield against the sadistic impulsiveness of a maternal nightmare of a mother, whose one constant in life is beating and degrading her daughter while scheming to get more out of the welfare system. Precious' incestuous pregnancy turns into her salvation as she is helped into an alternative educational program where she learns that love is not what she received at home. She must also understand the reality that people can be nice to her who hardly know her. From these experiences, she begins to learn self-esteem one day at a time.

The movie tugs at you in two directions, as you cheer for someone to break free of the shackles of the welfare system and ignorance, while you develop utter contempt for the program through the behavior and ignorance of her subhuman mother. There is hope for one, but you get the feeling there is absolutely none for the other, and you end up not caring at all if there is.

This movie introduces us to the acting talent of Gabourey Sidibe who plays Precious. Her mother is played by Mo'Nique who has won critical acclaim for her role, which was all too convincing. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey are very effective in supporting roles.

It reminded me of the beatitude: ""Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs in the Kingdom of God."" If you choose to see ""Precious,"" and if you actually believe that there are people like her out there, you'll know that they deserve at least that much.",1272240000,2,1945,4.658892128279883
4106146,3,B003BEDAVS,"It's hard to know what to say about this movie and this review isn't going to be some in-depth analysis. There are plenty on those all over the web from every Doctor So-and-So you can imagine; this is just the thoughts of a common, garden variety movie-watcher.
The first thing that struck me about Precious was how well everyone played their role, even Mariah, though to be fair her part is barely more than sitting and nodding now and then, but she sat and nodded very believably!
The second thing I noticed was that the movie seemed to be incredibly racist and as a white American I thought, ""Maybe I've just been programmed to think that everything is racist because we live in an overly sensitive society where if you say anything about anyone who isn't white, you're a racist."" So I don't know. I'll try to explain.

*All the Other Reviews Have Already Spoiled the Entire Plot, So These Aren't Really Spoilers, but I'll Warn You Anyway*

FIrstly, I found it very odd that everyone in the movie seemed to have a decidedly ""ho-hum"" attitude towards the fact that Precious had two kids by her HIV-positive father. Her teacher, guidance counselor, whoever were all completely non-plussed by this news that should have been stomach-churning. It's like the movie was trying to say that it's completely normal and boring for poor black kids to be having their father's AIDS babies. Really? I don't know about that message...
And how many ""stereotypically poor black"" problems did Precious have to have? Did she really have to be on welfare, illiterate, a failure at school, pregnant, fat, the victim of child abuse as well as sexual abuse AND HIV-positive? Man! Really? They couldn't have picked, like, three? Too bad there wasn't time in the movie for her to join a gang and go to prison! Maybe in the sequel. All I'm saying is that even though I am white, I grew up in a very poor, predominantly black part of town and none of the kids I went to school with (most of whom were black) had half of the problems this movie suggests are normal for all poor black people. Certainly all of them could read.
And it is also somewhat interesting to note that all of the light-skinned, thin characters in the movie are intelligent, well-spoken, compassionate and educated while all the frumpy, dark-skinned characters are stupid, illiterate, helpless, full of self-loathing and completely broken in every conceivable way, not to mention only able to be saved by the light-skinned, thin characters who have everything together in their lives.
Is the film racist? I don't know. I'm not a thinker; I'm just a watcher. But I will say that I am not the type of person who sees racism in everything. I think the whole race thing in this country is completely blown way out of proportion, but this movie? It's hard to look at it and not see a lot of strange stuff going on. And I really cringe when I see people saying, ""This movie is so true!"" There's no way any of this can be ""so true"" for more than just the smallest, tiniest percentage of the US population. Like probably less than .0000001 percent of the US population has Precious' life and the way the movie brazenly hints that her life is a wide-spread epidemic that most if not all black people would identify with is not good, in my opinion.
And I do think the movie is really bad for all the racist people who are out there and who have already latched onto this as their proof that this is ""the way inner-city black people really are"". This in no way should be used as a guidebook to how any group of people ""really is"". Even though, of course I guess a lot of black people probably think that Napoleon Dynamite is how most white people really are. So it balances out, I guess. Ha.",1272067200,16,3728,4.562686567164179

4106148,3,B003BEDAVS,"Depressing and upsetting beyond belief but I kept watching hynotized.  Precious was very lucky in that someone found her to help her.  There are millions of girls like Precious suffering through very similar circumstances and very few get that ""certain someone"" to pull them through.  Some do it on their own and some need help but most do not get through it.  Society has too little resources to help those suffering; too much of our taxpayer moneys goes to foreign aid (maybe the US should file for foreign aid); two useless wars, corruption and waste in Congress and military to spend the money to look after our children.  This should be a wakeup call to all Americans to fight back at Congress to failing to help and protect the taxpayers.

4106154,5,B003BEDAVS,"I watched this once and found it too challenging to be very moving.  I then watched the bonus features on the DVD and was surprised to see that Gabby Sidibe was *quite* different from the character of Precious.  I hadn't planned to watch it again; but the next day I took a flight to Japan and found this movie available on the plane.  I planned to skip through it, but ended up watching it again.  Somehow, for some reason, as soon as the Labelle song kicked in at the end (""It Took a Long Time""), something inside me really started to stir (though I was already stirring from Precious' final breakdown in the classroom, when she revealed to her teacher what ""love"" had done to her).  But when ""For Precious girls everywhere"" popped up on the screen, I had quite a trembling lip!!  It was embarrassing on the plane, but I just could not help it.  There was something about the second viewing that made it so incredibly moving.  It also revealed many of the nuances of the film and the many characters (for better and for worse).  But that second viewing really did it for me.  It also became clear to me that the performance of Gabby Sidibe was far more massive than the size of Precious herself.  I was astonished to view the layers and the consistency in the performance; from how she walked and talked, and used her facial expressions to reveal the inner rumblings of her semi-literate mind.  I will now declare that this is probably the biggest Oscar oversight ever (but at least they nominated her).  Even if you call it a ""niche"" role for this actress (and suggests a limit to her versatility), that does not matter--she was brilliant and unforgettable.  It's a shame she didn't win, because it would have been the best underdog victory ever.  But that doesn't diminish the film or her incredible embodiment of this tragic yet inspired and inspiring character.

So my advice is to watch it again if it didn't move you.",1271116800,3,1925,4.5523255813953485
4106155,5,B003BEDAVS,"PRECIOUS BLU-RAY was a tough movie to watch. This is my second viewing, first was in the theater, but I knew that I had to have this treasure in my library.

The story takes place in 1987 in Harlem, NY and is about a morbidly obese teenager who is abused sexually, physically, and emotionally by her mother. They live in poverty and Claireece ""Precious"" Jones is semi-illiterate and pregnant for the second time by her biological father. She escapes into a world of fantasy to run from all the pain. After she gets sent to an alternative school and becomes inspired by a caring teacher and other girls who are in similar situations, her life goes from bad to worse--testing positive for HIV--but somehow ""Precious"" seems to find the strength to carry on.

In the end, the movie leaves viewers with a very subtle but hopeful note that might even be missed. I certainly didn't get it on first viewing thinking how can this be an uplifting movie? But it was. Knowing that the main character, despite being all that she's been through, is focused on herself and creating the life she wants is really an uplifting message. Easy to say but harder to do, Claireece doesn't focus on all the bad things that have happened to her at the hands of someone else. Instead, this young warrior channels her energy into bettering herself and taking care of her kids.

Gabourey Sidibe who portrays ""Claireece Precious Jones"" was remarkable in this emotionally challenging role. In the special features, Sidibe talks about how a friend recommended that she audition for the role to which she replied, ""but I'm not an actress."" You couldn't tell that by this tour-de-force performance.

And Mo'Nique deserved to win that Academy Award. She plays the abusive mother, ""Mary Jones,"" to the hilt! Although the role could have easily gone the way of camp (a la Faye Dunaway in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mommie-Dearest-Hollywood-Royalty-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000ERVJK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mommie Dearest (Hollywood Royalty/Special Collector's Edition)</a>), Mo'Nique gives just enough to bring her character close to the edge, without going overboard, and becoming a true monster. Who knew that this funny lady could convincingly portray a character who is 180-degrees from her usual happy and comedic roles.

As far as this movie reinforcing negative stereotypes, Mo'Nique responded eloquently when Barbara Walters asked the question and I'm paraphrasing, ""This could  anybody's story. It just so happens that the characters are black (in Precious), but poverty and abuse can happen to anyone."" So true.

Anyway, the PRECIOUS BLU-RAY has special features which are worth viewing as well:

Anyway, this movie might not be everyone's cup of tea but it has a powerful message behind it. It's not about stereotypes, either the reinforcement or creation of. It's a story about one person's will to overcome huge obstacles despite the odds. PRECIOUS is a story that we might not hear about too often, but one that isn't as uncommon as we'd like to think. And the beauty that lies in this dark movie is the message to all the ""precious"" boys and girls that you do matter, no matter what anyone tells you, you just have to see it for yourself.",1271116800,2,5091,5.40530303030303
4106156,5,B003BEDAVS,"I have not looked at this movie yet, but I have followed the stars on the award shows, the publicity.  I am sure that I will like it; that is why I purchased it.",1271116800,2,161,3.735294117647059
4106157,5,B003BEDAVS,"Gabourey Sidibe was robbed of the Oscar. I finally got to watch this movie and I have to say while I liked Meryl Streep in ""Julie and Julia"" and Sandra Bullock in ""The Blind Side"", neither role was as challenging or over such an emotional range as the load of this role of Precious was for this young actress and she handled it amazingly well.

""Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" was directed by Lee Daniels and stars Gabourey Sidibe as Precious, a young illiterate, overweight teen living in Harlem who is pregnant with her second child by her father and has been kicked out of school. She is given a second chance at life in an alternative school to work towards earning her G.E.D. It was no shock at all to see Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry as producers on this film.

Precious is doomed from the start by Mary played by Mo'Nique in the role that won her an Academy Award this year. This mother is so selfish that she can't even protect her daughter from being sexually abused and as she grows older, Mary grows jealous and resentful of Precious and abuses her physically and emotionally. Mo'Nique's Mary is frightening and shocking and in many sad ways, pathetic. Mo'Nique and Gabourey both ran the gauntlet of emotions in their roles and probably both should have won Academy Awards.

Gabourey Sidibe's Precious deals with serious hardships beyond what any person should ever have to face every single day between being mistreated by classmates, kids on the street, and her own family. Her weight issues result from a combination of starving when they don't have money to buy food and being forced to eat as punishment by Mary when she is told she doesn't cook the food right. Mary's complete dependence on her daughter and treatment of her as property creates a hold over Precious that is very difficult to break, especially when Precious wants to imagine Mary as a more caring mother in her dream world. What is most amazing to me with all the burdens of Precious' life with her education, her children, and her health is that she gets though the movie without ever giving up completely. She works really hard to learn to read and improve her situation and break out of the cycle of abuse. She goes through anger, bawling her eyes out despair, and the happiness that comes with having hope.

The teacher at the alternative school, Ms. Rain is played by Paula Patton. She is beautiful and handles the burden of helping these kids with grace and realism not often seen in typical movies about helping underprivileged kids. She genuinely cares and tries to connect without letting them walk all over her. This part of the story I've seen a ton of times with a teacher helping underprivileged kids but this is the best version I've seen since it didn't fall into cliches the way they usually do so easily. Mariah Carey takes on the best role I've ever seen from her by letting herself be completely real in appearance as a welfare worker, Mrs. Weiss. That kind of honesty combined with such a genuine performance really helped bring this movie together.

I really enjoyed the directing style and editing on this film. Precious often jumps into a fantasy of modeling or performing when she is in a difficult situation she wants to escape. I loved the way the film styles of glamor, photoshop, still images, and sparkle were split with gritty, dark, fluorescent lit reality.

Everything that could go wrong pretty much went wrong in this character's life so keep in mind when you consider watching this film that it is HEAVY in drama and sadness and a bad situation that keeps seeming to get worse. If you have a lot of trouble watching really down, depressing movies, you'll want to avoid this, but if you like crazy emotional rides than this is for you.

This story is often sad, shocking, depressing, uplifting, and always....precious.",1270944000,3,3852,4.689349112426036
4106158,5,B003BEDAVS,"Hype is often undeserved, especially when it comes to films. Add to the fact that PRECIOUS had Oprah attached to it and you might back off even further. But there's no need. This film, for all intents and purposes, is a phenomenon that deserves your attention.

Garnering two Academy Award wins and multiple, smaller award show prizes, Precious is ...well ...precious. The story could've gotten dark and downright depressing. I mean, we're talking about an abused, overweight teenager who's now into her second pregnancy (incestuous pregnancy, I might add), and one can see where you could surmise this to be a gloom-and-doom movie. It isn't. It's hopeful and surprisingly upbeat. And it's well-acted by a veritable group of unknowns.

In the prime role of Precious we have Gabby Sidibe, a first time wannabe actress who serendipitously found the casting location and locked in the role. She was the perfect choice, and gave off a sense of foreboding and hope throughout the film's length. Her flattened emotional state at home, where she's abused by her mother, contrasts perfectly with her life outside where she's trying to better herself against tremendous odds.

But if Gabby was perfect, the woman who played Mary (her Mother) was ...beyond perfection. Mo'Nique (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beerfest/dp/B000MEYFXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beerfest</a>) pulls in the performance of a lifetime. Uneducated, uninspired, confused, and ill-equipped to deal with just about anything, Mo'Nique played the part so beastfully that it was sometimes hard to watch what she might do next. She was the perfect manipulator.

Director Lee Daniels is one of those people who aren't afraid to steer directly into the path of controversy, and does so here with an able hand. You may have heard of his other successes; things like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-s-Ball/dp/B001EKGQX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster's Ball</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Woodsman/dp/B0007PID84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Woodsman</a>. No? Then I highly recommend you check them out if you enjoyed Precious.

I would warn parents, though, that Precious has a very appropriate R rating attached. The scenes of incest (although short-lived) are vivid, and there's liberal use of violence against infants and teens, as well as language that'd make a p0rn-star blush. But all of it is done in an appropriate context, never for shock value.

Precious deserves your attention. Not because it won an award, or because Oprah's attached to it. It deserves to be watched because there are too many kids out there going through this very same ordeal in social silence. Shame, despair, and anger eat at these kids. It's a miracle any of them come out the other side in a functional manner. Which is why Precious will inspire you.",1270944000,6,2949,5.814814814814815
4106159,5,B003BEDAVS,The video was deliver promptly. This is a thought provoking movie. I hope a lot of people see it. Thanks for your good service.,1270857600,2,127,4.333333333333333
4106160,4,B003BEDAVS,"This movie is too real to say the least. First of all, being a female who was raised in low income neigborhoods in the South, I can relate to everything Precious went through. Hell! Most of the girls I graduated High School with were in the exact same situation, and that's if they even made it before dropping out completely. So, this isn't exactly all that brand new, or all that thought-provoking to me. I guess because I've personally seen this time and time again. With that said, it is a sad movie, so you better bring a box of kleenex with you. It's certainly not for everybody either. Clarisse ""Precious"" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) is a 16-year-old obese black female. Precious is obese because her abusive mother force feeds her on the regular, but we only get a glimpse into that. Plus, Precious has one child (whom she's not raising) and another one on the way. On top of that, she has no education and she can't read or write. Furthermore, both her kids are products of rape by her father, and one of them has down's syndrome because of that fact. Mary (Mo'Nique) is her abusive mother (A well-deserved supporting actress winner). Mary hates Precious because she feels like she slept with her man and got pregnant for him on purpose. Nevermind, the fact she allowed her man to rape his own child while she watched, but Mary still blames Precious at any rate. This is sickening to say the least. However, they don't stop there, Precious constantly day dreams through-out the movie, but the day dreams are used as a coping mechanism or an escape from the horrible reality that is her life. Precious is constantly torn down by her mother physically and verbally because she's on welfare and does nothing with her life besides sitting around watching television all day and collecting checks for Precious and her child which she's not raising either (the grandmother is). Parent's telling lies, and making their children tell lies only to collect checks is another fact I know about all too well. Clearly, Mary wants the same for Precious, so she continues to make her feel crappy about herself so she won't do any better than what she's doing. If that's not enough, Precious was even being molested by her own mother. A fact which I think a lot of people missed about the movie too. I guess because the abuse by her father was so front and center, and the sexual abuse by her mother was very subtle. You really have to pay attention, or you'll miss it, and Mo'Nique actually admits to it in the end when she admits to needing someone to touch her and make her feel good. I think most people only thought she meant that it was because Precious ran her man off. If that isn't enough, there's a scene where Mary is masturbating and she asks Precious to come take care of her. That was sick! If you missed that part, either watch the movie again, or look at the special features on the DVD with the Director's interviews. At any rate, back to the overall plot, Precious has a guidance counselor who cares enough to tell her about the ""Each One Teach One"" program in order for her to better herself. In the program she meets other girls who are just like her. Granted, their story may not be hers, but she realizes she's not alone, and for the first time she's able to maintain friendships with her teacher and peers. That's something she's never had before, and frankly, I think that's the only time you see her with a smile on her fact through-out the movie (when she's interacting with these people). Through this program Precious develops a healthy mother-figure relationship with Blue Rain, her teacher and mentor from the program. It's always nice to know there's at least one person in the world that cares enough about you to help. Paula Patton, plays this role perfectly right along with Mo'Nique and Gabourey. With that said, it's through this program that Precious gains an inner strength and inspiration that she never knew she had. Therefore, she's able to make her situation better by learning to read and write, focus on being a better mother for her children, and facing all of her past demons, so she can close that chapter of her life and move on. Just when you see the glimmer of hope for her another bombshell is dropped. Precious' father has just died of HIV and she's HIV positive as well. HIV is another topic that seems taboo within the African American community, and that's made prevalent by her mother's ignorant response after being asked if she had contracted the virus as well. Again, this was another brave move. I'm glad this was addressed in the movie the way it was because there are far too many people that are scared to take a chance or even touch down on this topic. At any rate, Precious knows she still has to move on for her children if she ever hopes to be free of her mother completely. I guess one good thing that can be taken from this movie is that, no matter how bad your situation is you can always rise above it. With that said, I did expect more out of the ending, but overall, I liked this movie. It's the type of movie you have to be mentally prepared to watch because it is depressing.",1270771200,2,5139,4.538793103448276

4106162,5,B003BEDAVS,"PRECIOUS

I have always been a fan of Tyler Perry and any thing he puts his hands on, so of course I had to see this. I knew that this would be great when Perry was announced as a producer, he was the main reason I wanted to see this. Then I found out that Mo'Nique was starring in it, which made me really interested since she is a comedian. Needless to say I was not disappointed by this film at all, this is a very powerful film. I also must say that the hype this film received was well worth it, at least in my eyes.

The film follows the life of young Precious who is a mother trying to better her self in school and such. But her home life is not that grand with an abusive mother and her mother's boyfriend who rapes her. So we live her life with her feeling her pain being there for the downs but also for the highs. She finally meets some people who truly want to help her and her journey is an increasingly interesting if hard to watch one. From her mother to teachers there are people affecting her life for better or worse. This great film is based on the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire.

I must say that Gabourey Sidibe did a marvelous job as Precious and gave a truly award winning performance. She gives a truly hauntingly wonderful performance and you can see every emotion she pushes forth. I hope she has a wonderful career and continues to get roles like this, she will no doubt win an Oscar one day. Also the now Academy award winning actress Mo'Nique portrays one of the coldest and most interesting characters ever on film. She defiantly deserved the Oscar because this was so far off from her usual career. I am absolutely impressed by her and I hope she does more serious roles because she may win an Oscar for leading lady one day.

Also in the film I was actually impressed by Mariah Carey, I was not a big fan of her movie ""Glitter"" I think it was called. She did a really good job in this film as did singer Lenny Kravitz, I was impressed. Paula Patton as well did an excellent job in this film and really added another level to the film. It should also be said that all of the students in the film were really well cast as well. Geoffrey Fletcher did a great job turning this into a screenplay and director Lee Daniels did a marvelous job.

This is a very hard film to watch at times with a lot of bad things happening to this girl, but it is a great film. It has been a long time since a film like this has come out, glad to see things like this come out. Tyler Perry was great to get behind this thing and I am glad that I went to see it.

4106165,2,B003BEDAVS,"I must begin by saying that the performances by Monique and Gabby Sidibe are simply unprecedented.  I cannot even begin to understand why Gabby Sidibe did not win the Oscar for this.  My problem with the story and the film is that I am unable to wrap my mind around these events being even remotely possible.  Perhaps I am in denial that such horrors exist but I cannot fathom a life so filled with horror and darkness.  Are there truly such heathens among us?  Do mothers and fathers beat, sexually molest and rape their own flesh and blood?  This has nothing to do with race or religion or political profile; this bears directly down upon the soul and conscience of these human beings we share the planet with.  Do they truly exist?  Are there young men and women living lives as portrayed in this film?

All of the horror movies combined cannot hold a candle to the absolute terror that is this film.  These are the things that truly do go bump in the night.  These are the monsters under the bed; the witches in the closet; the vampires that lurk in the shadows.

I would not recommend this movie.  It is a disturbing spear that penetrates the heart and murders the spirit.  Do we turn our backs on such occurrences?  Absolutely not.  Rather than spend millions on movies that depict these truths, we should focus our energy on whatever it is that needs to be done to move toward the rescue of our most precious natural resources: our children.  I read books and watch movies to be entertained.  I was not at all entertained by this film.  It was a stark jolt of reality that left me filled with despair, regret and heartbreak.

4106166,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious by Sapphire is a biographical fiction, based on a fourteen year old black teen, Pregnant for her second time by her father and fearing for her life. Throughout her life she has been sexually, physically and mentally abuse by both her mother and father. Her first was a child born with down syndrome, and was given away by her abusive mother to Precious grandmother. Throughout the story Precious is pregnant with the second child.
The novel Precious by poet and author Sapphire is a disturbing look at the life of an illiterate victim. The author uses poor grammar to portray Precious accent, and poor communication skills. Sapphire really dramatically brings the book to life by using discrete, violent, explicit language. Themes that are applied in the novel are achievement, determination, faith and strength. Precious uses all of these by pushing herself to graduate school and by pursuing her dreams of moving away from her mother with her children.
 When Precious gets the opportunity to go to an alternative school she meets Ms. Rain who does everything in her power to help Precious pursue her goals. A passage that had strong imagery was when Precious explained the time when she was seven years old and her father continued to have sexual intercourse with her.

4106169,5,B003BEDAVS,"I don't often get emotional watching movies.  However, while watching ""Precious: Based On the Novel Push by Sapphire,"" there was just no way for me not to.  This film grips your heart and does not let go - until long after the closing credits.

You can read what the film is about in the description, so I won't repeat the plot here.  I will say this: the acting, direction, screenplay adaptation, soundtrack, and overall production all set a platinum standard of excellence in film-making.  To say that acting newcomer Gaborey Sidibe did a great job in her first professional acting role would be an understatement.  She knocked it out of the ballpark!  I will be very upset if I don't see her in future films, as she has definitely shown that she has the chops to succeed as an actress.

Comedienne Mo'Nique... well... what can you say about her, except that her performance left me with emotional blisters!?  I absolutely love seeing performers known for one particular zenre (in her case, comedy) take a chance and ""flip the script"" on the audience by not only taking on a role that we're not used to seeing them in, but milk it for all its worth.  This is exactly what Mo'Nique does in this film; her performance is brilliant, monstrous and downright frightening all at the same time.  She didn't play it safe in this role as Mary, the welfare mother from Hell.  She went for broke and it paid off in spades.  No wonder she scooped up every ""Best Supporting Actress"" award in the world during the 2009 awards season leading up to her win at the Oscars.  She deserved every one of them.

The supporting cast (including Mariah Carey, Paula Patton, Lenny Kravits, Sherri Sheppard) all beautifully contribute to one of the most heart-wrenching and heart-warming stories ever put on the silver screen.  ""Precious"" is high-quality film-making at its finest.",1270080000,5,1856,4.753125
4106170,5,B003BEDAVS,"Once a movie or book has garnered a significant number of reviews I always read the one and two star reviews to try and assess why a minority of people feel so strongly that a work is so overwhelmingly bad as to merit the ultimate negative reviews.  With Precious there is an interesting trend (or trendlet?)of dissing the movie for being depressing.  This should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who's read or heard anything about it before seeing it.  Of course it is!  And avoiding being reminded of the more distressing aspects of life does nothing to dispel the realities for all too many people.  Precious is not, contrary to one negative review, thoroughly unlikable, rather she is shielded and guarded by a fantasy life from the worst moments of inescapable misery and horror.  She lives entirely in her fantasies as an escape, dissociating herself from that which she cannot literally remove herself.  She has no friends, no adequate defenses, and only the hope to be found in her technicolored rock star/supermodel dreams.

I find it interesting that the negative reviews completely avoid the obvious: Precious is a film about the ultimate stereotypical Welfare denizens, poor, Black, and multi-generational losers mooching professionally off the system and wanting nothing else.  There is a significant segment of our society who would clasp this film to its collective bosom whilst chanting ""See?  Like them!""  Veddy in-te-res-tinck.  But the film is more than that; it is a powerful example of the impact a little attention and effort to reach out to those who hurt can accomplish.  No, the movie doesn't end with flowers and rainbows everywhere, it ends with a wan ray of hope shining in the dark.  In the end, Precious escapes her hopeless prison by deciding she will define herself.  One can only hope she manages to do so, against all odds.",1269993600,5,1860,4.916666666666667
4106171,4,B003BEDAVS,"As a teacher I know of many kids similar to this predicament but this is the story of one set in Harlem circa 1987 and about an extremely obese 16 year old Clarice Precious Jones, who has below average reading levels and has severe problems of self worthiness, she has been abused by her father since she was three. She reads at about first grade level and when she is found to be pregnant by her father for a second time, the counselor arranges for her to enroll at the alternative high school. Although she has a desire to learn, her mother strongly discourages her attempts to educate herself and insists that she get welfare. The movie chronicles the growth of Precious in to a woman who is ready to take responsibility and even head for college. If you notice the words at the beginning of the film are misspelled but at the end they are spelt correctly which in my opinion indicates that not only her literacy skills have improved but the world has also begun to make more sense.
The center of the film is the abusive relationship that Precious has with her mother and her ultimate solace in the classroom under the watchful, caring and kind eye of her teacher, Blu rain played by Paula Patton.  Gabourey Sidibe is wonderfully cast in the title role and gives us a remarkable performance. Mariah Carey is Mrs. Weiss, in an important role as a welfare worker. I thought that anyone could have played the role but to see Mariah without makeup is a revelation in itself. Lenny Kravitz is an assistant nurse and he is suitable in the brief role. However the home run is hit by Mo' nique who gives us a great performance as the evil welfare mom, in a scene that makes you both hate her and feel sad for her,  she accuses Precious for stealing her man when she learns that she is pregnant with her second son. She is also excellent as the depressed withdrawn person who lives on welfare and only steps out to play lottery. Just watch her in the scene with Mariah Carey and Precious in the movie's final moments.
Although this movie is depressing enough it is in the end optimistic and offers hope to the many Precious's out there. I gave it four stars. 3/31/10",1269993600,,2160,4.452020202020202

4106173,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious is my favorite film although I liked many of the films this year.

The subject matter in Precious is unattractive but director Lee Daniels doesn't show full atrocities many are implied in scenes usually followed by the imagination of Precious.  Which takes her to another place to better deal with the violent incident.  And this gives in site into who Precious is and provides hope throughout the film.

In one scene Precious is at home and dressed for school checks herself out in a mirror.  Her reflection is of a slim, white, blond teenager.  Precious touches up her hair the blond teenager in the mirror does the same then Precious leaves the room for school.  The scene reminded me of any of us feeling inadequate and wanting to be what society views as beautiful.

And Precious doesn't feel sorry for herself.  One scene she talks about crying and feeling stupid the day before then she adds something like ""forget that, that's why God or whoever makes new days.""

Precious is more than strong she is courageous in this film.  And gradually throughout the film in spite of spiraling events in her life Precious gains self esteem, learning and encouragement from the love and caring of her teacher, a nurse and classmates.  Something she never got at home.  Which makes you wonder, how can you not love Precious....... Her resiliency and natural intelligence is hers and she handles every ugly incident life throws her way with dignity.

Unknown college psychology major, Gabourey Sidibe carries this whole film.  I was captivated by this actress and wanted to see where she would take me as she portrayed Precious.  All the actors in the film were outstanding.

Precious is not for you if you don't care for all of humanity.  And if you assume people that look similar are all alike.  Also some subjects in the film may turn some away due to its truthfulness like headlines in the daily newspaper, ""Mother drowns children"", ""Father rapes child"".

4106174,5,B003BEDAVS,"The realism of the movie Precious is mind-blowing. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, it was the very first time I EVER got emotional watching something that was supposed to be fiction.

Mo'Nique definitely deserved the Oscar that she won with her compelling performance of an abusive mother (Mary). Words cannot accurately describe how sadistic and sinister of a mother she was. One of the most conniving, manipulative and vicious on-screen portrayals of an abusive mother I've ever seen on-screen. Not only did she become her character, but she also added an authenticity to Mary...

Gabourey Sibide also deserved all of the accolades that she received as a result of her portrayal of a sexually, mentally and physically abused child. It's unfathomable how this movie is her first film. She became her character (Clarisse Jones) like a veteran. I've never seen a new-comer command her part the way that she did...

Paula Patton played a very compelling role as a teacher at an alternative school who takes a special liking to Precious and shows Precious love (in spite of how Precious feels about herself). She also had an interesting lesbian relationship that actually meshed really well with the movie.

Mariah Carey was absolutely unrecognizable! As I was watching the movie, I kept thinking to myself how familiar she looked. It took me a few minutes before I realized that she was the social worker. Mariah actually re-invented herself...

Even Lenny Kravitz made an insignificant role as a male nurse stand out. It's hard not to notice Lenny, but he too had a very meaningful role in Precious...

Everyone who was a part of this film turned an Urban Fiction story into some unfortunate family's life story. Precious deserves at least 5 Stars... A definite must-see..

My only complaint with Precious was how it ended; it was very abrupt and sort of open-ended leaving me to wonder what happened with a few minor details that weren't addressed before the end of the movie. I'll let you be the judge though...

Also due to the graphic language and adult situations, Precious is definitely not kid-friendly to watch...",1269907200,3,2133,4.93854748603352

4106176,5,B003BEDAVS,"Clarisse ""Precious"" Jones's life is bleak and cruel. Precious, who lives with her abusive mother, is obese, struggles in school, and is pregnant for the second time by her father. Her first baby suffers from Downs Syndrome and Precious rarely sees her. When Precious is moved to an alternative school due to her pregnancy, her mother pressures her to get on welfare, but Precious is determined to make a better life for herself and her child. In the alternative school, Precious blooms under the guidance of a caring teacher and for the first time has friends in her life. Although others pressure Precious to give up her baby for adoption, she is determined to raise him and care for him, and her stubborn determination to hold on to her child as well as educate herself so she can be a better parent to him is heartwarming.

The acting in the movie is truly exceptional. Mo'Nique plays Precious's mother, a violent woman who feels no qualms about hitting her daughter or telling her she wishes she had had an abortion. Although she witnessed her boyfriend abusing Precious, she blames Precious for the abuse and his leaving her. The scene when Precious finally stands up to her mother is so powerful and so realistic, it brought tears to my eyes.

4106177,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious is a sucker punch of a film but with its silver lining very well defined.  Claireece Precious Jones lives a life that Dante could have included in his Inferno.  Perhaps label it the 12th circle of hell.  It's 1987 Harlem, Precious is 16, illiterate, pregnant for the second time from her father, (the first one having been born with Down Syndrome) and has the joy of living with her welfare dependant mother who just happens to be the walking embodiment of hatred and cruelty.  How a mother could be so vile to her own child is beyond anything that approaches comprehensibility.  All Precious has in her life, is an innate sense of worth and penchant for fantasy, both of which manage to sustain her in a world that has, seemingly and indifferently, turned its back on her.  Having been kicked out of her high school due to her pregnancy,  she registers in an alternative school and with the love and support of her teacher (a wonderful Paula  Patton) and a myriad assortment of other teenage misfits, Precious starts to slowly see the light at the end of the tunnel; however, shortly after giving birth to her second child and setting about establishing her independence from her poisonous mother, she is  yanked down once again, after the untimely death of her father reveals yet another layer of his selfishness and betrayal.  Throughout this life extinguishing ordeal, she has the support of a caring social worker (an unrecognizable and extremely effective Mariah Carey) who believes in Precious and helps her to help herself.  The aforementioned may lead one to believe that this is a depressing film but it really isn't.  You see, Precious has been victimized her whole life but she's no one's victim.  She's a fighter, a survivor and a dreamer and she will not allow anyone to take from her what she values most:  Her sense of self.  No doubt, it's a tough movie to watch but the rewards are more than generous.  Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique turn in performances that are as heartfelt and honest as they are unflinching and, at times, stomach churning.  Frankly, I was hoping for an upset in the Best Actress category at the Oscars.  There was no doubt in my mind that Mo'Nique had this one wrapped up.  It took but one scene to lock it in and those who have seen the film know which scene I'm referring to.  She asks, almost imploringly, pathetically in her attempt to justify her vitriol, ""Who was going to love me?""  For once, she's vulnerable but it's not enough.  It's never enough.  The sense of pity and repugnance that moment yields is one of only a handful that I remember experiencing in a lifetime of serious film watching.  It's truly extraordinary.  From a technical/production standpoint, I couldn't find fault.

4106181,5,B003BEDAVS,"What tenacious intensity and brilliance the cast of Lee Daniels' new film, Precious, has. From the powerful, terrifyingly believable performance of comedian and actress Mo'Nique, to the heart-breaking portrayal of the title character by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe, this movie is a gritty, intimate portrait of a young girl who has never had hope in her life, just her dreams and fantasies to comfort her.

Based on the novel Push by Sapphire, Precious tells the story of Clarice Precious Jones, a deeply disturbed and broken down young girl who cannot read or write, and who has one baby girl, and another on the way. Both children were conceived from her father raping her. Precious is fat, her clothes don't fit her right, and she is constantly mocked and cruelly treated by kids at school, and by her mother, Mary (Mo'Nique), at home. Rather than blaming her boyfriend for raping her daughter and getting angry with him, Mary blames Precious for it all, accusing her of both stealing him, and chasing him away.

There is a great deal of despair in Precious' life, and the abuse that she receives at home is by far the most difficult and painful thing to watch in this movie because of how convincing and believable these actors are. However, along with the despair, there is also much inspiration and hope. Ms. Blue Rain (Paula Patton), Precious' alternative school teacher, Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), a social worker, and even a nurse (Lenny Kravitz) are all people that Precious needs in her life. It is these people who don't simply dismiss Precious as a hopeless girl surviving off of welfare checks. They all see the pain that is rotting inside of her, decaying her soul, and when in her darkest hour, these people reach out a helping hand.

Her mother is not necessarily evil, but rather someone who has been beaten down emotionally, physically, and mentally. She is a hypocrite, however, who has taken that pain and suffering and turned it on her own daughter, instead of channeling it in a more positive way and seeking guidance, which is what Precious is pushed to do. Perhaps that is why her mother never did seek help: no one ever pushed her to do so.

Patton, Kravitz, and Carey all do wonderful work in this film. I would have been skeptical about the casting of Carey and Kravitz maybe a few years ago, but there have been tremendous dramatic turns from music stars in recent years-such as Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges in Crash, and Mos Def in 16 Blocks-that has made me rethink this skepticism. These two continue this trend, and I was thoroughly moved by both of them.

Mo'Nique, Sidibe, Patton, and Carey would have all been suitable oscar contenders, and Mo'Nique earned every inch of her award. The style of the movie, in all respects, is phenomenal. We care about this young girl, and the more she has to push herself to grow, the more we feel for her. It is remarkable how Sidibe has accomplished something so profound here, this being her first acting job. She is electrifying in this movie, and if she should choose to continue acting, I would hope that she keeps every ounce of charisma that she displays here.",1269216000,3,3130,4.7357798165137615
4106182,5,B003BEDAVS,"The charming Gabourey Sidibe delivers an inspired and uplifting performance in her first film role as the lead in the much discussed ""Precious"". The role celebrates the formidable inner strength of character within Precious allowing her to survive the daily avalanche of brutal abuse by her chillingly damaged,rabid-pit-bull of a mother. A mother who makes Mommie Dearest look like Mother Teresa...
Miss Sidibe,if anyone, deserved the 2010 Oscar for best actress...perhaps...perhaps for daring to upstage Mo'Nique's camp performance with subtle, understated mesmerizing acting!
Mr. John Waters' should write a potty-mouthed film just for Mo'Nique,full of ironic venom. Revisiting his  tawdry roots could be very funny and BRILLIANT!
The sophisticated cinematography, editing and juxtapositioning of fantasy sequences in the midst of scenes of horrific child abuse makes the film actually bearable to watch. The raw reality of poverty, lack of education, denial and escapism is presented unflinchingly....and believably. Just don't expect the genteel world of ""Architectural Digest"".LOL.
Mo'Nique's one-note performance as the mother, unfortunately, sounds like much of her tedious and tired stand up comedy routines where unrelenting profanity and hostility takes center rage...I mean stage. ""Liberating"":maybe...mind-numbing:most definitely!
The BIG question is, will the unstoppable Miss Mo' ever be allowed to speak without harsh expletives in her professional work?
As a much, much welcome relief,the classically beautiful, elegant and sensitive Paula Patton plays the kind hearted Special-Ed teacher, Miss Rain (a traditionally feminine lesbian) very effectively....and in doing so, provides the much needed support, shelter, affection and encouragement that Precious is starving for...and pushes her to take charge and rise above her hopelessly desperate circumstances.",1269216000,3,1875,6.1022727272727275

But this movie really does something fantastic - it takes your mind and carefully brings you into a deeper thicket of humanness. I don't even remember how it happened.  But it really did and it is an unexpected and unusual surprise.

Oh, and if you know anyone who has any ""mom"" issues, this movie will touch that base.

4106185,5,B003BEDAVS,"The utmost value of an education is the story within the story that is Precious. Without the teacher in this story, Precious most likely would have gone the way of her mother (Precious reveals her volatile nature a number of times in the film). A common conception is that daughters become their mothers, sons their fathers. A girl's childhood is imprinted by her mother in creating a blueprint of herself. Education in this story--directly charged by one teacher--changed this story to a different one--that of renewal, revision, revival, redemption. Re means again. New again. Changed (revised), redeemed or salvaged or blood bought--in this case through the intellectual and emotional blood of the teacher.

By this time the story of Precious, if not viewed first person, is known through print, video news, or word of mouth. I have nothing new to add to that and concur with all the critical acclaim. However, it's the story inside the story that makes ""Precious,"" both the film and the story work. A vibrant, fairly young teacher, Blu Rain, finds herself, having chosen the Reach One, Teach One program as her bailiwick, facing a new class in this alternative program for hard-to-teach/reach teenage girls. One girl is unusually repressed, a big, hulking girl trying to shrink herself both physically and emotionally.

The viewer already knows this girl--Clareece Precious Jones--as physically and emotionally abused by her mother and sexually by her father. In fact, the story opens with the revelation that Precious is pregnant a second time by her father. Precious is virtually illiterate and has been passed on by teachers obviously grateful to Precious because she causes no classroom problems. Her mother tells her she is too stupid to learn as is her mongoloid daughter. Mo'Nique as the mother definitely earned her Academy Award as Supporting Actress in a viscerally biting performance.

So into the alternative program Precious goes, despite her mother's demand that Precious apply for welfare. That's where this young teacher makes a difference. She has her girls write every day, knowing the rewards and advantages of writing. Much later when Precious announces really bad news and screams that she doesn't want to write, this teacher insists: ""Write it down!"" ""Write about it!"" Why be so insistent?

That's where I come in. As a high school English teacher who knows first hand about writing, I can say what writing does. In no particular order:

1. It clarifies thinking, which can be muddled without the direction of writing. Thoughts on paper become more concrete and accessible and easier to organize. It opens doors to new thought.

2. It can aid in decision making.  How often does a therapist advise a patient to write down pros and cons of a situation? Seeing them in print clarifies (as stated in number one) but also defines.

3. It is purgative. Studies show that prison inmates who keep journals can purge themselves of negative and hostile thinking. I'm sure the teacher had this in mind in insisting, almost demanding that Precious write at that moment.

4. It is reflective. How can one grow and go forward without reflecting on where one has been?

5. It opens a path into a more creative direction, including first considering life's possibilities, then pursuing them. The term is FLOW.

Other studies show that abused children can succeed beyond wildest expectations, but at what price? Precious has consciously made the decision to be more than she is, doggedly pursues this goal despite the horrors of her life, and eventually breaks ties with the past, the absolutely wisest choice for her own growth of mental acuity and emotional strength.

Behind all of Precious's resolve and pursuit stands Blu Rain as the catalyst, the initiating force of the story inside the story that is Precious. A cheer for all dedicated teachers everywhere! And may Precious reach her potential!",1268870400,2,3912,5.066874027993779

4106187,5,B003BEDAVS,"""Shadowboxer"" director Lee Daniels deserves every award and honor that Hollywood and critics around the world can bestow on him for his electrifying African-American social problem film ""Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" that casts newcomer Gabourey Sidibe as the troubled heroine. This R-rated, 110-minute urban nightmare probably could not have been made without the help of both Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry. You can just imagine what derisive comments greeted this venture when the filmmakers pitched their idea about a theatrical release chronicling a year in the life of an abused obese soul sister. Who would want to suffer through a thoroughly depressing, often offensive movie about a big fat loser trapped in the ghetto? Indeed, when you watch the trailer for this film, you want to suppress a laugh because everything is so hideously horrifying about this poor girl's hopeless existence. She puts up with an incredibly monstrous mother who treats her as if she were own personal slave. Nevertheless, despite its uncompromising subject matter, ""Precious"" qualifies as an inspiring film that doesn't rely on sugar-coating and a happy ending. Sapphire wrote her 1996 novel ""Push"" in first-person and adopted a rough, stylized dialect to enhance its verisimilitude. Reportedly, ""Push"" was Sapphire's homage to ""The Color Purple."" Ostensibly, Lionsgate--the company that is distributing the Daniels film changed the title from ""Push"" to ""Precious"" to avoid any confusion between this powerful film and the lackluster Chris Evans & Dakota Fanning science fiction epic ""Push"" (2009).

""Precious"" depicts in semi-documentary fashion the plight of an illiterate, grotesquely overweight 16-year old Harlem girl poised to give birth to her second child. Ironically, Claireece 'Precious' Jones (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) has never had a boyfriend. Incidentally, her first child is a four-year-old girl afflicted with Down's syndrome, and her tyrannical, potty-mouthed mother Mary (Mo'Nique of ""Soul Plane"") despises the adolescent and forces her mother to keep her. At school, Precious' classmates ridicule her Buddha-like physique, but she maintains a stoic imperturbability and ignores their insults. Meanwhile, Mary lets her incestuous boyfriend (Rodney Bear Jackson) rape her daughter while she stands in the background and observes this act of child abuse. No, there is no nudity in these harrowing scenes, but the content may be disturbing enough to alienate some audiences. In fact, Mary has allowed her out-of-control boyfriend to take advantage of Precious since the girl was three years old and mother and daughter shared the same bed with him. As the film unspools, Precious finds herself expelled from her high school because she is pregnant. The conscientious school principal arranges for Precious to attend an alternative school called Each One Teach One where drop-outs go to earn their GED. Precious learns to read and write under the tutelage of her instructor Blu Rain (Paula Patton of ""Hitch""), a dedicated but kind teacher who inspires Precious to keep a journal about her life. Meantime, Mary never misses an opportunity to insult, torment, and batter her obsequious daughter. Precious takes everything that her wicked mother can dish out until she comes home with her infant son Abdul. Mary knocks Abdul out of her arms and begins to batter her daughter. Precious fights back, seizes her baby and flees. Precious is in such a hurry that she loses her footing and topples down the stairs. Meanwhile, mom lugs her portable TV outside and hurls it at her daughter. The television barely misses Precious and crashes into a million pieces. Eventually, after Precious has her son, she decides to left her impossible mother and goes to stay with Ms. Patton. If all this drama weren't enough, Precious learns from her mother that her father had contracted the AIDS virus. A brave social worker Mrs. Weiss (pop singer Mariah Carey deglamorized without make-up) helps Precious escape the abuse that her villainous mother doles out with a vengeance. Sure, this sounds as depressing as you can imagine because there is nothing far-fetched about it.

""Precious"" ranks as a compelling as well as gripping cinematic experience with kitchen-sink realism about intolerance. What takes ""Precious"" to another level of celluloid sophistication is that Daniels takes us into the head of his protagonist, and we see everything from Precious' perspective in terms of her dreams and aspirations. She yearns to have a light-skinned boyfriend, beautiful clothes, and fame. Daniels delivers some incredibly surreal moments. We see Precious' thoughts turned into a movie that she is watching on television, Vittorio De Sica's ""Two Women,"" about Italian refugees during World War II that adds another dimension to her wretched predicament. Apparently, Mary forced Precious to eat food even when she was not hungry. This abuse is alluded to in the movie as Precious sees it from her warped perspective. Another extraordinary scene occurs in Precious' bedroom as she is applying her make-up. The image reflected in the mirror is of a blond poster girl that occupies space on her wall. This ironic poster captures the escapist fantasies that fuel Precious's life and she falls back on to evade the constant harassment of her mother and her ugly physical environment. Musician Lenny Kravitz has a supporting role as Nurse John who takes care of Precious while she is in the hospital. Movies about social workers and the victims of parental abuse will never be the same after ""Precious."" Who would have thought that such an unrelentingly dire story with a first-time would have the sledgehammer impact that it delivers!",1268784000,4,5721,5.306504961411246

I also have to wonder that if this film was made by white film-makers, it would be called racist.  Mo'nique was good, but is that the kind of character that anyone wants to play?  I mean, the movies biggest flaw is that with all the negative actions and stereotypes on screen, there is no real call-to-arms to change things.

4106189,5,B003BEDAVS,"PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL ""PUSH"" BY SAPPHIRE is one of those rare films that is a true gem of filmmaking.  I'm not just talking about the story, even though that is a particular strength: this film takes you to the very depths of hell, and manages to pull you from the muck and mire and doesn't quite lift you back out, but at least brings you up enough so you can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Precious Jones's journey from abused victim of incest to self-empowered mother is evocative and inspiring in all the right ways.

No, what I'm talking about is the overall art behind the film.  Gabourey Sidibe deserved the Oscar that Sandra Bullock whisked away (I think even Bullock was aware Sidibe should've gotten it); Mo'Nique got her Oscar, and deservedly so.  Both give fearless performances; they both actually take risks here, real genuine risk-taking that we don't see much in Hollywood anymore.  The supporting cast is likewise stellar: Paula Patton as a hard-edged but caring teacher; Mariah Carey (actually acting!) as a similarly strong social worker; even Lenny Kravitz as a sympathetic (and thankfully not shirtless) nurse.  Behind the actors is the script by Goeffrey Fletcher (based on Sapphire's novel ""Push"", in case you hadn't figured that out), and Lee Daniels's strong, sturdy, confident directing.

PRECIOUS (we'll dispense with that horribly long title) is a true work of cinematic art.  It's deep and powerful; it'll take you places, and not necessarily places you want to go.  Be ready to feel uncomfortable; be ready to walk away feeling dirty and soiled.  But there is hope, there is redemption somewhere; PRECIOUS forces you to find it yourself, but it at least starts you on the right path.  Watch this film.

4106192,4,B003BEDAVS,"Set in Harlem in 1987, ""Precious: Based on the Novel `Push` By Sapphire"" takes us to a world that most of us will be fortunate enough never to have to experience first hand - one where troubled adults produce even more troubled offspring, where individuals, ignored and abandoned by the society at large, struggle to survive in a self-perpetuating cycle of hopelessness and despair.  Just by the mere act of taking us to this world, the movie at least forces us to acknowledge its existence.  Whether or not we choose to do something about it is a whole other matter.

This harrowing drama, adapted by Geoffrey S. Fletcher, focuses on Claireese `Precious` Jones, an introverted, inarticulate and overweight 16-year-old victim of incest who is already pregnant with her second child from the father who regularly rapes her.  Though filled with dreams of a better life, Precious is caught in a vortex of misery from which there appears to be no escape: grinding poverty, a mother who abuses her (physically, sexually, psychologically), a school system that is failing her, and peers who harass and torment her on a regular basis (though she is certainly streetwise and physically imposing enough to give back as good as she gets).  Small wonder, then, that the youngster has no friends and zero sense of self-worth.  Only in voiceover recitation is Precious able to articulate her innermost thoughts and feelings and, even then, those reflections are strictly limited to the vocabulary and reference-points familiar to her from the harshly circumscribed environment in which she lives.  Yet, those reflections are no less heartfelt and sincere for that.  Even the dreams she has for her own life - of becoming a world-famous singer and dancer - are fueled by the cliches of the pop culture world that surrounds her and, hence, are in no way realistic or achievable for a girl in her situation.

The small glimmers of realistic hope that do find their way into Precious' life come in the form of a remedial reading program she enrolls in after her pregnancy forces her to leave her current school, and the caring and compassionate teacher who is the first to unlock some of the potential trapped deep inside the young girl's damaged psyche.  Precious is convinced that no one loves her - worse, that, since every form of love that has come her way up to this point in her life has been hurtful and damaging, that love itself must, by definition, be hurtful and damaging as well.

Directed with unhurried restraint by Lee Daniels, ""Precious"" is a showcase for some amazing female performers who, in the short time we spend with them, make an indelible mark on our spirits and hearts.  Paula Patton is very good as the attractive lesbian teacher who reaches out a hand of friendship to the troubled girl, as is a de-glamorized Mariah Carey playing Precious' social worker, Ms. Weiss.  But it is Gabourey Sidibe, in her film debut as Precious, and comedienne Mo'Nique (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this role), as the monstrous mother from hell, who create unforgettable portraits - the first, of a girl who holds everything she feels inside herself almost to the point of emotional implosion, and the second, of a woman who can`t react to the world around her except through an uncontrollable paroxysm of anger and rage.

The movie occasionally interrupts the grim narrative with fantasy sequences that reflect Precious' desires to escape from reality - including, most bizarrely, one in which she imagines herself as a character in the Sophia Loren movie ""Two Women,"" of all things.  Random but definitely interesting.

Uncompromising in its realism, yet still daring to hope, ""Precious"" the movie perfectly reflects Precious the person.",1268611200,,3747,4.952153110047847

In particular the behaviors, language and interactions both between students and with staff, were fairly spot on. Also, having written IEPs that included home visits I found similar situations where a TV was the guardian and institutional supplied income was a manipulated and important financial source for families. The only student demographic that was not represented but comprises a large percentage of this population are the high testing and low performance students (as opposed to the low testing, low performance students shown in the movie) that I've encountered. This large population is street smart and surprisingly mature in ways that they find standard textbook academics as simply too boring and not immediately relevant so they pursue risky behaviors that result in them being removed from the traditional classroom.

4106197,5,B003BEDAVS,"On the surface ""Precious"" could be another sad movie about tragic circumstances of the poor, uneducated, etc.  What I walked away with from the movie was the following:

1) the complexity of victimization, that in this society in an effort not to resolve the true core issues of our day, we spend all our focus on painstakingly analyzing why the victim is in the circumstances they find themselves and how its their fault.  In Precious, we witness the victimization of a young girl, and not till the end do we see the victimization of the mother, and we see nothing of the victimization of the father.

2) failures of a society, that in a society that doesn't spend all its resources in maximally developing its citizenry, but instead creates multiple layers of winners based on categories of class, race, education, wealth and sex - you instead maximize victimization.  Obviously a highly victimized society, were any victim can then turn perp, but for the most part doesn't turn activist is one that can be better managed and controlled and continually denied basic dignity.

3) choices, that each and every day we all have the choice to make our lives and the lives of others better from our vantage point. On our job when someone is being targeted, do you have the courage not to join in for fear you will be next.  In your relatoinship when it becomes clear that it has taken an unhealthy turn, do you have the courage to seek support and the relationship's end instead of allowing the robbing of years of your life.  As a professional doctor, lawyer, officer, etc. with the special priviliedges you enjoy in this society, your actions can be catastrophic to an individual's life, do you have the courage to not fall into the trap of feeling that the lives of others don't count, and therefore don't warrant your compassion or whatever real and safe assistance at your disposal.

4) justice, that each and everyone on this planet is deserving and in so believing that all of our resources must be brought to bear in order to bring about peace, justice, and the upliftment of life wherever we find ourselves.  That it is not victims that are weak for they have truly survived unimaginable horrors, weakness are in the actions of the perp who neither possess the compulsion or imagination to do something other than harming/maiming/raping or killing of others as well as those who simply walk away (physically or mentally) when their resources could be of use.

Precious wasn't simply about the abuse of a young black girl; it was about the abuse and victimization of all people everywhere.  I commend the writers, producers, actors and actresses, etc. having the courage to make this movie and in so doing - make a statement.

Now what are we going to do??",1268524800,8,2760,4.736951983298539
4106198,3,B003BEDAVS,"This movie is ""ok"" at best; not the worst I've seen lately and not the best. Compared to the other Oscar noms that I have seen, it is a middle of the pack film.

The movie's two biggest strengths are the acting by Mo'Nique and the gritty dialouge that adds a depth to an overall unsatisfying plot. The movie's plot begs the audience to feel every emotion possible in under two hours and seems not to have any real goal other than keeping the audience enthralled through one shocking moment after another. In fact, this was my problem with Precious: everything in the film seems to be done for shock value - each plot development is more shocking than the previous. Yet, the overall plot has little substance in my opinion; Precious tries to tackle too many social issues at once and does not explore any of them with the depth needed to be a truly moving film.

This is a fast-paced movie that does not spend much energy on character development or depth beyond the superficial level needed to keep the plot going. We get a taste of why the characters are the way they are but not much more. We get no explanation as to why Precious' father raped her (as we never meet him in the movie) and we only get an unsatisfying explanation as to why her mother allowed the rape to occur. Even the final scenes at the social worker's office felt unfinished; I was waiting for more and all we get is Precious leaving with both of her kids. The dialouge did explain why Precious was allowed to be raped, but this (like many other concepts in the movie) should have been futher explored.

This movie left me feeling empty, but not in the emotionally-drained way that a good movie can make you feel. I just felt like, ""so, that's it? What was all the hype about?"" Personally, I think because the movie's subject matter was so taboo and the language was so raw the movie received alot of undeserved accolades.",1268438400,,1894,4.452449567723343
4106199,5,B003BEDAVS,"""Precious"" is one of those movies I cannot imagine watching again, if only because the subject matter is so harrowing and the message so powerful that it suffices to watch it once. Based on the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious-Push-Movie-Tie-in-Edition-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0307474844/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious (Push Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage Contemporaries)</a>&nbsp;by Sapphire, the story traces the ""awakening"" of an abused teen Clarisse aka Precious (Gabourey Sidibe in a powerful screen debut) from a lifetime of abuse and neglect to a new life of promise and hope. Precious is an obese and lonely teenager who has suffered immense pain at the hands of her parents - her mother, Mary (Mo'nique whose credible portrayal of a cruel and abusive mother won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) has been systematically abusing Precious over the years, blaming her for 'stealing' her man, i.e. Precious' father (who has been sexually abusing Precious since she was three, and who has fathered two children with Precious). In school, Precious is almost invisible, not being able to read, and it is only when her second pregnancy is discovered that she is recommended for alternative education.

It is here that Precious' life takes a turn for the better - finally, a teacher 'sees' Precious as an individual, cares about her welfare and takes an interest in her education. This plays out credibly on-screen and it's not like Precious finds her path immediately and achieves self-actualization. The path to finding her true potential is a long and arduous one, but Precious gradually realizes that she needs to put a stop to the cycle of abuse and take responsibility for her own life as well as those of her two young children. The scenes of abuse are juxtaposed against 'daydream'/fantasy scenes where Precious imagines the life she wishes for herself - being a glamorous celebrity signing autographs, dancing in the spotlight with a handsome young man, singing in a church choir...these scenes are compelling because they provide us insight into Precious' mind and soul, and convince the viewer that a tortured and damaged soul like Precious can still dream of a promising future.

The performances are heartbreaking as they are compelling - and there are two more notable performances here, i.e. Paula Patton's luminescent portrayal as Precious' teacher at the alternative school (with an equally inspiring name Blu Rain), and also Mariah Carey in a unglamorous, sans make-up role portraying a welfare worker. Ultimately, Precious' story is one of grace and human dignity under the most trying circumstances. Powerful indeed.",1268438400,,2701,5.5375302663438255

Precious chose to continue to get an education and to be a great mother to both of her children instead of allowing her mother to USE her and her children as welfare checks...WOW.
I hope more movies can be made with positive messages without foul language.",1268438400,,513,4.468085106382978
4106201,5,B003BEDAVS,"""Precious"" is not a pretty story, but as Mo'nique said in her Oscar delivery speech, this could happen to anyone of any race. It is most definitely a story that needs to be told; many disadvantaged people have a tough time. Ignorance and abuse, both physical and mental, are well-examined (as well as the overt welfare abuse that is bringing our country down). The magnificent Gabourey Sidibe has dreams, though she's obese and abused; what can become of her if she doesn't make a move? I wondered why this film got an Oscar nom for Editing, until I saw the film itself. There's no question that director Lee Daniels was in love with his material (Oscar-winner Geoffrey Fletcher's script), and the load of talent he ran with. It's a journey of understanding, discovery, renewal, redemption and, ultimately, dignity that ALL young persons can and should relate to. Wonderful support from Paula Patton and Mariah Carey are essential to the catharsis, where the  magnificent Mo'nique meets her reality. Watch, absorb, reflect and think of this as a terrific depiction of someone who dreams of better things, while trapped in a life of despair. I will buy this DVD, if only to revel in the acting. Aside from some of the profanity, I would recommend all kids, who think they're at dead end, should take Precious' trip to contentment and happiness. Ms Sidibe is not playing herself.

4106203,5,B003BEDAVS,"I meant to write a review of ""Precious"" even before I watched it. Lots of times, writing the review is more satisfying than watching the film. This is harder. I felt my heart constrict in the first scene of Precious. My eyes and temple began to throb. I could scarcely catch my breath the rest of the way through the film. ""Life"" requires too much of us sometimes. Sometimes even a simulation of Life requires too much.

Improbable as it may seem, coming from a retired classical musician like me, who has lived fairly well most of his life, a lot of the misery portrayed in Precious is horribly familiar and real. The poverty and brutishness and the haplessness of both takers and givers of ""welfare"" are not exaggerated here. Yeah, things seldom move that quickly or that much in 'real time', and yeah, Precious's classmates evolve from intolerable to empathetic as if by miracle. But the story line isn't very central to this film, or rather to my response to this film, which is all Sorrow for all of us, from Precious to Queen Elizabeth II. Life hurts too much. The rosy glow of Hope in ""Precious"", which some critics have applauded and some derided, is more light than warmth. There really isn't much chance for that girl-woman in the film, except for the one-in-sixty-million chance that she'll be discovered by a film maker.

""Precious"" had a hundred times the impact on me that ""The Hurt Locker"" had. But I can't sit in judgment on the ""art"" of it as cinema. For sure, I won't forget it as quickly as I do most films.",1268352000,15,1526,4.545454545454546
4106204,5,B003BEDAVS,"As a middle class white dude, Precious is the last sort of movie I ever thought I'd want to watch, much less rave about. But for some reason, even before all the Oscar season hype, it caught my attention. Having missed it in theaters on account of nobody wanting to go with me, I blindly bought the DVD and was extremely impressed with the actors' performances and the handling of subject matters related to sex, incest, HIV, poverty, and abuse.

Several other reviews have outlined the plot pretty thoroughly so I won't rehash it all here, but I will emphasize that Precious is not so much a linear story, with a clear cut beginning and end, as it is just a glimpse into the life of a young girl who is coming to realize she wants (and deserves) something more. I cannot praise Gabourey Sidibe enough for taking on such a gritty role with virtually no professional experience, and of course Mo'Nique is wonderful, if not horrifying, as well. Very powerful performances from both women. Even Mariah Carey, who I absolutely detest as a singer, was not only competent, but likeable in this film, as was the underrated Paula Patton. Every facial expression and every bodily movement was meaningful, yet came out naturally. I haven't seen a movie this well cast in a long time.

I guess I can't really add anything that hasn't been mentioned many times over already, but I just wanted to throw out one more 5 star review because I think it was an all around well-made movie, and even though I personally can't relate to any aspects of it in my own life on any level, I found myself somehow connected to the characters and emotionally touched. You really can tell that the actors and production crew submerged themselves completely in this story and it draws the viewer in. Plus I think it's totally ridiculous how some people give it one star reviews just for the fact that it's depressing, which is true, but subject matter has no bearing on cinematography.

DVD extras are pretty standard, though I would have liked to have heard more from Gabby since she seems like an awesome and grounded young lady in real life. All the best to her.",1268265600,3,2134,4.610526315789474

Precious, based o the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire, is the story of a forgotten segment of our society, a young, inner-city black girl, living a life of hell. Sexually abused by her father, physically and emotionally abused by her mother, Precious finds the strength to get up from her bed and face her bleak life, mostly by a fiery imagination. When she is discovered to be pregnant for a second time, Precious is expelled from her school and is offered a spot in an alternative school. The teacher at the school, Ms. Rain, does something amazing: she sees Precious. That act alone begins to crack the protective cocoon that Precious has built around herself to survive.

Not enough can be said about Gabourey Sidibe, who takes Precious, fully realizes her, and makes her soar. Also equally as stunning is the comedian Mo'Nique, who portrays the mother with such intensity that her performance leaps off the screen and grabs you by the throat. There were scene between these two actresses that literally left me gasping for air, I was holding my breath for so long.

As Precious begins to find herself, begins to find who she is, she also discovers her place in life, and her strength. Towards the end of the movie, Precious reflects on this strength, and says, about her teacher:

""Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before. And in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel, they still be shining for everybody else.""

Precious could also be talking about herself.

Lee Daniels has given us a gift. It's not an easy gift to watch. It's not an easy story to tell. But it's real. As she emerges from her cocoon, we see Precious' face for the first time, with glimmers of hope, glimmers of optimism, glimmers of tomorrow. She is finding her wings, she is learning to fly.

Every child in America should have that hope.",1268179200,,2340,4.610576923076923

Mariah Carey also was very good in her role as social worker.
As Precious was dealt blow after blow in life, a few kind people help save her. More to the point of this story was that she saved herself through her love for her children.

The beginning was very boring.  I would not recommend anyone to purchase this movie.  Yes these things really happens in real life.

4106209,4,B003BEDAVS,"Clarece ""Precious"" Jones is an overweight black girl , pregnant with her second child, living with her abusive mother in 1980's Harlem. This is the simple story of how she gets the strength to go outside herself to try and make a better life for herself. The film succeeds because of how well it neutralizes its schmaltzy premise. Precious is a victim of unconscionable abuse, which we see but only in enough detail to form a bond with her and care about her welfare- explicit this film is not. What it is instead is an honest depiction of a life that is lived by many in the real world, but without the outlet or the compassion to help them rise out of it. Its characters are real people, some serious, some funny, but all with a familiarity to them that you get attached to. Everyone, that is, except for Precious' mother, played with incredible rage by Oscar-winner Mo'Nique. Her Lennox Ave. apartment is the eighth circle of hell, a compact box of rage, regret, anger and toxicity. Precious' journey out of there and into a life without pain or misery is inspiring both for its honesty as well as its lack of manipulation for the viewer.

We have seen this program  over and over and over again, on Oprah, Jerry Springer or on those so-called reality shows (didn't MTV and VH1 used to specialize in music?). Practically every black female author uses a variation of this plot line ad nauseum. This is less ""exposing"" reality than misandrist wish-fulfillment, which in its own way perpetuates racism by perpetuating stereotypes. The only difference between this movie (and novel) and a typical Springer show is that being obese, unattractive, uneducated like ""Precious"" can not ""always"" be explained by being the victim of a rapist father, uncle or brother--or mother. Maybe the inner city environment is to blame, or maybe she has personality defects, or isn't interested in eating properly or the way she looks. Maybe she's bored in school.

4106215,4,B003BEDAVS,"In Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, inner city life for a desperate teen is portrayed as a hopeless cycle of poverty, neglect, and despair.  As envisioned by director Lee Daniels from the adaptation by Geoffrey Fletcher, life is hard and only redeemed by people who care and are willing to nurture the abused victim.  This is a harrowing look at a dysfunctional family and one girl's hope for a better life, and it benefits from towering performances by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique who bring home this heartfelt, slice of life.

The story opens with a pleasant, idyllic family setting with a teenager, Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), and the fantasy turns suddenly into a stark reality.  It is 1987 Harlem where Precious lives as a cook, gofer, and almost as a slave to her domineering, abusive mother (Mo'Nique).  Together, they are poor, always hungry and living on welfare.  She hopes for a normal existence and is always beaten down verbally, physically and emotionally by her mom and the neighborhood gangs.  She was pregnant at age 16 by her abusive, absentee father and already has a small, mentally challenged child by him.  To escape her despair, she daydreams of a loving and supportive storybook world.

Switched to an alternative school that specializes in troubled youth, she meets a disparate group of girls and a disciplined teacher, Miss Rain (Paula Patton).  Precious learns to read and understand a world beyond the confines of her existence.  She begins to trust her teacher, and her support group is this motley group of classmates.  This support comes into play when she gives birth to her second child and when her mother attacks her.

Her mother is so manipulative that she wants to stay on welfare, and she makes no secret of her distrust of white people.  She even puts on a pretend act for a visiting social worker.  At the welfare office, another social worker (Mariah Carey in no makeup) learns the horrible truth about Precious' home life.  Before long, Precious receives bad news that rocks her world and sets up a confrontation with her manipulative, con-artist of a mom and determines an uncertain future for herself and her children.

Daniels lends a very sure hand in directing this powerful story.  Even as a novice director, he grabs his audience and keeps you involved in a very interesting tale based on truth. He offers a fresh perspective and after a success at producing (Monsters Ball, The Woodsman), is a talent to watch. The film is shot in almost a handheld semi-documentary manner.  The budget must have been modest which suits the setting and story.  Its technique and exposition belie an independent film (Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are executive producers).

Sidibe and Mo'Nique carry the show, but Patton and Carey are quite good as supportive characters.  Singer Lenny Kravitz has a small but effective part as a male nurse who befriends Precious.

The only real negative is that the film ends abruptly which may be just the point-that life does go on and it does so on Precious' own terms.  This is no Hollywood ending, that's for sure.  Also, repetitive use is made of Precious' daydream fantasies of a happier life.  It almost veers to self parody although there is an excellent moment where she dresses in front of a mirror and sees a well dressed white woman; so much for visual statements about self image.

So good are the portrayals of Precious and her mom that the other characters are given only marginal exposition.  We want to learn more about her teacher and her classmates, but this is, after all, a story about Precious.  For her first acting gig, Sidibe does a remarkable job, and Mo'Nique is so convincing as a maternal monster, that Oscar beckons.  For a film based on real life experiences and truths, this one is hard to beat.",1267747200,3,3820,4.832307692307692
4106216,5,B003BEDAVS,"PRECIOUS is the most powerful film that I have seen this year. It is a film that I will never forget as long as I live. It is a film that pulls you deep in to hell and then, right when you least expect it, pulls you out of the abyss to show you the light. It is the story of a young black woman - the miraculous Gabby Sidibe - who is morbidly obese, impoverished, pregnant with her second child, and the subject of much abuse and ridicule. Most of the abuse comes from her mother, who is content to emotionally tear down her daughter while living off of a welfare check. She is a monster, plain and simple. Hope comes in the form of higher education, as Precious scores into an advanced educational program at school and, unbeknownst to her mother, starts classes with her new teacher, Ms. Rain. There, she learns to read and write, and through the encouragement of her teacher, starts to keep a journal of her daily life. At the school, Precious develops friendships and starts to grow intellectually. Little do her classmates know about the abuse at home, and the fact that Precious is pregnant with her father's child. Despite everything, she is determined to better herself, and retains a hopeful spirit.

It is NOT a film for children. It is NOT a film for prudes. However, it is a film that most Christians should see. This is the real world, folks. This is the reality that many ""Christian"" films gloss over, or ignore entirely. This is a story of real pain and real hope. Most have criticized this film for being overly depressing. I didn't find it to be so. I came out of the film not knowing what to say, but I felt joy for the main character in the film, and I was happy for her.

The performances in this film are amazing all around. Mo'Nique makes you believe in the darker side of humanity, and her performance is horrifying. Deserves many nominations come awards season. It is sad that most of the Christian viewers have chosen not to focus on the films positive content, but on the alleged ""gay agenda"" that some believe the film promotes. This is hogwash, and couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, there are two lesbian characters. Get over it. Such is life. Gays and lesbians walk amongst us, and it is our job to show them the love of Christ and, as artists, reflect the truth of the world by giving them a part in the worlds that we create. Aside from that pointless bit of controversy, the film is a milestone. What could have been a boring cliche is actually one of the most rewarding films of the year. By no means entertaining, it is a film that needs to be seen.

Graphic scenes of rape and pervasive language make this a hard-R film that is entirely inappropriate for children. Surprisingly, at the screening that I attended, five and six year olds were present.",1267401600,4,2791,4.447265625

walks into an open casting call for a film based on a book she'd never read before,
and on the sheer strength of her personality and intuitiveness about the character
which she is reading for...she lands the leading role, Precious Jones, in one of
the most powerful and talked about films of 2009!
That in itself sounds like a treatment for a screenplay, but it's all too real
and a star was truly found in this huge untapped talent.
But she shares this breakthrough performance with another amazing performance
which alot of people didn't see coming...
The damaged, sick, and downright evil character who is Precious' mother,
Mary Jones, played with scarry intensity and zeal by comedienne / actress /
talk show host MONIQUE!!
WOW!!---She scared the crap out of alot of people with her absolutely despicable
potrayal of a character who has been so kicked in the head and wounded by life
that she has become a warped monstrous shell of a human being!
Her Golden Globe, SAG & Brit wins as well as her Oscar nom for best supporting
actress is well deserved and many expect her to win the Oscar on March 7, 2010.
Gabourey Sidibe, despite turning in a great performance and being nominated
in all of the same awards, did score a win at the 2010 NAACP Image Awards
for best actress in a dramatic role.

I must say that this film wouldn't have flown as high as it did without
the stellar & soulful direction of Lee Daniels, the supporting cast, or the
production power players that are Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey!
This movie was so heart-wrenchingly raw and filled with such emotional angst
that there were times that I found myself clinching up in my seat or covering
my eyes or mouth in disbelief at the harrowing abuse and circumstances which
Precious has to endure at the hands of her mother, her father, and just life in general!
I found myself asking why do some people have to go through such things in this life,
and yet they go on with their heads held up as best they can!
It also made me appreciate the fact that though many of us have had struggles
in this life, there is always somebody else's story who comes along to make
us say ""Well, my god!--At least I didn't have it THAT bad!!--I should be thankful!""

if it weren't for the levity of the supporting cast, mainly Lenny Kravitz's
portryal of a compassionate (and hot!) male nurse, and of course the teacher
at the school for wayward girls that Precious has to attend,
played beautifully by actress Paula Patton. What else can I say, other than
this is a very special film which may be too strong for some people,

4106221,3,B003BEDAVS,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

For most viewers who hated 'Precious', one of the primary objections was the film tended to reinforce stereotypes of African-Americans. If taken literally (as some have done), one can conclude that the negative, 'acting-out' behavior in lower class black neighborhoods is typical of almost ALL black people in such environments. If this was so, why would Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry promote such a film? The answer is that the film is not intended to represent the complex reality of life in the inner city. Rather, it is an intentional exaggeration for dramatic effect.

Since the 19th century, melodrama has been the most commercially successful of all types of drama (think of films such as 'Gone With the Wind' or 'Titanic'). Basic Melodrama is tragedy reduced to a more simplistic level which the masses can more easily understand. Characters in melodrama are pretty much one-dimensional, with clearly defined heroes (or heroines) and villains. The audience of course identifies with the hero but it is the villain that they're truly interested in. A successful melodrama always features a maniacal and better yet, diabolical, villain.

'Precious' wins points in serving up its own entry in the diabolical villain category, Mary, the mother from hell, played by Mo'Nique. When she's alone with Precious, she treats her own daughter as if she's her personal slave: there are physical beatings and constant psychological humiliation. Worse, she stands by as she allows Precious's father (her boyfriend) to rape and later impregnate her daughter twice. It's hinted that Precious's first daughter ends up with Down's Syndrome due to a beating received by the mother from hell while Precious is pregnant. Mary callously refers to the first child as ""Mongo"" (for 'Mongoloid') and sends her off to be raised by her own mother since she refuses to help raise the child herself. Mary is also a classic manipulator--when a social worker comes by to check on the family, she has her own mother bring over the mentally challenged child and pretend that she's been caring for the child all along (thus allowing herself to continue to receive public assistance benefits). During the film's climax, she begs Precious' social worker (well-played by a low-key Mariah Carey) to have Precious and her new child come back to her. Her pleas fall on deaf ears after she continues to blame Precious for the problems in the family (in Mary's warped mind, she's the victim since Precious 'stole' her boyfriend away from her after she did nothing to stop him from raping her).

The joys of developing a well-thought out and clever villain, are usually tempered by a contrasting stock and predictable victim. There isn't much new under the sun when it comes to Precious, the overweight black girl who suffers from extreme low self-esteem. Once authorities at her regular school discover that Precious is once again pregnant, she's sent to an 'alternative school' for girls with behavior problems. There it's discovered that she's reading on the second grade level and gradually through the intervention of a tough but caring teacher, she eventually overcomes her illiteracy and is reading at the 7th and 8th grade levels by the end of the film. While the contrasting scenes with her mother are always fraught with dramatic tension, the energy is not as intense in all the 'classroom scenes' which feature characters which we've seen in many other countless movies before, about acting out adolescent girls.

In addition to all the abuse she suffers at home as well as the taunting by other children and teenagers in the neighborhood, Precious must overcome one last overwhelming obstacle--the fact that she's been diagnosed as being HIV Positive. But even that won't stop the film's scenarist and producers from having Precious fade into the sunset with her head held high. Remember, this is a melodrama, and in melodrama you never tarnish your protagonist (the victim!). Sure, there are a few hints that Precious has her faults (she doesn't like the idea of working for her public assistance benefits for example) but it might have been a much more interesting film had the screenwriters grafted a few more ugly traits from the mother onto Precious' personality. Instead, despite all the low self-esteem, the deck is stacked so that Precious comes off almost like a saint.

Precious is by no means a boring film. It moves along and has a series of neat, 'fantasy' sequences, highlighting Precious's rich fantasy life. As stated above, Precious is successful when it focuses on the very strong character of the villainous mother. Otherwise, the story of the heroine, who must rise from extreme adversity, is a story that we've seen many, many times before. For those who like their stories simple where the moral conflict is clear cut, Precious is for you. For those who want something a little more complex, Precious might just not be satisfying enough.",1265500800,6,4976,5.054811205846528
4106222,5,B003BEDAVS,"I've been trying to see all of the movies that feature large in the awards season and frankly had been putting this one off.  By and large I've not been impressed by the films that have received many of the nominations this year.  Many of them are amazingly bland and disappointing.  PRECIOUS is a delightful exception.  Not that it is a delightful film.  It is often hard to watch, but nonetheless moving and very powerful.  The story of a morbidly obese, illiterate sixteen-year-old who is pregnant with her second child (both by her father) and physically abused by her hopelessly inept mother (played brilliantly by Mo'Nique), this should have been the bummer film to end all bummer films.  But you really come to love Clarice (Precious).  Despite things getting worse and worse for her, you feel a tremendous sense of triumph for her when she manages to pull her reading level up from a second grade to a seventh grade level.  And despite the horrid abuse that she has suffered, she is determined to be a better mother to her two children than either her mother or father were to her.

And what can you say about Gabourey Sidibe?  This is one of the great debut performances ever by an actress.  Ironically, in the depths of her horrible life Precious daydreams of being loved and finding improbable success as a celebrity, including a movie star.  Now, I'm sure Gabourey Sidibe has not had a bad life, but who in the world would fantasize about getting an Oscar nomination for her first screen role?  But that is precisely what she has achieved.  And it is a nomination that she richly deserved, just as Mo'Nique deserved her nomination as best supporting actress.  Mariah Carey also does a very credible job in a small but important supporting role.

The movie is also a terrible indictment of American society.  On the one hand we are in the gripes of a national fever of hatred towards government, the only entity in most countries that does much to help salvage the lives of others.  On the other hand, we are in the grips of a national passion for self-interested greed, with a vast right wing that has subtly absorbed libertarian notions (deriving not only from Ayn Rand, but especially from her) that compassion is a vice and blind self-interest a virtue.  More than any other developed nation and despite almost inconceivable national wealth, millions of Americans suffer the fate of children like Precious.  I personally consider those who possess the kind of self-interest advocated by Rand and many conservatives to be nothing short of monstrous, to be aberrations of nature, moral deformities.  One of my closest friends is a social worker and says that Precious's story is far from unique, but in fact a commonplace.  Why we in America, the richest country in the world, won't do anything to help all Americans is a mystery to me.

This ought to be a must-see movie for everyone.  It is an extremely well-acted, deeply moving, and well-directed film that anyone who loves movies will enjoy.",1265500800,10,3009,4.773694390715668

""And the Oscar for outstanding achievement by an actress in a supporting role goes to... Mo'Nique, for Precious."" There's your quote folks; sure to be said at this year's ceremony. Her performance was hands down the best I have seen from any actor, thus far in 2009.

Mo'Nique plays Mary; an abusive mother who unrightfully blames her 16-year-old daughter for her husband leaving. Mary is haunted by herself and takes it out on those closest to her and would take it out on the world; if she ever left the couch. Mo'Nique's acting nearly knocked me out my seat, it was so powerful.

Mary's daughter is Clarice who more often than not goes by Precious. Precious is a very troubled girl. At 16, she's still in middle school, her mother is on welfare and beats her continuously, and she's obese and pregnant with her second child.

I was sure that she undoubtedly had a troubled past, but I found myself blaming her for her predicament. No-one forced her to have unprotected sex, right? I won't disclose what we learn next, but I felt like a complete jerk for judging her character in such an ignorant way.

New-comer Gabourey `Gabby' Sidibe plays Precious and has my vote for a lead Oscar nomination, and will probably receive one. Watching her in this film, you wonder if perhaps she truly lived the life of this young girl. Gabby is a full decade older than her character, but we don't notice. She flawlessly portrays this troubled youth, who we feel for in every scene. We love her from the moment we meet her.

Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are both experts at evoking emotion from their live audiences and movie-goers. They have done nothing less with Precious, as two of its producers.

The film is dark and gritty and may leave you questioning yourself in matters regarding the way you have judged or treated others in your life. No matter how you've had it, Precious magnificently shows both how hateful and twisted people can be, and how beautiful we can be to one anther.

Precious is constantly abused, picked on, ridiculed and taken for granted. But she keeps on trucking'; with far more strength and courage than most of us would have the stomach for.

She copes by escaping into a personal fantasy. We see several beautiful shots of her fantasizing of having her picture taken, boys drooling over her and her walking down red carpet. While I enjoyed these shots immensely, I would have liked to have seen Precious achieve more of her potential. The film feels a little incomplete without this.

Regardless, the movie is still very entertaining and was shot amazingly. I'm sure it will win for best cinematography as well. Director Lee Daniels, who is also partly responsible for bringing us Monster's Ball, is an amazing artist.

In addition to the visual spunk he gave this film, Daniels has also shattered any doubts of comedians and musicians not being able to act. Mo'Nique is a hilarious comedian; Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz are wonderful musicians and all of them become excellent actors in this film.

Gabourey Sidibe (Precious) and Mo'Nique as her mother( if you can call her that) really give it their all, and it is sometimes horrifying and mostly depressing to witness. For me, this was more of a character film than a film with a good plot. This film deals with incest, sexual abuse of the most horrifying kind, poverty, and lastly, what it means to have a dream. Precious has a dream, she has plenty in fact, but in her mind, she will always be the poor, obese girl from Harlem with the worst mother in history and pretty much a dead-end life. Already her life is massively screwed up. Pregnant by her own father for the second time, doing poorly in school and constantly abused at home, it seems she could sink no further. Her mother resents her (for reasons that will be revealed at the end of the film), and tells Precious flat-out that she should have aborted her. Precious seems to be used to this and she remains quiet and unassuming for alot of the movie.

Precious is given the opportunity to go to an alternative school where it seems, for a bit, that things can turn around for her. But reality always rears its ugly head sooner or later and her situation takes a nose-dive. I don't want to spoil anything or discuss the plot too much only to say that at times, I felt like I wasn't watching anything new. I don't want to diminish the great performances, but I'm pretty sure we've all seen films with people such as this, in situations and locations pretty similar. If you are going to watch this film, expect great performances, and don't be too dissapointed that the actual plot doesn't have anything fresh or new to offer.",1264982400,3,1722,4.501597444089457

4106226,5,B003BEDAVS,"Saddled with an unwieldy subtitle due to another film of the novel's original name being released in 2008, ""Precious"" is nevertheless one of the standout films of 2009.  The second film of director Lee Daniels (the first went undistributed), previously the producer of some films as ""Monster's Ball"" and ""The Woodsman"", this is a grueling look at life in the lowest dregs of American society, where hope for the future is a fragile thing indeed.  Backed by such prominent African American media icons as Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, it is a film well worth seeing.

We open in Harlem in 1987, in an America wholly divorced from the ""Morning in America"" that Ronald Reagan spoke of.  Claireece ""Precious"" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe, in an amazing breakout performance; sadly, I can't imagine someone of her weight getting too many lead roles in the future) is sixteen years old, obese, illiterate, and more or less listless.  One can hardly blame her, given the circumstances:  repeatedly raped and twice impregnated by her own father, she lives with her abusive mother Mary (comedian Mo'Nique, playing way against type in a searing depiction of pure evil).  Precious struggles to make her way forward, while a collection of moderately sympathetic authority figures (something of a first for her) enter the picture.  Chief among these is Ms. Rain (first name Blu; someone's mother didn't like her very much), played by Paula Patton, and a social worker played by Mariah Carey (deglammed to the point of unrecognizability).

Based on an even bleaker novel, ""Precious"" would probably cause Thomas Hardy himself to balk and advise a bit of letting up on the protagonist.  The cast, virtually all female (the only significant male character is Lenny Kravitz as a male nurse, and there are half a dozen characters with more screentime than him), carries the film.  Sidibe and Mo'Nique, the latter virtually sweeping the supporting actress awards this year, are the main attractions.  Mo'Nique's Mary is the year's most frightening cinematic villain.  Also deserving recognition is Patton, who is luminous (and seemingly the only castmember with access to makeup, which makes her stand out even more).  Carey and Kravitz also acquit themselves well in their minor roles.

Recommended (for those with a strong stomach).",1264550400,4,2309,5.136363636363637
4106227,3,B003BEDAVS,"Start with the title of this highly touted film PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL ""PUSH"" BY SAPPHIRE. That seems a bit presumptuous. Then note that the film's Executive Producers are Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, and that the film includes Mariah Carey in the cast and the piece seems to have been directed toward notice by the Academy people. For this viewer this is a nice little story that is a very touching examination of the life of a girl with all odds against her who survives it all. Lee Daniels directs an interesting cast who bring off Geoffrey Fletcher's screenplay with all of its street talk very well. But is the overall effect worth all the hoopla?

Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) is an obese, abused, illiterate 16 year old who has no friends and no support and is pregnant with her second child, the result of rape by her father. She lives with her worthless fat abusive mother Mary (Mo'Nique in a truly brilliant performance) and the two dwell in a hovel as dark as Precious' future: Precious' only salvation is in her dreams of being a glamorous singing and movie star and these sequences are well choreographed. There is a break through for Precious when she is placed in an Alternative School under the warmth and caring pedagogy by Blue Rain (Paula Patton) and she begins her journey to literacy and finding some sense of dignity. Along the way she is assisted by social worker Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey) and a day care worker played by the novel's author, Sapphire. Precious is surrounded by a classroom of interesting struggling teens - all well portrayed.

The standout performance in this film and the actress deserving of recognition is Mo'Nique. Gabourey Sidebe physically fills her part but she is given very little (except for a major final scene) to display talent. See the film out of curiosity and for the message it delivers.

4106228,5,B003BEDAVS,"So much praise has been lavished on this film, all of it justly deserved. From the opening scene until the ending, the movie holds you in its relentless grip. You will not see another film like this one this year or any other year for that matter.

First the actors-- to a person they are superb and totally convincing from Gabourey Sidibe as Precious to her mother Mary (Mo'Nique)to Mariah Carey as Precious' social worker Ms. Weiss to Paula Patton as Ms. Rain, her instructor at the alternative school. Someone or two will get awards for these performances. The young girls in the alternative school-- Precious has no idea what an anternative school is when her perceptive male teacher sees the good in her and sends her to one-- in their smaller roles are perfectly cast as well.

So many things could have gone wrong about this film, but it works on every level. The subject matter, the statements it makes, its ultimate truths hit you in your face: poverty, incest, teenage pregnancy, welfare abuse, child abuse but also survival and hope and the belief that education can help pull a lost soul out of the depths of despair and degradation.

I have been unable to get this film out of mind days after seeing it, a sure sign that I have witnessed a simply fantastic work of art.",1263254400,2,1282,4.5895196506550215
4106229,3,B003BEDAVS,"Like most ""slice of life"" movies meant to induce viewers' indignation and outrage at one injustice or another, ""Precious"" hits the mark with deadly precision. It would be almost inhuman not to pity Precious, or be outraged by her circumstances and (most of) the adults in her world, but no one should really be surprised. Her story represents an amalgam of all too real experiences suffered by teens and broken families irrespective of geographical or racial boundaries.

After so much emotional investment into the story and main character, the movie never offers a satisfying release. Nor should it- the story is dismal as dismal can be. Life sucks, and then you die. Painfully. ANy ""Hope & Change"" moments live only in her dreams and fantasies never to materialize into any real life experience. Precious was check-mated in life from the moment of her birth. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapies available in the 80's was marginally above placebo. How's that for a ""hopeful"".  And who would be granted legal guardianship of the children? Mostlikely their granny who did such a spectacular job with her own daughter. How's that for ""change"". The inept and impotent social services network available crumble in the breeze. Even her name, Precious, in the end is nothing more than a cruel sarcastic pun.

Predictably, this film is every critic's darling and is sure to rack up awards. However I am unaware of any reviews mentioning the failed liberal agenda responsible for Precious as a real person or merely in the abstract to actually exist. And so the praises are off the mark other than to rightfully congratulate some fantastic performances.

The real outrage provoked by stories such as this needs to be directed at the root cause which not only created this depravity but continually feeds and sustains it. If someone knows a film which more effectively exposes the cruelty of the welfare state then please let me know.

Take this movie as a simple glimpse into someone's dire life if you so wish, but better to think beyond that narrow view.

Precious is certainly bleak, but it's empowering and uplifting in a real way rather than a feel-good based-on-a-true-story kind of way. As the sad, dark revelations about her life unfold, the movie shifts inside her imagination to brief shots of Precious in her dreams. I loved this storytelling device; when the story got dark, there was something hopeful. The audience shared with Precious's coping mechanisms.

I absolutely loved the film as whole, even though it's not necessarily a film I want to rewatch. Gabby Sidibe was fantastic. Mo 'Nique has gotten a lot of positive reviews, but I found her performance adequate,  not amazing. Paula Patton, however, absolutely stole the film for me. She was mesmerizing, subtle and powerful.

4106231,5,B003BEDAVS,"Based on the novel, ""Push"", this is the story of an overweight, illiterate and pregnant teenager named Precious who is already the mother of one child who has Down's syndrome.  Gabourney Sidibe plays the title role and her performance is nothing less than extraordinary.  From the moment the film started, I entered her world, a ghetto world of searing poverty and constant verbal abuse from her mother played by Mo'nique.  Their scenes together made me shudder and it was hard to imagine that Precious would ever get out from under the horror of her life.

And then Precious goes to an alternative school, where her teacher, played by Paula Paton, gives her some hope.  There's also a sympathetic social worker played by Mariah Carey.  But most of all it is Precious' own strong will and determination that eventually changes her attitude towards life.  There's a positive message in this film and I left the theater smiling although I couldn't keep my eyes from filling with tears.

Hooray for this film!  It's unique, upsetting and both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.  It's no wonder the critics are raving.",1262217600,2,1128,4.920634920634921
4106232,5,B003BEDAVS,"I get the sense that ""Precious"" is the type of film, and type of story, written and made to be almost like a documentary, to provide insight into what the key people have experienced in their lives. All of the creative people behind the pen and the camera clearly identify with the characters and the situations. I suspect they have had personal experience with similar situations; don't know this for a fact, but the film is so moving, so well-made, so interesting, I feel this has to be the situation here.

I can't comment on how accurate the depiction of life for Precious, played by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe and her mother, played by Mo'Nique is, I have no reference point. But I can tell you the performances seem real.

I was talking with someone about this film and told her she had to see it. Their response? ""I think I can probably guess everything that happens in the film"". I thought about this for a moment and replied that she was probably right. But the real reason to see this film is because everybody involved seems to be so passionate about the story and the characters, leading them to take both to depths you wouldn't expect.

It is 1985 and Precious is an overweight, illiterate sixteen year old pregnant with her second child. She lives with her mom (Mo'Nique) in a shabby apartment in Harlem. Mom basically spends her days at home, watching television, eating and waiting for the welfare checks to arrive. When the weight of her life becomes too much, she takes her frustrations out on her daughter. Precious is good in one subject, math, and fantasizes about her math teacher, among many other things. One of these fantasies is interrupted by a call from the principal's office who confronts Precious and asks if she is pregnant again. Later, the principal shows up at their door step and her mom wants Precious to make her go away, she doesn't want anything or anyone to jeopardize her welfare checks. The principal recommends Precious attend a special school to help her get up to speed with her writing and work towards earning her GED. As soon as she arrives, Precious meets Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) who knows how to handle the group of rowdy girls in her class. Soon, everyone gets to know a bit about each other and Precious finds a refuge away from the horrors of her home. Along the way, she starts to tell the truth to a welfare worker (Mariah Carey). And a male nurse (Lenny Kravitz) also befriends her at the hospital when she gives birth to her second child. But she still has one wicked mother to contend with and won't ever be free until she is able to live her life without the influence of her mother.

Directed by Lee Daniels (""Shadowboxer"") and based on the book ""Push"" by Sapphire, the project was in development for a long time because Sapphire wanted the right people to make the film. Finally, Daniels, a relative unknown with one film to his credit, convinced her he had the right vision for the film and found newcomer Gabourey Sidibe to play the role of Precious. Everything seems to have fallen into place because ""Precious"" is the type of film that sears itself into your conscience. You won't forget this film for many, many years.

It strikes me as odd that people always judge a newcomer's performance by how true and real it is, how lifelike. Wouldn't you expect a newcomer to be able to portray a more real person? Yes and no. Often, an inexperienced or novice actor feels they have to 'act' and try to make the role seem showy or worthy. Or the actor is often too conscious of the camera and begins to play to it, directing all of their emotion and attention to the camera rather than the other actors. So when you find a newcomer who appears completely natural, completely at ease, it is something to announce, to herald, because the actor has done something that helps us get lost in the story. Gabby Sidibe does this as ""Precious"". It isn't a role filled with a lot of dialogue, but this seems right for this character. You get the sense she is quiet because she is afraid to speak to certain people and afraid to reveal her lack of knowledge. Also, her mother frequently yells at her and gets mad at her if she says the wrong thing. And she can't tell the truth to certain people, for fear of jeopardizing some sort of assistance, so she remains quiet to prevent the truth slipping out.

As we learn how truly bad this young ladies life is, we watch as she fantasizes about the things she wants in life. These moments are brief visual respites from the bleakness of her life, but because they happen whenever something bad is happening to Precious, they also take on a more ominous feeling. As some terrible events happen (some street kids throw something at Precious and knock her to the ground) she escapes by retreating to her fantasy life, imagining herself on the red carpet at an awards show with her light skinned boyfriend who has 'good hair'. These daydreams give us as much hope as they seem to give Precious.

It is nice to see that there is some hope in Precious. Even though she lives in an extremely abusive environment, she does fairly well at school and finds some refuge there. I think this is why she is so upset when called into the principal's office. If she gets kicked out of school, what does she have then? Where can she go to escape? So the alternative school is not really a choice for her and when she finds she likes it, it becomes more of a new home for her.

Gabby Sidoube hides a lot of her performance, letting it leak out through her eyes, her facial expressions, her body language. And this fits perfectly for a teenaged girl. We can see when the rage becomes too much and she acts out against her mother, when her exasperation at the living conditions becomes too much for her to bare and when the world weighs too heavily on her, there are moments, brief and fleeting, that give us all of the information we need. Sidoube doesn't say a lot in her portrayal of Precious, but she conveys a lot.

Mo'Nique does a mesmerizing job of bringing Precious' mother, Mary to life. We have all seen abusive parents portrayed on the screen before, but Mo'Nique digs deep and makes this character truly frightening. Mary doesn't want to work and prefers to sit in their dingy apartment, surrounded by too many cats, eating and waiting for her daughter to return from school. She would clearly rather not have Precious go to school and would keep her home to provide constant companionship and attention. But she needs Precious to go to school to continue to get Welfare. She also pretends to love Precious' first child, who was born with birth defects, in order to get Welfare. But as soon as the Welfare worker is gone, she hands the child to her mother who is caring for the little girl.

Bored and finding herself with way too much time on her hands, she watches television, naps, tries to fill the time. When Precious comes home, she take her frustrations out on her daughter.

Mo'Nique doesn't seem to have any inhibition in her portrayal of one of the most unpleasant people you are likely to ever experience. Slow dancing with her self, she undulates next to their little television, some sitcom playing mindlessly in the background. Most actresses would try to inject some redeeming qualities into this character, but Mo'Nique doesn't. She seems to realize that would be wrong for Mary, Mary has been beaten down by life and will now do her best to beat down everyone else in her life. If she can't have something, why should anyone else? She is truly abusive and should be locked up. The performance is very good and deserves some recognition when Awards season begins.

As the story progresses, there are little glimmers of hope in Precious' life. Ms. Rain (Patton) seems to realize what is going on in her newest student's life and tries to help her, befriending her at one point. When Precious begins telling the truth to the Social Worker (Carey), we can see a weight lifted from her shoulders. And the social worker begins to help Precious. People show her some kindness when they begin to get the whole picture. You get a sense that even with all of her problems, all of the challenges in her life, Precious might just have a chance.

It's a slim chance, but a chance nonetheless.

""Precious"" is the type of independent film we haven't seen in a while, raw, vibrant, meaningful and memorable.",1262044800,3,8390,4.573519627411843
4106233,5,B003BEDAVS,"The story takes us on the journey of this monstrously mistreated young female from near destruction at the hands of her violent, hyper-narcissistic mother (Mo'Nique) and her rapist father (who has impregnated her twice by age 16) to a rescue with the help of a frayed but still somewhat viable network of dedicated social workers who help her gain literacy and independence from her wicked elders.

Interspersed with the depressing realities of ghetto life is the constant flow of Precious's glamorous daydreams, the little fires generated by her undying spark of life, her only opening toward beauty and light, imagining herself wrapped in beautiful gowns, doted on by handsome men, cheered by adoring crowds on the red carpet; wealth, fame, as she knows them from the pop culture that is her only mental nourishment. For her mother and for herself, life is an endless round of TV-food-arguments-TV-food-arguments. In their dark and dingy apartment, practically the only illumination is from the TV screen.

Mo'Nique's performance is revelatory on multiple levels, down to the bone of the human condition and certainly up to the highest screen standards. It is bravura work. Sibide's performance is technically masterful but much of her effectiveness comes from her imposing physical presence; this is not meant to detract one iota from her acting skills - it is just a fact. The excellent supporting performances include a pleasing turn from singer Mariah Carey as a down-to-earth social worker with a playful personality; it's an inventive characterization. But the whole cast excels and they should be honored for great ensemble work, especially the young ladies in the special education classroom.

Flaws? The pacing seems to slow down unnecessarily toward the end and Precious's educational progression seems a bit confused and not completely fleshed out, but this is minor stuff. This is a very inspired work of art by someone with a fresh vision. It is not preaching morals or slogans, just revealing truth.",1261008000,2,2015,5.212962962962963
4106234,5,B003BEDAVS,"Precious is an outstanding, powerful, gritty, poignant and memorable film--period. I am amazed at just how well this film was done. Look for this film and/or some of the actors in it to be nominated for Oscars--this is all THAT good. Yes, there is some violence that will shock some people; but tragically the problems depicted in this movie really do happen. If you can, don't let the violence stop you from seeing Precious. The plot moves along at a very good pace although it manages almost magically never to rush things; and that's remarkable in and of itself. The casting couldn't have been better; and the cinematography works wonders along with that choreography. The script is brilliant, too.

When the film starts, we meet Clareece 'Precious' Jones (Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe), who goes by the name ""Precious.""  Precious is a rather overweight 16 year old who is still in junior high school and expecting her second child--again by her own father! Her mother, Mary (Mo'Nique) is also terribly abusive--she is a recluse living without dreams or hope as she throws things at Precious' head while Precious makes their dinner--and Mary throws more things at Precious than just small things! Mary also curses out Precious in a very abusive way; she's like a monster of horrific proportions.

When Precious is essentially kicked out of school, her principal refers her to an ""alternative"" school, Each One Teach One, which, by the way, is a real alternative school located in Harlem, New York for persons who need extra help with their schoolwork and more. Precious isn't even sure what an ""alternative"" school is, but she decides to try it and with the help of her kindly yet firm teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton), Precious soon begins to actually enjoy school, learn things and even express her most private thoughts through her daily journal writings which Ms. Rain comments on and then returns to Precious as she does with all her other students. Precious starts smiling, too! Things develop over time as Precious' second baby is closer and closer to being born; events come her way both good and bad.

This film, as I stated above, is outstanding for many reasons; but if I had to isolate just one thing that shines the brightest about it, that one thing would have to be the acting. I have rarely seen anyone--anyone--give such a strong, convincing performance as Mo'Nique who truly deserves an Oscar, as does Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe who plays Precious. Look also for great performances by Lenny Kravitz as a male nurse and Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss, a welfare social worker.

Fans of the actors in this picture will want to see this; and anyone interested in the issues explored in this film would do well to see it and add it to their collections when it is released on DVD. This film's a winner; and I highly recommend it.",1260576000,2,2833,4.809034907597536
4106235,3,B003BEDAVS,"With the many nominations and awards Precious is likely to receive this year, I'm fairly confident ""feel-good movie of the year"" won't be one of them.  This film pulls no punches, and given the path it could have taken in trying to gloss up bleak and violent subject matter into a more thrilling and stylized type drama (see Slumdog Millionaire), I commend this movie for sticking to its guns.

  The driving force behind this movie is the unyielding performance of Mo'Nique, who plays Precious's verbally and physically abusive mother, Mary. I would be very surprised not to see her name in the Best Supporting Actress ballot this year. Gabourey Sidibe, in the role of Precious, also delivers a tender and heartbreaking performance as an obese, illiterate 16-year old who has suffered from a lifetime of brutality and neglect.  Even Mariah Carey (yes, that Mariah Carey) does a very good job in her small role as a sympathetic yet hard-nosed social worker trying to get Precious to finally open up about her violent and trauma filled home life.

  It's some of the little things in this film that really make it work. For instance, there is a scene about halfway through the film where Precious is sitting in her hospital room after recently giving birth to her second child. Her life outlook at this point is nothing short of dreadful, yet surrounded by her friends from class and her doctor who proves to be one of the few people in her life who actually care about her, Precious seems to be genuinely happy for the first time in her life.

  While Lee Daniels directing proves to be very erratic at times, the strengths of lead performances are what really carry this movie along. While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece like many other seem to be doing, Precious is still a very good film that takes a gritty and honest look into the life of a child succumbed to a lifetime of physical and mental abuse.

4106237,4,B003BEDAVS,"To my surprise, this soul-baring 2009 drama is neither as painful nor depressing as the subject matter would imply. In fact, director Lee Daniels' treatment alternates so fluently between gritty realism, social uplift, and fanciful episodes of fantasy that the end result is as much enthralling as it is emotionally draining. First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher does a solid job adapting the 1996 source novel by Sapphire,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Push/dp/0307474844/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Push</a>, but the strength and honesty of the cast is what sears in the memory. Daniels could have been otherwise charged with stunt casting had he not drawn out such powerhouse work from the out-of-left-field likes of comedienne Mo'Nique and pop diva Mariah Carey. Granted Daniels in his second directorial effort is not the most subtle of filmmakers (his first film was the strangely exotic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadowboxer/dp/B000HRMAUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadowboxer</a>), but he does bring a level of florid passion that the subject desperately needs to alleviate the unrelenting bleakness of the title character's existence.

Set in Harlem in 1987, the story centers on sixteen-year-old Claireece ""Precious"" Jones, a morbidly obese girl so void of self-worth that she refers to herself without irony as ""ugly black grease to be washed from the street"". Nearly illiterate, she finds herself pregnant for the second time by her father, and the school principal arranges to enroll Precious at an ""alternative"" institution. She recognizes this as an opportunity to better herself, but her mother Mary discourages it and forces Precious to apply for welfare. The unenviable mother-daughter relationship is the crux of the film, and it is here the film gives an unblinking  account of monstrous physical and psychological abuse that explains the sharp contrast between Precious' inner and outer lives. On the outside, she is a forlorn yet formidable presence with a face so full that she can't express emotion without a great deal of effort. On the inside, she is loved and admired unconditionally. The two slowly come together at Precious' new school where she finds acceptance and redemption through a dedicated teacher (improbably named Blu Rain), who must get through to a classroom full of girls all disadvantaged in their own ways.

The birth of Precious' son, along with the bonding she feels at school, signals a harrowing showdown between mother and daughter and ultimately a confrontation between Mary and Mrs. Weiss, the no-nonsense social worker who seeks the truth behind Precious' home life. In the title role, Gabourey Sidibe is ideally cast given the film's semi-documentary approach. An untrained actress, she is able to elicit empathy by giving herself completely to the inchoate character, and when Precious breaks down from the weight of yet another seemingly insurmountable development, Sidibe gives the scene a halting honesty. Paula Patton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swing-Vote/dp/B001ILFUBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swing Vote</a>) gets to play the Sidney Poitier role of the elegantly transformative teacher as Ms. Rain, but she gives the too-good-to-be-true character a palpable sense of passion. As Mrs. Weiss, a role originally slated for Helen Mirren (who co-starred in Daniels' ""Shadowboxer""), Mariah Carey, bereft of her glistening make-up and diva mannerisms, brings an audacious toughness to her smallish but pivotal role.

However, it is Mo'Nique (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phat-Girlz/dp/B000FUH35U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phat Girlz</a>) who gives the film's most shattering performance. I don't know what emotional reservoir she is tapping into, but she nails Mary with a fury so startling and realistic that it's impossible to trivialize the source of her villainy. She never compromises the hardness in her character, and her self-justifying monologue is an impressive piece of work. There is also solid work from a couple of other unusually cast performers, comedienne Sherri Shepherd (of the morning TV talkfest ""The View"") as a tough school administrator aptly named Cornrows and Lenny Kravitz as a sympathetic male nurse, and a scene-stealing turn from Xosha Roquemore as the ebullient Joann (""My favorite color is florescent beige""). Not all of Daniels' left-turn devices work, for instance, using Sophia Loren's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Women/dp/B0002PYSYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Women</a>&nbsp;as the basis of one of Precious' fantasies seems contrived given only a die-hard cineaste would understand the connection. Regardless, it's no wonder that Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry put their stamp of approval on the film as executive producers since Precious ultimately finds a personal triumph despite the hand life has dealt her.",1259971200,53,5041,6.1158192090395485
4106238,4,B003BEDAVS,"Rarely does a film come along with such convicing, raw power as ""Precious"" has at its disposal. It is not suited for children by any means, but those avoiding the film because of its graphic violence and the grim realities it depicts are doing themselves a disservice. Is this escapism? Certainly not. The performances by Gabourney Sidibe and Mo'Nique are so stirring, so emotionally resonant, that they linger over your memory and refuse to leave it. Never since Angela Lansbury's scheming, positively evil mother in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" has there been a more frightening female supporting character in an American drama film than Mo'Nique's turn as Precious' bitter, beyond-the-borderline mother Mary. The foreboding presence and resulting despair she brings to ""Precious"" is positively gut-wrenching and horrifying. It is a performance for the ages that absolutely must win the Oscar if the integrity of the film academy is to be maintained. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey also put in stark, genuine turns as women invested in helping turn Precious' life around. To accomplish this, though, Precious must first believe in herself, her dreams and her future, with or without the light-skinned boy she fantasizes about to escape the pain of day-to-day life. Lee Daniels' direction is a little uneven and jarringly paced, but his ability to capture such moving performances and linger over the most crucial scenes gives ""Precious"" the added depth and dimension it needs to reach the level of greatness. This is hands down the best American drama film of 2009 and a surefire contender for the Academy Award for Best Picture.",1259539200,4,1628,5.193916349809886
4106239,3,B003BEDAVS,"Two absolutely blistering performances make PRECIOUS a must-see movie...despite many other flaws.  In fact, were it not for the work of Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique, I would probably not recommend the film.

PRECIOUS plays something like the most brutal, graphic Afterschool Special you could imagine.  It tells the story of 16-year-old Precious, a morbidly obese girl who is already the mother of one child (with Down Syndrome) and another on the way.  Both children were fathered by HER father.  She lives with her mother, Mary...the most frightening, abuse, foul-mouthed and dark-hearted mother since...well, I can't remember when.  Precious gets a chance to enroll in an alternative school, and through the kindness of her new teacher and the support of some new friends, Precious begins to blossom a bit.  She tries to tear away from her mother, gain enough confidence in herself and be a good mother for her kids.

This is all set against some of the most squalid living conditions we've ever seen that take place in America.  Precious and Mary live in a cramped apartment, funding purely by welfare checks.  Mary, in fact, rarely ventures beyond the walls of her apartment.  She stews in front of the TV, awash in bile and anger...waiting for Precious to come home from school to cook her dinner and bear the brunt of her wrath.  Even the alternative school Precious attends is in a run down apartment building that anyone would be afraid to send their child to.

While the movie is full of shocking moments (none more than the frequent outbursts of violence from Mary), the story still plays out VERY predictably.  Precious just needs a little confidence and love to start blossoming.  Education will save her.  Her classmates are a generically wacky bunch of troubled teens...really just all good kids on the inside.  Her teacher seems to literally glow with goodness (and she's a lesbian in a healthy, loving relationship).  Her welfare caseworker is tough but fair.  When she goes into labor, her male nurse is a handsome, sensitive hunk.  Even the daydreams Precious has (sadly, mostly when she's being raped or pushed around) seem generic...dreams of stardom and flashy clothes.

I don't mean to demean the plight of Precious and people like her.  Despite my seeming cynicism, there were still many moments of power in the film that had me gasping or shaking my head in utter disbelief.  But so much of the ""bad things"" that happened in the film seemed generic, and most of the minor characters suffered from that as well.  They were one-dimensional, stock characters.  Imagine the kids from WELCOME BACK KOTTER if they could curse like crazy.

The direction of Lee Daniels is very vague as well.  He sometimes doesn't have a good grip on the way people are related to each other in a space.  Some of the scenes have an almost documentary style (probably right for this story), but others have fanciful camera angles, soft focus and unnecessary trickery...to remind us we're seeing a film.

But what Daniels has managed to do well is hardly insignificant.  He's assembled a cast that clearly feels VERY strongly about the material, and most of them handle their assignments well.  Paula Patton plays the teacher fairly well, although Daniels insists on keeping her in a soft focus that reminded me of nothing more than the way William Shatner's Captain Kirk so often had a glow to him on TV.  Her character was written to be something close to a saint...far too generic.  But Patton does well with what she has.  Mariah Carey (star of GLITTER!) is more than credible as Mrs. Weiss, the welfare case worker.  She has just a few scenes, and she handles all of them in an admirably understated way.  She isn't really a character but a device...yet we see glimpses of who this lady might be.  She has humor and toughness in a combination I wouldn't have expected Carey to be able to pull off.  I have to give credit where it is due.

Gabourey Sidibe is a newcomer to acting, but she is SO convincing as Precious, you can forgive those audience members who have apparently thought this film was someone autobiographical.  I know NOTHING about this young lady...but she certainly gives us a fully realized portrayal.  She has no gloss to her at all.  Sometimes she mumbles and is difficult to understand...JUST LIKE many teenagers I know!  She is capable of great self-pity (certainly earned) but also great charm.  We can palpably feel Precious trying to claw her way into a better life.  The odds are stacked against her (there are even more roadblocks I haven't spoiled for you)...but she is able to envision herself providing love and care to her kids.

However, it is Mo'Nique who is a virtual lock for an Oscar-nomination.  She is a shockingly horrible mother and human being.  To say she is full of anger is a major understatement.  While her part is written in a cardboard fashion (she's almost like an inner-city wicked stepmother from a fairy tale)...the actress elevates every moment on screen.  She is riveting to watch because you literally don't know what she'll do next...except you know it'll be horrible.  Her every utterance is filled with animal cunning, and I mean that.  She is a deeply unintelligent and uneducated woman who has a survival instinct that is terrifying.  And she would gladly sacrifice anyone or anything.  She is a creature utterly without dignity and utterly without redeeming qualities.  She knows this, and wears it as a warped badge of honor.  All of this would have been good enough to burn this performance in my memory...but Mo'Nique's final scene, where she bares her dark soul and her motivation takes this to another level.  I felt all the air sucked out of the theatre as we collectively gasped in disbelief at the depths of delusion and loathing this character operated under.

For these two performances, PRECIOUS is well-worth seeing.  And you may find yourself falling more under the spell of the film overall than I did...in which case, you'll find this one of the year's best films.  For me, it is an interesting failure...made compelling by two of the best performances I've seen this year.",1259539200,11,6153,4.853986551392891
4106240,5,B003BEDAVS,This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is a movie about rising above and redemption but it is not false or sentimental at all. The story and characters feel real. I almost feel like I was watching a reality show about a girl from Harlem. The acting was phenominal. The movie is about a 16 year old incest survivor from Harlem who is pregnant with her second child by her father. Her first suffers Downs Syndrome and is being cared for by her grandmother except on days when the welfare worker makes a home visit. The best acting comes from Monique who plays Precious abusive mother. The scene where she breaks down in the welfare office is unforgetable. This film will win awards on Oscar night. If I could give more stars I would.,1259366400,4,755,4.323943661971831
4106241,4,B003BEDAVS,"Twenty minutes into this film, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at all. It was setting itself up as the ""teacher helps an inner city kid"" type of film, which has been overdone. I was very wrong. This is a film about a young girl with big dreams, and little else, as well as the ability to find and help yourself.

Gabourey ""Gabbie"" Sidibe portrays Claireece ""Precious"" Jones, a teenager growing up in Harlem with an abusive mother, no father, learning disabilities, one child of her own, and one on the way. The viewer learns early on that this is NOT the feel-good movie of the year.

Siddons is more than adequate in her role, but this movie, acting-wise, belongs to Monique. Her portrayal of Precious' mother invokes a wide range of emotions from the audience, and she was arguably the most memorable part of this movie. I will go on record as saying that Monique has probably locked up her Best Supporting Actress nomination for Oscar night, 2010.

Gritty yet realistic, 'Precious' is a film that I think could be enjoyed by most adults. Despite its unnecessarily long title, I believe this movie has begun to find its audience, and I hope that it continues to do so.",1259366400,3,1178,4.52112676056338
4106242,4,B003BEDAVS,"Precious takes you on an emotional journey that you will not likely forget. There are some remarkable performances but the only one that stands out is Monique's character. She plays an abusive mother that knowingly let her daughter be molested. She actually blames Precious for her man leaving. She is so full of self hatred and anger it's hard to see how Precious has survived this long. The young lady playing Precious does a great job of portraying how broken Precious is. Precious's imagination is the only thing that gives her a break from all the abuse. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Precious. Mariah Carey  has a small part in this movie. Her acting skills have improved but wow she looks really old without makeup. Some people will go to see this thinking that it's one of those inspirational movies. This is not one of those movies where at the end something positive happens and things start to look up for the main character. Things look even worse for Precious at the end of this film. Please keep an open mind. I actually wanted to give this movie 5 stars but it feels unfinished. You feel a little cheated at the end of the movie because nothing is resolved. However, Precious is easily one of the most captivating films i've seen in awhile. Not only is this one a Must See, you have to buy this one. It will be a welcomed edition to my dvd collection.
