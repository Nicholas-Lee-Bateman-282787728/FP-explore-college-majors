8338229,1,B001RLU9JS,Ordered the Cardio Resistance Band workout but on the actual DVD it was a stability ball routine which we actually liked a lot.  Not the seller's fault as the DVD matches the cover info but it just isn't.  Totally mislabeled product.  Oh well.  I have to give it a one star so buyers don't try to order the resistance band workout unless they read the reviews and discover the problem.,1407715200,,385,4.457142857142857
8338230,5,B001RLU9JS,Thanks.,1404345600,,7,7.0
8338231,2,B001RLU9JS,Unfortunatly I didn't get to try the cardio workout with resistance bands because that was not the DVD included in the box. The box and the DVD itself both say resistance bands on them but the DVD is of a big ball work out.,1401926400,,223,4.090909090909091
8338232,1,B001RLU9JS,"I ordered this once even tho other people got the wrong disc. I hoped I would be lucky, nope. The box and disc have a picture of the resistance band workout, but the file on the disc is a balance ball workout. I returned the first one and received the second one, same problem. Sad, it looked like a good resistance band workout. If they fix the problem, they should put an announcement on the page, otherwise, DON""T ORDER THIS! No resistance bands are included, even tho the box says there is. Sad.",1395100800,4,499,4.376344086021505
8338233,1,B001RLU9JS,"Ordered it hoping to get the right one. No Good. Wrong disc, the balance ball one is in it. No resistance band included :(
They are sending another, but I'll bet its wrong as well. DON""T ORDER THIS. ITS the WRONG DISC!",1394841600,,218,4.214285714285714
8338234,1,B001RLU9JS,The DVD comes in a package with a label that says it's the Cardio Resistance Band program - but when you play it it's for a STABILITY BALL program with a different instructor (Katalin Rodriquez-Zamiar).,1359158400,,202,4.8
8338235,1,B001RLU9JS,I too ordered this DVD to get a cardio workout with the resistance band and got a DVD for ball exercises. The DVD was labeled correctly and even included a band. I returned it for a refund.,1359158400,,189,4.135135135135135
8338236,1,B001RLU9JS,"Though the DVD was labeled correctly, it turned out to be the wrong show; showing some kind of workout with a ball rather than resistance bands.  I would have returned the DVD if I had had time to repackage it and run to the post office.  As it was, I just chunked it.",1311379200,,268,4.037735849056604
8338237,4,B001RLU9JS,"I originally got this to get more ideas for working out my abs with a resistance band. I currently use the Gaiam's Medium resistance band workout with their DVD, that has Tanja leading the workouts. I love that DVD and love the core/ab section, but wanted something that included some cardio and more ideas for my abs and the band. This video is great for cardio, and though it's low impact, you still break a sweat since the cardio is throughout the whole video. I was unhappy with the ab section of this video, it didn't even include using the band for the ab exercises, but the rest of the video you did use the band and with the cardio used in addition, does make for a great workout. If you do the whole video, it's about 30 minutes long, and you can also pick one exercise segment to do if you do not have time to do it all at once. I will keep this for the cardio aspect and for the use of the band for all of the other muscle groups (such as back, upper and lower body), but I do find it unfair and misleading to say that your abs will get a workout. This will be one of those videos that will be good for mixing up your routine, and for me to pick and choose for getting a cardio workout and still using the other DVD I mentioned for my core/abs. I should also mention, like other reviews I've read online, the woman pictured on the front of the DVD is actually not the person who is on the DVD. The one who is on the DVD does good, but will probably be tricky for your first time around because she's not good at telling you which movement she'll be doing next or how to do it, but you'll get the hang of it.",1306108800,5,1618,4.059375
