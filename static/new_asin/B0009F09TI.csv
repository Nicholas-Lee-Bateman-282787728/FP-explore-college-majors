8059906,5,B0009F09TI,"This is one of a series of ten DVD's. I found this to be a real collector's item. The picture quality is great given the fact that even though the picture has been restored you can see the limitations of the source matterial. The sound ia A+ given the fact that it is mono only because most shows back then were not made for stereo broadcast at that time period. But What makes this a real collector's item is the fact that it includes the final musical number, ""You've Got a Friend"" (I'm assuming this is the famed James Taylor song) performed by Vincent and the Muppet monsters. Apparently, this is missing from this episode on one of Disney's Muppet Show Season One discs.",1123372800,19,675,4.451612903225806
