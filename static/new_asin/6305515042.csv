1048806,5,6305515042,"This film has been treated unfairly with the critics. They say that it is a bland riff on ""E.T."" It isn't! Not half as much as ""Mac and Me"". This really so much like the real story of Sasquatch  (""wild man of the woods"") or ""Bigfoot"". They see traces  of him. They take a pcture of him. And even find his footprints. I beleive  that Bigfoot is some undiscovered decendent of the Gigantapithicis. And the  Loch Ness Monster is (now, you may turn pale, if you like) a surviving  DINOSAUR! And So what if the people all have blue, green, purple and orange  skin and speak in either monotone or whiny voices. And it IS very funny!  The scenes with Rodger and his robot and ""Looks like clean underwear,  sir"".",964569600,2,704,4.361538461538461
1048807,4,6305515042,"I think it was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I think it has a good story, but predictable.  I also think the price should be cheaper(the movie  is only 1hr. 30min.)",941328000,,169,4.1875
1048877,5,6305515042,I grew up on Doug from nick to disney I was a fan. I am still called Doug Funny to this day. And I had been dying to find this movie on dvd and here it is. Its still just as good as I remember it.,1354060800,3,196,3.282608695652174
1048878,3,6305515042,"I was a committed viewer of the cartoon series ""Doug"" as a child. Believe it or not, I adored--and still adore--both the Nickelodeon and Disney versions, even though the former is clearly superior to the latter. Not surprisingly, I found a lot to like about the feature-length film ""Doug's 1st Movie,"" which unfortunately was also Doug's last movie. It has taken 12 long years, but finally Disney has made the effort to put this underrated little gem of a movie out on DVD; for a long while, we had to settle with the VHS version. So the good news is that ""Doug's 1st Movie"" has finally received an official DVD release; the bad news is that it doesn't fare much better than the old VHS tape.

While the movie is good, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. First of all, we do not get treated to a wide-screen presentation; the DVD's aspect ratio is full-frame, even though it teases us with a wide-screen opening/scene selection menu. At first, I wondered if maybe ""Doug's 1st Movie,"" originally intended to be a straight-to-video release, was animated in the full-screen format. But then I remembered that now seldom-seen disclaimer at the beginning of the VHS version, which stated ""the picture has been modified to fit your screen,"" meaning there was a wide-screen print and it has not been seen since 1999. Nevertheless, the picture quality is very fine; the colors are vibrant just as in the show; the sound is clear and well-balance. And the entire film is present. The only lapse is that, for some reason, the end credits have been sped up, so we only get to hear about 2/3s of that wonderful, touching song ""Someone Like Me."" That's a shame.

But here is the other big question about the DVD release: what is there for additional content. Well, as much as I would like to report that it is loaded with bonus features, it is utterly devoid of them. There is no theatrical trailer, no commentaries, not even the ""DOUGumentary"" that was featured at the end of the old VHS tape. What really surprised me--as this would have doubled sales for this DVD since the only ones who would buy this film are those who remembered the show from their childhood--is that there are no episodes of ""Disney's Doug"" included as special features. We get the movie and that is all.

Admittedly, it is great to have ""Doug's 1st Movie"" on DVD, and I am glad that Disney put up the money to do it. I was just hoping for a little more from this as far as video presentation and content was concerned. But if you have no itching desire to own this film on DVD (or if you have the VHS tape and a tape-to-digital software), there is no real need to rush to get it.",1347148800,,2642,4.5
1048879,1,6305515042,The whole cast is bland & boring and so is the story itself. It's like watching the Captain Planet show. The female mayor does little-to-nothing to help Doug and the lake monster or even stopping the villain for that matter. The lake monster is bland & forgettable at best. It's like a very long bad episode:too long for it's own good. It has a ton of stupid moments like dressing the lake monster as a girl. How can anyone not see that the girl is really the lake monster? It also has weird plot points. The only likeable cast member in the whole film is the Robot Nanny. The animation itself is not great but pretty good. I give this film a 1 out of 10.,1320451200,2,655,4.2063492063492065
1048880,2,6305515042,"The VHS I bought was nice and cheap. Shipping was decent. It was true to the description that it was never opened and still wrapped, it even still had a sticker coupon on the front for like a dollar off Easy Mac or something that expired in 2001.

The movie itself is not great. It REALLY IS nothing like the old Nickelodeon Doug we all love. It feels empty and the characters are different and there's really no heart.

I still welcome it into my collection.",1238112000,2,459,4.325581395348837
1048881,5,6305515042,"Watching this movie brought back a lot of fun memories of how Nickleoden use to be. I miss those older shows and wish that they would put them back on the air. I am glad that this movie was avaialble on Amazon. I plan to collect all that I can, so that my grandchildren can enjoy them as I have.",1218153600,,295,3.933333333333333

This other movie that shood be seen by MST3000. I wounder they understand this movie.",1090022400,3,263,4.076923076923077
1048883,5,6305515042,"I loved this movie. I'm very upset that they no longer make it because that means alot of people won't be able to see it! It was great. You don't have to be a close follower of the show to like it. Doug and his pal Skeeter have always thought that there was something living in the polluted Lucky Duck Lake. But when they actually find the monster that lives there, it turns out to be more than they can handel. Patty, Doug's love intrest, is always hanging around with an upper classman who works with her on decorating for the valentines day dance. When Doug tries to tell Patty about the monster, she accuses him of lying. Whats worse is that Mr. Bluff, the owner of Doug's hometown, Bluffington, wants to capture the monster so that there is no proof that he has polluted Lucky Duck Lake. Now doug has to save his monster friend, get Patty back on his side, and save the day! You would love it if you saw it. I hope a store near you has a copy that hasn't been sold yet because you don't want to miss this!",985392000,5,1010,4.184615384615385

They did the TV version of the ending credit, and they did not play the whole song of Someone Like Me, or Deep Deep Water. Like the did on the VHS version. Also, no special features like the behind the scenes segment. Still, this did bring back my childhood, and I enjoyed watching again!",1442707200,,352,4.268656716417911

7891772,5,6305515042,"Even before the entire Nicktoon version of Doug was completed in 1 DVD set in 2014, the only part of his Disneytoon run on DVD is Doug's 1st (and only) Movie. It was originally called The First Doug Movie Ever!, and would be straight to VHS in 1999, but Disney changed its mind and put it in theatres first, then on VHS that same year, and on DVD (only through the Disney Movie Club) in 2012. The Tigger Movie and Planes 1 went through similar treatment; originally as straight-to-video releases, but then changed to be in theatres first in 2000 and 2013. The Monster of Lucky Duck Lake is finally revealed as a Neematoadasaurus in this movie, and Doug and Skeeter try to prove his existence, especially in order to get Patti Mayonnaise to finally be Doug's gal in time for Bluffington Middle School's dance. Call Doug's Disneytoon era what you may, there's still lots of people longing to have it on DVD, not just me and aside from this movie. Somehow, the end credits were sped up a little compared to the original VHS release, and the movie wasn't presented in its original Widescreen format, only in Fullscreen; and this is a Disney Movie Club Exclusive release, like DuckTales The Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp used to be from 2006 to 2015, and it was in a widescreen format itself back then and right now, now that it's out everywhere. Sadly, there's no bonus features in this DVD, not even the ""DOUGumentary"" at the end of the original VHS release. If only Disney would listen to us and put out more classic Disneytoon shows on DVD, even Doug's Disneytoon era, and the remaining episodes of shows like Goof Troop, DuckTales, Darkwing Duck, Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers, and The Gummi Bears. You never know what Disney will put out on home video next!",1440028800,2,1760,4.59047619047619
