1784244,1,B00006L975,"I was sucked in by the DVD box. Possibly the worst movie I've ever rented. For those of you who kind of liked it, more power to you :)

I seemed like a high school media arts production. Needless to say my ears were assaulted by the fake accents. I'm sure some of the budget would have been better spent getting acting lessons for the ""actors"". I couldn't even get through the first 30mins. I shut if off after that point.",1094860800,,422,4.209876543209877
1784245,2,B00006L975,"The movie is bad... poorly acted... storyline is nothing new of course... There is something to be said for the cinematography, it's not standard b grade... it's actually pretty good... but yes... unless you're like me and willing to spend an hour and a half on watching a pointless movie that gives little or no gratification, by all means, rent it or buy it... To call this the worst movie ever is unfair... it's not entertaining enough to be the worst movie ever...",1086220800,,468,4.650602409638554
1784246,3,B00006L975,"Well considering that this flick was something that my film group got out for a ""bad movie marathon"" I really wasn't expecting that much, and indeed there were some compleatly cornball lines and bad acting.
However, the film was still interesting enough to make me want to see it again, MINUS, the friends doing the MST3000 impression in the back ground.
So I did, and what I found when I was acutally able to watch sans people threateing the one who brought it with wild dingos, was a rather compleing film.
For a group of people who are doing this as a first attempt at film making it's a good start. The actors seem to be new at it, but they give good performances in most places, and there are some sceens that make one cringe not in their cheezball natuer but in horror like and good vamp flick should.
Its also a good display of how indpendants can get what the want on the screen if they really want to bad enough.
So to sum this all up, I wouldnt tell you to go out of your way to find this film. But if you happen to spot it on the 8.99 rack at your local wally world then get it. If nothing else it's commentary is a good instruction book on how to get your own film makeing carreer going of you are an aspiering director.",1085356800,,1232,4.180672268907563
1784247,3,B00006L975,"This movie got a lot of bad reviews, probably because everyone paid too much for it. It is definately one for the bargin bin, but if you are a collector,  as I, then it's worth having in your collection. Don't exect spectaular effects, it's pretty much just a half step above a B movie. If your strickly into vampires, then you probably won't like it, but if you like Sci-Fi, then it's passible. It's true, the dialouge is terrible and some of the acting is pretty amature, but for the price (I got mine under 6 bucks) and if you like B movies, then it's cool. For a low budget the special effects aren't bad. The stroy line's a bit funny, because it seems to take parts from different movies, like the kevlar suit seems to come straight out of Batman, and the sword fight, from Highlander. If you don't mind low buget, brainless, entertainment, then it's ok.",1066003200,,859,4.436708860759493
1784248,1,B00006L975,"Hmm, what can I say about this movie apart from that it's best to avoid it like the plague? Unfortunately this is just one in a long line of vampire movies I have watched and been utterly disappointed by. It seems that many movies of this genre start out with a good premise but fail to deliver the goods and this movie is an outstanding example. The script and acting are incredibly poor and at times so ridiculous you have to laugh. It's obvious they didn't have a big budget for this movie, but honestly, is there any point in making a vampire movie if you're going to shoot the whole thing during the day because you can't afford to shoot it at night?",1048809600,2,655,4.290322580645161
1784249,3,B00006L975,"I found this film to be entertaining on a number of levels and find some of the reviews posted on this site rather harsh and quite uninformed. If you watch the making of supplied on the DVD you see that the cameras used in production were actually literally domestic digital cameras not the Lucas-film types as mentioned below. Also the filmmakers actually mention that this matrix-like ""look"" was initially used in an ACS award winning short they did 2 years before the release of Blade! I love when peoples mouths get to fourth gear while their brains are in neutral!  I personally emailed the filmmakers to let them know how great I thought it was that they made this film themselves. It is quite a competent and enjoyable product with a sequel in pre-production Yay! It is a totally Australian independent production and has nothing to do with the garbage coming out of Hollywood as another reviewer seems to think. If you're interested in low budget filmmaking like I am then watch this film even for educational purposes as it is beautifully shot if nothing else!",1044489600,,1069,4.747311827956989
1784250,1,B00006L975,"I rented this expecting a mildly entertaining vampire/horror movie. The box artwork and description sure made it sound interesting. It tries to be a combination of ""Blade"" and ""The Matrix"" at once and fails miserably on both goals.
Very poorly executed in almost every possible way. It was apparently shot on a similar Sony digital camera system that Lucas used on the last Star Wars movie. But the picture on this film is only decent and looks quite fake and bright. In other words, it looks as if it was shot on digital video. Why they even bothered with that amazes me since this was obviously a very low-budget movie to begin with. The sound is also very poorly done, i could not even understand most of the dialogue throughout the film. We are talking about a very rough sound mix.
Even a really bad Troma movie is Godly compared to this piece of cinematic garbage! Too bad there isn't a 0 rating on here.",1042934400,,910,4.5212121212121215
1784251,1,B00006L975,"For a pure definition of bad, this film is it. Bad acting, bad storylines, bad everything. I sat and watched this movie and was awestruck that producers actually put money to this film. No wonder hollywood is getting bankrupt!!
This film is the one too rent/buy if the unwanted guest is coming round for a visit, guaranteed they will be gone in the first 10 minutes maximum.",1042416000,2,374,4.597014925373134
1784252,1,B00006L975,"I saw this movie at the video store and thought, cool another vampire movie. Man what a waste of money. Grainy, badly done filming, over 95% of the movie was dubbed over instead of actually having the actors act. You can see the wires attacted to the actors when they are yanked backwards after a fake punch. And the plot stunk. It was a combo of Blade wannabe, Blair witch-ish documentary style and other stuff. The main character started out cool but turns out to be a real dork. And the villian. oh please, he looked like a reject from the a B-movie vampire movie. At least some B-Movies are funny to watch. This one is like a terrible carwreck. Don't waste your money. If I could give this movie a 0 I would.",1041552000,,712,4.32089552238806
1784253,1,B00006L975,"We rented this one on VHS tonight, and...it's just BAD.  If you rent this movie, you can expect to see:
The best Acting/Directing/Writing/Producing hat trick since ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""
The worst fake Texas (Arkansas?  Generic American Redneck?) accent ever;
A six minute long (!) expositional monologue about how HIV, Carbon Monoxide, evolution and Vampires are all related;
The first kevlar bullet-proof vest ever conceived, designed and delivered in 10 seconds, which naturally enhances the male bosom;
The best semi-high speed rented car chase ever;
Eminiem's dramatic portrayal of a gay vampire;
The use of photoshop-level special effects to create fake gun flashes;
Proof that watching too much Highlander or playing too many roleplaying games can adversely affect your filmmaking skills;
The quickest recovery from a gunshot to the knee in movie history;
A chance to play 'spot the wire' with your friends;
Fake blood...now!  Okay, more.  I said more!  MORE!!!
and 'We can't afford explosions but we can use dramatic lighting to imply them'.
The scenes filmed in the real molecular biology lab took countless MINUTES away from the search for a cure to MS, or HIV, or, or, Psoriasis, and the producers, directors, actors and writers (all one person!) should pay with their (his) life.
Happy New Year!  Word to my undead molecular biology homies!  Ed out.
*Note that no real Eminems were used in the making of this movie.",1041292800,2,1431,5.115879828326181
7971234,4,B00006L975,"In this movie Vampirism is a Mutagenic Virus.  For centuries Vampires ruled the Human Race.  The Noble Class was literally Blood Drinkers.  But eventually that ended.

Humans had unknowingly crippled Vampires's advantages.  Antibiotics and other anti-viral substances had given humans an immunity to Vampirism.  They could no longer turn humans into vamps.  No matter how long they live, a species that can't reproduce is doomed.  Also all remaining vampires were centuries old.  They were turned long before the pollutants had been unleashed upon the Earth.  The bodies hadn't any resistance to Airborne Toxins.

The Vamps were dying and helpless.  Their only hope was to evolve.  Gene therapy and DNA research was their last chance.  They wanted to genetically develop a New Breed of Vampire.

The main character is Michael.  At the beginning he's a scientist working on the Vamps Gene Project.  Then he was accidentally exposed to his own creation.  Michael had a scientist's prejudices, he believed vampires were a myth - so it took until near the end of the movie for him to connect vampires to his work.  He spent most of movie calling himself a freak.

As the New Breed, Michael became immune to sunlight and stakes.  He had inhuman strength, heightened senses, and rapid healing.  But the blood lust was also his.  He spends most of the movie hunted by those who'd once been his colleagues and mercenaries employed by the few remaining pure blood vampires.  He learned how live on the streets, and how take what he needed.

Michael eventually turns from scientist to warrior.  He declares war on those who'd been hunting him.  Then goes to confront the pure vamps.  He faces them garbed like someone from the Underworld Series, while they looked like vamps from Dracula Movies.  The past battled the present, for control of the future.",1497052800,,1843,4.970394736842105
7971235,4,B00006L975,It's a good low budget film. Acting sucks bt the story to the movie could of been better. I still find this movie to be entertaining to me,1434931200,,138,3.9642857142857144
7971236,1,B00006L975,"I adore the vampire genre; I'm used to keeping my expectations in check so that I can sit through just about anything in hopes it might have some redeeming qualities. Sadly, this was a waste of my time. I'm glad I got it through Netflix so I can't actually pin a precise dollar value to the disappointment.

Best thing about the movie: as another reviewer touched on, man-candy. Attractive, well-built (sometimes shirtless) boys playing with swords, sticks, guns and occasional grappling.  But that is less than 5% of the movie, so it really isn't a strong enough point to recommend it.

Worst things about the movie: the plot, the lack of plot, the bad acting, the terrible script, the goofy special effects.  At 90 minutes, it was way too long. But it wasn't even 90 minutes: the first 3.5 minutes and the last 5 were credits rolling.  Subtract another minute or so from longest female performance in the movie (a gal in a suit and heels screaming, panting, and running away from a 'monster') and we're down to 80 minutes of ""is it over yet?""

The movie seemed to be 1) framing for a long speech at the end of the movie from the evil vampire that ties together HIV, climate change, and why vampires are dying out; and 2) an excuse for the filmmakers to get their friends together so they can practice their fake accents to yell lines at each other while wearing the bitching-awesomest costumes.  If conceived by adolescents, the plot probably would probably be middle-of-the-road in a high school drama class.  But these are grown men who are gleefully writing, directing, producing, and acting in their little project.  Or maybe I'm wrong and most microbiologists keep guns and swords at home.

Some reviewers have said the director's commentary offers valuable insight to budding filmmakers.  Sorry, I already wasted 90 minutes of my life watching the movie; I'm not about to volunteer another hour and a half. And it isn't even bad in the way a B movie is often bad... the only thing that made me groan was the ridiculous attempt at a car chase. The rest was just lackluster dreadful.",1251331200,,2089,4.695890410958904
7971237,1,B00006L975,"I am a vampire geek. Love Buffy, Angel, Blade, etc, but I couldn't even make it all the way through this movie. It was boring, badly acted, badly written, poorly filmed and a waste of money. The premise had potential, (Viral vampirism) but was done MUCH better in 28 days, which I loved, even though technically not a vampire movie. Selling my copy at a yard sale next summer.",1191110400,,376,4.463768115942029
7971238,3,B00006L975,"and this is one of the Bs that I liked.  Ok, I'm a sucker (pardon the pun) for vamp flixs and novels (jeanclaude from anita blake is among my top 3 fave vamps). When I saw the movie at a local BB, I decided to give it a try.  Well, the accents kindof gave it away that its not american, and that dude's supposed Texan/Ark/LA/MS accent made me laugh at times. not because its cheezy, but yes I actually know people who talk like that. The low budget was apparent from the beginning, the storyline wasn't top notch, but I thought it was a pretty decent B-movie. I just wish that the ending had a better way of closing the movie and not left me hanging with the 'what if'. If you want 'typical hollywood' boring vamps rent Interview with a vampire. If you're into the B's give Reign a rental try.",1149465600,,793,4.2105263157894735

7971240,1,B00006L975,"The best thing about this movie is the pic on the cover.  I thought i'd give it a chance, but was sadly disapointed.  The story was borring.  It needed to be fleshed out a lot.  The acting was horable.  The special effects looked like they hired a kindergarden class to do them.  The filming looked to be done with a hand held camcorder.  The only reason it got one star was cause the picture on the cover was good enough to sucker me into renting this.  Do yourself a favor and rent Blade instead.",1117756800,,498,4.223404255319149
7971241,4,B00006L975,"Detailed plot: Michael Dorn, a hired chemist, creates a virus that turns people into artificial vampires (he was working on a cure for HIV).  Dorn is accidentally infected and goes on the run from his employers.  Those same employers, called ""The Counsel"", send a vampire ""half-breed"" and an Ex-Marine with a grudge after Dorn.  Meanwhile, Dorn finds out that the Counsel wanted a virus that made vampires and used the HIV cure as a cover-up, so he begins to systematically destroy everything and everyone involved.

Pros: The plot and the writing is great.  If I could get a Hollywood movie budget and make the same movie with the same script, it would be superb.

Cons: Bad acting (half of the actors have accents, half don't, and only one is good at delivering lines and facial acting), low budget special effects and cameras, cliffhanger ending.

But, to tell the truth, despite the cons, the script really kept me interested and made me stay until the end.  I recommend it for fans of the vampire genre and B movies in general :-)",1114128000,,1035,4.711111111111111
7971242,3,B00006L975,"I kinda enjoyed this one, myself. But I won't say it's a great movie.

It's nice to see a low-budget vampire movie, where the actors wear fangs and black contact lenses instead of rubber demon heads or overdone computer effects. I've always found people scarier than F/X, myself. Still, the UK vampire miniseries ULTRAVIOLET managed with less.

And if you like to watch shirtless well-built young men posing with leather and weapons, well, now's your chance. Yes, late wives are mentioned, and there's nothing blatantly gay, but the only women onscreen are victim cameos, and the men pose a lot.

Mind you, if you want good scriptwriting, acting, or directing, you've probably come to the wrong movie. But it's underdone rather than entertainingly cheesy. Except, of course, for the Australian attempt at a Texas accent in one of the bad guys, but hey, they probably find American attempts at an Australian accent equally funny.

Did I mention directing? It's the same quality as the rest of the show. Picture a climactic scene where the hero stands immobile under the only light in a dark room, while the lead vampire circles around him, gesturing and lecturing, for at least five minutes. Talking heads much? Dynamic it's not.

So if you're looking for a feature movie, you're out of luck. But the quality's about right for a (one-episode) TV show; it's not as bad as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE or suchlike.",1107993600,,1406,4.841666666666667
7971243,1,B00006L975,"It wasn't the corniness that bothered me.  It was the script.  A 5 year old could write better.  The speech was lame, the come backs were childish, and were did those accents come from.  Don't waste your time or money on this on.  You want a B vampire movie, rent Fright Night or The Forsaken.",1098316800,3,293,4.254545454545455
