8596293,4,B00DQEG52O,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary of the culture of Dominica. It is filmed from an internal point of view, with more meaning to those from Dominica. But as an outsider, frequent visitor, I've struggled to understand the complex social fabric of the island, the intensity of the friendly yet rebellious culture that until just a few decades ago had a justified reputation as a place to be very wary as a visitor. Wyatt Bardouille's documentary discusses important themes in Dominica's development, hopefully a meaningful statement for an island where the natural environment remains the most unique and wonderful asset. I give 4 out of 5 stars because it is a bit light on thorough explanation for the foreigner, but as the intended audience is as much Dominicans living abroad, this is understood. Bottom line: Definitely buy it, definitely watch with attention.",1387843200,,866,5.148936170212766
