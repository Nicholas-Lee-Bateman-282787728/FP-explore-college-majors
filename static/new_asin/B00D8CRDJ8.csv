5777205,5,B00D8CRDJ8,"this movie truly shines the way it was advertised. a bit of 'the wire' meets 'the french connection'. very well made, suspense like crazy, ending action shootout was just so damn good, completly out of nowhere from a certain character. best movie ive seen of the underworld in some time. great movie.",1383264000,,300,4.788461538461538
5777206,5,B00D8CRDJ8,"Action thriller movies out of China the past few years are now amongst the best in the world, in a class with the French film industry and certainly surpassing the stereotypic offerings from the US.  This is particularly true for the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing studios. This film had plot elements not seen previously in film with a few twists to provoke the viewer as a bonus thrown in. Script, acting, directing, filming were all well done.",1382572800,2,447,4.730769230769231
5777207,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"A taut and gripping police drama, a harsh look at the Asian drug trade,told thru the eyes of the police using a busted drug cartel leader to lead them down a path of lies and deception, overall that is what this film is about without revealing spoilers and acting like a movie critic,to which I'm not. This is geared towards the action movie fans,especially the ones that miss the John Woo type of films in the past,Love the last 35 minutes of this movie(sheer chaos) all the way to the  harsh ending. A message film that is realistic and entertaining as well. A must see for Johnnie To fans.",1371686400,4,592,4.431192660550459
5777208,2,B00D8CRDJ8,This seemed like a film that didn't give the story enough consideration because over all it lacked suspense and any characters that I could care about. Even the drug deal turned police informant didn't elicit enough pathos in his performance or in the writing for me to care about him. In addition there was a very big shoot out where one of the female cops is shot twice and run over but still she somehow survives. This scene looked like it needed more time in rehearsal to work out the details.,1409097600,,497,4.472527472527473

5777211,5,B00D8CRDJ8,"I really enjoyed this film. First off is that the plot is so very well developed and vastly different for standard hollyweird fare. The acting is very good even given reading subtitles as the plot develops. I can't stand looping in English for oriental films, it just doesn't work for me. One of the most interesting, fascinating, and a little scary things was the way various law enforcement agencies worked together fighting crime. In the US there would be at least a half dozen different departments/agencies involved and not necessarily sharing all the information. Not so here! Extremely efficient! Just a note here of something I really liked. These guys use radios and telephones to communicate. So you don't get just one hero cop who is getting to three or four different locations just in the nick of time. This is a police organization that cooperates with each other. I am pretty sure the ACLU would hate that much information being stored and shared but it does make me think.",1404000000,,988,4.817647058823529
5777212,4,B00D8CRDJ8,I am not one that minds foreign films with subtitles. Some people won't even consider it. It is a small barrier to an otherwise entertaining experience. The story was tight and moved well. The acting was not Hollywood but sometimes that can be a plus.,1396310400,,251,4.6
5777213,4,B00D8CRDJ8,The movie is more a police procedural than action thriller still the final action sequence should satisfy those seeking intense gunfights; the ending reminded me of Expect the Unexpected. I would consider this a minor masterpiece in To's movie cannon.,1394323200,,251,5.3
5777214,2,B00D8CRDJ8,"The movie started well... then, it got worst and worst... dragging on and on... culminating to a totally ridiculous over-the-top ending.",1393545600,,136,5.523809523809524

5777216,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Respected Hong Kong film director Johnnie To makes a film in mainland China for the first time. In Drug War (Du zhan) the director demonstrates more restraint in violence and action (perhaps because of the censorship), but with fine acting from the cast and masterful direction from To, the film is a gritty police noir that is far from predictable.

To avoid a certain death sentence, a drug manufacturer Timmy Choi (Louis Koo) makes a deal to be an informer for Captain Zhang (Honglei Sun), who is determined to bring down an elusive drug cartel dealer. The premise is simple and familiar, but the film is gripping thriller about two men both trying to use the other.

Action set-pieces are few and far between, but once it starts, it gets intense as in the directors previous works. Another plus is on-location shooting that makes the film very realistic. Supporting players including Johnnie To regular Suet Lam are also effective. The film may lack the visual style of his better works like The Mission, but still manages to engage and entertain.",1392940800,,1051,4.833333333333333
5777217,3,B00D8CRDJ8,"The movie was okay, but could have been better because it long, and drawn out. The entire movie was in a foreign language with English sub titles at the bottom. It was very slow throughout most of the movie, then it picked up. There was plenty of action, but you kind of lost interest as to what the storyline was. I would not recommend it unless someone had the movie and you borrowed it from them.",1391299200,,399,4.2631578947368425
5777218,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Okay so the story isn't that great, but in all seriousness the 2 big action/gun fight scenes in this film are probably the best I've ever seen, especially the second gun fight wich alone is worth watching this film, no joke, I was blown away and was left more than satisfeid to get an action flick fix.",1390953600,,302,4.315789473684211
5777219,5,B00D8CRDJ8,"I think it behooves anyone working on a best of 2013 list to make sure you have seen this one. Johnnie To is one of my favorite current auteurs and I generally like anything from his coproduction company Milkyway. Do not be surprised if this is going to be on my top 10 2013 list of film -- which I will eventually make around the middle of this year since I am behind as usual with newer movies. I had some trepidation going into this because of the Mainland censor rules, but I noticed a lot of positive reviews as well that this made several film critics top 10 lists.

In the prologue you see Hong Kong citizen Timmy Choi Tin-ming (Louis Koo: Throw Down) driving his car erratically throwing up with burns on his face while the Orwellian omnipresent cameras film his movements. What you do not know at this point is he is fleeing a meth lab explosion which killed his wife and her brothers. This takes place in Jinhai (I believe this is Jinghai a municipality of Tianjin) as well as in the Heping District. Meanwhile two simultaneous events are happening: there is an undercover sting led by the Stetson wearing Captain Zhang Lei (the Stetson reminds me of both Jean-Pierre Melville and Lau Ching-wan in A Hero Never Dies) and two out-of-area cops (fromYuejiang) are following a suspected meth truck of Bill Lis.

After being captured by the police, Timmy is able to talk into redeeming himself if he turns informer. He will do anything to avoid the death penalty for his meth manufacturing. He tells of an upcoming meeting between manufacturer front Li Shuchang and ebullient distributer HaHa. This leads to a fascinating set of scenes where Zhang inserts himself as a fake proxy pretending to be both HaHa and Li Shuchang to gain trust from both sides. But what starts off as a police procedural ends up a mental battle of wills between Zhang and Timmy. While Timmy is corroborating, he of course, has other plans. But how far he will go and what he will do helps make this a fascinating film. Johnnie To fans will also be wondering when Lam Suet will show up.

In the end you get the feeling that one cannot escape the reach of the Mainland law with their vast resources of money and people. But you also get the feeling that no one is going to stop trying either. This is a starkly bleak film not just in theme but in the cinematography from longtime collaborators Cheung Siu-keung and To Hung-mo as well. Johnnie To has partially attributed this to him working more about content passing the censors and less time on visual style.

The end shoot-out that resembles Expect the Unexpected has been much heralded and rightly so. It is sometimes discombobulating in a way that sometimes you forget the dichotomy between who is bad and who is good. But there was an earlier shoot out with the Mute brothers that was so fantastic that I had to re-watch a few times after finishing the film. It also literally reminds me of the title Expect the Unexpected where I did not expect them to be that effective as they are calm and focused like the emotionless hit-man in The Boondock Saints. Since it is mainly from their perspective it also puts you in their mind-set and makes the government the aggressors and trespassers. In this film he tends to foster the humanity of the antagonists more than the police. Film professor David Bordwell makes a salient point in his essay on the film (link below): Yet the result humanizes the crooks more than the cops. Timmy mourns his family; we don't know if Captain Zhang has one.

I do think if he was to make this in Hong Kong and not under the SAPPRFT (State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television) rules there would have been a few differences in script as well as tone. There would have been more ambiguity, especially with the cop character. There would have been more bloody violence. I would have expected a more open ending. In a way it reminds me of film noir movies under the Hays Code. You knew that while watching the film certain facts were going to be evident. You know the bad guys are not going to get away (and they are from Hong Kong which probably helped sell this to the censors.) You know the cops are going to be portrayed as good with little to no ambiguity which it makes it difficult to do one of Tos favorite themes -- The psychological Doppleganger. These reasons are why I would not rank this up with my favorite To films like Election, Sparrow or Throw Down. Regardless, this is an excellent film and To has a way with being provocative and pushing ideas past the censors. But like with films under the Hays Code and with past Chinese films that have broached taboo topics with allegory (early Zhang Yimou) it is all in how you present the material.

You have to pay attention in a Johnnie To film. He often just presents salient information once so if you missed something that can create a misunderstanding later. Sometimes you are not given all you need to know right away and important plot aspects are revealed later. It makes his oeuvre a little more difficult than many directors but often a lot more rewarding especially with subsequent viewings. This film is no exception and is highly recommended and is one of my favorite of 2013.

DVD Notes: I saw this on the R1 Well Go release. On insert of disc: Well Go advertisement, trailers Ip Man: The Final Fight, The Guillotines, New World (those later three are also under Trailers). There is one Trailer (2.02m), but unfortunately no extras. Removable English subtitles and two audio tracks (Mandarin 5.1 Dolby Digital and Mandarin 2.0 Stereo.)",1390521600,,5597,4.596596596596597
5777220,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Lots of action in this movie, and the good guys aren't always what the seem to be, almost everyone in the movie was a bad guy!!",1390521600,,127,3.923076923076923
5777221,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Realistic depiction of the actual drug war going on in China. I wish it was HD. This version is the same one played in China. The Hong Kong version's ending has the drug dealer walked away, but that was prohibited by Chinese government, as it would be viewed as praising the drug dealer and belittling the cops.",1389139200,,311,4.473684210526316
5777222,5,B00D8CRDJ8,"This is one of Johnnie To's latest gritty Hong Kong dramas. It exudes the classic genre of HK action films but brings in a new layer of sophistication and modern reality. I have been watching his (Johnnie To) movies for a long time and he seems to surprise me once again. It is a little violent and has mature themes but they serve a purpose, to keep the plot moving along nicely. I recommend this film if you are a HK movie buff or if you are as tired of Hollywood predictability that plagues the US film industry as I am.",1389052800,,523,4.188118811881188
5777223,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"The drab, dusty, industrial backdrop of what is purported as the unglamorous metropolis of Tian Jin, China, tacky haute facades are the setting for Drugs Wars series of raw, tension filled episodes. From a country riddled with censorship, Drugs Wars, a film by Johnnie To, is an unbridled glimpse of organized crime and crystal meth in China. Although perhaps a tad sensationalistic, the film delivers a bold statement: the Chinese the drug market is alive and well.

Louis Koo plays a busted crystal meth baron who has a choice, either help police bust a massive organized crime syndicate, or be executed. He chooses to help police.

In an elaborate tireless scheme, actor Honglei Sun dazzlingly plays a police officer portraying a criminal in the attempt to infiltrate this upper echelon syndicate. The best scene of the film is when Suns character is forced to rail two massive lines of crystal meth as part of this act. The effects of the meth play out into a powerful piece of cinema. Post- OD, literally having come back from the edge death, the chase for the criminals continues with out a flinch.

At times this police tenacity is too exaggerated to be believable. The chase for the bad guys goes on endlessly for days. None of the cops ever eat or sleep. They seem to have inexhaustible resources at their disposal. They are able to commandeer an entire harbour just to put on a show of authenticity for the crooks. The cops risk their lives over and over, and for what? To rid the world of a few truckloads of drugs? The conventional divide between the good guy cops and bad guy criminals doesnt blur, until it does. After an epic final gun battle, we have no idea whos who.

Drug Wars attains excellence as an action movie and serves as a rare example of a controversial work to emerge from a country that produces so much state-approved propaganda.

5777224,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Like the Cold Case series on CBS, this film's ending instructs the audience how unacceptable murder is and in this case, how inappropriate it is that so many above average high quality Chinese are sacrificed to defeat/halt the bad ones and these murders perpetrators by the greedy and the merciless set the tone for the Chinese government lack of sympathy and their inspiration for going after every criminal, every collaborator, every menace to society.

When the mutes burn the cash in some show of sympathy and ""respect"" for their ringleader's loss (he lies that he buried them but he left them rotting in their own filth), I imagine Mainland audiences gasping in outrage at the disrespect for the impoverished overworked majority in the country who have never even seen that much money and are now watching ""handicapped"" so-called disenfranchised members of society burning them.  This film cleverly introduces criminals in their seemingly desperate Third World state - but look closely and you will notice the viciousness in their eyes - quite unlike decent members of society who make up the backbone of China and are the driving force of the Factory of the World.  You don't see the everyday man and woman engaging in drug trafficking so how is it in a country where over 1 billion are still poor, can we excuse this small but lethal number who collaborate with outside parties to basically destroy a society that is struggling to get on its feet.  No wonder the death penalty is enforced immediately.  China is at war with organized crime.  They want to enslave everyone - you'll either be their lackeys or their hookers and they will make you suffer their brutality and their stupidity.

By the end of the film, you may be really really angry at criminals and have no mercy or sympathy for their claims of a bad sad life because look what they do to the good guys.  Those losses are unacceptable.",1387843200,,1905,4.804281345565749
5777225,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Director and producer Johnnie To has a long career of action films made in Hong Kong this though is mainland China and if you were worried he may have toned things down then the fretting is over as this is pure Hong Kongese. We start with a man losing control of his car and crashing dramatically into a shop.  Then we get Police Drug squad Captain Zhang Lei (Honglei Sum The Road Home) who realises that this man is actually a wanted drug baron  Tian Ming (Lois Koo). They point out to him that he is facing the death penalty, and they do not mess around in China so this is no idle threat. He agrees to help them snare all the drug dealers in order to save his own skin.

What seems to be the break of a lifetime for our hardworking narcotics cops soon becomes a bit of a game of cat and mouse as all is never what it seems and some of these drug people are rather useful with automatic weapons, semi automatics and just about anything that goes bang or can cause mayhem. The gun battles are very realistic and very full on; the violence is not gratuitous but seems perfectly in place given the situations. The use of vehicles is great too especially the ice cream van.

The acting is all very well done and no expense has been spared  the double crosses are never that well signposted either; so all in all it made for an extremely enjoyable 107 minutes of screen time. Originally released as Du Zhan and filmed in Cantonese and Mandarin with good sub titles this is a film for action lovers and those who like a full on rollicking adventure  with some cops and bad guys thrown in for good measure.",1387670400,3,1601,4.28476821192053
5777226,5,B00D8CRDJ8,"Makes every other crime film from America look tame and pitiful.  It is intense in both its action and in its suspense sequences; yet it never loses touch with the human aspect of the characters.  Well-acted, well-crafted, and the final shootout sequence makes the shootout from Michael Mann's ""Heat"" look like a mild disagreement.  Buy it and spread the word about Johnnie To.",1387411200,,377,4.9523809523809526
5777227,4,B00D8CRDJ8,"Drug War is an excellent piece of Asian cinematography, I was definitely entertained with this movie. Drug War embodies all the elements of a good film; calculated direction (director), talented actors, intriguing suspense, the action was grounded nicely, meaning that it wasn't over the top, solid storyline and climax. I gave Drug War only four stars because it wasn't flawlessly executed*, but still a good movie nonetheless. Again, I enjoyed the film and felt as if it was money well spent. If you're a fan of Asian film as I am, Drug War will not disappoint.

*If you're an Asian Film junkie, here are a few of the best modern (Drama/Action/Suspense) Asian films: I Saw The Devil (2010), The Chaser (2008), lastly, the best and arguably the the most flawlessy executed... The Man From Nowhere (2010).",1384387200,,805,4.919117647058823
