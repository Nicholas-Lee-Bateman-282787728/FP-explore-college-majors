5187411,5,B008WCP2GA,"Originally, I only went to see this movie with a couple of friends because they were thunder fans(Go Wiz!). (Even wanted to bring a pillow with me as I thought I was going to fall asleep halfway through.) I mean, NBA Players can't act right? Boy was I wrong, even though Kevin Durant's acting isn't the best, it defiantly seemed believable as the storyline really gripped me throughout the movie. Even though this is a knock off of some older movies, it brings a refreshing ""2012"" style to the plot.",1355788800,,499,4.555555555555555

5187413,4,B008WCP2GA,"Engaging tale about a high school basketball towel boy who attends NBA Thunder game and ends up with Kevin Durant's basketball skills!

He goes out for the basketball team, coached by Jim Belushi and plays like a pro, getting the pretty girl along the way.  But, he gets a big head and is no fun.  Meanwhile, Durant struggles.  Durant's agent concludes the boy has Durant's skills so they try and trade back.

This is a film for the whole family to enjoy. Kevin Durant will never be considered a great actor but he plays himself well. Though the storyline is fictional, it uses Kevin in settings that could otherwise be his real life including scenes with his mother, Rumble, Thunder Girls, and I recognize some arena employees.  There is also action of KD (Durant) in real NBA games and also some high school games with actor Taylor Gray (playing Brian) who accidentally receives Durant's 'skills' and uses them to his advantage on and off the court.

Keep an eye out for hottie actress Tristin Mays (playing Isabel, Brian's love/like interest) who steals every scene she is in with charm, a dazzling smile, and a bubbly personality.  I'll have to check her out in future movies.  Tristin also has a video blog (on the Blu-Ray, not the DVD) in which she goes behind the scenes of the movie.

The funniest scenes of the movie are Kevin's mom, Wanda Pratt playing a cheerleader who tries to cheer her son up after he mysteriously loses his skills overnight that causes his team to go on a long losing streak and also other scenes where they show Kevin missing every shot attempt badly and stumbling around with the basketball while trying to film a commercial.

This is such a light-hearted and good natured comedy with numerous cameos that I believe you will have no trouble watching this movie again and again.  Make sure you get the Blu-Ray for the extra behind the scenes footage!

Let's have a sequel! I'm ready right now for 'Thunderstruck 2 : Shoot To Thrill'! with a cameo by AC/DC where Kevin Durant steals Angus Young's guitar skills and showmanship and becomes a rock star!

Thunder Up and buy this movie!",1354665600,2,1951,5.2243589743589745
5187416,3,B008WCP2GA,"This movie is basically ""Like Mike"" as a kid, in this case with no basketball talent, gets an NBA stars talent transferred to him. Not through magic shoes though in this case it's just like Space Jam where the talent is transferred through the ball.

The kid is usually picked on but because of his new basketball talent he becomes popular and shows up his bully before he becomes a jerk himself.

The basketball in it is pretty fake as the kid dunking looks like he's flying rather than jumping and the same play is shown a few times but from slightly different angles and supposed to be different plays. Mixed in are some Kevin Durant highlights/lowlights from actual games.

Durant plays himself and it is a good thing they gave him an energetic manager to pair next to him as otherwise his scenes are fairly boring. A Durant fan might like seeing him but he's not in it that much besides shooting poorly in a gym on a few occasions and trying to get his talent back from the kid

The highlight of the film is the charming Tristin Mays as Isabel. She plays the female lead of the movie and the love interest to Brian. She liked him for him and before his basketball transformation and calls him out for turning into a conceited jerk later on in the movie who's more focused on living the good life than staying true to his friends

In the end though the message is that teamwork and effort can trump overall talent and Brian somehow does more with a lack of talent than Kevin Durant ever did as he switched talents with Brian and is doing terrible in the NBA while Brian enjoys all of his success and no amount of practice has improved Durant's game. Brian does well with his lack of talent though and even after the switch back occurs he's supposedly better at basketball even though he practiced a lot before the switch and still stunk

Some mixed messages and limited basketball realism  but recommended if you have small children who are a fan of the Thunder and or Kevin Durant",1354579200,8,1985,4.451790633608815
5187417,4,B008WCP2GA,"Cant beat a good film you can set down and watch and not worry about every other word being a curse word or something blowing up.

It has life lessons that can be taken away from it and applied to everyday living.

Not only does Kevin Durant play basketball he also as a pretty good acting demeanor.

It has good clean comedy and or course kids being kids.

A good all around popcorn flick to watch with your young ones. Not many films like that these days.

If your looking for a CGI, Blow stuff up movie. This isn't for you.",1353888000,10,526,4.1683168316831685
5187418,3,B008WCP2GA,This is the type of movie we have seen thousand times or so. If u ever seen like mike or like mike 2 . U have seen this movie nothing diffent. Only thing they did this time . The kid got the talent thru a basketball instead of shoes. But its the same story over again . Loeser kid . Gets talent . Wins every basketball game everone likes him. And in the end the basketball player gets his game back.,1353715200,4,399,3.9382716049382718
5187419,5,B008WCP2GA,"Every now and then, a film comes along and changes our perspective into the realm of logic and life. A film that warps reality, forcing the viewer to completely re think their entire life. A film that leaves you in such awe, words can do no justice. I have seen this film more times than I can count, and every single time I finish it, I want to immediately watch it again.

To start out, the director. When my children have children, they'll talk about the great directors making some of the best cinema of the 21st century. Paul Thomas Anderson, David Fincher, Terrance Malick and now John Whitesell. After previously directing the brilliant Big Momma's House trilogy, which are on par with the Star Trek Trilogy (Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock, The Voyage Home), the Lord of the Rings films, the Star Wars films and the Dollars films. Along with Malibu's Most Wanted, proving that Jamie Kennedy deserves an Oscar, and Deck the Halls with the comedy duo of Matthew Broderick and Danny Devito, in the shadow of Abbot and Costello. This is a man who has a vision to change the way we think but Thunderstruck completely wipes the floor with his other films. ""Wipes the floor"", get it?

I'm no sports fan but Kevin Durant needs to put down the basketball, and pick up an Oscar. He completely sells his role and you see him not as an actor, but as a man. On top of that, newcomer Taylor Gray, the Marlon Brando of the 21st century. You feel his struggles, see his anguish, jump for joy when he succeeds, mixes the bag of emotions that you won't be able to help yourself from. I found myself in tears walking out of the cinema, from his groundbreaking performance that not even the great Daniel Day Lewis can poke at. Once I left the theater and immediately purchased my ticket for the next showing, I had such tears in my eyes that after they hit the ticket, you could barely read the title.

It mixes comedy and drama well, going back to my previous point of the film stupendously mixing the emotions. At one moment, you laughing your basketballs off at the perfect chemistry of Durant and Gray as they struggle trying to get their powers back. You feel the anger when Gray's bullies rough him up with some foul talk, unaware of the genius in front of them. Feel the joy of their companionship and how the thing that brings them together is a game of basketball.

Aside from the acting, the writings is on par and doesn't feel outdated with it's various references. The film required two writers since it can't take just one to create a masterpiece. Eric Champnella who's previous work is Mr. 3000, the definitive baseball film, and the straight to Disney Channel (should've been permanently in cinemas) Mailed to the Chief. The other writer should also be noted, Jeff Farley who had a brilliant role as Tabby's Security Officer in the mind blowing Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Jr.

I could write a book on the brilliance of this film but words can do it no justice. It just HAS TO be seen to be believed. Make way for your top favorite films list, if this doesn't crack the top 3, don't ever act like you know cinema. Please, PLEASE experience this masterful, genius, brilliant work before you die. I PROMISE you won't regret it.",1353628800,61,3227,4.528301886792453

5187516,5,B008WCP2GA,"Thunderstruck is a teen-age film that features Oklahoma City Thunder and NBA superstar Kevin Durant.

The story's a simple one. Brian Newall is a big fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder and the team's standout player Durant, but short and clumsy himself, he's relegated to managing the Eagles, the high-school team coached by self-promoting coach Amross and his lock-step assistant. Brian's also tormented by his little sister Ashley, who posts videos of his backyard catastrophes at the basket, which are then picked up and shown on campus by team star Connor. All this when Brian is trying to impress the pretty new girl, Isabel.

When Brian's dad takes him to a Thunder game to cheer the kid up, the boy's selected to try a half-time prize shot, which he muffs badly, conking the mascot instead. Durant consoles him by giving him a signed ball, but unknowingly also his own talent. Suddenly Durant can't nail the basket at all, sending his team down the tubes, while Brian becomes the Eagles' spark plug, making incredible moves and scoring forty and fifty points a gamebringing him campus adulation and Amross the dream of a state championship. Unfortunately, in the process Brian gets a swelled head, ignoring his best friend Mitch and alienating Isabel.

Fortunately Durant's agent Alan figures out what's happened and desperately tries to reverse the talent switch, though he must first convince Durant he's not just suffering a terrible slump. And, of course, Brian has to come to his senses and realize he shouldn't profit from somebody else's ability without working for the skill himselfor ditch his friends. One guess as to how things turn out.

The film has a great, if not commonplace, message: Work hard to get ahead. Don't take any shortcuts. Those teachable moments make it a worthy diversion for parents and kids already cheering for Durant, the NBA or sports-themed entertainment. Durant's personal motto, which is repeated often, is ""Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard."" And that slogan acts as the backbone of the film, educating young audience members about the importance of practice. I am sure that people who love basketball and Durant fans would love this one too. Boys of a certain ageand their sports-minded dadsprobably won't mind. For them, it won't be earth-shaking, but it should prove a harmless invitation to spend a little quality time together.",1418256000,,2396,5.027707808564232

5187533,4,B008WCP2GA,"- NBA post-game show host Ernie Johnson: ""So what is wrong with Kevin Durant?""
- Charles Barkley: ""Well, I can't tell you what's wrong, but I can tell you what he's doing right... nothing. He's turrible.""

16-year-old Brian Newall's reach very much exceeds his grasp, but maybe poet Robert Browning shouldn't have been so smug with that line. Brian's one big aspiration has brought him nothing but grief. His idol is Kevin Durant, that lanky superstar forward on the Oklahoma City Thunder. And so there's Brian (Taylor Gray) on the driveway, emulating No. 35's silky smooth moves, and the poor klutz just ends up hurting himself always. Plenty of Brian's basketball, um, exploits have been cruelly documented on camera and, hence, on YouTube. Kid is the laughingstock of Eastview High, OKC. He's on the school's basketball squad, but only as the team manager (re: towel boy).

Thunderstruck is no classic, but, boy, is it watchable. It's family-friendly fare (I do note the words ""crap"" and ""piss off"" are discharged once each). Kevin Durant, a very humble cat, had to be talked into going Hollywood. And while he won't be taking food off other actors' tables with his emoting skills, he generates a very likeable presence. I know these are differently toned movies, but I find him more naturally sympathetic than Shaq in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Chips/dp/B00AEFXJY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Chips</a>&nbsp;or Ray Allen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-Got-Game/dp/630514415X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He Got Game</a>&nbsp;or Michael Jordan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Jam/dp/B004GJYROG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Jam</a>.

What's taken from real life is how much of a good dude Durant is. I can totally see him feeling sorry for a young fan what just humiliated himself trying to sink a half-court shot during intermission. Durant signs a commemorative Thunder basketball and forks it over to Brian Newall. Brian wishes out loud that he had Durant's talent, and, in these kinds of movies, a wish errantly made carries significant power.

Cue the next morning comin' as the film proceeds to chart the utter collapse of Kevin Durant's game. No. 35 suddenly cannot make buckets, can't spin or cut or cross over or dunk worth a lick. It's neat that we could readily believe that Durant's persistence and work ethic are such that, even experiencing a horrific slump, he's still putting in endless hours in the gym trying to fix what ails him. Only, now, the Oklahoma City Thunder are in jeopardy of not making the playoffs.

Conversely, that same morning's brought about a drastic change in Brian. Come to find, he's abruptly got sweet handles and massive hops and an unerring jumper. He hopes his newfound skills and his immediate superstar status on Eastview's basketball team can attract that new girl from Denver, Isabel Sanchez, (Tristin Mays). Only, Mays brings such a level-headed vibe to the role, I wanted to counsel Brian that she don't play that, son. Mays reminds me of Varsity Blues' Amy Smart in how supremely unbowled over she is when her star athlete beau devolves into an ego-trippin' jackhole. So, yes, Thunderstruck heavily borrows from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaky-Friday/dp/B00005JMCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaky Friday</a>&nbsp;AND from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Varsity-Blues/dp/B00AEBB9UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Varsity Blues</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teen-Wolf-Teen-Wolf-Too/dp/B000068TPB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teen Wolf & Teen Wolf Too</a>.

There were outbreaks of laughter and impromptu cheering in my household when we watched this. Thunderstruck is good-natured and pretty funny, especially if you're plugged into the hoops universe and you're familiar with Kevin Durant. And because it's also that kind of movie, life lessons are imparted. Kid viewers will learn about the value of friendship and team work and working hard and persevering even though the odds are overwhelming, and, also, that you don't ever mess with WNBA star Candace Parker's money (that's a funny scene).

But the single funniest scene in the film? For me, it's the shoe commercial sequence.

Kevin Durant may not be an acting prodigy but he's bolstered by a solid supporting cast. Jim Belushi hijacks plenty of scenes as Eastview High's blowhard basketball coach who claims he was once was a, no lie, ""Henry Ford Community College Honorable Mention All-Conference Guard."" It's humble brags like that from Belushi that made me grin big. Props as well to his son, Robert Belushi, who is great as his oddball assistant coach Dan. And, yeah, that's Durant's real-life mom, Wanda Pratt, who has an amusing cameo as onscreen Durant's mom.

No surprise that Taylor Gray is more sympathetic when he was this clumsy, bullied loser. He becomes less likeable when, like Michael J. Fox in Teen Wolf and James Van Der Beek in Varsity Blues, he lets newfound fame get to his head. So what Gray does here is nothing new. It's so key that he's convincing as a basketball phenom. He had to be able to mimic Durant's signature moves - like the ""Counter 62"" or the ""KD 35 Live Special"" - and he sells it on camera. Taylor Gray has got mad handles. So let him and No. 35 coax laughter out of you for an hour and a half. Kevin Durant as a hapless underdog? Who woulda thunk it?

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""Coach Z"" - featurette on Jim Belushi's character (00:03:19)

5187588,3,B008WCP2GA,"Could they have packed more mild language and product placements into this movie?  I guess that's the way of things and considered ""normal"", but maybe that has something to do with why we are in the mediocre pickle of an economy we have.  America and our kids deserve something excellent to strive for.  Brought up to 3 Stars because it is funny and ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"" is just the truth.

Although I'm not very interested in basketball, I enjoyed this movie. The beginning was okay, but it became much more entertaining once Alan (Durant's Agent played by Brandon T. Jackson) figured out what happened. Jackson's performance was as funny as I expected it to be. There are also important messages for young people about friendship and 'fitting in' - I liked that.

Thunderstruck is a good family film.
