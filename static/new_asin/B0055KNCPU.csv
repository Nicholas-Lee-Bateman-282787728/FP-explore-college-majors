It begins in a town square in Arkansas. A woman reporter visits the jail to record interviews with the prisoners. She talks to a sleepy drunk. Whats in it for him? Jack Rhodes will sing and play his guitar. A Free Man in the Morning is his song. Will he sing on the local radio station? [Note the dirt roads.] He does, and tells stories too. Lonesome Rhodes gets fan mail and attracts advertisers. Larry comes form all over. He talks about his youth. He suggests people should take their unwanted dogs to the jail. It affects them. A theatrical agent asks him to come to Memphis. Larry invites boys to jump into his employers swimming pool! He negotiates his pay, and a car too.

He is on television and strays from the script. He talks about big city life. Folks in trouble. He talks to a woman whose house burnt down and asks people to donate 50 cents to her; they do. He affects simplicity. Advertisers don't like the kidding about their products. [Remember Henry Morgan?] A man tells Larry about payments for mentioning commercial businesses. Isnt that illegal? Not if they don't catch you. Larry sings about the sponsor. Get me my lawyer says the sponsor. People demonstrate against the sponsor who fired him. New York city takes notice. Can he sell a product that is near worthless? Will changing its color help sales? His promotion on camera works well. Sales escalate. [A parody on advertising then.]

He is compared to Will Rogers. He will be made into a force for public opinion. He appears on the covers of LOOK and LIFE magazines. A flower is named after him. He appears on a show You Lived It. [A parody of This is Your Life]. He is lauded and given a penthouse apartment, but he is lonely. Millions of people follow him. Then a woman visits to as for $3,000 a month or she will expose him! They show a laugh machine that imitates a live audience. Larry says he will go to Mexico to finalize his divorce. Does his power make him dangerous? [To who?] He sings about baton twirling. Who will be the winner? Larry gets married in Juarez [validating his Mexican divorce]. His audience cheers Betty Lou, his bride. Fans rush the stage. [As will be seen with future rock bands.]

A long shot is used for the double who performs with flaming batons. Marcia is disappointed; she wants more than 10%. Walter Winchell talks about Larry. Mike Wallace interviews a Senator. He doesnt have popular appeal, he has to be repackaged. A dog will make him more popular, so too his facial expression. Larry influences public opinion. Senator Fuller spouts his slogans on TV. One man wrote a book to expose Larry. Marcia knows a lot about Larry. Larry orders Betty Lou back to Arkansas. Will Larry get a Cabinet position? He has high ratings. People follow him like sheep, he says. The show goes on. The family that prays together stays together. Marcia turns on the sound so Larrys comments go out over the air. His personality finally came through. Going down? Yes! There is a replacement for Larry on hand. His friends now reject him! Is he going through the roof? Marcia says it was me. Larry will be back again, but in a cheaper show. Or will he?

Special Feature

The idea of a wealthy man going into politics is the rule, not an exception, from the Rockefellers to Reagan to Lautenberg, they will become Governors or Senators. Would JFK have become a Senator without his fathers wealth? Look around for current examples today. There is an apology for Elia Kazans and Budd Schulbergs past political views. Who controls any political party? Arent they similar to a corporation? Does a Congressional Committee have an agenda? The political game is rigged against ordinary people unless they become attorneys for the wealthy. Lonesome Rhodes could be a prototype for Reagan: a smiling actor who attracts popular support. Who is the current equivalent? Could an evil man put on a nice face to gain popular support? Yes, its happened in the past and will reoccur. Does power lead to corruption? In most cases. It tells about the story of Uncle Don at the end.

Andy Griffith began his career as a stand-up comedian. This movie seems clumsy at times in telling its story. Was Reagan ambitious? Read Dark Victory by Dan Moldea for the history they won't tell you. What about those baton twirlers in their outfits? Larry was only more successful than the others.",1444780800,,4385,4.635778635778636
