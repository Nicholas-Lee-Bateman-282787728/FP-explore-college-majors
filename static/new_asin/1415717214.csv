7795546,5,1415717214,"I never watched the show when it aired, but the reruns caught my attention years ago. I enjoyed the episodes, and they were compelling. Recently, I decided to pick up the DVDs of Season One, and I've enjoyed the show once again. Again, the acting is impressive given what they had to work with. It's much better than anything that's on television the past decade. I wanted to make a commentary of some of the episodes. First thing I noticed is how many characters appear in one episode and then be never seen again. Having said that, notice how Brandon Walsh averages a woman per show. He is also a cheat, liar, racist, and drunk driver who could have killed somebody. He is easily pissed off and starts taking somebody's head out if slightly provoked. He acts like a saint with a conscience yet he is the biggest hypocrite I've seen on the show. At this point, I have a hard time debating who is worse: him or Brenda. She seems to have the flair of being so melodramatic, no matter the situation. She tries to take advantage of every opportunity to make the parents to feel worse by creating useless spats. I actually feel sorry for the parents, and I question their ever flowing leniency. On the other hand, I liked the rest of the characters, and they seem to be fine to me, even if they have innocuous glaring faults except for Steve Sanders. One episode ""One on One,"" Brandon makes the basketball team yet we never see him playing basketball ever again in the rest of the season. Another episode where Brandon discovers how lowly paid the third world workers are, and he decides to write a report on the owner of the caf&eacute;. So what happened? Really...I am still amazed how the other characters suddenly get dropped out like flies after showing up for one episode. I was thinking also where were the friends of Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Steve because it's impossible that, given their popularity in school, they were friendless before the Walshes moved in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, I liked the issues such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity. I know there is a lot of morality problem with the show while the characters delve themselves in the immoralities of life and still think they lead a life of morals. It's a tricky thing; however, the show is watchable regardless. That's why I enjoy it. For the DVD, it has been good, and letting you know, the pilot episodes are actually contained in the Season One package. That means you don't need to buy a separate DVD of the pilot show.",1277856000,,2585,4.621739130434783
