6087690,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Some of these things actually happened.

But probably not many of them. At least not in any way close to the presentation in American Hustle.

That doesn't stop it from being an excellent movie, though.

It's one of the few movies I've seen where I had no idea about what was coming next. At its base, it's a con movie, so you're never quite sure who's conning whom and what anyone has up his sleeve. Or under her skirt, I suppose, since the women are perpetually dressed as they are in the poster. And, then, at least a couple of the characters are at least slightly unhinged, and you never quite know which direction the story is going.

Surprisingly, the movie opens with one of those flash-forward/flashback type things that I normally hate, but they really made it work in this one. For one thing, the movie doesn't start near the climax, just at the point of the first sting operation. It's the place where we meet all of the major players, so to speak. Once the deal falls apart, we flashback with Irving Rosenfeld for a first person narration (which I also usually hate) of what brought him to that point. But what makes it interesting is that when we get to the part where he crosses paths with Sydney Prosser, she picks up the narration and, then, they have this kind of dueling narration giving us the back story, and it really works. It helps that it's not a ""36 hours earlier"" kind of scenario. It's the characters telling us about who they are, you know, as people, and that's what makes it work.

As interesting as the story is, though, it's the acting that makes this movie. The performances, all of them, are incredible.

Christian Bale shows us once again just what he's willing to do physically to become his character, this time putting on a bit of a paunch (which he shows off in the movie in a very unflattering way) and shaving a bald spot onto his head (also unflattering). He's what can only be described as a sleazy character, a con man, but, by the time we get back to the point in the story where it started, we have total sympathy for him. I just want to point out that I am not a Bale fan. I have respect for what he's willing to go through for a role (like in The Machinist and Rescue Dawn), and I think he's a good actor, but I don't really like him that much. That I say he was impressive in this role is, then, saying something.

Amy Adams--cute, sweet Amy Adams--shows us she's anything but as an ex-stripper trying to reinvent herself. Her boobs should probably also have received some sort of credit. Not that they ever fully appear onscreen or anything, but it's hard not to be aware of them when she's onscreen. She's like some 70s porn star or something. Or like what I think a 70s porn star must have been like. I'm not really sure. At any rate, her performance is pretty amazing, and you're never quite sure what she's up to, just that she is up to... things. It's her performance that provides a lot of the tension in the movie, because you're never really sure whose side she's on. Well, other than her own, that is.

Bradley Cooper is amazing as a somewhat overzealous FBI agent. And I'd say more about him, but I don't think I can without spoilers. I'll just say that I think Cooper has a certain intensity about him that not many actors can equal. And, according to my wife, he and Adams deliver one of the sexiest scenes she's ever seen. The amazing thing about that is that nothing happens in that scene. Well, not nothing but, you know, nothing happens: there is no loss of clothing or anything like that. But it's intense, and most of that is from him.

Jennifer Lawrence continues to show that she's more than just a pretty face. I'm not quite sure she deserved her Oscar last year (not that her performance wasn't good; it was. I've just never been convinced it was ""best actress"" quality), but, if she gets a best supporting Oscar for this role, it will be deserved. The scene with her and the ""science oven"" is almost enough all by itself to earn her the Oscar.

And, then, there's Jeremy Renner. And his hair. Because if Amy Adams boobs almost deserved a screen credit, Renner's hair certainly did. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was amazing. And, in a movie where everyone's hair was pretty amazing, that's saying something. This is the first movie I've seen him in where he shows me he can do something besides play ""taciturn hero"" (and, no, I haven't yet seen The Hurt Locker, but, knowing what it's about (loosely), I'm guess he plays ""taciturn hero"" in that one, too). He's pretty great as a New Jersey mayor in this. He's pretty great in the sense that I did not actually know he was in the movie before I was seeing the movie, and, then, I kept wondering if I was wrong and maybe that wasn't really him, so that, I think, is a pretty good performance.

Louis C.K. also fit in nicely. I don't think there was any kind of stretch for him as an actor, but he worked well with everyone else. As did Elisabeth Rohm (from Angel); I didn't recognize her at all.

The end result is a lot of compelling performances and an interesting plot. Enough so that, as I sit here writing this up, it makes me want to watch it again. Especially Jeremy Renner's hair. I don't think I've been so captivated by anyone's hair since the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl back in '93 (I think) and someone (Emmitt Smith?) poured a cooler of water over Jimmy Johnson's head, and his hair didn't move. It was like he had on a plastic, hair-shaped helmet. It was fascinating.

Oh! And the cameo appearance by De Niro... the perfect touch.",1387584000,2,5581,4.401551891367604
6087691,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"Some fine actors with bad clothing. Sexy women. A great scary cameo, one of the best scenes in the movie. But after all the hype, a real disappointment. Didn't come close to ""The Sting"" for trickery. Didn't connect with or find the characters interesting. How anyone would buy into their schemes is beyond belief. I live near some of the shooting locations, that was cool. It can wait for cable.
PS. Best bad hair was Bill Murray in ""Kingpin""",1387497600,5,442,4.6075949367088604
6087692,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"First we see: ""Some of this really happened."" And it's true. This chaotic R-rated mess was inspired by the late 70s Abscam mess which involved the FBI, the Mafia, a Middle Eastern Sheik and many elected officials. I never got it straight when it was happening and I scarcely did much better today.

Nominated for seven (7!) Golden Globes: Best Picture - Comedy or Musical; Best Actor and Actress; Best Supporting Actor and Actress; Best Director and Best Screenplay. I would suggest they also include Best Hair. In my opinion this one is head and shoulders above many other high-profile films because it's so much fun! Director David O. Russell (""The Fighter"") keeps things humming along and draws extremely natural performances from his cast.

We enjoy:
  * Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") as Irving (the names have been changed to protect the innocent), a two-bit flim-flam man lured into an entrapment scheme by an ambitious FBI agent. This time Bale is a stooped, paunchy, married schlub with the most tortured toupee and cockamamie comb-over I have ever seen.
  * Jennifer Lawrence (""Silver Linings Playbook"") is his wife Rosalyn, who knows Irving has a mistress but can't see why that should have any effect on their marriage. He has adopted her son and doesn't want to lose him. Her hairdo is a stylist's combo of ""Big Hair"" and ""Outrageous Hair."" She HATES that new-fangled ""science oven"" (microwave) because she ignored the warning and tried to heat a foil container. Eek!
  * Amy Adams (""Her"") is Sidney, Irving's partner in crime, both in and out of bed. Sometimes she's British, sometimes she's from Albuquerque. We see a LOT of Sidney in this one! She spends a lot of time with her hair in huge rollers.
  * Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") is Richie, the manic FBI man. He moves the outlandish plot forward by sheer force of will and is unforgettable with his hair in those teeny permanent wave rollers. Cooper and Adams generate some real sexual heat in this one. Whew!
  * Michael Pea (""End of Watch"") is Paco, a Hispanic from California recruited to play the Sheik. His hair is covered by a pseudo white cloth with a black band to make him look Middle Eastern.
  * Jeremy Renner (""The Town"") is the Mayor. He is the only (sorta) ""Good Guy"" in the bunch, with a glamorous wife and five children, all of whom he adores. Check out his heroic pompadour!

Kudos to Susan Jacobs for assembling the wonderful sound track: Everything from Duke Ellington and Steely Dan to ""Yellow Brick Road"" and ""Live and Let Die."" Loved it!

This has a satisfying wrap-up and I left the theater vowing to look up Abscam as soon as I got home. (I'll want to know more about it before the Academy Awards roll around, when it is sure to come up again.) Amazon will notify me when it's available on DVD.",1387497600,5,2795,4.6850715746421265
6087693,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell has become a household name in Hollywood and also amongst many avid moviegoers. While hes had several projects over the years, he really bust on to the scene in 2010 as the director of The Fighter  which starred Christian Bale and Amy Adams, both of whom were nominated for multiple awards for their individual supporting roles (Bale won both an Academy Award and Golden Globe). Flash forward two years and that brings us to 2012 where Russell once again made his mark on the big screen by penning the script (originally created by Matthew Quick) and directing Silver Linings Playbook. The film starred Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, both of whom earned several nominations for various awards of their own (Lawrence won both an Academy Award and Golden Globe). Now, here we are one year later as these four well-established actors star in Russells newest film, American Hustle.

In American Hustle, Christian Bale stars as a con artist named Irving Rosenfeld. One day, he meets an attractive woman at a party named Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who he immediately falls for and brings in to his racket. Together, the two are so successful conning people (approving loans, selling fake art, etc.) that it attracts the FBI. Sydney, working alongside Irving under a false name, is busted and taken into custody by an ambitious agent, named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). In order to clear Sydneys name, Irving and Sydney must work undercover alongside Richie to complete four major busts.

Posing with the fake financial backing of the foreign Sheik Abdullah (Michael Pea), the trio goes into business with the crooked New Jersey Mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). The beloved, yet crooked Mayor has a vision of returning Atlantic City to prominence and also creating thousands of new jobs. However, in order to do so, he must secure finances  which means he is willing to partner-up with the mob. The backroom dealings with the mob also require a few acts of Congress, leading to the eventual bribing of a handful of Congressmen and one Senator. However, the only thing that can screw everything up is Irvings wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who has a flare for the dramatic and constantly requires attention.

From the moment this film begins until the very end, its relatively safe to say theres no film in the history of cinema that depicts this much hustling, cheating, and lying. In the event that any one of the characters walked into a church, it would positively go up in flames. Irving is hustling Sydney, and she loves him for it. Rosalyn is hustling Irving, and he hates her for it. Richie hustles Sydney and Irving, while Sydney is constantly hustling Richie. Richie and company are hustling the mob, the Mayor, and members of Congress  and the FBI is behind all of it. There is literally no one in this film that isn't hustled at one point or another.

To that end, you need accomplished actors and actresses that are capable of selling these onscreen hustles, and with that being said, there might not be a more perfect ensemble in the history of filmmaking than the four individuals featured in this film. David O. Russell clearly had the unspeakably brilliant epiphany to bring the four highly acclaimed cast members from The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook together for one incredible feature. He even sneaks in (SPOILER) Robert De Niro from a perfectly timed cameo. And, the end result is a masterful work of art.

Christian Bale is the focal point of this character-driven story. For whatever reason, Bale needed to be overweight and balding for the role and also suffers from a serious heart condition. However, before you jump to any conclusions, it should be noted that none of these elements are vital to the story. Bales character is too confident to let his physical appearance hinder his appetite for the hustle. And confident he most certainly is  proving hes almost too good to be caught. He lives his life through one of the films most prudent themes: the art of survival.

Jennifer Lawrence is obviously a huge star these days, especially since he roles The Hunger Games films, along with the X-Men films and Silver Linings Playbook. Those films are all fine and dandy, but they are targeted towards a particular audience and will likely succeed with or without her involvement. Lawrence proves her talent, not by shooting arrows at people, but by taking on serious, well-written dramatic roles. Once more, Lawrence steals each and every scene in which shes present (mostly with her humorous nut ball comments)  and she does so with such elegance. Like her role in Silver Linings Playbook, she portrays a mentally disturbed individual with serious emotional distress. Even though shes only present for a handful of scenes in this film, shes still a main attraction, even despite the scene dominance of her wondrous cast mates.

While its easy to see the outstanding performances of Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence, the impressive acting of Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams shouldnt go unnoticed. Neither gives an over-the-top, career defining performance, but they are equally acclaim worthy. Cooper, more so than Adams, shows just how far hes come in Hollywood  going from comedy to action and now fully establishing himself as a serious dramatic actor. Of course, Amy Adams is already a domineering presence in dramatic acting, so the fact that she puts on an amazing performance is no surprise at all. The scenes that Cooper and Adams share together are remarkably energetic, and are proof that despite what you may think you see, the hustle never ends. Never.

Overall, its not surprising that so many have praised America Hustle as one of the top films of 2013. Theres little doubt this film tries to make hustling look cool  and it succeeds. It also doesnt fail to make these ambitious characters look cool  with their flashy hair, scantily clad outfits, and smooth dialog. No, this film doesnt have the satisfying payoff that youd expect from a movie like Oceans 11, but it does prove that crime-centric films are still unbelievably entertaining. Obviously, there are drawbacks to seeing this film. Most notably, there is no action-packed shootouts or ridiculous CGI. American Hustle is simply a film where acting and character development come first, while everything else, like plot and tying up loose ends comes second. If drama is your fancy, this film will plain and simply knock your socks off.

6087694,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell is my new favorite American movie director.
Silver Lining Playbook (2012) was good, and American Hustle (2013) ranks in just as good.
Last time I saw a WELL made movie in recent times take takes place in 1970's America was Boogie Nights (1997) and Lovelace (2012), but now that I saw American Hustle, I must say I am blown away by the fashion details, dialogue, and soundtrack of this movie.
Although, its music could have been even better if they had at least two songs by the KC & the Sunshine Band, such as:
""Keep it Comin' Love"" or ""Shotgun Shuffle"", or ""I like to Do it"", and some Barry White wouldn't hurt either...it could have been 1970's boogie to the core.

Most importantly, what I like about this film is the cast (everyone is just brilliant in their role), and the dialogue, the script is prefect, the jokes smart and witty.  The touch of comedy incorporated into this film is pure genius.
I hope to see similar movies from Russell in the near future.

BTW: Jennifer Lawrence should accept more movie roles similar to the one she played in this film. She is only wasting her talent in BS Hunger Games franchise. Hey but I understand, movie stars need to appeal to the masses of people and make BS movies once in a while in order to rake in profits.",1387497600,,1278,4.452991452991453
6087695,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" (2013 release; 138 min.) opens with the reminder that ""Some of this actually happened"", after which we are transported to New York, April 1978, where the mayor of Camden NJ (played by Jeremy Renner) is apparently being set up in an FBI undercover sting operation of some sort. We see the main characters yet do not know who is who exactly. Then in a further flashback (along with voiceover), we get to know Irving (played by Christian Bale), who meets Sydney (played by Amy Adams) at a party. They hit it off on all levels, and soon the are doing various scams. Comments Sydney: ""the more you say 'no' to people, the more they want in!"". Unfortunately in one of those scams, the 'victim' was an undercover FBI agent named Richie (played by Bradley Cooper). Richie eventually convinces Irving and Sydney to help him uncover corrupt politicians, and they set in motion a giant scam. Apart from all that, we learn that Irving is actually married to Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence), who seems to be a 'dumb blond'. At this point we are barely 30 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is another tour de force for director David Russell, after last year's Silver Linings Playbook, and The Fighter the year before that. From the moment the movie opens, Russell pulls us in and won't let go until some 2 hours later. At some point in the movie it becomes impossible to tell who is manipulating whom, and you'll just let go and be surprised as the movie unfolds. Because of the nature and era of the movie, ""American Hustle"" feels like The Sting-meets-Taxi Driver-meets-The Godfather, just a delight from start to finish. Second, there are so many outstanding acting performances in this movie, I don't even know where to begin. As scheduling fate would have it, I saw Christian Bale just recently in ""Out of the Furnace"" and now in this, in two roles that couldn't be more different, yet he displays an incredible and confidant acting range reminiscent of, say, a younger Robert de Niro. Speaking of which: de Niro makes a small appearance (10 min. max) that is better than anything he has done in YEARS. Amy Adams has never looked more gorgeous than in this movie. And Jennifer Lawrence (just weeks after seeing her in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) makes the most of her small role. Last, but certainly not least, the movie soundtrack (from the 70s) is nothing short of stellar. Check out the delightful scene where Sydney and Richie are dancing to Donna Summer's I Feel Love, and later when Rosalyn cleans the house while singing/dancing along to Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die. Sheer delight!

The movie opened today (yes, Thursday is the new Friday apparently) and I went to see it right away. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended, I am happy to say. This movie truly is Hollywood at its very best: an intelligent, absorbing and yes, entertaining movie from start to finish, it could be for this year what ""Argo"" was for last year, frankly. ""American Hustle"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1387411200,185,3198,4.719141323792487

They have great success until they are busted by the FBI early in the film.  They have a chance to avoid prosecution by helping the FBI entrap other con men, and the operation quickly escalates out of everyone's control as the FBI go for bigger and bigger fish.  In the end, the FBI  bring down a few people, some of whom might have been corrupt even without the cash the FBI passed them, but they botch the investigation and are conned by the con men.

6087797,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I can't remember if Amy Adams got an Oscar for this? She sure as heck deserves it though. I just read a couple of ridiculous reviews and want to say I really like this movie. Of course I grew up in the 70's. With Kangaroo sneakers with little side pockets. Doin' ""The Hustle"", and no I'm not talking about a con or card game. The 70's for kids was a really cool time. We had rollerskating parties at roller rinks and we rode our bicycles with banana seats and little plastic streamers coming out of the handle bars...right down the middle of the street! And everyone played outside. Times were good. John Travolta and The Bee Gee's ruled. So did Diana Ross. And man, people dressed up! They just put a whole lot more into it than now. Clothes and style really meant something back then. The music, the fashion, everything was filled with shine and spirit.

This movie is just plain fun. There are many hilarious scenes especially when Bradley Cooper takes a call from ""Edith"" and his mom yells at him to ""get back here and pray properly!"" Edith then finds out he has a fiance. Yep. This is great stuff.
Love the Ice fishing in October story. Who goes Ice fishing in October? Seriously.

I haven't gotten to the end yet but I have laughed so hard at this Arab Sheikh who is really a Mexican from Arizona and upset about Operation ""Abscam"" because he says it's racist. I love that actor too.

This movie is way funny. I think, you either get it, or you don't. I hope terrible things don't happen in the end. They kinda might though. I get the feeling that Christian Bale is gettin in tight with Jeremy Renner and he is trying to think of a way to warn him before Renner gets caught. You can just see it all over Christian. It's all so wrong to set Renner up and trap him like that. He really is a very decent good guy. Bradley Cooper's character is so naive and has visions of glory but he doesn't care who gets destroyed by his ""ideas"" of greatness at the FBI. These are real people he is entrapping. It can't end well for anyone.

6088222,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"What a great cast in this fairly crazy 80's themed drama. I can't say that I really got that involved in the lives of the characters, feared for them, cried with them or even cheered for them, but I liked that it was happening to them and not me for sure, so I guess there is that. Thinking back though I really felt bad for the senator that was brought into the center of the whole thing, I really hope that more than one of them out there is really trying to make a difference in the lives of the people they represent.

I enjoyed waiting to see who might show up next and to see how they kept the feel of that day. The outfits were crazy in many ways, colors, styles and the over all look was ""This people are over the top"" for sure.

Like much of the stuff that either came out of the 70s or portrays the 70s, however, there is a layer of grunge over the story, a depressing patina.

6088363,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"Against my wishes but to please my lovely wife we paid good money to watch this idiotic film again. We saw it in the theater when it was released and I could not believe how many Academy Award nominations it received. But the Academy has been sinking for a long time along with most of Hollywood elite. Little is left of the glory days when good films were built on solid stories, good acting and superb directing. American Hustle had not of that. What it did have in almost every scene was nearly exposed breasts. Any movie that has a character in dresses and blouses that plunge as far as her navel and more in her every scene is a movie that is begging for eyeballs because there is no other reason to watch the movie. Amy Adams is pretty enough but she was as lame in this as in Leap Year. Christian Bale who has been top notch in most of his roles was stuck with paying a pathetic character in need of a bottle of booze and an retirement in a 1972 mobile home park. Bradley Cooper over played almost every scene...only in one did he really shine when it all crashed down around him. Jennifer Lawrence was wasted in this bore of a movie.",1457913600,,1141,4.2626728110599075

Complications kick in and the stakes and tension rise. The good guys and bad guys take on shades of grey and there are some great surprises. The entire cast is excellent, Amy Adams is stunning in the 70s fashions, Brad Cooper makes them work great too. Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner offer wonderful surprises and Christian Bale is almost unrecognizable as the conflicted conman at the middle of it all. The script is excellent with some sizzling scenes and the costumes and the music perfect. This film has it all! It is vibrant and vivid, sexy and so cool  even on the second viewing!

I give this 4.75 stars cause I mostly love it. The actors are impeccable. Again (as I mentioned with my Silver Linings Playbook review) it is the incredible love story here that grabs me hard. As they introduce each other it pulls you into their hearts and then we watch the relationship as well as the story unfold.

So did Deniro, who should play more ruthless gangsters in his old age. Lawrence was compelling, but it felt a little overacted. I already forgot about everyone else. I got bored as it went along, feeling it was a bit of a slog. I probably won't watch it ever again, but it's worth at least one viewing.",1453075200,,455,4.428571428571429

It looks like you're watching an honest to god 35mm film print on your television somehow. The colors, the film grain, everything is masterful. It's not as flashy as an effects-driven flick shot on HD video, but it looks truer to how it was shot than pretty much any other blu ray I currently own.

6088526,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"David Russell is an director who enjoys showing the life of everyday characters and they way they interact with each other. Ordinary people are elevated to greatness in his films- just watch Silver Linings Playbook to see what I mean. American Hustle is a story about a few scammers and their scams but it is mostly about the different characters, their lives, their weaknesses, their strengths and the way they interact with their friends and families.

Christian Bale is amazing as a scammer and with Amy Adams as his equally crooked friend and partner they are sensational. You should feel revulsion towards these people but when you see their side stories and complicated lives - you start to understand their motives and intentions.
Bradley Cooper, though not as good as Silver Linings is still amazing. His character is also very well written and  is a about a man trying to be someone.
Jennifer Lawrence has a shorter role but she is a maniac- just too good. Jeremy Renner is Polito, a New Jersey mayor a good man who sometimes has to be dishonest.  I loved the way these characters come alive. They transform themselves completely

This is a great film that you will find extremely enjoyable, I have purposely not written about the story because you just have to see this film to enjoy it. Release date: 20th, December, 2013.",1451692800,,1333,4.782608695652174
6088527,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"What an amazing ensemble of talent, and what remarkable costuming and story line. I love this movie for both those qualities - the visual and the story.  I rented this and wish I had just purchased it. Stunned it did not win any of the many Oscar nominations it was up for - at least Golden Globe Awards go it right. That was a year of fabulous movies though - so hard to pick maybe. This is a trip down late 70's memory lane and I enjoyed that part as well.  What I don't get is why it is described as a comedy. It is fabulously entertaining - never stops moving, and that chaos is definitely sympathetic with the characters and the plot. These are not calm people or events - lots of tension, lots of drama, lots of loose cannons going off. But comedy? Yes, there are some great moments that will make you smile but to me this is drama along the line of Wolf on Wall Street. I cannot imagine how any one would be disappointed watching this.

6088598,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Truly a contemporary masterpiece. I have never seen a director capture the truth of human emotion and rhetoric as well as Russell does in this movie (as well as in Silver Linings). It's not at all easy to make a well-structured movie that deviates from cinematic customs and formulaic dialogue, yet this movie manages seamlessly. The characters are raw as lumber and both loveable and hateable, as all humans are; nobody tips perfectly to one side of the scale, and bad movies tend to have characters who can be easily polarized into the categories of ""good"" or ""bad"". Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), epitomizes the shaky nature of context and the classification of ""good"" versus ""bad"". The movie's darkest and funniest moments alike seem to be spurred by Rosalyn's maniacal actions, which are often ill-advised beyond belief but somehow forgivable due to her inherently reasonable emotional desires in life. This movie is a flawless amalgam of crime flick and drama: the plot is wrapped around the real-life Abscam scandal (very interesting, check it out on Wiki), a 1970s FBI plot which aimed to indict Congressmen and other government officials under corruption charges through the use of a fake Arabic ""Sheik"". The story, meanwhile -- which can be notably distinguished from the plot -- is about the power of reinventing yourself. This movie falls short in neither department -- the criminal drama is nothing short of enticing, while the emotional end is a rollercoaster of laughs and tears. Also, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find Louis CK make an appearance in the movie! FYI, he did not disappoint whatsoever. On a final note, I was in love with some of Russell's musical montages. There is a part in which Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) are out dining with their wives, and the scene is an ecstatic collage of light musical dialogue, laughs, and a soft jazzy soundtrack. All in all, an excellent movie.",1448841600,,1966,5.015290519877676

What a perfect confluence of script, cast, acting, direction, cinematography, soundtrack, and editing. It is near perfect. If ever there was a raging psycho made for film it is Mr. Cooper as we have seen now twice. Mr. Bale is almost unidentifiable confirming his truly incredibility range of character acting skills. And with a twin set of equally dangerous, voluptuous, and alluring femme fatales as Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence to contend with, it weaves the final beauty into the multi-layered plots and subplots and finally exposed real plot.

6088812,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I have to say that even though I had trouble following the storyline. I had trouble distinguishing between Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper in the film. They looked so much alike that they could be brothers even twins. I wasn't sure who was Irvin or Richie. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are superb in their roles. Jeremy Renner plays Mayor Carnine Polito, the Camden mayor who loved his family, wife, and city despite being corrupt. Louis C.K. is memorable in his role and I was trying to figure out who he was throughout the film. While at times, I felt Jennifer Lawrence was miscast for the role. She was too young to play Irvin's wife, Rosalyn. Amy Adams is superb as the mistress, con-artist, and player.

The cast is superb. I enjoy the art direction, costumes, music and the actors. I just had trouble with the storyline though. I wasn't sure who was conning who at times. Perhaps it was because Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale looked more like brothers and twins than adversaries.

The DVD has two notable features such as the making of the film and the deleted and extended scenes as well. Despite some flaws, I found the film entertaining overall. I wished they included a background feature to explain the actual events that occurred. The con was called ""Abscam"" to target corrupt politicians and officials. You have to wonder what happened to the characters after the story was over.",1439424000,,1400,4.757201646090535

Christian Bale's grifter, whose profession soars when he enlists her Sydney/Edith character, gained about 90 pounds from the role he played in the movie ""The Fighter."" An ambitious, coke sniffing FBI agent played by Bradley Cooper catches them in a grift, then forces them to entrap some politicians in a take on the Ab-Scam scandal of the 1970s.

Rosenfeld, Prosser, and De Masio are actually working together towards what is supposed to be mutual professional understanding. Rosenfeld and Prosser are in love with each other. However, Rosenfeld also has a wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence) and kids at home that he also has to take into consideration. What complicates matters is that De Maso also appears to be taking romantic interest in Prosser. Irving Rosenfelds wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld is somewhat aware of her husbands life, but the movie portrays that there is still  so much she is unaware about. Bradley Cooper plays the integral role of an FBI agent who is orchestrating the talents of Sydney Prosser an Irving Rosenfeld due to their cunning ability to be professional con artists. Jeremy Renner plays a New Jersey mayor who is also caught in the web that is being weaved around a professional deal that is supposed to hold potential towards generating enormous profit.",1431216000,,1264,5.131067961165049

Jeremy Renner was also a delightful surprise - he was incredible. I would not label this movie a comedy although there are some funny scenes. Robert DeNiro brief appearance was spot on.

The sets, the music, and costumes depicting the period of the 70's was highly entertaining, and fun for myself since I can remember some things from that era.

 Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams in particular are fabulous in their portrayals.  Christian Bale plays a very likable con man involved in exposing political corruption in tough Camden New Jersey during the 1970's.

 There are many ""true crime"" films out there today that ""American Hustle"" can be placed along side of, it is very entertaining seeing such fine acting talent in action.  Two thumbs up and B+ for this film.",1426291200,2,700,4.823529411764706

It's a mix, and for every 'bad person' there is out there, there has to be someone to counteract against them, or else said person will get away scot-free. Also, the American dream, is it worth it?

Russell and lead cast from last years excellent Silver Linings Playbook, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, reconvene and add an unrecognizable Christian Bale (except for the talent!), Amy Adams (the sexiest she has ever been) and Jeremy Renner just for kicks, and the result is the best American crime film since Goodfellas.

This is a parody of the Abscam sting, and should be viewed as such although in real life people went to prison.

6089304,3,B00GMV8M2Y,A well done film and great acting all around. Bale puts a strong performance and the back and forth between Cooper and Louis Ck's characters are laugh out loud funny.

6089305,5,B00GMV8M2Y,I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. I'd watch it again.  The acting was flawless. Didn't feel like I was watching actors like so much crap out there.  Don't understand nor agree with the bad reviews,1423353600,2,194,4.676470588235294
6089306,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I would put ""American Hustle"" amongst the better great American ""crime"" or ""heist"" movies from recent years, and it deserves comparison to the best of them.  It's probably also comparable to something like ""Boogie Nights"" as an entertaining 70's-80's period piece.  The plot and particularly the characters are very well written...one of those movies where the characters and story arc get pretty crazy, but you love every minute of it.  Christian Bale plays a slightly against type character (mainly because he sports a gut) but it ends up being one of his best roles.  Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Cooper are great too, along with the rest of the supporting cast and probably my favorite is Jeremy Renner as ""the mayor.""

I don't think anyone is claiming this story is completely historical; but it is based on the FBI's real-life 70's and 80's program whereby they infiltrated organized crime and corruptness carried on by US politicians.  In ""Hustle"" the FBI has recruited two ex-con artists (played by Christian Bale and Amy Adams), using duress, to help the FBI take down some of these corrupt politicians.  That's a quick synopsis of the plot, but there's lots of twists and turns and very entertaining dynamics that develop amongst the characters

All-in-all very entertaining, and at times hilarious!",1423353600,,1307,5.074766355140187

6089308,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"This movie got so much hype and praise but honestly I don't really understand why. I'm not saying that it's a bad film, but it's not great, certainly didn't live up to all the great press that it got. The Plot itself was interesting but I felt like the whole movie was kinda going through the motions. No super stand out acting and I felt like it just fizzled out by the end. Basically, I feel like I watched it and then didn't really think about it again. Usually if a movie is good, I'll want to talk about it and I don't have much to say about ""American Hustle.""",1423180800,,565,4.1454545454545455
6089309,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" is an unapologetically glamorous, indulgent riff on classic Hollywood ensemble romps, set in the lately-resurgent so-uncool- they're-cool-again 1970s. Nearly every role, from the headliners to the bit parts to the cameos, are filled by some of the hottest, most critically-beloved actors of their generation, and they clearly relish rocking their ironically unhip (and therefore hip) comb-overs and ginormous glasses and outrageous blazers and tawdry-sexy dresses. There's no denying that the cinematography and the casting and the 70s- hits soundtrack are tailored to a tee. It screams, ""Yes, I am a Big Hollywood Movie,"" and it knows it can pull that look off and we won't roll our eyes or look away. Very well, some of us will; there are those, in the run-up to the Oscars, who are calling it Oscar bait, suggesting that it's cynically ticking off the boxes the Academy wants to see ticked: Jennifer Lawrence, check; stars ""selflessly"" obfuscating themselves behind faux-ugly makeup, check; a throwback to a time today's Oscar voters are nostalgic for, check. The movie is all the more fun to watch because it has these things. But it has more than that, plenty enough to justify the awards it's gotten and the awards it will get. It's not the main plot, which is Capers 101 with some predictable twists. It's also not the gray areas or the subtexts, which by the end are surprisingly black and white and cut and dry. The extra mile is the characterizations, huge and clear-cut personalities that are also finely-detailed and reveal new layers with each scene. Everyone is flawed, but everyone is well-intentioned, and it's hard not to like all of them even as they cultivate sleazy, selfish dislikability. The characters' tangled relationships and personal battles reduce the 200 million dollar stakes of the principle con to a secondary concern, or perhaps it is more accurate to say that they give the con meaning beyond the merely monetary. In this, screenwriters David O. Russell (who also directed) and Eric Warren Singer hit the same notes that define the Coen brothers' films, except that Russell and Singer have a softer, more sentimental touch. It's ""American Hustle""'s above-average writing, and the well-above-average acting required to sell such a script, that the Academy has recognized, and not just the movie's in-vogue surface qualities and shiny package.",1423180800,3,2393,5.170103092783505

In the beginning it said ""Some of this actually happened ...."" At the end, the usual disclaimer was made ... any parallels to reality are 'purely coincidental'. So which is it?  The entrapment defense was a minor side show, and the movie really in my view avoided that whole issue, solidifying stings as appropriate and legal. Only the repeated references to ""reality"" and ""what is real?"" touched on that theme. So much more could have been done with the time period and the controversies, but the budget went to locations and costumes. And where was the disco? It was the 1970s. Big hair, gas lines, Chevettes, and tall klunky heel shoes even on men. Many scenes in the movie trailer were absent from the film. I'd give the trailer, and its ability to make one want to see the film, at least 4 stars. The movie disappointed me.",1422835200,,949,4.716867469879518

While I admire the acting, and have no complaints with the actors; it is obvious that the writers, directors and producers had no idea of what the story was and where they wanted it to go.
Frankly, I'm still waiting for the movie industry to come up with some good movies and scripts.  Last year I went to the movies 4 times and waited on everything to come out on DVD before I spent money.  Ten years ago, I was at the movies probably 30 times and 20 years ago ... almost every week.

6089427,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Well, it is a rare thing to capture the spirit of an age and yet director David O. Russell has done that with this film. Give Russell credit; even if you didn't live through the decade, the movie's manic energy made you want to. The movie's plot involves the FBI's Abscam political corruption probe, which really isn't that important and it is best if you don't follow the plot too closely. If you do then you'll miss out on one of the best con movies to come out in many years. Honestly, we need to thank Russell for not taking the subject seriously (oh, how the movie could've dragged if he did). Instead, Russell infuses the film with an upbeat swagger that only a few films have equaled, such as The Sting (1973, George Roy Hill), Ocean's Eleven (2001, Steven Soderbergh), and The Hoax (2006, Lasse Halstrom). Russell has a stock company of actors with Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Christian Bale, and Amy Adams who would probably go to the moon for him if he asked. Examples: Cooper dons jerry-curls, Lawrence wears sweet yet smelly fingernail polish, Bale inhabits a pot belly and intense comb over, and Adams delivers a less-than-effective British accent. It's a toss-up who puts-in the best performance, but my vote is for Bradley Cooper. Cooper does get better and better in every movie he's in. Born to lose; he plays a hotshot FBI agent who harbors delusions of grand career climbing, but stumbles over his own ambitions. It almost sounds Shakespearean yet more fun. A notable instance of frustration includes Adams' annoying faux-British accent, which went in and out at both the right and wrong times and nowhere this year will you find a better opening scene.",1420934400,,1679,4.77319587628866
6089428,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"Good acting by Bale. Just his character alone was worth seeing it. I did not care to much to the show. I just dug his character and his effort. Rest of show had lots potential, what ruined it for me was the roles and characters of two other actors, I forget their name, but it was Amy Adama and the gentleman actor who payed an FBI officer, that relationship was silly, awkward, confusing, dull, over the top and ruined th rest of the show for me.",1420675200,,447,4.209302325581396

6089667,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"I tried twice to watch this, after all, it got so many Oscar attention. I came in on different scenes hoping it'd get better. It didn't. It wanted to be ""Goodfellas"" , ""Wolf Of Wall Street"", but didn't come close. Very, very amateurish directing, seemed like no script, just ad-llibbed screaming at each other, bad casting ( couldn't see past J. Lawrence's humongous cheeks!) I think if Scorsese had directed this, it would have been entertaining.",1417305600,,447,4.894736842105263
6089668,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I love this film.  It has plot twists, tricky situations, and a lot of pressure building up for our protagonists, who aren't really what they seem.  The soundtrack is excellent, as are the costumes.  The hustle/con is convincing for me.  I know there are detractors who think it's not very significant.  I get caught up in the moment every time I watch it.  The one annoying thing is Jennifer Lawrence, who seems inauthentic.  i think she was miscast.  Christian Bale is so impressive, how he inhabits this role and you lose track of the fact that he is Christian Bale - he is authentically playing his role - which is not an easy role to play.  I was expecting it to be a light film, but there is disappointment, compromise, and struggle all around.",1417305600,,750,4.537313432835821
6089669,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Oh my god...  I watched ""American Hustle"" pop-eyed and mystified from scene one as Bale did his ""hair"" and never quit.  Whoever edited this film is a genius.  It moves, moves, moves and delights at every frame.  The top five actors came to work with a dedication you'll seldom see in Hollyweird these days...  ""Hustle"" is quirky, sad, glad, combative, full of betrayal, full of ruined dreams, double reverse double crosses and hoots at every turn.  Jennifer Lawrence is beyond sublime in her acting, looks and quirks in this drama.  One of the BEST movies of the last ten years, that's for sure.  I've heard a bunch of people bad-mouth this movie and say they don't ""get it""...  Best they slide back to the comic book series and take a big breath and forget this masterpiece.  Bradley Cooper gets reinvented here.  Amy Adams is unreal from her split open dress to those cunning eyes.  The mayor - Jeremy Renner - is perfectly cast and gives a command performance.  But it's Bale who kills in this one.  Honest to god I did NOT know it was Bale until 3/4 of the way through the film and I hollered so loud my girlfriend thought I went insane!  His bald spots, his comb-over, his shyster Elvis glasses, his big belly, his stumbling ways, faltering heart - NEVER KNEW IT WAS HIM until it hit me like a lightning clap!  The dude is the new DeNiro - the new ""Raging Bull""....  Casting was unreal and the director got every screaming ounce of talent out of this crew - the hottest actors working in Hollyweird today.  It's a movie you could watch twice a year and LOVE and then explain it to your film challenged friends.  And folks, that's the definition of a CLASSIC.",1417305600,,1663,4.501672240802676

Goodness - even DeNiro pops up in an unbilled but instantly recognizable 'cameo' - the trademark voice is always a give-away.  Weight-gain [or loss]; bad hair, prosthetics, and other accoutrements should NEVER be mistaken for acting ...... only Lon Chaney and Shelley Winters could somewhat pull that off, and it DOES seem to be a trend today [including racial disguise] to grab awards simply due to disguising 'bad acting' under a veneer of physical distortion.

ONLY Amy Adams seems to be able to pull this one off - but her eternal vulnerability is beginning to wear thin ........ the dialogue [?] is endless .... the thespians rattle on and on and on ....... Newman and Redford fared so much better 40 something years ago - 'The Sting' .... The main problem with this 'movie' is that no one really cares a jot about these misbegotten fools ..... very similar to an pimply teen discovering constant self-gratification ....

WHEN one walks away from 'a movie' vividly remembering a distracting 'comb-over'; 'cleavage' and/or eccentric hair-style it's NOT performance - it distracts from what should have been 'performance'.

Art Direction / Costume?  Reflective of the tiresome disco-era and sweaty polyester .....

6089736,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle is a comedy-drama of a crime genre that is loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 1970's and 1980's. The story is about two con artists that were forced to work with an FBI agent to capture a sting operation.

During the 70's and the 80's,a ring of crooked deals were captured on video by the FBI at the backdrop of New Jersey. That led to almost a dozen arrests of U.S. senators, members of the U.S. House of Representatives and other politicians. Ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso forces the aid of the a con artists pair:Irving Rosenfeld, a small-time criminal who deals in stolen and faked art as well as fake loan scams; and his seductive British partner Sydney Prosser,who is also known as Lady Edith Greensly. The pair are forced to assist the FBI in nabbing other con artists and crooks in the area after being caught in one of his cons by DiMaso. When a chain of evidence mounts that leads towards corruption in the office of Mayor Carmine Polito, DiMaso concocts a scam that will ultimately bring down many politicians that includes Polito himself. Disgusted by their forced employment with DiMaso after he discovers mob ties that may ultimately lead to his own death,Irving and his partner make a ploy to begin a scheme of their own to get out from it. What makes matters worse is the fact that Irving's wife,Rosalyn tries desperately to retain Irving's affection and attention by constantly interfering with him.

This is definitely one of the best films during its year of release. The performances of Christian Bale,Amy Adams,Bradley Cooper and most especially Jennifer Lawrence are definitely great and memorable. They played their characters interestingly and passionately as they were able to switch from comedy to drama with ease. Also,they obviously researched their characters very well. No wonder that all of them were nominated for an Oscar. Added to that,the movie has lots of fun and energy as it was engaging from beginning to end. Added to that,the killer 70's soundtrack definitely made it enjoyable as well. Despite lacking intelligence and the unevenness of the story,the viewer will definitely get their money's worth with the heartwarming performances of the lead stars alone.",1416614400,,2233,4.952

6089740,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Quick story recap: A con artist, Christian Bale, meets his mate and match, Amy Adams, and together they do lots of jobs until they are busted in a sting operation.  They are forced to help the government bust bigger fish to get out of trouble.  Though everyone in  the movie are bad people doing bad things, I still liked them.  At times you need to have a suspension of belief at certain events which were put in there for dark humor while i realized those parts couldn't  be real in any reality I was entertained by them. The movie is however very loosely based on true events. I think the only true part being the means in which government operated it's sting operation in the 70s.

 I loved the acting. Christian Bale was great. Amy Adams was great. Jennifer Lawrence was great.

Overall, I was very entertained.  The dark humor with the mind games and the relationships between characters kept me into it until the end.",1416355200,,924,4.518072289156627

Just show me something original, fresh, CREATIVE (as opposed to commercial), and ENTERTAINING. So why so many negative reviews? Because when you do something creative and original, a lot of people just don't get it. Not enough special effects, explosions, or graphic violence for the typical jaded movie goer.

6089776,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"One of the few movies I truly enjoyed going to at the movies back in 2013. Christian Bale went above and beyond to bring to life his troubled and conflicted character and Jennifer Lawrence shined as his messed up wife. Jennifer has a lot going ahead of her and this movie shows, among the many others she's starred in that she is one of the fastest rising talents in Hollywood. The movie is a lot of fun with other big name stars like Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams. Set around one of the most stunning scandals to rock the USA in the 70s, this movie is non-stop fun from beginning to end. In fact, the real FBI operation ABSCAM was a bore but, this movie manages to make it second nature and let the great talents of its main cast to carry the plot with their incredible performance.",1415836800,,797,4.32

6089876,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle, loosely based on the late 1970s Abscam political scandal with a social story added to puff it up, is one of the greatest films of this era and easily the best film Hollywood has produced since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B004SIP90G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>. To recite the reasons why this film attains such Olympian levels would take a dissertation; I'll try to do it in a few paragraphs.

-- Acting of the principal roles. To say American Hustle if full of stars is like saying 9/11 was a national disaster. The acting of the principal and supporting roles is universally insightful and credible, beginning with Christian Bale who turns in the best work of his career, full of subtlety and nuance yet laced with over-the-top emotions. He is equaled by the star-turn of Jennifer Lawrence, America's hottest actress who is undoubtedly this era's version of Barbara Stanwyck or Susan Hayward. Watch Hayward's Academy Award-winning performance in 1958's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Want-To-Live/dp/B000RLGIQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Want To Live</a>&nbsp;and convince yourself this isn't Lawrence playing that role. Her acting is at over often over the peak emotionally and lacks subtlety, but that will come with age and experience. At age 24, she is already among the greatest female stars and is destined for further greatness in the years to come. Amy Adams, one of the best supporting actresses in Hollywood, also is the best here she's ever been, expanding her resume with a sexual performance far from the buttoned down roles of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doubt/dp/B006RXPTNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doubt</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Julie-Julia/dp/B002VXGW2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Julie & Julia</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere. Bradley Cooper, who helped fund the film, is far more effective than in his last film with many of these actors,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Linings-Playbook/dp/B00BZAJMWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Linings Playbook</a>, as are the supporting actors from Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito down to Robert DeNiro appearing unbilled. Few films with such star power achieve anywhere near the orgiastic heights of American Hustle.

-- Universally wonderful and credible acting is always a result of direction, so equal marks to director Mark Russell.

-- Next on my list is the camerawork that captures every actor in extreme close-up at one time or another, revealing their humanity and transcending what could have been cardboard cut-outs instead of flesh and blood people. Watch Jennifer Lawrence's make-up when Pete Musane (Jack Huston) wipes away her tears after her confrontation with husband Bale when she reveals to the mob what's really going on. Or stay tuned for Bale's carefully nuanced sideways glances throughout, always caught in close up. Remarkable camerawork throughout is among the most distinguishing landmark's of this awesome movie.

-- A script, partially based in reality, that moves at laser speed, rarely giving you a chance to catch your breath, while also telling a compelling story about greed, incompetence, lust, family life, loyalty and the sidebar we love to see on the screen these days, the Mafia. Never does this script let us down, whether it's telling the story of Abscam, the real-life political scandal of the 1970s, or the made up story about a scammer-art dealer-laundry owner and his complicated relationships with a family, girlfriend, loan marks, the FBI and all the other slime that comes into contact with his life. The script gets an A-plus and is nearly as good as the Coen's Western metaphor, No Country for Old Men.

-- Danny Elfman's musical score, featuring lots of real-life 1970s hits and even an occasional hit from the 1960s -- White Rabbit is from 1967 -- endorses the period and its excesses to a capital T.

-- Production values and editing makes a film with lots of drama and negative content into a joy to watch from the opening to closing scenes. Instead of being repelled at the shenanigans of these hucksters and their ties to organized (and disorganized) crime, we revel in joy from scene to scene watching these characters in our voyeuristic pattern of living a second life as a bystander to the history being portrayed on the screen.

-- Art direction, costume design, look and feel. Compare this movie, which accurately depicts the late disco era, to the failure in art design, costuming, hair and makeup of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Days-Of-Disco/dp/B00BFQ21ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Days Of Disco</a>, a 1990s fantasy about 1979, to see how this aspect of filmmaking can make the difference between a movie of greatness and one of mediocrity.

I watch 30 movies a month and rarely do I see one where all the elements come together so well to create such a wonderful atmosphere of entertainment. American Hustle is sure to be watched as long as people watch movies and can take its place in the pantheon of social misfit-crime dramas that began with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B001GJ19F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>&nbsp;and have carried into modern times through the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodfellas/dp/B001EBWISG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodfellas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino/dp/B0019IMVDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-the-Irishman/dp/B0055QLAAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill the Irishman</a>&nbsp;and No Country for Old Men. If it isn't clear by now, I heartily endorse your purchase, rental, download or theft of American Hustle.

Having seen this film about a dozen times, I would now say it is the best film I have seen in the 21st century, besting the two others I know that tower above all others -- The Pianist and No Country For Old Men.",1413331200,,6327,6.271576524741081

This time the idea makes perfect sense.  Do you want to see a movie that combines outstanding acting, tight direction and a deft, clever and believable script?  You have found the movie of the week, and perhaps the movie of the year.  Stay tuned for the Oscar awards.
 The ensemble cast of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence received the rare accolade of nominations-in order-for best actor, best actress, best supporting actor and best supporting actress.  Can you name a film in which the cast got the nod for all four major acting awards?  (Answer below)  A careful look at each individual performance reveals that the cast well deserves each and every nomination.  Lawrence, at age 23, now has three nominations and thus far one win to her credit.  Amazing.  Bale is nearly unrecognizable, so thoroughly has he transformed his visual self.  Amy Adams shuns her nice girl next door image fine tuned in Trouble with the Curve and turns herself into a brilliant, very sexy con artist.  Cooper plays a driven, ambitious, over reaching FBI agent so well that we are disgusted, appalled and intrigued by his character.
 David O. Russell (who wrote and directed last years superb Silver Linings Playbook-also with Cooper and Lawrence and for which Lawrence received the Academy Award for Best Actress- and also wrote and directed the Gulf War film Three Kings) both wrote and directed American Hustle.  The film is loosely modeled on the ABSCAM sting operation that in the end netted several congressmen, a mayor and a senator in New Jersey.  Try to imagine how brilliant a writer must be to fashion a moving love story worked around an FBI sting.  Russell got nominations for best director and for best original screenplay.  Sharing the writing credits is Eric Warren Singer who also scripted the medium warm thriller The International.
 The film overall, which I found completely satisfying and give four enthusiastic saw blades, received the nomination for best picture.
 American Hustle cost a modest $40 million to make but has already raked in over four times that amount at the box office.  When we viewers justly reward for excellence, my heart leaps.  It encourages others to produce wonderful films for us to watch.  It carries an R rating for language and adult situations but thankfully has none of the excesses that spoiled Wolf of Wall Street for many viewers.  We also get good time value, the film lasts for two hours and 18 minutes.
 In 2012 Silver Linings Playbook took nominations for all four acting top slots, best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay.  David O. Russell knows his stuff.",1409443200,,2792,4.937768240343348

I'm young(ish) - 38 yrs old, with good hearing, but there seems to be a godawful trend among young hyped actors these days and that's to try to emulate the quick-fire repartee style speech of the - say - Scorcese actors of the past (De Niro, Pesci et al) by speaking just as fast, but often ineptly stumbling over words and basically...mumbling.  Why is no director pulling them up on this?  It was also a problem Johny Depp had.  Hey, Bradley Cooper - you're not 'quickfire', you have no sonic projection!

6090287,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld, along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild FBI agent named Richie DiMaso. DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power-brokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Carmine Polito is the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down.

The cast led by Christian Bale (in another terrific performance as Irving Rosenfeld), Bradley Cooper (just as impressive as Richie DiMaso, also executive produced the film), Amy Adams (superb as Sydney Prosser), Jeremy Renner (excellent as Carmine Polito) & Jennifer Lawrence (in another impressive and terrific performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld) is brilliant. The directing by David O. Russell (also wrote the story & screenplay) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Russell & Eric Warren Singer (also executive produced the film) is brilliant.

The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren is brilliant. The film editing by Alan Baumgarten, Jay Cassidy & Crispin Struthers is brilliant. The casting by Lindsay Graham & Mary Vernieu is brilliant. The production design by Judy Becker is brilliant. The art direction by Jesse Rosenthal is brilliant. The set decoration by Heather Loeffler, set dressings by Christopher Analoro, Chris Centola, Deborah Kehs, Adam Roffman & Jeffrey Schneider is brilliant. The costume design by Michael Wilkinson is brilliant. The prosthetic make-up effects by Wesley Wofford are brilliant. The special effects coordinated by John Ruggieri is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Ryan Suchor & Liz Vogtsberger, supervised by Sean Devereaux, Tim LeDoux, Marc D. Rienzo, Edson Williams & Danny Yoon is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Ben Bray & Frank Torres is brilliant.

This is a brilliant and well-crafted film that is entertaining and intriguing, as well as interesting. David O. Russell directs another brilliant and impressive film to add his resume. Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner & Jennifer Lawrence give impressive performances and also impressively lead a brilliant cast, as well. This was one of the best movies of the last winter season and was also one of the best movies of last year (an awards contender, on top of it), as well.",1407628800,,2518,5.353535353535354

6090411,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"There is very little that I can add to 1500+ reviews of American Hustle, but I can add a few points that should be kept in mind.

a) The fact that the film garnered no Academy Awards points to the fact that genre-bending, ensemble-cast films with a fresh voice and a fresh look have difficulty competing with more traditional films.

b) The film is very, very long.  Silver Linings Playbook, e.g., is far less ambitious as a film, but it is tighter and, with all its quirkiness, far more conventional.

c) The score is sensational and it works very well with the narrative arcs of the film.  Jeff Lynne, Steely Dan, Chicago, Duke Ellington,  Ella Fitzgerald, et al. may simply not be sufficiently chic for contemporary Academy voters, despite their magic.

d) The hair, makeup, and costuming are stunning.  The slightly-over-the-top 70s look is done to perfection.

e)  While the overall plot arcs eventually result in something magical, this is a movie that consists of brilliant scenes.  While the dialogue is sometimes a bit literary it is no less magical.

f) The individual performances are uniformly stellar and even with its massive ambitions they manage to add up to more than the sum of their parts, despite the fact that the film is very long and a little creaky in the joints.

g)  The cast and crew deserve our appreciation for attempting to do something quirky on the grand scale.  We need fresh, imaginative filmmaking that shatters the categories and breaks the molds.  This is not a perfect movie but it is a superb bit of entertainment.

h)  Dont miss it, but allow lots of time to absorb and enjoy it.",1406332800,,1619,4.701067615658363

That it doesn't, bodes bad for the film and suggests the film is going to be incoherent and reckless, a verdict that is quickly confirmed.  The opening 30"" of dialogue was a hodge-podge and Sydney's character (played by Amy Adams) then went every which way, and having her bob around histrionically adds to the film's incoherence.  Which man was she after?  What qualities was she looking for?  Was she mad?  A scene that represents the manic ugliness of the entire film for me is the toilet stall scene, where Cooper and Adams veer toward copulation in the tiny stall.  Why in the the world was this particular scene devised and thrust upon us?  Answer: this is the primitivism the director is good at scattering about and droves of people love it.  It's a trademark capsule of a wild, chaotic and quirky pattern devoid of maturity that critics have termed ""thrilling"".

What follows are adoring excerpts gathered from newspaper reviews on imdb.  Except for a few brackets in the form of [ ], what follows is critics' praise in their own words.  It's clear what they dote on: intensity and unending sensation. I see their terms of reference as on a collision course with cinema as we know it from LOLITA,  GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING,  PAN'S LABYRINTH,  LOURDES (with Sylvie Testud) + the calm, poised, thought provoking treatment of life and its mysteries in MUD (unfortunate title) and other films that'd now be jeered at --- as too staid, slow or not spastic enough --- not to mention too lacking in a steady stream of obscenities.

Here's the first adoring excerpt.  In this excerpt and those to follow, note the qualities that send the critics into ga-ga land.

""Its great -but then again, was a film that features Jennifer Lawrence over-zealously cleaning to the strains of Live and Let Die ever going to be anything other than great?""  [Can the critic actually MEAN this???]

""Each of the main characters are their own individual wells of entertainment, with their plethora of bizarre ticks.  Whilst it occasionally feels muddled from the sheer wealth of characters, the off the wall intensities and surprises are thrilling.""

""He takes four entirely preposterous characters, who take themselves entirely seriously: they begin to enact something like a dysfunctional four-way comedy routine, or perhaps a challengingly atonal modern jazz quartet. They are people who hate and love each other, and everyone often seems on the point of screaming .  .  .  .  "". [A key to the film's popularity?]

""The pressure-cooker simmer of suppressed madness bubbles continuously through American Hustle .  .  .  .  .""

""The bizarre, uproarious and semi-credible story rattles along with plenty of comic setpieces along the way. Richie is infuriated by his tightass boss Stoddard Thorsen, played by Louis CK, who is reluctant to use official funds for his crazy entrapment schemes and keeps on telling him a homely anecdote about his childhood ice fishing, which Richie keeps petulantly interrupting when he thinks he understands the moral. It is a running gag, punctuated by furious rows and there is even a psychotic flashback in which the two appear to be pulling guns on each other in some scuzzy bathroom: did that really happen? Or just in Richie's head?""  [Many critics swallowed this cunning bait and were diverted by this nit wit running gag and had to describe it at length.]

""The performances are far from subtle, yet they have an eye-popping, beads -of-sweat commitment.""  [ Exactly --- INTENSITY trumps all else..  ""Far from subtle"".  ""Eye-popping, beads of sweat [performances].""  Yes, this critic has nailed it.  It's another way of saying INTENSITY, via mini- shocks from the roller coaster taking curves abruptly, jerkily and in ""shake em up"" fashion.  Lace heavily with extreme emotional states, circumstances pushed to the limit, profanity & cleavages and you have a winning formula for one and all.  Well, for a great number, anyway.

I so much prefer recent films that are calm and collected:  THANK YOU FOR SMOKING,  AN EDUCATION,  BURN AFTER READING,  and (yes!) MUD.  I feel vulgarized and knocked around by this film.",1406073600,,4518,4.970627503337783

6090448,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Unlike its predecessor Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle is a slow-cooking picture. It takes a long time to get going, and doesnt really explain where were going, but once we start rolling it becomes a cinematic dream.

The exposition, weirdly, is the film at some of its clunkiest. Maybe its the gradual, deliberate pacing or the oddly deafening silence (we don't get the stellar soundtrack til about halfway through), but something about it feels uninvolving. The con scheme set up by Irving and Sydney (later Edith) doesnt really make sense, and this disconnect makes it hard to stay interested and engaged with whats going down.

The intervention of FBI Agent Richie DiMaso, played to perfection by Bradley Cooper (who, in just two films, has become one of my favorite contemporary actors), is the first great curveball thrown at the lead duo. They get caught for their scheme and, in a similarly selfish fashion, he bets the odds in his favor and pushes them to topple greater and greater idols, not for Justice but for his own reputation.

The film is often patchy, alternating between sequences of nap-worthy doldrums and truly fantastic filmmaking. My favorite moments are the soundtrack-heavy ones, such as the disco nightclub scene (one of the best Ive ever seen) and the montage of arrests at the films climax. Its extraordinary how the glorious 70s soundtrack really raises the impact from watching a dime-a-dozen crime caper to this sublime, awe-inspiring cinematic experience. Its like watching the greatest music video that was never made.

Other highlights, it goes without saying, are those featuring the unforgettable Jennifer Lawrence.  She plays the classic, genre-perfect crazy New Jersey wife with a bitchy honesty that never feels over-the-top or flamboyant. She exercises such remarkable control yet leaves a lasting screen presence, its hard to remember she is in the movie so little compared to the other main characters.

This films greatest strength, though, is in its unique brand of messaging. The Wolf of Wall Street (which I actually prefer) does have some line between right and wrong, even if that line is dotted and hard-to-read, American Hustle has no such line at all. Who of any of these characters, is good? Who is wholly unselfish? I love to see this kind of challenging storytelling, where there is no one really doing the right thing, and everyone is working an angle. Hollywood is often too timid to make a movie as cynical as this, and I applaud David O. Russell for having the guts to.

While it has some narrative issues and clunks along at times, it is an often-entertaining movie that delivers some unforgettable movie moments. Love it or hate it, people will be talking about American Hustle for years to come.",1405987200,2,2766,5.0130718954248366

6090467,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams in one film.

Only a fool would say this film wasn't worth viewing by looking at the trailer cause I'll tell you what, the trailer is outstanding. However there are so many co-ordinates to this film. Other than introducing me to an Arabeque White Rabbit, the film kind of re-introduced me to Amy Adams. The plot is simple but the direction wears you out to the extent you sense the film's loss. This is one of those rare films with a thunderous cast yet it leaves you feeling mixed emotions.

There is no doubt in my mind that American Hustle had its moments but the overall product left me feeling a bit thwarted and reminded me of my own self importance as the audience. You see, it tested with its own temperament by temperament. Does anyone else feel they would have done so much better with a better director? Imagine a Martin Scorsese on this set, he would make it so much more thick. Or imagine Ron Howard doing this film, he would make it lovely.

I personally think there are two reasons the film failed and one of those two reasons is Bradley Cooper's character. He is my favourite out of the four actors. Christian Bale had no reason to be bald eventually the film looked gimmicky because of these little dumb things it tried. Jennifer Lawrence won an award for this? The world's been too kind to that young woman.

Unsung hero of the movie? Amy Adams
Will I watch it again? Yes, as a casual re-watch for those moments.

You know that saying ""time flies when you're having fun?"" Well, during this movie time was shot down, plummeted hundreds of yards, and began to try to crawl away.
The most disappointing part for me was all the hype this movie received. I began watching it with high hopes and those hopes were utterly crushed by the time I gave up and turned it off.
Sure, this movie started off slow but then again, many movies do. The difference is, most movies pick up speed and intensity as it goes on. This film crawled along until it ran out of breath. Then it began crawling again.
This movie was completely unbearable. I'd say it's more of a documentary than anything else. A lot of the beginning half was mostly just narrarated. No dialogue; just narrations.
Even if there was no plot at least there's Jennifer Lawrence right? Hardly.
I'm not sure what I started off trying to say but what it all boils down to is this: the movie was slow, boring, and lacked meaningful dialogue.

BUT . . . some of you will HATE it.  Why?  Well, let's be honest: this movie moves at a steady, turtle's pace with much of the entertainment coming from the character interaction.  If you do NOT like watching the subtle back and forth between characters, the exchange of meaningful glances, thoughtful dialogue, or scenes without urgency, do NOT see this film.

It is a character-driven hybrid that reminds me of Goodfellas at times, Casino at times, the Usual Suspects at times, etc.

American Hustle is its own theatrical beast, though.  Thoughtful, mysterious, tense, and funny!  To merge all of those qualities successfully is a BIG accomplishment.

You can relate to every character.  The cast is incredible--not just the stars on the cover.  You are going to see a lot of talent in this film.

Watch for a breakout, subtly hilarious performance by Louis C.K.  And, no matter what you do, rent it for the first scene during which Bale's character fixes his hair and another character intervenes soon after.  Hilarious.  :)",1405036800,,1287,5.115942028985507

6090596,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Ok. Yes, this is the third film in a row that I've reviewed that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. It's just that I've been having a marathon of some sort. Also of note is that the date this review is published befalls my birthday. Happy Birthday to Me! Even though I'm writing this a month or so in advance, it's still nice to write. 'American Hustle' was one of those Academy Award Best Picture nominees I most wanted to view myself. I'll be honest when I say that back in August 2013 when the first trailer for the film came out, I was not interested at all. And then later on I watched the second trailer and started to get interested. It's the costumes and cast that really got me attached. It looked like a film that puts you in the 70's and I'm glad to note it does. Now let's read my review of 'American Hustle'.

'American Hustle' follows Irving Rosenfeld (Played by Christian Bale) a businessman who operates a small business of dry-cleaning shops. But Irving's greatest business success was as a con man operating a fake money lending scheme, to fool people into handing him 5,000 dollars for credits. He has a wife and child as well. After meeting and falling in love with Sydney Prosser (Played by Amy Adams), a big dreaming, smart girl, Irving asks her to join him in his operation. But the two are soon busted by senile and aggressive FBI agent Richard DiMaso (Played by Bradley Cooper) who forces the two to con the Mayor Carmine Polito (Played by Jeremy Renner) or face jail time. But things go too far with the two whining up attracting the attention of the mob.

'American Hustle' is a very interesting film. But the most interesting thing is the characters. Some of them start out cool and end up being a steam pot. The characters are relatable and well fleshed out throughout the bloated 2 hours and 10 minutes runtime. Usually when you watch a movie, the characters are more of a side dish, with the action the main course, and it hurts the film in many ways. But this is obviously not the case with this film. We are given emotionally acceptable characters, characters you hate, characters you love. Highly realistic characters with motives for their actions and interesting back stories. We feel their desperation and anger and fear.

Director 'David O. Russell' dives into this crime cape masterfully. Coming off the critical successes of 'Silver Lining Playbook' and 'The Fighter' O. Russell get's inside the story, delivering ripe camerawork and giving us hearty characters, characters that we connect with solely because of O. Russell's direction.

But I feel the film lagged in the third act before finally coming to a close. The film feels like 3 hours rather than 2. It includes loads of excess that would have served the film better if it had been cut and left on the cutting room floor. I suggest removing a few nice but rather un-necessary scenes involving DiMaso and his boss (Played by Louis C.K) as well as a scene involving DiMaso at his home, which I felt did nothing to progress the story in anyway. O. Russell is a director who is overly talented but can't seem to leave anything out.

The cast is what really makes this film glimmer. 'Christian Bale' coming off the success of the Batman Trilogy plays Irving. He performs the anger, confusion, and smarts that came with the character. He was able to move the story along. 'Amy Adams' shines as Sydney. Her fake British accent is perfect and her performance is remarkably convincing as the clever and decidedly beautiful woman. 'Bradley Cooper' surprisingly pulls off the dramatic role as the somewhat senile detective. I have to give him a tip of the hat, when I say he really puts some effort into the role, and overshadows Bale in the shots they share together. 'Jeremy Renner' plays the sweet mayor, and really pulls off the powerful and very much likable character he plays. I felt sorry for him at the end and felt Renner made the best of his screentime. Also during the end we get a very surprising (and delighting) uncredited cameo from 'Robert De'Niro' as a very powerful mob boss, who plays the tension high and convincing, and gave me a small smirk every time I saw him on screen.

The costumes and hair styling is also pretty elegant. Sydney's curly hair is pretty fashionable to the period, and her flashy and scandalous clothing is quite beautiful to look at. Irving himself sports a nice hairdo, as does the agent, DiMaso in a short cut curly hairdo as well. The costumes were well selected and fit the period well. The hairdos were well done and also fit the period well and look really cool as well.

All and All 'American Hustle' is a smart film with top notch performances, solid characters, great directing, and even if the film is a bit too long, it's still entertaining. B- 4/7/14

'American Hustle' is rated R for pervasive language, some sexual content and brief violence. It's appropriate for ages 14 and up.",1404691200,,4944,4.642285714285714

6090700,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"A lot of talent working hard in this movie, but only with sporadic success.  One of the biggest names, Robert De Niro, has an uncredited cameo, and unkind though it might be to say, I think his decision to keep his name off the credits was a wise one.  The problem is with the rhythm and direction -- there are scenes that seem either unnecessary or to go on to long.  For example, the scene with the agents who believe that they have just taped an incriminating phone call is probably not needed, but certainly goes on far too long.  The scene with Richie (Bradley Cooper) and Sydney (Amy Adams) in the bathroom stall adds nothing to our grasp of these characters or to the plot.  The running gag of Richie's boss (Louis C. K.) and the ice-fishing story is weak and unnecessary  The big party scene involving the sheikh and the mobsters -- way too long.  Carmen Polito, mayor of Camden, NJ, goes on and on about how his constituents are his family, long after we get it.  The energy of the actors and the excellent production values aren't enough to save these scenes, and they throw the rhythm out of kilter.

George Roy Hill's ""The Sting"" ran like clockwork -- like the sting itself.  This is a sort of sting movie, and (thanks to Rosalyn [Jennifer Lawrence], the wife of con-man Irving Rosenfeld [Christian Bale]) the sting DOESN'T run like clockwork -- but the movie should, and it doesn't.  The con artists, Irving and Sydney, are constantly having to adapt to unforeseen circumstances -- and there is a possibility of humor in that -- but the adjustments aren't always as funny as they could be.  There is a certain satisfaction in the ending's showing that folks who have to con for a living are better at it than the government, but I'm not sure that that makes up for the dull patches on the way.  I think that Cooper, Adams, Lawrence, and Bale -- as well as Jeremy Renner, who plays Carmine Polito -- are fine, and some local scenes work well enough, but not enough of them.

Viewers shouldn't expect a satire on the level of ""M.A.S.H."" or ""Network.""  Despite the title ""American Hustle"" it's not clear that there's anything specifically American in the targets of such satire as there is beyond the setting.  Somewhere in the background, and signaled early, there's a point being made about self-invention and re-invention (this is, I think, what all the stuff about everybody's hair is all about), but it hardly deserves the name of cultural criticism.  Further, the cartoonishness of the characterization distances us from the characters' predicaments, but they are not reduced to social or culturally recognizable types in a way that would enable us to say confidently that this or that aspect of the culture is being satirized.

So what's to like?  The energy of the acting is engaging; De Niro's brief moment is gripping and well-paced; there's a great late 1970's soundtrack, and the '70's look is faithfully recreated -- but these alone didn't redeem the movie as a whole for me.  So . . . it's OK, but a bit tiresome, I'm afraid.",1403395200,,3049,4.64245810055866

6090772,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" was inspired by the Abscam operation of the early 1980s, in which the FBI entrapped a number of politicians -Congressmen and one US Senator among them- for taking bribes from wealthy Arab businessmen in return for political favor. The operation proved controversial when it became public, and the FBI was accused of overstepping its authority in creating crimes rather than investigating them. ""American Hustle"" draws on that criticism of the FBI to create a narrative that is downright distrustful of authority and goes so far as to elevate crooks and con artists to the status of anti-heroes. Makeup, wardrobe, and atmosphere steeped in 1970s pop culture, flamboyant behavior, and a strong cast combine to make this an enjoyable darkly comic grift film.

Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) outgrew his family dry cleaning business and found success dealing in stolen and forged art and loan sharking before he met his match in Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an ambitious young New Yorker with a flair for English accents and manipulation. Together, they set up a loan scam to dupe clients out of $5000 each. Then they were caught by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), an FBI agent with his sights always set on bigger things. In exchange for leniency, DiMaso recruits Rosenfeld and Prosser to help set up some more con artists for him to arrest. They are to deliver 4 busts to fulfill their obligation. But the operation to hook more crooked art dealers and scam artists morphs into a public corruption investigation...and spins out of control.

Although the principle characters are based on real people, Sydney Prosser didn't have anything to do with Abscam. Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), Mayor of Camden tirelessly seeking investors for Atlantic City casinos, is more law-abiding than his real-life counterpart. You get the idea. The film opens with the statement: ""Some of this actually happened."" That's more honest than the usual ""based on true events.""

Director David O. Russell is adept at slowly turning the audience's sympathies from Rosenfeld's victims and his ambitious FBI persecutor to Rosenfeld and Sydney themselves. By the end of the film, the crooks have become anti-heroes. The strong anti-authoritarian undercurrent is surprising. But the film's rejection of any moral compass is puzzling, given that the writers seem to have intended a political message in criticizing the FBI's agenda and making its agents out to be either amoral and unstable or bureaucratic and impotent. While Russell's manipulation of the audience is effective, he uses a hackneyed gimmick to elicit sympathy for Rosenfeld: Rosenfeld sacrifices his own interests so as not to lose touch with his young adopted son. A bit saccharine for a grift movie.

""American Hustle"" was widely praised by critics as one of the best films of 2013. One dissenter was Peter Debruge, who dismissed the film as ""a collection of flamboyant 1970s caricatures run amok"" and criticized its incoherence and sloppiness in ""Variety"". Other dissenting critics said much the same. I don't disagree with them. The film's flashback structure is awkward. It's too long and loaded with filler. The first half needs tighter editing. It's narratively sloppy and thematically confused. It's full of tangents that go no where. ""American Hustle"" has been overpraised. But it's fun, stylish, and the cast is admirable. Amy Adams is particularly strong and even overshadows her low-cut blouses, which are a major feature. I like the erratic interplay between Irving, Sydney, Richie, and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). This is not a masterpiece, but it's entertaining. Most of the credit should go to Amy Adams and costume designer Michael Wilkinson.",1402876800,,3732,5.2462311557788945

My two grown kids, my wife, some other friends all thought it was such a waste of cool people and great actors. I must say the trailer was pretty awesome, though, with that Led Zeppelin song playing. It felt like Goodfellas meets Pulp Fiction but without a single one of the parts that made those other two movies amazing.

The acting was phenominal. The costuming was great. But the story was so god awfully bad that nothing could save it.

It had politicians bribing the mafia (that usually goes the other way around), the mafia forgiving people who brought FBI agents into a meeting (yeah...like the mafia is real big on forgiveness for things like that...), and a mother who becomes friends with the woman who breaks up her relationship and takes her kid (which is less believable than the mafia forgiving people for the FBI thing) and that's just to name a few.

The characters are underdeveloped and have quirks for no reason. Bradley Cooper's charachter has a fiance for no apparant reason whatsoever. They can't decide if the mayor of Camden NJ character is a good honest family man who is caught in the middle of something or a down and dirty crooked politician who's in bed with the mafia.

The big set up that the main 3 characters try to pull over on everyone keeps changing. The details aren't consistant. Just all around bad film making.

Oh, and on top of all that that it's abotu an hour too long. I mean it just keeps going and going and you just want it to be over.

This movie seemed to capture the 1970's pretty well. It had a great look and the women (Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence) were beautiful. In my opinion, this movie should've won Best Picture.

Christian Bale stars as a balding con-artist named Irving Rosenfeld who meets and falls in love with Sydney Prosser, posing as English aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensly"" Sydney helps Irving with his scams. When they are caught and captured by FBI agent Richie DiMaso, they are given a choice; either go to jail or help him with 4 additional arrests. They soon get mixed up with the Mafia and many schemes where Irving is forced to involve his wife. I would definitely consider watching this movie again someday.

Having lived through the 70's I can assure you this wasn't what was going on - a caricature of low people scamming others in bad clothes.  ok I get it that it's not the point but the lack of dignity on the part of any character left me first of all not giving a rat's bottom about any of them and secondly the plot scraped bottom so loudly and jarringly that I had to turn the movie off.

After 50 minutes I couldn't watch anymore.  This film feels is a ""been there done that"" going back to Casino and so many other better done ""glam crime"" films.

I like all the actors in the movie, but they were ALL horribly miscast. Every Single Actor in this movie- terribly, horribly, distractingly miscast, I can not emphasize that enough. It made the entire movie feel forced and awkward. Add to that a hard to follow plot, shallow characterization, and disjointed scenes and you have a hot mess on a silver platter.

I actually felt bad for Jeremy Renner, Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale- they are amazing actors, but all of them were obscenely miscast. They did the best they could, but the characters they play were not fully hashed out, not at all, and Renner especially was so awkward playing an Italian mayor. He looked way too young. Not feeling it. I was also cringing with the Amy Adams character and the English accent yay or nay thing-- made me wanna say OY vay, already!

If that wasn't enough, it was overlong and just didn't make any sense in the end. I hated this movie.

Also Amy did not feel authentic to me in her role. She is a great actress but i did not see her appropriate for the role.",1401321600,,449,4.113636363636363

I was expecting a caper film but there were actually strong elements of romance, marital discord, jealousy and always the question of who is betraying who.  In the second act, it did seems to drag a bit.  The women definitely did the heavy lifting on this one.",1401321600,,308,4.368421052631579

Don't get me wrong, it's worth watching but just a bit tedious.",1401235200,,257,4.03921568627451

6091007,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"Christian Bale makes another physical transformation, Amy Adams, and her wardrobe, are a visual delight, Jennifer Lawrence is far too young for the role.  The movie is slow and plodding to start and too quick to end, leaving resolution of script points on the cutting room floor.  The ending tries to surprise, but it is not in the same league of The Usual Suspects or The Prestige.  In the end it's the audience that gets the hustle.",1401148800,,434,4.6103896103896105
6091028,4,B00GMV8M2Y,Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale are terrific.  Good story filled with subtle humor that can be missed if the viewer is not paying attention.  Watch the facial expressions and body language.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1401148800,,220,5.228571428571429
6091029,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"This movie, while a good plot was filled with stuff that should have been edited out as it contributed little or nothing to the story.

6091032,4,B00GMV8M2Y,Bale continues to impress in this multi-layered role. Great Bronx accent. Excellent script; excellent cast. Jeremy Renner makes the most of his role as the crooked NJ mayor. The film keeps you guessing. Entertaining from start to finish.,1401062400,,237,5.2631578947368425

6091034,4,B00GMV8M2Y,Jennifer is delightful as per usual. As is Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper (and I don't generally like him) however Amy Adams (increasingly) stals the show. Really this is worth it for the white dress alone. Fashionistas- youi're gonna love this. Almost as good as Mahoghany in that regard.,1400976000,,292,4.979591836734694

The whole of this movie far exceeds the sum of it's all of it's already excellent parts:  Great story, exciting pacing, tight dialog, , fabulous music -- all wrapped in stunning style. It was simultaneously emotionally moving and Marvelously funny. The entire cast right down to the minor characters was simply flawless.
American Hustle is does a really great movie should: it fearlessly takes you away on a whirlwind ride.",1400976000,,637,4.888888888888889

I decided to rent it and at the end, wasn't really impressed. The story line is brilliant; however, the amount of time it takes for that plot line to develop is ridiculous. It literally takes hours for them to develop a plot that could have been thoroughly explained in less time.

6091047,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle is a fine example of a Film, it has sublime Direction, perfect writing, and great characters backed by amazing performances, making it a brilliant period piece, so why do i like it as much as i should?
Maybe I'm too young to understand it or ""get it"", though at my age i thought i understood just about everything I'd need to enjoy movies. But i honestly can't say i enjoyed watching American Hustle, it did not entertain me, it is the textbook definition of a good movie but that is it, there's no style, no flair, i can't even tell you what genre the movie is. It could be a Crime-Comedy-Drama-Charter-Period movie, i really wanted to love american hustle, and i do... i just can't think of many good things to say about it, it was a well mad movie by all texbook definitions of how a well made movie should be made, But there's no art to it, when i see a Scorcesse or Tarantino movie i know i'm watching a scorcesse or Tarnatino movie, no one makes movies the way they do, if i wasn't a film geek i don't think i could tell you who directed this, The film is so sterilised of anything resembling a director's artistic touch that it could have been made by just about anyone
As for the Blu Ray release it's sony's usual excellence, with brilliant video and audio. the supplements are limited in number but satisfying in quality. I'm not sure if i can recommend American Hustle or Not, if you want to see how a film should be made by all mechanical definitions of film then by all means go right ahead, but if you're looking for something more auteur then i'd go with some of the other big movies of 2013 such as Her or Wolf of Wall Street",1400716800,2,1656,4.310897435897436

6091080,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"This movie lacked something that I can't quite put my finger on. It may have been that there were too many characters that were somewhat poorly developed, or that the storyline made it nearly impossible to care for/root for the primary characters. Also, I found Bradley Coopers character just plain annoying. Given the cast, perhaps I was expecting too much, but the actors are limited by the script. Overall, this was an ok movie. I didn't hate it, but I wouldnt watch it again unless it's to enjoy the 70s-tacular fashions.",1400630400,5,525,4.78021978021978

6091112,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle is not a heist move, but rather a story about complex, ambitious, and conflicted personalities in difficult situations mostly of their own creation.  These people are certainly not virtuous,  but they are not totally evil either.  However in spite of lots of acting talent the movie is slow-moving & dull.  Worst of all, it didn't make me care about any on the characters.  Bradley Cooper's character is nearly pathetic enough to be interesting, but not really.  Overall it was as though the actors and filmmaker are telling us about complicated people in complicated circumstances but never really bringing those characters or circumstances to life.  Some weak movies have merit because of at least one actor's sparkling performance.  That is not the case here.  The performances are uniformly dull, shallow, and unconvincing.  Two stars is generous.",1400544000,3,867,5.262773722627737
6091113,2,B00GMV8M2Y,Throughout the movie many time the male actor dialogue was garbled.  Some called it  a comedy it is not funny.  A tragic farce  and an exaggeration  to the extreme of gullible characters.  I found it boring,1400544000,,206,4.583333333333333

6091225,5,B00GMV8M2Y,I can't say enough about this film. It was most deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. No flaws. I don't often get excited watching a movie but I'm still revved up by this one days later.,1399939200,,185,4.166666666666667

6091247,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Amy Adams is so gorgeous, so stylish, so smart and so sexy in each and every nuance, every little twitch of her face and/or body, that every man will fall in love instantly; yet she never reveals all, reminding us of Ovid's Metamorphoses, I: 502, where the love-smitten Apollo is chasing the nymph Daphne: ""and the parts that lie hidden, he thinks even better.""  But wait, this review is supposed to be about the whole movie.  Christian Bale, whom this reviewer has always disliked, considering him somehow odious, shines here, perhaps because he plays a character whom we consider odious.  The plot doesn't seem terribly important.  It's liars telling lies to other liars; scammers scamming other scammers.  The FBI, which usually is so careful in propagating its public image, lets its hair down, literally.  The chief FBI man here, unshaven and looking and acting like a lowlife criminal himself, who lives with his mother and sets his hair in curlers at night, is nothing more than a big mouth, anxious to bring down any politician he can, by entrapment or any other means, in order to gain notoriety for himself.  This movie is not a serious drama, but a farce, unbelievable but funny much of the time.  Where else can you find a Mexican sheik, or an Italian mafia capo who speaks Arabic?  This movie doesn't end; it just peters out, and when it does, we don't care too much what happens to whom.  Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's wife is stunningly gorgeous, as is the actress playing the wife of mayor Polito.  It's a fun watch.",1399852800,2,1530,4.714285714285714

The people that really were alive in the 70s will appreciate this movie more for the throwbacks, but even a new kid or someone born in this century will find the movie entertaining. It's story plays out like a story from goodfellas, but the main guy in this movie is just an average street hustler making scraps. He somehow works his way up to ""millionaire"" deals and the funny business ensues. Back then millionaire was the most anyone could ever have, the ""B"" word was not being used yet. At some point the story was taking a back seat to J Law's two Bazingas ( O.O ) OMFG. I had to laugh at some point just because everyone was so serious about nothing.

But, I just didn't care for the story, or the movie or the characters at all. The movie left me feeling bad in a way that I can't even describe very well. I didn't like the characters or their relationships with each other. And I didn't like how the story was resolved. The entire thing left me feeling quite unsettled.

It feels like the movie drags on forever and I think it's just cause the main reason for the whole thing comes out at the very end, which unless you're paying attention, can be easily missed. I guess maybe it just wasn't my kind of movie. Great cast and what could have been a great plot but I think the fact that it was an ""era"" or time period movie kind of made it all get lost in translation.",1399593600,,470,4.064516129032258

I've watched this three times and there's still more in this film that I want to discover. I won't spoil it, but it's a love story, a ""story of survival"", and there's not a wasted scene or detail, or especially not a wasted line, in the whole thing.",1399593600,,504,4.260416666666667

The plot of this movie is just gosh awful, unbelievable and totally void of any artistic achievement.

Sometimes its nice to see people get whats coming for them.  I also thought they did a great job with the style and it was crazy to see just how much weight Bale gained to play the role (his comb-over was great as well).  Some parts of the movie were a little slow, but overall I thought they did a great job with the film.  It was entertaining, interesting, the acting was superb, there was a great deal of suspense, and the ending was fantastic.  Its the type of movie that you should definitely check out.

Bradley Coopers character was perhaps the one we cared about most but even still the whole movie just wasn't that interesting and was trying too hard to be clever - which it was not.
Christian Bale did do a great job acting but that wasn't enough to keep watching.",1399161600,3,375,4.529411764705882

It is tedious and overdone with respect to the lead characters' relationships.  i would rather watch more interaction with the politcians and their agenda's to tie the plot and motivation in more effectively.  While the topic is interesting and the characters as slimy as you would expect, it was disjointed, perhaps not well edited.  The camera slips into a somehat documentary style with ""live"" authentic looking shots, angles and the look of a hand-held camera.  Acting was quite good, believable and the makeup, costume and props all excellent for the 70's timeline.",1399161600,4,741,4.935483870967742

6091512,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"AMERICAN HUSTLE (2013) is by far the best comedy-caper film I have seen in decades!

The cast is uniformly excellent, the gags are genuinely funny, the dialogue is intelligent, and the plot twists are plausible but nearly always unforeseeable. And the film has a ""good heart""! Non-traditional, unexpected kindness and generosity triumph and leave us feeling good at the end.

Christian Bale sets the tone at the very start as Irving Rosenfeld, a world-class conman with a potbelly and the most amazing hair comb-over! Laughable as he is and crooked as he is, he and his partner-mistress Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) are made sympathetic to us by their voice-over comments that reveal their backgrounds, their goals, and their high-functioning mental processes.

Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Richie DiMaso, a hyper-ambitious curly-haired FBI agent, who lusts for Sydney Prosser and forces her and Irving to help him entrap an array of Congressmen and a New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) with a bribe-offering sting called ABSCAM.

Among many loose cannons, the biggest is Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who is receptive to the amorous advances of a powerful mobster. Will she reveal what Irving and the others are up to? Will she cause Irving to be harmed ...? Will she ...?

And, as the film approaches its ending, two of the characters decide that they will take an all-new kind of control of the whole situation. And YOUR job may be to try to spot it as it happens ... IF it is happening. Or to spot it being derailed.

As with that great comedy-caper film THE STING (1973; Robert Redford and Paul Newman), despite this explicit heads-up from these two characters, 999,999 viewers out of a million will be totally surprised by the outcome. But very pleasantly surprised if they've been paying attention.

For me, the only factor that gives THE STING a very slight advantage over AMERICAN HUSTLE is its great musical score that featured those wonderful ragtime melodies of Scott Joplin.

This film deserves a VERY strong ""A+"" grade.",1399075200,,2044,4.991176470588235

Great soundtrack too well picked out songs and score help to set the tone, if you like a smart intelligent drama with a good story its a must see, con-men, corruption and mafia are a great cocktail with such an amazing cast!

Such a different time than now but human emotion,motivations and great music come together so well it is difficult to explain. This movie has proved how talented any actor or actress of much different age than their character can make you believe and maybe think about something from both sides. This is an amazing movie that came together to tell a story of real emotion.

6091554,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"Man, was I disappointed in this movie. I was a young man in the service when ABSCAM occured, and this movie just didn't hit the mark on the whole ""feel"" of the operation's aims and the general public's view of the whole matter. But, I realize movies can be made that take a true story, and totally tell another tale when all is said and done. I don't agree with this strategy personally, and I don't understand why a movie maker would pick a story and re-tell it different from fact anyway. Why not just tell your own tale if you think it's good enough. Artistic license is one thing, but re-making a tale is another.
There was some good in this story telling though and I'm not rating the maker(s) effort on that score, just the fact that the movie wasn't really telling the tale of ABSCAM IMHO. The actors are solid as you'd expect and it seems they even get into their character's persona well enough to be convincing. If you don't know anything about ABSCAM, I'd wait until after you see the movie to research it if your inclined or curious to find out about it. I wouldn't recommend finding out first, as you will be like me and you will be ""waiting"" for certain landmarks in the story, and certain facts to surface, and certain events to happen, and it just won't happen.
I guess one could also say that it was the ABSCAM story with the focus just somewhere other than center.",1398902400,3,1382,4.381322957198444

A very fast-moving film with good, convincing actors who are not sympathetic in the conventional, movie-script way. The four principle actors in this film are out to screw each other. I bought this film mainly to see the performance of Christian Bale who is an extraordinarily gifted actor. He morphs physically into the characters he plays on screen. IMO, he deserved an Academy Award for his performance. Bradley Cooper, as the FBI agent straddling between his job as a federal agent and his part in stinging a corrupt New Jersey mayor (splendidly played by Jeremy Renner) was superb. Jennifer Hudson and Amy Adams were good in their supporting roles. My one negative comment had to do with the costumes worn by Amy Adams throughout the film. I remember the '70's but I don't recall women walking around semi-naked in broad daylight, in meetings, etc., Amy Adams could have played that role without having to display her breasts in every scene.

The Love Quadrangle is complex and ever-shifting. We (my wife and I watched and commiserated together) don't have anything to validate this opinion, but we suspect that many of the folks contributing low ratings and comments about ""boring"" etc. are likely younger and/or less-experienced/less-open to seeing and reading minute facial looks, off-hand remarks, etc. If you are oblivious to such subtleties in Real Life or if you think that such relationship dynamics are themselves boring, you are not very likely to tune into them on screen and so much of this movie would be lost on you. (That's not a good or bad thing, it just means you and David O. Russell have different sensibilities about storytelling and movie-making.)

What this movie did for us -- besides being VERY entertained BOTH times we watched it -- ""American Hustle"" put David O. Russell on our short list of working Hollywood directors who make GREAT movies which puts him in the company of such talents as the inimitable Coen Brothers.

6091882,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle takes its time in every way. The story evolves slowly, but is worth a watch because the acting and set up are actually quite good. There's a combination love triangle and political fraud going on, as well as countless subplots that are all woven together in a labyrinth of deceit that ultimately takes a toll on everyone, especially the desperate characters. The trouble is, the director and writer tried to do too much. It would have been better as a simple scam plot which would have given enough room for this fantastic cast to show their stuff. As it ended up it was too much of everything. And yet, I couldn't turn it off because it was a flashback to that era when disco was still popular and hustling was the name of the game.

Emotional things are going on, but it is filmed and acted in such a way that all that is being conveyed is I'm an important actor in a movie with Robert DeNiro and I'm in an over the top 80s get up.  It is also one of those lazy movies for lazy people so that every sense leaves nothing to the imagination and just in case you fell asleep, every little thing is wrapped up in a bow with a voiceover at the end.  It is supposed to be 1978, yet it makes the Hollywood mistake of making literally everything in the film from March 3 of 1978.  Every car, every tchotchke, every hair style is shining and over aestheticized, as if nothing in 78 existed until 78.

6091989,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustled out of good money by misleading Ads.  The ads for this movie made you think it was a rollicking fun adventure about  the FBI and con men/women bringing down crime.  What you get is a 'poor me' hard drama that portrays the FBI as bumbling fools out to get 'poor misunderstood entrapped politicians' who just wanted to help their communities and not line their own dirty pockets, not to mention sympathetic, noble mafia who are never portrayed as scary (just believed to be, and of course, immediately understand that the hustler is going to help them escape the FBI), victims that are portrayed as 'suckers that deserve to have their life savings and hope destroyed', and so on.
Add to that, reality TV like camera work; mumbling script; poor me tirades; and ads that used a line and scene that wasn't even in the film (and helped portray it as a 'fun' movie) and you can understand why I feel so ripped off.  I forced myself to keep watching hoping it would get better, waiting for the 'fun' to kick in that the ads had promised me....they never came, and I'll never trust these directors again.

6091997,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Another 2013 film dealing with another edgy subject, the con game, with a wonderful cast doing excellent work.  Bale is a master at burying himself in his character.  The personable con man who is strangely normal in many respects, a married man with a child he loves, working at odds with the law, picking up a brilliant partner, a girlfriend who is perhaps even better at the game than he is.  He is drawn into a sting operation by a cop who is full of himself and intending to put paid to the game and become the most important man in the force.

The game involves nave and savvy politicos, some of whom are taken in by the game and the other, the Mafia cleaner, who is not.  The bad guys, Bale's character and his girlfriend, are the true savvy players who try to bring the game to a satisfactory end, for whom?  Themselves, the mob, the cops, the politicos?  Twists and turns and an insight into the game that is interesting in itself.",1397865600,4,940,4.367816091954023

6092045,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"Having spent my '20s in the '70s, I expected a more accurate portrayal of the period.  Instead, it is all a bit jumbled, there are glaring errors, and the fashions look like they were taken from movies of the '70s, not from the actual clothing people wore.

Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams deserve their awards for their performances.  Christian Bale does well as the grafter.  But Bradley Cooper is, well, Bradley Cooper.  He's playing the usual character, varying only for whether he's playing someone who's sniveling, or someone who is bullying.  Here he plays both.

The representation of the FBI is not consistent with actual FBI culture, but at least it avoids the usual fawning image of the FBI as clockwork, cookie cutter agents who are either good or bad according to the script.  In this case, they are all sniveling, bumbling, and clueless.

And in fact this is what I don't care for in the movie.  Not a single character has any redeeming feature that would make you care what happens to them.  Amy Adams, a personal favorite, acts well - but has nothing to work with.  Her character lacks qualities that call for sympathy.  And she's the best of the lot.  The rest, you just want to see something bad happen to, but there isn't anyone in the movie that you want to see succeed in doing it to them.

For all its praise, this movie left me cold.  I made it through to the end, but it will go in the ""donate"" box, rather on the ""watch again"" shelf.",1397779200,,1458,4.50763358778626

6092109,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"For all that we revere the farmer, the soldier, the statesman, the law enforcer, the clergyman and the hero, we Americans have always reserved a special place in our hearts for the outlaw, the gangster, the card shark, the con man, the hustler. Its a trait that goes to the very core of our identity as a people, a crucial element in our national mythology. From our most humble beginnings, hustling has stood as a time-honored tradition, a value as American as apple pie. Indeed, whole genres of literature and popular entertainment have sprung up around this idea. And for all the lip service we pay to what we righteously call the Protestant work ethic, we cant help but subversively admire those who are able to achieve the American Dream through less noble and less arduous means. Indeed, our history is populated with scoundrels and scalawags weve somehow managed to turn into folk heroes, and, while today our grifters operate on Wall Street or in corporate boardrooms rather than on the western frontier, the characteristics are the same: they're all just slick-talking manipulators operating outside the system and making a fortune while doing so. And, oh, how we love it! Unless its being done to us, of course; then, were not so crazy about it, which is why when it involves political corruption, the fleecing of us the taxpayer, we may no longer be quite so forthcoming in our admiration.

American Hustle is David O. Russells smart and savvy tribute to the con artist in all of us. He and his co-writer, Eric Warren Singer, have chosen to set their work in the 1970s, an age of polyester suits, ultra-wide lapels and bad comb-overs. It was also host to one of the biggest financial scandals of the modern era, Abscam, an FBI sting operation that resulted in the convictions of a mayor (played by Jeremy Renner), a United States Senator, six United States congressmen and an assortment of state officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania on bribery and corruption charges. American Hustle starts off by declaring that SOME of this actually happened, and, indeed, the movies often absurdly comic, larger-than-life quality makes us question the veracity of a good deal of what were seeing. But no matter because the movie is clearly more a study in character and theme than it is a factual recounting of the events of history (which explains why all the names have been changed to protect the guilty).

And what a cast of characters Russell has gathered for our amusement and delectation! A paunchy, balding Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld, a natural-born shyster whos found a way to earn money (to the tune of $5,000 a crack) through offering loans to people desperate for cash, money these down-on-their-luck individuals will never see. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), a scatterbrained chatterbox who is so high maintenance that Irving is forced to live on his own even though he supports her and her son, whom hes adopted as his own. Irvings problem is that for all his willingness to rip off people, he may be just a tad too softhearted to be very lucrative at his profession. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an attractive woman with some secrets of her own who becomes Irvings business partner and lover.  Theyre not in the business very long before undercover FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) blows the lid off their operation, offering them immunity from prosecution if theyll help take down some bigger fish. Richie is, in many ways, the focal point of the screenplay, a preening, overreaching lawman whose main concern is netting as many big fish in his net as he can in order to make a name for himself. Its not long before tensions are developing among the three principal players, and much of the movies fun derives from watching these two outsized figures, who find their value in being able to manipulate others to their own advantage, engaging in what amounts to a giant pi**ing contest over strategies, ethics and even Sydney herself.

As with any good tale of con artists and grifters, American Hustle beguiles us with the spectacle of hustlers hustling the hustlers, since, as were told, hustlers are ultimately just people doing what they need to do to survive. It gets to the point that not only do the characters not know whos telling the truth and whos playing whom, the audience cant tell either. And even though Richie thinks hes shrewd enough to play in the big leagues, he soon learns the bitter lesson that, when it comes to hustling, amateurs should never mess around with professionals.

Russell employs a dizzying whirlwind technique - consisting of fast-paced storytelling, energetic camerawork and editing, snappy dialogue, crisp narration - that puts one in mind of Goodfellas. Even when the action is set in an enclosed room, which is often the case, the movie never stops moving. Its alive and were alive to it. Moreover, the spot-on period details, especially the uber-tacky 70s fashions, only serve to heighten the absurd humor of the tale were watching.

American Hustle boasts one of the finest acing ensembles weve come across in quite some time, which, in addition to the main cast, includes Louie CK, Michael Pena and Robert De Niro, among others.

Theres a manic energy in both the performances and the filmmaking in American Hustle that perfectly reflects the soul of a nation founded on youthful vigor and anti-establishment rule-breaking. And indeed its that uniquely American spirit of anarchic iconoclasm that Russell captures to such memorable effect in American Hustle.",1397692800,,5563,4.930629669156883

There are no dull moments from start to finish. Calling it hard to follow is a bit more understandable (I guess), but there is hardly any mystery in this movie! It is laid out neatly, but I noticed a trend while reading the one-star reviews: Most of the people who strongly disliked this movie lack the ability to pay attention or follow a story.

People don't like the film because it doesn't get to the point, as if life is just about our birth, highest achievement, and then death. The movie elegantly explores the moments in between and the relationships between real characters and subtly builds the main character and keeps you interested in the many dynamics of the films themes while leaving you in the tantalizing dark about the plot - brilliant. There are many moral themes playing out in which establishment ethics and street code battle out to wits end and in the end the good guy wins; which is really just a cherry on top of a classic tasteful American Sunday. Each character is perfected and their growth through the film is therapeutically cathartic.

Furthermore, I was impressed by the players.  They did a great job.  But I am always most impressed by Jenifer Lawrence.

I know this film has been critically acclaimed and was a big box office success; and it has received some awards recognition. The performances, especially by Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, are masterful; and Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper's performances are commendable too. But I was so disappointed in the degree of fictionalization of the ABSCAM Scandal - a story with I believe is worth telling - that I could not bring myself to to give it the highest rating. For example, the Camden, NJ mayor (played by Jeremy Renner) is portrayed as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam only to provide jobs for his constituents. In reality, though Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti was widely praised for caring about the people of Camden, he also had a reputation for corruption. During the real ABSCAM operation, he offered to get the fake sheik into illegal businesses such as money counterfeiting and drug smuggling. That is just one glaring example...there are many others. I was also turned off by the gratuitous profanity, nudity and sex...which made the film difficult to watch at times.

But his girlfriend thinks she's up to the challenge, and even the FBI guy is hustling to make the arrest that will really advance his career.  Very cleverly written and well acted.

It is INCREDIBLY slow and Waaaaaaaaay too loooooong - It could have been done in half the time. According to the opening, some of it is true.

As for the story, it was only just okay for me. I wasn't sure what to expect going into except that the move won a bunch of awards. Unsure what exactly was so spectacular about it but it is definitely rent-able if you have nothing else going on.",1397088000,,501,4.112244897959184

From tense moments to passionate exchanges, the best feature to American Hustle are the people who's lives it follows (and almost ultimately destroys).  No crazy action or gratuitous sex here, but a riveting story none the less, and as long as you're not mindless you'll have a great time watching it.  Especially when you're trying to figure it all out for yourself when it's all over.

The Good:
Gripping performances that evoke real emotion
Incredible soundtrack
Written in a way that will keep you glued (mostly) the entire time

The marketing for this movie was excellent. The previews looked great, but the actual movie was disappointingly flat. The backstory was good, then the rest of the movie falls flat remaining unengaging and slow until the predictable ending where the story comes together.

Glad I didn't waste good movie popcorn by seeing it at the theater.  When you get a bunch of hollywood 'stars' sitting around with nothing to do but sell their names, this is the silly excuse for entertainment they produce.  Probably win a million academy awards ... which is hollywood swelled heads patting themselves on the back for being so great.

In fact, the buzz surrounding this production is overrated.  To this viewer, it's the kind of movie where you might a well sit back and simply enjoy the acting and not really worry about, ""Fully grasping what's going on and what the hell just happened"".

I would like to have seen more range in their line delivery.  In my opinion, the male characters were more talented and interesting.  The subject matter is disturbing to me, but I wanted to see the movie because it is based on real events.  When I read about Abscam after I saw the movie, I was impressed with how much Bale's character looked like the real person his character was based on.  I didn't like the camera work.

The magic is in the small details, the dialogue(with great Brooklyn/Jersey accents), the character flaws. and the ability to turn a serious moment into a comedic one. The settings, costumes, make-up and music help you see the 70's.

There was some good acting and some over acting.  If you watch it with less expectation, probably would enjoy it more.  There is always that one costume oversight I see and hyper focus on it.  It wasn't until I rewatched the beginning that I found out it was the 80s not the 70s.  Amy Adam's hot hair rollers were from the 2000s.  It could not have been that difficult to find hot rollers from the 80s - I had mine until about a year ago.. and they still worked.  :)",1396828800,,595,4.0256410256410255

6092711,2,B00GMV8M2Y,High expectations and very disappointing. Not Ocsar worthy. Christian Bale did a good job but movie moved too slow. Would not reccommend it to anyone.,1396828800,,150,5.04
6092712,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"Hard to believe this was up for an academy award. This is what was once called a ""B"" movie. As a craft the acting in this movie is well below what you find in movies (or TV programs for that matter) coming from Great Britain at a significantly better price point. Acting is better than the writing but not that much better.

Great movie if you want to watch what would have constituted soft porn during the actual era of Abscam and if the producers was shooting for background eye-candy that doesn't require you pay close attention it is on target. Other than that the only reason to watch this movie is to say you did.",1396828800,,619,4.336206896551724
6092713,3,B00GMV8M2Y,Kind of worn out with the kind of people that are portrayed in movies today. I heard so much about it and it just wasn't 't there for me. It is watching adults who had problems as children and are acting out their frustrations. Fum,1396828800,,231,4.155555555555556
6092714,4,B00GMV8M2Y,Christian Bale's performance is enough of a reason to see this film. Mesmerizing.  But the rest of the cast pulls off a screenplay that could have been pretty flat since we already know what happened.,1396828800,,200,4.714285714285714

6092721,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"The script is smart, the film moves fast, the characters are hilarious and yet sympathetic and the music is good.  But best of all are the performances.  I never liked Christian Bale much but he is terrific here.  Amy Adams is not just another  glamorous movie star but is a terrific actress; I hope to see her grow and develop over the years; she may be the next Meryl Streep.  Jennifer Lawrence is a total delight; I loved her angry dusting scene to ""Live and Let Die.""  Bradley Cooper may be the weakest link but perhaps that was just his character.  I loved the guy who played the governor of New Jersey and it was a treat to see Robert DeNiro, handsome as always.  The 70's setting provided us with the costumes and big hair of the time, which are entertaining in themselves.

It's a good, two hours of entertainment.  Its serious but not too serious and there's plenty of laugh out loud comedy.  I was suprised by the number of negative reviews here.  I would have thought it would have something to please everyone;",1396742400,,1022,4.464864864864865

6092724,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"The star studded cast was the big draw for me.  While the acting was good, the plot and story were not as exciting as I was expecting.  Not a bad film, but not a must see either.  It was just OK.",1396742400,,195,3.707317073170732

6092726,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"The movie definitely has some great acting. Christian Bale is one of my new favorites - jennifer Lawrence is great , too They are all pretty good. The story - though based on a real story - is  a little tough to follow and didn't really catch my interest. There are way better stories told about sting operations etc. However, acting is great and I enjoyed the movie. Very funny as well....",1396742400,,390,4.416666666666667
6092747,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I saw this movie in the theatre and the pace was so rapid fire, I could not get all the lines. A friend and I wanted to watch it again, so I live streamed it on my television. It was as good as the first time around and I heard more of the lines. This is all ""Americana"". Symbolic of our making it big (money, work, love) or falling down (drugs, corruption, lost love), Generally a very enjoyable movie that I think will become a classic",1396742400,,437,4.093023255813954
6092748,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"After all of the hype & much expectation, I was really hoping this would land on my list of favorites.  Unfortunately it was slow and boring.  I rented it twice on my Kindle because I fell asleep the first time during the first 30 minutes.  SLOW!  I rented it a second time, thinking I'd give it just one more chance.... same thing.  I got through it, but only because I felt obligated at that point because I'd dropped almost $10 in rental fees.  Now I can see why it didn't get much attention at the Oscars.",1396742400,,509,4.25
6092749,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"From the opening, when Bale was gluing that disgusting rat's nest on his head, I couldn't stand the movie.  It never got better: The characters were uninteresting, there was little to no chemistry between them, the plot was convoluted to the point of inanity (yes, I know, it was based on true incidents), and the whole thing was just a hot mess. UPDATE:  I decided to read a complete recap of this terrible flick's plot, online, since I had dozed off so many times, during the movie.  In all honesty, the detailed plot summary simply proved how absurd this whole thing was.  Pass this movie by.  Yuck----",1396742400,2,605,4.616822429906542
6092750,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"The film was pretty average and only mildly entertaining. It would draw me in then pull me away with scenes of the cast bickering like crazed children. That got old. I like Cooper but he didn't really pull off the persona of an FBI agent to me, he was too loose. I thought at any time he would say he's a fake and con man himself. I was hoping for a finale with some visual pop to it but instead everything is explained in an office to wrap things up.",1396742400,,451,4.022222222222222

I thought the writing had it's unique moments, and what was cliche at least was done well. Bale was fantastic. Fat and disgusting, but damn good in this film.",1396656000,,685,4.716666666666667

Then you've got the four-cornered love triangle simultaneously playing out. The characters' lives hang in the balance while they deal with lust and jealousy, and you're never quite sure who's playing who. This film would not have worked without superb acting, and everyone in the film was superb. Christian Bale delivers his finest performance. Amy Adams is elegantly subtle. Bradley Cooper is hilarious. But Jennifer Lawrence steals the show as the incredibly gorgeous yet slightly insane disgruntled wife. Louis CK and Robert De Niro are fantastic in supporting roles.

Beyond that, the story line and the plot are absolute manic and enjoyable with a few nice twists here and there.  A little bit of ""who-dun-it"" and ""what's happening"" at the end and along the way.

Hilarious but far from silly.  There is something so endearing about Irving,  the quintessential warrior of his era.  His attention to his image is no less frivolous than a knight donning his armor. His love of his ladies fair, his battle with fate, his capitulation to treachery and the toll it takes on him evokes every bit of nobility as an arthurian saga.  He is humble.  He is kingly.  I was put off by the title...being sick to death of Hollywood sting plots.  Glad I overcame my bias.  Loved these characters.  Like Rick and Ilsa, Scarlett and Rhett, Irving and Sydney are symbolic of a generation.",1396569600,,782,4.753731343283582

6092921,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"***Spoilers Ahead***

Along with Wolf of Wall Street, this movie got such a great deal of hype, not to mention Oscar awards, that I figured I'd give it a shot. Just like with Wolf of Wall Street, I was quite disappointed by it. The story itself seemed to just jump around all over the place, flashing from scene to scene before the first one was finished. The characters as well seemed very uneven as well, making emotional leaps and nosedives all over the place without any real clear reason why.

You have our two ""leads"", Christina Bale (who I can't take seriously anymore after Batman) and Amy Adams, that are very close one second, then hate each other the next, then are back in close again without any real explanations as to why. They are supposed to be very smart con artists, and yet they don't utilize any of their skills to get out of the jam, or even try to, until the absolute last five minutes of the movie. Not to mention their ""chemistry"" seemed more like distilled water as opposed to any kind of fiery heat. I honestly couldn't care less if they ended up with each other or not by the end of the movie. And as far as the ""friendship"" between Bale's character and Renner's character, I only have Bale's voice over to tell me about this, because other than when Renner's character discovers what Bale's really been doing do we see any real emotion regarding the relationship between these two. Oh yes, and we have the film opening things with a shot of Amy Adams' character being a stripper, something that is never even mentioned again. So my question is, why even bother telling the audience about it? It brought absolutely no weight to the movie and quite honestly I forgot about that tidbit about the character five minutes later. The same could be said about Bale's character. The movie opens with him talking about how he shattered windows so his father would get business for his glass company so he wouldn't get ""taken"" anymore. Exactly how was his father taken? It's never even explained. Was it done legally or illegally? And, of course, there's his dry cleaning business, which is essentially pointless to this movie other than being a set piece in the beginning for Amy Adams to have a fashion show. Even Bale's art scam was pointless, as it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Hell, the scam he and Adams come up with made absolutely no sense. It was never really explained. What exactly were their marks giving them $5,000 for to begin with. Was it an investment, was it supposed to be money laundering? We're never told.

You have the FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who is so obsessed with going higher and higher up the criminal food chain that the entire character becomes a cartoon. When he beats the living hell out of his boss because he wouldn't give him an incredibly expensive hotel room for a sting operation, and is then given accolades by his boss's boss instead of being thrown out of the Bureau and charged with battery, at that point the whole movie had jumped the shark. And that's not even talking about his inexplicable use of cocaine in one scene that is never even hinted at again, regardless of his manic behavior throughout the movie.

Jeremy Renner did do a fine job in the role he was cast. The character seemed rather sincere and wasn't a typical dirty politician, which was just fine for this movie. I can't say I have any complaints about the character other than it and the actor were wasted on this film.

Jennifer Lawrence was fine, I suppose, though instead of being conniving and sneaky in her own loud way, she seemed like she was either a sociopath or someone with bi-polar disorder. Seriously, I doubt you'd have much trouble convincing a judge, even one from the late 70's, that she was in no condition to take full-time custody of her child.

Then there were the accents. I was actually ok with Adams' British accent. It wasn't great but it wasn't too terrible either. The problem I had is she was supposed to be from New Mexico and yet she would inexplicably shift into a New Jersey or New York accent when not using her British one. This is after, in the opening scenes, we hear her normal accent which sounds Midwestern. It just makes no sense. That and Alessandro Nivola, Bradley Cooper's boss's boss sounded like he was trying to do a Christopher Walken impression the entire movie.

About the only thing this movie had going for it was wardrobe, and by that I mean having the two leading ladies (more Adams than Lawrence) wear outfits that showed off their curves to the utter maximum without being vulgar for the entire movie.

Overall, I just found the movie to be pretty bad and find it very disheartening that this and Wolf of Wall Street are what is considered wonderful, powerful movies these days. It seems that the people in Hollywood really know their audiences now and know they can cram any kind of garbage down our throats, as long as their PR people tell us it's the finest cut of filet. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, or if you have to watch it make sure you don't pay a dime to see it, it's a waste of your money.",1396396800,4,5116,4.523243243243243
6092922,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"The ending did not match the overall storyline.  There were better movies that deserved a nomination. The best part of the ending was pointing out that everyone, including the people of New Jersey, came out the losers.",1396396800,,218,4.891891891891892
6092923,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I didn't know anything about this movie before watching it.  For the first half hour, I found it tedious and even a bit boring.  I wasn't sure where the movie was going, or what to expect.  About a quarter of the way though, it dawned on me - this is a very dry, deadpan heist spoof with some great acting, and even better writing.

Once it clicked, I found the movie to be very funny, and I will probably watch it again, because I am sure I missed a lot.  There are a lot of sight gags which go by very quickly, but which mesh almost perfectly with the dialogue.  Some of the jokes are so subtle that I found myself laughing at things, and the questioning whether they were actually supposed to be jokes.  I think that is part of what makes the movie clever though - It is like a Wes Anderson comedy, but vastly more subtle and ""mature.""  One of the scenes in the movie takes a very serious dramatic exchange of dialogue, and overlays it with almost slapstick sight gags to leave the viewer very conflicted about whether to laugh or gasp.

The script is very well executed by all involved.  We already know Christian Bale can act, and we finally saw a glimpse of where Jennifer Lawrence is headed with her career.  Lawrence's role was written perfectly for her - cautious and minimalist, but poignant nonetheless.  Can she really act?  It certainly appears so, though I can't help but think that she was at times too reserved in some scenes.  This was a movie about big characters with big egos, and Lawrence's character seems to wobble between being bigger than everyone at times, and disappearing into the narrative at other times.  I am very excited to see what she does in the near future.

For all the praise for Lawrence, I thought Amy Adams really stole the show.  She was sexy, sophisticated, smart and really connected with the viewer.  Every line was on-point, and her ability to work massive amounts of context into a 5 word phrase worked perfectly with the deadpan humor.  She was the serious counterpoint to Lawrence's fanciful role - not quite the innocent ingenue, but not quite the diabolical con artist, or the ambitious federal agent.  She plays the foil between the two, and does so brilliantly.",1396396800,6,2215,4.545454545454546

The previews looked great and I thought well I definitely rent this one and enjoy my evening with my husband. Nope...It started off really slowly to the point where we were just like ok this is extremely boring is it ever going to get better. It did at the very end we felt like, where we finally got the plans and started enjoying it. Was way to long of a movie, it could have been condensed and I do not say that about a lot of movies. My husband has mixed emotions on whether he liked it or not, He said he would give it three stars because of the great cast but would not give anything higher because of the jumpy story line. This is a movie I would not watch again and so happy I did not buy it like I was originally going to do. I am not sure I would recommend this movie to anyone else except for them to make their own opinions because half the people I know love it and half hate it.",1396396800,,1026,3.9138755980861246

6092944,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"I swear that's all I could think of during this movie.  He's doing a Robert DeNiro impression.  Then when Robert DeNiro does a cameo later in the movie, that's really when it got weird.

I watched this one twice, I think mainly because it kind of lost me in the middle somewhere and I wanted to be sure I didn't miss anything.  The movie is good.  She said tentatively.  It is good, it's just kind of hard to stick with.  Both times I watched it, I got up and went to the kitchen to clean, so I'm not sure if it just lost me or what.

Two things that stick out most, forgive me on this, Amy Adams cleavage....ha ha ha, AND Jennifer Lawrence's performance.  What was the deal with Amy Adams costumes?  Every outfit was cut to her navel.  I kept thinking something was going to fly out.  Now I was a kid in the 70s so I was around and I do not recall everyone wearing outfits with their boobs hanging out.  Very distracting although I guess that was for the guys.

Jennifer Lawrence, wow! She was simply amazing to me.  You know I thought of her as this Hunger Games, ""Potteresque"" kind of actress.  I saw her in the movie she won the Oscar for and I thought she was good.  I saw Hunger Games and wasn't impressed.  But she nails this character.  I felt like I've known people like that and I was just floored by that performance.  She is worth watching the film for, now she doesn't come in for a while, but wait for it.  So worth it.

This movie is supposed to be funny.  It is, kind of, but don't expect a lot of bellyaches from laughing.  Overall, it's worth the price for the video.  I remembered the Abscam debacle but didn't understand it at the time.  This helps get a better understanding of it.  It's probably too bad this movie didn't come out in the 80s when people would have remembered it.

I think the film tries to be a little Scorsese which is a compliment to him, but there's really only one Scorsese.  It's a good film with one really outstanding performance.",1396396800,2,1976,4.250673854447439

6093096,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Everything you look for in a movie--acting, music, plot and believable dialogue. Christian Bale was amazing--couldn't believe that was him at first. I give the casting director major kudos because the four main characters had such great chemistry together. I wouldn't call it a movie worthy of a Best Picture nomination, but this is what movies used to be like when I was growing up--Fun, witty and entertaining. I would defintely watch it again. For those who do not have the patience, of course, a movie like this will come across as boring compared to current movies that have to spoon-feed everything to the common audience member. American Hustle is a breath of fresh air and the 70s time frame added to its appeal.  Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams are both beautiful and talented and I will be following all their movies in the future. Bradley Cooper's acting chops were incredible (and humorous) too. People's personal tastes are all different, I know, but to call this movie boring is really missing the mark.",1396224000,,1017,4.878612716763006

6093118,2,B00GMV8M2Y,I can only think this movie was nominated for best picture  because it's hard to fill ten slots. The acting is nothing special except Jennifer Lawrence who was fun in this. The plot is so complicated I found myself trying to decipher it with someone else who didn't get it.

6093171,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"The hype around this movie, all it's award nominations and great cast, led me to believe it would be very special.

The acting was superb but I felt a little flat through most of it. Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Brad Cooper were outstanding but Jennifer Lawrence, wow, what a performance. And she's still so young. She's extraordinary playing Bale's conman wife.

I found the story meandered and I do wonder if it had been cut by twenty minutes or so the movie may have been that little bit tighter. I loved the 70s soundtrack and the nostalgia associated with the era (blokes with perms and all).

It's definitely worth watching simply for the marvellous acting.",1396137600,,664,4.706896551724138

6093176,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle was exciting from the word go. Christian Bale did a fabulous job as lead actor in this film. He carried the character with convincing accuracy.  Although Jennifer Lawrence did a fine job as ""wifey-poo"", she really tried to outshine Amy Adams.  Amy didn't have much of a chance in developing her character against the loud mouth of Jenifer Lawrence. Overall, the movie was great entertainment, with cameo a appearance from Robert Deniro as Mr. Tough-mafia-guy. Still, Bale outshined them all. Great movie.",1396137600,,520,5.178571428571429

6093189,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"I was not as impressed as I anticipated after all of its publicity.  Although I enjoyed the ""unreality"" of the 70's ""reality"", I enjoyed the play on our criminal justice institutions (FBI), the mob, and corrupt politicians; and even the unpredictable story twists or ""cons"" similar to the movie ""The Sting"".  However, the movie jumped around, was confusing, and aired on incredulous; and certainly was not worthy of the Academy Award notoriety.  I believe Hollywood has decided that throwing popular actors and cinematographers at any story will make a worthy movie.  Simply not true.  Mediocre yes, decent, maybe.  Not in the ballpark of top movies past.

Comparing American Hustle to the Sting is like comparing Robocop 2013 to Robocop 1984.",1396137600,,743,5.141666666666667

The story was somewhat lacking and hard to follow most of the time, but interesting overall. It was also VERY similar to Silver Linings Playbook generally speaking (I shouldn't be surprised since the director/cast were practically the same, though I was hoping for something a little different). With that said, all the actors did an extraordinary job. I thought the acting in this film was phenomenal and for that alone, it's worth seeing.

6093220,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"I really really wanted to like this.  But it is almost painful to watch- beginning with the opening scene and the ""hair"" arranging.  The details of the clothing, hair, talk, scenery - are distracting. Give me more meat and fewer table arrangements!  If you don't know the back story before you watch- you won't know and won't care after you watch.

Part of it may be the slew of semi-docudramas that populated the Oscar list and last year's movies.

No one is having fun in this movie.  If you need to watch schlocky old news, watch The Wolf of Wall Street.  At least those people are having fun and everyone's acting is superb!",1396137600,,628,4.504424778761062
6093221,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I was taken aback when ""American Hustle"" was awarded the Golden Globe for best comic picture.  If one finds greed, ambition, and corruption funny instead of tragic I guess you could call this film funny.  Personally I found it all a little ironic.  For those too young to remember events similar to what are depicted in this film  did happen.  If you find that incredible well this was the Carter Administration.  Director-writer David O. Russell expertly captures the sense of time of place from the attitudes, the music, and the fashions.  Stylistically the film is very reminiscent of Scorsese but Russell adds enough of his own flourishes to distinguish it from copycat status.  The ensemble cast assembled here is impeccable with standouts being Jeremy Renner as an entrapped New Jersey mayor and Jennifer Lawrence as a ditzy housewife.  I give Amy Adams' bad British accent the pass because her character is in fact an American stripper.  Robert De Niro has a scene-stealing cameo as a multilingual mobster.  The hair department should have gotten an Oscar for Christian Bale's hairpiece and Bradley Cooper's mini curlers.  The scene with Lawrence and the microwave oven is one for the ages.  I went into this film with heightened expectations and they were met but not surpassed.",1396137600,,1286,5.009433962264151
6093222,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"{3.5 stars}

AMERICAN HUSTLE is a whimsical social satire on greed and the amoral rat & mouse game of FBI/governmental entrapment, with a lot of insightful stuff about the world of appearances, selfish human agendas, and the phoniness in general behind them all. Set in the late 1970s, it captures (and ridicules) that era very well, especially with its use of 70s theme music for specific scenes.

While AMERICAN HUSTLE kept my attention throughout its two-plus-hour length, it may move a little too slowly for some tastes and could definitely use more hard tension. Much of the persistent humor is of the smirk-guffaw variety. There are also frequent attempts at lol-slapstick, but the exploding microwaves and one guy beating another over the head with a telephone just aren't particularly funny. This film would probably have worked better if it had just stuck to dry satirical humor, keeping the one hilarious exception of the impromptu after-the-big-bust party by the feds. Anyway, there are some twisty surprises here and there, not all of which are very believable, and it ties up a bit too easily at the end. Though AMERICAN HUSTLE works well as light but meaningful entertainment, the fact that it just doesn't go as far and deep as it could have keeps it from being the rip-roaring success it might have been. Better plotting, more suspense, and sharper surprise elements could have won that Oscar.

All the same, Christian Bale (as not-so-bad-a-guy con artist Irving Rosenfeld), Amy Adams (as Rosenfeld's indispensable cohort Sydney Prosser), and Bradley Cooper (as self-serving FBI agent Richie DiMaso) give some nice performances here, with special kudos going to Jeremy Renner as Mayor/FBI target Carmine Polito.",1396137600,2,1727,5.160714285714286

6093293,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I am outraged at the negativity toward a brilliant film. Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us?

American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.

Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.

Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at AH you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film and the use of narration replacing Gangsters and Mobsters with con artists but O'Russell takes the style and makes it his own. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pull you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the reasons the movie succeeds. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.

The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.

The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.

The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Elton John(Goodbye Yellow Brick Road),Wings(Live And Let Die),The Temptations(Papa Was A Rolling Stone),Duke Ellington(Jeep's Blues)and more. Outstanding soundtrack.

6093294,5,B00GMV8M2Y,I Want to watch it again for what I missed the first time. Actors deserved the recognition they got.great job!,1396051200,,110,4.55
6093295,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"So, the previews for this movie looked phenomenal and I was more than excited to watch it. An hour into the movie, I was fiddling my thumbs waiting for it to ""pop off"" with some kind of excitement. Well, apart from the outstanding performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, this movie was horrible in my opinion. Overall, the cast was wonderful but the story/plot was just idiotic and did not keep my interest at all. Basically, the plot is predictable and I saw the ending coming early on in the film. Also, I just found Christian Bale to be so disgusting to look at throughout the whole movie that I often zoned out whenever he spoke. Yes, I understand he gained all this weight for the role and had to wear a bad hair piece but geez his look was just so yucky. But hey, I see why he was nominated because he seemed to really embody this con artist character for sure. I also hated how you could see that the makeup artists or whatever did not do his ""baldness"" right. On both Christian and Robert DeNiro you could tell that it was fake!! What ticks me off is that the movie trailer and all the award nominations (and actual awards) for this movie made it appear as the greatest movie in years. And of course like an idiot, I purchased the Blu-ray without first seeing it...which I rarely do by the way...and now I am out of $25 for a silly movie that will just gather dust in my movie cabinet. I am also surprised that this film is directed by David O. Russell. Comparing his other great films to this one makes you wonder what happened. I give this 2 stars because the music was good and again for me Jennifer Lawrence is such a great actress -- I just instantly felt that the whole tone of the movie changed once she came onscreen. Anyway, save your money and wait for this to come on cable or better yet just never watch it. You won't be missing anything...trust me!!",1396051200,,1886,4.3456090651558075

6093380,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"This movie begins with the statement that 'The story is partially based on facts'. It is a fictionalized version of the Abscam case dating to 1980 in which the FBI and the rest of the Justice Department arrange a sting operation to trap a NJ senator and seven congressmen and other Jersey pols into accepting bribes to get a license for a gambling casino in Atlantic City. We are introduced to the con artists (Christian Bales & Amy Adams) assisting each other in selling fake art masterpieces to gullible citizens including the FBI (a separate sting) who have something on Adams and keep her in a bare room for three days in order to get her to get Bales to participate in the great sting. The FBI agent behind the sting, Bradley Cooper, is also a con man chasing Adams and conning his boss to get taxpayer money to set up the sting. An agent is dressed as an Arab prince who offers money through Bales to various pols starting with the Majority Leader of the NJ House, Jeremy Renner, who is portrayed as a 'good guy' only interested in supporting his community through casino-generated income, and, less clearly, Congressmen and Senators. But Renner takes money and serves his time in prison as did all the other pols.
But why was a two-bit con man able to carry out such a sting? The movie suggests that it was greed on the part of the pols. This was emphasized by a cameo scene with Robert DeNiro playing a Mafia don who was offered a bribe and spoke Arabic to the agent playing the Arab prince who didn't understand him and couldn't answer in his presumed native tongue. All the pols in this scene should have recognized the sting but didn't.
Two problems with the plot were the need to 'torture' Adams to get Bales to cooperate and the ending was somewhat unclear. The rumor was that the NYTimes was about to break the case, that someone had leaked information to the paper, and the sting had to be completed fast by getting an admission of bribe acceptance from a lawyer who represented whom? Nevertheless, the film ends with the principals living happily ever after and those stung paying their expected debt to society.",1395964800,2,2128,4.5732984293193715

6093384,5,B00GMV8M2Y,Fine acting!  Every actor really went outside the roles I've seen them play before.  The movie told an interesting story even if everything wasn't totally accurate.

His portrayal as a flabby, shrewd, snake-in-the -grass was a great breath of fresh air in juxtaposition with his usual alpha male, indomitable roles. And same goes for Jeremy Renner. All the characters, in my opinion, were very believable. DiNiro's brief appearance was, as usual, very, very impressive, very convincing-understated but powerful. Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence (I can't remember her last name, actually.) were flawless, as was the tall, curly headed guy who portrayed that over reaching, arrogant FBI guy.

Rarely does every character in a movie shine with a white hot light.  In this movie they do.  The females leads are simply incredible.  Amy Adams should have walked away with the Oscar.  While Blanchett's performance was notable, it was johnny-one-note.  Adams literally takes you on an emotional roller coaster with such intensity its frightening.  When Jennifer Lawrence is in a scene she is breath taking.  Bale and Cooper are outstanding, but in my opinion are just support for the women.  DeNiro will blow you away, as usual.

This was the filmmakers salute to all those well done mafia movies like Goodfellas, Godfather, etc.  The story was basically fiction.  The main male character was a slimebucket and drove his second wife to sucide and continues to bad mouth her.  His third wife/mistress grabbed a clue and left the swine.

Everyone else looked like they were playing dress up with their terrible 70s clothes and awful wigs (and way too much reliance on them for humor). I think if Amy Adams had an ounce of sex appeal the movie might have worked better for me. Worst casting ever. Just wanted her to cover up the whole time. Bradley Cooper must have sold his soul to the devil to get so many movie roles lately. Too bad he can't act. And the story? Muddled ... like a cheap knockoff of a much better Scorsese movie.

6093535,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"I just watched ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (TWOWS) -- a film that clocks in at just shy of three hours -- and then I watched ""American Hustle"" (AH) -- a film that clocks in at a little over two hours.  Guess which film seemed to have the longer running time to me?

TWOWS runs at an incredibly frenetic pace, mostly due to the standard terrific performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.  Sure, after watching that other film, you might look at your watch and think, ""Wow!  Where did the day go!"" but it is such a fun ride that you really don't care.  On the other hand, AH just seems to crawl along at a snail's pace, and after awhile I just wanted to roll up into a ball and go into my shell.

I will say that Christian Bale is fantastic, however.  When is he not?  I watched a bit of ""The Machinist"" the other night -- I've seen it in its entirety before, and I just wanted to see him in that film again to see if he was as good as I'd remembered -- and he might have even been better there, although it is a very close call.  He is such a versatile actor that he can move like a chameleon from one role to another and you might only recognize him after glancing at the credits.  The rest of the cast here is fine, of course, but it just seemed to me that this film is less than the sum of its parts; take each of the actors and he or she is very good to great, but add them together and something seems to be missing.

But to be fair, I will admit that I've never much been a fan of scam/caper flicks in general.  Usually, these types of films tend to believe that they are funnier than they are, and this one seems to follow suit.  I did get a chuckle or two here or there, but not as many as you'd think.

Well, if you are going to watch both AH and TWOWS, I'd recommend watching this one first.  Maybe I'd feel differently myself if I had.  I will round down from a 3.5 today on a minor disappointment for me.",1395878400,5,1905,4.0

For that matter, Jennifer Lawrence should have won Best Supporting Actress for her role in American Hustle.

Okay, what about the film?  Fresh.  Alive.  Different.  Challenging. Enjoyable.  FUNNY.  I can't say enough about it.  It's film-making at it's best.

David O. Russell is a genius director.  I have now watched it seven times.  Each viewing discloses new treats and touches and nuances.  Clever! Clever!  A crying shame that it did not win a single Academy Awards after its eight nominations.  It surely should have received the Oscar for best original screenplay.  Definitely best costuming.  Then I would have gone all the way and awarded it the Oscar for best film, Russell for best director, and Amy Adams for best actress.  Her performance is so layered and textured.  Her best work!  I have never been a fan of Christian Bale.  But on these multiple viewings, he is getting better and better in this role - very understated and brilliantly executed.  Even the soundtrack( a  strategic selection of 70's music) is a joy!  Maybe American audiences just don't remember (or appreciate) the disco era!!!",1395792000,,1028,4.816091954022989

6093642,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"Okay, as I figured, there are already 443 (!) reviews posted on Amazon for American Hustle.  The BD and DVD were released on March 18th. I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by Most Recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to my review of the DVD (non-Bluray) version. As I understand it the bonus features are the same on both the DVD and BD.

This 129-minute film is loosely based on the Abscam  sting in the 1970s  though there were never any women involved  (and here there are two) and, for those old enough to remember following the news then, the plot will be more interesting and somewhat easier to follow. I say somewhat because Writer/Director David O. Russell really plays with the real events a lot and often you cant tell who the bad guys (or bad gals) are and who arent.  In one of the special features  more on those in a minute  Russell admits that the plot is really secondary to the characters. He loves quirky characters and thats why he was attracted to the project.  Yes, they are quirky and the 70s clothes and hairstyles bring all the quirkiness out of all the lead actors. Now Amy Adams wears (should I say bare-ly wears?) her dresses that could be popular today. When the plot gets boring there is always Adams to look watch! This is unlike any character she has played before. Jennifer Lawrence is also playing a character unlike her prior roles and that makes it interesting too. But, honestly, I thought the film dragged a lot and that Russell created some scenes just so he could back them with 1970s pop hits.

Because there will be lots of opinions about the film  there already are  Ill now jump to the Bonus Features, and there really aren't many of them either. There are a group of deleted or extended scenes  (about 20 minutes worth) but two of them are just scenes of Jennifer Lawrence dancing around the house while pop hits like Shes A Lady play as a soundtrack. The now-requisite Making of featurette (about 16 minutes) features Russell, some of the cast and a few producers talking about how Russell is so great to work with and how challenging the roles were. And, of course, there are lots of clips from the film.

I enjoyed Russells Silver Linings Playbook, but American Hustle felt like it could have used a bit more editing, and a script that would help explain the whole Abscam thing to younger viewers.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6093667,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"The movie is good, but not Oscar worthy. The Sting is a much better movie with the same goals. Adams and Bale did their very best acting, which is not truly a complement as they fell short of being able to carry these roles to where they potentially could have gone. Jennefer Lawrence ,on the other hand , was a show stealer and showed she has Oscar level talent. Robert Deniro has a small role and he dominates the scenes like a great white amongst guppies. In fact, since this movie is all about the acting , watching the comparative acting skills is the real game in the movie. The movie itself sets up what is supposed to be a big con and then resolves it so magically, the actual plot is relegated to being irrelevent. Watch this for the acting, then rent The Sting to see how masters carry off what Hustle tried  to do.",1395792000,,825,4.288461538461538

I vaguely remember the Abscam sting operation from the late 70s, and the hideous clothes and hairdos and the smoking and the cocaine and general smarm that was the 70s.

The actors were perfectly cast, turning in stellar performances It would be hard for me to pick a favorite, although Christian Bale, for me, was a standout. He can really play anything. Bradley Cooper is proving he's the new guy to watch, after Silver Linings Playbook, and now this performance.
 Both Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence will have long careers. They have the goods. They may be future Meryl Streeps. I have to mention Louis C. K. He played his part perfectly.
 American Hustle moved at a frenetic pace, thus never leaving you feeling like it was too long or slow. It was one that left me thinking about it the next day. That is the ultimate sign of a great movie for me. I also have to mention how true to the era they were. It was very authentic.

Except for Amy Adams, the actors seemed as if they had never been in a movie before.  The movie was based loosely on the ABSCAM scandal and loosely is the correct word.  The plot wandered around and was hard to follow in this overly long movie.  The vulgar language certainly didn't add anything to the plot or enjoyment of the movie.  I have talked to a number of people who said they simply got up and left well before the ending.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one.",1395705600,3,653,4.347107438016529

6093696,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"AMERICAN HUSTLE is a movie which is only nominally about the Abscam sting operation in late 70's/early 80's. The real heart and soul of this movie lies in the many fictional characters created for it, who are all conning each other in one way or another. Basically, the movie is about what people do in order to survive. This is a very compelling theme which is suitably explored over the course of the film, but it lacks enough narrative focus to really leave an impression. Yes, it is wonderfully acted and has some funny scenes (as well as one tense scene with a great cameo), but David O. Russell let his actors run amok with the script and it shows. On the positive side, the film features some of the best period production design and costumes, as well as an impeccably chosen soundtrack. Tonally, Russell seemed to be going for a Scorsese feel. This was nice, but I would have rather that Russell put more of a personal stamp on the material like he did with his previous film SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. Still, despite being a gelatinous mess of a story, AMERICAN HUSTLE is a well-made, well-acted film but not much more.",1395705600,5,1126,4.579207920792079

Her kiss on Amy was perfect.  With Amy's acting and Jennifer's it should have won an Oscar. Jen's lip singing while cleaning cracked me up. Great movie in all.

The wardrobe and atmospherics were great.  The story line and acting and direction left a LOT to be desired.  Just WHAT was the point of view in this story-telling?

Utilizing Scorsese-like film techniques alone is not adequate.  Plus if any director needed Thelma Schoonmaker to edit down a film - this director surely did.  The story was meandering and Jennifer Lawrence was hammy and it was all so trite and pointless.

Watch a Scorsese film instead, even one you've seen before.... it's better time spent than watching this unfocused rip off.",1395705600,2,712,4.770491803278689

Blending truth with fantasy the film follows events in the life of two con artists who become insnared in an FBI sting and agree to use there skills to ensnare bigger fish in what would become known the ABSCAM operation that took place in the late 70's and early 80's.

Based on the Abscam scandals of the 70's, it features Christian Bale as a con man with a bad combover and an inflated ego. When he meets Amy Adams and her wardrobe of low, low cut dresses (her boobs ought to get a best supporting credit in this flick) it's love and larceny at first sight. Unfortunately Bale has a cray crazy Jennifer Lawrence at home, who blackmails him into staying in the marriage by using their son as a marker. Into the mess steps an ambitious but not too bright FBI agent, Bradley Cooper who entraps Bale and Anderson and forces them to scam corrupt politicans. And then things get really out of control. It's a good watch, keeps you engaged and guessing, and it has some terrific cameos. The writing is tense and moves well, but I thought it was just a smidge too long.

6093745,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle is an excellent ensemble of grade A actors who signed on to do a really bad film. Amy Adams plays a ghostly looking smoking hot babe in the first half of this film but fizzles out in the second half. Her makeup is poorly done. Adams is so pale white she truly looks sickly. I thought Amy Adams might seriously have Leukemia or was secretly playing the role of a mime. Someone forgot to tell Adams that in the 70s and 80s everyone had tans in the summer. Jennifer Lawrence best performance ended up on the cutting room floor. Quite frankly the whole film should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Lawrence is way too good an actress to accept such roles. Sorry but, this role makes Lawrence look cheap and she deserves better. Maybe the powers that be and a big pay day compelled Lawrence, as she is too brilliant an actress to do this film otherwise. Also noted is Lawrences hair which looks like it was styled by a low amp electrical socket. Insult to injury, apparently some producers thought they could recreate the magic of last years big winner, Silver Lining Playbook, by again teaming Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in American Hustle. Sorry folk, there is no magic in Coopers performance but the failure is the lousy script. However, those who love hair gone awry movies, get so see Adams and Cooper in hair rollers. Thank God, I can now check that off my bucket list. Christian Bale is way out of his normal element in this film and speaking of a bad hair day, Im hear to announce Bale wins the Oscar for worse hair ever in a motion picture. Rounding out the cast is Jeremy Renner and speaking of hair, every time I saw Renner in this movie, he reminded me of the Big Boy Restaurant iconic statue of the boy holding a hamburger. Renner had a small dull role that will be difficult to remember. Renner who? Looking at his performance in this movie, Renner has to be embarrassed to show his face, unless of course he has his hair on and is visiting Big Boys.

The Oscars are awards given by The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for exceptional achievement in the film industry. AMPAS currently has fewer than 6000 voting members. In 2014, the Academy announced American Hustle received 10 Oscar nominations. With this many nods for American Hustle, I have to ask if all AMPAS members are high. American Hustle is a poorly done, boring, nightmarish monster mash of hogwash created in Never Ever Land on the Island of Misfit Movies. There I said it, someone had to say it, and don't feel an ounce of guilt for saying it. The movie insults any known existence of real human life but on a positive note, it does come with a lot of bad hair!!! YEAH

The total gross box office take for this movie is in the millions and millions. The box office take tells me, American Hustle pulled the wool over the eyes of movie goers worldwide. Therefore, the biggest American Hustle here is the fact movie goes paid to see this very small minded entertainment. O dear, did I really call this movie entertainment? My bad! The long and short of this movie is, congratulations movie goers, you have been scammed by Bad Hair Are Us. Lastly, the Oscar for best trick without treat scam of the year goes to.  American Hustle. (Applause, Applause) All seriousness and joking aside, if you are looking to have a nice nap on a lazy Saturday afternoon, this is a great movie to sleep past, as long as you don't have to pay to watch it. Of course sleeping while watching this movie means you have to pay for the electricity, so maybe it is not worth watching after all.

6093749,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"The twists and turns of Christian Bale's sleazy conman character kept me engaged as he outwitted and outhustled Bradley Cooper's over the top, overly ambitious F.B.I. character. But the creepy love triangle between Bale's fat, sweaty, balding, comb-over conman character and Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence was completely unbelievable. Maybe because in real the real life version of Jennifer Lawrence's character was kinda homely looking and the mistress played by Amy Adams never existed. According to the original author that character was just made up to add some heat to the plot line, (sex sells).

All in all, the not so surprising twist that comes at the end where the bad guy wins and the good guy fails is fun.

Is she working with HIM? But I thought he was with that guy? Let's rewind. What??? Oh, I love her wrap dress!"" Maybe this was more of a character study as they say in the biz than a plot-driven piece.

Longer review for those not looking to argue but wondering if they should rent the movie or not:
10 nominations? Has the Academy really devolved to this point or am I just expecting too much? My wife and I made it through the movie but the whole time we kept asking...is this going to get any better? It may have the worst make up crew I've ever seen...I mean just take a look at Christian Bale in the opening scene where he is doing his comb over. Honestly, I thought his bald head was supposed to be a bad looking glued-on bald cap and it was going to be some kind of joke later...but nope, it was meant to be a real bald head. It looked like a clown cap...wrinkles in the forhead and all. It all went downhill from there for me. It looked like clips from other, better movies, spliced and sloppily glued together into an overly complicated, unrealistic mess.

Bad reviews are only posted by folks who fell asleep or couldn't follow the plot??? Really? I could see falling asleep but...C'mon...who couldn't follow this predictable movie. If this one sucks you in and amazes or surprises you...well, I just don't know what to say, except that you should have stopped reading at my short review.

Did I mention that the acting is pretty bad too? Not sure if it's the actors' fault as much as the director's, because Amy Adams has been good in other movies. If you watch it try not to pay attention to the acting. Some takes are way down there on the 'atheletes in movies' level. Even my wife noticed it and she never bashes movies.

6093828,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell is quickly emerging as the 'Next Scorsese' as American Hustle plays out very much like an homage to Marty and his masterpiece 'Goodfellas'. Russell is building a repertory company around Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Shea Whigham and Mr. Scorsese's former Ace (Rothstein), Robert DeNiro.  All four were able to recreate the manic energy that drove 'Silver Linings Playbook' in this period piece whose title includes a punning reference to the dance craze of the era it recreates.  While 'Goodfellas' was inspired by an earlier '70s 'crime of the century', the Lufthansa Airlines heist at JFK, 'Hustle' is about a similarly notorious latter '70s scandal, 'Abscam', that rocked politicians in New Jersey and Washington. Russell, like Scorsese and Sopranos' mastermind David Chase, is a prisoner of Rock 'n' Roll and his films unfurl like great Classic Rock albums, climaxing when the actors move and emote in time to epic recordings by legends ranging from ELO to Zeppelin, Steely Dan and Santana, all which serve to drive the narrative as effectively as his brilliant script.  Emerging male movie icons Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner (are imbued with the zany offbeat sexual charisma--bad hairpieces and all-- invented by DeNiro and Joe Pesci  in several of Scorsese's films) and Amy Adams hits all the high notes (drama, comedy, phony British accent and spot on sexy dancing) in a breakout performance as she shines so brightly that she affords the movie world's new Golden Girl Lawrence the opportunity to pick a few brilliant spots to apply her scene-stealing capabilities; via their fierce competitiveness for the affections of Bale, these two roar as the film's brassy feminine attractions. Add to all this a fantastic slapstick-inspired comic pairing of the consistently great Cooper with the suddenly (cinematic-ally) ubiquitous Louis C.K., as the Laurel and Hardy-like FBI agents who fall short of their goal to bust up the Mob's nationwide hold on gambling casinos (they have to settle for convictions of Congressmen and a U.S. Senator instead) and you have a film that you can't shake out of your system for at least a week after viewing it --at least twice if possible--much like a great Rock Concert.",1395705600,,2235,5.148760330578512

6093835,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"There was so much buzz about AMERICAN HUSTLE that I was curious to see it. What we have is a great cast of talented actors in a seriously depressing story about con artists, criminals and reasonably decent people being tricked into taking bribes. The movie is loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation that took down several political figures. AMERICAN HUSTLE seems to juggle the facts and create their own version of history.
The actors must have gotten into character.  Christian Bale gained weight for the film and has an awful comb-over bald balding hairstyle, lovely Amy Adams shows extreme cleavage and Bradley Cooper has the worst curled hair known in the 1970's. Jennifer Lawrence is also all hairdo and little substance. What does one make of this?
The characters are troubled and not likeable, except for one, and he pays the price for his decency.  Jeremy Renner plays Carmine Polito, the mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Here's another character with seriously strange hair--a mountain of hair piled on a little head. It must a theme in this film. He's the good guy of the film, the closest thing to a hero in this film. He loves his wife and children and is doing the best for his city, yet he is the victim of the scam. It is hard to watch a good guy innocently take the fall but again history tells a different story.
An Aran Sheik is needed to finance Polito's dream of bringing a casino to Camden. The FBI beings in a Mexican-American (Micahel Pena) to double as a Sheik. Hey, and add in an aged Robert DeNiro, again with really bad hair to be the mob kingpin. Does any of this even remotely make sense?
AMERICAN HUSTLE may have gotten a lot of praise but it can be a hard movie to watch. This great cast of actors are trapped in a dismal story about dismal people doing dismal things. The film is a waste of talent and is worth the watch only to know what other people have been talking about.",1395619200,,1907,4.492795389048991

6093848,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" justifiably almost took the Oscar for Best Picture.  It is very well acted and captures the vulgarity of the Abscam period with its enormous cars with ""opera windows,"" women's ""big hair,"" and ugly/tarty clothes.

Acting by the two female leads (Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence) is especially good.  Jennifer Lawrence has now shown that she can play much more complex roles than her Amazon/archer persona in the ""Hunger Games"" films.

My only criticisms are: (1) the movie is a little long - cutting about twenty minutes would have tightened it up, (2) it could have stayed closer to the facts in the Abscam case, and (3) the role of the FBI agent was a bit overdone.

DVD quality is fine, but I wish that the movie was not preceded by several trailers for other films that cannot be skipped.",1395532800,,809,4.709219858156028

6093851,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"In American Hustle, con man, Irving Rosenfeld (Bale), along with his seductive partner Sydney Prosser(Adams), is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Cooper), who pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia.

American Hustle is loosely based on events that happened in the 70's and that real story provides the backdrop for this entertaining story.

Christian Bale does an outstanding job at playing the aging and slightly overconfident and vain con man, Rosenfeld.  With the great makeup job combined with his being in character and playing the character very well, you hardly realize it is him.

This movie has a great supporting cast who do a great job in their roles as well.  Amy Adams also does a great job at being the seductive and fake British con artist who teams up with Rosenfeld as well.  And Bradley Cooper also does a great job at playing the slightly crazy and out of control FBI agent.  Also Jennifer Lawrence, as Rosenfeld's wife who seems to be Rosenfeld's kryptonite even though she is mostly nuts and erratic, does also a nice job at playing the role and playing it well.

This movie is a fun ride all the way through with its twists and turns and erratic behavior by all the main players who are all trying to con each other into doing their bidding throughout the movie.  This all provides a great cat and mouse type story that keeps you laughing and entertained all the way through, moments such as the fishing story are hilarious.

All in all this is a fun movie to watch, although a bit long, but entertaining all the way through.  Bale is great in his role and definitely deserved a nomination for his part.",1395532800,,1663,4.622448979591836

The movie was awkward, poorly paced, poorly edited, and made awful use of some great music.  My sense was that this an effort at a Coen brothers take on Scorsese; it did not work.

If you watch movies for pure entertainment without doing any mental work yourself  stay away from this movie or you will be lost in the dust within the first 30 minutes. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is an exceptional actor. His performance was impeccable. And the role of his wife in any other hands than Jennifer Lawrence could have made the entire movie fail if she was portrayed cartoonish.

6093873,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"They don't make them like this one anymore - excellent acting, excellent script, and plot to spare. Christian Bale is magnificent, as is Amy Adams. The soundtrack is exceptional for creating a sense of place and time. Hard to beat a movie like this, and I've turned off more than a few films I've paid for. When government is self-serving and crooks have good hearts (sometimes) it's hard to know who the good and bad guys are and you won't in this film either, but the end satisfies with a sense of fairness, despite a chaotic big con.",1395446400,,536,4.479591836734694

6093881,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"This was a rare movie for me to see, where I actually found all the key characters to be interesting!

Christian Bale stole the show with one of the most unusual characters he has ever played and doing so in such an understated, yet powerful way.

 Cooper and Renner both gave their best as well;with Renner gaining sympathy points for the well intentioned politician ,who falls in with the wrong kind of people in an effort to better his constituents lives.

Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams pretty much draw a tie in acting ability, with a slight edge  given to Lawrence, based on the fact that she proved her ability to come across as a woman older and more jaded than she is in her real life.

The plot line is different for sure, and will send many to GOOGLE after viewing, to learn how much of the story is real vs. fictional.

All around- I enjoyed watching this movie unfold and it had an ending to satisfy all. :-)",1395446400,,922,4.3882352941176475
6093882,1,B00GMV8M2Y,I liked all the actors in other performances but the story and the writing was bad and predictable...Bradley Cooper's role was probably the worst performance I've seen from him.  Did not deserve any awards...waste of my money.,1395446400,4,226,5.108108108108108
6093883,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"The female leads, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, were riveting in this movie showing tremendous tour de force performances with the most convincing portrayals of their respective characters.  The leading edge would be given to Ms. Lawrence who thoroughly conformed to the requirements of her role.  It never once entered my mind that I was watching the same actress from, say, the Hunger Games movie.  The illusion of her transformation was pure organic alchemy.  Unfortunately, I didn't always get that feeling about Ms. Adams, though I admire her screen presence enormously.  It must be something about her well-scrubbed, purely American image most reminiscent in the Night at the Museum role she played with great effectiveness, that caused me to ponder if she must compulsively rinse her mouth after each profanity uttered.  Ergo were the slight tings of self-embarrassment for me when her costumes were reduced to the minimum.  Not so with Ms. Lawrence.  She could make me believe anything.",1395446400,,997,5.226415094339623
6093884,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"This was one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life, but then I didn't like ""Fargo"" either which most people did. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, though it did not win any (I can see why).

If you want to see a bunch of Eastern Seaboard types yelling and screaming profanity, this is the film for you. The characters are flat, and I couldn't get myself to care about any of them.  I disliked this movie so after 30 minutes, that I switched to the movie ""Dave"" with Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver and found it was much better than ""American Hustle.""",1395446400,2,565,4.271028037383178
6093885,5,B00GMV8M2Y,This movie was a roller coaster ride from beginning to the twist at the end.  It was certainly NOT what I was expecting but let me say I was very surprised at how entertaining it was.  The acting was all superb but Christian Bale stole the show and should have gotten an award for his performance.,1395446400,,297,4.285714285714286
6093886,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I have to say that I was ready to blow off this movie because of the bad reviews but then I read some of the good ones and it prompted me to give it a chance.  When I first started watching it I was lost but then I was trying to watch it while doing something else.  This is not that kind of a movie and you do need to focus on it; once I did that, I liked it.  My husband did what others seem to be doing.  He walked out of the room and said it was weird while I ended up liking this movie a lot.

I also think that Amy Adams and most definitely Jennifer Lawrence were ROBBED of an Oscar.  Jennifer Lawrence was so fantastic in the movie that she dominated every scene she was in and you wanted her to be in more scenes.  Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper were really good in the movie too. Overall, the acting was really good and I can see why the actors and movie won a Golden Globe award; they should have won more.

Ive seen ""Blue Jasmine"" (slow moving, Cate was good but not enough to win), ""Gravity"" (boring, love Sandra Bullock but not in this movie) and ""12 Years a Slave"" (horrible movie and some of the worst acting, don't know how it won the awards it did) and I have to say in all honesty that Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence should have won.

I am giving this movie 4 stars (cant give it 4.5) and not 5 for one reason only, it does take focus and it can easily lose viewers and ratings because of it.  I actually liked the soundtrack but then I am almost 60 years old and I know this music.

The bottom line is, GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE or perhaps a 2nd chance and give it your undivided attention.  Only then will you begin to understand why we are giving it such a high rating.  I will be purchasing this movie but NOT ""Blue Jasmine"", ""Gravity"" and definitely NOT ""12 years a Slave"".",1395446400,,1799,4.033802816901408

There are some funny parts, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a comedy.  But, the movie was too long and could have been better with some scenes edited down and a better script. If you saw director Russell's great film, Silver Linings Playbook, or his solid, The Fighter, you may find this to be a disappointment.",1395446400,,475,4.654761904761905

6093895,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell made 2 consecutive fine films, ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Lining Paybook"".  This one is a misfire.
To start with, the filmmakers have a good concept: A playful and a bit over-the-top account of a group of con men and women who tried to rip off some unsuspecting victims in New York roughly based on real events and persons.  Russell assembled a top name cast with some loudly authentic costumes, hair pieces and art directions.  The film started unexceptionally and things began to fall apart when the mafia person played by Robert Di Nero and the actor who played the sheik appeared.  At times, the filmmakers and actors seemed having a better time than the viewers.  Christian Bale was a weak lead, probably the fault of the script.  Amy Adams was more flash than substance.  Only Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner gave more impressive performances.  It is long and does not get anywhere.  It is neither a comedy, drama or serio-comedy.  Not a good film, not to mention all the Academy Award nominations.",1395446400,4,1024,4.8

I can't wait to see this again, because now that I realize it's really all about the two of them, I think I'll enjoy it even more than I did in the theatre. I have to say, however, that though everyone is excellent, this is really Christian Bale's show. In many ways, it's such a subtle performance, and I don't think subtle performances ever get the credit they're due. He really carries the whole movie; it wouldn't be the same movie without him. He's not afraid to underplay the role, and let the character do the talking. He's not worried about coming across as ""likable"" or ""relatable"". He just plays the role as he thinks it's meant to be played. It's a very entertaining movie, that is well worth your time.",1395360000,,828,4.490066225165563

Without giving away any spoilers, the con artists always think several steps down the road while government agents can get fixated on the particular stage they are dealing with that day.

The design of the costumes and film reminds me of Steve Martin and Dan Akroyd - wild and crazy guys, Only there's nothing funny in this movie, nothing to care about at all. It's all about the low life with lots of histrionics but no real feeling. Bradley Cooper gets singled out as making his character as blatantly unappealing as possible, a comic book villain, overplaying lust to a ludicrous degree. They're all comic characters, comic book clothes, comic book sets.

6093939,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"While I do not necessarily think American Hustle will go down as one of the best movies ever, I do think it deserves the accolades it got for being one of the best of this year.  It is a fictionalized version of actual events, telling the story of two con artists in the late 1970s who get busted by the FBI and are forced to cooperate with them to take down politicians and mobsters.

The movie is all about the characters and the acting.  It is a story where there are really no ""good"" people.  Although all the characters do have some good qualities to them, they are all also very flawed.  So there is really not anyone you truly get behind and root for.  In fact, the closest to a ""hero"" in the story is Renner's character, Carmine Polito.  I do think all the actors did a wonderful job.  Everyone was really playing a role different than anything they had done in the past, but in my opinion Amy Adams really stole the show.  She was great in every scene she was in whether she was being a British seductress or when she was emotionally vulnerable.  Jennifer Lawrence also did a great job as the bi-polar wife of Christian Bale's character who inserts herself into the operation.  My only complaint is that at just over 2hrs and 10 min it went a little bit too long.  I think some could have been cut out to make the pacing a little bit better.

For those who get the actual discs, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  As far as extras go, there are about 22 min of deleted and extended scenes, including two versions of Jennifer Lawrence's power cleaning scenes where she lip syncs to ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Evil Ways.""  There is also a short ""making of"" documentary with interviews with the cast and director.  Not extremely extensive, but good for what is there if you like going through that material.",1395273600,,1821,4.375

6093944,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell and his entire crew created one of the most impressive films of last year. Strange it was so highly honored by everybody but the Oscars. If ever there were a candidate for Best Ensemble Cast AMERICAN HUSTLE wins hands down. Loosely based on the Abscam, which for those who have forgotten, 'Abscam--sometimes written ABSCAM--was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors. The investigation ultimately led to the conviction of a United States Senator, six members of the United States House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.' Given that bit of reality, Russell and cast and crew created a stingingly brittle yet funny movie.

AMERICAN HUSTLE is set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation. It tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Elisabeth R&ouml;hm is Carmine tacky wife, Louis C. K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Michael Pe&ntilde;a is the Mexican man pulled in to impersonate Sheik Abduklah, Alessandro Nivola is the smarmy Anthony Amado, and Jack Huston is the guy Rosalyn goes after - Pete Musane.

The costumes, hair, clothes, music and sets mirror the tacky 70s and make us all remember how over the top we were. But setting the core of reality for this fictional movie aside, here are some of the finest acting performances on film to savour. March 14",1395187200,,2445,5.171717171717172

6093955,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"This is one of the best films of 2013, the film had sort of a goodfellas feel to it, it was like the goodfellas, a crime drama, but with a spice of comedy that will have you rolling and begging for more.  The plot begins with Christian Bale and Amy Adam's characters getting in trouble with the FBI, they were con artists and conned the wrong person; Bradley Cooper's character. Bradley's character cuts them both some slack and has them become informants for the FBI to catch bigger fish, being a 1970's italian mafia movie, there's a lot of big fish to fry. Anyways, without giving too much away, there's a love triangle between the the four character's, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, and the lovely Jennifer Lawrence. AMAZING acting, funny, yet heart breaking drama comedy, this film deserved the nominations it got.. it's truly an instant classic, falls into the classics like Forest Gump, Goodfellas, it's truly an amazing picture that I wouldnt mind seeing again. Jennifer Lawrence played a guidette, poor, single mother that didn't have Christian Bale's character too much in her life, because he was too busy conning people with his partner in crime Amy Adam's... Jennifer Lawrence is loveable, funny, and will bring a tear to your eye... originally she is what brought me to see this movie. Anyways, it was kind of slow in the beginning, getting to know the characters, but man does it pick up, and man what a ride! Must watch! You won't be sorry.",1395100800,,1469,4.76078431372549
6093956,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"The first time I saw ""American Hustle,"" I didn't. I fell asleep. By what the critics were proclaiming, not only did I miss ""the best film of the year,"" I also slept through it. I had committed a crime against cinema- and as an avid movie-goer, I even felt like I disrespected the art form. Church is what it felt like I'd fallen asleep through, and religious heathens were the ones I felt as if I'd disappointed.

So, in an effort of redemption, I took off to the movie theater that following weekend, highly caffeinated, and more than ready to experience the movie of 2013. I did not fall asleep this time. For two hours and ten minutes I watched... wondering... why my eyes were still open this second time around. ""American Hustle,"" as it turned out, is a film coasting on the popularity of those involved.

The narrative fails to engross and relies completely upon its actors to get the audience through it all. In doing that, the acting is almost always distractingly scenery-chewing. Jennifer Lawrence hams it up in a part meant for someone older; Christian Bale's make up is thicker than his Jersey accent, and everyone else is just deflecting. Louis C.K. is the only one who steals the show simply because it's with very little effort.

David O. Russell, creator of some of my favorites (""Flirting With Disaster,"" ""Silver Linings Playbook""), is the manufacturer of only a decent product here. ""American Hustle"" is never bad. There are moments that hold interest, but many more that don't. More importantly, there's a showing off-ness permeating throughout the picture that can never be shaken and a glorified reputation that it never amounts to.

In a way, ""American Hustle"" feels like this monster that climbed the Empire State Building to declare its height, but falls to its death in the process. No, it wasn't the air planes that got him. It was hype killed the beast.

6093957,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Have we been hustled by this film? At times I thought so, a little slow going at first, but then it interrupted into a fast paced film that brought excitement. The film was fashioned after the Abscam affair in the late 80's.

""Abscam--sometimes written ABSCAM--was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office[1] in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors.

Wiki

Now we see how this entire affair went down, and what we have is a film with superb characters and acting. Christian Bale is the epitome of the com man, and with his intelligence, Amy Adams, good looks and brain, we have one heck of a scam. The FBI enters with Bradley Cooper as the leader of a group,looking for a couple of good arrests for a fame hungry leader. Jennifer Lawerence as Bale's wife knocks the ball out of the park with her role. Jeremy Renner as the mayor of a New Jersey city, always on the make for his city brings truth and life to his role. Every one in this film out did themselves, believable and so ironic. Can a con man con those in the law? Robert DeNiro plays the second in command of a Florida branch of the Mafia. The hair,and I am not talking about Amy Adams, is so awesome. The clothes of the time, the cars, the homes all a remembrance of things past.

This film was one of the better of the season. If not for 12 Years A Slave,this film would have found the Oscar. Kudos to all.

6093958,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Imagine a con-artist couple, Irving and Sydney.  They get busted by an FBI agent, Richie, who asks them to help him nab a mayor and a bunch of crooked politicians.  The scheme involves a fake sheik, thousands of dollars that no one wants to put up, the mafia, and Irving's unpredictable, manic-depressive wife Rosalyn.

Sound like a slapstick comedy by way of Martin Scorsese?  It is, sort of.  David O. Russell's AMERICAN HUSTLE is an homage to a decade, and an attempt to hone in on some of the classic Scorsese vibe.  A bit too much, at times--the style seems a bit of a rip-off at times, especially when paired with the (admittedly great) soundtrack.  In fact, as good a director as Russell can be, this film is elevated by its script (courtesy of Russell and Eric Warren Singer, featuring fantastic dialogue, some true emotional grit, and a couple nice twists) and the acting.  Christian Bales gives a complex, nuanced performance, which slowly grows as we learn more about Irving.  Amy Adams is dynamite; Bradley Cooper makes his jerk FBI agent sympathetic (but not so much that we ever truly like hime); Jeremy Renner doesn't get a whole lot to do as a pawn in the scheme, but he's clearly having fun.  Aside from Bale, it's Jennifer Lawrence who steals the scenes; like Bale's, her performance grows in complexity as the film progresses.  Sure, she's playing an older character; but it was only when a friend brought it up that I realized she's just 3 days shy of being exactly 4 years younger than me.  Like Bale, who becomes a pot-bellied, balding schlub with a combover, she nailed it.

Kudos also goes to a cameo appearance from a film legend that I won't ruin, because it was a genuine (and pleasant) surprise for me.

AMERICAN HUSTLE is one of those films that screams, ""Give me an Oscar!""  Perhaps David O. Russell is a little desperate at this point.  That being said, it truly is an enjoyable film, at parts funny, at parts dramatic.  It leans a bit on Scorsese's filmography (particularly GOODFELLAS), but the acting is top-notch, the script is solid, and the overall experience has a few nice thrills.  Maybe it's not worthy of 10 Oscar nominations (and no wins, another Scorsese comparison you can make), but it's certainly one of the better movie experiences out there.",1395100800,,2290,4.711055276381909

6093963,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I kind of love that this movie opens with the clever disclaimer Some of this actually happened because it sets a tone that pays off, mostly, for this energetic and enjoyable romp from David O. Russell.  Russell is a director who has been getting a lot of flak over the past few years (and his past few films) for selling out; leaving his former eccentric formula of filmmaking for a more commercial and Oscary trajectory.  I honestly didn't care too much either way.  The only Russell film that I really like is I Heart Huckabees, which is actually very different from any of his other films Ive seen.  Granted, I haven't seen Flirting With Disaster (which I hear is a favorite among his fans) but I seem to find some kernel of something I dislike about all his films, sans I Heart Huckabees.

Still, I was kind of excited about American Hustle.  Ill admit, when the project was first announced I wasn't very interested.  I liked some of the cast and was disinterested in the other half.  Bale and Adams are usually reliable presences, and while I was never a fan BEFORE Silver Linings Playbook, I became a fan of Jennifer Lawrence based on that spirited performance and her tactless charm.  Still, I kind of hate Jeremy Renner and find Bradley Cooper annoying.

But then the trailer was dropped and it looked like such fun!

For me, American Hustle kind of feels like an eccentrically commercial film, so maybe this is the perfect lane for Russell, who obviously wants that Oscar.  Im still shocked that this so heavily over-performed with Oscar (racking up TEN Oscar nominations) and yet failed to win a single award, but AMPAS is obviously responding well to Russells directorial direction, so Im sure its only a matter of time.

Like I said; I couldn't honestly care less, but whatever.

The film is loosely based the ABSCAM federal con-job of the 70s.  Im not entirely familiar with the real story, so I have no idea what of this actually happened, but this was intricately plotted fun, and while there are some plotting issues, this film mostly succeeds because of an ample cast and some sharp direction.  Yes, David O. Russell has some serious fun with this one; point to point.

Here we have Irving Rosenfeld, a charismatic con man who gets himself in a sticky situation when he gets busted by an over ambitious FBI agent named Richie DiMaso.  Irvings partner, Sydney, is pulled into Richies web of charm and while Richies grip on Irving and Sydney tightens with his proposition to them, she begins playing the field herself; turning tables with a subtle allure.  You see, Richie wants bigger names than Irving Rosenfeld, and so he offers Irving a clean slate if he helps entrap four big names.  He sets his sights on Carmine Polito; an ambitious New Jersey mayor looking to make a better life for the kids in his community.  With his passions and Irvings persistence, the con is in place to make Richie a big name in his unit.

But Irvings crazy wife, Rosalyn, could ruin everything.

The energy here is pretty great, and that is thanks to all the sharp editing tricks.  Some films really rely on those cuts to create the needed tone, and this one has that in spades.  I kind of found the dialog here really pedestrian, so while the whole plot unraveling and twists here and there were intriguing and wholly engaged, the dialog in some key scenes was just distracting.  Thankfully, actors like Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper knew how to take those ridiculous lines and make them feel soulful and spirited.  The cast all works really, and I was surprised with how much I really liked Jeremy Renner here (who was honestly best in show).  A lot of people balked at Lawrences high octane performance and her battle with the accent, but she was just so hilariously layered here.  Her confrontation scene with Adams, despite some shoddy dialog (seriously Russell?) was so human.  Adams accent work, although part of the film itself, was more distracting simply because it was so unbelievably uneven that I cant imagine anyone would fall for it, let along an FBI Agent.

But like I said, this was a lot of fun, and while I would have trimmed this down a tad, I cant say that I want my time back.",1395100800,,4203,4.646820027063599

6093982,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell's ""American Hustle"" tells a mostly fictionalized account ('some of this is true' a title says) of the 1980's 'Abscam' scandal in which an eccentric FBI agent exposed corruption in political figures in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  That just begins to describe this top-notch entertainment with idiosyncratic characters that fascinate as they make you laugh.  Virtually everyone is at the peak of their form.

Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld (the fictional version of real-life Melvin Weinberg), a con-artist who is 'drafted' into working with the FBI to expose corruption during the ""Abscam"" scandals, and he's a joy to watch. Amy Adams is Sydney Prosser, seductive British partner to Bale's Irving Rosenfeld, and it's her best role to date.  She's both funny and sexy as she works several different men in the FBI scheme she's been 'drafted' into.  Jennifer Lawrence is also one of the pleasures of ""American Hustle"", garnering some of the film's biggest laughs without ever forsaking the believability of her character.

David O. Russell has had a good record of making extremely enjoyable films, and many of them display a great sense of artistic achievement.  He started in the early nineties with some provocative and daring independent films (""Spanking the Monkey"" and ""Flirting with Disaster"", two marvelous black comedies) before making his first masterpiece ""Three Kings"" in 1999, a darkly comic war film about the first Iraqi conflict, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.  His subsequent films went from the esoteric and incomprehensible ""I Heart Huckabees"" to more grounded filmmaking with ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"", both Oscar winners and both excellent showcases for actors.  Some say Russell seems to emulate Martin Scorsese's direction here (especially the early parts of ""Goodfellas"" sans violence), but is that a bad thing?  Russell, even in his less accomplished films, has always had an affinity for directing actors masterfully, but in ""American Hustle"" he excelled himself in juggling his superb cast in a perfectly integrated ensemble.

The acting is superb and the script is wonderful,  I even saw complaints about the costumes of all things, but anyone who lived during the era knows that yes, people really did dress that way (not me, but I had more taste than that).

6093994,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" begins with one of the best opening scenes in recent memory. Before we see anything else, we see Christian Bale -- the guy who played millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne not that long ago -- meticulously arranging, pasting, and spraying into place a terribly elaborate and truly hideous comb over. It's funny, and it tells us volumes about this character. He's a con man, a master at the art of deception, and a very careful one. Every detail has to be exactly right, ""from the feet up"" -- all the way up to the fake hair.

But he's gotten himself into a situation where nothing's right, everything is slapdash, and he's out of control. It's only a matter of time before he ends up in prison, or worse. That's all thanks to Bradley Cooper, an FBI agent who caught on to one of his small time schemes, and is using it as leverage against him and his partner, Amy Adams into larger and ever more dangerous schemes, until they're looking at taking down powerful politicians, and ending up on the wrong side of the mob. Bale isn't happy about any of this; he's a small fish happy in his big pond; he'd rather be scamming gambling addicts than having a sitdown with Robert De Niro.

Some of this actually happened. The film is based on the ""Abscam"" scandal from the late '70s, loosely. The historical situation is pretty crazy in and of itself, and indicative of the dysfunction in American government and culture in the '70s. (""Argo"" this ain't.) In a nutshell, the FBI grew tired of being reprimanded by Congress, so the feds launched an operation against Congress itself. It involved a fake ""Arab"" seeking to invest millions into New Jersey's slumping economy, and willing to grease whatever palms necessary to get the casino licenses, citizenship and anything else needed to get the job done. Abscam brought down several Representatives and one Senator on bribery charges, but it also resulted in something called the ""Civiletti Undercover Guidelines,"" which basically was the Attorney General telling the FBI to never do anything like it ever again.

It's a situation a little too messy for a straightforward film adaptation, but David O. Russell likes to make messy movies. Russell's signature talent is his ability to both create and control chaos onscreen. He loves to set crazy characters on colliding paths, and knows there are infinite ways to play crazy. It's hard to imagine any other director managing the scenes Russell manages, scenes in which three or four or five crazy people bounce off of each other at odd angles in fantastically entertaining ways.  He's also skilled at swinging from zany to serious (and back) at the drop of a hat. It's kind of like watching Real Housewives: these people are nuts, but we care about them anyway. Actually, it's infinitely more entertaining than Real Housewives.

Russell has developed a consistent stable of actors he likes to work with -- or who like to work with him. Rumor has it he's an extremely demanding director, known for feeding improvised lines to actors from alongside the camera during shooting. Also, there's a video on YouTube of him ranting and raving at Lily Tomlin during the shooting of ""I Heart Huckabees,"" though Tomlin afterward said that everything was fine between them and she'd be happy to work with him again. Some can't take the heat, and some thrive in it.

Amy Adams is better in Russell's movies than in anything else she's done, and so is Bradley Cooper. Cooper has earned Oscar nominations for his two performances in Russell's films, despite playing basically the same character in both of them (manic and naive, goal-driven, desperate, prone to violent outbursts but somehow forgivable and even innocent.) I'm not convinced yet that Cooper is a great actor--I'd like to see more range in his performances -- but he has without a doubt created a very watchable character performance that can span multiple films. In that way he's kind of like Al Pacino or Woody Allen.

Christian Bale, on the other hand, is a man of a thousand faces (and mannerisms, accents, etc.) If the Oscar always goes to the actor who uglies up best, Christian Bale got robbed. He gained 50 lbs and looks terrible. I guess that's not as impressive at Matthew McConaughey losing 50 lbs., but McConaughey is still rodeo-sexy through most of Dallas Buyers Club. Bale just looks bad here, and that's good. It's amazing to me that the same guy can play Batman, Patrick Bateman and a crackhead boxing has-been who once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard (or maybe he just tripped.)

But Jennifer Lawrence, who can seemingly do anything, might be the best part of the movie. She plays Bale's wife, whom he can't seem to get away from (he calls her ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate."") She routinely steals scenes by playing absolutely, but uniquely and distinctly, bats*** crazy. She's the opposite of her nail finish--she's mostly rotten and a little bit sweet, and you can't get enough of her. You just keep coming back.

""American Hustle"" is a zany, screwball ride, but it's also a movie about survival and reinvention. It's about people who are conning themselves, who are desperate to get out of their situations and maybe their skins. Ironically, the only characters who have a firm grasp on their real identities are the cons. Bradley Cooper thinks he's a hotshot FBI agent, but really he's small potatoes with too much ambition and not enough ethics or loyalty. Jeremy Renner thinks he's a big-hearted mayor who does everything for the people of New Jersey, but he's on the take, and in bed with the mafia. Best of all is Jennifer Lawrence, who thinks she's taking care of her family by setting the microwave on fire and ""motivating"" her husband by nearly getting him killed.  Amy Adams, meanwhile, grows tired of playing a part and just wants someone to be real with, and Christian Bale knows he's a small time crook and has no appetite for bigger fish. In the world these characters live in, ambition is the greatest sin -- ambition and lying to your friends.

Random Notes:

I loved Louis C.K. as Cooper's boss.  The ice fishing story!

Amy Adams British accent is terrible... but is it terrible on purpose?  She's a stripper from Albuquerque, after all.  If so, what does it take for an actress to purposely affect a bad accent?

I didn't like Jeremy Renner.  His performance was the only one in the film that didn't work for me.  He's supposed to be New Jersey through and through, but take away the hair, and he might as well be from Orange County.

This keeps getting compared to Scorsese and ""Goodfellas,"" but the similarities seem superficial to me (the costumes, big songs on the soundtrack) Russell definitely has his own voice as a director.",1394755200,85,6731,4.796200345423143

6093997,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"I hate to sound rude but.... the truth is, my perception is that those who gave this movie horrible ratings or claim they ""fell asleep"" is simply because they just could not keep up with the plot. You have to truly pay attention to every detail, but boy does it pay off. The twist ending rivals that of Catching Fire (for those who didn't read the books.) The acting is phenomenal, there was no stand-out because every character played his/her role to absolute perfection. I especially loved Jennifer Lawrence as the psycho, bi-polar wife of the famous con-man, as she manages to come across as someone you absolutely cannot stand while maintaining a sexy, untamed woman's pull which you can easily see why she has such a pull on Bale. The chemistry between all the main characters is something you can't make up. The wit of the con artists is impeccable, perhaps because it is based on actual events, but Adams, Bale and Cooper pull it off in a sense that would make you think they themselves were the subjects of the sting. I saw this in theaters, and it was one of those movies where you debate peeing your pants because you don't want to miss a second. It's hard to compare this to any other movies because it's so unique, but if I were to compare it to other movies of the same caliber that I myself like to give potential viewers an idea of what they might get.... I'd say if you liked Casino, Goodfellas, Blow, etc., you'll love this. Also, I saw this with FOUR friends, all of us with different tastes in movies, two of us were excited to see this, two were not, but we all left giddy and wanting to go back to the time period it happened and live the lives of the characters (even though they were criminals, we wanted their lives... goes to show how well they sold their parts!) So again, I can't help but speculate that the people who claim they were 'bored' or 'fell asleep' simply did not understand the movie because maybe they were expecting a Hollywood Blockbuster with predictable plot twists and endings like most movie-goers. Don't let those people deter you from seeing this. If you end up truly hating it, which I doubt, at least you",1394668800,157,2154,4.483460559796438

6094013,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Last year, a film about a top-secret 1979 CIA mission to rescue American diplomats during the Iranian hostage crisis took home the best picture Oscar.  This year, David O. Russell looks to keep this trend alive with American Hustle, a stylish story about the top-secret 1978 FBI sting operation, ABSCAM.

David O. Russell has been an exciting filmmaker for several years now.  His previous three films, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and now American Hustle, have thrust Russells notoriety into a new echelon, however, by examining his previous quirky, clever, and unique films, Russells evolution can be clearly perceived.  1996s Flirting With Disaster showed Russells quirky comedic tone.  In what some consider his best film, 1999s Three Kings showcased Russells clever style.  Additionally, 2004s I Heart Huckabees solidifies Russells unique writing.  Now it seems hes hit his stride as his previous three films represent all three of these talents repurposed and mixed with tremendous results.

Russells renaissance involves making films about memorable characters with his emerging cast of regular actors.  Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, Jennifer Lawrence, and Amy Adams have all been in at least two of his last three films, and all of them have received at least one Oscar nomination as a result  including two winners.  While rumors swirl around Russells ease to work with, he is able to coax performances from his actors like none other, and American Hustle is no exception.

American Hustle opens against the gritty backdrop of 1978 New Jersey with a tone-setting title card that reads Some of this actually happened.  We are immediately introduced to con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) who runs a fledgling at best money lending scheme.  That all changes when he meets the seductive Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party.  As a team, they bring Rosenfelds scheme to the next level attracting the attention of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).  DiMaso uses his leverage on the two con-artists to coerce them to cooperate with him in a series of operations designed to entrap high ranking politicians and power brokers including New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner).

Now the story might seem complex enough as it is, but under the guise that some of this actually happened, Russell does this story one better with the introduction of Irvings impulsive wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who could be the one who sends this whole operation crashing down.

Bale gives another transformative performance, this time with an added 60 pounds, a comb-over, and a Bronx accent.  Adams continues her quest to become this generations Kevin Bacon by being in a movie with every relevant actor in existence.  She also gives a very strong performance as the mysterious Sydney who is hell-on-wheels wrapping every man around her finger and perpetually driving Irving crazy in the process.  Lawrence steals every scene she is in as Irvings wildly capricious wife who won't grant him a divorce and doesnt know how to use a science oven either.  Renner and Cooper are very effective at representing both sides of the law in this wildly outrageous story where the line between hero and villain is very, very thin.

Mayor Polito wants nothing more than to re-invent Atlantic City and make New Jersey a better place, but with his hands tied politically, he seeks the necessary capital from a seemingly interested Arab investor who is actually part of agent DiMasos operation.  Thus, what makes American Hustle most intriguing is Russells conscientious effort to construct an irony where con-men and FBI agents are working together to ostensibly take down a criminal who may be the most honorable character in the film.  American Hustle does have one element working against it, running time.  At around 130 minutes, most of which is rapid dialogue, the film feels a bit bloated.  There are many characters and they all have a lot to say.  From an acting standpoint, it is quite impressive, but from an audience standpoint the film slags a bit through its second half.

There is plenty to like about American Hustle, far more than whats not to like.  For those looking for an amazingly well made and well acted film that does not include the brutality of slavery or the primal fear of being lost in space, this is your movie.  B+

American Hustle is rated R and has a running time of 2 hours and 9 minutes.  Keep any eye out for some great and surprising faces in some of the supporting roles.",1393891200,2,4530,5.0133689839572195

Many of the scenes did remind me of New Jersey and the areas I grew up; there is this one scene where they show the mayor's house and I could swear I saw this house in Haddonfield. Amy Adams has never been my favorite actress but she did an amazing job and, in my humble opinion, she beat out Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine (Yes I saw that movie too). The camera angles are sometimes off in the movie, I found myself wishing the camera would pan out so I could see all the actors who were talking, but I think the director was going for an authentic 70s movie feel. So this movie is a good watch and if you start it and find it is slow give it about 45 minutes and it picks up. The last scene between Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence is Amazing.",1393804800,,867,4.076023391812866

Not perfect, but very, very good. Vivid, watchable characters making mistakes, being impossible and getting stuck in their impossible selves - just like people in real life. The performances from all the actors are excellent and the scene-writing is both tight and twisty. My favorite: Irving (played by Christian Bale) goes into unload on Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and winds up thanking her.

Favorite dialogue (except I can't remember it exactly): (Irving) ""You shouldn't do anything to someone you wouldn't want them to do to you. I think Jesus said that.""

(Carmine) ""Yeah?""

(Irving) ""Also, always take the favor over the money. I think Jesus said that, too.""

6094019,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Suggested by actual events of the Abscam sting in the 1970s, the FBI plans to setup and arrest corrupt politicians. How they get the officials and the professional con artists that help the sting operation are the basis of a nostalgic film.  As directed and co-written by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), American Hustle is an acting clinic highlighting a convoluted tale of men and women who are looking for a big score.

In 1978, ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), forces con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), to help arrange a con on white collar crime, specifically targeting corrupt politicians.  Richie wants to make a name for himself, and he is immediately attracted to Sydney and has designs on her beyond the con.  Starting with a local, beloved mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), high level political figures are drawn in, and there is the possible organized crime connection. Further, Irvings wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), threatens to derail the sting.  As Richies grand plan comes together, things get more complicated and risky, and Irving and Sydney must rely on their skills to survive.

These are very well etched characters.  Each has something to gain, and each has an angle to exploit, whether its Richies dreams of a big bust or Rosalyns threats to expose the operation.  Kindred souls and survivors, Irving and Sydney have mastered the art of deception and manipulation.  You feel a degree of sympathy for Irving despite his criminal past and his marital discord.  Not only does he love his women, but he tries to save a friend from jail.  Irving turns out to be someone to root for.  In fact the world is not black and white especially when an FBI agent breaks the rules and gets involved with one of the principals.  Carmine is the noble, elected official who truly believes in doing good for his community.  Just who are the good guys and bad guys? Just who is conning who?

Memorable scenes include a catty confrontation in a womens restroom, the faceoff between Richie and his beleaguered boss (played to great effect by Louis C. K.), and an incredibly tense meeting with a head mobster (Robert DeNiro in a lethal cameo).

Acting is superior throughout as expected in a Russell ensemble with the principals at the top of their game.  Bale transforms his physical appearance as an overweight, balding schlep (a far cry from The Dark Knights Batman).  A sultry Adams (Doubt, Her) has a great time playing a kindred con artist with a British accent.  Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) has a ball as the gung ho agent with a 1970s perm who will step over his boss to get his time in the sun.  Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Winters Bone) excels as the wife who exhibits a bold brashness in public which delights her onlookers but risks blowing the sting.

There is liberal use of 1970s pop songs which blend with the costumes and hair styles seamlessly.  The camera work is fluid and is reminiscent of early Martin Scorsese films. There is a very carefree attitude in the films look and feel which is consistent with this loose, uninhibited decade.

A slice of the seventies with freewheeling hustlers and loose morals, at its core, American Hustle is a love story centering on Irving, an imperfect con artist and the women in his life.  The film is essentially a con within a con and keeps you guessing until the end.  Although the films narrative is not as tight as it could have been, Russell has sacrificed a tiny bit of substance for style.  Do admire this film for the many scenes that pit flawed characters against each other.  Acting does not get much better than this.",1393632000,5,3697,4.799368088467615

I hadn't read about the film before I went to see it, so I didn't know who the actors were going to be. I kept trying to figure out who was playing the lead character, but I never did. When the credits rolled, I was astonished to learn that it was Christian Bale. Now, that's real acting when someone so well-known was not even recognizable to me in that new role. My opinion of Mr. Bale's acting ability really zoomed at that point because I've gotten tired of long-time actors just playing themselves again and again in new films. But, the other actors in this film all did a fine job, too. I'm going to buy the DVD so that I can see the bits of dialogue on captions that I missed hearing at the theatre.",1393113600,23,832,4.20625

You see all the awards it's been getting, amazing quotes from critics, and your expectations are set way too high.

I liked it a lot, but not as much as other people seemed too. When I decided to see it a second time, I tried to put all the hype aside, and I enjoyed the movie considerably more.

 The film follows Irving Rosenfeld, played by Christian Bale, a con-man who runs a corrupt loan business alongside his seductive partner Sydney (Amy Adams). When busted by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), he is obliged to work together with him to lineup the arrests of several other people including congressmen and mafia members.

With awesome costumes and music choices that set you right in the time period, the movie is enchanting from the start. It may be a tad too long, but the cast of off-beat and interesting characters make up for that in the end. Christian Bale is certainly the standout, and seeing his performance a second time solidified that. Go in with a clear head, and you will most-definitely enjoy it.

Their plans for additional arrests get out of control when some persons (including one crime figure) get involved in an unexpected way.

Directed by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook), American Hustle boasts an impressive cast including Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner, plus one veteran Oscar winner in a cameo role.

However, considering the unique subject matter of a real-life sting operation ABSCAM, and stellar cast as well as the great soundtrack (including some rare ELO tracks), American Hustle should have been more engaging. The films dialogue-heavy script, especially the first half of it, suffers from the uneven pace, sometimes feeling like sprawling not knowing where to go. Actor all did great job, though Jennifer Lawrence seems miscast in a role that should be much older.

The film begins with words Some of this actually happened. Thats fine with me as long as the result interests us. Despite the great material, however, I somehow couldn't find the film that way.",1393027200,29,1230,5.14

Why are all the critics raving about it, and WHY is this movie winning all the awards? Loosely based on the Abscam stings of the late 70's and early 80's, I did think the acting was very good, and anyone who could dream up this screenplay deserves some type of recognition. For me, it was an overlong parade of Amy Adams displaying $8,000 worth of hair extensions, and clothing cut to her navel, Christian Bale with a pathetic comb over, Jeremy Renner with a ridiculous pompadour, and Bradley Cooper with his white man's afro. At least the ""dos"" gave me which gave me something to watch, because otherwise the movie was pointless, and actually, boring. My biggest thought watching it was, when is thing going to end? Reading about all the praise being heaped on this movie, proved to me, critics don't always know what they are talking about, so don't take their reviews as gospel. If this movie goes on to win the Oscar for best picture, over films so much better, it will be the greatest joke since 'Saving Private Ryan"" lost.",1392768000,7,1340,4.533057851239669
6094027,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O Russell teams up again with actors from his previous films - Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and uncredited Robert de Niro from Silver Linings Playbook; Christian Bale and Amy Adams from The Fighter. One thing is guaranteed - starring in a Russell movie will get you a nomination or a win at the various awards. (Melissa Leo won an Oscar for the Fighter - who can forget her acceptance speech?). This is no exception - apart from Robert de Niro's brief cameo, all four of the abovementioned actors have been nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in this movie, with a couple of award wins to date. With such a stellar cast, how can it miss?

Christian Bale once again immerses himself fully into his character - con man Irving Rosenfeld - padding an extra 50 pounds onto his frame. His portrayal of the psychotic wraith Trevor Reznik in The Machinist, for which he lost 60 pounds was spellbinding. Robert de Niro's cameo as Victor Telegio was brilliant!

But Jennifer Lawrence (Rosalyn Rosenfeld), an exceptionally versatile actress, is simply too young to be convincing in her role, despite her outstanding performance. She is 23, but could easily pass for 18. Amy Adams' (Sidney Tosser/Edith Greensley) inconsistent accent, can't make up its mind whether to be British or American (with even the occasional Aussie twang).  She does not switch easily between her twin roles. She is just too scrawny to exude sex appeal - her low cut dresses hint at boobs, not cleavage. The neurotic but ambitious Bradley Cooper as FBI agent Richie diMaso, with his tightly permed hair is so OTT as to degenerate into a caricature. His mannerisms are Jewish, his appearance Arabic/Jewish - he ain't no Italian! His hysterical temper tantrums, evident in Silver Linings Playbook, may stereotype him for future roles. The supporting cast did better overall, particularly Jeremy Renner's Mayor Carmine Polito and Louis C.K. as Cooper's much abused supervisor Stoddard Thorsen.

Without spoilers, the movie is a sting operation, with con artists Bale and Adams being forced to team up with Cooper for immunity when they get caught red handed. Loosely based on the ABSCAM scandals of the 70s and 80s, it is drawn out, overwrought and failed to hold my attention, despite a few really funny throwaway scenes . At over 2 hours, it is too long.

It just goes to show that despite a muddled plot, overlong scenes and some mediocre acting, not uncommonly the voters on The Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas etc. clearly see merit where I don't. As always, far more deserving actors/movies are ignored out there. Joaquin Phoenix, despite numerous nominations, failed to win a single award for Walk the Line. Go figure. . .

However, as the plot moves to conclusion the action picks up as you find that you shouldn't try to con a conman.

Bale was wholly unrecognizable as a pudgy Jewish conman who becomes more likable as the film goes on.

Bale and Lawrence were such a great comic duo together that they should try it again together. They have real screen chemistry.  He had a lot of romance chemistry with Adams but the laugh out loud comedy he did with Lawrence is much harder to achieve.

6094036,2,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle is a crime comedy-drama film loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970s and early '80s. It stars Christian Bale and Amy Adams as two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to set up an elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (Jeremy Renner). Jennifer Lawrence plays the unpredictable wife of Bale's character.

Its hard to believe in the relationship or any chemistry between Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams). They seem to be people who would never genuinely attracted to one another. Sydney appears to be too sophisticated to have any true feelings. Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) seems to be so disrespectful of him that its hard to believe the lengths she goes to keep (?) him. Lawrence compensates for her Rosalyn's character flaws with unbridled energy but her emotional outbursts and screaming wears annoyingly on the nerves.

Bradley Cooper's performance of the FBI fluctuates between blind self-assuredness and insecure cockiness. It becomes entertaining to watch his character get his comeuppance.

In the film, Camden mayor Carmine Polito is shown as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam to provide jobs to his constituents but its unrealistic that a person such as Irving would go to the lengths he goes to for Carmine.

The sheik scene is so fruitless in that it doesn't seem that it would have ever been believable. It all seemed to be a build-up to something that never came.

American Hustle is a unceremonious exploration of the lengths to which people are willing to go to ""create"" their ""life."" Sometimes the Hustle seems to be the dance the film makes in genre. The artistic choices are very interesting. Sometimes its a drama; sometimes dark comedy; that takes turns into elements of movie musical.",1391299200,3,1864,5.038961038961039

This is but the first deception. As the story unfolds, there is more and more elaborate deception and intrigue. It's a clever and intelligent story- a black comedy and cautionary tale.

Besides the clever story, the 1970s setting is recreated with care- and the soundtrack includes some excellent music from the era.

6094038,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Those viewers with long memories might notice resemblances between David OI. Russell's film and George Roy Hill's THE STING.  In both works, the principal center of attention is on the psychology of conning; how people can render themselves perfectly plausible to their victims and get away with it.  However there is one important difference: whereas the earlier film took a jokey approach to the subject-matter (complete with Scott Joplin-inspired ragtime score), AMERICAN HUSTLE takes a long hard look at the lives of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and sidekick Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and shows how their lives are fundamentally empty.  Although Rosenfeld protests his enduring love for his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), it's clear that his main focus of attention is on sustaining the con.  When it threatens to get out of hand, he tries to withdraw, but finds himself unable to do so.  Likewise Sydney; although she is a masterly impersonator of a British aristocrat, she has nothing much else to fall back on.  In the world of late 70s New York, it is every person for themselves - even the cop Richie DiMasso (Bradley Cooper) is out to exploit everyone around him.  In the end, Irving and Sydney come to a decision - the only way to extricate themselves from difficulty is to plan the ultimate con.  Their lives will not improve as a result, but at least they will be safe for a while.  AMERICAN HUSTLE is a long, controlled, brilliantly acted movie.  Director Russell's camera focuses on the protagonists in minute detail, taking a long hard look at their relationships, while suggesting that such relationships only work if the con works successfully.  If the con fails, then relationships come crashing down.  The late Seventies New York atmosphere is brilliantly evoked; the city is both attractive yet terribly seedy, a place where only the fittest survive.  The soundtrack, with hits from the period, only serves to enhance this mood.  This film has been nominated for several awards, and justifiably so.",1391126400,3,2029,5.054054054054054

The start of the film doesn't represent the start of the events portrayed in the movie, but we don't know that, so the sense of bewildered confusion sets in right away. From what I can gather American Hustle is about a small time con merchant (Christian Bale) who hooks up with another con merchant (Amy Adams) to fleece various gullible folk. The FBI pounces and yet with startling speed, the agent handling the case decides to use Bale and Adams to entrap a local mayor he thinks is corrupt. The story is based very loosely on the Abscam scandal of the late 1970s and I wish it had stuck to the facts, since they can't have been as confusing as this mess.

down the line like he planned (sort of), the con artists manage to win a little wiggle room

It was just down-right entertaining! Wolf was equally entertaining but sometimes a bit much. AH is a film I will want to see again and again and own it in BluRay and digital copy. I prefer digital over UV, as it is always available in my iTunes, no matter if I'm in air space or where ever. Just a fun film and tremendously talented actors!!

6094045,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle follows on director David O. Russells Silver Linings Playbook that proved to be a hit last year in 2012. American Hustle is more a madcap comedy as we follow two con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) in the late 1970s. Irving and Sydney are kindred spirits and deeply attracted to each other, as they play off of Irvings business loan scam where he takes $5,000 from his clients and gives nothing back. He also sells art forgeries on the side to which Sydney adds some class by affecting a British accent and turning herself into Lady Edith Greensly. Sydney eventually discovers that Irving is married to a flaky blond named Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and the two women despise each other.  All is going remarkably well until Irving and Sydney are caught scamming by an FBI agent named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).

Richie is not the sharpest tool in the shed gets wrapped up in Irvings stories on how he conned people. Richie thinks that in the post Watergate 70s he can make a name for himself by setting a trap for unwary crooked politicians. Only he needs Irving and Sydney as players to pull his scheme off. Richie picks the mayor of Atlantic City Carmine Polito as his victim, who needs to rebuild his city to get people into a newly built casino.  When bribery fails to lure Polito into Richies trap and Arab investor is invented and Abscam is born. Little by little, the scam becomes more complicated until the mob gets interested.

American Hustle is fun to watch because one never knows what is coming next, and everyone is conning someone else. Christian Bale is excellent as Irving, someone who could convince you that its in your interest to hand over all of your money to him. He fits into the 70s fashion with his hair piece and comb over hiding his bald head and his loud shirts and trade mark neckerchief. Amy Adams personifies the post-1960s ""liberated woman, with her loose filling clothing and lack of underwear. Her clothing gives Sydney a liberated and bold appearance that fits her character well. Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful as Irvings manipulative wife, throwing insults at Sydney when they meet and almost blowing the scam by spilling some of the details to a mobster.  Bradley Cooper does a great job playing the ambitious but over reactive FBI agent who can barely control himself when it comes to ordering his boss to give him more money for the scam.  It was also good to see veteran actor Anthony Zerbe as Senator Horton Mitchell, brief as his part was.

How about this: Adolf Hitler (Christian Bale) is really an alien - and FDR (Bradley Cooper) is a robot - and Eleanor Roosevelt (Amy Adams, who needs no makeup for this role) is having an affair with Empress Nariko (Jennifer Lawrence). If you think that's a great idea for a movie then I guarantee you will love American Hustle.
Every film has something in it that doesn't make sense. But this one lays it on with a trowel.
Bale's and Adams' characters are conducting a finance scam. You give them thousands and they promise to loan you tens of thousands. This is not a Ponzi scheme - which would involve investments, not loans. It could only work if the con artists vanish as soon as they get your money. But these two stick around, have a real office, and intend to do this indefinitely. In other words, it makes no sense whatsoever.
When they are arrested, the FBI wants their help because they are ""experts"" on running a con. Go figure.
It gets worse.
Adams' character talks with an ""English accent"" which comes and goes - and would be convincing if your idea of the West End of London is Camden, New Jersey. Her FBI handler does not know who she is, even though he earlier arrested and kept her in a cell for days. Despite this lapse of basic police proceedure, the FBI trusts her and her boyfriend with two million dollars of taxpayer money. (I hope nobody from al Qaida is reading this.)
Adams is supposed to make targets of the scam think she is a London banker. Only if British banks staff themselves with Las Vegas hookers would it make sense as to why Adams wears an open blouse apparently glued to her nipples.
If you can swallow all this, then you should also have no problem with the scene where an FBI agent pummels his superior and the assault is regarded as just a merry prank.
I give this film two stars only because of Jennifer Lawrence, who is a national treasure. But having her here is like keeping the family jewels in a trash bag.",1390262400,9,2079,4.374677002583979

In the process, Cooper falls for Adams believing she is British if not an aristocrat, which she claims.

6094054,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Anticipation for American Hustle for myself at least, was off the radar. I really do need to stop putting such high expectations on movies and just watch them for the enjoyment. So today, I will talk about American Hustle.

American Hustle introduces us to Irving. Now Irving is not just your average typical man living in the 1970s, no no no Irving is a con man. And even though Irving is married to Rossalyn with whom he shares a son Danny, he is having an affair with a woman ""Edith"" who coincidentally enough is also a con artist. While things are going good for Irving and ''Edith'', their schemes are soon halted by a man Richie DiMaso who is not actually a con man but is actually a FBI agent. In exchange for freedom he commissions Irving and ""Edith"" to help him set up some arrests and just like that we have our movie.

For the most part, American Hustle was everything I hoped it would be. I laughed a lot(in a good way) during the movie, mostly at Jennifer Lawrence's character Rossalyn. It is no surprise she was nominated. Bradley Cooper sports quite the hairstyle but he does his job well as Richie DiMaso. Amy Adams was stellar as our con artist ""Edith"". And Christian Bale shows why he is nominated for his role as our main character Irving.

To keep my review short, I would honestly say that American Hustle is a Good not Great movie. I did not expect to feel that way going into this movie, but I would not call this movie great. Still, I cannot call American Hustle a bad movie. The story line is interesting (and be prepared to laugh) and the overall setup of the movie itself was nicely done. Nowhere near the greatness I expected, but American Hustle gets rated

David O. Russell, now a shining light in the American film industry, has returned after his recent success with ""Silver Linings Playbook'. His new entry for the Oscar competition is 'American Hustle', which is loosely based on the ABSCAM scandals of the late 70s and early 80s.

Russell's new picture aspires to be an updated 'Goodfellas'; except here, the protagonists are not Mafiosi but low-rent con artists. The story begins slowly as a narrator fills in the background of the story's anti-hero, Irving Rosenfeld - part legitimate owner of a couple of dry cleaning establishments out on Long Island and part unsavory loan shark and middleman for art forgers. Christian Bale as Rosenfeld does the most convincing job of the principal actors in conveying just how this petty criminal fell from grace (notably Bale gained fifty pounds for the role).

Less successful is Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, Rosenfeld's con artist girlfriend who pretends to be a British aristocrat ('Lady Edith Greensley'). There's just something about Adams that prevents me (no matter how hard she tries) from believing that she can play the role of a true 'bad girl' (others, of course, are free to disagree).

The break into Act Two occurs when the FBI catches Irving and Sydney perpetuating one of their loan scams and forces them to help flush out four new marks. Sydney wants to flee the country, but Irving refuses, since he's still married and has a young son. As it turns out, the film's antagonist really is Richie, played by an over-the- top Bradley Cooper - a belligerent FBI agent, who continually pressures Irving to cooperate and browbeats his own boss to accept some of his far-fetched plans.

Russell has been quoted as saying that he concentrated more on the characters' stories, rather than the overall plot. Nonetheless, a good deal of the dialogue is improvised and I found many of the interpersonal scenes to be unnecessarily drawn out (Jennifer Lawrence has little to do as Rosalyn, Irving's over emotional wife, who eventually comes to accept that Irving is no longer attracted to her).

Many of the principals' machinations are supposed to be comic in natureparticularly those of Richie, who at one point slugs his boss in the face with a telephone. Ritchie reminds me of Cooper's character in 'Silver Linings', who also can't control his temper.

Unfortunately, it's really the 'Hustle' story itself that leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a story virtually devoid of any high stakes. The whole idea of course is that this is a story of low stakesand we're supposed to feel bemused by the characters' pettiness. But much of the pettiness simply isn't very compelling at all.

We have such low moments in Act II, as Sydney convinces the FBI secretary to make the $2 million unauthorized wire transfer and then Richie's boss' boss, Amado inexplicably green lights Richie's escapades. The bulk of the machinations involve Richie's quest to entrap Polito, the corrupt Camden, New Jersey mayor. The closest we get to high drama is when Polito brings Irving's fake sheik to a casino party, where they end up meeting a real mobster, Victor Tellegio, a former Meyer Lansky associate played by Robert DeNiro. Tellegio tries to outfox the 'sheik' by speaking Arabic, but Irving's friend turns the tables by showing that he knows Arabic too.

The rest of 'American Hustle' is anti-climactic. With the Camden mayor's assistance, a number of Congressmen are taken down, after they accept bribes. The big 'twist' at the end is too little and too late. It's not necessary to reveal the ending, but suffice it to say that the FBI's plan to fry some bigger fish, goes awry.

I'm not sure whether it was that I didn't really care too much about the principals and their back stories, or whether the twists and turns in the plot amounted to nothing more than 'small potatoes'. I do know that the film's Hollywood happy ending has nothing to do with what happened in real life (the wife committed suicide and the mistress divorced Mel Weinberg, Irving's real-life prototype, and no longer talks to him).

If there's anything good to say about this film, it has more to do with the re-creation of the late 70s era, replete with all those golden oldies on the soundtrack. It's too bad that most of the characters here never rise above the level of caricature.

The subjects of the real hustle appear to have been all those critics, who lapped up this overrated cinematic sleight of hand, in their desperate desire to discover a new Scorsese-like auteur.",1389916800,28,4588,4.883033419023136

6094058,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Knowing the pedigree of a movie, not only who the stars are, but who the director is, who the writers are, can easily help us separate the mutts from the pure breeds in the movie world. And if the pedigree is one of huge prior success of many of these elements then that augurs well for the success of this movie.

David O Russell directed the highly regarded The Fighter from two years ago which secured 7 Academy Award nominations, Academy Awards for Christian Bale and Melissa Leo,and a nomination for Amy Adams.

He wrote and directed Silver Linings Playbook one of the outstanding movies of 2011/12, which secured an Academy Award for Jennifer Lawrence last year, and a total of four acting nominations including Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, and nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

American Hustle reunites Russell, De Niro, Bale, Lawrence and Adams from these previous two hits, and continues the outstanding pedigree displayed in those movies.

Loosely based on the 1970s Abscam scandal, this is a multi-layered entertaining movie, involving a con man and his mistress, played by Bale and Adams, an emotionally tempestuous wife played by Jennifer Lawrence, organized crime elements represented by De Niro and others, and law enforcement interests played by Bradley Cooper.

I remember an interview Amy Adams gave two years where she complained that a journalist wrote that she did not have a sexual image at which she took great umbrage. Perhaps this was due to characters she played such as the Princess in Enchanted, or the nun in Doubt. She lays that particular criticism to rest in this movie playing a very sexual character, who wears skin clinging outfits, and no bra, ever. This all works to create a very alluring persona, and so she really pushes the envelope in this movie. I think her performance is the most memorable and nuanced of all the actors. Bale's character has a glued on comb over and that hairy thing does not fool anyone.

The other memorable performance that distinguishes this movie is that of Jennifer Lawrence. Two scenes in particular, one where she and her husbands mistress have a confrontation with an interesting turn. Very amusing.
The other a spectacularly messed up scene which I call the 'power of intention,' scene which had the whole theater laughing and for me was worth the price of admission. Another scene where she intensely lip-syncs I also found highly amusing.

Amy Adams has been nominated for Academy Awards four times for Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter , and The Master, without winning yet. Maybe this will be her year. I think she has shown great variety and ability in her roles. I particularly liked her turn as a rough tough warrior type role in The Fighter.

One thing that can be said for David O Russell, he knows how to write good roles for actors as all the acting nominations indicate. American Hustle has been nominated for seven Golden Globe awards, which augurs well for its Oscar ambitions.

American Hustle opened in limited release in the USA on December 13th 2013, achieving a highly impressive $76,000,000 in only three weeks of release. The movies most likely to win awards are mostly released in December perfectly timed for awards season, and this is definitely a cut above most movies you will see this year with some highly memorable scenes.

I think most people will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",1389657600,5,3428,4.874570446735395
6094059,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Most Hollywood films celebrate working class values and no film does that better this year than AMERICAN HUSTLE. What's weird about this movie though is that neither of the characters who are trying to do good are rewarded but both of the hustlers get exactly what they want: each other. Neither the Bale or Adams characters are loyal to their class (they'll hustle anyone) but they are ultimately loyal to each other. Bale is maybe the more sympathetic character (his schemes are just about money but he really doesn't want to hurt anyone) but the Adams character is far more mysterious, she hustles people not just for money but to prove something to herself -- to prove to herself that life is not determined by the accident of birth or class affiliation. Her roles are opportunities to explore her sexuality, intellect, imagination, and sense of play. To her the real is not some stable property/commodity with a fixed value but whatever you believe it is and get others to believe it is. Although the film like most other Hollywood films praises working class types, it undermines the notion that working class types are one-dimensional and/or incapable of participating not just in the American dream of social mobility but the even more compelling dream of identity mobility. Director David O Russell is clearly on the side of the working class and he loves showing working class types enjoying working class pleasures but in American Hustle he adds at least one new pleasure to the working class repertoir: the joy of conning people from the upper classes. At the beginning of the film Bale and Adams will con anyone regardless of class but by the end of the film they have affirmed their class loyalty and only after doing this do they seem to understand themselves and to be as merry if not as socialist as Robin Hood. American Hustle does play like a Scorsese film with one important difference: the racketeering raconteurs in America Hustle actually find a way to go legitimate (or at least as legitimate as any Modern ""artist"" can be). So what you have in American Hustle is the first existentially complex working class con dramedy. I'd give it a Globe.",1389484800,,2167,4.8123324396782845
6094060,1,B00GMV8M2Y,"This movie is a confused mess.  Having seen great con movies like The Sting, this will leave you significantly underwhelmed.  Most of it doesn't make much sense, especially around how their ongoing con business works - they talk about upgrading to a nicer office in a permanent location? What is stopping someone that they ripped off from coming back and getting their money back?

The characters are surprisingly flat and one-dimensional despite the good actors and actresses involved. I think they tried the best to make it work but the screenplay is so immature it's like a kid wrote it.  Every thought and motivation is broadcast across the characters' faces.  Not something you'd expect from con artists.  Whoever is backing this writer/director really must be just into looks without substance because a lot of detail went into the costume and setting which came across looking good.  Shame that it still doesn't make the actual core story any better or more watchable.",1389398400,20,975,5.0186335403726705
6094061,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"American Hustle is a disappointing chaotic and beautiful mess of a film with a plot that becomes convoluted with every con, twist and turn, and by the end you won't care about the plot, and leave the theater wondering what you just watched. American Hustle is thankfully saved by the excellent cast, and the eclectic cast of characters in the film.

Yes I was a little disappointed with American Hustle, and the overall plot of the film. Thankfully what makes American Hustle such a good film are the actors and cast of characters. Christian Bale stars as Irving Rosenfeld a small time business man who owns a few dry cleaners, but makes most of his money as a con artist. The character is balding, overweight with heart problems, but doesn't let his limitations stop him from getting what he wants. It was a welcome change to see Bale in such a different role from the suave good looking dark knight Bruce Wayne, and Bale again shines as Rosenfeld. Just like Rosenfeld, Sydney Prosser is determined to escape her old miserable life as a stripper into Edith Greensly. Amy Adams is superb playing the dangerous, sexy, and complicated Sydney. While Rosenfeld and Prosser find love together a con artist is a con artist and will con even the people he or she loves like having an adopted son, and Rosalyn Rosenfeld a stay at home unhinged wife who is terrified of change. Now Lawrence was funny playing the fierce Rosalyn with raw and primal energy, and Rosalyn slowly grows throughout the film, but it wasn't Lawrence's best performance of her career, and not her best performance this year. Still even with it not being her best performance Lawrence still shines throughout the film, and is worthy of an Oscar nomination.

As for the rest of the cast the majority of them gave good performances. Michael Pea was great playing a FBI agent who poses as Sheik Abdullah, and Robert De Niro was splendid in his brief role as Victor Tellegio. The only questionable acting choice or character in American Hustle was Jeremy Renner as Mayor Carmine Polito. While I like Renner, and know the character was necessary in the plot for Irving to come to some realizations the actor and character just didn't seem to fit, and left the role lacking throughout the film. I am somewhat divided on Richard DiMaso and actor Bradley Cooper. I know director David O. Russell loves to bring out the dark and crazy side of his characters displaying to the world that we're all have a few screws loose, but Russell and Cooper to DiMaso to the extreme as the FBI agent entraps Irving, and Sydney forcing them to help him nap other criminals. While at times laughed and really enjoyed Cooper playing the ambitious DiMaso the character could at times be off-putting and just plain annoying, but with the quality of acting, and Russell's directing these small flaws didn't keep me from enjoying the film.

I guess I should speak briefly about the plot as that was what I had the biggest problem with while watching American Hustle. The film is very loosely based on events in the 1970's, and written by Eric Warren Singer and David O. Russell. The plot involving DiMaso using Irving, and Sydney to get an ever growing number of politician and criminals becomes more convoluted as the stakes get higher, and everyone is conning, and using each other to get what they desire out of the situation. That plot drags on for too long, and by the end I just didn't care about that part of the story, and if you look at it that way, and just focus on the great cast of characters, and how the plot is there for the characters to evolve grow, and change than the story does work.

David O. Russell is at his best crafting great characters, and bringing out the best in his actors as he has done in Silver Linings Playbook, Three Kings, and The Fighter, and continues to do so here with American Hustle. There is something I've noticed with his directing. Russell loves writing flawed and slightly unhinged characters as well as dipping his feet into the darkness of those said characters yet never truly submerging into the darkness which I enjoy, and continues to do so here with American Hustle. Russell could have easily taken a darker turn with the film, but wanted to display people's ability to change, and grow showing everyone has hope for the future no matter how messed up they are, and I enjoy that about Russell. If there was a flaw to his directing of American Hustle it would be in his writing, and how he put the film together, but I believe what we got was Russell's attention all along, and it just didn't work completely on film, and again that was a small complaint to Russell great directing job in American Hustle.

American Hustle does disappoint in the story department most likely keeping the film from being nominated or being a serious contender for best picture award at the Oscars, American Hustle certainly doesn't disappoint in every other department from an excellent cast that includes Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence, and Bradly Cooper where Lawrence, Adams, and Bale are the crowning jewels giving Oscar worth performances to the wonderful out of this world characters that spring to life as well as the music, and top not directing by David O.

6094062,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I can honestly say that American Hustle is one of the best movies of the year. This film had an amazing plot line of deceit and false promises. I'll be frank, seeing Bradley Cooper finally play a loser made me feel a little better about myself as well. The main characters all have such strong personalities that clash incredibly well together. The story is told from a start at the end and go back to the beginning sort of perspective that really works for this movie. Hustling is such a common thing that we overlook in our society, but it happens every day. American Hustle explores what it is like to actually hustle for a living and what the consequences are when you are caught.",1388966400,2,684,4.48
6094063,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Irving (Christian Bale)is a con artist. His wife (Jennifer Lawrence) is flaky so he has a mistress Edith (Amy Adams) who helps him in his cons. When she gets pinched by an eager FBI agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie) they are asked to assist the FBI with four arrests and then they would be let go. Irving reluctantly agrees and Edith helps against her better judgement. The plot leads us to Irving being involved in a bust of organized crime figures (Robert De Niro), something that would lead to his demise and that of everyone he loves. He is in over his head. During the film you know everyone is scheming, but who is going to come out on top?

This is another classic con artist tale. It is a crime/thriller/drama/comedy. The acting was superb which made the script look substandard. Amy Irving is perhaps the sexist we have seen her to date. I never miss a film with Jennifer Lawrence who proclaims ""Thank God for me."" Her role starts out minor but then grows. The ladies room kiss with Amy Adams is something I predict will be on loop.

Seems like a good old fashion con artist film with some fine acting.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. Brief sex. No nudity. Stripper with pasties, most likely Amy Adams body double as face is not shown with nearly bare torso.",1388880000,,1260,4.517543859649122
6094064,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I had been looking forward to seeing American Hustle since it was announced. I almost saw it on release day, but I have an aversion to watching movies with people who are more concerned with noisily eating their weight in popcorn than watching what is on the screen. Yesterday's viewing was still pretty packed, but I am glad I didn't wait any longer. The movie is a lot of fun.

There's something a little jarring about David O. Russell's movies. I think it's the amount of conflict present between his characters. Have you ever been to a party or a gathering where people are all talking at once? It can be chaotic. There might be little gems of information hidden in the cacophony, but it's easy to miss. If you have seen The Fighter, you'll know that Russell's characters were often at each others throats. In Silver Linings Playbook, the central romance wasn't fully realized until the participants had survived numerous arguments. American Hustle feels similar in many ways to both those movies, although the canvas is broader and more colorful.

The movie opens with the statement, ""Some of this actually happened."" Well, the 1970s certainly happened, but I doubt that many people resembled the main characters in this story. The opening scene sets the tone by showing Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) fixing his hair. This is an elaborate process involving glue and a comb-over. IMDB states that Bale gained more than 40 pounds to play the role, and herniated two discs while perfecting his slouching posture. It's quite a transformation. That opening scene is a clear statement that American Hustle is not going to be a serious drama, and the movie rarely deviates from that initial statement of intent.

Rosenfeld is an interesting character. He spends most of his time conning people out of their money, promising loans for those who can make a down payment of $5,000. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and the two form a partnership and are attracted to each other. The plot becomes more complicated when an intended mark turns out to be FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). To avoid going to jail, Rosenfeld and Prosser agree to help DiMaso convict four corrupt officials, starting with Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner).

What follows is a complete mess. Does Rosenfeld really love Prosser? Will he ever leave his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence)? Is Prosser in love with Rosenfeld, DiMaso, both, or neither? The story contains a delightful cameo from another Russell regular, a science oven, a fake sheikh, great music from the 70s, fantastic performances from the main cast, twists, humor, intrigue, and plenty of laughs. Is it coherent? Not completely on the first viewing. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely.

Jennifer Lawrence isn't in many scenes, but she's fascinating every time she appears. Bale and Adams dominate most of the story, and are ably supported by Bradley Cooper, who has become a much better actor than I once imagined. It's interesting to see these Russell favorites make fun of themselves. Lawrence is borderline crazy, Bale almost unrecognizable, Adams more manipulative than most of her former characters, and Cooper willing to act like a fool. Is this the sort of chemistry that develops when directors continually use actors that they have worked with in the past? I love seeing directors such as Lynch, the Coens, Darabont and Tarantino going back to the same actors repeatedly. I think it adds something to the performances.

Like a Tarantino movie, American Hustle is more about style and the journey than the actual plot. It's simply fun to watch these characters interact. Don't expect a clever scam along the lines of The Sting. Just enjoy the wild ride. I already can't wait to see it again, despite its imperfections. I have a feeling that I will end up loving the movie once I have allowed it to sink in and with repeat viewings. The same was true for Silver Linings Playbook and Jason Reitman's Young Adult.

If you're perceptive and still reading, you might have noticed that I haven't talked much about the plot. This is one you need to experience without knowing too much going in. If you're a fan a Russell, or the main actors, you'll come away with a smile on your face. If you're not, this movie might just convert you.

For now, the overall score is 4/5.",1388880000,41,4331,4.867028493894166
6094065,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" is a laugh-out-loud funny, very clever, well-produced, well-acted movie about conmen, crooked politicians, and an FBI sting operation. I enjoyed it while I was watching it but it left me empty. I didn't care about any of the characters or the plot points. I wasn't rooting for anybody and I wasn't involved in anything. Ultimately ""American Hustle"" felt been-there-done-that to me, and gimmicky and shallow. It reminded me of a lot of previous films about lovable gangsters and conmen, like ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Sting,"" and ""Guys and Dolls."" Christian Bale as petty conman Irving Rosenfeld reminded me of Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit.

The gimmicks begin as the movie opens. It opens on a shot of Christian Bale's fat and bloated stomach. Bale is famous for losing weight for his role in ""The Machinist."" Then he became buff and muscular for ""Batman."" For ""American Hustle"" Christian Bale gave himself a fat gut. His fat gut takes up about thirty seconds of screen time and Bale could have played the role without it. His gut took me out of the movie. I started thinking, not about the character or the plot, but about Bale's tendency to gain or lose weight for roles. I assume he's pushing for an Oscar. I felt manipulated.

The plot is pretty pointless. A small time conman, Irving (Christian Bale) and his conwoman girlfriend Sydney / Edith (Amy Adams) are recruited by FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) to snag crooked politicians, including the mayor of Camden Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets in the way and causes some comic mayhem. Robert DeNiro shows up as a dangerous Mafioso.

The production values are very high. The costumes are outrageous: velvet tuxedos and open shirts revealing hairy chests and gold chains. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are all decked out and paraded like models. In ""Night at the Museum 2"" Amy Adams wore tight, flesh-colored jodhpurs. Everyone talks about her butt in that movie. In ""American Hustle"" she wears plunging necklines and slit skirts. Everyone will be talking about her breasts and legs.

The direction is fluid and musical  you feel like you're on an amusing ride. 1970s pop hits make up the soundtrack and action is choreographed to fit the music.

The movie is laugh-out-loud funny, funnier than some films billed as comedies. It's hard to tell what genre the film is meant to be, because there are scenes where characters are obviously in pain.

The audience is conned as well as the characters onscreen. There is a surprise. The surprise felt pretty cheap to me. The surprise was executed not by cleverness, but simply by hiding information from the audience.

The performances are all fun to watch and very strong. Problem for me was that each performance seemed to exist in its own world. Christian Bale is doing comedy and parody. He is mocking the character he plays, and low class conmen in general. Jennifer Lawrence is weak. She is pretty, pouty, and young, but I didn't catch any acting talent. Bradley Cooper, as the FBI agent, is intense and grating in his hyper ambition and lack of smarts and caution. His character never came together for me, never achieved any coherence.

Amy Adams is the heart of the movie. She is fiercely intelligent, deadly, really, in her amorality and her love for her man. The real standout is Jeremy Renner as Camden, NJ, mayor Carmine Polito. Renner is from a completely straight, serious movie. He comes across not as an actor playing a role, but as the ""real"" Carmine Polito, though Polito is a fictional character based on former Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti.

""American Hustle"" depicts conflict between straight, square people who tell the truth and con artists who lie, cheat and steal. As is often the case in Hollywood films, ""American Hustle"" comes down firmly on the side of con artists. ""Everybody's a con artist!"" the film wants you to believe. ""Everybody lies, cheats, and steals!"" Hollywood would take this stance because Hollywood manufactures illusions.

""American Hustle"" alters history to make this position believable. ""American Hustle"" becomes heavy-handed in its insistence on manipulating its audience into liking two characters and disliking a third. Camden's mayor was not the saint the film wants you to think he was, and the real Irving didn't do the kindly things the film depicts him as doing. Camden, NJ, is a horrible place to live. Its population is shrinking. It ranks first in violent crime. Political corruption is rampant. In making a saint out of the mayor of Camden, David O. Russell sticks his Hollywood finger in the eye of New Jersey's poor and crime victims.",1388880000,15,4662,4.956466069142126
6094066,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" is a drama comedy genre film set in the late 1970s. The narrative mainly follows con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and their money making scams, but also the excessive desire of FBI Agent Richie Di Maso (Jeremy Renner) to stamp out white collar crime.

The colourful, vice ridden lifestyle of crooks Rosenfeld and Prosser provides the viewer with several interesting scenes, and the river of deception causes Rosenfeld to be constantly juggling all his dodgy personal and business enterprises, which is a regular source of viewer entertainment. But the storyline also exposes the so-called good guys as corruptible in their own ways, which ultimately places them a step or two behind the seasoned cheats. Seeing into the calamity of all their lives it becomes clear falseness is a currency they all trade in to try and get what they want from people, and may the best swindler win.

The costume, hairstyles and set designs masterfully capture the era, and an exceptional cast enables several twisted personalities to shine.

6094067,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Filthy, immense personalities with a shared lack of moral compass own the driver's seat in this lingering peek at a late-'70s government sting operation and the flawed individuals caught up in its net. While the titular hustle is, obviously, the driving force behind this film's plot, the lion's share of its effort is spent inspecting the players themselves, rendering each from a variety of different angles and lights. In fact, the first two acts concentrate almost exclusively on the cast, to the detriment of the heist itself - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a different approach than I'd  expected. Of course, that ratio is flipped on its head in time for the climax, when our slick set of con (wo)men abruptly realize they're in way over their heads and the audience lets out a collective gasp; ""Oh, crap."" Predictably, the A-list actors hit all of their notes with sly ease, with the best - Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence - completely disappearing into their roles. Poor Bale has transformed his body in this way so many times over the years - an enormous gut, meticulously bad combover and slumped posture epitomize this particular role - that it's hard to imagine he won't pay a steep price later in life. A few scenes are slower than they need to be, and the focus could stand to be a touch sharper, but without both indulgences this wouldn't be the film it is.",1388707200,2,1389,4.739669421487603
6094068,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Writer/director David O. Russell is quickly making a name for himself, and after seeing this movie, there'll be no letting up on the buzz he's creating.

Here's the scoop. Irving Rosenberg (Christian Bale) has a few small businesses in Jersey but he also dabbles in small time cons. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who is looking to changer her life. They up the con game together but get stung by FBI guy Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who holds them ransom so they can provide him with cons involving much bigger fish. They agree but all might be in over their heads in this game and it all gets really messy.

This has it all. It has a great script. I would need to view it again to untangle all the cons and schemes but it's smart to a ""T."" The script also gives us great characters who are played tremendously well by an equally great cast. There are no confusing these folks. Each is distinct. And each has an agenda. How far will they go to get what they want? Who's playing who? It has great direction. Russell always seems to know where to put the camera and made certain his set designers, wardrobe folk et al gave this a right on look of mid 70s New Jersey.

Back to the actors. Christian Bale emaciated himself for his role in ""The Machinist."" He was as buff as could be in the Batman movies. Here he puts on weight and sports a near reprehensible comb-over. Amy Adams has a couple of scenes where it appears she's wearing no makeup whatsoever. How many actresses would do that? Jennifer Lawrence is just plain great. This is unlike any role I'd ever seen her in. Her knack for turning something she screwed up into something she feels she should be thanked for put me in stitches. Brad Cooper is a real weird one as the FBI agent. He, like most of the other characters, has a hair issue. Jeremy Renner, as Mayor Carl Polito manages to turn a guy from someone you're supposed to think ill of to someone you genuinely feel sorry for is spot on.

I could go on but why bore. This is about as good a movie you'll ever see and it will stand up under repeat viewings. Check it out.",1388620800,2,2092,4.329081632653061

6094070,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"""American Hustle"" (hereafter ""AH"") is a reasonably entertaining and engrossing variation of the sturdy ""Small-Time Con Man is Pushed Into the Big Leagues"" plot.  The small-time con man is the paunchy and sleazy-looking Irving (Christian Bale) with ratty hair that has a life of its own.  Irving gravitates toward scams and fraudulent businesses because he remembers the racketeers and hoodlums taking advantage of his glass-selling father, and wants to be the on the winning side.  Mainly he dabbles in selling art forgeries and using the proceeds to arrange phony loans to desperate customers.  Somewhat amazingly, he attracts the romantic attention of a sultry, slinky red-haired distaff con artist Sydney Prosser (alias: Lady Edith Greensly) (Amy Adams).  Together they stage more lucrative, but still relatively low-level scams.  Irving keeps Sydney as a mistress and comforting muse and morale-booster because he is married to shrill, maritally frustrated, and seemingly dense Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence from the ""The Hunger Games"") and has a young son by her.  Almost inevitably, Irving and Sydney choose the wrong mark for one of their bogus art sales - excitable, eager, but somewhat meatheaded mama's boy Richard ""Richie"" Dimaso, FBI Agent.

To avoid jail time, Irving and Sydney agree to help ""Richie"" orchestrate an ""Abscam"" inspired sting operation intended to expose at least four U.S. congressmen for bribery and, I think, violation of immigration laws since a ""wealthy Sheik Abdullah"" (actually Paco Hernandez) offers to fast-track his American naturalization process for a hefty fee.  Somehow, all this action also involves ""slightly unscrupulous"" New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) and his desire to develop waterfront property businessess and casinos to help his constituents.  And that's the plot of AH.

Besides the reasonable pleasure of watching the scams (and counterscams and double-crosses) unfold and unravel, AH also vividly and convincingly re-creates the outlandish and kooky zeitgeist of the '70s with well-chosen '70s song classics (like Steely Dan's ""Reeling in the Years"" and Wings's ""Live and Let Die""), the occasional parties, and introduction of new gadgets like microwaves, which Rosalyn learns are hostile to aluminum foil.  Especially, AH does not forget the hair styles.  Irving isn't the only one with follicle trouble; his wife Rosalyn's 'do looks like yellow spaghetti; Mayor Polito has the Elvis pompadour; even FBI agent Richie (in a hilarious sequence) shows how he gets all the little curls in his hair as his mother yells at him to fix the fish tank filter. Richie's exasperated and brow-beaten FBI superior and mentor Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) provides some humorous bits as he tries to stop Richie from squandering funds on an entire hotel floor for the scam, and to relate and finish an ice-fishing experience he had with his brother as a kid. Jennifer Lawrence (as Rosalyn) is a hoot as the complaining ""bubblehead"" who nevertheless has valid objections against Irving's treatment of her and even advises him on a Plan B when one of his cons (can't remember which one) starts to go south.  From time to time, AH also provides voice-overs (mainly from Irving but sometimes from Sydney) explaining his philosophy, his motivation, and the movie's plot.

Thus, AH has its positive qualities, but for me the movie stumbled somewhat because it fails to follow Irving's credo to work on small, simple cons.  The straightforward plot starts to wind back upon itself as cons get conned and counter-conned and players get played and counterplayed.  Robert DeNiro's fleeting and almost-stereotypical but expectedly effective portrayal of mobster Victor Tellegio wanting a piece of the ""Sheik""'s action actually, I humbly think, needlessly complicates matters.  Eventually, at about the midway point, AH becomes, as another Amazon.com reviewer puts it, ""yawny"", and I momentarily lost track.  That was unfortunate for me, because the climax and denouement of AH, with some ironic turns and fates for characters we expected otherwise that the midway point might have explained.

Overall, I generally recommend the movie and its various retroactive pleasures (including predicaments that could have been solved by cell phones and Internet access if they had existed in the early '70s), especially the funky coiffures.  But try to keep your attention focused, because AH's con goes on and on and on, and might leave you behind if you're not careful.

6094071,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I saw this movie, as I usually do, by just showing up at the theatre and watching whatever movie is playing next knowing not a single thing about it.

On the positive side, the setting is 1978 and the clothes, music, cars all were done wonderfully.  I love a historical piece and this one didn't fail to show us some of the best and some of the worst from fashion in this era.  The soundtrack is diverse and appropriate and doesn't just stick to the same 20 songs we tend to hear from the late 70's.  Also, as story lines go this one was reasonably well executed and held my own interest for most of the 2+ hours.  I saw this one in a VERY crowded theatre and the audience seemed attentive and responsive to the 15-20 comedic bits.  In fact one woman in the front row very nearly choked to death on a piece of popcorn that happened to hit the wrong spot just as something funny was going on.

To the negative, the movie did have some continuity problems and the middle hour or so was a bit of a yawn-filled drag.  It seemed like a movie that was cobbled down from about 5 hours to 2 as characters made unexplained transitions between emotional states; I suspect an extended version might make slightly more sense but likely end up being fairly unbearable.

In summary, not the best movie I've seen in the past few months but it was amusing enough to justify the time spent.  Any movie featuring a comb-over as complex as the one in the opening scenes of the movie deserves at least 4 stars.",1388534400,8,1490,4.308243727598566
6094072,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"The bottom line about ""American Hustle"" is that for me, it was an uneven mix of drama and comedy as well as realism and escapism that left me scratching my head about what sort of movie its makers wanted it to be.  Another problem for me is the depiction of Christian Bale's character as a ""nice conman"" and making him the ""hero"" of the story and the FBI special agent as the (sort of) heavy.  Finally, the movie had a twist ending that I felt was wildly implausible and also completely dishonest with the movie's audience.

I really did want to like the movie (it had a power cast who did well with their characters...especially Christian Bales and Bradley Cooper.  Jennifer Lawrence did well as Bale's ditz of a wife although I thought she was a tad too young in the role.  The general outline of the plot was also interesting.  It depicted through a fictional lens, the Abscam investigation where the FBI (using a confidence man it recruited) ultimately caught a number of corrupt politicians, including US Congressmen and a Senator.

But I think it was a mistake to depict the story of the film from the perspective of the conman vice the FBI special agents, let alone show the FBI special agent who was his handler as an out-of-control drug abusing nutcase.  I found myself thinking, yeah, that's the way the real-life conman who Bale's character is modeled on (and who sold his ""story"" to the film-makers) probably remembers it, but I wonder how the FBI special agents (there were two handlers in real life) remember things.

This leads me to another thing that I really hated about ""American Hustle"" and which the movie ""Goodfellas"" which it imitates in some ways did not have...I'm talking about the ultimate fate of the protagonist and the moronic twist ending that does not play fair with viewers.

<spoilers for both ""American Hustle"" and ""Goodfellas"">

In ""Goodfellas,"" Henry Hill gets cornered by his own stupidity and greed and facing a long stretch in prison from the Feds or a bullet in the head from his former business associates, he becomes a cooperating witness.  His friends all go to jail and he survives, but the movie ends by showing him frustrated and lost somewhere in middle America far away from the New York milieu that was his home and his marriage over.

Contrast that with the ending of ""American Hustle.""  The conman played by Bales suddenly has pangs of guilt over betraying a friend (the corrupt mayor of Camden).  So --and this is all done off-screen until the big ""twist ending-- he manages to steal money the FBI was hoping to snare a mafia boss by staging a con against the FBI and his handler.  He then blackmails the FBI into going easy on his friend the mayor and giving him and his girlfriend a free ride on all the crimes they had committed.

One thing I hated about that was the way it was all hidden until after the fact from us the viewers.  Maybe some people don't mind a movie or a book doing something like that but I hate it.  It's a cheap trick, and it's not playing fair with the audience.  They still could have shown the ""lovable"" conman scamming the FBI but the viewers should have known what was going on.

(incidentally, in real life, the mayor did not get a light sentence at all but a very severe one; and the conman got very well-paid by the FBI for his work for them)

Also, I just gagged a bit at the way the movie sanitized the rather grubby real-life story of the conman after the Abscam case ended.  Yes, he and his girlfriend reconciled but their marriage eventually failed (not too surprising when the people involved were professional liars and cheats).  And his wife (Lawrence's character) wound up killing herself not long after the Abscam case became public.  Showing the conman and his girlfriend ride off into the sunset at the end of ""American Hustle"" made me think of the ending of an even worse movie ""Tequila Sunrise"" (where Mel Gibson managed to look heroic as a major league drug dealer and wound up with the girlfriend and the loot and his freedom).

So in the end, ""American Hustle"" is worth seeing for some great performances and some laughs along the way.  But it's nowhere near as honest a film as ""Goodfellas"" was.",1388448000,8,4216,4.600267379679145

6094075,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Powerful storytelling that is delivered with dynamic directing and editing.  The film builds on its themes with a virtuoso narrative engine that intertwines three main characters.  (Four if you count Jennifer Lawrence's ... but it can be well argued that her role is more of a large supporting one.)  The interior perspectives of the characters is delivered with voice over ... a technique that can go horribly wrong, but in this film works gloriously as it gives the audience an artfully skewed experience of the point of view of each character.  A multi-prismed tale of how some incredibly desperate, deceitful, yet compelling people view themselves, their hustles, their rules, their schemes for survival ... and the hustles and schemes and lies they must navigate as they crawl their way through an ever increasing complex and layered maze of cons and realities.

Visually this film is exquisite.  The camera work is impeccable.  Cinematic eye candy that is actually substantive.  David O. Russell uses dynamic camera movement and editing that is deliberately reinforcing of the content of the scenes.  The use of period pop music is unrelenting, but it is both spry and potent throughout.  The acting is nothing short of extraordinary. Which means much credit has to be given to Russell. These are great actors he is working with, but you don't get performances like that without diligent and forceful directing.

Christian Bale delivers what I think might be his best performance so far.  Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are amazing and they deliver scenes toward the end of the movie that are real firework shows.  Jeremy Renner is also wonderful.  The entire cast does an amazing job ... with a delightful and funny surprise turn by Louis C.K..

There is one false or too broad moment toward the end with an over-the-top bit of needle drop and Jennifer Lawrence's hair.  But I was so taken at that point, I was able to easily ignore it and give Russell a pass.

Yes, this movie has a popcorn sheen. But I think it's a clever and deliberate sheen that is cleverly designed to drive home fascinating themes about American ambition and self-creation.  And in that way it is very similar to Three Kings.  Another movie that appears on the surface to be just a light, popcorn action-adventure about hunting down gold in the Iraq war.  But the wonderful pop sheen is deliberately engineered to help us sit happily through a movie that really deals with dark and unpleasant elements:  greed, desperation, survival and the organ-destroying ability of bullets.  Three Kings takes on these themes on so many levels and so many manifestations -- from the goofy Spike Jonze character's absurd and pathetic ambitions to the national issues concerning ripping open a country with military might and leaving it to bleed out and its citizens to fend for themselves in the remaining wake of chaos.

American Hustle is built much the same way.  A camera-swooping, pop music-thumping, non-linear, dance-puzzle that delves into the darker aspects of conflicting realities, lies, cons and self creation.

Three Kings is a true classic.

American Hustle might very well be one as well.  It's too early to call.",1388275200,3,3196,4.981132075471698
6094076,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell started out as a director with a vision; he made the incredibly challenging films SPANKING THE MONKEY and THREE KINGS, and as the years went on, he seemed to tire of making films with something to say, and opted for performance-based Oscar bait. Both THE FIGHTER and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK are not bad films in the least, but neither of them really do anything to subvert audience expectations. Either of those films could have been directed by just about anyone. AMERICAN HUSTLE has a little of the former and a lot of the latter, but toes the line just enough to keep you interested and invested, and for once with Russell's recent films, you don't know how it's going to end.

AMERICAN HUSTLE is a highly fictionalized accounting of the real life Abscam scandals of the late 70's that involved some low to mid-level elected government officials as well as the Mob, and how it took a couple of con artists to teach the FBI how to properly catch them. You have Irving (Christian Bale) and his lover/partner Sydney aka Lady Edith (Amy Adams) as a great short-con artist team, as well as Irving's incredibly unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) on the ""family"" side. But once Irving and Sydney are busted by young FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper), they're behind the eight-ball. But Richie has bigger fish he wants to fry. He's sick of government corruption and wants to go after those who want to use their elected positions to accept graft, and in Irving and Lady Edith, he sees an opportunity to learn what they have to teach. He agrees to drop the many fraud charges against them if they will assist him in four arrests, and they reluctantly agree. The first person Richie wants to go after is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the beloved family-man mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Polito seems to be looking to get funds to assist with the renovation of Atlantic City to help create thousands of jobs his constituents desperately need. Once it gets to a certain point, though, thanks in no small part to the emotionally manipulative Rosalyn and the increasingly desperate Richie, Irving and Sydney seem to have no way out of what they themselves have been manipulated into.

Russell keeps the film at a really solid rhythm all throughout, and the actors, including Louie C.K. as Richie's FBI superior and a cameo by Robert De Niro as a feared Miami mob underboss, are all stellar. Bale continues to amaze with another chameleonic performance; Cooper gives what I would consider to be the performance of his career; Lawrence keeps hitting the bullseye film after film and is arguably the strongest actor of her generation and this performance is no exception; Renner gets past his misstep from being in HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS to being more on par with the performances he's given in the past. The strongest performer here for me is Adams, who always does incredibly solid work, but here, she's given a role within a role that she plays with gusto, intelligence, sexiness, and total confidence.

My main complaint about this film, though, is how it really does seem to be Scorsese-lite. Many indie filmmakers seem to feel the need to ape Scorcese at some point in their careers, and while it works in this film, I would have liked much more to see a film that was more of Russell's and less of a 70's-era homage.

All in all, AMERICAN HUSTLE is exciting and entertaining filmmaking that could have used a boost of originality, but let's face it: Russell seems to really just want to get that Oscar. Or if not him, than at least his cast.

6094078,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Overall, I liked this film. Good writing, direction, and cinematography. I'll keep my eye on this director. Basically, this is a snitch flick with a moral, that is, when it comes to good and bad there's just varying shades of gray. Christian Bale and Amy Adams play grifters who are caught and become Federal snitches in an attempt to avoid lengthy prison sentences. Bradley Cooper plays the Federal  agent they must work with to entrap a network of very powerful and dangerous individuals ranging from mafiosos and politicians including an idealistic mayor effectively portrayed by Jeremy Renner who bares a strong resemblance to Joe Pesci's ""Tommy"" in Goodfellas. As I said earlier, the operative word in understanding this movie and its cast of ""good"" and ""bad"" guys is gray, because there are no sharp distinctions between the protagonists and antagonists in the film. This is what makes a film interesting and what separates films like these from ""Summer"" movies.

There were surprises in this film, not from the film, which I did not find original or groundbreaking in any way. Nothing very special about the film itself. What surprised me was the commitment Bale gave to his role. He looked downright sloppy and very pathetic, very true to his role in the film. As he did in The Mechanic, he morphed his body to fit the role of his character. Another surprise was seeing DeNiro, looking very old, very much his age as an old gangster.

The soundtrack fit the scenes perfectly. My favorite scene was a slow mo scene to Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road."" However, after a while the music felt like forced melodrama and became both predictable and annoying, though not enough to cancel out the film's positives. The cinematography was gorgeous and captured the feeling and period of the film. This was a Christmas Eve date film I wasn't excited about seeing but was very grateful I didn't miss after the credits rolled. Can't wait for it to come out on Blu ray.",1387929600,,1972,4.828402366863905
6094079,3,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russle wrote some pretty good movies. So he decided to write another one with basically all of the other actors that to work with him. None of the actors need introductions, and they all do an excellent job and the reason it's so praised is because of the dialogue and the actors ability to act. David enjoys writing movies with crazy characters, and this film over-indulged the idea. It's like he wanted to make a ""super-movie"" with all his actors, and it detracts from some of the other actors because it feels over crowded. It's also nominated for a golden globe for best comedy and if I didn't know that, then I wouldn't know it was a comedy. It's not a bad movie and has a pretty awesome ending but not worth the hype it's getting.",1387843200,6,745,4.405797101449275
6094080,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"Not only does the music bring back the late 70s of everything from Duke Ellington to disco, but the costumes positively reek of it, from velour for men to shameless for women. Christian Bale and Amy Adams are absolutely first rate, and Jennifer Lawrence gets a juicy stereotype to munch on.

But mostly, there is the story. Hustlers being outhustled and ending up being dragged into a hustle way out of their league. It's a long, involved process, and remarkably, it grips you throughout the length (2:09) of the film. The music helps, but the story stars. You have to pay attention, and it's worth it. The characters are clever and sharp, they live by their wits. They are pleasure to follow for once.

And the risk is real, for once. Any and all of the characters could lose out, right up to their lives. That gives the film extra power, compared to all the superhero and comic book characters who you know must come through no matter what. So suspense plays a significant role too.

You have take notice of the hair, of all things. Everyone's hair gets talked about, and there are several scenes of the characters doing their hair, particularly the men. Unlike today's rather conformist close cropped or shaved head, the 70's were exuberant, American Hustle is an exuberant piece of entertainment.

6094081,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Nine Things about American Hustle

1. This is a masterful film of American ambition woven into a gorgeous tapestry of 1970s style, fashion and music.

2. It is about ego, honor, self-improvement, and the necessity to re-invent oneself in order to make it in this dog-eat-dog world.

3. The story centers on Christian Bale, who plays a petty con artist named Irving. The movie starts off by detailing Irvings criminal career and his reluctant involvement with federal law enforcement.

4. Irving is also having problems at home, which leads him to fall for his partner in crime. While Irving wants to keep his professional and personal lives separate, they inevitably end up on a collision course with each other, and Irving ends up playing for much higher stakes than he ever wanted to.

5. For all the sleaziness of the story and characters, the movie has no nudity or blood. This is storytelling magic that doesnt rely on sex or violence to keep you interested.

6. This means that people who need sex and violence in their movies will likely be kind of bored.

7. Everything in the movie, from the fashion, to the hairstyles, to the story, to the actors performances, are slightly exaggerated, just a little bit larger than life. Not enough to turn into a caricature, but just enough to make everything seem to vibrate. The fact that the actors can actually pull this all off is amazing  the acting is uniformly brilliant, and there are no weak links in the cast.

8. The movie takes the old American concept of being a self-made man and cranking it up a notch. The characters are always looking out for themselves, and soon nobody knows who is on what side or if there are even any sides at all.

9. This is a movie not only about how we fool each other, but how we lie to ourselves, which is the biggest con of all.",1387756800,,1820,4.5552147239263805
6094082,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"David O. Russell just sounds like one of those 1970s directors, or maybe its David O. Selznick Im thinking about, who was a great producer in the 30s and 40s of many Hitchcock films, ""King Kong"" and most notably ""Gone with the Wind"". So David O. Russell really doesnt compare to Selznick other than the similarity of name and the fact that the big O in the middle seems to signify an association with quality films and Oscar nominated and winning films.

Russell has been flirting with Oscar trophies for 3-years now. First he directed ""The Fighter"", then ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and now he will most certainly be nominated for a third time for ""American Hustle"". He may not win again, but it would be a safe bet that at least one of the actors he cast in ""Hustle"" will walk away with trophy. While Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner were all outstanding in their performances, Id have to admit, it was Jennifer Lawrence that plays the smaller role in the film and steals the scene every time she appears.

""American Hustle"" is a throwback to when films about heists, swindles and double-crosses were the talk of the town. Its the kind of film that tests your true love for cinema. As the film plays out and we swirl around in Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams) a.k.a Lady Edith Greenslys worlds, its like a test of patience. Irving and Sydney find themselves getting deeper and deeper into trouble and the movie is exhausting with the banter, plots and plans. Your head will be literally spinning just hoping to keep up with their mess. While it was slow moving and littered with a barrage of oncoming information, its exactly how you should feel watching the film, because it is exactly what Irving and Sydney are dealing with.

""Hustle"" is a dance along the fine line that is right and wrong; survival and ruin. It is exactly what happens when a script, that should be nominated for an Oscar by the way, can either be mundane and boring or lifted above that by the performers of the roles. The performers in ""American Hustle"" do just that and then some. With humor and passion and great writing, you get caught up in the tornado of right and wrong, trying to figure out how to get off, just like Irving and Sydney.",1387756800,32,2260,4.589108910891089
6094083,4,B00GMV8M2Y,"I don't know what everyone else expected out of this movie, but I expected a little more. The acting was great as it should have been with that all-star cast and the production quality and styling of the late 1970's was equally good. The story however felt a little anticlimactic and unfocused. Having been at least partially based on a true story the payoff wasn't as big as expected. Something that didn't help it's case was the cinematography. The film could have been much more aesthetically pleasing, maybe David O Russell was too focused on making the film look 'indie'. One of the best things the movie had going for it was the sometimes subtle comedy, however the overall re-watch factor didn't really seem that high to me.",1387670400,8,731,4.71875
6094084,5,B00GMV8M2Y,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

I think I got my first laugh at the beginning of this movie when a tag line appears saying something to the effect of ""Some of the things seen here actually happened.""  Director David O. Russell and his co-writer, Eric Singer, make no bones about the fact they are making most of this up.  What is true and the basis of the film is the FBI entrapment scheme of the late 1970's called Abscam.  Several New Jersey congressmen, a U. S. senator and local officials were implicated in a bribe scandal to fast-track an Arab's American citizenship and other misdeeds.

In the movie the creator of the plot is Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale).  Bale is a far cry from his Dark Knight character, complete with a large beer belly and an atrocious comb over.  Irving is assisted by his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams).  They've been coerced by the FBI to pull off the scheme in order to get a pass on another crime which is their real pay day.  Essentially they sell fake art and obtain large deposits to get loans for people with no other access to credit.

The film has a similar feel as Russell's brilliant ""Silver Linings Playbook"" from 2012.  In fact he recruits Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro from that film.  Cooper plays the ambitious but inept FBI agent who leads the effort.  Lawrence, in another remarkable performance, is Irving's wife Rosalyn, complete with a piled high bee-hive hairdo.  De Niro has a small but very convincing role as the Miami based mobster who wants in on the action.

The film has the smart but formally uneducated group outfitted in the finest of the era.  Ugly by most accounts; still I have to say I certainly liked the slinky Halston-styled dresses.  The kind with a deep V-cut and a style that banished the bra.  Jeremy Renner does well as Camden Mayor Polito.  His hair almost reaches the heights of Rosalyn's.  The film is funny, dramatic and has some excellent individual scenes, especially those that include Ms. Lawrence.  To be sure this is a terrific film.  Well written with some authentic sets and designs and some solid performances.",1387670400,,2144,4.7196765498652296
