""If all men were angels, no government would be necessary.  In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this:  you must first enable government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.""  (James Madison)

  *****

This two disk set regarding the Constitution and Bill of Rights is solid in it's review by the two scholars who narrate it.  However, having said that, those of us who cherish our ""right to bear arms"" are not likely to be impressed by what can only be seen by most of us as their own personal ""interpretation"" of the 2nd Amendment.  The segment of population I belong to, have our own interpretation of the 2nd amendment because it is black and white:  that is ""right of the *individual* to bear arms"" - the ""rights of the people to bear arms"" are specifically mentioned in the wording - and not limited to a state militia as these two scholars would have you believe - the narrative statements of these two ""historians"" was nothing more than personal propaganda - or an organized agenda of some sort.  The militia as mentioned was made up of ""individuals"", all of whom owned their own weapons.  It is a cherished and absolute right given us by forefathers who had oppression by overzealous governments uppermost in their minds at the time.  That idea was born out centuries of the ""people"" being helpless, without protection, should an individual household come under attack; whether it be by robbery or by out of control government, which of course, none of us wants to think would happen.  But these forefathers lived shoulder to shoulder with fear, born of absolute knowledge of what can happen to an unarmed people.  It was the very crux of what the Revolution was all about.

That is the only real critique I will offer here - although I feel it's something that needs mention.  Otherwise, they were a good set of learning and refreshing tools, which I encourage anyone interested in United States ideals and government to keep refreshing on in order for the passion to be continually nurtured; a set of ideals within government that has lasted far longer than it might have, had we not supported it with our blood and energy for so long.  In fact, those were misgivings noted in the succinct words of Benjamin Franklin:  ""We have it.  Now it remains to be seen if we can keep it.""

James Madison's timeless influence spanned 200 years and returned in 1977 when the Amendment that became the 27th was resurrected and ratified after having been presented and failing to gain the majority vote required when it was first proposed.  The original states who voted for it were counted as positives from out of the past, and the remaining majority needed was finally obtained in 1977.  In a twist of fate not unlike that of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson passing together on the same day - Independence Day, 1826 - one can think of no finer tribute to Madison from the ""posterity"" he thought of and wrote for.  It seems somehow meant to be another reminder of how enduring their influence was.

In refreshing the second disk, ""the bill of rights"" and taking it into context with what is happening in government now, one feels a chill at how closely we may have missed the Asteroid; and how much credit should be given to the several visionary men who insisted on drafting the first of the amendments to establish those separate ""rights"" - Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, James Mason and James Madison - supported by John Adams.  And frankly, I don't know what we would have done without Thomas Jefferson.  He was/is the crown jewel in the ""crown of many jewels"" that were the Forefathers.

I hope we have another 500 years - maybe more, although I fear for it as they feared for it - of protection by the Constitution developed by men of high intelligence, tempered by the knowledge that ""no men are angels"", and willing to work through differences to ""establish and ordain"" the basis of future for the rest of us.  There has never been a more equitable and common sense form of government established anywhere - and in doing so, the forefathers also established the tools necessary to keep the bill of rights amendments open for change as centuries pass, but always by the ""balance of powers"" that keep us as safe as we can possibly be.

If I sound like a Patriot, I hope so - for that is what I am and will always be!  Never forget what we were given.",1335484800,12,4493,4.626733921815889

8022874,3,B00026L8KS,"Some great explorations: however..as I said about this company's production on the Declaration of Independence.. the ""expert"" pundits who contribute go too far into interpretation (in a few cases they even interpret the Supreme Court interpretations) even more so in this piece... and there is no distinction made that this is purely opinion when this happens. The outright declaration of the intent of the second amendment, for example, had to be corrected in homeschooling. Great example of how a single professor can skew the reality of the document. That said, can be used in cooperation with other materials for homeschooling quite effectively if  the instructor knows his/her constitutional stuff. At bit dry but effective, if you know where to make the appropriate corrections in lecture.",1395100800,4,795,5.36
8022875,1,B00026L8KS,In my opinion I detected a liberal bias in the presentation of the The United States Constitution. The explanation of the Electorial College was abruptly cut short.  But the explantion of the Second Amendment appears to refute the individual's right to keep and bear arm as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court's case of Washington DC vs Heller in 2008 and another similar case in 2010. Both decisions definitely affirmed the right to own and bear arms on a local or national basis. I expexted a more professional presentation of the founding documents of our USA.,1388361600,9,561,4.84375

It is a complete study of each document, but if I had my way it would have been narrated by an eloquent lawyer and be as entertaining and visually appealing as would be humanly possible.",1375574400,,315,4.543859649122807
