7910016,4,B00000IC91,"This dvd is fine except it does not contain a menu. It just plays each episode automatically without a cue. However, since there are only three episodes, it's not too annoying.",1293667200,,176,4.709677419354839

(It doesn't say so at the top but this set IS ""Set 1"".)

You can check out my full review of each episode there as well as my other more general comments about the series.

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211673600,,681,5.220183486238532
7910018,5,B00000IC91,"If you relish a series like ""Honey West,"" ""T.H.E. Cat"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Mrs. Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good.",972000000,,570,4.490384615384615
