8169932,2,B000MM0ZQU,This video is an entire 25 minutes in length.  About $1 per minute.  What were they thinking?  This should have been two hours.  And what was up with all the weird camera angles?  How can you corner the world's two most premeir abduction researchers and miss the mark so badly?,1223683200,,277,4.46
8169933,2,B000MM0ZQU,"I am giving two stars to this DVD - One for Yvonne Smith and one for Budd Hopkins. No stars for the DVD producers or the ""UFO investigator"" making the interview (questions).  I have been in the UFO phenomena (there are several UFO manifestations) investigation for more than 40 years. Although I do not know Budd Hopkins personally I know about him since he founded Intruders Foundation, which is still a very serious and active organization. Being myself a Hypnotherapist for 21 years I have the Hypnosis protocols developed by Hopkins and Jacobs and I have used these as guides with some of my updating methodologies. I respect Budd Hopkins very much. But I believe that he can very well do without this kind of recorded interviews. The questions were an improvisation from someone who does not look to me to be very well versed in the abduction phenomenon, and the camera operator is a disgrace...even though the DVD states that the recording is ""uncut and raw"". Listening to Budd and Ms. Smith was indeed a pleasure due to their sincerity and expertise...unfortunately, to add insult to injury the interview lasts only 30 minutes. Well, Oh well, the information which these two investigators have is so rich and the interviewer was not able to extract from them anything impacting or new to the subject anyway. So, the 30 minutes for this poorly produced interview DVD is more than what anyone could dare to spend watching this experiment in failure. As anyone could expect under these circumstances, the price of the DVD is too high for the end product offered.",1178841600,2,1566,4.821561338289963
8169934,4,B000MM0ZQU,"If you are interested in Alien Abduction, then you must be aware of Bud Hopkins. He is in fact the original pioneer here. He is not a madman nor a nut and he is not an eccentric as critics would have you believe. He is down to earth and seems like a very grounded intelligent person. Out of his work, John Mack became interested - another incredulous name added to the fold of alien abduction investigators. So I have tried to take a look at everything these men have written or filmed. This video has two very intelligent and credible people discussing the issues of abduction and the possibility of hybrids. It appears to have been filmed at a break during a recent lecture or symposium. The banter is very good and even ""delicious"" between Yvonne Smith and Hopkins. In the interview, they share some insightful aspects of their research such as the incredible similarities found in ""Experiencers"" they know, or are treating. They also discuss some new revelations I found to be quite interesting. The video jacket boasts that it is uncut and raw. The drawbacks are first, that the director attempts to be a little too artsy. He apparently has a hand held camera that he cuts to every so often that swings around, jumps in close, turns back and over... very distracting. To this I would add that some of the interviewer's questions are bit off track and seem a bit naive or uninformed for the field. Regardless of these only two negative points, I still really enjoyed the tape and was very glad to have purchased it. There are others in the series, and I will likely take a look at those too. My biggest complaint is that it was too short. I believe that it is only about 30 minutes long and I could listen to Hopkins for hours. This is a fascinating subject and a tasty look at a real pioneer!",1174953600,4,1797,4.4984709480122325
