8458436,4,B0055KO600,"John M. Stahl (1886-1950), Azerbaijan-born but Hollywood's seminal melodrama director in the sound era, made (besides the major weepies successfully remade by Ross Hunter) at Universal the neglected ONLY YESTERDAY and WHEN TOMORROW COMES, then matriculated to Fox for his operatic masterpiece LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN and then this similarly neglected addendum WALLS OF JERICHO, his final large-scale melodrama. It's just four minutes shorter than the Technicolor masterpiece, filmed in subdued monochrome by Arthur C. Miller, and a rather scathing (pre-Douglas Sirk) look at smalltown virtues and vices in our complacent Midwest, 1910-12.

Cornel Wilde repeats from LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN, as does Anne Baxter from Stahl's EVE OF ST. MARK, and they carry the film as collegial barristers. The castlist widens with Kirk Douglas and really fine character turns by Ann Dvorak as Wilde's dipso spouse and Linda Darnell radiantly on form as ""Algeria Wedge,"" Jericho's social arbiter, style maven--and vengeful woman scorned. Stahl knowingly juggles the usual smalltown tropes: gossip, illegitimacy, backstreet affairs, attempted rape, alcoholism, political cronyism, and this typical hamlet tributary to metropolitan Kansas City is intriguingly poised between urban and rural, Roosevelt and Taft eras, pastoral vs. upwardly suburban career opportunists. Jericho has its cowboy past, the saddlery still marketing handtooled chaps, boots and spurs, but the citizenry are fully modernized with telephones, player pianos and runabout motorcars. Darnell emblematically and overbearingly flaunts her big-city hats, a chic sheath skirt and her topflight pianola, and Baxter even more daringly challenges Jericho's professional norms as a fully skirted yet fully liberated lady barrister bucking the entrenched townie establishment. (Today she'd fight to restore and preserve the saddlery, and Darnell's pianola too.)

Wilde and Baxter monopolize their extended screentime, to the neglect of the more interesting Dvorak and Darnell characters, so too the diverse townsfolk Marjorie Rambeau, Henry Hull, Patricia Morison and Ann Doran. Still this is a deeper smalltown melodrama than Sam Wood's KINGS ROW, Baxter and Wilde have a tracking-shot walkabout (and canoodling scenes) that pay homage to Welles' Baxter in MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, and the insularity and steamy gossip of smalltown Kansas was elaborated just seven years later in Josh Logan's popular PICNIC. Stahl's vision--as compared with melodramatists influenced by or copying his style--is purer, more objective: these characters are (period costumes, pianolas and motorcars notwithstanding) what they are, and this great director intelligently trusts his mature audience to suspend any blanket abominations of this Jericho smart set, letting us delegate final judgments to heaven. As in LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN, Stahl's courtroom scenes are intensely dramatic and perfectly blocked (hostile witness Darnell exits in a huffy snit, staring down barrister Baxter), and it's worth noting that the film, despite the source novel's title, portrays a conspicuously unchurched community.",1505174400,,3117,5.863436123348017

Sort of Shakespearien plot with all kind of feelings in one movie",1368057600,2,117,4.363636363636363
8458438,4,B0055KO600,"Set in Kansas in the early 1900's, the friendship of an attorney (Cornel Wilde) and a newspaper publisher (Kirk Douglas) deteriorates when Douglas brings his new bride (Linda Darnell) into the small town of Jericho. She's scheming, manipulative and ambitious and will stop at nothing to further her husband's career. Directed by John M. Stahl (LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN), this is a wonderful, juicy melodrama along the lines of KINGS ROW and PEYTON PLACE. A small town seemingly respectable on the surface but when the layers are peeled, we find rape, murder, adultery, alcoholism, illegitimate children and political corruption! The kind of movie that if it were a book, you'd call a real page turner. While both Wilde and Douglas are both fine, it's the ladies who dominate the performances. Darnell is marvelous as the devious plotting wife, Anne Baxter as a still rare (it is the early 1900's) woman lawyer in a man's world, Ann Dvorak (Hawk's SCARFACE) as Wilde's bitter and shrewish wife and Colleen Townsend as the girl on trial for killing the man who tried to rape her. Music by Alfred Newman. With Patricia Morison, Marjorie Rambeau, Henry Hull, Barton MacLane, Ann Doran and Gene Nelson.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a nice B&W transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ration with removable Spanish subtitles.",1315008000,6,1311,4.959090909090909
