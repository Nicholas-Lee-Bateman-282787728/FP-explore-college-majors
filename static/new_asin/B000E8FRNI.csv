2509226,5,B000E8FRNI,"My son, not yet two years old absolutely LOVES this video.  He wants to watch it everyday.  He has learned so much from it and even shows the animal signs he has learned here when reading other books.  The songs are silly and fun.  A GREAT way to introduce animal signs to children and their parents.",1204156800,,300,4.303571428571429
2509227,5,B000E8FRNI,"GREAT dvd!  My 23 month old loves this dvd.  Although he's not really talking he's learning the signs for the animals.  I would say this dvd is more for older kids. For example, my son wouldn't know the differece between a chicken and a rooster at this age.  Great idea to add the non-farm animals too.  The songs are great and our entire family ends up humming on of the signing time songs!",1199577600,,391,4.301369863013699
2509228,5,B000E8FRNI,"All kids love farm animals, and this dvd presents them all with beautiful graphics and catchy songs.  You'll get up out of your chair and dance along to the title song, among others.  My son, who is fluent in sign language, really loves this episode!!  He has brought it in to school for his teacher to share with the class on a rainy day.  This is a must have for your young child's high interest sign language collection.",1199491200,,423,4.384615384615385
2509229,5,B000E8FRNI,"This video is much better for young ones because it has more songs, the songs are more upbeat, and it is faster paced.  My 15 month-old will watch it (though not for as long as Baby Einstein).",1190505600,,192,4.1891891891891895
2509230,5,B000E8FRNI,"Oh our family just loves this dvd. It is colorful and the music is so alive and upbeat. We have so much fun learning the signs for all the animals down on the farm. Their website is also fun,colorful and informative vist them online [...]",1175126400,,238,4.311111111111111
2509231,5,B000E8FRNI,Our school is currently using Signing Time in an after school program to introduce and teach American Sign Language to children ranging in grades K-6. Rachel does a good job of desribing and demonstating the signs. The music and songs create an enjoyable way to reinforce the new signs learned.,1155686400,4,294,4.9
2509232,5,B000E8FRNI,"As the mother of twins, one hearing and one deaf, I have had the opportunity to check out many programs for teaching ASL to small children.  This is by far the best series out there.  Most other products are so boring that parents must struggle to stay awake during the production, and there is no way a toddler would tolerate a viewing.  My 2-year-old twins request Signing Time all of the time.  At home they want the DVDs playing almost constantly.  In the car my hearing daughter starts asking for the Signing Time CD before I even have her strapped into her carseat.  My 2-year-old deaf daughter is using 5-sign sentences, which is almost unheard of for the deaf child of hearing parents.  My extended family owns a total of 6 sets of Signing Time.  Whenever my daughters' cousins have a birthday they ask for the latest Signing Time DVDs.  Children of all ages love this product.",1148860800,6,885,4.585987261146497
2509233,5,B000E8FRNI,My son has Verbal Apraxia and we are teaching him sign. This video is a great asset to our learning all the farm animals!,1141776000,5,121,4.083333333333333

2509246,5,B000E8FRNI,Rachel Coleman is amazing,1426723200,,25,5.5
2509247,5,B000E8FRNI,Great video for teaching not only sign language but also Language/Concept development.  Most children have never been to a farm so this gives them an idea of what they would see and hear.,1413590400,,187,4.666666666666667
2509248,5,B000E8FRNI,"This DVD arrived in the mail in a timely manner, works perfectly, and my summer school students loved watching!",1410912000,,111,4.894736842105263
2509249,5,B000E8FRNI,This has been such a great learning/teaching tool for our family. Its so much fun to be able to communicate with our 13 month old!,1388880000,,130,4.24
2509250,5,B000E8FRNI,"Catchy songs, funny scenes...Leah's Farm doesn't disappoint. My toddler has yet to sign anything from this DVD, but at least he enjoys watching it.",1373932800,,147,5.166666666666667
2509251,5,B000E8FRNI,My child does not speak so we are working on signing with him and though he is a literal thinker he loves to watch me do the signs and is starting to connect the action with words.  My child loves the songs and the interaction with the DVD's.  We also have Vol 1-6 and he loves them.,1365811200,,283,3.9473684210526314
2509252,4,B000E8FRNI,"These are a much better price than what is offered on the Signing Times site, but it is still quite expensive for a 30 minute video.  I love the features that allow kids to practice, and you can go in and play songs only if you like.  That's pretty cool.  My only complaint is it's pretty short for the price.",1362009600,,309,4.116666666666666
2509253,5,B000E8FRNI,"We really love ALL of the Signing Times, but this one is super fun.
The Leah's Farm song will be forever stuck in your head, which is great for reinforcing not only animals, but the signs for them.
I highly recommend this and ALL Signing Time videos. Kids LOVE learning things and this second language is FUN for kids because they use their hands.",1358294400,,347,4.4375
2509254,5,B000E8FRNI,I love these videos & so does my 2 1/2yr old.  It's amazing how many signs he knows now just from watching these dvds!,1356652800,,118,3.9166666666666665
2509255,5,B000E8FRNI,We love the baby signing time Videos. I'm really impressed by the number of signs in the songs. Each time I watch the videos I learn new signs. I recommend parents watch the sign reviews without their children so you can really feel proficient.,1356307200,,244,4.568181818181818
2509256,5,B000E8FRNI,"I got a few of the DVD's to help my grandson learn to sign, becasue he is having a hard time hearing and speeking.",1355356800,,114,3.7916666666666665
2509257,5,B000E8FRNI,My kids and I both LOVE the series.  So easy to pick up on and we have learned so many signs already.  This one is so far our favorite!!,1325635200,,136,3.6551724137931036
2509258,5,B000E8FRNI,"This video is great, my son loves it (he's been watching the series since he was 6 months) and his signing is progressing better than mine!",1312848000,,139,4.384615384615385
2509259,5,B000E8FRNI,"We borrowed one of these from a friend when my son was about 18 months and he loved it.  I'd been trying to teach us signing from a book but once he started watching these videos, he started signing much more words.  They are cute and entertaining and he asks for ""signing time"" all the time now.  I get the videos from the library but this would be a great gift (hint hint to the grandparents).  I will say the very first video is kind of basic and short but you can tell they were still working on their format and style.  They get better as you go.  If you search ""Signing Time"" online you can see how the videos came about and I really appreciate their organic beginnings.  It's a very touching story.  I'm so happy we discovered these videos!!!",1312502400,,749,4.26241134751773
2509260,4,B000E8FRNI,"I have volumes 1-4 of Signing Time. I love it. Not only does my little one learn, I learn sign language as well and the DVD's are fun. Lots of music",1305676800,,148,3.806451612903226
2509261,5,B000E8FRNI,"I love the Baby Signing Time and Signing Time line of videos.  They can be expensive, but they are so worth the money!  We started using the products when my daughter was 10 months old.  Now she is 22 months and has over 150 signs.  They are not all perfect, but she can communicate with us and always get her point across.  In fact she is now signing four and five word sentances such as ""I want more milk please.""

Don't let anyone try to tell you that signing delays speach.  It definitely does not!  My daughter was signing before speaking, but now she uses both.  There are many times we wouldn't understand her words, but because she is also signing, we know what she means.  This has eliminated a lot of the frustration that is normally caused when a 2 year old can't communicate.

The bottom line is that we can highly recommend the entire Signing Time series.  We love it and will use it again with our next child!",1290988800,,923,4.333333333333333
2509262,4,B000E8FRNI,I love the song Leah's Farm...and was in hopes that there would be lots of similar songs on the cd....But it is mostly signing training for the songs....Overall it is an OK album.,1287878400,,179,4.454545454545454
2509263,5,B000E8FRNI,My 18 month old son LOVES his signing time videos and so far this and the Zoo train video are his favorites.  He dances along and does most of the signs now.,1261094400,,157,3.90625
2509274,5,B000E8FRNI,"My daughter really took to Signing Time, and we have been buying a few videos at a time.  She is really into animals and loves the Leah's farm and Zoo time videos.  She now knows all the signs and I'm looking forward to learning more.",1257724800,,234,4.177777777777778
2509275,5,B000E8FRNI,Kids 5 and under love it.  they pick up the signs quickly and enjoy the music.  fun.,1256428800,,84,3.8823529411764706
2509276,5,B000E8FRNI,The item was a gift for my grandson and as far as I know he loved it.,1252108800,,69,3.1176470588235294
2509277,5,B000E8FRNI,Another A+ movie by signing time. My daughters love these and I do too! This has very good creativity and excelled music!,1239408000,,121,4.545454545454546
2509278,5,B000E8FRNI,My son who is now 19 months  has now learned most of the signs shown on these DVDs.  It's incredible how much he enjoys watching them and showing us what he has learned.  I have really had to pay attention so that I know what he is signing when the DVD isn't on.  This has helped in his communication so much.,1238198400,,309,4.016393442622951
2509279,5,B000E8FRNI,Our toddler is mesmerized by this video. He loves the music and the animals. The 'grown-up' in the video is super sweet too!,1232409600,,124,4.434782608695652
2509280,5,B000E8FRNI,I love all the Signing times. Not only do they help children learn ASL but they help me too.,1223769600,,92,3.8947368421052633
2509281,5,B000E8FRNI,"My son loves this, we went to the apple orchard this weekend and he tld me about all the animals using sign!",1220227200,,108,3.9545454545454546
2509282,2,B000E8FRNI,"I got 6 DVD's already and consider my purchase HUGE waste of money. Even though DVD's run in themes, you don't get all the words for the theme, rather you get a mix of words that don't really connect to each other when you watch the DVD. Music is boring, presentation is boring. My son got excited when I sat him in front of the TV for this, we just started signing to him and he was very interested, but was out of the room in 2 minutes and never paid attention to it again. I watched it and found the music annoying, people signing over and over, you can see their mouth is saying the signing word but you can't hear it, how annoying. Only couple of songs on each DVD, it's mostly people signing over and over in a BORING way. It's also very expensive for what you get. $15-20 per half an hour program. Ouch. They make you buy all the DVD's by cleverly spreading the important words in all the DVD's. We wounded up finding a great ASL dictionary online for FREE and use that to look up words that we want to use, rather than what is given to us. That works great and 2 months later our son can sign 40 words and he is only 16 months old.",1217462400,,1139,4.066666666666666
2509283,5,B000E8FRNI,"This whole series is great for a child who has some vocabulary and is starting to interact socially.  Some of the finger-spelling is better for an older child--or for the parent who's watching along.  My 16-month-old especially likes the ones with lots of animal names.  Leah's Farm has lots of farm animals and also several backyard animals like squirrels and frogs.  There is plenty of video of the actual animals, which is nice for kids who are still learning what they are.

There's great music on this DVD, and my little girl dances along even if she doesn't get all the signs.  It's fun for me to watch too!",1211846400,,613,4.577981651376147
8107022,5,B000E8FRNI,"Weve bought many singing time dvds and will continue to buy more. My little girls, age 4 and 1, enjoy watching this volume. I love that they are educational and they are leaning while watching a show. We love the catchy upbeat songs.",1525132800,,233,4.441860465116279
8107023,5,B000E8FRNI,"Signing time videos are wonderful learning tools for children .
Much singing and dancing along with child models .",1507507200,,114,5.052631578947368
8107024,1,B000E8FRNI,I love Signing Time and was so excited to replace my lost copy of Leah's Farm but the DVD arrived with the disk and some other loose piece of something sliding around inside of the case. Didn't even open and returned it.,1492732800,,220,4.261904761904762
8107025,5,B000E8FRNI,"Previously I've bought two other Signing Time dvds.  One day after being in the kitchen (away from the tv, but still being able to hear it)  I realized I was singing and quoting the entire Signing Time dvd that my son was watching.  Thats when I knew it was time to buy another Signing Time dvd.  This dvd (Volume 7: Leah's Farm) is super cute.  My son loves animals, so he gets a kick out of learning how to say all the animal signs. And he loves seeing all the animals displayed over the course of the dvd.  The tunes are catchy and even my 7 year old signs along.  The only thing I wish was different was that the dvd was longer, because it's so short we can watch it like 3 times in a hour.
I can't say good enough things about Signing Time.  I have used signing time dads with both of my children and I am amazed at the results.  My daughter and son started signing when they were around 9 months old, by the age of 1 yr they could speak about 50 words, my son is now almost two and he speaks in full sentences.  Signing time has definitely helped reduced the tantrums that my kids throw, and made my life a HECK of a lot easier (since I can understand what my kids are saying).",1469318400,,1183,4.060344827586207
