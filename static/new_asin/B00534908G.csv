So far so good.",1354060800,,137,3.6
8454971,5,B00534908G,"I grew up watching Audie Murphy westerns and loving every one.  The chance to get these four movies was too much to pass up.  Ride Clear of Diablo is the first movie I remember seeing at a drive in.  These are four very enjoyable movies.  All I am waiting for is the chance to get a copy of The Wild And The Innocent, which is I believe the last of his movies for Universal International, the studio responsible for some of the best movies of the fifties.",1353542400,,455,4.195402298850575
8454972,5,B00534908G,"These are some of the best westerns Audie Murphy been in and TCM and Universal did an excellent job of finally releasing these on DVD all on one package. There are four movies with their own respectful disc. The audio and video transfer are just perfect without any flaws I noticed. Each movie has their own features on the disc which would be; movie posters of that movie, scene stills, publicity stills, behind-the-scenes stills, british front-of-house stills and all movies have an intro of Bed Mankiewicz (so it's just like watching them on TCM and seeing the intro, but you can also play the movie without seeing the intro).

All movies are in Color and run for about 1hr and 20mins each. Only ""Sierra"" and ""Ride Clear of Diablo"" are Full frame and ""Drums Across the River"" and ""Ride A Crooked Trail"" are in Anamorphic Widescreen. By the way I don't know if these have any subtitles.

Here is the list of some stars in each movie and all movie of course star Audie Murphy:
-""Sierra"" stars: Wanda Hendrix, Burl Ives, Dean Jagger, Richard Rober, Roy Roberts, John Doucette, Tony Curtis, plus others and is Directed by, Alfred E. Green
-""Ride Clear of Diablo"" stars: Susan Cabot, Dan Duryea, Abbe Lane, Russell Johnson, Paul Birch, Denver Pyle, Jack Elam, plus others and is Directed by, Jesse Hibbs
-""Drums Across the River"" stars: Walter Brennan, Lyle Bettger, Lisa Gaye, Hugh O'Brian, Regis Toomey, Bob Steele, plus others and is Directed by, Nathan Juran
-""Ride A Crooked Trail"" stars: Gia Scala, Walter Matthau, Henry Silva, Joanna Moore, Mary Field, Eddie Little, plus others and is Directed by, Jesse Hibbs

Overall this is an excellent collection of western movies and I would recommend this.",1344902400,2,1702,4.841924398625429
8454973,5,B00534908G,"They actually made 50's westerns for adults and these were among them. Great scenery, gorgeous color, good acting and interesting stories. Enjoyed Audie westerns as a kid and this is a nice sampling of his work. Highly recommend for western fans and collectors of the genre. In fact, a western movie collection without Audie films would be incomplete, in my view.",1329868800,2,363,4.967213114754099

Directed by Jesse Hibbs, Alfred E. Green, Nathan Juran

1.) - Sierra (1950) - (83 min/Color) ~ Starring Audie Murphy, Wanda Hendrix, Burl Ives, Dean Jagger, Richard Rober & Tony Curtis
(Directed by Alfred E. Green) .... Based on a novel by Stuart Hardy.

2.) - Drums Across the River (1954) - (78 min/Color) ~ Starring Audie Murphy, Walter Brennan, Lyle Bettger, Lisa Gaye, Hugh O'Brian & Jay Silverheels
(Directed by Nathan Juran) .... Outstanding cast with Brennan & Murphy as Father & Son.

3.) - Ride Clear of Diablo (1954) - (80 min/Color) ~ Starring Audie Murphy, Susan Cabot, Dan Duryea, Abbe Lane & Russell Johnson
(Directed by Jesse Hibbs) .... Great role for Duryea as the snide, smirking Kincaid.

4.) - Ride a Crooked Trail (1958) - (87 min/Color/Widescreen) ~ Starring Audie Murphy, Gia Scala, Walter Matthau, Henry Silva, Joanna Moore & Leo Gordon
(Directed by Jesse Hibbs) .... My favorite pick of the four films, different Murphy here, with Matthau who almost steals the show.

One of my favorite directors of B-Westerns Jesse Hibbs gives all of his films a nice touch.  Hibbs directed 'To Hell and Back' (1955), Based on the autobiography of Audie Murphy who stars as himself in the film.

Special footnote: The Audie Murphy Westerns Collection presents four of his best entries in this popular genre, each digitally remastered.

This was his genre, of the forty-four films he appeared in, more than half of them were westerns.
