8164771,5,B000LXGV7M,"Personally have always enjoyed the director duo's filmmaking style, and they don't disappoint this time either.
This title might have not been a commercial blockbuster however it is an excellent work.
The direction is outstanding as one would expect from this duo, casting was just perfect specially that of Bobby Deol playing the wealthy millionaire.
Bobby Deol has proven himself once again that he is very much a capable actor with range.  His new look, customs, dialogues, everything about him just works.  His performance is fluid and effortless.  The script has given his character so many shades and he does not fail portraying them on the big  screen.
The music has a few pleasant tracks except when the dance groups starts performing! Found it to be a bit silly and unnecessary.
It is a movie that you can watch over and still enjoy every frame.
An excellent work.",1456704000,,873,4.878378378378378

8164773,5,B000LXGV7M,"When I was surfing trying to get an idea of this movie, the emphasis was on entertaining romance with Hitchcock twists and turns. The cover has a sinister set of stills and talks of man's dark side.
I don't like violent Indian movies and I wasn't sure whether this was for me.
Actually it was violence on a par with Hollywood action movies like Indiana Jones or Mission Impossible. They did have an extended fight scene at the end (when the resolution of the movie was very much in doubt quite a few times) but it was no more gratuitous in images than something like Spiderman.
What is very much to recommend about this movie is that the plot is well devised and there are many satisfying surprise twists in the last half.
The first half is focused more on setting a romantic web and has light musical numbers. Booby Deol plays a charismatic lover who is worth watching just for that (I'm not sure why he has concentrated on more action and violent flicks as he can express love and sensitivity so well when he chooses). The female lead is good (but I'm a female and may appreciate her acting rather than her charms!) The baddy (Akshaye Khanna)is stereotypically a cad and does that with believable finesse.
As with so many Indian movies the first and second halves contrast in their mood. The first half is light, romantic and full of music, romance and beautiful settings. The second half is well crafted thriller.
I found the violence when it did happen wasn't too sustained generally and was more action sequence stuff- and was endurable for those who don't like violent movies but manage occasional action.",1225756800,6,1611,4.636363636363637
8164774,4,B000LXGV7M,"Corny lead-in, yes, but then this whole crazy, over the top, wildly exotic, incredibly colorful hoopla takeoff on Hollywood musicals and thrillers is so 'too much' that it is an utter delight!  Some might think that the term 'Bollywood' is an affront to Hindi cinema, but it would seem from the extended trailers and PR before the opening of this movie that the Indians are the ones who created and luxuriate in the term.  At any rate HUMRAAZ is a spectacle and well worth the 173 minutes it takes to watch it.

The story seems at first to be rather simple, a mere decoration for a lot of music video style dances and songs.  Karan (Akshaye Khanna) is a handsome choreographer and lead dancer of a dance troupe trying to audition for a job on a multi-million dollar luxury cruise ship.  His partner (and lover) is the very beautiful Priya (Amisha Patel) and they sing and dance up a storm.  The ship's owner is the billionaire Raj (Bobby Deol) and when he gives the job to the dance troupe of the rival Fernandez without a fair audition, Karan sneaks into Raj's office to convince him to audition his troupe.  Priya visits Raj's office and Raj is immediately taken with her.  Karan visits Fernandez and in the confrontation Fernandez falls to his death.  Karan connives with Priya to marry Raj then divorce him so that they will benefit from a huge alimony and be the wealthy people they so envy from their working caste state.

The cruise begins and gradually Raj and Priya sing and dance into finding love, the dance troupe is a big success, and at various ports Raj teleconferences with his grandmother (Suhasini Mulay) about his new love and wedding plans are made.  Priya accepts Raj's proposal on the condition that she remain chaste for the first month of the marriage to prove she is not a gold digger (!).  The marriage takes place (again with much colorful song and dance) and Priya is at last a grand lady in a mega mansion.

Karan is caught up in is web of deceit and when Priya discovers the true character of Karan and the extreme opposite of Karan's evil in Raj, she pledges to honor her marriage and not go through with Karan's vile plan.  What happens in the last hour or so with this love triangle is nail-chompingly tense: even the martial arts routines are employed as well as pure Hitchcock melodrama mystery thriller twists and turns.  The ending is a series of surprises.  What started out to be a jocular and wonderfully silly song and dance extravaganza ends up as a quite good melodrama.

Bollywood movies are an acquired taste.  But with actors (performers) as fine as these and with the knowledge that the film is a wonderfully honest parody, HUMRAAZ is a great one for an introduction! In Hindi and English, with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, April 05",1114473600,4,2782,4.617886178861789
