7912656,4,B00000JLU5,I bought this on a film noir collection 10 years ago. Barbara Stanwick is incredible. Van Heflin is superb. Kirk Douglas is academy award class in this film.,1432339200,,157,4.642857142857143
7912657,1,B00000JLU5,"Rain and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers are two of the best movies I've ever seen. Director Lewis Milestone does an amazing job in both of them, their stars - Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Lizabeth Scott - are at their very best, the storylines are outstanding... BUT PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A DECENT COPY OF THESE MOVIES!!! THIS TAPE STINKS!!  It's missing more than 20 minutes of story in Rain, and you can't barely see Martha Ivers - the image quality is AWFUL!  Buy the restored version of Rain on DVD (complete and with WAY better image and sound quality) and some other copy of Martha Ivers - so you'll be able to fully appreciate these gems.",1072224000,5,676,4.487804878048781
