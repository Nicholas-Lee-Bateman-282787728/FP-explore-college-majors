8155137,5,B000K98666,Interesting DVD.  My family enjoyed watching it together.  The shopping trip to Chinatown was fun to watch.  We've made the chicken stir-fry and it turned out great!  It's good that the recipes are on the website so we can download it to use later.,1196812800,3,248,4.568181818181818
8155138,5,B000K98666,"My kids made us the whole meal featured in this DVD.  This is a great cooking show for kids -- nice to have kids showing how to do everything.  The Chinatown visit in this DVD is our favorite part.  This DVD left us wanting more!  We learned about this DVD through the producer's other DVDs, which are really meant for much younger kids.",1181260800,3,337,4.301587301587301
