8494861,5,B000KGGO8G,I am still in love with JenniferC.  What an AMAZING chest!!  Did she ever model or do picture posing after this?  Links would be appreciated.,1482019200,,141,4.56
8494862,5,B000KGGO8G,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which technically means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway!)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: Oopsies...I already had seen this ep. But it's excellent and I'm glad I now have it for my collection. This is one of those eps that a woman with a specific body issue, in this case someone like Jennifer with a large chest, can really watch and learn from. If S and C have said it once, they've said it 1,000 times - dress the widest part of you and then tailor down, and there are several great examples of that here. I also give kudos to Jennifer, who balked at the ambush, which certainly can be a tough thing for some women to deal with, but then realized that it would be a good experience. And also, after she had lost a lot of weight and said she didn't want to shop in a particular store, she relented and got some great stuff. She kept an open mind and toughed it out, and it's always nice to see hard work rewarded. Oh, and don't miss the absolutely priceless moment on shopping day 1.
3) However, I would be remiss if I didn't again mention the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.

SIDE NOTE TO AMAZON, TLC, AND DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
Please make Seasons 5, 6, and 7 available on DVD. Even at this price, I'd gladly buy them all.",1430611200,,1982,4.134715025906735
