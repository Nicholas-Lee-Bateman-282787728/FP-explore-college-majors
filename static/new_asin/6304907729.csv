941101,5,6304907729,"Woody Allen's Best Picture Winner is one of the funniest films I have seen in some time. I cant say this is his best, for I have not seen them all (or nearly enough) to compare. However I do sense a certain sense of zenith  achieved here with Allen's pictures. Woody Allen finds a charming insecure  girl (Diane Keaton) whom they hit it off really well in the beginning, then  begin to question their relationship. Played off really well with superb  dialogue, shot in a somewhat discontinuous style. Truly and deservedly a  classic by every standard. This DVD edition does not grant you with all the  niceties of others, unless you are settled with just a trailer, cause thats  all there is. Nonetheless, a great film for the whole family (excluding  young children).",945561600,,768,4.7218045112781954

Woody is  the king of american cinema, and this is his crown jewel.  If you have not  seen it, do so.  And if you are upset that it beat STAR WARS for best  picture at the oscars, get over it! This was a much better film.",944006400,,498,3.7211538461538463

So, ""Annie Hall"" is an excellent movie, that won 4 Oscars in '77, including Best Picture Award.  The DVD has no  extras, but the image is surprinsingly good, I could say excellent. Most  DVD adicts may not like the fact that the sound is mono, but DD or DTS  would not make a big difference for this kind of movie.

941104,5,6304907729,"I hope to never forget the feeling I had leaving the downtown theater in small town Rochester, Michigan after seeing this movie during it's first run in '77. My only experience w/ ""Woody Allen"" movies was seeing  ""Sleeper"" on CBS earlier. I think I was expecting a similarly  flavored excursion down slap-stick, sight-gag lane. Instead, my date and I  found ourselves floating down the sidewalks, trying to recall to each other  scenes that impacted us the most. We both knew we had experienced something  special, something that would hold us together like a bond through  time.
Today when I think of scenes that exemplify the film, I immediately  recall two narratives from Allen, one near the beginning, the other at the  end.
In the first, Woody is describing two older, Jewish Ladies  complaning about their food at a resort in the Catskills. ""Oh, the  food.... it was terrible!"" stated the one Lady. ""And such small  portions!"" cried the other. Woody used this as a comparison to life in  saying, ""It's cruel, maddening, frustrating...., and it's all over too  quickly!""
During the films final moments, Allen tells the joke about  a man in a Psychiatrist's office telling the Doctor about his Brother who  thinks he's a chicken. When the Doctor asks him if he's done anything to  correct his Brother, he said ""no."" When the Doctor asks why not,  the man answers, ""because I need the eggs.""  It seems that  regardless of how illogical and untrue ""true love"" often is, we  still feel the need to persue it.
Yea, life and love is a bitch, but  ain't it grand.",933033600,5,1562,4.753731343283582
941105,5,6304907729,"One of Woody Allen's best films.  Twenty-two years after it's initial release, ANNIE HALL remains one of the best romantic comedies of all time.  The plot is presented to us in a jigsaw mode, much like Orson Welle's  CITIZEN KANE.  First, we get the end of the story followed by the  beginning, the middle, things that happened between the beginning and the  middle, etc.
My favorite scene is when Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) visits  Annie (Diane Keaton) for the first time at her apartment.  While standing  on the balcony talking to each other, their personal thoughts are shared  with us via sub-titles.  How many times have all of us experienced this  situation?!
However, this is not just an excellent comedy but a film that  makes us realize the similarities that all of us go through during love  relationships and that true love is very fragile and precious.
The  screenplay was written by Woody and Marshall Brickman who has collaberated  several times with Mr. Allen including Manhattan (another ALLEN triumph),  Manhattan Murder Mystery (reuniting ALLEN with KEATON) and SLEEPER.
There  is a wonderful supporting cast. Tony Roberts is Alvy's macho best friend  who prefers Los Angeles to New York and Woody tells him the only cultural  advantage to living in L.A. is the ability to ""make a right turn on a  red light"" (this is still illegal in New York City).  Paul Simon plays  a record producer wooing Annie away from Alvy.  He tells Woody he moved to  L.A. because New York has gotten ""so dirty"".  Woody responds that  he's ""into garbage"".  Also look out for Carol Kane (one of  Woody's girlfriends before Annie), Christopher Walken (Annie's psycho  brother) and Jeff Goldblum.
ANNIE HALL is a wonderful film to add to your  collection.  Buy yourself a red light bulb and watch it with someone you  love.",918950400,5,1816,4.849180327868853

Very narrow audience appeal, and not really out loud laughing by viewers...more like a little smile occasionally. The talking to the camera was abused, repeatedly annoying.

941461,5,6304907729,"When the film was released I was in my early twenties. I liked it a lot when I first saw it. I like it even more now. I watch it every five years or so because its one of my all time favorites. The term classic is often overused, but *Annie Hall* deserves that moniker.

The film showcases Woody Allens enormous talent. It is a romantic comedy with lots of Allens psychological analysis of human behavior. No surprise there. Here its primarily about the ups and downs of romantic relationships, namely his own. This is a common theme for him, and *Annie Hall* represents the pinnacle of his artistry. Within the dramatic story there is his quirky style of comedy--and lots of it. This includes the meeting of the teamsters, the spider on the loose, the pontificating professor, the Los Angeles car accident(s), the sneeze, the ride to the airport with a young Christopher Walken, and many others. There are also clever vignettes depicting aspects of his childhood (another Allen favorite) along with a not so gentle parody of the 1970s west coast culture. Always witty, often hilarious, and sometimes sad, the storyline, the acting, and the direction are superb throughout.

One of my favorite scenes is Diane Keatons slow, sweet nightclub rendition of It Seems Like Old Times. Shes dressed in basic black and white, the lights are low, and for much of the song the camera is angled on her profile. She is magnificent in this film, and this mesmerizing scene will move even the hardest of hearts.

If youve never seen it, see it now. Youre in for a treat.",1438128000,,1555,4.688644688644689
941462,4,6304907729,"This movie is frequently referred to as something along the lines of  ""the very first movie showcasing Woody Allen's new, mature style.""

I've never seen it that way. When I think of The Wood Man's earlier movies (i.e., pre-Annie Hall), I think of poor lighting, poor editing, a certain amount of poor acting, uncreative camera angles, Allen talking to the camera, a considerable amount of slapstick comedy, a lack of quality structure, a lack of a coherent plot, too many silly throw-away jokes, an excessive amount of sexual jokes, and a lack of serious interludes. Unfortunately, many of these problems continued to exist with Annie Hall.

What sets Annie Hall somewhat apart from Allen's earlier films is the improvement in direction, lighting and acting, together with a somewhat more focused story. According to interviews given by Allen, his cinematographer Gordon Willis and his editor Ralph Rosenblum, none of these improvements would have come about without the massive contributions of Willis and Rosenblum (apparently with the exception of the improvement in acting).

There is much to say, of course, about the improvement in the quality of acting, which started with Annie Hall. For example, nothing that came before this would have prepared you for the improvement in Diane Keaton's performance. Nothing. Certainly not her acting in Allen's previous films, and definitely not her acting in the Godfather movies. And I don't even want to think about Keaton's occasional guest appearances in t.v. shows from the early 1970's (I am wincing right now, as I write this, thinking about a particular guest-starring appearance she made in an episode of Mannix). Let's face it, Keaton went from just about 0 to just about 100 with Annie Hall - she won the Academy Award for her performance in this, for Pete's sake.

At any rate, as far as I've always been concerned, The Wood Man's new, mature style did not come about, full-fledged, until his next film, Manhattan. Amongst other things, he almost completely dropped the silly throw-away jokes, quit over-doing the sexual jokes, tightened the film structure considerably, completely quit talking to the damn camera, and got quite a bit more serious. For me, Manhattan was his first fully satisfying film.

After that, his films just kept getting better and better. It took a while for him to make his first masterpiece, but he finally got there around six years later with The Purple Rose of Cairo.

Don't get me wrong, I like Annie Hall a lot, but as far as I'm concerned, Allen didn't hit the jackpot for the first time until Manhattan.",1438128000,,2595,5.006960556844548

941648,4,6304907729,"Annie Hall had a very interesting production. Woody first set out to make a surrealistic exploration called Anhedonia, a film chronicling the inner working of Alvy's mind. It was a sprawling, absurd, philosophical, murder-mystery/sci-fi/comedy which hinged strongly on stream-of-consciousness. The editor, Ralph Rosenblum, considered it a mess, and with Woody's guidance, carved out it's most engaging side plot: Alvy's relationship with Annie Hall. Taking this into account, it's a miracle that the film works (and is considered a masterpiece). The stream-of-consciousness/absurdist style was kept, but the tone was changed to that of a romantic comedy. This makes for a very interesting combination of sarcastic observational humor and innovative storytelling. That being said, it's not a perfect film, and at time it seems like Anhedonia is trying to take over the film but then another scene with Diane Keaton keeps it from going completely off the rails. Yes, it's self-indulgence, essentially Woody Allen psychoanalyzing himself for the public, but he's fully aware of it, we're fully aware of it, he gets to keep making movies and his audience is rewarded with entertaining and smart comedy. It's a wonder how Annie Hall is his most famous film to date though, as it seems like just another peg in his never-ending line of 90 minute witticisms. Nevertheless, it does have a number of his most memorable scenes, a fantastic cast, great photography, and a fast style.",1402358400,,1472,5.3218884120171674

I do like many other Jewish films very well, especially ""Enemies, A Love Story"" and ""The Chosen.""

In this film, Allen's origin as a standup comic are evident, and he seems to assume a primarily Jewish audience - so he should have called Annie a shiksa?!

His approach to cinematography was a psudo-Goddard experiment, with casual handling of the camera and uneven shifts of exposure levels that are jarring to 21st century eyes.

Some of the bits are very funny: the most famous visual gags, and his opening line at a political meeting.  But his pseuo-intellectual pretentiousness annoyed me, and I don't really care for his poses and his repetion of the cliche about not wanting to belong to a club (or woman) that would accept him.

The difference is Annie and Sally, besides the female mindset, are sort of different.  Annie was somewhat insecure in the beginning because her career was not established.  Sally knows what she's going after and was never in any way needing Harry's moral support in her career choice.

Woody Allen in New York in 2006. Annie Hall, his seventh film, introduces themes that would be featured in his later films, including Manhattan.

Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise of his relationship with Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that ""It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades,"" a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable.[35] By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately ""irrational and crazy and absurd"", but a necessity of life. wikipedia

941769,1,6304907729,"try as i might, i just can't convert myself to Woody Allen fan. i keep hearing him inexplicably listed in company with genuine comedy masters out of whom i admire the living daylights - The Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, Monty Python, Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker - so God knows i've tried, but it just won't take.
there's an appallingly simple reason for this. whatever talent, to say nothing of charm, Allen might have is effectively neutralized by the basic flaw in his formula: neurotics might be funny but WHINERS never are!!
""rom-coms"" always depend upon the likeability of the potential partners, and the fact is, likeability has never been Allen's strong suit. the principle reason his films have all the entertainment value of a math test is because his characters tend to have all the charm of Nazi Germany. quite frankly, Allen as a romantic lead is the anticlimax to end all anticlimaxes.
so towering is his lack of charm, in fact, that even the appealing Diane Keaton can't sweeten him. what was perhaps intended as a Dr. Watson Effect backfires: there, the more relatable Watson helps up realize that there are positive and admirable traits beyond the off-putting first impression that weirdo Sherlock Holmes always leaves. here, alas, the same technique only serves to taint existing good will toward Keaton, and we find ourselves wondering what's wrong with her that she'd put up with this weenie.
i guess you could argue that it was intended as a dark comedy, which would admittedly be more in line with the usual Woody Allen formula. but that thinking only exacerbates the film's irksomeness. the film may indeed of been designed to boil down to their parting of the ways, but said parting is so obvious from so far back that the notion adds a bludgeon-the-obvious quality. when the relationship finally does fold, you don't mourn for Allen nearly as much as you rejoice for Keaton!
all i can say is, you know a film is less than a masterpiece when it comes billed as a comedy and the most amusing thing in it is the misspelling of Christopher Walken (""Wlaken"") in the credits.
but i must admit there's a further issue, a reason to not simple dislike but positively resent this film. that it should get the Best Picture Oscar is surreal enough in it's own right, but if Star Wars had to lose, couldn't it at least lose to the sort of pretentious, artsy-farty ""prestige"" film that usually wins?
moreover, it's rare enough for a comedy film to win, so when that blue moon came around, why did it have to be a ""comedy"" that was only slightly funnier than Charles Manson's killing spree? with or without Star Wars in the equation, this is comparable to a Nobel Peace Prize for whoever invented the lobotomy!!

[NOTE: it's been a month or two since i wrote this review, and at the time i was sure it was my own original witticism. i've since found out, however, that the inventor of the lobotomy, one Gottleib Burkhart, did take home a Nobel. and yup, that's what he got it for!!

941770,5,6304907729,"There are movies known for their intense war scenes and eardrum-shattering action. Then there are movies that delve into a different area - into the ups and downs of a real life relationship. Annie Hall is subtle in its investigations, and you have to close up the laptop, put away the distractions, and really allow yourself to get swept away by this one to catch the numerous little things that are so true to life.

Allen and Keaton are both, in many ways, playing themselves. Allen adores New York, is a bit paranoid and self-conscious, and he falls for the sweetness of Keaton, who in her own way is just as lost. Their starting moments are as shy and nervous as many of us have encountered a few times in life. The subtitles are great, helping show the oh-so-common disconnect between the things we say and what we're really thinking.

No relationship goes smooth. They have the first kiss, the walks along the water, the break-ups, the fear of spiders, the meeting of the families. They run into racist family members, tough job situations, and along the way both of them grow and change. This isn't a stagnant relationship. The way they change is part of the joy here. We get to see them mature and broaden their horizons, sometimes with good results, sometimes with a step back.

My boyfriend's a born-and-bred New Yorker and he cringed when Keaton ordered the pastrami on white with mayo. There are just so many little touches like that, things that resonate with people who have lived and loved New York. There are brilliant angles on the LA culture - from Allen's point of view of course - including Jeff Goldblum sighing into the phone that he's ""forgotten his mantra"". What tragedy!

I do have to comment that is just staggering to me that this movie all about relationships - and who is supposedly featuring Annie Hall as the main character - only ONCE has two women talk directly to each other. And that's for about 2 seconds, when Annie's family is sharing the screen with Allen's family. Annie's mom asks Allen's mom what they do for the holidays and Allen's mom replies, ""we fast"". That's it!! The entire movie, and that's the only moment where two women talk with each other. Everything else is about Allen talking to various people around him. It goes to show how fully we as an audience have come to expect that women are the supporting cast to the men.

Still, a lot of great insights here, and a love story not only to Annie, but also to New York City.",1336176000,4,2476,4.5801354401805865

about romantic relationships ever made. Brilliantly written.
Brilliantly acted -- Diane Keaton is tremendous, the supporting cast is
full of gems and Allen himself takes the leap to present himself as a
real (if funny) human being and not a walking joke. And brilliantly
photographed by the great Gordon Willis of 'The Godfather' and many of
most important films of the 70s and 80s.

Wildly funny and ultimately heartbreaking. It's hard to imagine anyone
who has ever been in love, or struggled through grown-up relationships
NOT identifying with a lot of this film. I loved it in my late teens
when it first came out, and I love it even more 32 years later. Every
time I see it I notice different details, depending on my own current
life experiences. A film of enormous wit, humor, invention, and
understanding of the human heart. Its completely unique, playful and
idiosyncratic in style and approach, but that experimentation somehow
only makes it more accessible and universal. If you haven't seen it,
you owe yourself a try, even if you're not a Woody Allen 'fan'. And if
you saw it long ago, it may be time for another look.

For some insane reason, the US DVD is not enhanced for 16x9 TVs,
whereas the UK disc is, so if you have a region free player, and don't
want the blu-ray for some reason I recommend getting a copy of that.

non anamorphic US DVD).  Is this a reference quality disc that

941833,5,6304907729,"I have been a huge fan of Allen's works for years and I've seen every movie he's made. Strangely, Annie Hall, the most celebrated and universally considered THE Best Woody Allen's movie ever, did not belong to the top list of my favorite Allen's films. It took me three times to watch it and finally I can say yes, it is indeed a marvelous film, one of the best romantic stories told from the screen, the love story that could've only been made by Woody Allen. Its tag line says ""A nervous romance"", and they never came more nervous than Annie Hall. This is a story of two people who truly loved each their but could not stay together and moved on with their lives. Simple like that but it was told by Woody Allen, what made it not so simple and very enjoyable. This is the film where Diane Keaton had proved a perfect actress for Allen's movies. She brought to the film a lot of herself, her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role, even her dressing style that became hugely popular, and she was able to look at herself from the distance. She played Annie with such elegance, bemusement, perfect timing, and sense of humor, that for the whole time I kept asking myself how she did it. The part of the answer is that Allen understood her completely and masterfully used the originality of her persona to write and direct the character of Annie. Keaton recalls, ""Of course I recognized myself in the roles Woody Allen wrote. I mean, in Annie Hall (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.""

For Annie Hall, Allen received his first and only nomination for acting, and he deserved it. You may say that you've seen all his tricks many times but Annie Hall was the first movie where he mixed physical comedy, anxiety, and neurosis with the genuine feelings of love and nostalgia so touchingly and funny. Engaging the audience to the film by talking directly to them may not be used for the first time ever by Allen but it worked perfectly in Annie Hall. Who would forget the scene in the ticket booth in an art house movie cinema where Woody summons up Marshall McLuhan to silence a never stop talking self important movie critic? The flashbacks are smart and funny, the split screen Allen uses, really added to the characters' understanding by comparison two parallel streams of thought. Both, NYC and its antitheses, LA look gorgeous. Even the smallest cameos are memorable (Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, for example).

I think that the fascination and love that the film received upon its release had to do a lot with the fact that it was so different from everything Allen had done before Annie Hall. Checking the list of his earlier movies, one can't help noticing that they were pure slapstick comedies. The only earlier film that can be called Annie Hall's true predecessor is the one that Allen did not direct even though he wrote it, starred in it and for the first time shared the screen with Diane Keaton - Play it Again, Sam. I still believe that Allen has made films better than Annie Hall, at least I love 'Manhattan"", ""Hanna and Her Sisters', ""Zelig"", and especially ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" more and place them above Annie Hall. But as the first Allen's romantic dramedy, the one that had started the whole genre of independent and sophisticated urban love stories with an unusual, over self-involved and self-obsessed and not always likable lead hero who nevertheless is always ready to be the first to laugh at himself and to look at himself from the distance, Annie Hall has found the high place in the film history.

Critics have compared Annie Hall to Fellini's 8 1/2 but Woody responded in his typical way that ""it's more like my 2 1/2"".

Well, Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a quirky, neurotic comedian dealing with the failed relationship between himself and Miss. Annie Hall(Diane Keaton)

While still maintaining to be a non-stop laugh riot, Annie Hall is poignant and forever relevant thanks to the severity of these relationships quips and their seemingly 'straight-out-of-real-life' capability.

The first five minutes alone are pure genius, Alvy's monologue will never cease to amaze me.. viewing after viewing, after viewing...

""A relationship, I think, is like a shark. You know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.""

Annie Hall is a movie I for one, will never forget, never cease to admire, and will still manage to make me laugh.

Thanks Woody!",1242604800,,968,5.01875
941856,5,6304907729,"Annie Hall is Woody Allen's best film. This is Allen at his best: We get flawless, meaningful performances from a great cast and the plot moves along at a very good pace. The editing was wonderful. Although Woody Allen had to cut much from the original version of this film, he cut well and we get a motion picture with practically nothing left to remove. What's more, there's so much comedy in this film it stands out as one of the best comedies I've ever seen. The cinematography is very well done and the choreography works best in crowd scenes and the scenes on the streets of Manhattan.

When the action starts, we meet twice divorced Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) who pals around with his friend Rob (Tony Roberts). Alvy comes from a dysfunctional family that literally lived under the roller coaster at Coney Island; and he hasn't stopped shaking and being neurotic since his childhood. One day Alvy, Rob and a couple of women gather to play indoor tennis--and Alvy meets Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). It isn't long, either, before Alvy and Annie strike up a pretty hot romance despite a few awkward moments in their very first conversations.

As time passes, Alvy and Annie have a lot of experiences--some good, some bad; but they stay together through it. Alvy tries to get Annie to ""broaden her horizons"" with books that he buys for her and his encouragement for her to take continuing education courses at New York University. Annie and Alvy also enjoy a pretty good romantic life.

But things change over time. Annie grows but Alvy essentially stays the same. Annie wants to move to Los Angeles where she thinks she can record music along with Tony Lacey (Paul Simon); but Alvy wants to stay in New York. Alvy can't stand California in general and he especially hates Los Angeles.

The plot can go anywhere from here. Annie also sings and dabbles in photography--will this affect their relationship? Will Alvy move out to California to continue his relationship with Annie? What about Tony Lacey--he seems to be attracted to Annie. Will Tony come between Alvy and Annie? Watch and find out!

I must say that Woody Allen uses some pretty incredible techniques to show how people can see others. At one point, Alvy images that he appears to be a Hasidic Jew in the eyes of the anti-Semitic ""Grammy Hall"" (Helen Ludlam). At another point, Allen has Alvy, Annie and Rob looking on at a party given many years prior for a family member back in Brooklyn; and it's fascinating to see the characters in the present react to the party so many years prior.

Annie Hall will always be a timeless love story with so much comedy you'll practically roll over on the floor with laughter. Obviously, this film is a ""must-have"" for fans of the actors in this film; and Woody Allen fans could never have a complete collection of his work unless they have this film.

It is interesting that they can take an old flick like Casablanca and up grade it to a beautiful, sharp Blu ray version (albeit still a B/W standard screen), and then take another, so popular classic like Annie Hall, put it in a fancy package and even provide both the widescreen and full screen versions on the same disc, and yet both having such a grainy picture!  I have a Sony 52"" XBR6 HDTV that ALL DVD's look terrific on.  I realize that this Annie Hall DVD was not recorded on Blu Ray, and that my home made DVD recording which looks so much smoother and sharper was recorded from an HDTV (1080i) channel.  But, although I have other Woody Allen movies also bought directly from Amazon, they look just fine even though recorded on SD.  I'm really disappointed about this one and will probably just keep the home-made and toss the other, since I can't return an opened DVD.

So I don't recommend this DVD.  I like the movie.  Will foolishly hope I can buy a better recordng eventually.

Update much later:  The Blu-Ray version is grainy, too, as others have also commented, as the original filming caused this.  Too bad.",1235865600,2,1263,5.057971014492754
941860,2,6304907729,"I'd recently seen my first Woody Allen flick, and decided to follow it up with this critically-acclaimed award winner. My wife and I got about three-fourths of the way through it before turning off the TV. We just couldn't listen to the miserable talking heads any longer.

The previous film we watched was directed by Allen, but he did not act in it. In Annie Hall, he plays the lead actor, and basically subjects the viewer to an endless barrage of complaining and bad sense of style and taste. Diane Keaton plays Annie, who despite the forced concept that she's articulate, intelligent and well-rounded she presents herself as often aloof and simple.

The whole movie is just talking heads. Talking, talking, and more talking. The dated style of the seventies took us by surprise - all the men in this film appear to be slobs in cheap suits with careless looking hair (as noted by my wife with my agreement).

The premise I suppose is that Woody Allen is cute in some way, and attractive too. But as my wife pointed out, he's a ""nebbish"" (a nerd), and it just felt so fake. I'd say about half of the injected jokes were far from funny. Its also fun to note that in the movie poster Allen appears taller than his girl, but in the film he walks quite shorter.
As a reality check, this film was watched by two thirty year-olds in the year 2009, and the story is about a forty-something guy in the year 1975 (I believe), so we weren't quite born when this film was considered Best Movie Of The Year. Not this year.

My interest in Woody Allen films has now been downgraded to films he does not appear in. I don't think I could bear to hear his voice again, at least not in a starring role.",1234656000,,1688,4.4006410256410255

Anyway, I've seen some of Woody Allen's other movies and, though I like some of them, ""Annie Hall"" is my favorite.

I heard Mr. Allen say that he was not happy with this film.  I think he thinks that to make a great film it has to be ""serious.""  Annie Hall touches on a lot of elements.  It is serious in a way with regard to relationships.

Allen has done a wonderful job directing this movie with a light touch.

Diane Keaton was just adorable and I think it was the very best role she has ever gotten.  As an actor, Allen plays himself but he doesn't make any bones about it.  He is believable.

The cinematography by Gordon Willis is superb",1231286400,,800,4.0576923076923075
941862,2,6304907729,"After watching a few of Woody Allen's films this is the one I found the most accomplished, interesting and funny other than ""Take The Money and Run"".  ""Sleeper"" really lives up (or should I say down) to its name and after that I didn't think I'd risk another Allen flick until I watched this one.  Allen plays the neurotic romantic self-sabotager role very well and watching his attempts at getting the ultimate chalk and cheese relationship to work was amusing for the most part and hilarious in a few of the scenes that actually managed to age pretty well over the last 30 years.

The only beef I have with this dvd version of the film is that the picture quality is very poor with numerous imperfections throughout such as black circles, spots etc on many frames and the very poor sound quality which comes in mono.  Thankfully, in a film like this where sound effects matter little and it's the dialogue that makes this one great, one's overall enjoyment isn't diminished too much but if they are thinking of doing a Director's Cut of this film or if they are looking at putting this on Blu-ray, they should take the opportunity to clean up both the picture and the sound quality with a 5.1 surround sound option as well as with good Special Features to boot.

Overall this is Woody Allen at his best in a film that only he could make and I actually enjoyed it a great deal but you should wait until they release a better dvd version in either standard or Blu-ray formats but with better Special Features and much, much better picture and sound quality options preferably in a new Director's Cut.",1229817600,2,1600,4.541666666666667

941918,5,6304907729,"While Woody Allen had a large, devoted cult following which began around the mid-sixties, it wasn't until the release of the highly acclaimed, academy award winning  `Annie Hall' in '77 that the rest of the world finally caught up with this comic giant and brought his cutting edge cinematic style into the mainstream. His self-analytical persona was perfect for the growingly narcissistic American public and the way he introduced the audience into the storyline of his films by intermittently turning towards the screen as though it were a person and engaging the viewer with questions and comments was nothing short of pure genius (The legendary Bob Hope made use of this active audience participation technique years earlier but not to the extent and effectiveness as Woody).

While my particular favorite Woody Allen film happens to be `Love and Death released in '75, I can see why `Annie Hall' is by-in-large the film most people will point to as his apex in filmmaking. It really is the ultimate American comedy containing all the 20th century angst his name as become synonymous with; fear of failure, fear of success, fear of relationships, fear of being alone, fear of an ever-expanding universe. We find ourselves in his insecurities and his self-loathing in such classic statements as, `I just don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member"". We've all been there at one time or another in life. That's what makes it so hilarious.

941921,5,6304907729,"Hailed as Woody Allen's finest film, `Annie Hall' has some pretty weighty expectations to live up to, and what amazes me is that each and every time I watch it I am reminded of why Allen is loved to much among the cinemaphiles like myself.  Now I admit to not having seen much Allen, and I admit that the first time I saw `Annie Hall' I shut it off about ten minutes in because I couldn't get into it.  I was put off by Allen's style of storytelling.  Then I saw some of Allen's more recent work, like `Match Point' and the ever brilliant `Hannah and Her Sisters' (I know, not really recent) and I was prompted to give `Annie Hall' another try.  I found that the opening didn't put me off as much as I remembered and soon I was completely engrossed in the film.

I seriously couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

I can't for the life of me decide which film I truly prefer (`Annie Hall' or `Hannah and Her Sisters') but fact remains that both films are cinematic gems.  Once one grows accustomed to Allen's flare for storytelling you become a part of his story, as if you were hearing each word from a dear friend.  Sure, the delivery is sporadic and spontaneous and at times it throws you off, but that's the kind of friend Woody Allen is; he's kind of crazy, but in a good way.

The film tells the story of comedian Alvy Singer who falls in love with Annie Hall, a ditzy yet tantalizing young woman.  The film really just tells us of their relationship; the good and bad times, the fights and intimacies and really fleshes out these two people right before our eyes.

What I think is so poignant about `Annie Hall' is that it depicts a relationship that is as average as they come and so any and everyone can relate and draw from this film.  The audience can immediately place themselves in the film and understand both Singer and Hall and this helps the audience make a personal and emotional connection to the material; thus causing us to care deeply about the outcome.  The film beautifully captures the strains that insecurities and difference can cause on a relationship and approaches the subjects of independence and desire with precision and grace.

The film is only elevated by the brilliant performances by the two leads.  Keaton, who rightfully won the Oscar for her performance, is exciting and mysterious, intriguing and complex.  Her character is desirous from the very beginning and she builds on her intricacies magnificently.  Allen is a revelation, and in all honesty my favorite part of the film.  His neurotic shtick can get a little tiresome (as was seen in `Scoop') but here he is genuine and passionate with his delivery, to the point where he is not only tolerable but wholly enjoyable.

`Annie Hall' has already received classic status and will always be regarded as one of the finest films of all time.  I'm here to simply agree and urge anyone who has yet to see the film to check it out ASAP.  Coming from a man who was once put off by the auteur that is Woody Allen, this is truly an astounding film.

As for the rest, it's pretty much garbage. Woody Allen is so disgusting to even look at, never mind listen to, that the movie is almost impossible to endure. I know he's only a memory these days, but how did the world tolerate him in his prime? How did he become a success? I understand that New York and LA are full of his kind of people, but did he really have an audience in the rest of the country? If so, I think it must have been made up of Middle American poseurs who wanted to be seen as superior intellects because they were fans of the ""smart"" Jewish comic from New York: ""Har har har- Woody Allen just referenced the Oedipus Complex in his joke. I understand that reference, so I must be smart too! Har har, do_you_get it?"". This is the first Woody Allen movie I've ever seen, and I think it will be the last.

So I figured I'd give it a shot and see if I've just been missing something all these years. I haven't.

Here he adds a flourish by contrasting old New York (in the 1970's) to up and coming California as the cultural mecca of the American empire. And, as should be the case, New York wins.

Add to that the perennial issue of Woody's struggle with `interpersonal' relationships and his angst-driven desire to understand the modern world and you have a very fine social commentary of the times. Needless to say Woody's love interest Annie Hall (as played by his then paramour Diane Keaton) keeps him hopping. As does an ensemble cast that works well together as foils for his ironic and savage humor. The only surprise in revisiting this film recently is how well Keaton played her role as an up and coming torch singer. Of course, I have always been a sucker for torch singers but that is another matter. Some of the humor may seem dated and very 1970's New Yorkish. Some of Woody's mannerisms and use of sight gags may seem like old news. But this is a film to watch or re-watch if you have seen it before.",1185667200,,1479,4.581132075471698

941999,5,6304907729,"This is the first Woody Allen film (1977) to be more than just an outright wacky comedy, because although this has great comedy moments throughout, it also has a lot to say about relationships.

Allen plays a successful stand-up comedian Alvy Singer, who falls in love with night club singer the Annie Hall of the title. The few stand-up scenes are great, because ten years earlier Woody Allen was a stand-up comedian and he makes it seem so natural.

""I...interestingly had, uh, dated...a woman in the Eisenhower Administration...briefly...and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh ... tsch ... 'cause I was trying to do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years""

Surreal moments occur in which little frustrations of Allens's come out. Such as when waiting in the queue at the cinema. A man is giving his slightly pretentious opinion to his girlfriend about Marshall McLuhan, and rather loudly. Alvy gets annoyed and introduces the man to Marshall McLuhan who promptly tells the man ""you know nothing of my work...."".

In perhaps the most famous scene in the film Alvy and Annie go back to her apartment and standing on the balcony they talk awkardly. We hear them talk but see what they are think in subtitles:

Alvy: Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emereged yet. (subtitled - I wonder what she looks like naked?)

In many ways this is Woody Allens perfect film. It still has a huge comedic element to it, but under the comedy there are some serious points made. Overall I probably would choose Manhattan over this, but whilst Manhattan is cinematically a greater film, crucially it probably isn't as entertaining. You should own both!",1185148800,,1760,4.811258278145695
942000,5,6304907729,"One of the great modern love stories, the charming ""Annie Hall"" has Allen essentially playing himself, with Keaton's sweet, spacy Annie providing an inspired foil. Aside from its examination of contemporary relationships, the movie hilariously contrasts the flavor and essence of New York with sunny, hip Los Angeles, that sprawl on the West Coast which, to Allen's mind, is definitely alien territory. Touching, true, and extremely funny, this is Woody's peak.",1183420800,,461,5.507042253521127
942001,4,6304907729,"This film marks the pinnacle of Woody's career, introducing the main themes later rehearsed to death in subsequent projects. A self-conscious neurotic quippy self-flagellating Jewish comedian meets a juicy self-conscious WASP, wooing her, rejecting her and after being rejected himself longing for a life that could have been. There is always an aura of sadness about Allen's films - a sadness of masculinity longed for and never realized, of self-contempt burning in someone who knows he can't ever escape the intellectual mindtrap that epitomizes the 'New Yorker' crowd. While Allen appears to despise the greed, snobbery and pretentiousness of this crowd, he always seems paralyzed and unable to find his way out of the mousetrap.

Annie Hall is a genuinely funny and profound film. Alvyn knows the New Yorker crowd lacks something that would fulfill his longing. He knows that 'Annie' represents  his one chance to escape the straightjacket of empty intellectual poseurism.  The self-revelatory autobiographical element are bittersweet as the viewer becomes all too aware that Alvyn fails the challenge of his life. the very character trait that makes him funny makes him incapable of being able to hold, endure and accept Annie for who she is . The film is, for me, a lesson showing how not to be a man.  A demonstration of the consequences of not being able to love fully, of being unable to disappear into surrender.

Both Keaton and Allen do a fantastic acting job basically playing themselves. While Allen never surpasses the quirkines, the bittersweet lightness of the Annie Hall's Alvyn character, Keaton's best moments come  in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" made in the same year.",1182988800,,1688,5.164835164835165

Taking place, of course, in New York City, Allen's nearly autobiographical alter ego, Alvy Singer, has an on-again, off-again romance with the titled character (Diane Keaton) who is his soul mate and counterpart to his own labored existence.  Episodic for sure, Allen's directing and co-writing take everything bothersome and makes it into an honest labor of love.  (Alvy, too, is a stand-up comic who spars about anything from strained love relationships to Republican politics.  Not to mention both have that eloquent obssession with ""sex and death"".)  While Alvy always seems maladjusted, he is unable to cope without Annie who, while from Chippewa Falls, WI, can relate to him and help him through the shipwreck of his nuerotic life.

'Annie Hall' is exceptionally funny.  In one scene Annie is relating a dream to Alvy where ""Frank Sinatra is suffocating"" her.  Alvy, quick to psychoanalysis, immediately says that she is suffocating her career as a singer.  She counters that her therapist says that it is he who is suffocating her because his last name in Singer.  (And by all means psychology gets a comedic thrashing many times.)  While thinking aloud on the street, Alvy stops a couple to ask them roughly why they seemed so happy.  ""Basically, I'm shallow,"" she confides.  ""I'm basically shallow, too,"" he adds.  In another scene he talks to his friend (Tony Roberts), where he relates talking to a dinner guest.  He talks about the meal and tells of a companion who said, ""I had salad.  Didjyou?""  To which they both debate anti-semitism.  Similarly, he's great at showing what it's like to be scrutinized as a dinner guest.  There's also a split-screen scene where Alvie and Annie are each talking to their pyschiatrists and the differences are acutely funny.  (One should also add that Allen did more in these few minutes than 'Conversations with Other Women' did in a whole movie.)  Pet peeves are also confronted to provide creator and audience with plenty of therapeutic laughs.

'Annie Hall' is just delightful fun.  Chockful of wit and candor, it is a sustaining comedic classic. (Also with cameo appearances by Shelley Duvall as a 'Rolling Stone' reporter and Paul Simon.)",1182038400,,2900,5.968523002421308

Allen's character, a neurotic standup comic named Alvy Singer, meets free-spirited Annie Hall (played with superb wit and energy by a young Diane Keaton). Their on-again-off-again romance flows throughout the movie leading both of them on a roller coaster of emotions that they both want to stay on and get off of at the same time.

Annie Hall features cameos from several of today's stars, although when Annie Hall was filmed these actors were just dayplayers. It's a veritable who's-who of small parts. Jeff Goldblum as a party guest, Sigourney Weaver as one of Alvy's dates, Beverly D'Angelo as a character in a TV show, Truman Capote as a Truman Capote lookalike, and Christopher Walken as Annie's slightly off-kilter brother. Paul Simon also makes an extended appearance as musician Tony Lacey.

942005,5,6304907729,"Annie Hall falls at a crucial juncture of Woody Allen's career - when he was switching from the laugh a minute, slapstick routines of his early films such as 'Take the Money and Run' and 'Bananas' to the more sombre, philosophical treatments of his later works. This film captures the best of both worlds. As a result, I think it is Woody Allen's finest.

From the off, the jokes are teriffic: the movie opens with a typically emotionally fraught Allen addressing the camera direct: 'There's this joke, two Jewish women at a Catskill mountain resort having dinner - one says 'the food here's terrible,' the other says, 'yeah, and such small portions' - and that sums up my view on life'. Annie Hall is Woody Allen's finest diagnosis on love and life. Annie is an endearing character in her men's shirts and ties, the grass smoking temptress who unwittingly draws the intellectually fraught Alvie Singer (Allen )into her seemingly innocent web - 'What, did you live in a Norman Rockwell painting or something?'. The couple poke fun at New York Intellectuals: 'Samuel Beckett - he just doesn't hit me at a gut level' - 'I'd like to hit him at a gut level'. And the transient curve of modern sexual relationships. The intellectual angst of New York against the Hollywood vapid glamour of LA and the West coast. It is a fine movie, packed with many jokes and superb life observations.

942111,4,6304907729,"Let's get the criticism out of the way first.  The script of a self-indulgent, Brooklyn, Bergman wanna-be massaging his Liberalism to advantage, is pseudo-intellectual air.  Woody's humor, the Jewish Complaint, is stale now.  We thought it was so funny back in the 60's and 70's.  We gave this schlemiel, a Jewish version of Waspy, Bob Hope, a free pass for thirty years.  After all the lint has been flicked from the navel, what we have is a dopey looking ethnic with delusions about the prom queen.  But then again - don't we all and there's the appeal.

In 1977, Allen pasted some of the quirky techniques of European directors such as Bergman, Godard, or Fellini, and grafted an American style romance of the 1930's variety. There's an element of screwball such as Clark Gable's It Happened One Night or Cary Grant's, Front Page. Anyhow, mix in a little mild counterculture style, dope smoking, coke sniffing, and bed jumping and you get a pastiche of Post-Vietnam Modernism. Reflecting the new feminism: there's no questioning Annie's morals.  She's a single woman that sleeps with her boyfriends.  It's a given, but back in the Eisenhower years, oh, the angst, hide the children!  Reliable birth control had triumphed.

Allen is the first nerd to make it big in the Post-Nam years. He has made it possible for all the Saturday Night comediennes and bad boy, barf in your face, humorists that came after.  For that reason, Allen is an important, pivotal figure culturally. He has solidified Borst Belt comedy with pseudo-intellectual patter.

The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can't really get a grip on love. He's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI's Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they're not good, it's just that they don't really pick by what's the funniest film ever. Example, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.

942118,5,6304907729,"It's great to see how timeless this 1977 movie still is after nearly thirty years especially after seeing Woody Allen's more challenging later work in the interim. But nothing beats a perfectly written script (courtesy of Allen and frequent collaborator Marshall Brickman) and the undeniable chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton in the title role. Scene for scene, it represents the most consistently engaging comedy Allen ever directed, and his wonderfully creative stream-of-consciousness narrative is filled to the brim with detours into flashbacks, animation, split-screens, fantasy scenes and speaking to the camera. It all blends into a movie that remains emotionally resonant and even bittersweet behind all the laughs.

There is little plot to speak of as it focuses on the evolving relationship between Alvy Singer, a successful stand-up comedian, and Annie Hall, an aspiring singer. Interspersed throughout are episodes in Alvy's angst-driven life - his shaky childhood next to the Coney Island rollercoaster, his desultory days as a comedy writer, his previous failures in relationships and marriages, his ongoing resistance to the West Coast. No longer playing just the romantic loser of ""Play It Again, Sam"", Allen is constantly kvetching in his search for intellectual fulfillment but finally finds his first true love in his diametric opposite, an unaffected, self-deprecating girl from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Their relationship is played out in clever episodes, none more so than their first meeting at a tennis game followed by Annie's reckless driving and a subtitled conversation on her terrace. It is really the contrast in their approach to life that brings them together and provides the impetus for their dissolution.

Whether she is playing herself or not, Keaton is an unadulterated joy even as her character sadly grows apart from Alvy. Allen is himself or at least his public persona and even manages a sense of unexpected pathos toward the end, especially when he desperately proposes marriage at the health food restaurant. There are so many memorable moments that it's difficult to choose a favorite - Marshall McLuhan at the movies, the lobsters, the sneeze into the cocaine, Christopher Walken's bit as Annie's headlight-obsessed brother Duane. A movie as perfect as this deserves a deluxe DVD treatment, but the 2000 release has simply a decent print transfer and unfortunately only the original trailer as an extra.

His renditions of New York, Los Angeles, the dating scene, and popular culture are still relevant and comedic.  And kudos to Allen for having the freshness to ask candid questions to people on the street, pull a real-life personality from offscreen, and bicker with the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Allen may be guilty of reshuffling the same deck of observations and philosophies throughout all of his movies, but in this and other gems (Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Deconstructing Harry), we see why he's such a big deal.

This is Allen's best, funniest, most honest movie and for me, the high-point in his movie making career. The earlier films such as Bananas, Take the Money and Run and Sleeper, were really funny movies and can be enjoyed for exactly what they are - light comedies. Annie Hall is different. It's Woody Allen telling the world what it's like to be him, in New York, perpetually alone in a crowd or at best, half-a-step out of pace with society. And he almost convinces you that it's the world, not him that needs to catch up. Despite the title, Woody is the main character and Annie, played to air-head perfection by Diane Keaton, shares the second spot with the greatest ""extra"" in the world - NYC; possibly Allen's real true love.

The plot is simple - a love story about mis-matched people trying hard to find happiness in a crazy world. But the wonderful acting and sharp dialogue turn what could have been a nice little movie into a memorable classic.

Don't expect to ""get it"" if you don't pay attention. The interplay among the characters, the dripping New York sarcasm (LA takes a well-deserved beating at the hands of Allen's character) and the shots he takes at a few of his fellow New Yorkers (the scene at the movie theater is priceless) require that you listen to the dialogue. Again, this is Allen at his best, which is saying a lot.

While I think his reputation and image have been tarnished by some of the disturbing facts in his personal life, movies are all about escapism. And there is no better way to escape, for me, than by watching a smart, well written comedy.  Annie Hall qualifies - 5 stars.",1129939200,3,1734,4.5303514376996805

942197,5,6304907729,"`Annie Hall', directed by Woody Allen and written by Allen and Marshall Brickman is eminently rewatchable, which is the one quality that makes it an excellent DVD purchase. I have seen this movie at least a half dozen times, and I am still discovering interesting things in the film. What makes this so odd to me is that the first time I saw it, after having seen `Manhattan', I really did not think it was as good as the later film.

My initially low opinion of the movie was primarily due to the numerous cinematic gimmicks harking back to his earlier, plainly less thoughtful movies. These include flashbacks to dopey teachers and classmates, almost as a parody of Jean Shepherd; subtitles showing what the characters are really thinking of one another during a conversation; a cartoon segment where Allen and the Tony Roberts character appear with the wicked witch from Snow White; speeches to the audience; and the most famous, a surprise appearance by Marshall McCluhan in a movie theatre lobby to refute a college instructor pontificating about McCluhan's ideas.

The single most famous scene from the movie is the encounter between Allen's character, Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, played brilliantly by Diane Keaton, after their tennis match with Annie dressed in her classic layered look with vest, men's tie, and balloonish trousers. The great sound bite from this encounter is the Annie Hall exclamation `La Di Dah, La Di Dah, Dah Dah...' and Singer's reaction wondering how he could be interested in anyone making such silly exclamations. From this one scene came a whole late 1970's fashion trend, the `Annie Hall' look of layered, mannish clothes. This scene also sets the stage for my latest insight into the movie, which is the progression of Annie, with a lot of help from Alvy, from an unserious girl with a decent singing voice to a serious woman with a few good ideas and a connection to a serious Hollywood music personality, played convincingly by Paul Simon with an eye to having her performances commercially recorded.

While so much can be said of the loves, frustrations, and disappointments of Alvy Singer, the movie is, after all, named `Annie Hall', not `Alvy Singer'. Not to say that this incarnation of the Woody Allen fictional persona is not central to the story. In the story of Alvy Singer that frames our encounter with Annie, there are encounters with two early marriages to characters played by Carol Kane and Janet Margolin, plus less than exciting romantic encounters with Shelley Duvall. The Allen talent for pulling in major actors and future major actors for brief appearances is in full bloom. There are excellent little parts for Colleen Dewhurst and Christopher Walken. There are even smaller parts for surprise appearances by Jeff Goldblum, Sigourney Weaver, and Beverly De'Angelis. Just as Allen is playing his usual, highly autobiographical character, male costar Tony Roberts plays the typically untroubled successful male who is constantly on the make for something or other, whether it be a business deal of a romantic laision. (It just occurred to me that it is logical that Roberts did not play the male costar in `Manhattan', as the Michael Murphy character simply did not fit the typical Tony Roberts character as it appears in `Play It Again, Sam', `A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy', and `Annie Hall'.

While I have not reviewed all of Allen's later movies, I will venture the opinion that not only is `Annie Hall' better than all the films which precede it, it is as good or better than his best later movies (such as `Hannah and Her Sisters', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', and `Husbands and Wives'), if only because it is so effective a mix of both character study and humor. Some of Allen's jokes from this movie are some of his best known. In fact, I get the same sense watching this movie as I do when I see `Hamlet'. So many lines sound like clichs because they have been so widely quoted.

There are a lot of things which could be said about this movie which are really about themes which run through almost all of Allen's films such as doting on sexuality, phony intellectuality, love of Manhattan, and death. One clever riff on death is when Annie is moving into Alvy's apartment, Alvy discovers a book of Sylvia Plath's poems, which contradicts Hall's later statement when she is moving out that all the books about death were given to her by Singer. (Plath was a famously depressive poet who committed suicide in mid-career).

Allen's movie DVDs are uniformly free of fancy extras such as commentary tracks and `Making of' documentaries, and this is no exception. At the risk of repeating myself, I will say that the singular attraction of Allen's body of work in general and `Annie Hall' in particular is its rewatchability. As unrealistic as the many cinematic gimmicks are, the characters are intensely real. They are people with which we can sincerely associate. Try that with your usual Ben Stiller character.

Highly recommended classic among both Allen movies and all movies in general.",1114387200,49,5055,4.905263157894737

942200,5,6304907729,"Woody Allen transitioned from a very funny writer/actor/director, to a truly brilliant filmmaker with ""Annie Hall."" I saw this landmark movie again and was amazed at how well it holds up over time, and how pristine the film looks on DVD. Like Allen's earlier works, this is hilariously funny, but beneath the humor lies a poignant love story of two mismatched, neurotic people. It is a focused film that takes a mature look at modern urban relationships. The witty, clever screenplay is one of the reasons for its enduring popularity, regardless of the audience's demographics.

Alvy Singer, (Woody Allen), is a pessimistic, insecure, angst-ridden, short, Jewish New Yorker, originally from Brooklyn, just like Mr. Allen. Obviously, there are autobiographical elements here. Singer used to be a gag writer for comedians, but made a career decision to do his own comic stand-up routine. When we meet him for the first time, he has already become a star...and is still very neurotic. ""Life is full of loneliness, misery, suffering, and unhappiness - and it's all over much too quickly,"" he says. Singer has a spurt of good luck, however, when he meets ditsy, charming Annie Hall, originally from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Diane Keaton is outstanding in the role - she won an Academy Award for Best Actress, and began a funky clothes trend with her wardrobe that lasted for a few years. If Alvy is New York seeded rye bread, then Annie is a somewhat tightly-wound, Wonder Bread WASP. She actually orders a pastrami sandwich on white bread with mayo in a local deli - that's like ordering fettuccine with ketchup in an Italian trattoria. It's a wonder that when the two have their first conversation they don't go into instant culture shock. Alvy may have poor self esteem, but Annie sure does like him. They appear to be having a wonderful time together too, as in the scene where they chase live lobsters around the kitchen floor, trying to cook a seafood dinner. Alvy's anhedonia, (the inability to enjoy oneself), seems to abandon him temporarily as the romance flourishes.

""Annie Hall"" gets much of its comedy from mundane, everyday occurrences. I actually wonder if Jerry Seinfeld didn't derive some inspiration for his hit sitcom from Allen's film. One of the more brilliant scenes occurs when Singer goes to Annie's apartment, for the first time, right after they meet, for a drink and some getting-to-know-you conversation. As they make small talk, sub-titles appear on the screen, stating what the two are actually thinking: Alvy: ""I wonder what she looks like naked,"" Annie: ""He's too smart for me; hang in there."" There is also an outrageous split screen sequence of Annie and Alvie in therapy sessions, with their respective shrinks, discussing their relationship. His therapist asks if they have sex often, hers asks the same. He replies, ""Hardly ever! Maybe three times a week."" Annie responds, ""Constantly! I'd say three times a week."" Also fantastic are the wacky sequences with Annie's Midwestern family, (Colleen Dewhurst is wonderful as Annie's mother, and Christopher Walken, her spooky brother, is beyond weird). Singer comments on how different his Brooklyn family is from her Midwestern relations. Then the screen splits and we see Annie's family talking quietly over dinner, while Alvy's boisterous family, bicker over their Passover meal. As the romance progresses, Alvy's previous relationships with wives numbers 1 and 2 are depicted through a series of flashbacks.

There are problems and rough spots, as with most relationships. Alvy keeps trying to turn Annie into the woman he wants her to be. When he pushes her to go back to college and take some classes, she gains new confidence - and develops a crush on one of her professors. The plot thickens when Annie meets a hit record producer who offers her a job in Los Angeles. Alvy goes along, temporarily, to do a TV special. One of Woody Allen's pet peeves is California, and life on the left coast, as compared to life in NYC, so you can bet there is plenty of scathing commentary about Hollywood. Although many know how Annie and Alvy wind up, I won't spoil it for those who don't. However, if you have not seen ""Annie Hall,"" you are really missing something phenomenal. And if you have seen it, and don't have it in your DVD collection, you might want to reconsider.

The film is done in non-linear form, and Allen's use of split screens techniques, animated characters, direct-to-camera narration, and occasional subtitles, are extremely effective, creative and innovative. Allen won Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Actor for ""Annie Hall."" There are cameos by: Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Carol Kane, Janet Margolin, Marshall MacLuhan, Dick Cavet, John Glover, Jeff Goldblum, Beverly D'Angelo and Sigourney Weaver.

So what is the point of this fabulous movie, besides lots of laughs and terrific acting? Well, Groucho Marx used to say, ""I'd never belong to a club that would have someone like me as a member."" The primary message here is that to be loved, one has to love oneself first. Of course Woody Allen is also saying that love is annoying and pointless, as are relationships in general - but we need them.

942202,4,6304907729,"ANNIE HALL is often considered Woody Allen's masterpiece. Certainly, it is one of his most personal and touching films, a seriocomic meditation on...well, love, basically. Love and the search for relationships. Alvy Singer, the character Allen plays in this film, is always on the lookout for a relationship, but something always seems to get in the way of true happiness with a woman for him---and (I hope I'm not spoiling anything for anyone by saying this), his central relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in this film is no exception.

Let me say right off that I thought this film was often fun to watch. Dialogue of such sharp comic wit and intelligence as Allen writes here is always something to be treasured (although sometimes he can be a bit too witty and referential for his own good, leaving some of his audience in the dark), the performances are equally spot-on (Allen's especially), and the filmmaking style is fascinating and sometimes exhilarating. This is hardly your usual romantic comedy with a linear plot. Allen plays with the time order of events (you immediately find out about Alvy and Annie's breakup at the beginning), throws in surreal flashbacks to his childhood, and even has his character speak directly to the camera at certain points. But never does any of it seem to be film trickery for its own sake; Allen seems to use this style more searchingly. He himself seems to be trying to find out the reasons why love can hurt so much.

ANNIE HALL is not a perfect film. Maybe it would have been better if Alvy Singer's story had been told in a slightly more linear style; the film seems a bit more of a jumbled mess in its final form, and its seeming lack of a plot structure at times distracted me (since I couldn't quite figure out the reason for it). And perhaps Allen could have developed Annie Hall's character a little more than he did; as brilliantly as Diane Keaton played her (and she won an Oscar for this performance, as did the film itself), she always remained more a set of personality quirks and attitudes than an actual flesh-and-blood character. (But then, perhaps that's the whole point; maybe that's the way Alvy sees her, and maybe that's partly why he, in the end, loses her).

Still, ANNIE HALL is overall a good film, one that is a lot more mature and perceptive about love and relationships than a lot of the romantic comedies I've seen in recent times (as entertaining as some of them may be). For its laughs as well as its depth, it is worth seeing, and maybe even worth reflecting after the humor of Woody Allen's neuroses has worn off and the bittersweet poignancy of its ending remains.

942204,5,6304907729,"This film is so caleidoscopic ; charm , innovative , bittersweet, fresh and above all spontaneous . Allen smelt the bitter times and decided to create a gentle and sincere work about the unability of getting the whole happiness . He suggests us the concept so many times repeated : the happiness is just a lovely , funny and poetic vignettes colection , but beware about to reach this utopic state for a long time .

We must laugh before being happy ; otherwise we can die without having laughed .

Since Woody and Diane are two isolated human beings in that overwhelming city in which you need to have a center in the mythical sense . They meet and feel that invisible chemistry ; plenty of reciprocal armonies and shared glances .

New York is once more a monumental and changing background to express the greatness and the unability to vibrate to the same frenetic rhtym this city beats .

Thet decide to live together and slowly as a sugessting adagio they remeet they learn the fugacity of the relationship ; the incompatibility of characters and these little diferences which progressively grow and become a invisible barrier where they acquire a new profile of loneliness due to the limits in their emotional spheres . They love themselves but no more than their independence .

Nevertheless Allen knew to avoid to fall in the so well known clich and builds a brilliant ending for both of them .

At last Allen will reveal as a guy filled with new hopes , recognizing his inner weakness and wishing her the best .

But the form in which this romantic drama will develop its own flight is so original and well done that you can not forget it at all and like the good books this cult movie lives with you , and your memories . In particular I must confess I watch it once or twice every year .

The other point to remark is the fundamental concerns given for Allen is in the air . And thanks to that premise engaged besides,  to a wider audience like the european where this film is higly loved too , because the drama (if it is real ) exits no matter you live in Tokio , Oslo or Vienna .

942266,5,6304907729,"Ok, let me get this one thing out of the way: when I was 12, Annie Hall beat Star Wars for the Best Picture Academy Award, and I was not a happy kid. However, time can do funny things...
I first saw this picture a few years later, with my first real girlfriend (hi, Lisa!) on the revival circuit. I found it witty and intelligent, as I have with most of Woody Allen's films. I have to say that, to my 16-year-old mind, it still didn't make a huge impression. Twenty years and a failed marriage later, however, I think I can honestly say that I now get it.
Annie Hall is, to me, Woody Allen's greatest triumph as a filmmaker and a storyteller. It's a bittersweet, often hilarious recounting of a relationship from its start to its inevitable end. We see Allen at his most honest, at times brutal examination of himself and his destructive approach to relationships as he plays Alvy Singer, a funny, neurotic comedian (not a great stretch for Woody, granted). All the angst, the neuroses, and manic phobias that at first seem so idiosyncratic and charming, eventually become tiring and sad. Here is a man who is so attached to his psychoses that he would be an empty shell without them, and we see the painful fact of this in his reflections of previous relationships and marriages throughout the course of his adult life. Ultimately, this is a character so galvanized by his fears and phobias that he is simply incapable of managing a complex adult relationship, one free of paranoia and anxiety and this is his tragic downfall. In short, he is a small child trapped in the body of a small man.
This is not, however, one of Allen's Bergmanesque forays into introspection. The knee-slapping hilarity of many of the scenes help draw us into his world and the relationship he has with Annie (Diane Keaton, marvelous as always), his friends, his family, and the world around him. A particular favorite is when, on their first meeting, Alvy and Annie exchange basic getting-to-know-you small talk, and their hidden meanings and anxieties are shown to us in subtitles. Other scenes involving a movie-line blowhard, a lost mantra, and Annie's decidedly white-bread family are the stuff of legend, and they never fail to bring a smile to my face.
Though this film is nearing thirty-years old, it shows no sign of aging. The themes are familiar and universal; who hasn't fallen desperately in love, only to feel the painful tentacles of fear come creeping in the moment they've opened their heart for all the world to see?

Although it's a bit difficult to see what Annie sees in Alvy (though this adds to the charm), Keaton's Annie is absolutely adorable in her awkward self-consciousness.  Fantasy, nostalgia, tenderness, and some of the funniest dialogue in movie history make this one of the best movies ever.

Until now, I've never seen a Woody Allen movie.

Boy, I sure was a ""miss out"".

Annie Hall, made in 1977, is a classic.  Why, oh why, did I wait so long?

First of all it's a story, and a very funny story at that, about a New York Jewish comedian, played by Woody Allen and his WASP girlfriend, played by Diane Keaton.  It pokes fun at many social mores that we take for granted and I found myself laughing throughout.  There's the New Yorker who never learns to drive, the mid-westerner who orders a pastrami sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise (which seems almost grotesque to a New Yorker like me), the pretentious movie critic, the neuroses of modern romances, and the differences between the New York and Los Angeles way of life.

The film runs along at such a fast pace that there is almost no time at all between funny moments.  And, to make it even better, there are some wonderful film techniques.  For example, while Diane Keaton and Woody Allen are talking about photography, there are subtitles on the screen about the physical relationship that they are really thinking about.

If the film were made today the phone calls would have been made on cell phones.  But surprisingly, that is the only detail that might be changed.  Annie Hall has really truly stood the test of time.  And I loved it.",1084492800,105,1341,4.5103734439834025

Although New York is showcased, Los Angeles takes a second seat as the self indulgent, narcissistic counterpart. There are too many hilarious scenes to mention, other than they are non-stop and all hit pay dirt. This is also one of Allen's most inventive films, using split frame scenes for discussions between opposed families, inter-spliced time-gags (invisible characters visiting their past), cartoons representing the main characters and Allen narrating most of the film; sometimes directly into the audience's face.

It should also be noted that many stars got a big start from this film. Carole Kane is featured as one of Alvy's good-hearted girlfriends, along with a post-hippie Shelley Duvall. Diane Keaton's brother is played by a typically creepy Christopher Walken and her mother by the noble Colleen Dewhurst. Paul Simon, Truman Capote, Beverly DeAngelo and Dick Cavett also make guest appearances. Watch for the very young Sigourney Weaver as Alvy's date outside of a theater.

942275,5,6304907729,"Woody Allen's professional integrity has held fast for over a quarter century. Commercial concerns have never deterred the artist from pushing through on a particular idea or project. It is well known that over the many years of filmmaking, he created an insular production company and connected himself to people (producers) who would accept any film proposal on face value - sometimes merely on the bases of one telephone conversation. In some cases, Allen's films were great successes, 'Hannah and Her Sisters' and 'Crimes and Misdemeanours', but sometimes his ideas didn't pan out and the picture lost money. Woody Allen is often quoted as saying, ""If I don't like something, it doesn't matter how many awards it's won. It's important to keep your own criteria and not defer to the trends of the marketplace."" (Allen never attended the Oscars during the 70's 80' and 90's because his band performed in New York on Monday nights.) When ~Annie Hall~ opened in the late seventies, the studio was nervous. In fact they didn't know what to make of this strange picture, but decided to take a chance anyway. ~Annie~ turned out to be a commercial and critical success, which also launched Diane Keaton as a major Hollywood star.
This is not just a good film but a great film. Every scene has at least three to four gags that seem to never grow stale. When Alvie Singer (Woody Allen) meets Annie for the first time, she's obviously quite nervous and fills the pregnant silences with ""La ti da, la ti da..."" He says, ""I'm dating a woman who says, ""La ti da"". This reminded me of Seinfeld's famous, ""Yada yada yada..."" Allen's wit runs hot and fast in this film and one has to pay close attention to catch all the great lines. One of my favourites is a short conversation about the media that Alvie has with his ex wife, Robin:
Robin: ""I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.""
""Commentary""
Alvie: 'Oh really? I heard that Commentary and Dissent merged and formed
Dysentery.""
In comedies particularly, the chemistry between the actors is essential for the joke and scene to work. The chemistry between Keaton and Allen has now become legendary. In the hilarious ""Lobster"" scene, you can tell they really like each other and have a lot of fun, on and off screen. They were of course once a couple, but they continue to be great friends and attribute their professional and creative successes to each other. One can see this relationship blossoming in ~Annie Hall~.
This film really launched Allen into the mainstream, however, because he never makes films for the popular marketplace, he moves in and out of the general public eye. This is the classic Woody Allen picture and one of his better films, that should be a part of every film lover's collection.",1066003200,5,2799,4.785123966942149

942297,5,6304907729,"This film and Hannah and Her Sisters are my two favorites among Allen's many films. Of course there are brilliant scenes in the others but, in my opinion, they lack the seamless integration of acting, dialog, and narrative which Annie and Hannah possess. In any event, I enjoy seeing them more each time, in part because I see something I missed before. Alvy Singer (Allen) unexpectedly becomes involved with Annie Hall (Keaton). At least initially, neither he nor we know quite what to make of her. Over time, for various reasons, their relationship weakens. Each has needs the other really cannot fully satisfy. Both seem unable to enjoy themselves (hence their relentless introspection, self-doubts, insecurities, and therapy sessions) and probably for that reason, they have a very difficult time enjoying anyone else. For them, happiness is only temporary and always conditional. The supporting cast is among the strongest in Allen's films thus far. I especially enjoy the performances by Tony Roberts (Rob), Carol Kane (Allison), Christopher Walken (Duane Hall) and Colleen Dewhurst (Mom Hall). One of the most memorable scenes involves Marshall McLuhan (as himself) who corrects a pseudo-intellectual in the movie line. Paul Simon (Tony Lacey) and Sigourney Weaver (as Alvy's date) also make brief appearances. Annie Hall received an Academy Award as best film and Allen received two (for directing and co-writing best original screenplay with Marshall Brickman); Diane Keaton also received an Academy Award as best actress. The film is still refreshing and entertaining after more than 25 years. One other highly subjective opinion: unlike so many (perhaps even most) of Allen's other films, Annie Hall has many moments of tenderness and even poignancy amidst the always clever conversations. Allen has raised neurosis to new levels of self-revelation. To his credit, he never allows this film to dwell there as a permanent residence. Its charm as well as candor are wholly authentic and sustained until the inevitable conclusion.",1058745600,5,2038,5.35202492211838
942298,5,6304907729,"I rented ""Annie Hall"" before buying it, just to make sure I liked it.  Well I more than liked it!  It is so realistic of what happens with romances.
Before seeing this movie, I had not seen many of Woody Allen's films.  Actually, this one was my first.  It has since become my favorite.  I love how Allen combines humor and drama in this movie.
Diane Keaton gives a *wonderful* performance in this movie as Annie Hall.  She is both strong and weak at the same time.  When she wants to do something, she does it.  Alvy Singer (Allen) basically goes along for the ride and is quite the opposite of her, which is what I think made these two the perfect match for one another.
As I watched the movie, I could also see that there was this 'click' with Keaton and Allen.  They work so well together on-screen.  I saw that same click when I saw ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" and ""Manhattan.""
And let's not forget the fasion trend that Annie Hall created!
One little thing I will advise you on is this: if you are not a Woody Allen fan, you may not enjoy the movie.  If you are a Woody Allen fan, you'll most likely love the movie.  If you know nothing about him, rent the movie and fall in love with it.  I did!",1058227200,3,1201,4.214912280701754
942299,5,6304907729,"Woody Allen isn't for everyone.  And if self-deprecating, neurotic New York Jewish humor isn't your bag, you probably won't like ""Annie Hall"".  As an avid Woody Allen fan, I consider it his masterpiece.  From start to finish, there isn't a single shot that I would change.  Even the final line, ""most of us needs the eggs"", is brilliant... the perfect Darwinian ponto final to an postmodern pastiche of Fellini, Bergman and Welles that questions the nature of gender, relationships and existence itself.  It's one of the few films composed almost entirely of flashbacks that works, free from the usual side order of corn.  And it's funny!  Outstanding performances are turned in by Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Colleen Dewhurst, Woody Allen himself and a newcomer named Christopher Walken.  Honestly, I can't imagine a more perfect film.  What ""Citizen Kane"" started, ""Annie Hall"" completes.  Sure it's puerile at times... sure it's ""self-indulgent""... and intentionally so.  It's part of the psychological tapestry that Allen weaves.  If you don't get it, you don't get it (and a lot of people DON'T get it and don't want to.)  What Allen did here he was unable to replicate in any other project... in terms of scope, range of emotions, philosophical integrity, cinematography,  etc.  It's difficult to believe that the same director who now turns out vapid junk like ""Small Time Crooks"" and ""Hollywood Ending"".

I decided to rent it because it is on the list of the American Film Institute's 100 most funny movies (in fact, it is very high on the list!).  My expectations were to laugh out loud.  I viewed it in one room while my husband worked in another.  Afterward I went in to the room where he was and asked him if he had heard me laughing.  He said, ""No...""  I said, ""Exactly.""
My biggest complaint, ironically, is that this is a negative movie.  Woody Allen's jokes can be very clever, but I ended up feeling so sorry for his character and his character's outlook on life, that I had a hard time laughing.  I did smile at the runaway lobster scene.  That was my favorite, because it had nothing to do with unhappiness.  The lobster hid behind the refrigerator and Woody Allen said that he would put some butter at one side and the lobster would run out the other.
Woody as his character (Alvy Singer) said there are two kinds of people in the world, the miserable, and even worse (like suicidal).  I really felt sorry for him  - his character's outlook on life really hurt him and his relationships.
If you want to watch this movie to see some failures in relationships, that would be a reason to watch it.  But someone said this movie is free from bitterness, and I would disagree.",1051488000,5,1331,4.383673469387755

She's eccentric, pert, obnoxiously funny and genuinely human.  This role won Diane Keaton her Best Actress Oscar.  Woody is of course his usually brilliant depricating self.  The film also took home the Best Picture Oscar.  This is a definite must have for lovers of New York, Best Pictures or Woody Allen films.
The MGM DVD transfer is widescreen but not anamorphic - a real shame.  Colors are dated but nicely balanced.  While fine details leave something to be desired, particularly in night scenes, the over all picture quality is quite pleasing and easy on the eyes.  Minor edge enhancement appears throughout but nothing that will terribly distract.  The sound is MONO as originally intended.  There are no extras.

Oscars also for Allen's direction, his screenplay (co-written by Marshall Brickman) and Best Picture. Look quickly for Jeff Goldblum's cameo (""I forgot my mantra"") at Paul Simon's So. Cal. Party, John Glover in a flashback party scene with Annie, Shelley Hack in a sidewalk scene, veteran character actor Tracey Walter and Beverly D'Angelo in the sitcom tape Roberts is sweetening with a laugh track in an edit bay, Woody's longtime friend and future producer Jean Doumanian in the coke scene, and at the film's end Sigourney Weaver (trust me it's her, but it is in a long shot and no dialogue) as Alvy's latest girlfriend. Best reaction shot: Allen with Keaton and Walken in a car after Walken has proclaimed his sudden urges of death. Also, I too wish I could do what Allen does in shutting up a movie-line pontificator like he does with media expert Marashall McLuhan.

Woody Allen delivers the goods in this terribly witty and romantic film, Diane Keaton matches his quality too.

942303,5,6304907729,"ANNIE HALL represents a turning point in Woody Allen's career.  Before it, he was primarily known as the crafter of a series of very, very funny films.  But he was not truly considered a serious filmmaker.  After ANNIE HALL, Allen has been known more as a serious filmmaker, but not as funny as he was earlier in his career.  This film belongs in both worlds, as funny as his earlier films, and as serious as any of his later.  He was able to strike a perfect balance here that he was never able to strike again.  Many I know wish he would shoot for films as funny as SLEEPER or LOVE AND DEATH.  I would prefer the balance he struck in this, his masterpiece.
Although this is a serious film at heart, it is also a comic masterpiece.  Woody pulls out every kind of joke, whether verbal, situational, slapstick, or absurd, and a few forms he invented himself.  The structure of the entire film is something unique to Woody.  At points he addresses the audience directly.  At other times, he seems to have the powers of a deity to manipulate every aspect of a scene.  He can transport himself back in time to query former classmates about what they are doing as adults.  He can summon up Marshall McLuhan to have him tell someone else that he doesn't understand his theories.  At the same time, he seamlessly injects the kind of self-deprecating humor that was the mainstay of both his stand up routines and earlier movies.  It is one of the most virtuosic comedy films ever made.
The film made Diane Keaton a star.  She was not unknown when the film was made.  She had, after all, played an important role in THE GODFATHER films.  She had appeared in two previous Woody Allen films, and had become famous as the person in HAIR who would not remove her clothes.  But ANNIE HALL was the making of her.  She created a great character, and the ""Annie Hall"" look had considerable influence on fashion for some time after the film was released, and anyone hearing ""la-dee-dah"" knows exactly where it came from.
One thing that isn't sufficiently noted is the incredible eye for talent that Woody Allen's casting directors have displayed over the years.  The number of major stars to appear in Woody Allen films very early in their careers is eye popping.  This one is not exception.  Christopher Walken has a small but memorable role as Annie's insane brother, Beverly D'Angelo has a small role as an actress, and Woody's tall, attractive date at the end of the film when running into Annie on the sidewalk is none other than Sigourney Weaver.",1046822400,,2534,4.569844789356985

It is common to read Woody Allen's films in self-referential terms, the legitimacy of which he himself denies. His films, however, virtually cry out for such an interpretation, concerned as they are with the complex and often blurred interrelations of life and art, reality and fantasy (as here, and also, most notably, Deconstructing Harry, almost twenty years later). Plus Woody makes it so tempting to view his main characters not as ""Alvie Singer"" (his name in this picture), but as ""Woody Allen"". Virtually all his characters are neurotic writers or comedians with problem love-lives - in other words, the person who emerges from Woody Allen's pictures is the real-life Woody Allen. In Annie Hall, Woody reflects on past relationships, in particular his relationship with the girl of the title (played by Diane Keaton).

942350,5,6304907729,"Woody Allen begins ""Annie Hall"" (named for the title character, played by the inimitable Diane Keaton) with a speech in which he relates to the audience his attitude about romantic relationships (gleaned from either Sigmund Freud or Groucho Marx): ""I'd never belong to any club that'd have me as a member.""
Enter the somewhat giddy Annie, a somewhat sophisticated, somewhat naive transplant from the midwestern hinterlands.  Annie and Alvy Singer (Allen's character) soon fall in lust, and the movie explores what happens when the sex and novelty of the relationship wear off.
Alvy soon displays the stock trait of Allen's persona:  Neurotic perfectionism.  Very set in his ways, he becomes frazzled when Annie (and in flashbacks) the other women in his life venture outside the rigid routines Alvy has set in stone.
Another paradox that manifests itself is Allen's classic disdain for political conservatives (targets of his ire are Eisenhower, William F. Buckley and Commentary magazine).  Yet, Alvy is a very *socially* conservative person, who looks down on drug use, rock music and the religious cult fads that characterized the 70s.  A great line from the movie is when Jeff Goldblum -- at a pretentious Hollywood party -- calls his guru to get the latest mantra.
Another gem is Christopher Walken's small role as Annie's brother, which will have you howling once Alvy is riding in his car.
Like it's twin, ""Manhattan,"" ""Annie Hall"" is a love-letter to New York City (not just Manhattan, but to Brooklyn as well, where we visit Alvy's unique childhood home on Coney Island).  But, I prefer this one to ""Manhattan,"" because of its fresh concept, more screen time for Diane Keaton and Allen's ""I Hate L.A."" scenes.",1023408000,5,1718,5.053003533568905

At the same time, I didn't believe in their relationship.  I wasn't convinced of their attraction toward each other so it was even harder to feel sympathy for Allen's character.  Many times throughout, I felt like I was watching a pointless film.  Allen has a free spirit tone, but his nervous and shaky character  became old and annoying fast.

942352,5,6304907729,"Annie Hall completely amazed me with its quick wit, humorous anecdotes
and its message. I felt it was great film in the way it presented Annie and Alvy as a mismatched, but lovable couple. I thought that Woody Allen
accomplished this by his innovative use of narrative. He broke the
standards in order to bring me closer to both main characters.
One technique, which I noticed from the start of the film, was
that Allen spoke directly to the camera. This made me feel that he was
directly speaking to me; I became a part of the conversation. Another
scene which I particularly liked was when he brought Marshall McLuhan
from behind the poster stand to insult the Columbia professor. I was
thinking that this would be the ideal situation. I oftentimes get into
arguments which I can't win, even though I am positively in the right. I was able to identify with Alvy's frustration simply because he looked at me and said,""Boy, if life were only like this"". And I responded right back,""You're right"".
I was also in conflict as to who I was suppose to like better. I
think that I was more sympathetic toward Annie because Allen
consistently showed me Alvy's hypocritical mannerisms and continual
attempts at controlling her life. For instance, when Alvy criticizes Annie's adult education, the screen cuts to a previous scene where Alvy praises adult education. I began to resent Alvy's lack of understanding and bigotry.
Also, I realized that the title of the film was Annie Hall. Thus,
the focus was on Annie through Alvy's eyes. At the end of the film, Alvy
and Annie are shown from a distance. As they say goodbye to one
another, flashbacks of their relationship are shown. Also, there is
background music: Annie sings ""Seems like Old Times"". The last person in
the film is Alvy. The last voice in the film is Annie. I became more linked to Annie because of the musical playback. It was quite amazing.",1020384000,8,1900,4.708708708708708
942353,5,6304907729,"Woody Allen had never been more mature and sensitive than in Annie Hall. A true delight from start to end this isn't a laugh out loud comedy. It's a subtle, charming and smart look in the lives of two strange lovers.
  Allen has always shown us the way people is without really explain why. That's a great thing about his comedies. They focus on normal life, the daily events. He lets all of the one liners, philosophical comments and observations of life lie there unconnected, not forcing them to melt together to reveal an universal truth. He eventually manages to draw a perfect portrait of the way people is and after all is said and done he reaches a conclusion as simple as it is powerfully true.
  Annie Hall is maybe the most moving film to achieve this, since it concentrates in love and the way each relationship changes our lives, even if it doesn't work out you can always take the best of the other person with you.
  Annie Hall is a goofy and insecure aspiring singer who finds a potencial soulmate in Alvyn Singer a nervous, pesimistic and sarcastic comedian. Together they build a relationship in which they try to change each other for the better. Annie manages to brighten obssessed-with-death-Alvyn's life while he gives her the confidence she needs by encouraging her to educate herself and being there to never let her feel like she has failed.
  But as time goes by Annie suddenly has outgrown Alvyn, who still refuses enjoy things and not worry. It's now up to them to decide what they will do.
  The film reaches the bittersweet conclusion as Alvyn and Annie see again and each one understands that they didn't waste time with each other, and that their relationship help them change so much that they can't fully get over each other. The movie ends with a melancholic and moving secuence of several shots from different parts of the movie each one presenting the couple in their happy moments and Allen saying: ""...It was great seeing Annie again, right?  I realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just knowing her"". With that line he closes a chapter of his life in a sweet and happy way.
  Annie Hall is a terrific film, full of smart one-liners and sarcastic remarks in the old Allen style, the direction is sublime and the pace is fluid though the way of storytelling could be confusing for some.

942405,5,6304907729,"'Annie Hall' has been called the first modern romantic comedy, but it is actually the ultimate anti-romantic comedy.  Where the movement of the classic rom-com is the union of two mismatched lovers, the kiss, marriage - a forward movement which is' in effect' sexual sublimation - 'Annie Hall' begins with its romance's break-up, and proceeds with a vignette narrative structure, in which time and space are fragmented: far from gathering any momentum, the film, with is modest highs and lows, kind of peters out, just like romance in real-life.
'Annie Hall' is, as everyone knows, the first truly great Woody Allen movie.  All the cherishable elements from his previous films are here - the nervy wisecracks (which, far from containing life's anguish, seem to helplessly acknowledge the impossibility of ever doing so); the visual and narrative trickery; the flippant allusions etc. - but are given depth and feeling by the focus on character.  The opening monologue sets the tone - Alvy's stand-up routine (an address to the public) as confession (private): this is a relationship constantly being pushed into social situations (family, parties, night classes etc.).
The movements through time and space, the documentary feel for real locations, the recognition of the emotional import of seemingly trivial events, all combine to create a complex picture of people alive and in love in a particular place and time.  In the case of Alvy especially, these elements serve to reveal the character his joking is at pains to deflect.
The film is the closest American film every came to the spontaneity of the French New Wave, without being cripplingly self-conscious about it - the inventive chopping between visual registers and narrative moods; the romanticising of city life; the seemingly casual, but crucial and resonant, allusions to films, books, music etc.; the satire of cultural pretensions; above all, the very modern, elusive relationship at its centre - all creating a film as fresh, funny and poignant as the day it was made, one done a great disservice by its sappy imitators.  Diane Keaton has rarely been more enchanting, the fluidity between herself and her character so evident, she seems to be laughing with us at the film she's in.",1006387200,11,2248,5.131147540983607

Woody Allen is definitely an inspiration for many of today's comedians, particularly Jerry Seinfeld for sure.  This is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while.  Woody Allen breaks many cliche barriers and has created an excellent film.  I recommend this one to anybody who likes comedy.  Watch for appearences by Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken.

942409,5,6304907729,"Almost every superlative has been applied to this piece of little heaven, so I'll skip adding mine, since it will just be drowned in the masses of superlatives. The first time I saw this absolutely wonderful film, I had mixed feelings, because I was not expecting Woody Allen's innovative camera works, dialogue, and references to literary works, since very few films use those kind of assets. However, when I watched it again, I fell in love with it. It's so bittersweet and tangible, that it's nearly impossible not to relate. It's a wholesomely feel-good film, and one feels happy and sad while watching it. We examine every depth of Alvy and Annie's relationship, and during the process, we become entwined with their lives, and we feel along with them. The dialogue is clever, hilarious, and at times sad and poignant, if not unbelievably relevant to the everyday routine of people's lives. The last lines of this film: ""This guy goes to the doctor and says, 'Doc, my brother's crazy. He thinks he's a chicken.' and the doc says, 'Well, why don't you turn him in? 'I would, but I need the eggs.' That's exactly how I feel about relationships now. They're totally irritational and crazy, yet we keep going through them because most of us need the eggs."" God, what a wonderful line. It's a PERFECT explanation of why we go through painful relationships and keep searching for reasons why we do. This film takes a close look at every aspect of people's lives. Infidelity, friends, jobs, religions, relationships, drugs, futures, insecurities, people's feelings, families, death, fantasy, pasts....ALL IN ALL, Annie Hall is truly one of the most beautiful, poignant works of the era. It is IMPOSSIBLE to emulate this piece of perfection. Do WHATEVER you have to do to see this. You'll never forgive yourselves if you choose to watch flaccid pieces of films and pass over ANNIE HALL. God bless DVD. I'm so happy the film is on DVD. I will never ever let go of this piece of heaven as long as I live!",990230400,,1999,4.763688760806916

942412,4,6304907729,"Annie Hall is thinly veiled autobiographical film from Woody Allen.  Mr. Allen plays Alvy Singer who is a standup comic and the most neurotic person ever put on film.  The film travels back and forth in time through Alvy's life and we gets glimpses of his childhood, his first marriage and other benchmarks in his life.  The movie details his relationship with Diane Keaton's title character.  The film acts as a catharsis for Mr. Allen and we, the audience, are like his psychiatrist with him on the couch.  The film contains classic Allenesque lines about life, death, California and other subjects and it doesn't appear that Mr. Allen is really acting.  He's more or less playing himself. Ms. Keaton is delightful as the majorly quirky Annie and Tony Roberts is great as Alvy's best friend.  Paul Simon, Carol Kane, Christopher Walken and others pop up along the way in brief cameos.  The film was a major triumph and actually beat out Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar with Mr. Allen taking home the Best Director and Screenwriter Awards and Ms. Keaton winning the Best Actress statuette.",981331200,4,1100,4.8138297872340425
942413,5,6304907729,"It has become somewhat of a cliche among filmmaker's and Woody Allen buffs to portray 'Annie Hall' as the quintessential ""Woody Allen film"".  Although while tired, that discription is accurate.  With this 1977 picture, Allen perfectly combined his earlier goofball antics with his later more introspective philosophical style.
First, the wacky hijinks--Allen plays a New York comedian, and is of course his usual neurotic self.  We are treated to an array of bizarre scenerios that blend his not uncommon relationship with the 'reality' only found in movies.  While being annoyed by a loud film critic in a line, Allen brings out the particular filmmaker he's criticizing; Allen is taken on a flashbacks to his childhood and insane parents; and need I mention the lobster scene?
These occurences mixed in with everything else is what prevents this movie from recieving the label 'romanti comedy'.  While relationship movies are quite common, few have the philosophical tone set by Woody Allen.  He looks at man-woman interactions as if it were a puzzle he tries to solve but knows he'll never get it.  While countless have tried this approach, it has never been as flawlessly executed as Allen.  And perhaps in 'Annie Hall', he succeeded in a playing his message most clearly.",979776000,,1276,5.100961538461538
942414,4,6304907729,Annie Hall is a classic movie and I love it and have loved it for many years. Last night as I watched my newly purchased DVD edition (my taped version was falling apart) I noticed a shocking error. In the scene where Alvy (Allen) and Annie (Keaton) first meet they go up on her terrace to have a glass of wine and begin to discuss some esoteric b.s. In the original film there are clever subtitles stating what the two characters are actually thinking and feeling while spouting their nonsense. In the DVD version that I purchased here at this site the subtitles were missing. It's a brilliant scene that was sadly botched by whomever made these DVD's. I still really enjoyed the movie I only wish that such a classic scene wouldn't have been overlooked.,979603200,4,754,4.551470588235294
942445,5,6304907729,"Annie Hall was a turning point for Woody toward more 'serious' and somewhat autobiobraphical films.  It remains his most popular film and won 4 Accademy Awards.
The way Allen combined his New York characters with sharp satirical comments on everything from intellectual phoniness, racism and sexual angst to shared experiences like standing in line at the movies was new, fresh and original.
He re-invented the modern romantic comedy and his style has been much imitated ever since. I could see Annie Hall's influence recently in Tao of Steve.
Allen was not giving us a romantic feel good romance like a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan film.  And he's certainly not a charismatic or even charming leading man.  This was an awkward, warts and all romance which was sometimes uncomfortable to watch.
The film begins with Allen as Alvy Singer talking directing to the camera and explaining that he's quite upset because he's broken up with Annie.  (It doesn't quite match up, time wise when we get to the end of the film-but then the time-line throughout the film is toyed with in the style of Fellini's 8 1/2). He says:
""  The other important joke for me is one that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx but I think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious - and it goes like this. I'm paraphrasing. I would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member. That's the key joke of my adult life, in terms of my relationships with women.""
Alvy Singer is Allen's alter-ego -a stand up comic and Allen's quintessential New York character. This pessimistic, paranoid, is too smart to be a naive romantic, but yearns to be exactly that.  He's always a fish out of water, because he is not comfortable with his own thoughts and can not accept either his good qualities nor his bad ones.  So he's forever going to be in analysis.  He is impatient with everyone-including himself and has to whine about everything that bothers him.  He has a propensity to say the wrong thing at the wrong time and to wait too long to say the right thing.  He'll let something slip out of his mouth uncensored, and when he tries to soften it, he only makes it worse.  Yet he actually means no harm.  He's merely rejecting everything he can before it ultimately rejects him.  His fears and paranoias are worn on his sleeve.  He'll not be hurt, because who would want to get past all his `stuff' to really get to know him and have an opportunity to hurt him.  He wears his inferiority complex as both a security blanket and a suit of armor.
And then there is Annie.  A women who is utterly vulnerable, yet extremely tough.  Someone who refuses to be pessimistic but is ready for a change because the path she has been on has not led to anything or anyone substantial.  Maybe Alvy is perfect for her.  Annie is smart, but not as intellectual or well read as Alvy.  She's a bundle of scattered energy and feels the need to smoke dope before she has sex.  She's full of insecurities but she's trying to over come them, not wear them like a security blanket. Annie lacks confidence, but she isn't afraid.  She doesn't believe in herself, but she knows she should and really wants to.  She knows she needs to grow and change and she knows Alvy might help her do that-even if as she grows and change she leaves Alvy behind.
And so we have the bittersweet romance. And it's because the film is first about the romance and then about Allen's obsessions and interests that made the film his most popular.
Nearly all of the film's scenes are laugh out loud funny.  Some are laying bare the relationship, some are exposing Alvy's neuroses or forcing us to recognize how ridiculous people can be. Some are full brilliant comic inventiveness-such as when the class room of kids stand up and as little kids, with children's voices tell us what they are doing now.  One is a plumber, another is a junkie, another is into leather.
Annie Hall may be full of sharp observance but it keeps its distance from the audience with it's almost too clever gimmicks.  Woody breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the camera several times during the film. He uses surrealistic gags, and even a brief animated sequence in the film.  He even has Paul Simon playing a record producer who really likes Annie Hall.  We get several New York versus Los Angeles jokes, that seem a bit stale now. We also get the funny subtitle scene.  Annie Hall is less personal and intimate than Allen's next film would be (Manhattan)but it's a little funnier.
And let's not forget the film also had an  amazing fashion influence.  The Annie Hall look is still with us.
OF INTEREST:
The relationship between Alvy and Annie is full of easy to make real life parallels.  The film's title  incorporates Diane Keaton's real name- Diane Hall and her nickname Annie.
Carol Kane has a small role as Alvy's first wife.
Christopher Walken has a small role playing Annie Hall's brother who confesses having suicidal thoughts to Alvy.
Jeff Goldblum is seen briefly, but memorably as part of the Los Angeles party scene.  He is on the phone and says: ""I forgot my mantra.""

942447,1,6304907729,"Because if you're under 30 and NOT an old movie buff nor WoodyAllen fan, then you will probably come to the same conclusion that my friends and I came to after sitting through ""Annie Hall"" - it's very much like having your teeth drilled without anesthetic while your dentist makes slightly humorous jokes during the process.
With all the praise this movie has had heaped all over it, we (my friends and I) decided to NOT get our hopes up and to do our best to watch it objectively (we do this every time we watch a ""classic"" movie to remove expectations - it makes it MUCH more enjoyable to open the mind and watch it ""cold"").  In retrospect, I guess it would have been better to keep reminding ourselves, over and over again, just how ""important"" this flacid piece of crap is supposed to be.
I guess it was groudbreaking at the time (no one thought to make a self-indulgent, 2-hour-plus film about uninteresting people droning ceaselessly about their uninteresting problems, uninteresting relationships, and uninteresting lives before? . . . . go figure!), but Allen's CONSTANT whining is absolutely torturous, as is Keaten's disjointed, schizophrenic protrayal of her character (seriously, we all - boys and girls included - wanted to slap her EVEN MORE than we did Woody!).  We eventually decided that BOTH characters tie Jar-Jar Binks for ""Most Annoying Screen Persona in History""!  We literally had to FORCE ourselves to finish this movie, just so we could all say that we saw it.
This movie may be ""important"", but sitting through it is a horrifyingly boring and nerve-grating experience.  Are we supposed to care for these saps?  We didn't just ""not empathize"" with Woody or Keaton's characters, we ACTUALLY HATED both of them - God, they're both just so insipid and redundant!  The only redeeming quality in either character is that Diane leaves Woody (finally!) and is thankfully absent from much of the later part of the film.
""Citizen Kane""?  Mesmerizing! ""Chinatown""?  Shocking!  ""Dr.  Stragelove""? Hilarious!  ""The Searchers""?  Engaging and touching! ""Annie Hall""?  yawn-PUKE!  Sure, ""Annie Hall"" may be ""important"", but so is ""Beowulf""!  Why would anyone EVER recommend this movie to someone who isn't an enemy?
I give it one star because there are SOME lines intended to be funny that actually approach their goal.  I think during the 2.5 hours of torture that is ""Annie Hall"", our group chuckled a few times (note that a chuckle and a laugh are completely different things!), so it's not COMPLETELY unfunny - just 98% so!
YES, we ""got"" ALL the jokes.  Don't think for a second that Woody's sense of humor isn't accessible, because ""getting it"" is PAINFULLY easy. Appreciating it, however, must be a torture test required to be initiated into some snotty film club or something.  I think that, even more than the annoying characters, their fingernails-on-chalkboard dialogue, or ""Annie Hall""'s marathon length, what I recall most is thinking, ""THAT was a joke? "" while my stomach churned and churned.
