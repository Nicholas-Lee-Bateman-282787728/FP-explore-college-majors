4024017,3,B002ZG98DM,"This summer, we took our five-and-a-half year old to watch several kid friendly movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002ZG97YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Train Your Dragon (Single Disc Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-3/dp/B00275EHJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 3</a>, Shrek 4, etc. It is rather difficult to find a movie that a child and adults can enjoy together. When ""Marmaduke"" popped up at our local dollar movie theater, we decided to give it a try after receiving positive feedback from our friends with kids.

I can't really compare this movie with the comic strip which I grew up with. The writers have definitely used some creative license with the plot. Here, Marmaduke the Great Dane (voiced by Owen Wilson) is living happily in Kansas with his human family, the Winslows when Phil Winslow (Lee Pace) gets offered a promising new job with Bark Organics in the OC, California. The rest of the family is reluctant to make the big move but they do it anyway. Marmaduke finds himself in strange new surroundings, and discovers how even dogs' lives can be complicated with a social divide between the pedigrees, led by Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend Jezebel (Fergie) and the non-pedigree breeds aka mutts such as Maizie (Emma Stone),Raisin and Giuseppe. Marmaduke falls hard for Jezebel and inevitably ends up in a pickle when he attempts to be something he is not in a bid to win Jezebel's affections and gain the respect of the other dogs.

The human-centered plot is secondary to the dog-centered story, mainly revolving around Phil's attempts to please his demanding, eccentric boss (played by William Macy) and balancing the demands of work and family, which Phil fails at miserably.

The action is fast-paced so the youngsters in the audience don't get a chance to get fidgety (a great plus!), but the story is rather derivative and if you have high expectations for a well-plotted, intelligent movie then this is not it. On the other hand, if you just want to watch a fun movie with lots of dogs (many different breeds, and lots of well-groomed beautiful dogs such as Afghan hounds, etc.) then this might just entertain. It kept our daughter's attention and oh, we also loved Marmaduke's step-brother Carlos the Cat (George Lopez) and the Chupadogra (voiced by Sam Elliott)!",1281916800,25,2481,5.558201058201059
4024018,5,B002ZG98DM,"Why are people so critical toward dog movies? It's for the family to enjoy together, if you love dogs. I've never actually read any of the comics, so I can't compare it. Marmaduke is a huge Great Dane that lives with the Winslow family. They soon move to California, and it gives Marmaduke a chance to reinvent himself. At the dog park, he makes friends with Mazie, Guiseppe, and Raisin. He also makes an enemy with Bosco, who is very controlling and jealous when it comes to Jezebel. Eventually, he'll have to decide who truly are his friends. It gets a little emotional toward the end. I highly recommend MARMADUKE!!!",1276128000,40,619,4.636363636363637

4024839,1,B002ZG98DM,"It's kinda like a cookie-cutter after school special about a kid in a new town but with dogs, except the cookie cutter was warped and misshapen, and the cookie was left in the over for like 3 hours too long because you just found out that your wife was cheating on you and you silently stared out the window into the black of night sipping scotch and contemplating the misery of your own trivial existence and ignoring the smell of burning cookies.

There's scatological humor, several trivial subplots that never wind up mattering, and a climax that itself is the deus ex machina of the conflict. That's all pretty horrible and I was going to give it 2 out of 5 stars, but then I remembered it has Owen Wilson, so 1 out of 5.",1464048000,,726,4.377777777777778

4025148,4,B002ZG98DM,"Some talking dog movies can be quite cringeworthy and you're secretly hoping the power will go out for the duration they are playing.  I thought Marmaduke was going to be like that at the start, especially when for some reason every time Marmaduke talks, we've got to see his mouth move.  I found the mouth moving to be very noticeable and wondered why the human characters never noticed it.  Although it is a bit of distraction to the events in the film you don't seem to not notice it as much as the film goes on.  Marmaduke has quite a good selection of well known actors voicing the parts of various dogs, which was why I checked it out in the first place.  Owen Wilson is the title character, a giant great dane, when they switch to a CGI dog at times he looks like Scooby Doo in those CGI movies.  But you've also got Kiefer Sutherland, Emma Stone, Damon Wayans Jr., Marlon Wayans, Steve Coogan, Fergie and others.  The human actors aren't so well known, but you've still got William H. Macy and Judy Greer in minor screen time appearance roles.  The lesser known actors (rest of Marmaduke's family) do an okay job too.

It's not the most realistic movie, but it's a kids' movie and involves talking dogs so you probably weren't expecting it to be.  Basically Marmaduke has moved to LA with his family and is forced to come to the dog park every day since that's where his owner works out of.  This is an odd dog park where dogs do a lot of sitting around rather than the standard dogs get taken there to run and exercise like in the real world, but this allows the dogs to communicate, threaten, suck up to and try and become cool.  Basically the dog park is their version of high school.  Of course Marmaduke wants to impress the alpha female dog who is in a relationship with the park alpha and bully.  He is oblivious to the feelings of a female dog that helps him out and learns a few lessons such as remembering who your friends are along the way.  In the human side of the story the father needs to learn that his family should come first, not his work.

I've never read the cartoon strip this movie was based on, and you don't need to, to enjoy this movie.",1451174400,2,2170,4.334158415841584

  When Marmaduke(Wilson) moves to a new neighborhood with his family, the super-sized teenage dog soon discovers he just doesn*t fit in---literally!  But, with the help of his best pal Carlos the Cat(Lopez) and some newfound four-legged friends, Marmaduke
may just get out of the doghouse, fall in love, and surf into the sunset.

Lee Pace is on of my favorite actors (and vastly under-rated, in my humble opinion) and a usually annoying Owen Wilson is a perfect voice for Marmaduke. My grand-daughter first saw this movie when she was 4 and she loved it, she is six and still loves it -- two years! -- quite a feat considering that her usual attention-span for movies is about 1/2 an hour. This is one of two movies she will watch over and over again, the whole way through.

4027067,5,B002ZG98DM,"This is not a great film in the generally accepted sense.  It is not an Oscar winner or even nominee.  But, it is an Oskar winner!  It is a film that can be watched again and again.  It is a family film that kids will enjoy, but not only.  When you are stressed, tired, angry, down, or just plain not interested in thinking about something deep - car crashes, homicide, rape, or the state of the economy for example - this is the film to watch.  Of course it helps if you are an animal lover - actually that is probably a necessity.  Essentially it is about a Great Dane (Marmaduke) played by a real live Great Dane (probably Danes), which is a real trick since they are stubborn, thick headed, and most reluctant to obey on command.

4028093,4,B002ZG98DM,"I always enjoy the Marmaduke comic strip when ever I see it.
 Since 1954, Brad Anderson has been drawing ""Marmaduke"" with the assistance of Phil Leeming (1955-1962), Dorothy Leeming (1963-69) and Paul Anderson (2004-present).
  Marmaduke was also seen in the animated tv series, Heathcliff (1980-82) on ABC.
  This is the live-action motion picture of Marmaduke (2010), the loveable great dane. CGI-effects is used to show the animals talking and in other situations.

 Marmaduke (voice of Owen Wilson) introduces his family to you and the yard he likes to dig in. His only friend in Kansas is the pet cat, Carlos (voice of George Lopez). Their owner Phil Winslow (Lee Pace) decides to leave Kansas to accept a new job and move to Orange County in California.
We get to see how Marmaduke tries to adjust to his new life in sunny California. At least the doggie door is big enough for him.

 Also in the cast: Judy Greer, Finley Jacobsen, Caroline Sunshine, Milana Haines, William Macy.

 Other voice work by: Emma Stone, Fergie, Kiefer Sutherland, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Sam Elliott, Marlon Wayans, Damon wayans Jr, Ted Glass.

 Option of language and subtitles in English and Spanish.

 Extras: Deleted Scenes, Cowabarka, Canine Casting.

4028218,1,B002ZG98DM,"We like family oriented movies at times.  We love Under Dog, Cats and Dogs and ect.  However, we were sorely disappointed with this movie.  It looked funny and since I grew up reading the Marmaduke comic strip...it should have been funny.  It had the voices of some rahter famous people including Keifer Sutherland, Sam Elliot, George Lopez and Owen Wilson.  However, whoever chose Owen Wilson to voice Marmaduke must have been beat with the stupid stick.  Wilson's voice is not ""big"" enough plus his flighty personality is not what one would get from a Great Dane.  Scooby Doo had a more masculine voice and personality than Marmaduke.  Also, Carlos (the fluffy cat voiced by George Lopez) was hardly in the movie?? I have the same problem with the ""Chupadogra"" character (Sam Elliot).  The viewer gets one lecture from Chupadogra then that's it??  Plus, like other reviewers, why did the movie start and end with a fart joke??  Is that the movie's idea of coming full circle???  Scooby Doo had a fart joke in it and it was a rather long one but at least it was a bit different....this had the same fart joke.",1319155200,4,1110,4.664948453608248

4028220,1,B002ZG98DM,"Let me start by saying that the only similarity between the Maramduke cartoon and this movie is that the main character is a Great Dane named Maramaduke and his male adult owner is named Phil.  After that it's just another teenager moves to a new town, tries to fit in, acts stupid, loses all friends, then finds true self.  Only been done thousands of time.  The twist with this movie that it's a teenage dog instead of a human.

Jokes are predictable, acting is mediocre.  Animation of Maramduke okay, other dogs not so much so.  Campy dog dance routine at end is terrible.

If you must see this move, borrow it from you local library or a friend that unfortunately bought it.",1310342400,2,678,4.508196721311475
4028221,1,B002ZG98DM,"Talking dogs must be Hollywood's formulaic answer to attempting to pull a family friendly blockbuster out of thin air. Nearly every live action film featuring a talking dog seems to play out similarly or at least have all the same big moments. Underdog, Scooby Doo, and the Cats & Dogs movies are all guilty of this. We see the dog(s) living it up while partaking in whatever activity they do best, things eventually go wrong, dog learns its lesson, dog does some sort of selfless act that ends up saving the day, and then there's a big, overblown, CGI infested finale featuring something like flying dogs, dancing dogs, dogs using jet packs, or something equally as unbelievable. So in walks a clumsy dog named Marmaduke that follows in the same pawprints of every dog related film before it.

The special effects don't really have any redeeming qualities about them. It's like the people who keep doing these types of movies never learn that a completely computer generated animal looks terrible when it's thrown in the real world. Marmaduke does use real animals the majority of the time, but the way the animals talk looks pretty bad. Some animals look better when they talk (Mazie) than others (Marmaduke), but it still looks awkward. It's as if they just move the bottom lip of the animal while stretching or shrinking its eyes to portray emotion. It's like a visual aid for abusive use of botox on animals or something. Not to mention they always decide to blow everything out of proportion in movies like this. It's like they have more of the budget at that point of the movie than they originally intended and they come up with this outrageous scheme to have something to appeal to younger audiences, but dog surfing and choreographed dance featuring large groups of dogs? It's not amusing, especially when you can tell it's not real animals being used. The CG is weak all around though. It's subtle when it's used to make animals talk, but it looks forced and it feels overdone in the scenes that lean on CG to be successful. There's no happy middle ground.

I hope you're a fan of bad puns. Marmaduke is practically overflowing with them. Twist my paw (arm), off the leash (chain), bone-illionaire, barkanova, chupadogra, and licking butt. Just when you think you've heard the worst one, three more pop up just as bad or worse. The cast is also filled to the brim with people overacting the entire time. Most of the actors involved probably won't be too shocking; Owen Wilson, George Lopez, and a few of the Wayans taking part sounds about right. Kiefer Sutherland playing Bosco was a bit of a shock though. Lee Pace having a large role in the movie was, too. The guy was so promising in ""Pushing Daisies"" and The Fall. It's disappointing to see him reduced to this. At least William H. Macy manages to act like himself in this.

I wouldn't suggest actually thinking about the story points either. It's pretty brainless. The dog park being like a high school for dogs is probably around the time you'll want to jump out of the nearest window. Then there's the dogs playing Dance Dance Revolution and dogs making gopher and horse noises. It's just hard to imagine anyone finding something so lame entertaining at all. Also, seriously, this is like the third family movie I've watched in a row featuring a heavy emphasis on urine. Is urine funny now? The whole concept seems really disgusting to me, especially since Marmaduke makes it a point to circle back around to the subject several times. The farting scenes probably didn't help matters either.

Marmaduke is just a really unpleasant excuse of a family movie. It's clich and predictable, littered with overacting, filled with just the worst puns imaginable and borderline obscene when it comes to the amount of animal bodily fluids used throughout the movie. It's very Beethoven in tone, but even goofier and more melodramatic. Even though Marmaduke feels like every other live action talking dog film before it, the cast also feels worn out even though they all seem relatively new to being exposed to this level of atrocity. Delivering a journey that is both dull and agonizing with a destination that could barely be considered lukewarm, you'll be begging for Marmaduke to be put down long before he even has the chance to breakdance (I wish I was making that part up...).",1309564800,5,4341,4.7686170212765955
4028222,5,B002ZG98DM,"They so have Great Danes down in this movie.  It was a delight.  Having had three of them at one time or another, I can definitely guarantee it.  Seeing Marmaduke sit on the couch, like a human would do, reminded me so much of my first Dane, Courageous who used to sit side by side with me watching TV.  Even the fictional character's unwillingness to engage in a fight with another dog was so like my dogs.  It was sort of ""let's discuss this"" with Courageous.  Even the dominant dog in the park scene was familiar.  I took my dog Tempo to a dog park starting as a puppy.  A cane corso mounted him every time to prove he was dominant over Tempo.  Then one day he walked up to Tempo, saw that his butt was actually too high up off the ground to actually even attempt it, and just walked away.  After that it never came up again.  Taking the human for a walk, even the complaints about hearing the comments about ""where's the saddle?"" all the time are also familiar!  For anyone who has never had the blessing of being loved by one of these wonderful animals, this is a perfect introduction.  I adored my Danes and loved the movie.",1308009600,,1130,4.273584905660377
4028223,5,B002ZG98DM,"When I started to watch the movie, I felt disappointed. I thought it was going to be another worthless movie about kids and their pets, where the plot is just like in every other movie, just with better special effects and of course, hollywoods voices. I disliked Owen's voice as for Marmaduke. Every time he spoke, I saw a picture of him in my mind, not the dog. The problem is that the actor is famous, I saw a lot of movies with him. And his voice is easy to recognize. So when Owen speaks I always notice that. The thought of that doesn't go and just sits there. As the movie was playing further, it started to feel more catchy. I liked the cat that played there and the relationship between dog and the cat and dogs with other dogs. Frankly I didn't care much about humans. Why? because they are the second main actors in this and all the other movies. I wanted something new and instead it's basically the same plot just with better animation. I didn't really like the main dog character Marmaduke. It just didn't catch me. For kids Marmaduke will be fine, but it wasn't for me. Honestly I liked the cat more and the rescue dog. She caught more of my attention. And I don't think that was only because Marmaduke was always goofing around like other dogs in other movies. As it hit the point in the movie where Marmaduke met the other dogs, I felt like giving it 3-4 stars. And finally the drama moment. There must be one. Just like in every other movie. Well, that made me like the movie even more. And that was when I agreed with myself on giving it 5 stars. I'm not greedy, the movie was done well, just not entirely original. Therefore I still gave it 5 stars.",1307664000,2,1669,4.301587301587301
4028224,3,B002ZG98DM,"Talking-animal comedies, without the excitement of spy and action themes, tend to be recycled from each other, spinning off from Alvin & The Chipmunks, Garfield, and others. This one is no different, spinning off from a comic book strip and trying to sell the adult audience with the voice cast of Owen Wilson, George Lopez, Fergie, and many more. As the latest integration into this genre, it certainly has flaws, but there is some positive notice in the field as well.

The film sees Marmaduke (Wilson) and his cat-friend Carlos (Lopez) moving to Los Angeles with their typical family after the dad gets a job for a pet food company. As usual, Marmaduke accidentally interrupts family business, because of his unusual size. Trying to fit in, is another story. However, he does make friends with as they call ""outsiders"", Mazie (Emma Stone), Giuseppe (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Raisin (Steve Coogan). However, Marmaduke gets constantly picked on by the higher dogs and develops a crush on the popular girl dog Jezebel (Fergie). Marmaduke then pretends to become a tough dog and wins a surfing contest, and after he's popular, he takes Jezebel on a date and throws a party at his house. However, his rival Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland), later finds out about Marmaduke's lie and exposes him. His temporary friends leave, and after the family comes home to the mess, he is locked outside. Saddened, the great dane runs away from home. The next day, Mazie finds him, but the cocker spaniel falls into a water main-break and Marmaduke comes to her rescue, and the dad comes to Marmaduke's rescue. The rescue was filmed on YouTube, and it causes the dad to get a major promotion. Marmaduke finally found his place in the world, and regained the friends he once temporarily had.

There's plenty to like about this film. Important messages on friendship, truth, and being yourself appear frequently, and its' heart appears to be in the right place as well. However, there's also stuff to dislike. Marmaduke is designed very oddly, and at times is very annoying. There is quite a bunch of gross humor, and the story is very simple, making the film look a bit cheesy and people can tell it is recycled from films such as Alvin and the Chipmunks, Garfield, Scooby-Doo and Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Altogether, if  you're looking for a family movie, Marmaduke wouldn't be the ideal choice, but kids who like over-humorous animal comedies will definitely find this flick likable, but parents might be more on the annoying side.",1306540800,,2515,4.92688679245283
4028225,1,B002ZG98DM,"Before I review this film I want to state for the record that I do like smart family friendly films(I happen to love the comic strip Marmaduke also), but unlike Alvin and the Chipmunks or How to Train your Dragon, this film is just one bad joke after another. I'm sure the really little kids will find something to laugh about here and parents may like the film because their kids like it, but for everyone else this film is boring with very little humor.

The film starts and ends with a dog F A R T joke(ha-ha very funny)! This isn't as bad as the two Chihuahua movies, but it isn't so much better than I can give it above a 1 1/2 star rating......probably 2 1/2 stars for very young children, but there are so many better films to introduce your children to.

4028356,3,B002ZG98DM,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Since I'm a big dog lover (and I loved 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua'), I had great expectations for 'Marmaduke'. It's based on a well-known comic strip but isn't as intense as 'Chihuahua'. The plot focuses on Phil, a marketing consultant, who moves his family from Kansas to Orange County, California after being hired by Don Twombly (William H. Macy), owner of Bark Organics, a new age pet food company. Phil owns the star of the film, a Great Dane named Marmaduke (who speaks to the film audience but cannot be heard by the characters in the film). Marmaduke the film is less sophisticated than 'Chihuahua' since its human antagonist, Twombly, is a wacky passive-aggressive type as opposed to the more realistic, sinister gang member/dog napper in Beverly Hills Chihuahua (BHC).

  Just like in BHC, Marmaduke, our dog protagonist, is opposed by an aggressive and intimidating canine, Bosco (a Beauceron). Phil's internal arc is linked to Marmaduke's as they both make the mistake of becoming social climbers and turn their back on family and friends. In Phil's case, he comes up with an ad campaign involving a dog surfing contest, designed to attract Petco as a possible buyer of Bark Organic pet food. Phil becomes so involved in his job that he doesn't pay enough attention to his children.

  Meanwhile, Marmaduke is trying to impress Bosco's girlfriend, a beautiful collie named Jezebel, by staging a fight with his cat friend, Carlos, at a dog park (George Lopez voices Carlos and also can be heard as a canine sidekick in BHC). Soon afterward, Marmaduke wins the dog surfing contest but alienates the Petco executives when he gets into a fight with Bosco.

  Things only get worse for the human and dog protagonists. Marmaduke's mixed breed friends which include Mazie (who jealously watches from afar when Marmaduke goes on a 'dream date' with Jezebel) Raisin, a brainy Dachshund with an English accent and Giuseppe, a fearful Chinese crested pooch, boycott the party he throws for the pedigree dogs from the dog park. After Bosco exposes the link between Carlos and Marmaduke, the uppity pedigree dogs led by Bosco, trash Phil's house and leave Marmaduke with a shattered ego. Crushed by the rejection by those who he considered his friends, Marmaduke runs off to the woods where he meets a dog in the wild, Chupadogra, an old English Mastiff who is reputed to have killed his owner.

  Chupadogra reinforces the theme of the movie: never judge a book by its cover. Chupadogra, in actuality, was the leader of a pack of strays who abandoned him. He's not as scary once you get to know him and ends up saving Marmaduke by chasing off a rather unpleasant dog catcher. Meanwhile, Phil returns from his work/vacation and promptly drops his laptop in the backyard pool which contains his final ad campaign to woo Petco.

  Phil finally realizes that he has betrayed his values and tells Don he can't attend the big meeting with Petco since he has to find the lost Marmaduke. In a dramatic denouement, Phil saves Marmaduke from drowning after he falls into a rainwater conduit and is swept away by raging waters. Marmaduke too sees the light by returning to the dog park, speaks out against prejudice (he argues mixed breeds are just as good as pedigrees) and wins over all the dogs, except for Bosco who exits, vowing revenge.

  Unlike BHC, where I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes, 'Marmaduke' will not have you rolling on the floor. A lot of the jokes are pretty corny (especially the bit about Marmaduke farting). Nonetheless, at its core, 'Marmaduke' has a positive message in its rejection of careerism and the need for tolerance between people who come from diverse backgrounds.",1291939200,,3742,4.861417322834646

PRODUCER:  I've got a project that's gonna blow your socks off!
E:  Great.  Let's hear it.
P:  You ready?
E:  Ready.
P:  Okay.  One word... Marmaduke!
(There's a long silence.)
E:  (puzzled)  Marmaduke?
P:  You know, the comic strip.  Marmaduke.  He's a huge Great Dane or something.  A dog.
E:  Someone's actually still drawing that?
P:  Don't you read the L.A. Times?
E:  That strip was never funny.
P:  Are you serious?  I love Marmaduke!
E:  I love cheesecake.  But there's no movie there.
P:  It'll be great.
E:  So, what's the take?
P:  First off, you make the big palooka talk.
E:  Like Garfield.
P:  You're with me on this.
E:  ""Garfield"" tanked... And it was a major embarrassment for Bill Murray.
P:  Who needs an old fart like Bill Murray?  We'll get someone really hip do the voice.  Y'know, like an Owen Wilson.
E:  He's not still suicidal, is he?
P:  ""Marley and Me"" fixed all that.
E:  That was a dog picture.
P:  Exactly!
E:  But the dog didn't talk.
P:  But Marmaduke does.  And so does his cat sidekick... Carlos--
E:  There's a cat in the comic strip?
P:  No.  But there will be in the movie.  Someone smart alecky can do his voice, like a George Lopez.  Pull in the ethnic crowd.
E:  He's not funny, either.
P:  Throw in some low-cost actors... William H. Macy's with my agency.
E:  Bill Macy would never do ""Marmaduke"".
P:  You got doggie fart jokes, doggie pee jokes.  I'm telling you, the kids'll eat it up.
E:  Kids don't know from Marmaduke.
P:  You make him like a supercool high school slacker, see.  And his family moves from Kansas to California.  Set it in the O.C., like the TV show.
E:  Uh, that's been off the air like five years.
P:  And in the O.C., Marmaduke discovers you've got your pedigrees and you've got your mutts.  And they hate each other.
E:  And they all talk.
P:  Of course they all talk.  And Marmaduke's this outsider and has to win `em all over.  He falls in love, throws a blow-out party while the family's out.  And here's the best part... Marmaduke surfs!
(Another long silence.)
E:  And that's supposed to be funny?
P:  The kids'll eat it up!
E:  I don't think it's for us.
P: (desperate)  But it's MARMADUKE!!!
E:  Listen, maybe you should take it over to Fox.  They did Garfield, Alvin, Space Chimps... They love talking animals over there.
