The illustration of the human-canine bond is poignant and heart warming.",1238716800,4,247,4.767441860465116
3566550,5,B001FAXM1I,"I just had the chance to watch Harris Done's heart-warming documentary about the dogs that aided U.S. Marines in the Pacific during WWII. This is a story that you never learned in school and as far as I know has never been optioned by Hollywood, but it is true: during WWII, families from all over the U.S. donated their dogs to the Marine Corps and the men they were assigned to became their new masters as they helped sniff out danger in the jungle. Done has compiled some great photographs and wonderful interviews with many of the Marines who are still alive and who still tear up speaking about their old furry friends, whom, in many case, saved their lives more than 60 years ago. I'm so glad somebody finally told these stories, as we lose WWII veterans daily and it is so important to have these often-overlooked aspects of the war documented. This is one of those rare, beautiful stories that tugs at your heart strings and educates at the same time and so I recommend it to teachers, students, war buffs, veterans and especially dog lovers! You'll never look at a doberman the same way, again!",1230854400,,1103,4.575757575757576

3566555,5,B001FAXM1I,"War Dogs of the Pacific is a film about a little known aspect of WWII - dogs donated from everyday people for the war effort. As told through the eyes of the soldiers who ate, slept and trained with these dogs 24 hours a day and then deployed with them, it is both poignant and uplifting at the same time. These dogs were Marines and were treated as such - this is a 5 tissue film - a must for WWII buffs and dog owners alike.",1224720000,10,426,3.9651162790697674

Words can't do justice to the bonds that were formed between these tough Marines and their loyal and courageous canine partners.

The documentary is very heartfelt, and it shows the history and the tradition of the training of the dogs, and the closeness that the handlers developed while working with them in-country. I can speak from first hand experiance that the Marine dog handlers today are no differant than the Marine Dog handlers in this documentary. Without a doubt this film gets 5 stars!!

3566596,4,B001FAXM1I,"This documentary summarizes the story of the MArine war dog platoon in WWII and their actions in the Pacific Theater, from the first days of early training to the actual experience in conflict. We see surviving veterans, including Dr William Putney, DVM- the first vet/head of the platoon- discuss their memories of the war and the dogs that served alongside them. I watched this documentary on the Military Channel, and then promptly ordered my copy of the DVD. As a dog lover myself, I can attest to the incredible love and loyalty that grows between a dog and his human companion. I can imagine how deep and strong that bond can be between a young soldier, far from home and probably frightened and lonely, and the dog that he has been assigned to care for during a war when so many other human emotions fall to the wayside. The dogs clearly saved many lives, and were invaluable to the soldiers in so many other ways. They were heroes too, and I can only applaud Dr. Putney's determined effort to see these dogs recognized for their service. Unfortunately the war dogs of Vietnam had no such advocate on their side, and countless numbers of them were left behind when Saigon fell.
I would also recommend that you read Dr. Putney's book - ""Always Faithful:A Memoir of the Marine Dogs of WWII"".  The book fleshes out some details, and many of the dogs and handlers mentioned in the book an be seen on the DVD",1260230400,2,1410,4.573122529644269

I have always been interested in the animal/human bond, and this DVD shined a light on some of the deepest emotional bonding I have ever seen. These men's lives depended on how well they understood their dogs' reactions to various events. The dogs, although trained for war, also provided companionship that gave a much needed respite from the incredible stress of the fighting in the Pacific.

I was also fascinated by the fact that these dogs were not trained only with compulsive methods, but that both positive reinforcement and praise were also used to teach the dogs what was expected of them.

The stories told by the veterans themselves are moving and powerful. It is a must see for any serious WW II buff, student and K-9 lovers. This is a great work and does an excellent job covering these forgotten men and their loyal dogs.

I think the people donating the dogs, this was the family pet not donated by breeders.  Unbelievable!  The photos of the dogs and their handlers were beautiful, black and white photos.  The dog of choice for the Marines was the Doberman. The dogs were very handsome and almost appeared to know exactly what they were doing and how they were helping the war effort.  Almost every dog came home.  To hear the marine handlers tell their story was great.  I felt sorry for the one marine handler who gave the dog back to the original owner and when the marine went and visted the dog the owner was annoyed. The dog lived out his life guarding a lot in a liquor store in Chicago.  Even the dog cemetary in Guam was very moving.

3566608,3,B001FAXM1I,"I purchased this video after reading about it in Dog World and the AKC Gazette. Its appeal lies in the live interviews with aging veterans about the dogs they handled in WWII and Vietnam. Most of the footage is taken from documentary filming by military photographers, something missing from more recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The story has pathos for dog lovers, especially concerning their exploits and casualties. It would have added to the ending if the details were given about the War Dog statue (a Doberman). I think one Arthur Haggerty was largely responsible, in addition to having a career as a writer and trainer of dogs for Hollywood movies. One drawback of this video is its brevity.",1241827200,7,703,4.866666666666666
