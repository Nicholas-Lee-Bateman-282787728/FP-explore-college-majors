5467302,5,B00APZDPPM,"These walking videos are wonderful.  I do like Volume 2 better than Volume 1, but Volume 1 is great too. I can't get out and walk so I step walk in front of my tv and also use arm exercises.  Sometimes I use my exercise bike.  These videos are very well done.  They also make me want to go to these places.  You can't go wrong with these videos.  I have several of these and want to add more to my collection.  I love them.  I use these every day.",1416960000,10,447,3.888888888888889
5467303,5,B00APZDPPM,"I put this in on the weekends and pretend I'm back in England, where I served in the Air Force.  Very nice and calming, until one of my cats heard the background sounds - cows, sheep, and, his favorite, birds.  He hopped up on the TV stand and nearly knocked the TV over trying to get to the chirping sound.  I had to stop I was laughing so hard.  Poor cat finally gave up, shot me a dirty look for teasing him, and I continued with my walk.
I especially like the touch of when the 'walker' goes through a gate along the public path, pauses and turns around to show the small plaque commemorating the marriage of Prince Charles to Lady Diana.
I will definitely get another from this company.",1398384000,14,691,4.251908396946565

8555844,5,B00APZDPPM,"Lovely stuff.  This is a cameraperson walking with a video camera, getting smooth Steadicam-style long continuous takes of pleasant villages with pretty gardens and cottages.  People occasionally wander into the camera's view, most seem to ignore the camera, and very few ever stare.  Occasionally, cars will pass; this is all just normal stuff you will see if you wander through this type of quiet scenic area.  And that's the charm of it--it's subtle and relaxing and unplanned.  The DVD is designed for treadmill-type exercise, but you may enjoy it as pure viewing, a refreshing change of pace from bombastic but empty Hollywood fare.  I liked what I read in the descriptions, and when the disc arrived, I immediately started watching it, and it was everything I hoped it might be.  This sort of thing has to be the viewer's ""cup of tea"" to be enjoyable, and it is certainly not mainstream fare.  The disc is a DVD-R, manufactured in short runs very likely at the filmmaker's home studio.  That is exactly the appeal of this product--it is for viewers who like a little offbeat relaxation and are willing to go ""off the beaten path"" to find some.  A quiet joy.  A recommended purchase for those with an adventurous streak.",1462147200,9,1225,4.813397129186603

8555846,4,B00APZDPPM,"I enjoyed this on the treadmill. the pace is 2.7 mph. I set my tread to 1.5 elevation and it matched the camera pace.
In the dark of winter i will enjoy It more, right now Oregon looks just as green.
The birdsong track is too loud and too repetitive, I put on classical music.(plus wrong seasons for birds).it would be nice if the camera would scan more, like a real person walking. Also it would be great if the would trun around and walk back the same way, same walk different views.",1460592000,3,485,4.225806451612903

8555849,5,B00APZDPPM,"Got this DVD - and it's companion - to watch as I exercise on the treadmill.
They're wonderful!
The video is of a simple walk through some beautiful English villages - no dialog - no soundtrack - just the ambient sounds of a quiet walk in beautiful surroundings. Makes an hour on the treadmill seem like only a moment.",1417219200,8,318,4.406779661016949
