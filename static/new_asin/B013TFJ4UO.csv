8728712,1,B013TFJ4UO,"Angry about the tabloid culture which celebrates it, the L.A. Slasher publicly abducts a series of reality TV stars, while the media and general public in turn begin to question if society is better off without them. That is a brief snippet from the description. Mine is this, if I had taken notice that this was Andy Dick, I would NEVER have gotten it. Biting Satire...not at all...I call it an aimless mess. BAdly shot, badly acted, awful story. Take my most heartfelt advice DON'T waste your time. Pure dreck!",1456185600,,512,4.7
8728713,1,B013TFJ4UO,"I love cheesy horror movies, and I had high hopes for this one. The opening credits are brilliantly animated and I was settling in for a fun time. Then unfortunately the movie started. This was a disaster from beginning to end. Mischa Barton is one of the worst actresses around, Eric Roberts appears for about 5 seconds, and even the comic relief from Danny Trejo and Dave Bautista was not even remotely funny. The editing was very choppy to the point of being extremely hard to watch, and there was no resolution to the story SPOILER - you never find out who the killer is (though the deleted scenes hinted at a major plot twist that I guess even this horrible director decided was too stupid).

A five star rating from someone because her son was in this should be reason enough to stay away. Don't say you weren't warned.",1451692800,,825,4.5
8728714,1,B013TFJ4UO,"No way are these reviews real. This movie is Terrible and not even in a so bad it's good kind of way. TRUST ME, do not waste your money. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen!",1449792000,2,183,3.972972972972973
8728715,5,B013TFJ4UO,"This is not your classic 5 star film and indeed some might consider it the worst film they ever saw. As a hater of the scripted reality TV shows, I appreciate someone creating dark irony over my contempt.

The plot is simple. Reality TV stars are being kidnapped and killed/abused. The killer seems to love Big Hair 80's music, and unfortunately they used too much faux 80's music, but I got the idea. A person who seeming loves the artificial aspect of the 80's that many older people loathed, goes on a crusade against people who are ""famous for being famous"" as he teaches them ""the price of fame."" While he is doing this, he is becoming famous, as we discover he has his own fan base who believes he is doing society a favor.

People who use ""totally"", Facebook, Twitter, and do Selfies are at risk. Reality TV is ""the birthplace of morons"" and ""doesn't count as acting."" There are reality star look-a-likes in this feature filled with dark humor. No one in the film has a name. They are simply known for the reason they are famous. The film doesn't center on anyone, but rather gives everyone a few minutes of character identification. We have no real background on the slasher and the end production credits doesn't identify the slasher, but IMDB does...as two different people, one for the body, another for the voice.

The film shows gallons of blood but no gore. You see the knife move and moments later there is blood. Seldom do you see the actual act of violence or close ups of wounds. No severed body parts.  It is not a slasher film that is ""gore-centric.""

Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. Background stripper nudity.  Eric Roberts playing  ""Clockwork Orange."" Again, this film is not for everybody.",1449360000,5,1707,4.632450331125828
