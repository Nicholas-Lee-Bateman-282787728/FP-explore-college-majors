5135250,1,B0087AOYG6,"This movie is slow, boring and down right one of the worst I have ever watched.  I started to turn it off after watching for a half hour but thought I give it a chance, but the more I watched the more I realize that there was no hope for this crap-o-la.  Do not waste your money on this tata!",1352505600,,292,3.85
5135251,2,B0087AOYG6,The best part of this movie is when the True Martial Artist is coming down out of the mountains and he does His Forms! can't say much for the rest of this movie. That one scene alone was worth my $2.99 $3.99 rental.,1352505600,,215,4.023255813953488
5135252,5,B0087AOYG6,"When is a sword not a sword?  That is a question asked by this film.  In a land of tradition (and traditional weapons), how does something new get added to the mix?  This interesting film tries to show some of the ways in which that question could be answered.  A good, off-beat look at a martial arts genre film.",1350518400,4,313,4.254237288135593
5135253,1,B0087AOYG6,"Not much action, the fight scenes were boring.  Bad Movie! I don't have anything good to say about it, it was one of the worst movies I have seen.",1348272000,,146,4.0344827586206895
5135254,3,B0087AOYG6,"Not bad movie, plot needs help, the Koreans are getting better at making movies.
Enjoyed the movie, but not at the top of my list.",1346889600,,130,4.24
5135255,3,B0087AOYG6,Well the trailer is what got my attention but the movie did not. It seems to be building up to something good. But then it was flat and slow Oh and boring. The action was dull. LionGate slipped on this one.,1346371200,,206,4.048780487804878
5135256,2,B0087AOYG6,"This is another Chinese film that had me scratching my head. The bad guys in this are the Japanese, who we never see. There is discussion and fighting among the various martial arts schools and the military as to what weapon and technique to use against the Japanese. A sword copied from the Japanese and altered in China is being promoted by one man, who is thought of as a Japanese pirate. Hence the title.

The movie appears to have some levity by design in an attempt to keep the action/drama from becoming too boring. However the foreign humor is well...foreign humor and only the slapstick aspect translates well.

The martial arts aspect of the film is stressed in some minor fighting hints in a technique the old master calls, ""Shadow and Sound."" The film appears to have some Chinese cultural appeaL that is not universal unless the theme is pirating from foreign countries is okay for the defense of the nation. The fighting is minimal and even the women who dress in red, found it boring. I had a hard time developing an interest in the plot.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. There are some scenes which imply sex is about to happen which is part of the levity.",1345852800,2,1184,4.5754716981132075

5135267,1,B0087AOYG6,"This is a B-movie with laughable fighting scenes. All I can see is the weapons touch one another and then some of the fighters falling down! Or in many cases, I hear only the sound of weapons hitting one another, then some of the fighters are dead. Yuk! It's really bad.

The flow is choppy. It clearly shows poor editing and directing. The acting is below average.

In short, It has NO IDENTITY. There is nothing worth seeing here.",1413331200,,432,4.455696202531645
5135268,1,B0087AOYG6,It doesnt have a nice plot. The action is done in a very low form of martial arts.  Im frustrated,1412121600,,97,3.85

5135274,3,B0087AOYG6,The beginning and the middle of the movie was good. I would've preferred a better ending then what was shown. That climax fight scene with the two masters did not live up to par.,1406246400,,178,4.264705882352941
5135275,3,B0087AOYG6,"That sword every identified.

A slow, but good movie.  Sometimes funny....if you don't understand subtle humor, don't watch it and expect to laugh out loud.

If you can't find a ""great"" movie to watch, watch this one, you will enjoy it.",1395705600,,236,4.7073170731707314
5135276,4,B0087AOYG6,"This movie is about two Japanese ""pirates"" who are in China, one of which wants to show the superiority of the Japanese sword and the technique of using it.  This sword is much longer than a Katana, and is not curved as a Katana is.  One of the men is captured, but the other is boxed in and forced to fight a very subtle fight to stay alive.  There is much intrigue and mystery involved in this very well made movie.  Fully enjoyable.",1394323200,,435,4.204819277108434
5135277,2,B0087AOYG6,"I did not like it. too slow, pretty boring, nedded more sword fighting.i saw three quarters of it had to stop watching.",1379808000,,119,4.454545454545454
5135278,3,B0087AOYG6,"Very good acting, action when it was needed. The master fighters (the two who fought it out in the end) were very skillful. They brought the story together in the end. It was in a way too drawn out. The same story could have been shorter with more skills performed by the main fighters to build up to the climatic duel. The better kung fu movies show more of the skills of the main actors before their final fight. I think there should have been more action in the movie because it was really rather slow.",1376265600,,505,4.270833333333333
5135279,5,B0087AOYG6,An deeply philosophical take on marital arts. Not your usual fare.  Prepare for a martial film that's not focused on fights but ideas,1373155200,2,133,4.782608695652174
5135280,5,B0087AOYG6,"Great Insightful Martial Arts Movie.  It's NOT the typical Wire-Fu, CGI'd extravaganza.  The pacing may seem a little slow, but it's Not a ""Chop-Socky"" movie.  Martial artists (particularly practitioners of Internal Martial Arts trained in Combat Usage) will appreciate it.  This film is a bit more philosophical than most.",1370908800,,323,5.530612244897959
5135281,5,B0087AOYG6,"If you're a mouth-breather, only find nonstop blood and gore entertaining or can't follow a plot that contains subtle humor then this movie isn't for you.
The fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed and filmed. They manage to be realistic - it isn't all wirework, flying swords and CGI. The affection that develops
between the rather endearing protagonist and the prostitute he hired is sweet and not overdone. There are allusions to sex but no nudity or cursing anywhere in the film.
I found it to be a charming film that develops slowly with the added bonus of an incredible soundtrack.",1364256000,,591,4.92
5135282,4,B0087AOYG6,i think this movie was very likable especiall the devotion and love that they had for each other and the action was very good the sceney was good for chinese film there was so much luv and this movie instead of major killing and heads rolling and blood everywhere that for once i enjoyed kung fu just for kung fu the bad guy was very good at being bad and evil good movie,1360713600,,371,4.095890410958904
5135283,4,B0087AOYG6,the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad,1355097600,,202,4.342105263157895
5135284,5,B0087AOYG6,"It is fight night in china town when you watch this movie, plenty of fight scenes

5135285,3,B0087AOYG6,"Interestingly told story that could be much better with out the ""humor"". Watch it if your are into more off beat ways of telling wuxia stories.",1353715200,,143,4.538461538461538
5135286,1,B0087AOYG6,What a great disappointment!  This is one of the those movies where the trailer is the best part of this movie.  The story line is poor.  The action scenes are poor.  If this movie were FREE I wouldn't recommend it.,1353024000,,215,4.3
8525964,1,B0087AOYG6,"This one was a disappointment, it started out good, but the end was just jousting with the opponent. For the ending, it should have been done in a school type setting. It was all and little action.",1486339200,,197,4.351351351351352
8525965,3,B0087AOYG6,ok,1485475200,,2,2.0
8525966,5,B0087AOYG6,what does it mean to be a martial arts master?  how is he different from the average practioner?  how does a sect gain acceptance despite irrational rejection by the mainstream?  can martial arts ever be understood only from a practical perspective without regard for cultural context?  this film tries to answer these questions instead of pandering to our expectations of what a good story is.  instead the plot is subservient to the goal of answering some important questions.  the filmmaker intentionally obscures the story in order to drive his point home.  yet the battles settings and weapons are treated with a degree of authenticity never seen in the martial arts genre.,1482364800,,678,5.054054054054054
