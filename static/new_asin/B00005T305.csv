7953473,4,B00005T305,This  movie is a great deal of wholesome sci-fi FUN! A good movie to watch for its impressive special effects. It doesn't require a good deal of thinking and analyzing. Just enough to be an interesting sci-fi THRILLER you can enjoy with home-made popcorn!!,1360195200,,256,4.818181818181818

7953475,3,B00005T305,"This film is based on a book by Ben Mezrich called ""Reaper.""  As with the film, I found its biggest flaw is the credibility of a computer virus being able to kill humans.  Neither the book nor the movie explains just how this deadly computer bug is able to do what it does to humans.
On the whole, the movie version is faithful to the book and offers some adequate chills, especially when the virus takes its effects.  Antonio Sabato, wearing more than his usual underwear ads, is effective, although not quite impassioned enough; Janine Turner bats her eyes well, but doesn't seem to have the heart of a true virus hunter; Robert Wagner plays a sleazy villain quite well; and Armand Mastroianni's direction is well paced.
Not a great film, but it does have its moments and makes you wonder how far we can go with computers?",1078012800,3,824,4.554054054054054
