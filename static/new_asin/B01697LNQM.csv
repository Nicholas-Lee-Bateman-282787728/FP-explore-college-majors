7464373,5,B01697LNQM,"This is the Tracy Anderson Dance Cardio DVD I have been waiting for.  I have been practicing her method for years, and, while I'm not coordinated enough for her complicated routines, I get bored by the easy ones.  This video hits the sweet spot between simple and complicated.  Thank you Tracy!!!!! <3",1453507200,14,301,4.75
7464374,5,B01697LNQM,"Love this cardio DVD. very fun and easy to follow along. Clear instructions too. Tracy's workout routines have made a huge difference on shaping my body that I had never thought it was possible. I continue to be amazed by the moves she came up with and they really work. Thanks, Tracy.",1452902400,2,285,4.5
7464375,4,B01697LNQM,"as a super dedicated practitioner of the TA method for 4+ years and a huge believer in Tracy's general message (often misrepresented in media and I don't blame those who are critical - just sayin') I buy whatever she puts out regardless of my needs. I subscribe to the weekly streaming classes and do those daily to the letter but unnlike most I'm actually partial to the Dance Cardio aspect of her method.

An important note is that TA is big on keeping your brain involved in the workout. The benefits of this are def. real. Not a problem with her leg series because it's always a mental challenge and staying precise never gets easy. But DC (dance cardio) routines become second nature, muscle memory kicks in and the benefits of what you're doing drop not to mention susceptibility to injury from repetitive motion. Thus I am ALWAYS psyched for a new set of movements , regardless of skill level. (for example I love doing the beginner cardio dvd when i'm bored at home or my knee doesn't feel like jumping - thats another MUST BUY for anyone interested in TA)

I was super impressed with the content of this dvd for a couple reasons
1. 6 10min routines are perfect!
2. production quality is great. zoomed in close, great detail. This is crucial for proper functional movement.
3. I am so used to watching TA from behind (streaming) so I've been dying to see somme of these exact moves from the front to make sure I'm moving properly. I noticed she uses the foundation moves to a lot of the 45min cardio routines in her studio and blends them together in a nice little package.
4. Every round of videos seems to find Tracy a bit more comfortable with being on camera. I admire this improvement greatly. She cares a LOT about providing a very precise pefect product to her audience and this effort proves that. She's totally having fun, dancing with you the whole time (you can hear her getting winded on the mic) and has found a cheerful groove in the talking-while-dancing department. big diff from perfect design series! no voiceovers here, shes right with you.
5. if you're a bit more advanced and 10min ain't cuttin it, the sections blend seamlessly and zero downtime so I loved that I could go for 30min or an hour and not have to stop and change gears.

** I hate not giving my beloved tracy 5 stars but i can't lie. the music bothered the crap out of me. I spend a lot of time making my own mixes to play over my regular streaming cardio, I purchased the dvd to not have to do that. Music on slim&sculpt cardio was much better. I know tracy is a music FIEND so it must be a licensing thing. I would love a ""just tracy's voice"" option like the meta dvd's.",1452211200,40,2665,4.4346938775510205
7464376,5,B01697LNQM,"I love how this one is taught in a build/add on method!  These are 6 intense 10 minute workouts/dance routines that include jumping jacks, twists, turns, and choreographed Tracy-style dancing - if you thought PopStar or the other longer dance cardio were too hard to ""get"" this is a great starting point to build up the intensity of your dance workouts because you can start with 10 minutes, then go to 20 etc. Even the full hour is do-able because of the less intense warm-up and cool-down stretching that starts and ends each 10 minute dance segment - so throughout the full hour (if you do all 6 or work up to that) you are getting some time to catch your breath. I also love it because on time crunch days you can still get a quick, intense burst of dancing.  Hope Tracy makes more like this one!  It took me a long time to learn Popstar and get the full workout, but I was able to get this full hour down the 1st time (despite the more choreographed Tracy style dance routines) because she teaches in a build on method as you go along in each separate segment.  Fun and great workout!",1452124800,24,1089,4.349753694581281

7464378,1,B01697LNQM,terrible work out no dancing and very poor instructions goes way to fast,1484784000,,72,4.615384615384615
7464379,5,B01697LNQM,"I started the method about 5 months ago and didn't like the cardio routine that came with it. so I went to search for a good but fun cardio routine, I came and found free Tracy Anderson beginner routine and loved it. I started to get bored with it and wanted something different and I went and bought this DVD. First, I am not a professional dancer nor do I have experience in dancing aside of couple month doing the free videos ( which took me a while to do ) but, this DVD is very easy to follow and the instructions are very clear at the start you will want to do the first dance couple times  till you get it, but it truly not complicated but then you get to the second dance it took me more than couple times to get it but I still very enjoyed the routine and the challenge. now I have the DVD maybe couple months,  I don't do it every day but I find it much easier to follow each dance routine as My brain got trained. It really fun and my motto is that workout always should be something you enjoy not a task. i really recommend this for a fun, brain challenged but not only. definatlly will try her other DVD'S.",1484611200,,1119,4.0588235294117645
7464380,2,B01697LNQM,"Tracy doesn't explain the moves well, she goes right into the routine and it is very hard to follow along.  Since these are quick 10 minute routines, it seems that half the time is spent trying to figure out the moves.  She will also throw in some new moves throughout the duration of the routine which is further confusing.",1484006400,,324,4.47457627118644
7464381,3,B01697LNQM,"Tracy has been a magnificent part of my life for years.  All her DVD 's have been clear and enjoyable.  However, the graphics on this one are clear for awhile, then have intermittent graphic 'hiccups.' This makes it annoying and difficult to comprehend all the dance steps. I reordered 3 times and no change...",1481760000,,310,4.722222222222222

7464383,5,B01697LNQM,"Great dvd. if you have been doing the Tracy dance cardio, the moves will come easy to you. It's 10 mins of dance, like in her meta cardio. at the end and beginning of each segment is stretching/arm workout.",1476144000,,206,4.3076923076923075

7464386,3,B01697LNQM,"I really like the 10 minute separate intervals. You can gradually add on to your work out.  The feel and quality  of the dvd ia a little 80's, but fun to exercise to.  I have other Tracy Anderson dvds and always enjoy working out to them.",1471392000,,238,4.130434782608695

7464388,1,B01697LNQM,"I think Tracy Anderson is great, but I didn't enjoy this at all.  Does it qualify as dancing?  Seems like moves I learned in Jazz class in the 80s when I was in elementary school.  If I want to watch bad dancing, I would go to a house party in the suburbs or prom.",1470096000,,264,3.8518518518518516
7464389,5,B01697LNQM,"Another great Dance Cardio DVD from Tracy Anderson. This DVD is great if you're working your way up to the more difficult, longer routines. It's also great if you just want a quick workout.",1469491200,,189,4.588235294117647

7464391,5,B01697LNQM,"I love this workout. The dance moves are engaging enough to keep away boredom,and the 10-minute segments are just right. A sweat-producing hour of cardio and fun dances -- what more could one ask for!",1466899200,,200,4.742857142857143
7464392,5,B01697LNQM,"I love the 10 min segments, I do a segment each day of at lest 10 mins, if I have time, I do more. Its the first think besides drink water that I do right after I wake up! Its a awesome way to start your day!",1465776000,,208,3.4468085106382977

7464394,3,B01697LNQM,"not my favorite Tracy video, and I am a big fan of hers. Ten minute segments just seem a little too short, and the production quality is not what you expect based on her newer videos. Still a good workout though.",1465171200,,212,4.195121951219512
7464395,5,B01697LNQM,"This DVD is in line with the Cardio for Beginners where Tracy walks you through steps ""live"" (no voice over! yay!). The steps are complicated but  a lot of fun to learn and challenging to keep you engaged and not mindlessly jumping around. I'm sure I do not look as graceful as Tracy, but I am having the same amount of fun. Her energy in this is infectious. One of her best.",1461888000,3,375,4.208333333333333

7464397,1,B01697LNQM,"Having done aerobics for 20 years, I was looking for a program that was challenging and well-cued.  Well-cued it is not.  If you're a dancer and like improv, maybe.  To me, it seemed as if she was making it up as she went along.  When routines were (what I thought) supposed to loop, the routine wasn't the same with each loop.  On the up-side, as a non-dancer I got an extra workout trying to catch-up to whatever Ms. Anderson's new uncued move was.",1459641600,3,450,4.373493975903615

7464399,4,B01697LNQM,"I love Tracy Anderson. I also like that each workout is 10 minutes, but I still think they are to jumpy. I love the bootcamp and beginner dance cardio.",1459209600,,151,4.241379310344827
7464400,3,B01697LNQM,"I have been collecting dance workout DVDs because I want to do exercise that doesn't feel like exercise. I thought this DVD would be a great addition to my collection. And while it did get me sweating, it felt like one long aerobics session. I also found the choreography in workout 5 too challenging for a beginner. Still, I will probably do this one on days I want to get in a hard workout because I believe it is effective.",1459036800,2,426,4.3375
7464401,4,B01697LNQM,"I'm not really enjoying this video that much.  I've watched all sessions on this video and it's too fast paced for me.  I have been enjoying the ""beginner"" videos, including the cardio dance for beginners.  I've been doing a combination of these videos for about 6 or 7 weeks now and still don't feel ready for this video.  But I know I have it when I'm ready for it.",1458518400,,367,4.27536231884058
7464402,2,B01697LNQM,It just wasn't for me.  I don't feel she took enough time building on each step so by the time she is cranking along...I'm all over the place. And the music was awful. I donated it to goodwill.,1458259200,,193,4.078947368421052

7464404,5,B01697LNQM,"(This is John's wife) I love this workout! I've been doing TA workouts since the birth of my second child, and it was the only thing that helped me lose weight and get toned without bulking up. I have restarted Metamorphosis after the birth of my 3rd child (amazing workout btw) and got this dance express video to switch up the meta cardio. Sweating head to to after the first 10 mins and I love that you can pick and choose the segments. The brief warmup and arm workout is a nice slowdown in between segments. Highly recommend!!",1455753600,9,531,4.428571428571429
7464405,5,B01697LNQM,This was great.  The only thing that would make it better is if you could progam to do three at a time.  Can do all or just choose one at a time.  I love the different moves.  I have been doing TA method for a while now and love them.,1455494400,,234,3.62
7464406,3,B01697LNQM,"This is a nice change from Tracy's other cardio dance DVDs. However, it does not have a premix to do the routine straight through, minus the many warm ups/cool downs, and instruction. Since all her other dance cardios are like that, I am flabbergasted that she did not offer this. Plus her warm up is mainly doing arm routines. Now that would have been another nice premix, if that's all you wanted. You can never have enough of Tracy's arms. So I now have to stop moving to fast forward, or move in place while doing the arm exercises. A real pain!
So this is the reason I am giving it 3 stars. If she had done a premix for just the cardio, I would have given it a 5.",1454889600,6,668,4.1461538461538465
7464407,5,B01697LNQM,I love to dance and Tracy makes it so much fun and easy.  LOVE HER! After 2 babies she's the only workout that really transformed my body and it looks better than before being pregnant!,1454284800,,185,4.285714285714286
8735942,1,B01697LNQM,"Does laughter count as cardio? If so, I may be at my goal weight from just 10 minutes of this. I understand now why she does her videos solo. It seems like she's making up the moves as she goes. Skip the DVD, do some jumping jacks, kick your legs out to the sides, hop around like an idiot and BAM ! you're done. I couldn't stop laughing. Actually, if you want to cheer someone up, pop in this DVD and let them watch you do it. You'll both be in stitches. Ok, seriously some of her other DVDs are OK but I don't consider this dancing. It seems like a first grader can come up with a better routine.",1515024000,2,598,3.9916666666666667
8735943,4,B01697LNQM,I got this to fill in on those days that I am not able to get to the gym. It is easy to follow and has enough intensity to give me a decent work-out.,1508716800,,149,3.411764705882353

8735945,1,B01697LNQM,"She's pretty and has a great body...that's where it ends.  She starts her moves, AND THEN gives instruction.  That makes her video very difficult to follow.  It may be hard to give better instructions for the choreography she has in a 10 minute timeframe, so may have been better for her to follow the KISS principle.  Frustrating, and obvious she is more of a ""pretty face"" than an ""instructor"".  At the price of this video you can judge for yourself, as it's less than the cost of one class at a typical studio.",1500854400,,513,4.473118279569892
8735946,4,B01697LNQM,"This TA DVD is different from any other I've tried. It has 6 ten minute sections. It's nice cause you choose where you want to start. The routine is easy, so it can get boring after awhile. Tracy talks you thru the steps, which is different from her other DVDs",1498176000,,260,4.22
8735947,1,B01697LNQM,Love it!! prefect way to get in just how much cardio you want or have time for. fun and much better than the meta cardio!!,1497744000,,122,3.92

8735949,2,B01697LNQM,Her pack of cueing makes me crazy. The music is no fun. I usually end up just doing my own thing. If you have your own music playing and watch her it's  tolerable.,1494892800,,163,3.9393939393939394
8735950,1,B01697LNQM,"I am not familiar with TA. I was looking for a fun workout. I turned on DVD, got ready... and proceeded to do 10 minutes of jumping jacks. At about 5 min I told myself to give up, but I am not a quitter, so I jumped some more. When she did that weird head move, I finally realized my sense of direction is non existent, I gave up. I am not particularly good at dance work outs, but I wouldn't call this one a dance workout. It's just a woman doing lots of jumping jacks turning left and right! She is hard to follow because it's just her moving and she talks very little, and a lot of time she is shown from side view so it kind of throws you off. I turned on beach body and actually did a workout.
Sorry TA, not my style.",1485820800,4,722,3.885135135135135
