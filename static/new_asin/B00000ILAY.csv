7910667,4,B00000ILAY,"EAT YOUR HEART OUT manages to do what few movies in this summer's theater spectrum are able to do - entertain with a well cast, tautly directed, romantic yet clever bit of welcome fluff.  Though this film dates back to 1997 it stands up well in comparison to other films in this genre. It is  a classy little act!

Daniel Haus (the very handsome German actor Christian Oliver) is a gifted chef whose dream is to write a cookbook.  Out of monetary necessity he shares a loft with artist Samantha (Pamela Segall) and ropy friend Peter (John Craig) who has many issues with relationships.  When good fortune befalls Daniel in the guise of a TV Cooking/Lovelorn show run by Kathryn (the vastly under-used Linda Hunt) and agent Jaqueline (a miscast Laura San Giacomo from 'Pretty Woman' fame), his life and perception of his friends changes.  He is dressed, groomed, and bedded by Jaqueline to the point that his friends barely recognize him.  Daniel's ongoing family problems also disrupt his life until finally his father's illness alters his outlook and he rearranges his priorities.  How that is accomplished and the results these surprises have on all involved form the end of the story.

The nice thing about EAT YOUR HEART OUT is that it never takes itself seriously: there are no ominous overtones to the everyday problems many of us face, just realistic resolutions. The entire cast is quite good with especial attention to Pamela Segall and Christian Oliver.  The direction by Felix O. Adlon (""Salmonberries') is sensitive and well paced and a nod goes to the fine editing of Dan Lebental.  Definitely worth viewing for a warm summer evening's pleasant entertainment.

7910668,3,B00000ILAY,"I rented this movie and enjoyed every moment that I saw her.
I myself have been always involved in movies and someday I would like to act.  I am currently under the study of John Casablancas Modeling and Acting Career Centers.  This movie is fun to watch really and I suggest that another one of her movies should make it to DVD.  The name of this movie is called Something Special.
I am sure all you Pamela Segall fans know this one.
Encourage her movies to make it on DVD especially Something Special.",1075680000,,503,4.387096774193548
7910669,4,B00000ILAY,"Daniel is an aspiring young gourmet chef with a knck for landing just about any girl he sets his sights on with his amazing meals.  He lives with his friend, Samantha, an aspiring young artist/tomboy/mechanic.  Samantha is the perfect friend, always supportive - in Danny's career, his love-life troubles, his problems with his disapproving father - and there's no worry about romantic entanglements, right?  Wrong!  Suddenly, just as Sam begins to realize just how much Daniel means to her, Daniel is swept away by success.  He lands a job as the chef on a gourmet coooking show.  His success climbs as he dispenses advice to the love lorn while cooking gourmet dishes for two.  As Daniel begins to become more famous, he begins to be pulled away from the people he cares about and gets swept up in the fame and fortune of television.  All the while, his dreams of writing a cookbook are put on the back-burner.  While Sam struggles to get over him, Daniel realizes how much he misses her and the simpleness of his former life.
This movie has all the flair of an independent film.  I happen to enjoy independent film, because those involved are willing to take chances.  They don't hold to the regualr constraints of film genre.  Don't get me wrong - this is definitely a feel good movie in the style of Some Kind Of Wonderful, but done in a different , more modern style.  Great performances by Christian Oliver and Pamela Segall.  I think Pamela Segall doesn't get the respect due her acting skill!  She definitely deserves more attention!  And before you think that this film stars only up-and-coming actors, keep in mind that both Linda Hunt and Laura San Giacomo do an excellent service to this film.  A film definitely worth checking out.  Romantic fools like myself will just eat it up!",1029283200,4,1794,4.713826366559486
7910670,4,B00000ILAY,"Hey, there's a phrase you don't hear everyday - longtime Pamela Segall fan. But that's me. Any of you realize that the actress playing Samantha in this film is the voice of Bobby Hill on the animated series, KING OF THE HILL?
Pammy's a true vet of her industry. She's been acting for almost 20 years and she's only in her 30's! Watch her closely in this movie. She's great! She's almost always better than the material she's in. But I can't really say that about this movie because it's a gem! Most especially from my perspective, since I've enjoyed this actress's work for about 18 years (since FACTS OF LIFE if anyone remembers) and it gives her such a nice, juicy, leading part.
I also can't knock the movie because I know it came from the heart. As a struggling screenwriter, I really respect that.
And finally, I gotta give mad props to the writer/director, Felix Adlon because Pammy's name nowadays is officially Pamela Segall-Adlon.
Sorta adds a new dimension to the experience of watching this sweet little love story, doesn't it?",999043200,,1038,4.6775956284153
7910671,5,B00000ILAY,"Although I viewed this movie the night I broke up with my girlfriend...it gave me a false sense of hope.  For it made me want to get up and get back together with her the next day.  However, that never happened, I DID enjoy the movie.  And that was good, for I would have shot myself if not for this movie.  The actors were terrific, very real, very Generation-X, the plot was touching and heart-warming, the cinematography was just as pleasing, and overall, it made even my dogs cry.  Maybe that's because they had to pee while I was glued to the screen.  Well, anyway, the movies rules, go out and get it, and I hope to see you in my melacholy hole sometime soon.",984355200,,665,4.28
7910672,5,B00000ILAY,"This was an excellent movie with an interesting plot and very good actors. Christian Oliver is just stealing every scene he is appearing at, and Laura San Giacomo gives a very convincing performance. The movie is very good to  watch while on a date. Definitely, two thumbs up!",944611200,5,276,4.75
