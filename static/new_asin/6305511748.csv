He finds amusement in his personal ""house band""...four beautiful rock and roll girls-in-a-cage who play on command. He's also a ""biological inventor.""

A very funny movie packed with suprises.  And the greatest part of all is that it is never explained exactly how they make people into dolls, but you still get to see it happen.
The oddest part of this movie is that the band in it is extremely similair to the metal-chick band Kitty.  Though it came out a year before the first Kitty CD.  And in Kitty's video for the first single Brackish, the girls were wardrobes that are the almost exactly the same as the girls in Blood dolls.  The hair is slightly changed, but holds the same basic style.
GET THIS MOVIE NOW!",994032000,,696,4.3307692307692305

I like bad moviesjust as much as the next guy, but come on.  this one is a rip off ofpuppet master (which is made by the same company).  I really thought there was a tiny story line, and even smaller plot.  The movie could have really been something.  I don't know what, but soomething.. The guy with the painted face was interesting....  END",954892800,,387,4.380281690140845
