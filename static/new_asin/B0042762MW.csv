The story starts out with a TV crew in a church/monastery filming some old bones that I assume belonged to a saint. They interview an old monk. Then the three main guys - Pedro Armendariz Jr., Andres Garcia and J.L. Rodriguez - who are monks at the monastery, get sent out into the 'real' world for some reason that I didn't quite grasp, but I think they're looking for something, or on some kind of a quest, maybe to achieve some measure of redemption..?

I'm not totally sure, but it gives them the opportunity to try booze, meet women and hang out in some super-groovy clubs and discotheques - and P. Armendariz even performs in one! He's one rockin' monk. Andres Garcia (aka 'El Macho Bionico') gets involved with pretty Claudia Islas, and at the end of the film - well, I don't want to give it away.

Anyway, great period feel and some odd humor. Plus, Andres Garcia is Dah Man (or El Hombre).",1304985600,,1098,4.45273631840796
