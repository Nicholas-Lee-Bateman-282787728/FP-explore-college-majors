2642010,4,B000HT3Q2S,"I would say that this is a very good box if you want to see great comedies of the 40's but don't mind having no extras. A simple calculation can reveal a very good price per unit (around 6$) and all the movies range from very good to masterpiece.

You have to like dialogues because this is what it's all about I wouldn't recommand Preston Sturges if you are the special effects and big action type. These kind of movies simply don't exist anymore but the witty screenplays still works and the stories of these movies are very original. Some scenes are a little over the top or too screwballish but it's not very disturbing considering the high level of writing and acting that we see. I would say that every movie is worth seeing which is often not the case (particulary these days) with other boxes, example the John Ford box which is half good or the Paul Newman box about the same thing. The transfers are quite good considering the price, it's not Criterion but for comedies that's quite okay. The only problem is that there is no extras not even chapters so don't even  expect audio commentaries or documentaries. That's why I left out a star, I would have paid 10 or 15$ more for some xtras.",1165795200,2,1198,4.4409090909090905
2642011,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Preston Sturges has always had a small following among film fans. That's too bad because he was probably one of the most brilliant writers and directors of his generation. His screwball comedies are brilliant examples of Hollywood filmmaking at their best. The first film I saw by Sturges at UCLA was ""Sullivan's Travels"" and from that point on nobody could compare to this maverick. This boxed set from Universal collects the rest of Sturges most important work (""Unfaithfully Yours"" and ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" are also available on DVD). Sturges reign at the top was brief but prolific; he produced most of his best films as a writer/director between 1940 and 1948 when he was at Paramount.

 Overall the films in the ""Preston Sturges Collection"" look quite good although ""The Great McGinty"" looks a bit gritty at times but still looks quite good.  Blacks are pretty solid and the condition of the prints look pretty good with Universal clearly putting digital clean up into some of these films. Keep in mind also that the source material varies in age with the oldest film here being 66 years old. ""Sullivan's Travels"" compares favorably to the Criterion edition although I'd suggest fans keep that edition since ""ST"" has no notable extras as part of the package. Audio sounds crisp and clear which is important as Sturges' verbal wit is almost as important as the slapstick comedic set pieces that decorate his films like icing on a cake.

 Although this isn't a special feature it is a trend in the right direction for Universal. Many of their ""tribute"" collections have had as many as five films crammed onto one dual layered dual sided disc. ""PSC"" keeps it to one film per disc which is a big plus preventing problems during the pressing process that plagued some of their previous releases for some fans.

Sadly all we get are five trailers for the films included. Universal should have ported over some of the Criterion material or, at the very least, put together an hour documentary on Sturges career. It would have been pretty simple to do so in collaboration with his estate which has a website up and running full of biographical and trivia information about the great director. Although I'm not a fan of ""Mad Wednesday"" Sturges last major film as a director/writer made with Harold Lloyd since it is in the public domain it might have behooved Universal to find a decent print or source element, clean it up and include it as an extra here as well. Commentary tracks would have been welcome as there are a number of bright scholars at UCLA, USC and NYU that would gladly have tackled that here. At the very least having a director that does comedy and appreciates Sturges (or that is stylistically similar) would be great. Although he's not the same type of comedy director Mel Brooks or Buck Henry would have provided great commentary tracks (as would Christopher Guest). Ah the world of missed opportunities. If only I ran Universal's vintage film division.

Keep in mind that three of the seven titles here have been released before two of them in superior editions by Criterion. Still, it's hard to argue with the price for this set. I'd suggest keeping your Criterion titles for the extras since Universal has been stingy with anything worthwhile here.

A collection of terrific films at a great price sans much in the way of extras appears celebrating one of the comedic masterminds of film direction from the 20th century. If Sturges hadn't come along film comedy would have been the poorer for it. His films have had a wide ranging impact on a variety of comedy writers/directors/actors through exposure in revival houses and television. This great collection of some classic (and one not so classic) Sturges films is worthwhile for fans. Between this, the Criterion releases and Paramount the bulk of his best material is available finally on DVD.

Synopsis of the film's plots below (whic don't do their comedy elements justice I might add).

Beginning with Sturges ""The Great McGinty"" with Brian Donlevy (who reprises the role briefly in ""Sullivan's Travels"" in an amusing cameo) is one of the best political satires of the era as well. Donlevy plays Daniel McGinty who rises to the top in politics due to his connections and the corruption of the political machine. McGinty eventually becomes Governor but along the way develops a conscience when he falls in love with the woman he married to help propel him to power. Its a brilliant, cynical and dark comedy that makes no apologies nor does it try and take the Capra's more sentimental optimism.

1940 was one of Sturges most prolific periods. He also wrote and directed ""Christmas in July"" with Dick Powell, Ellen Drew and Sturges regular William Demarest. Adapted from his own play Sturges ""Christmas in July"" is set during The Depression with Dick Powell playing Jimmy McDonald a nave character who keeps trying to make his big splash by winning $25,000 in a advertising contest for coffee. He believes he has won and he and girlfriend are offered promotions and become minor celebrities. Of course this is Sturges not Frank Capra so the wit is more cynical.

""The Lady Eve"" presented Sturges with a rare opportunity--he gets two top notch stars Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck who take to their comedic roles as if they were born to play them./ Jean Harrington (Stanwyck) just wants to land wealthy shy guy Charles Pike (Fonda) because of the money but ends up falling in love anyway but with a healthy dose of--yes--sly sarcasm at the heart of the film. It's not Sturges most accomplished as its clear the elements of the plot were used before for other screwball comedies but it's more about what Sturges does with the material than the material itself that matters here.

""Sullivan's Travels"" has always been my favorite film by Struges. Film director John Sullivan (A very funny Joel McCrea) has had it with making over-the-top comedies. He wants to make SERIOUS films about humanity's plight but has no clue how to as he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. So he becomes a hobo wandering the camps that are occupied by the disenfranchised. What he discovers though is that escape and hope are just as valuable as making films raising social issues. Veronica Lake plays his love interest and with her sweeping hair created a craze. It's brilliant, sarcastic, satirical and a moving drama all within the scope of a comedy. It's one of Sturges' outstanding achievements and definitely still one of the 100 Greatest Films of All Time.

McCrea appears again in ""The Palm Beach Story"" another of Sturges brilliant great screwball comedies that plays with the conventions of the genre. Tom and Gerry (Joel McCrea and Claudette Colbert) are up to their eyeballs in debt. Tom's an inventor with impractical creations. Gerry decides to leave him and find a rich beau John Hackensacker (Rudy Vallee) while Tom tries to collect his wife Hackensacker's sister Centimillia -what a name--(Mary Astor) FALLS for him. It's a rollicking screwball with some of the funniest sequences from any film. Although this wasn't my favorite Sturges comedy for a long time I've come to realize it's probably one of his best.

""The Great Moment"" is an odd drama/comedy focusing on a dentist/ inventor (McCrea again) who comes up with anaesthesia during the 19th century. The film chronicles the dentists attempts to protect his invention and profit from it while others push him to release its secret to the public for the greater good. Of course the greater good in this case is for a company to exploit the invention without paying him a penny. It's an odd film and very uneven. We'll never know what Sturges truly intended here as the film was taken away from him and recut by the studio prior to release. It's one of the few Sturges films that I hadn't seen before (I did catch portions of the film on TV though throughout the years but never saw the whole film) and it's not among his best but does have some sparkling passages in it. Needless to say audiences were a bit baffled at the time and the film flopped at the box office.

Finally we have Eddie Bracken as the lead in ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" the last film that Sturges made for Paramount. Bracken plays Woodrow a man who is forced to masquerade as a hero. Discharged from the military during World War II Woodrow never sees any action and hasn't told anyone back home that he is a civilian again. Convinced by a group of Marines to pretend he served he is greeted as a hero suddenly honored by his home town for his service. Again Sturges uses an absurd situation to act as both social critic and humorists roles that he was born to assume.",1165708800,60,8683,4.778666666666667
2642012,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Even with the 3 already-released-on-DVD titles, that still leaves four films for $41.  Still a great value in my mind.  Nothing else to add to the excellent reviews below.  Preston Sturges was a unique and great director, if you haven't had the pleasure, give these films a shot.",1164672000,2,279,4.770833333333333
2642013,5,B000HT3Q2S,"With this collection and the addition of ""The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek, which was released on DVD by Paramount last year, we have as complete a collection as we can expect from Universal. The mastering of ""The Palm Beach Story"" here rectifies a very disappointing job from Universal last year, and the new-to-DVD issues of ""The Great McGinty,"" ""The Great Moment,"" ""Christmas In July,"" and the film Sturges thought was his true masterpiece, ""Hail The Conquering Hero,"" make this release as good as it gets.  ""Unfaithfully Yours,"" a Fox picture, has been released on Criterion, and ""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""The Lady Eve"" are also Criterion issues.  I compared this new remastering of ""Sullivan"" with the Criterion, and despite a slightly to moderately better transfer--especially the soundtrack--from Criterion, Universal has held its own, quite an undertaking by itself against what has always been superior work by Criterion.

So to complete your collection, be sure to purchase ""Miracle,"" because it's the finest transfer of any of Sturges's films.  I, too, like another reviewer, would have appreciated a clean copy of ""The Sin Of Harold Diddlebock,"" also known as ""Mad Wednesday,"" as it has languished in the public domain for a long time.

Universal still doesn't believe in extras and that's a shame.  We could have used interviews, documentaries, scripts, and perhaps the many feet that were left on the cutting room floor for ""The Great Moment.""  I recommend the three Criterion Sturges films because of the extraordinary special features that are a hallmark of Criterion.  But, again, let's give appropriate credit to Universal for doing its best for us fans and Sturges's masterworks.  He pioneered the way for other writer-directors like Billy Wilder, and the appreciation of these films, with its witty satirical situations and urbane dialog, deserves to be passed along to the next film generation.  Sturges also accomplished something that we don't see very often today:  With Sturges, there's no such thing as a ""minor"" character; they all possess their own distinct personalities and help to create a complete story with each scene and sequence, supporting or balancing the other characters in the film.",1164585600,94,2220,5.242937853107344
2642014,4,B000HT3Q2S,"The comedies of Preston Sturges have never been equalled. They combine satire with episodes of character development that give them depth; slapstick humor with smart dialogue; and ensemble acting with deft cinematography that reward repeated viewings. While some of Sturges' films are rich in period detail, none of them are dated. They're just as funny (and some episodes just as moving) as when they were made, and there are no dull parts. Unfortunately, however, two of Sturges' best films are missing from this set - Unfaithfully Yours, and Miracle of Morgan's Creek. His underrated film starring Harold Lloyd, The Sin of Harold Diddleback (AKA Mad Wednesday) is also missing. A set that included all of these films would deserve not just five but six stars.",1164240000,3,762,5.104
2642015,3,B000HT3Q2S,"""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""The Lady Eve"" are currently available from Criterion (probably much better transfer quality) and ""The Palm Beach Story"" is currently available from Universal (not the best transfer), BUT I'm excited to get the other four....three of which are about as funny as many movie you'll ever see.

I recommend you to buy this, but Universal needs to stop with the double-dipping.

(for the record, ""The Lady Eve"" and ""The Palm Beach Story"" are also unbelievably funny...""Sullivan's Travels"" is a comedy-drama....the funny bits are histerical and the dramatic bits are very thoughtful.)",1163721600,12,603,5.404255319148936

2642057,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Preston Sturges wrote and directed eight of the funniest comedies ever made. Seven of them were for Paramount, between 1940-1944, and six are in this set.  (His eighth and final great film, Unfaithfully Yours, was made at 20th Century Fox.) Anyone who knows movies knows how uproarious the Hollywood satire Sullivan's Travels (a rich, idealistic filmmaker sets out to learn what it's like to be poor and succeeds beyond his wildest nightmares) and the romance of a con-woman Barbara Stanwyck and naive millionaire Henry Fonda in The Lady Eve are. If you haven't seen them, start there! Hail the Conquering Hero, a hilarious and (ironically) Capraesque look at hero-worship in wartime America, may be Sturges' masterpiece. A little-known gem is Christmas in July, a brilliant, fast-paced comedy about an inveterate contest-entrant (Dick Powell) who thinks he'll be a failure if he doesn't win the big prize - then is tricked into thinking he has won: scarcely more than an hour long, and just perfection. The marital mixup The Palm Beach Story (with the daffiest beginning and ending of all time) and the classic political spoof The Great McGinty round out the six. (The Great Moment has some laughs, but it's actually an offbeat biopic about the inventor of anesthesia). The only way this set could be better would be if it had included Sturges' 1944 comedy The Miracle of Morgan's Creek - for some reason it's not here.

2642078,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Amazon allowed me to ""steal"" this collection for $28, but even at the $40 price the package offers value because every film is a treasure.

I saw ""Palm Beach Story"" on TCM in 2012 and thought it ho-hum at the time - for some reason, the second viewing from this package was a lot funnier, a third perhaps even more outlandish.  Veronica Lake is still a knockout in ""Sullivan's Travels"" - it's hard to believe she was tending bar in New York in the 1960's.  The Great McGinty features a teriffic performance from an actress, Muriel Angelus, whose career unaccountably went nowhere afterward.  The only leading lady turning in what I thought was a stilted and ordinary performance -Betty Field in A Great Moment - had a viable career, appearing in such stellar pictures as The Great Gatsby, Bus Stop, Picnic, and Of Mice and Men.

The Great Moment is the most subtle of these Preston Sturgis works, couching its message in the far removed era of the 1840's to make its point about the human greed and the machinations that take place behind great medical advances, so the film never really goes out of date even as the object of discovery does.

Roger Ebert ranks The Lady Eve among the top film classics ever - that film alone sells for nearly $30 in the Criterion edition, so to have it here in this collection makes the package doubly noteworthy.  As an introduction to the work of Preston Sturgis or as a stand alone record of early 1940's film, this is a great addition to anyone's film library",1390608000,2,1497,4.563432835820896

2642085,4,B000HT3Q2S,"THE FILMMAKER COLLECTION is a fantastic resource if you want to see some great films from a very underappreciated film director. Preston Sturges was one of the great directors or is often forgotten in today's world. This set is a great start for all things Sturges. There are few eternal classics in this collection along with some obscure and forgotten films. Don't miss THE LADY EVE, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS or THE PALM BEACH STORY.

This is a nice collection but the sad thing is there basically are no extras. At best a film trailer is included but no additional information about Sturges or the many stars in his films or a background on the various stories.

These are rich with the top stars of the era - Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake and so on. There were a few actors that I knew little about such as Joel McCrea and Brian Donlevy. I was fascinated when I researched these actors and learned more about them. I had long heard of Veronica Lake and there she was a lovely and very petite lady playing a delightful sweet and spunky girl in SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS. The same character actors, such as William Demarest (Uncle Charlie from the TV Series MY THREE SONS), and others who appear throughtout the films. Demarest has big roles in several films.

I started with THE LADY EVE and it was fun to see a young Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck eluded a modest kind of sex appeal to Fonda's naive and oafish heir. I was expecting light-hearted romantic comedies but SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS took a darker turn as a famous film director decides to get to know the real suffering of Depression era America. In the GREAT McGINTY, we have the mob running city and state government. I am sure issues of the day were being addressed.

I enjoyed Joel McCrea in SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS and looked forward to THE GREAT MOMENT only to be totally disappointed in the film on all levels. William Demarest is here again in a main roll by the film is weak on all levels. It is a period piece with McCrea as the dentist who ""discovers"" pain free dentistry and experiments with it in a rather sill series of scenes. This is far from Sturges' best. I couldn't imagine a story about a man who discovers the medicinal uses of ether. It's a cross between drama, comedy and silliness.

Overall, this is a great collection. Before each movie starts, we have the modern UNIVERSAL STUDIOS logos and then on to the black and white film with the PARAMOUNT STUDIOS logo. I didn't see the connection with Universal Studios. The movies are nicely restored and look clean and crisp. The amazing disappointment is that there are no DVD extras to this fine collection.",1330905600,,2665,4.649681528662421
2642096,4,B000HT3Q2S,"Preston Sturges was one of the biggest creative stars of the 1940s in Hollywood (having worked as a screenwriter through the 1930s before getting the chance to direct his first film in 1940). Between 1940 and 1944, he directed and wrote eight films for Paramount, seven of which are contained in this box-set (""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"", one of the three films released in 1944, is absent).

1. The Great McGinty (C+)

This was Sturges' first film as a director, and it won him his only Oscar (for the screenplay). The rudiments for a good film are here (a homeless man becomes a crooked politician, then turns honest and gets taken down immediately), but it doesn't quite come together. At 82 minutes, it's too short to really cover all the terrain it tries to; events happen much too quickly and cursorily (McGinty's fall from grace takes about a minute). The tone is also problematic; it mostly tries to be dry political satire, but there are moments of outright farce and seriousness that seem out of place.

2. Christmas in July (B)

Despite being shorter (only 67 minutes), this feels more like a complete story. The leads are a bit more engaging. The movie is also a lot more tonally consistent. I should also say that while I didn't love the movie, there's an enjoyable maturity to some aspects of the writing: the three guys who pull the initial prank are genuinely sorry about it, not soulless thugs, for instance. The film's final twist could be guessed by a three-year-old who had never seen a single movie in his life, though.

3. The Lady Eve (A-)

That's more like it. Sturges finally makes it to something a modern audience would recognize as feature length, and also lands some actors that modern audiences would recognize (Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda). Parts of the movie still happen at a breakneck pace - Jean's softening, which under most circumstances would be the plot of the movie on its own, happens by the twenty-minute mark. This is a laudably orginal story, but it's a little jarring all the same. Great performances from everybody, especially Stanwyck, on whose work the movie turns. Though William Demarest's schtick isn't really as funny as I imagine Sturges thought it was.

4. Sullivan's Travels (B+)

This is Preston Sturges' most acclaimed film, and in many people's minds one of the best of all time; Erik Beck, for instance, named it the best film of 1942 in his history of film/the Academy Awards. I don't rate it that highly; I'd put both the film that preceded it and the film that succeeded it ahead of it. It's a pretty good movie, all things considered, but it still has the problems I've had with Sturges' first two films: sudden, major shifts in tone. It goes from farce (though the pratfalls are much, much better-executed in this one and don't feel out of place, for the most part) to social melodrama and back with hardly any transition. This is particularly noticeable at the end, where you get what feels like an outtake from ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang"" then we cut to Hollywood and we get a lengthy wordless physical comedy sequence set to a jaunty score.

There's plenty to like about it, though. Sturges has a lot of fun with his depiction of Hollywood and the people in it. There's a welcome degree of intelligence to things; for instance, he even challenges whether Sullivan's experiment is a good idea and raises the question of whether this is just voyeurism on the part of the wealthy. Joel McCrea (Sturges' primary leading man) is a good lead. Veronica Lake, though I thought a bit flat in a few places, is also quite good, and has a few very affecting moments. Sturges' regular crew of supporting players is present and on the ball per usual (between the Capra box-set and the Sturges box-set, I can now readily identify a bunch of bit-players who hung around the Paramount lot and were in basically everything, like Arthur Hoyt).

5. The Palm Beach Story (A+)

This is easily the funniest movie I've seen from the Golden Age of Hollywood. I've complained in the past of Sturges' issues with tone, but that's decidedly not present here: this is full-on screwball comedy, and incredibly funny at that. McCrea is the male lead again here, opposite Claudette Colbert (personally, I prefer this performance to her work in ""It Happened One Night"", and she was great there too; actually, now that I think about it, there's a similar runaway woman theme). McCrea's competent, but Colbert is exceptional, alongside a panoply of wacky supporting characters (including Hoyt and William Demarest, once again) who for one don't feel out of place in the least. But the MVP is Rudy Vallee (apparently a famous band leader of the period) as an ersatz John D. Rockefeller Jr.; virtually all of his lines are funny on their own, and Vallee's delivery makes them even funnier. I admittedly haven't seen Van Heflin in ""Johnny Eager"", but it'd have to be a really great performance to deserve Best Supporting Actor over Vallee's work here. The Maltese Falcon's Mary Astor is also quite good as his sister. And if the ending of Christmas in July could be seen from a mile away, this film's ending could probably never be predicted, but, in retrospect, fits amazingly well.

6. Hail the Conquering Hero (B-)

After making five movies between 1940-1942, Sturges skipped 1943 entirely and released three films in 1944. These films are the first ones to be made while America was actually involved in World War II (the others are all set/made in the interesting period where World War II was going on in Europe but America was a spectator). This is a satire of the home front of sorts, which is fairly interesting for a production released during the war itself - in this case, a man returns to his hometown after being flunked out of the army for hayfever, and through various contrivances is mistaken for a war hero. The lead, Eddie Bracken, is kind of annoying most of the way through. A lot of the film's satirical elements now seem rather tepid, though I imagine they had a lot more bite in the 1940s. Strangely, it finds its best moments toward the end, where it becomes mostly a drama.

7. The Great Moment (C+)

The sole drama in the collection, and a victim of studio editing interference; this set has the 80-minute cut of the film, but I understand that there are versions of it that run as long as 90 minutes. This is Sturges' third film with Joel McCrea as the lead, and, indeed, he has virtually all his usual actors on hand, despite the shift in genres. There are some nonlinear elements to the storyline, which was comparatively rare in this period. It's the story of a battle over credit for a discovery, not unlike something like ""The Social Network"", though considerably less intense. There's not a lot of real drama here, though the subject matter provides some interest. My main issue with it is that while Sturges' seems to suggest that others' greed and his own nobility caused Dr. Morton to lose out on a patent for his anesthesia treatment, near as I can tell he in fact didn't deserve a patent, because he didn't actually invent anything new, he just found a new use for an existing product.

In summation, ""Preston Sturges - The Filmmaker Collection"" is a seven-disk set with three fairly strong films, two middling films, and two weak films.",1314576000,4,7322,4.699687987519501
2642097,4,B000HT3Q2S,"I love the Preston Sturges black (or perhaps grey) comedy ""Unfaithfully Yours"" and also ""Sullivan's Travels"", both of which I have on DVD in Criterion Collection releases.  Recently, I came across ""Christmas in July"" on television and found this collection in looking for the film on DVD.  The collection has been an excellent purchase, if even for just ""Christmas in July"", a comedy-drama with excellent performances from all and a clever fast-paced story (not a holiday picture, by the way).  ""Sullivan's Travels"" is among Sturges' very best, and deserves its reputation as one of the greatest, and most original, comedies of all time.  I'm not a fan of Henry Fonda, so ""The Lady Eve"" isn't among my favorites, though Barbara Stanwick gives a winning performance.  ""The Great McGinty"" is an unusual drama, without big stars, but an engaging story, nonetheless.  I'm not familiar with the remaining three films, but considering that this collection cost about $25, it doesn't matter to me if they disappoint, since having ""Christmas in July"" alone makes this worthwhile.",1313971200,,1071,5.161849710982659

I had to restart the movie in both cases as it was not possible to watch the film after about 20 seconds of this starting and stopping. I finally got through these scenes, but my guess is there is something defective with the DVD, and I will have recurring problems watching this DVD.

I have watched each of these films several times over the years and I am always amazed at the amount of complexity that Sturgis brings to his work without confusing the viewer. He doesn't ""talk down"" to the viewer either. Sturgis assumes that we are intelligent adults looking for intelligent and pleasurable entertainment.  At bottom or better the bottom line for him is always the heart. You come away from these films really feeling something but not feeling as if you were manipulated by the typical Hollywood bluster.  That is why these movies can be watched over and over again. They always seem so fresh. If you love the movies of that period of time make this set a part of your library.

2642119,5,B000HT3Q2S,"I already own three of the films in this collection and enjoy them regularly.  The collection, however, is an excellent conglomeration of the breadth of Preston Sturges's abilities as a writer and director.  A different kind of social commentator than his contemporary, Frank Capra, Sturges took outlandish situations and pushed them to just one notch shy of absurdity and still treated his audience to valid and hilarious discourses on the Human Condition.

If you have not seen any of Sturges's work, this is an outstanding collection to learn what he was about.  If you are familiar with his work, you will be happily surprised with some of the more obscure works found here.

The oddball in the mix is ""The Great Moment"" which is a quasi-biography and costume piece with Joel McCrea about the development of ether as an anesthetic.  Sturges liked to use what amounted to a repertory company of character actors that filled the major and minor roles in his films, and The Great Moment is no exception.

My favorite in these is still ""The Lady Eve"" which I've owned previously.  The story and acting, and especially the direction, is of a quality that puts this among the best of any movie.  If you want to study this movie, get the Criterion Collection version which includes insightful analyses and interviews describing some of its subtle virtues, but if you want to just enjoy a highly enjoyable film, this one's fine.

""Sullivan's Travels"" features Joel McCrea again and an adorable Veronica Lake in a comedy that takes a turn for the worse for the idealistic hero but then turns out okay in the end, lesson learned.  ""Hail, the Conquering Hero"" and ""Christmas In July"" set up the lead characters with situations they didn't create but for which they have to bear the consequences.  ""The Palm Beach Story"" is a lark, and ""The Great McGinty"" a bit more serious, but both explore the ramifications of a series of questionable decisions made by their lead characters.  In the case of The Great McGinty, which is Sturges's first effort as a writer/director, the quality is not as polished as later efforts, but he clearly can be seen to grow as both a writer and director with subsequent films in the collection.

Two outstanding Sturges films that are NOT included in this collection are ""Unfaithfully Yours"" with Rex Harrison and ""Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" with Eddie Bracken (made the same year as Conquering Hero and with a direct reference to characters in ""The Great McGinty"").  If you like what you see in this collection, please consider adding these last two to your library as well.",1203984000,2,2596,4.841628959276018

2642123,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Preston Sturges may not be a big name nowadays compared to his directing contemporaries such as Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford or Frank Capra, but he was an important director in his time and even nowadays, for those who know him, he was a great director.  Preston Sturges - The Filmmaker Collection - collects seven of his biggest movies.

First in the set is The Great McGinty, which stars Brian Donleavy as a man who goes from being a bum to a governor, only to have it all crash down on him.  This is a decent enough comedy about the world of politics.  It's advertising that's parodied in Christmas in July, with Dick Powell as a man who thinks he's won a contest to come up with an advertising slogan.  It's all the result of a practical joke that gets way out of control before its exposed.

Things really pick up with the next three movies.  The Lady Eve has Henry Fonda as a wealthy yet clumsy young man targeted by con artist Barbara Stanwyck.  Unfortunately for her, she actually falls for him, but when he finds out her true profession, she must engage in an even bigger con to win him back.

Sullivan's Travels, considered by many to be Sturges's best picture, as Joel McCrea (in the first of three roles in Sturges movies) as the title character, a big-time movie director who makes great comedies but wants to make a message picture.  He decides to live the life of a hobo to see how the poor live; at first, this is rather comic but at a certain point things turn much more serious, teaching Sullivan a lesson he wasn't expecting.

Things lighten up in The Palm Beach Story, with the antics even occurring in the opening credits, As McCrea and Claudette Colbert get married.  Five years later, things are on the rocks as they are broke.  Colbert decides to leave McCrea, figuring that if they divorce, he'll finally be able to be a success.  She runs off to Florida, with her husband in pursuit, where they both wind up entangled with an eccentric billionaire and his man-hungry sister.

Next in the set - and the weakest in the septet - is The Great Moment, a drama loosely based on the true story of a dentist (played by McCrea) who discovered the use of ether as an anesthetic.  With little in the way of comedy and recutting done by the studio after Sturges had finished it, this muddled film has its moments, but no great ones.

The last movie, Hail the Conquering Hero, gets things back on stride with Sturges sly tribute to the Marines.  Eddie Bracken plays a shipyard worker who was medically discharged from the Marines for chronic hay fever.  He befriends some Marines, who set up a ruse to make him seem like a hero to his unaware mother.  Unfortunately, the ploy gets out of control as his hometown honors him and puts him up for mayor.

This movie set comes in a nice package but offers nothing in the way of extras outside of movie trailers.  With four great movies (Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Lady Eve and Hail the Conquering Hero), two good ones (The Great McGinty and Christmas in July) and one so-so one (The Great Moment), I am giving this set five stars.  For a chance to see some classic comedies, this is worth picking up.",1188086400,17,3176,4.485217391304348
2642124,4,B000HT3Q2S,"In the 1940's at Paramount, no one topped writer/director Preston Sturges for turning out masterpiece after masterpiece at machine gun pace.  Betweem 1940 and 1944, Sturges created THE GREAT McGINTY, CHRISTMAS IN JULY, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE LADY EVE, THE PALM BEACH STORY, MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, and HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.

The DVD boxed set, PRESTON STURGES: THE FILMMAKER COLLECTION from Universal Home Video, is an enthralling and hugely engrossing Sturges feast that presents gorgeous studio prints of every film above except MORGAN'S CREEK, which is available on a solo Paramount Home Video DVD.

Not even Capra or Wilder topped Sturges for blending comedy and drama to perfection--and often being nominated for a writing Oscar.  (He won in 1940.)  THE GREAT McGINTY is a political satire and shaggy dog story about a nobody (Brian Donlevy) who votes several times in an election and is made Mayor of a town by boss Akim Tamiroff.  Then McGinty becomes Governor of the state--with the proviso that he does favors for ""The Boss"".

CHRISTMAS IN JULY has a coffee slogan contest between rival coffee companies in New York City.  Ordinary clerk Dick Powell believes, falsely, that he has won grand prize.  He and girl friend Ellen Drew go on a super spending spree.  What happens when they realize that they have not really won?  The ending is an ironic wow.  This little 67 minute gem is where the Sturges stock company of supporting actors is really noticeable:  William Demarest (especially), Raymond Walburn, Robert Warwick, Al Bridge, Jimmy Conlin, Porter Hall, and Franklin Pangborn.  All of them seem to appear in each Sturges film.  And the character names are clever and funny.

THE LADY EVE has professional card sharks and gamblers Barbara Stanwyck and Charles Coburn trying to cheat schnook snake lover Henry Fonda on a ship voyage.  But they have a change of heart when Barbara falls for the guy.

SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is a towering masterpiece with Joel McCrea's greatest performance.  He plays film director John L. Sullivan who wants to make a serious social protest film.  ""But with a little sex in it,"" his producers add hopefully.  Masquerading as a hobo, Sullivan meets up with Veronica Lake, who bravely deglamorizes herself because she has a great role.  As the film gets darker and darker, a false murder and mistaken identity leads to a chain gang climax and a happy ending.

I don't like THE PALM BEACH STORY as much as I do other films in this Universal collection.  But the train from New York to Florida with William Demarest and the Quail and Ale Club is screamingly funny.  I don't find the reel one Weinie King funny at all, and the Florida scenes with Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor as millionaires after fun and romance only get to second base for me.  It is a good movie with great scattered moments.

THE GREAT MOMENT is an interesting failure that was finished in 1942, but taken out of Sturges' hands, recut by Paramount bosses, and finally released in 1944.  It stars Joel McCrea (again) in the dramatic biography of the father of anaesthesia in the 1840's.  It is intelligent and well written, but the recutting leaves it all very confusing.

Leaving aside the incomparable MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK (which you can, again, buy or rent from Paramount Home Video for about $10 in a studio print edition), Sturges' last film at Paramount was  HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.  In the performance of his career, Eddie Bracken plays Woodrow Truesmith, born at the very moment that his father was dying in Belleau Wood in World War One.  Cursed with hay fever that makes him 4-F in World War Two (the film was made in 1944), Woodrow is befriended by William Demarest and his Marine buddies in a bar.  One of the Marines, with a hilarious mother fixation, calls up Woodrow's mother and says Woodrow is coming home.  So his whole town gathers to give Woodrow a hero's welcome when he steps off the train.  They even run him for Mayor as the film turns into a Capra satire on small town America.  What will they all do to Woodrow when they learn he never got overseas because of the nasty hay fever?  HAIL is an incomparable achievement.

This is a beautifully designed DVD set with gorgeous studio prints by the copyright owner, Universal.  The box is sturdy and attractive, with color poster art on the back cover.  If only it had some bonuses that Warner Home Video would have put on without thinking twice---film critics chatting about the films one by one, audio commentaries, and that PBS ""American Masters"" feature-length documentary on Preston Sturges.  I would like to know more about the man who made so many truly great, truly funny satires films back to back, then went to Fox in 1948, then apparently died of a heart attack and burn-out in the 1950's.  Someone should sell the PBS biography as a solo DVD to go with this otherwise mostly magnificent collection of luscious and wonderful  comedy satires from a master filmmaker.

I think more attention should be paid to Preston Sturges as a director by classic film collectors-he was truly before his time!",1173571200,3,453,4.6375
2642137,5,B000HT3Q2S,"While others have noted that some of these films are already available in expensive but very worthwhile Criterion editions, it is terrific that they are now available together in a good value set for all to enjoy. The fact that there are no extras except trailers is fine at the price. It's the films themselves which I want to revisit not the extras. Commentaries etc really do only have a limited audience and there are many essays and books available about these films which you could borrow from your local library; ""Romantic Comedy in Hollywood"" by James Harvey would be a great place to start.

If you are seeing them for the first time, I recommend you watch them in release date order, with one exception, so you can observe how Sturges progressed. By way of a summary, the set includes:

- Sturges first directorial effort, the excellent political satire, ""The Great McGinty"", released in 1940.  Brian Donlevy was cast in one of his few leads and he is perfect as the roughneck who becomes Governor. The framing device for the film is amusing and Akim Tamiroff is another character actor who gets a great opportunity as the crooked politician. The film won an Oscar for best screenplay.  This is not a B film by any means but Sturges cleverly made it on a tight budget, partly by avoiding expensive stars in the main roles.
- ""Christmas in July"" is a charming film about a regular guy who thinks he has won a slogan competition due to a poor practical joke played on him by some work colleagues.  Dick Powell is outstanding in the lead and there is the usual mixture of slapstick, cynicism about capitalism and greed and even some touching sentiment.
- By 1941, Sturges hit solid gold with 2 great films with big stars and generous budgets. ""The Lady Eve"" is the timeless tale of the seduction of a wealthy nerd by a card sharp. Sturges liked Barbara Stanwyck and wrote the script for her. In the course of the film, she does a breathtaking parody of the English gentry as the Lade Eve Sidwich. It is hard to imagine who could better capture the humour and the cynicism than Stanwyck and Henry Fonda is the perfect foil with some hilarious pratfalls.  This film may be the perfect comedy.
- ""Sullivan's Travels"" is an extraordinary film which starts as a comedy and ends as a very moving drama.  There is lots said about capitalism and poverty, themes already referrred to in the previous films. Joel McCrea plays a successful Hollywood director, maybe Sturges himself, who sets off as a hobo to learn about poverty in order to plan a script called ""Brother Where Art Thou"". Along the way, he meets out of work actress Veronica Lake and she joins him on his adventures. The film takes an unexpected turn towards the end and demonstrates that harsh realism was not beyond Sturges's abilities. McCrea is perfectly cast as Sullivan and Veronica Lake really comes across as a person instead of the zombie she projected in so many of her films.
- In 1942, ""The Palm Beach Story"" is an hilarious out an out marital romp with the magnetic Claudette Colbert and the charming Joel McCrea. The film is filled with great one liners, an hilarious framing device and a great supporting cast especially Mary Astor and Rudy Vallee. It is probably the closest Sturges came to screwball comedy.
- in 1944, ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" is one of 2 excellent films Sturges made with Eddie Bracken. Bracken perfected the regular guy who becomes swept up in situations beyond his control. The film takes a poke at small town gullibility as Bracken returns home to a hero's welcome in spite of being tossed out of the marines due to chronic hay fever. All the Sturges regulars are on hand but gruff William Demarest has a larger part than usual.
- the last film in the set is the ""The Great Moment"". The film was made in 1942 but sat on the shelf due to misgivings about its box office appeal. It tells the story of H T Morton, the discoverer of the use of ether as an anaesthetic for surgery. The film was re-edited after completion and is made up of 2 flashbacks. The main cuts were made in the first flashback and it is extremely hard to follow exactly what is happening.  The second flashback is much more coherent and the result is a cogent and entertaining story.  The film does not have a good reputation but that is more due to what was done to it than the end result. What remains is still a most interesting story with Joel McCrea perfectly capturing the preoccupation and irritation of a clever mind.  It is worth seeing.

All the prints are excellent.",1169251200,7,4548,4.58179581795818
2642138,4,B000HT3Q2S,"Sturges' films are screwball comedy classics with a top-notch ensemble cast and surprising moments of drama, pathos, and profundity mixed in.

2642139,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Often is talked about the ""good old days,"" and why can't they make them like they used to. This collection of Preston Sturges's films are a perfect example of this talk.  The hope to bring one up to a higher level, the un-acceptableness of divorce, rich wanting to experience poverty, a mistake that starts as a disaster but brings life to the very unhappy, how we see ourselves, how we see others, and the true essence of love the way poets write about are contained in these films.  My favorite by far is ""The Lady Eve.""  A comedy that still sizzles with powerful, pure emotion.  Mixed with this emotion are classic turns and twists.  Stanwyck and Fonda are perfect for their roles.  The co-stars fill their plate with believability, punch, and story support worthy of any film that rises above great to one of the greatests romantic comedys ever made.

The Lady Eve and Sullivan's Travels were already on DVD, part of the Criterion Collection. The quality of those two movies are better on the Criterion DVDs (digital transfers) than in this set. Also the Criterion DVDs have really good special features such as audio commentary, a documentary, and production stills.

The hilarious: all the movies I've seen in this set (I haven't seen MOMENT yet) are hilarious, entertaining, and classic films. Preston Sturges should be more well known. Hopefully this DVD set will help.

Overall: If you are not crazy about special features and spending $72 total on the ridiculously high priced Criterion DVDs of The Lady Eve and Sullivan's Travels, then this is an excellent DVD set to see. I just wish they had release the films separately.",1167177600,6,1423,4.725806451612903
2642144,5,B000HT3Q2S,"Believe the other comments in this section about the value and quality of these discs.  Preston Sturges' comedic writing and stock company of supporting players make all of these films worth owning and watching over and over.  Many of the stories have relevance to today's world, though most were done in the 30's and 40s.

But is anyone else finding problems with the discs skipping in sections, such as at the end of ""The Lady Eve?""  There seem to be no scratches or flaws on the discs themselves.  But five minutes before the end of the movie, it just freezes and jumps inexplicably to the last scene.  The discs overall seem a little shoddy and not as thick as other DVDs.  So, I'm not sure if Universal cut some corners to produce them.",1166832000,2,741,4.526315789473684
2642145,4,B000HT3Q2S,"Any box set that includes ""The Lady Eve"", ""Hail the Conquering Hero"", ""The Great McGinty"" and ""Christmas in July"" is going to get four stars from me. Especially at this price. But considering the importance of these films, I can't believe that ALL I get are the movies. No documentaries, no interviews, no commentary. What gives? Preston Sturges created more great comedies than anybody in the history of cinema. He wrote sharper, snappier dialogue than Woody Allen, Nora Ephron or anybody else whose films sit on my bookshelves. Just take a look at McGinty. I can't imagine a better primer on how politics really works. And who else can make you laugh at this kind of material? Sturges was a true genius and his films have remained amazingly fresh. But you'd never know it from this set.  There's not even a booklet. Shame on Universal for putting out this no-frills package. And where the hell is ""Miracle at Morgan's Creek""? Anybody who thinks ""The Great Moment"" is a better film, or more representative of Sturgess' career than Miracle, is out of their mind. That said, this is still the best-priced box set of a great director I've come across. And only one stinker in the bunch.",1166054400,2,1184,4.747572815533981
8141294,1,B000HT3Q2S,There are seven movies in this collection and three of the discs were completely defective and unplayable.  I informed the seller about the problem. But I was beyond the return period and they essentially told me to pound sand.  I bought these items as used but supposedly of very good quality and 100% guaranteed to play. This was simply untrue. I will never purchase anything from this vendor again.,1493769600,,401,4.797101449275362
