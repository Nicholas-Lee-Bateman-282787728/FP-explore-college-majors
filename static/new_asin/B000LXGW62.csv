8164795,1,B000LXGW62,"This production of this DVD shows indifference, even disrespect to a work of art. Forget about how a landmark film needs care in transfer, sometimes even using multiple prints to get the best transfer, it seems to be done by an unattended machine and then someone inserting a menu page.
Many scenes are cut off just randomly. The audio transfer is terrible - huge parts towards the end are practically inaudible - I checked it on both the Stereo and the Dolby 5.1 versions. There is an annoying boosting of bass throughout. The video format is the worst one can do - it is 16:9 inside a 4:3 window, as if we were still in the day and age of VCR's. To see that properly, you need to change your DVD output to 4:3 'Pan & Scan' and zoom in from your TV. Ridiculous waste of resolution!
One positive is that unlike many other Indian DVD's, this one does not torture you with forced previews which you cannot skip. Otherwise steer clear of ""Ulra DVD"" and find a copy from some other manufacturer.",1420243200,2,991,4.420765027322404
8164796,5,B000LXGW62,"Paper Flowers ( Kaagaz Ke Phool) is one of the best of Guru Dutt. It shows the inner working of the movie industry much like ""A star is Born: from this side. However in true classic Indian fashion the story is richer and more complex than the current Indian movies. Guru Dutt was the pioneer, like Orson Wells, in camera technique. This is one of the great movies.",1394841600,,364,4.367647058823529
8164797,4,B000LXGW62,"ANOTHER OF GURU DUTT'S PRODUCTION PLAYED BY VERY MANY OF VETERANS SUCH AS WAHEEDA REHMAN, BABY NAAZ, JOHNY WALKER, TUN TUN AND MOHAN CHOTI. FAMILY DRAMA WITH SOME HIT SONGS. REASONABLY PRICED",1393891200,,191,5.0
