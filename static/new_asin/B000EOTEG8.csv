2526084,5,B000EOTEG8,"In my opinion, Mr. Wood brings history into a wonderful light with his vast knowledge and extraordinary presentation skills. With impeccable videography to match his seemingly unquenchable hunger for history's details, perhaps the only other presenter of equal note would be another Brit: David Attenborough. His productions on the nature of Mother Earth, along with Michael Wood's historic masterpieces, could easily be the most memorable and informative DVD's in your collection. If early childhood educators were to include Mr. Wood's marvelous storytelling in the classroom, the world would be a far better place.  Both Wood and Attenborough are as gifted as any when it comes to exciting adults and their children about the world in which we live.  If you value education to any degree, purchase all of Mr. Wood's DVD's and watch them repeatedly.  There are endlessly delicious details about the lives of the people who made history. You will come to understand how those details are important in understanding the larger picture we have all come to know as history itself.",1354924800,12,1078,5.219653179190751
2526085,5,B000EOTEG8,Interesting and informative. He does exellent reference work and keeps the viewer interested. The figures come to life and the understanding of myths is made clear,1354060800,5,163,5.3076923076923075
2526086,5,B000EOTEG8,"Instead of a single subject series, this time Michael Wood has four independent searches. These episodes are placed out of order as the advertisement at the end of one episode points to an earlier episode.

The Search for Shangri-la brings back the old images of Frank Capra's movie ""Lost Horizon"" (1937).  We learn of the writers and the location which was almost impossible to get to because of the politics of the time of this series. Michael looks bedraggled in this episode. But as much as you think you know the story there is always more to learn.

The Queen of Sheba stories have a black and white difference from the old mostly bare-breasted Betty Blythe movie (1921). She really got a round from the Hebrew Scriptures to the Koran among other writings. Again just when you think you know all there is to know Michael Woods pulls something out of his hat that you would never have thought of as trade routes reveling more about the real Sheba.

Arthur: The Once and Future King is probably Michael Wood's best of the presentations in this series. We see excerpt from the film ""Excalibur"" (1981). And the best part of the tail are told by an enthusiastic cutie of who appears unaccredited tell the tail while lighting candles. Look at her necklace. I learned more about the ties among people in Europe and the islands. Again must of history that is lost in statistics is brought alive by Michael Wood.

Jason and The Golden Fleece will have you reeling as you follow the different trails set by different writers at different times. We find that Jason does not fit the Michael Woods's definition of a standard hero. And somewhere on the way we are more interested in Media and her troubles as people accuse her of being a witchy woman. It is not a nice tail but makes you want to know more.",1287705600,8,1798,4.571428571428571
2526087,5,B000EOTEG8,"I could listen to this man tell stories over and over.  He is more than just a good historian, he put color and passion into his narration.  I watch the DVD often.  It's worth the price and the visual is a feast for the eyes.",1213401600,9,225,3.9555555555555557
2526088,5,B000EOTEG8,"Jason and the Golden Fleece, The Queen of Sheba, Shangri-la, Arthur. Michael Wood's documentaries, as always provide a level of involvement in the myths and legends he brings to life as no other documentarians have done. His 250 mile trudge across the back side of the Himalayans in the company of Nepalese villagers is a case in point, and his arrival at the thousand year old fortress/retreat which stands as the best thesis for Shambala is monumental.

The photography is spectacular, the settings are both spectacular and gritty, and they are filmed in a manner that engages the viewer with the history, the indigent populace, and the meatiness of the legends.",1200614400,38,664,4.981981981981982
2526089,4,B000EOTEG8,"Not up to standards of ""In the Footsteps of Alexander"" but only because the myths he explores in these shows have less of an historical basis.  This is still a fun learning experience and a good introduction to two more myths (including how Jason's story really ended) that have influenced Western culture.

2526090,4,B000EOTEG8,"With 'In search of the Trojan War'(another BBC DVD) Michael Wood made a thorough study of the age of heroes and legends. He tried to find historical facts only to end up with hypotheses.

The same goes for 'In Search of Myths and Heroes' but this time Wood seems to have lost his panache that took a hold on us in The Trojan war DVD.Of course his journey through the Himalayas, through frozen and barren landscapes are able to take a hold on us, but we keep asking:'Is this all there is?'.

His quest for hidden realms since long gone, treasures and objects give the impression that he lost the intellectual spirit to investigate as thoroughly as in the Trojan War. Is the queen of Sheba a historical person? Maybe. Does Shangri-La exist? Could be. Does the Grail exist? He does not answer but takes us to a place in England where they keep a tiny wooden cup and say to every visitor that this is The Holy Grail. No further comment. Yes this is all there is.(From the intellectual point of view.)

But the real value of 'In Search of Myths and Heroes' lies
in the fact that it is a very well directed documentary of several countries in the far East. In particular the hardship that Michael Wood and his companions have to suffer during their travel through icy cold mountain paths, make this DVD interesting enough for four stars.",1155254400,40,1331,4.491735537190083

2526102,5,B000EOTEG8,Michael Wood is such a great lecturer and so enthusiastic about his material. I really wish I would have had Wood as a college prof. He's one of the few great ones who extends his passionate research to the viewer. I especially liked his show on Shakespeare that cuts thru all the rumors.,1407715200,,288,4.452830188679245

2526105,5,B000EOTEG8,"Michael Wood does not present a scholarly perspective so much, as if one is looking for information one might receive in a scholarly journal, book or lecture. Nevertheless, he is engrossing. His human touch adds a lot, and I learned something new from watching this. Since this is a field I have studied in length, that is saying quite a bit. (I say this tongue in cheek for one can never know everything.
Sadly.)",1391472000,,413,4.594594594594595

I've learned that Michael Woods info is always accurate and even more interesting than movies based on the info in books...he delves into the remains of history and pairs it with the historical references.  This may be the last of a period, where we're able to make videos and capture these things for posterity; &  what he's doing is extremely important work.",1376006400,,420,4.441558441558442
2526108,5,B000EOTEG8,"I find these documentaries fascinating.  Actually, I wish they were longer a I am sure there is more, but I understand the time requirements involved. Some of these journeys seem to have been arduous. These are extremely informative.",1363910400,,233,5.131578947368421

8112414,5,B000EOTEG8,"I bought this to show to a class I am teaching on James Hilton's Lost Horizon. It gave my students not only historical insight into the novel's possible origins, but on life and conditions in Nepal and Tibet that are almost unchanged since 1933. But it also covered some of the destruction wrought by Mao's Cultural Revolution (which I am sure was tough for my Chinese student). Wood is an excellent narrator, fascinating traveling companion, and a balanced cultural observer and commentator.",1523491200,,492,5.012195121951219

8112420,5,B000EOTEG8,"I originally saw three of the four PBS episodes years ago and missed the one of Arthur just as I finished a rather detailed book on Arthur and his possible historical reality. Now that I have watched the episode with Wood I was amused that he may have found the answer where no one else was looking, as did the author of the book.

The episode on Shangri-la was also amazing and I just could not move away from the TV screen. The historical reality of 1949 and the end of the town that was still alive at that time is just too tragic. It is fun to see that the Jason and the Golden Fleece story is still alive and continues to this day and the story of the Queen of Sheba takes on a different perspective through Michael Wood's lens.

The narrantives flow like a detective story trying to solve a mystery and uncovers many clues that take you off the trail until you finally reach the answer in the quest.

Great to see that it was still available for viewing on DVD.",1473033600,3,967,4.216216216216216
8112421,3,B000EOTEG8,I thought it was good but not as good as the video on India. Worth watching but see if you can rent it before buying,1458864000,,116,3.68

8112423,5,B000EOTEG8,"Beginning with an African proverb about the reason for the creation of man that sets the tone for the shows to come, Michael Wood sets out on an exploration of four of the greatest myths and stories of human history.  These are tales that have resonated through the ages and still fascinate us today.  Each segment looks at a different tale.  The series chapters are ""The Queen of Sheba,"" ""Shangri-La,"" ""Jason and the Golden Fleece"" and ""Arthur: The Once and Future King.""

In the ""Queen of Sheba"" segment, Wood goes to Ethiopia, the Yemen and Israel, and he looks at Jewish, Christian and Muslim stories of the queen, and at local legends.  He visits multiple locales where the people lay claim to the queen as their own, and some of these locales are not exactly safe.  One has to give Wood credit for journeying to the Yemen, not the most hospitable land on Earth, and seeking out those who recount their legends of this famed woman.

In ""Jason and the Golden Fleece,"" he explores the route that Jason and the Argonauts took to claim their prize and how the real life voyages of the past can become those of legend.  In a conversation with Marianna Koromila, authoress of ""The Greeks and the Black Sea,"" she tells him that there were hundreds of quests into the Black Sea for wealth and that they condensed into one, that of Jason, an explanation that most likely has much truth to it.

In Georgia, the country known for being the home of the Golden Fleece, Wood explores local villages and traditions, and experiences the nearly tribal culture that still exists there today.  He even encounters briefly the descendants of the very colonists who have lived on the Black Seas since the times when Greeks first ventured there.  When he enters the heartland of the Georgian nation, he is given advice that is quite telling, ""Don't look ... .""  Georgia shows how Wood attempts to see what traditions and rituals could have contributed to the legend, and it, also, displays a mark of all the episodes, the stunning scenery and dramatic vistas that stand out in the landscapes which he visits.

The storytellers who declaim the various myths must be given credit, too, for their dramatic and captivating tales of each of the legends.  Michael Wood does not just spin his own tales of these mythical and heroic events: He enlists the skills of four gifted storytellers to retell these legendary accounts.  They comprise Adjoa Andoh, Syreeta Kumar, Sasha Behar and Aoife McMahon.  These four talented actresses bring the myths to life.

""Myths and Heroes"" is free from some of the political correctness that has marred some of Wood's other works.  This feels more like a traditional Western narrative that tries to look at all sides of the narratives.  At times, particularly near the end of the Arthurian episode, Wood does indulge in his habit of building a whole bird from a single feather without any good DNA, constructing an Ostrich when the bird is in reality a Seagull.  Having said that, most of the time he recognizes that much is myth, and one cannot determine the true reality of what went before.  Fact and fiction, myth and history, all intertwine.

The musical score enhances the striking scenery and images that make such an impact on the viewer in this series.  Composed and conducted by Howard Davidson, the score is performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  In this series, the music, the landscapes, the historical facts as we know them, the legends and tales, the clips from classic films and Wood's interpretations of them all come together to make a splendid whole.  Truly here, there are the truths of both history and imagination.
