8274866,5,B0019N76R2,"This is a great show, with great family values, that shows, not everything being perfect, but how to handle situations that are less than ideal, with love and maturity and forebearance. It is nitty, and gritty, and real, and leaves you with a warm glow long after you've seen an episode. Shame it only ran one season. I can't find it to download or buy for love nor money. It IS available on youtube, however, which is the next best thing.",1334448000,10,439,4.432098765432099
8274867,5,B0019N76R2,"This TV Series began the same year as 7th Heaven. This one lasted for one season. 7th Heaven lasted for 10 seasons. Both series involve an extended family, father and mother who adopt unwanted children and had various adventures (and misadventures) through the series. In the case of Second Noah the premise included the care of an old zoo with similarly unwanted animals...an interesting ironic touch.

Which series was best? No contest...Second Noah stood head and shoulders above 7th Heaven. Why it was cancelled after one season and 7th Heaven went on for 10 seasons is one of the great mysteries of our time. My own opinion is that the standard audience, who buys the products that sell TV series, wanted something fairly simple, somewhat sweet and they wanted to feel good. Second Noah did not always do that...although it always made you think...often long after an episode.

Second Noah was real, gritty and many times I had to hold back tears or anger at some particular injustice. The acting was phenomenal, especially from the brilliant children and teenagers...one of whom was a young James Marsden. I do watch a lot of TV and I have a variety of interests. In my 50+ years of TV watching, there are two particular TV series that merit a ""5 stars plus"" in my book and ironically both series lasted only one season and each of these two favorites have yet to hit the DVD market. Those two incredible examples of what the best of TV can produce would be Second Noah and Jack and Bobby. I just keep waiting and hoping for the chance to own these and watch them again.",1334016000,12,1576,4.645161290322581
