8440584,1,B002JECT68,"'Mr. Stiches' makes 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' look like 'Gone with the Wind'.

Cullen doesn't just lack talent but has given me a sense of shame for being a member of the human race.

If you are made to watch this movie, keep something sharp near by to press into your skin so that you may experience anything else.",1400630400,,315,4.233333333333333
8440585,5,B002JECT68,From what I understand Charles Cullen makes and puppeteers his own puppets. That fact makes me enjoy this movie that much more. I like this film and gave it 5 stars because I think that the movie was funny and kept me interested the whole time. This is one of my favorites by Charles E Cullen and I would suggest you make it part of your movie collection.,1253664000,,355,4.235294117647059
