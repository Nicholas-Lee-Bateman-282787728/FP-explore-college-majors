7564627,5,B01962M2WQ,"I've seen so many film versions of Heidi over the years and almost always come away disappointed by how they stray from Spyri's novel.  I was so happy to find this film, which captures much of the original essence of the novel.  After reading the book with my children,  I looked at several versions before settling on this one to watch as a family.  The grandfather was a bit gruffer than in the novel, but not nearly so grumpy as those in other movie versions.

I have two minor complaints, one about the film itself, and one about the streaming video purchased here on Amazon.  First, in the book, Heidi goes through a process of spiritual growth which is disappointingly (though not surprisingly) left out of the film.  Second, this film was made with German-speaking actors, and the streaming version shows the dubbed English.  While I appreciate the work that went into creating an English audio version, I wish I had the option to watch it in the original German, either with or without sub-titles.  (It appears all those options are available on the DVD, so perhaps I just need to purchase this video a second time in that format.)",1494115200,9,1139,4.655

8744132,5,B01962M2WQ,"When going to watch the movie for homeschool because our L/A is covering the story, I chose this version based on the reviews that the character's portrayal was closest to the book.
I've seen other versions and this one is, now, probably my favorite. It is really lovely, well done version.

The version had a very Anne of Green Gables (the version with Megan Follows) feel to it.",1516060800,,380,4.588235294117647

8744135,5,B01962M2WQ,"Hands down, the best film version of Heidi. It has all the tenderness and sensitivity of the classic Shirley Temple version, with the added bonus of breathtaking views of the Swiss Alps. The version I watched on Amazon video is in the original Suisse-Deutsche of the Landquart region of Switzerland with the Frankfurt scenes in modern German. The subtitles are reasonably accurate. I haven't seen the English-dubbed version but imagine it would lose a lot without the original actors' voices. Anuk Steffen is flawless as Heidi. For an actress so young, she gives a flawlessly natural performance. She never seems like she's acting. Her emotions feel completely genuine: he obvious affection for her ""Grosse-vater"", her friendship and compassion for Klara. I was completely captivated. Highest recommendation.",1509753600,,808,5.420634920634921
8744136,4,B01962M2WQ,A good family movie.  Beautiful scenery.  I would have given it 5 stars except that I made the mistake of watching it with my younger children (6 & 4) and they found many scenes to be sad.  Perhaps a bit of an emotionally confusing movie for younger children.,1508544000,2,259,4.354166666666667
