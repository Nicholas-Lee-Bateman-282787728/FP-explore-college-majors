8693564,1,B00R041DU0,"This is a pure perversion of the classic book and film ""Wuthering Heights"". Shame on James Caan and these shameless so-called belligerent talentless actors cavorting about like fools. Someone should sue this group of twisted producers, starting with the people who authorised the viewing of this rubbish. Don't waste your time!",1444003200,2,327,5.431372549019608

8693566,4,B00R041DU0,"This movie might not be released until May on this site, but I actually found it on Wal-Mart. It has everything I look for in a movie of this type: lots of drama, sexy guys (one of which is shown shirtless a couple of times!), romance, and it's well-acted. I could have done without the dull narration, though and the ending is heartbreaking. Still, this is overall a beautiful film!",1427587200,,383,4.485714285714286
