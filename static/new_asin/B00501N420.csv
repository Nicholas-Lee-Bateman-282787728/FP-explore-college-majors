4511358,5,B00501N420,"I remembered this series from the early 80's.  I know it got good reviews at the time but I guess the Saturday night 10 PM slot made it tough for ratings.  Well produced, written and acted. It was well cast and there seemed to be great chemistry.  I think today in the right time slot if would be a big hit.",1320105600,9,307,4.0

4511374,4,B00501N420,"This is another show with a great cast that had a bad time slot and never caught on.

The Yellow Rose is a working ranch in Texas.  Owned by the Champion family but the Champion family is not your usual family.  Roy is the new patriarch and is the son of the first wife.  Quisto is a son from an affair while dad was in Mexico.  And Chance is the lost and oldest son from a forbidden affair.  (This comes out over the entire series.)  The Champion's arch nemsis is Jeb Hollister.  Jeb hates the Champions because he lost the Yellow Rose to them in a horse race bet.

One of the fun things about watching this show is seeing future stars in small roles like Dennis Haybert as a soldier with just a few lines.  Who knew back then he would become the first black president (24) or one of the most recognizable voice in commercials.

The cast was pretty much all up and coming stars.  All had a lot of experience but except for David Soul, had not really became a household name.  Sam Elliot is the brooding stranger brought to his birthright by chance - Chance McKenzie.  David Soul is the eldest legitimate son, Roy.  This is definitely his best role ever.  Edward Albert was Quisto Champion.  Cybill Sheppard is the widow Colleen Champion.  To add a bit of star power, Chuck Conners is Jeb Hollister, Jane Russell is his sister (and Chance's mother).  Deborah Shelton is Jeb's daughter and love interest to Roy.  (I am not sure if this was before or after she came to people's attenetion as Mandy Winger on Dallas).

The cast was great, the writing was good (but doesn't quite hold up) and the production values are spot on.  Overall a great attempt to bring back the Western Genre to TV.

The one complaint I have is this is an on demand product and so the chapter breaks are at 10 minute intervals and there are no special features.  What I hate about on demand products is they charge a premium but give you nothing to make up for the extra cost.",1467849600,3,1948,4.347222222222222

4511430,4,B00501N420,"This is not bad if you like the subject matter or the cast.  I don't like the fact that it is set in Texas but they did not have the decency to film it there, it was filmed entirely in California and it shows.  In one scene, they are leaving Huntsville prison and there are hills in the background!  And it has its fantasy moments.  On a trail drive---after the cast members drove tractor trailers (yeah ok)--- they had to go through an abandoned mine--in South Central Texas, now---and then they simply cut the fence to take the cattle through an Air Force base!  And they did not get in trouble over that one. OK, and they also play loose with TX. geography.  In the pilot, they are on the Rio Grande and yet that cattle drive has to go to Uvalde.  Despite all the nonsense, I liked it, it was entertaining and I remember when it was first on.  Despite a lot of foolishness thrown at them by the writers, the cast does a superb job.  Everybody in this show is just first rate.  And there are a few surprises like Jane Russell and Isela Vega.  As I say, this is a nice one to watch but after you see a few episodes, it is not surprising that it lasted  only one season.  It just seemed to run out of steam after about the first two or three discs.",1394755200,,1248,4.15

4511435,5,B00501N420,"Chuck Connors and David Soul are great in this-backed up by a wonderful modern western story. Mysterious drifting cowboy Chance(Elliot) becomes a hand at the champion ranch where he constantly butts heads with Roy (Soul) the eldest son of Wade Champion-now passed on-and frequently making pot holes in the pasture with Colleen (Cybil Shepard) Wade's widow. Jeb Hollister (Connors) owns the whole town and will do almost anything to get back the Champion ranch that he lost to Wade in a poker game years back. Edward Albert jr., Ken Curtis (Festus from gunsmoke), Noah Beery, Deborah Shelton and others lend great support. Most episodes end with a cliff-hanger making us desperate to see what happens next! For a night time soap opera, this has a lot of action with many fist fights and gunfights. Women viewers will be turned on by the love triangles, family drama and Elliot always losing his shirt. Elliot does a good job. David Soul proves once again he is a great actor with his intensity and charisma. Chuck Connors is not intimidated by Soul's brilliant performance and gives one himself proving his underrated talent. Cybil is one hot mamma that knows what she wants, and is always zeroing in on Sam's hairy lovin. Not to be outdone by Cybil, Deborah Shelton as Juliette Hollister Steals her scenes as a tough but sweet beautiful little hottie. Cybil and Deborah's sexy female magnetism never lets up. William Smith shows up in an episode and gives a down right scary performance as an ex con out for revenge and has a great fight with Elliot. Fullscreen dvd video and audio has been very well done.",1385164800,2,1606,4.8014440433212995

It will be disappointing for the people who do not have a compatible player.",1378684800,5,509,4.347368421052631

4511442,3,B00501N420,I ordered this disc because I think Sam Elliott is awesome.  I have not seen this since it was on television some years ago but wanted to have it available.  I will get around to it soon and know it will be great.,1375747200,,213,3.9302325581395348
4511443,4,B00501N420,This was such a fun walk down Memory Lane!  Some of my favorite actors in all the styles of the 80's.  Sam Elliot and Cybill Shepherd together again.,1371600000,,149,4.285714285714286
4511444,5,B00501N420,"I have been waiting for this to come out every since they cancelled the series.  This was one of my favorite all time series and was so disappointed when it was cancelled.  The acting is very good and the story line is great.  Sam Elliot, David Soul and Cybil Shepherd were great in their parts.  Would recommend to anyone that likes westerns, drama and romance.",1370044800,2,362,4.523076923076923
4511445,5,B00501N420,"I haven't watched it yet, but I will be.  I can't imagine Sam Elliot being in anything that I didn't like.  I'd never heard of the series B-4.",1369872000,,142,4.035714285714286
4511446,5,B00501N420,"Everybody like this series.  I loan it out everybody hangs on to it.  They think they might want to watch it ""Once More.""

David Soul was a big star when this was made but Sam Elliott stole this series.  Soul was the one character who was not convincing to me.  Sam & Cybal--what is there not to like?",1367884800,2,301,4.120689655172414
4511447,5,B00501N420,Loved this show when on in early 80's. So when I saw I it out on DVD couldn't resist buying it. Love it as much today as in the 80's.,1367366400,,133,3.466666666666667
4511448,5,B00501N420,"I've been waiting for years for this show to come to DVD (or even VHS).  This was a show I loved upon watching it thirty years ago.  With Sam Elliott, David Soul (yes, I was a Starsky & Hutch fan), Cybil Shephard in her glorious prime and Chuck Connors in a juicy bad guy role, this show snapped.  Trying to capture the glory of the prime time soap days, this show focused on a cattle ranch family that was struggling to survive.  The cast makes the show.  The writing was very well done as well as the sets, characters and atmosphere.  Critics raved about it on NBC, but the strong Dallas and Dynasty kept people from tuning in.  A pity.  Even seven years later, the accolades were so good, NBC reran it in prime time in 1990 to see if it could find an audience.  A very strong show if you liked the grand old prime time soap-style story telling.  The cast, and their portrayals, are alone worth the price of admission.",1367107200,2,920,4.296511627906977

4511454,5,B00501N420,Loved the mini series! Wished there was a sequel. Sam Elliot and Sybil Sheppard are great together and it has all the components of the great western type shows of the 80's.,1334707200,,173,4.4375
4511455,5,B00501N420,"I have searched for this series for years, found one last year ordered it, it was a scam.  I finally found this one at amazon.com, love it, it is very high quality.  Love that Sam Elliote no other man is as sexy.",1332028800,,212,4.023809523809524
4511456,5,B00501N420,"I am so very glad to have found this dvd set of the Yellow Rose in Region Free so I could view it.
Absolutely loved it and feel real sad that it was not continued after that one season. I found it very hard to turn it off each night. Great scenery and exciting story. The actors/actresses were great, especially David Soul and Sam Elliot.
David was great to watch in another role after being used to him as Hutch in Starsky and Hutch.
I fully recomend this set for anyone who likes westerns and David Soul.",1331424000,9,506,4.22680412371134

I gave this as a gift for the holiday season and the person I gave it to, just got around to watching the disc's and the disc stops at approx 1:20-1:29 and gives a ""BAD DISC"" message. Very poor product testing leads to very upset customers.",1330560000,3,368,4.426470588235294

4511459,4,B00501N420,"I haven't bought the dvds (yet) but I have fond memories of this program. Unlike Dynasty and Dallas, which were litanies of family betrayal, Yellow Rose had families that stood together. Sure, there were family intrigues and squabbles, but when push came to shove, they stood together. I may be remembering this falsely, but I know I enjoyed the show very much, while I couldn't stand Dynasty or Dallas or their offspring.",1325808000,20,422,4.875
4511460,5,B00501N420,"I got this for christmas and it was terrific.  Sam elliott was wonderful, the story line kept your attention the whole time. Chuck Conner's portrayel of jeb hollister was really convincing.  Sex, lies, murder and much more,  just like the greats like dallas, knots landing, etc.  The only thing bad about this is the network only had it for 22 episodes.  Once again, another example of dumb networks who never give shows a chance.",1325721600,16,430,4.756756756756757

8450642,5,B00501N420,"We've had this about 3 months and watched it four times. I've sent it as a gift. I'm stunned that I was totally unaware of it when it was on NBC. Where on earth did they hide this? Stars galore; in addition to the big guns like Elliott, Connors, Soul and Shepherd, if you watch Dallas you'll recognize people who later played roles on Dallas. But apparently this got swamped by Dallas, or something like it. Good entertainment. Wish it had been on longer so there were more episodes. Again, how did NBC deploy it's genius and manage to hide this one? It must have taken a lot of work to keep it out of sight. The story of how they managed that should be taught in marketing classes.",1503446400,,682,4.294573643410852
8450643,5,B00501N420,The quality of the DVD was very good.  The acting was excellent. The writing of the later episodes was regrettable. I blame it on the network.,1502496000,,142,4.461538461538462
