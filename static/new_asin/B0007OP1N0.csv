It begins with men singing around a campfire. The mail arrives. Tom Lansing gets bad news, he quits to return home. His friend Bandy also leaves. Toms father is in jail, accused of murder. He needs to get Butcher Wells as a witness to prove his innocence. Those who go to that ghost town never leave. A man rides there, chased by John Law. Tom Smith can fight some. Kramer is the boss of this outlaw roost. Tom fights Kramer, no holds barred. Tom wins and gets the girl. They are married by the Parson (he also strayed here and couldn't leave). The men leave to rob a wagon. But a shot prevents this robbery! Who did it? One gang member will investigate. (Identification was done by a hat.)

The Parson recognizes Tom Lansing, and tells he can prove Toms father is innocent. There is a Kangaroo Court (the name tells of its Australian origins) to handle suspected traitors. Who is the double-crosser? Tom pulls a pistol to capture Butcher Wells and bring him back alive. But Wells has spare guns. The horses are stampeded out of town. There is plenty of shooting for action! [Nobody seems to need time to reload their six-shooters. The bent arms suggest blanks, not aimed fire.] The posse arrives to capture the gang. Wells gets away so there is a chase. Tom catches him for another fight. There is a happy ending. Tome gets the girl, Bandy gets the cook.

This seems below average for a story. If no one is allowed to leave where did they get their food (or the money to pay for it)? The fist fights seem false, they need a better trainer for more realistic punches. Its not a bad story, but there are better ones.",1405296000,,1648,4.432343234323432
