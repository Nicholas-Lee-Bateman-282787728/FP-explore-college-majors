5187666,4,B008X6HSLC,"The story has been told by now. It begins like Severance but with a bunch of yobboes in place of the employees. It ends all but the same way. Strangers in Yorkshire village fall prey to villagers' whims and fancies...in the most bizarre, grotesque, gruesome and violent ways.
I thought Severance was black. How much blacker than black can black get? Here it is and revel in the villagers' revelling in their own culture!
Enjoy!
As an afterthought, it may well do for Yorkshire what ""Wrong Turn"" did for West Virginia...",1384473600,,519,4.714285714285714
5187667,5,B008X6HSLC,"This is 5 STAR Horror at it's freak show best.  Sit right down and get ready to be shocked from start to finish and oh what a finish.  This movie is sure to be a cult classic.  It ranks right up there with movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, TORSO  and House of a 1000 Corpses just to name a few of my favorites. Like fish food for your fishes- this is food for horror fans.",1383955200,,379,3.9473684210526314
5187668,4,B008X6HSLC,"Sort of a 21st century British version of 2000 Maniacs. I laughed numerous times and thought the movie was quite funny, however the person I saw it with just said that it was ""different"". If you liked 2000 Maniacs then this should be on your watchlist. Be aware that the dialogue can be somewhat hard to understand at times, and some of the jokes are probably funnier if you are from the UK.",1382832000,,391,4.36986301369863
5187669,4,B008X6HSLC,"Wheewww! have to get some fresh air? After watching this british exploitation film, i must say that it is a totally off the wall, freaky, gore filled, totally insane film. every minute it gets even more weird, and you are bombarded with total insanity. It has a really bizarre storyline and is a cross between FILMS such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Two Thousand Maniacs, Friday the 13TH, and other horror classics. I even noticed a little Monty Python thrown in with the naked piano player. alot of gore and blood was in this movie, and it even made me a little squeamish. Found this little film really warped and surreal and think that this may become a cult classic. The 5 teens did a fantastic job with their acting, just wish the main guy and cute girlfriend could have made it out alive. I'm sure that this film could be watched... don't know if it would be approved by all... but it is a full fledged assault on your senses. Wonder if this film company will be making more likewise films, would be anxiously awaiting to see more of their future works.",1381881600,2,1057,4.510416666666667
5187670,3,B008X6HSLC,"Katie (Jo Hartley) and Jeff (James Doherty) are two social workers who take four troubled teens to a remote cottage in a remote village for...I am not sure what, but they are there. The townsfolk all seem to have the same bad teeth and large ears. After a run in, our heroes become the main attraction in a theater one might see in ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" complete with a bare bottomed organ player right out of Monty Python.

The theater aspect, which was by far the highlight of the film, needed a third act. There was significant internal conflict within the teen group which served more as a distraction. Instead they should have used this as an opportunity to develop dark humor. The film is also sold as a comedy, but the humor was more in their outfits. The production certainly has the potential to achieve cult status as it has all the qualifications, but for me it fell short. Personally I prefer ""House of a 1,000 Corpses"" or ""10,000 Maniacs"" or ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" for this type of cult genre.

Recommend as a strong cult rental. My local Walmart $9.96

The movie is certainly something special,i enjoy how it was really eerie and just had a creepiness to it then it turned into something even crazier. Dark humor in this,it totally makes me laugh in a sick way. I love when the son is laid to rest and they place his little carrot girlfriend ontop of him.

5187674,5,B008X6HSLC,"This little scorcher of a film is set in Yorkshire. It is about four young offenders who are being taken on a weekend with two care workers to learn a bit about how others live. Jeff (James Doherty `In The Loop'), is the square one who wants rules and boundaries to keep the kids in check and Kate (Jo Hartley - `The Young Victoria') is the one who gets down with the homies type.

Well they arrive at their destination which is a dilapidated ex farm type place and get down to lots of swearing, complaining and `attitude' especially Dwight, who is a real pain. As a reward for cleaning up the dump, they get taken to the local pub, `The Dirty Hole'. This is full of locals who are quite clearly dentist dodgers and the Landlord Jim doesn't do food but does do home made pork scratching - the hairy sort. Next day they sally forth to do some reclamation work at a train graveyard and soon the locals are on the scene and things get out of hand pretty quick.

This is just excellent, I actually expected nothing, but this is like an extreme version of `The League of Gentleman', it says in the opening credits who designed `Blood and Gore Effects', so you pretty much know what was coming. But and there is a great big but here, they are incidental to the whole thing rather than being the raison d'tre . The humour is dark in a depraved way, the grotesquery of characters are all just brilliant and it is genuinely scary in a kind of freak you out way, rather than relying on sudden `frights'. We even have a house band at the pub and a full on banjo player, with a rather well penned ditty that gives some indication as to the welcome `outsiders' will receive. Add to this the fact that the characters all get a chance to shine and you have close to a perfect horror flick. There are some strong regional accents that I know some people find hard to understand, but trust me as a Brit, these are spot on.

This is not for the squeamish; there is blood, gore, torture and some jaw droppingly ugly freaks here. Co writer and director Alex Chandon has made an original, highly entertaining and darkly comic tale and its based in Yorkshire - what is not to like? A special mention goes to Seamus O Neil (War Horse) who plays Jim and steals every scene he is in; he alone gets the full five stars, this was the most entertaining film I have seen in ages and can not recommend highly enough, don't eat your tea whilst watching and if you like pork scratchings, this will put you off them for life.",1352160000,17,2492,4.309168443496802

5187679,5,B008X6HSLC,"There's a line in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert that goes something like: ""I don't know if the ugly fence of suburbia is there to keep us out or to keep them in.""
For anyone who thinks torture porn is associated with some sort of imbecility, that it is mutually exclusive with a finely orchestrated plot and a thought provoking use of thematics, this movie will make you think again, if you are able to think at all.
Here come the spoilers.
The very first scene is put there quite deliberately as a litmus test, even as a sort of courtesy. Anybody who hasn't already got the picture that this is not a film for the weak stomached will know soon enough: a posh couple enjoying some lemonade are axed in cold blood by a thirsty workingman. Not only does this indicate that the movie is going to bloody as all get up, it tells us that it's going to dig right in with a pointed metal hook at the exposed nerve that is the class situation of England.
The scene we've witnessed is part of a film within a film, a gruesome dark comedy that inspires raucous laughter from some troubled city kids being taken by their social workers on a field trip to a rural, run down old Yorkshire mining town to experience a ""different way of life."" Presumably one more purifying and wholesome than the sort of urban cess pool that we assume these kids have grown up in.
The social workers are Jeff, the one focused on fruitlessly teaching the kids all those pointless rules of good suburban life that not even good suburbanites follow, but which we still somehow feel obliged to foist upon our children generation after generation. And his colleague is Kate, a much more down-to-earth pragmatist, able to see things from the kids' point of view. Jeff is pretty soon established as the clown of the movie, and he's the first to get murdered, quite abruptly, beheaded with a meat cleaver.
Do the filmmakers want us to cheer? Be disgusted? Thrilled? Outraged?
To me the takeaway message is that it doesn't matter what the filmmakers think. It's what we think, what we bring to the movie. I'm quite certain that there are plenty of viewers who will watch the scene where two of the kids, Zed and Dwight, are mercilessly killed tortured and killed (one trampled by a horse, the other by having his stomach pumped literally to bursting with  manure (!)) and laugh, cheer, exchange high fives right along with the crowd of inbred country folk, hateful toward the ""civilized"" outsiders. And if you cheer when bad-boy Dwight explodes, you'd be doing the exact same thing that Dwight did at the movie's outset when he was gleefully watching the posh couple get axed. This is what I mean when I say that the movie is fiendishly, almost symphonically arranged to put us in a position where there is no clear moral compass.
Kate manages to escape, along with the two most endearing of the troubled kids, Tim and Sam. Their responses are all different. Sam is incapable of showing any sort of grace under fire. She weeps inconsolably through the whole ordeal (as, I suspect, would many of those armchair libertarian pseudo-intellectuals among us who smugly profess a social Darwinist creed of 'survival of the fittest; let the strong prevail and the weak be crushed). Kate quickly loses any inhibitions toward taking the lives of her enemies. And Tim keeps a (relatively) cool head, managing to plan what ought to be a very satisfying scheme to lure the inbred mob into a dark cellar and blow them all up.
Who prevails? Who survives? Who do you want to survive? And what do your answers say about who you are. Because we spend our time and money on movies in order to discover who we are, who we want to be, and how we might get from the former to the latter. At least that's the way I see it.",1415318400,3,3759,4.54424778761062

If I had known ahead of time what I know now there is no way I would have purchased this movie.  There is nothing that stands out or makes this movie different from any other in it's category.  Of course it's a B movie, but I don't even know if I would rate it as good as a B movie.",1397174400,,425,3.730337078651685
5187685,2,B008X6HSLC,"This movie was too much for me to be honest.  There is a fine line between depravity and simple bloody gore.  Don't read further as I have 1 ""SPOILER ALERT"".  The first real ""kill"" scene had these crazies donning different masks with a circus type atmosphere in what looked to be like an arena.  The onlookers were all shall we say, loony looking.  They took this teenage boy and laid him on the cement floor with his legs spread and arms spread out and took like iron horseshoes and hammered them over his wrists and ankles to immobilize him and brought in a horse.  They put a carrot in his mouth and a switchblade up one nostril and some vegetable up the other nostril and the horse ate the carrot but then 2 girls reminiscent of the twins from ""The Shining"" kept parading the horse around the boy getting a little closer each time until the hoof catches his cheek and takes half his face off and the last scene is the horse hoof actually coming down on his face.  I am a person who does not like when they use animals in movies.  I am a strong advocate against animal cruelty and there is another scene I won't torture you with.  Let me just say I think this movie went too far on the gore to disgust and depravity.  There is a line with me and they definitely crossed it.  I broke the DVD and threw it away.  I guess you know my feelings by that.",1394496000,,1351,4.214007782101167

I suppose if one goes along with the theme of this movie being a dark comedy, then the torture fits.  I would not go so far as to call this a horror flick though as it is a little too stupid and zany to really scare anyone, but maybe one could get away with classifying it as a horror comedy.
