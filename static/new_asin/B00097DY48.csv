2268910,5,B00097DY48,"My daughter loves "" A Pup named Scooby-Doo"" It is a clean and funny cartoon for children of all ages.",1298073600,,101,4.1
2268911,4,B00097DY48,"I like Scooby Doo.  In fact I would say some of my finest cartoon watching memories involve Scooby and the gang.  When my son brought one of these home I turned up my nose, ""it isn't the original.""

But it actually is super cool.  The show makes fun of itself a little, Shaggy is still Casey Kasum, Velma is adorable and when she walks her feet make this little tinky noise.  Daphne is smarter but quite obviously vain.  Fred is ridiculously dense.  Scoob and Shagg are the same loveable characters.

It's a cute show and without being over the top preachy it walks the kids through solving the crimes.  So if you are unfamiliar with a Pup named Scooby Doo, this is a really great show.  Volume 2 has the following episodes: ""For Letter Or Worse,"" ""Babysitter From Beyond,"" ""Snow Place Like Home,"" and ""Now Museum Now You Don't.""",1228348800,,829,4.503355704697986

2268914,5,B00097DY48,"FINALLY! I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am about this show finally being released onto DVD! ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" was one of the best (not to mention funniest) Scooby Doo spin-offs. It ran from 1988-1991 and has had a home on Cartoon Network for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately Cartoon Network has butchered up the show with their non-sense 3 commercial breaks every show, so I am just relieved that this show will finally be releeased commercial-free. If you are a true Scooby Doo fanatic, this DVD is for you.",1117756800,13,537,4.489795918367347
2268955,5,B00097DY48,Both my daughter and I love this show it so much more age appropriate than a lot of newer shows that claim to be for this age range but in my opinion are more adult themed.,1463184000,,172,3.8055555555555554

2268962,5,B00097DY48,"One of my childhood favorites. To this day, I enjoy the creativity & the almost hypnotic energy the show gives to the viewers.

A perfect blend of the classic SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU & the zany antics of the old school Ted Avery-style double-takes & scare-cat screams, the stories are pretty formulaic & predictable, but it's a completely fun ride from start to finish.

In fact, the same animation team that brought us A PUP NAMED SCOOBY-DOO went on to create the insanely popular Warner Bros. Animated series produced by Steven Spielberg himself, TINY TOONY ADVENTURES, ANIMANIACS and the like!",1451865600,,598,4.97
