3822442,1,B001VG2M7Q,the worst movie in the history of movie making. tell rino to stick to armour square beating on minorities his screenplay is as bad as ronald bernbergs breath,1240704000,5,157,4.642857142857143
3822443,4,B001VG2M7Q,The movie arrived in a very timely fashion.  The quality of the movie was good until the middle of the movie.  In certain parts of the movie it stopped and perhaps up to a minute later it began again.,1249776000,,200,4.102564102564102
3822444,1,B001VG2M7Q,"""Baby on Board""  stars Heather Graham and Jerry O'Connell as Angela and Curtis, who have a loving relationship, a comfortable home, and successful careers.  When Angela announces she's pregnant, however, their lives turn into a nine-month comedy of errors in which each suspects the other of cheating.  Now, they must contend with both emotional and hormonal mood swings, as well as the unanticipated drama caused by their friends Danny (John Corbett) and Sylvie (Katie Finneran), who suddenly find their own marriage in peril.  Through all this, Angela worries that her job is in jeopardy as she strives to please her demanding boss (Lara Flynn Boyle).
 Watching a movie like ""Baby On Board,"" one really appreciates star power.  Though the performers are all good and sometimes land the gags with good timing, it's tough to be engaged fully.  O'Connell has the ability to play both the goofy fall guy and the romantic lead, yet here he's somewhere in the middle.  Boyle scores points as the boss from hell, as she manages to elicit sympathy for what could have been a one-note performance. The Blu-ray edition is pretty bare bones, with only the bonus basics -- director commentary, trailer, and photo gallery.",1247270400,6,1211,5.02
3822445,2,B001VG2M7Q,"The movie it self was funny, but the hole experince was destroide by the terrible sound mix. Somtthng ,ust have gone terrible wrong in the Blu-ray mastering both the Dolby DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 HD Master track were filled  with echoes, tapping noice!!!!!",1244937600,3,251,4.704545454545454
3822446,1,B001VG2M7Q,"After work, housework, dinner and laundry I like to sit and watch mindless comedies.  This movies takes mindless to a whole new level!  I kept watching it to the end though, waiting for it to get better.  It NEVER got better.  Filled with bad gags and even worse acting (Heather Graham with her blank stares and a cosmetic surgery nightmare Lara Flynn Boyle who's puffy frozen face had ZERO animation...)this movie was a complete waste of time and money!  Someone should have aborted this project at the get-go!!",1244678400,19,512,4.7727272727272725
3822447,1,B001VG2M7Q,"A truely awful movie.
So to the people that liked it - how much are the studio paying you to write the 5 star reviews?
Pathetic.",1244678400,16,128,3.9615384615384617
3822448,3,B001VG2M7Q,"Everyone involved had way too much fun making this movie. And that's not really a good thing. I did get a good laugh now and then - I really did. But the plot was really ridiculous and contrived. Without giving too much away, the entire movie is based on a couple's (actually two couples') misunderstandings and lack of communication which definitely does happen in every marriage. But when there are issues THAT major, you don't just continue with life, not speaking to each other. You have at least once massive conversation about what's really going on. And that just doesn't happen, allowing things to just drag on. This movie really could have been a lot better if they had spent more time on the storyline. It really felt like a direct to DVD movie.

Okay I'm being kind of harsh. So three things: First of all, the acting is very good. It really is. The main four actors really interacted well with each other all around. The main guys were extremely believable buddies. The women were also great. The movie may be worth watching just for that - but only when there's nothing else and you feel like shutting off your brain for some cheap laughs. The other thing: Lara Flynn Boyle was fabulous as always. And her bad cosmetic surgery actually added to the role of a ball breaker boss aging ungracefully. And third, although the movie as a whole ranks as ""okay"" if I'm generous there are some scenes that will have you saying ""that's totally us"" if you're in a relationship. There are moments of pure genius rarely seen in romantic comedies.

Just one girl's opinion.",1244419200,2,1572,4.630824372759856
3822449,5,B001VG2M7Q,"I Love this movie !  The Dream sequence was great !  I thought this was Heather Graham's best role since ""RollerGirl.""  And Anthony Starke is just brilliant.  I Highly recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.",1244160000,,215,4.578947368421052
3822450,5,B001VG2M7Q,"Don't listen to the bad reviews these wanna be critics, who will never be, are giving this movie.  It is a laugh out loud comedy that is full of outrageous moments, and will make you laugh out loud.  Has a decent script and is acted really well.  If you listen to these other ""retentive"" reviews and pass on this movie, you'll be missing a great comedy..",1243382400,,354,4.333333333333333
3822451,4,B001VG2M7Q,Very entertaining... don't listen to the negative reviews.  It's not a philosophical movie so don't expect to gain any wisdom by watching - but if you want to really laugh and don't mind some raunchiness this film will suit your needs,1243209600,,234,4.7073170731707314
3822452,2,B001VG2M7Q,"This movie seems like part of a trend among many recent romantic comedies to substitute vulgarity and silliness for true comedy. The plot twists were often unbelievable, even for a romantic comedy. At several points, people make out wildly in restaurants, jumping on top of each other and groping wildly (which I've frankly never seen in a public restaurant). After the first 5 minutes there was little change in the plot and the ending was an entirely predictable. Throughout the movie, I felt like the main characters were almost purposely miscommunicating simply because they had to propel the plot. Not worth your time - there are plenty of other romantic comedies about unexpected pregnancies.",1242432000,8,698,5.131578947368421

8346310,1,B001VG2M7Q,"Here's 95 minutes I'll never get back.  It starts out okay but then when they have to create excuses for a BIG communication problem it all goes downhill.  Borderline male bashing doesn't help much either.  Crude and vulgar jokes would make the creators of SOUTH PARK possibly blush.  Well, maybe not but you get the idea.  WHEN WATCHED: Oh God, don't remind me!; MY GRADE: F to D minus.",1287446400,,387,4.550724637681159
8346311,1,B001VG2M7Q,"The DVD version of this movie would make a good coaster, or possibly a Christmas tree ornament. It could be broken and the shards used to perform an emergency tracheotomy. However, under no circumstances should you put this in your DVD player and attempt to watch it. If you do, you will be subjected to one of the most inane scripts ever written, performed by actors whose careers actually decline as you watch.

There is no reason for this movie to exist, except perhaps as an object lesson on how not to make movies.

Watch the INFINITELY superior ""Baby Mama"" instead.",1275091200,,571,4.643564356435643
8346312,3,B001VG2M7Q,"Baby on Board is a bit strange to say the least.

One moment the jokes are innocent, clean, and almost adorable.  The next minute the style of humor switches completely into a much dirtier and downright *disgusting* direction.

I assume this was done because the writers wanted to make this film a comedy for both men and women alike.  The problem is, men and women will be spending much of their time either bored or disgusted (and probably confused).

I don't know what else to say about it.  I was laughing quite hard on a few occasions, but other times I couldn't believe the words the characters were saying to each other (and I don't mean cute and innocent little swear words either).

The story involving a pregnant woman going through her hectic career without her boss knowing she's actually pregnant was the only time my interest went up for a short period.

Don't expect Baby on Board to be a comedy that pertains to your sense of humor because frankly, a movie like this isn't able to connect to *anyones* sense of humor.",1270425600,,1033,4.576086956521739
8346313,1,B001VG2M7Q,"This movie is truly one of the most terrible ones I have ever seen. The movie is full of VERY vulgar, shocking content along with an overdone amount of mindless swearing and it has a very unbelievable, shallow plot. Blech. I wish I could forget this movie. This movie goes beyond crude. I could not believe the nudity and vulgarity in it. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this.",1268179200,3,380,4.442857142857143
8346314,1,B001VG2M7Q,IT IS A BAD COMEDY WITH 1 OR 2 LAUGHS AND VERY VULGAR. THE ONLY POINT IS BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF THE BLU-RAY VERSION IS REALLY GOOD.,1267920000,,131,3.888888888888889

8346316,1,B001VG2M7Q,"(Note: It's hard to imagine that I could spoil this movie for anyone, but the list below does contain ""spoilers"")

BABY ON BOARD is the kind of unromantic noncomedy that is so bad that you will be tempted to press the pause button multiple times to wonder aloud to your partner, your cat, or (if viewing alone) your nearest houseplant:

1) After that dopey summation, why is everyone in the movie treating Jerry O'Connell like a really smart lawyer?
2) Is that really Lara Flynn Boyle?
3) Did any of these actors actually read the script?
4) Would any pregnant woman really stop strangers in the street to tell them she's not pregnant (when they don't care, and she knows she really is)?
5) Wouldn't it be great to see Heather Graham in a decent movie?
6) Isn't there a limit to the number lame/offensive/fart jokes you can put in a single movie?
7) If Jerry O'Connell really were a really smart lawyer, why, when wrongly accused of adultery, wouldn't he simply tell his wife she's wrong?
8)) Why would Heather Graham, when accused of carrying another man's baby, not simply tell her dim bulb/really smart lawyer husband he's wrong?
9) Can anyone really get away with going to work for nine months while keeping her pregnancy a secret?
10) I try not to write negative reviews, but shouldn't I warn people about this one?

Of course, some movies are so bad that you can enjoy them for their sheer awfulness.  I can't even offer you that consolation about BABY ON BOARD.",1254009600,8,1468,4.591603053435114
