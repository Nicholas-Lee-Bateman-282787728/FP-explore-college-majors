8660598,3,B00KPI1HA4,"It is a play that has been filmed, not a movie adaptation of a play.  Understand that, and you'll know what to expect for set and acting.

It was pretty good.  Music fairly clever, etc.

The main thing that could have been better was the makeup (probably the only believable, or at least not-distractingly-bad, makeup job was the girl who was covered in blood.)

Oh, and the sound mix needed work, parts of the movie were louder than others, so I had to actually change the volume as I watched.",1519776000,,494,4.444444444444445
8660599,4,B00KPI1HA4,"Very dry and faithful sendup of _My Fair Lady_. I stopped about 20 minutes in to watch the original. Very much a stage play, and the musical numbers are highly amusing, so listen carefully.",1511913600,,189,4.588235294117647

8660601,3,B00KPI1HA4,"Truly, not at all comparable to the Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison version.

That said, if you'd never seen either of the big screen adaptations then you might find this enjoyable ... in a loose, high school or college-level zombie-parody production of a musical comedy.

The costumes were period and the lyrics were adequate, but the accompanying music lacked the fullness that you'd expect from almost any mainstream musical.

Quite frankly, I've heard children's live stage productions utilizing a pit orchestra of a dozen instrumentalists crank out better music.",1460851200,,567,5.348314606741573
8660602,4,B00KPI1HA4,"Not for your run of the mill zombie enthusiast, but fun for a musical.",1455926400,,70,4.071428571428571
8660603,4,B00KPI1HA4,"This is a zombie comedy with a few musical numbers. I believe most of us know the story on ""My Fair Lady"" and will be entertained by the similarities. Of course like most adaptations of  Pygmalion, this one take liberties also, most noticeably, the zombie aspect. The second variation (plot spoiler) is that the classic flower girl who we think will become Eliza Doolittle.... well you'll see.

The film spoofs itself and the British aristocracy as a group of prudish people who sit around on nice furniture and annoyingly stir their tea. There were a number of scenes that were too long and started to get boring in spite of the decent performances.

Not much in the way of zombie horror.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1451606400,2,726,4.692913385826771
8660604,5,B00KPI1HA4,"Ok, so I was a bit skeptical...a zombie musical? It was actually quite good! Good actors with amazingly good voices. They had a decent budget and I ended up smiling through the whole thing. If you like zombies and musicals (yup, I do) then give it a chance. I was glad I did. Good job with this production!",1409961600,,306,4.293103448275862
8660605,4,B00KPI1HA4,"OK, 1st off  -I'm a little biased, so I'll admit it - my father is one of the leads!  :)

That being said, as a zombie genre fan, objectively, this is a something a little different,  -and that's a good thing - than all the endless zombie b-flicks coming out. With great musical numbers, dark humour, and a great zombie lead. For what I assume was a very modest budget, this film is more entertaining, original and fun than most of the endless tripe out there!  Give it a try -you won't be disappointed!",1403913600,5,503,4.308510638297872
