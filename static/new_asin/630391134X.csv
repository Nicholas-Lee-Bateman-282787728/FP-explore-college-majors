724079,5,630391134X,"Taking place in the mid-Seventies when the Argentine military dictatorship brutally murdered many of its own citizens, a cildless married couple (Hector Alterio and Norma Aleandro) decide to adopt a young girl during this period of torture.  Aleandro suspects their daughter is one of ""los desparecidos"" (the disappeared ones) but the husband prefers to look the oher way. Aleandro gives a great performance, choosing to accept the truth about her ""adopted daughter"" and breaks with her husband after he brutally beats her.  One of the best Argentine films from director Luis Puenzo.

I teach this film in my Lat. Am.

This thing moves way too slow to have any impact in 2009 when I saw it. The problem is you can see exactly where the story is going. No surprises at all really as the script telegraphs everything.

The only powerful scene I connected with was the mothers of the disappeared in central Buenos Aires.

724155,5,630391134X,"This is one of the most emotionally powerful political films I have ever seen. We witness an Argentine history teacher's awakening to the truth behind her daughter's adoption.  It was filmed shortly after the fall of Argentina's military dictatorship.  During the dictatorship in the late 1970s and early 1980s there were tens of thousands of Argentines including children who Disappeared without a trace.  Today(2010) visitors to Buenos Aires can still see the mothers and grandmothers marching and protesting for an accounting of their missing relatives.

When I first saw this at a film festival shortly after its release in the 1980s, I knew nothing about the Disappeared.  Since then I have become a social dancer of the Argentine tango. So I decided to watch the DVD with this different perspective...and an interest inArgentina's history.  The dictatorship forbid tango dancing for political reasons.  A scene in which one of the characters relates that during a raid on her apartment her poster of Gardel was torn to ""shreds"" hints at that.  Dancers were arrested if they gathered for milongas.  Most American tango dancers that I know do not know this part of tango's history.

I highly recommend this film.",1280793600,3,1216,5.126903553299492
724156,5,630391134X,"""La historia oficial"" (""The Official Story"", 1985) is the second in what I consider to be a trilogy of films dealing with political repression and its consequences in Argentina, and by extension universally.  The film is about a secondary school history teacher, her ""well connected"" businessman husband and their 5 year old adopted daughter.  At least the official story is that the daughter is adopted.  The mother begins to question the adoption and unusual events surrounding how her husband unexpectedly brought their baby home 5 years earlier.  She begins to search for records of the birth and the natural parents and can find none.  The only thing that is clear is that her husband is lying and hiding something.  Meanwhile, her husband's company is having some sort of political trouble.  As the mother investigates more, she encounters an older woman who she believes is the natural grandmother of her daughter.  The conflict between the mother, the possible natural grandmother, the husband, his family, his business, his lies and the changing political situation provides the dramatic movement to the unexpected conclusion.

The film was made in 1985, two years after the fall of the military dictatorship of the 1970s and early 80s.  The Argentine audience would have been very familiar with the constant demonstrations of the ""Madres de la Plaza de Mayo"" (Mothers of the Plaza) who were  demanding to know what happened to their children who disappeared during the military dictatorship.  As we know today, many of their children were tortured and killed and the women who were pregnant were kept prisoners until the birth of the child.  The babies were then adopted by political sympathizers and the mothers killed.  This is a tough film dealing with an unbelievably tough subject; but it is well worth viewing for a mature audience.  The other two films that deal with the history and consequences of political repression are ""Camila"" (1984) and ""Vidas privadas""(Private Lives, 2001).",1263772800,7,2000,5.148606811145511
724157,5,630391134X,"This is a beautiful, extraordinarily well crafted film about the aftermath of the Dirty War in Argentina from 1976 to 1983. There are several contexts that director Puenzo features in this excellent screenplay.

 Alicia, the heroine of this film (played by Norma Aleandro) is a high school Argentine History teacher. Her students, by utilizing their own critical abilities and independent research, help her to realize that history is not just about the regime-certified ""facts"" but rather about freedom, memory and truth. The national anthem at the beginning of the film speaks to Argentine ideals about freedom.

 Alicia's character grows and changes, with help from the Grandmothers, who were actually the parents of the disappeared, and other peaceful protesters that call for truth, and the recovery of their grandchildren who were taken from their parents at birth while in captivity by the Argentine military. This film works beautifully level through its alignment of the personal and the historical changes, with Alicia representing the former.

 The society and the individual both undergo monumental development during this era. As Ana, the friend of Alicia, suggests when she finally confronts Alicia's husband Roberto, the ship may well be sinking. It is also interesting to see how the protesters connect, and draw in support from Argentinians, over the loss of the War in the Malvinas/Falklands with the evilness of the military rulers. (One can only wonder what would have happened if Hitler had not lost the war with the Soviet Union, which was a decisive battleground in the Second World War).

 It is also gratifying see how Ana confronts the former classmate, who heartlessly turns a blind eye to the suffering and unspeakable atrocities that had been waged in this Dirty War against people like Ana, who fortunately got away to Europe before returning to a newer, more enlightened Argentina that is just beginning to grow up, a growing up that reflects a return to its ideals and principles expressed in its national anthem in the opening scene. This film is a work of art that speaks to the need for truth, for justice, for democracy and is a message well worth repeating to people everywhere.",1247529600,3,2215,5.116343490304709
724158,3,630391134X,"The Bottom Line:

I salute this film for trying to uncover an awful chapter in Argentinian history, but it's so understated and slow for the majority of its running length that it never quite manages to qualify as entertainment; if you're interested in the subject you might want to check it out, but I think the average viewer will not come away thrilled.

724159,4,630391134X,"La Historia Official is a well-made film about awakening from passive complicity in evil, in this case, forced adoption. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo were and are an inspiration to those who struggle to uncover and resist abuses in adoption practices, be they the enslaved Irish women of the Magdalen laundries or the many indigenous peoples who had children forcibly removed from homes to be adopted by whites. Most of adoption does not involve abduction, but to turn a blind eye to the fact that it does exist, is to be passively complicit, as was the protagonist in this film.

The scene in which the teacher realizes that tremendous evil has indeed been perpetrated, and that she may very well be the beneficiary of such evil, is staggering. Norma Aleandro is a talented enough actress that we believe her initial rejection of this revelation, and her gradual evolution from passive cohort to courageous seeker of the truth.",1216339200,3,937,4.8930817610062896

724215,5,630391134X,"I first saw THE OFFICIAL STORY in one of the Spanish courses I took at the University of Washington.  My teacher was from Argentina and the film definitely spoke to her in a distinctive way, since she was a product of that nation and knew, firsthand, the goings on of the government with ""Los Desaparecidos"" (The Disappeared Ones).  It was a fleet of intellectuals, old people, young people, men and women all considered a threat to Argentinean government (or subversive), who were mysteriously disappeared by the government, tortured, raped, and, in many cases, killed for speaking their minds openly about the state of political affairs.

This beautifully made film won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1985.  THE OFFICIAL STORY was sensitively directed by Luis Puenzo, starring Norma Aleandro, Hector Alterio and Chuchuna Villafane.  Alicia (Norma Aleandro) is a teacher at an all boys school and fails to make a real connection with people of any age, much less the students she interacts with on a daily basis.  She and her husband, Roberto (Hector Alterio) have adopted a little girl and it isn't until Alicia has a chance encounter with her friend, Ana (Chunchuna Villafane) that she becomes aware of the bleak reality of the disappeared ones, and begins to wonder whether her adoptive daughter might be a descendant of one of them.

This film is raw, unrepentant and very, very well done.  I think all people should see this, to get a better sense of the state of Argentina's government, the treatment of its people at the hands of a brutal dictatorship, and also to experience truly beautiful cinema.",1188172800,5,1631,4.948717948717949
724216,4,630391134X,"Cry for me Argentina. Back in the early 80's Argentina went through hard times economically.  Actually, the country before the 1930's was one of the most prosperous in the world. They exported beef and raw materials.  Their economy was fueled especially with British money that built the railroads and infrostructure.  The cities were modern.  Then it all dried up.  The Peronists took over, a populist-quasi-fascist-socialist group and they gave way to a military juanta.  Corruption and violence continued for the the next 30 years.

The most famous event during the 80's, the suppression of the Left by the Military. Many of those dissappearing into prisions were students and childbearing women.  They were raped, tortured and murdered, literally vanishing into thin air.  Some of the babies were adopted no questions asked. So there is the setting for this heartrendering story of the aftermath of that period.  It is riviting and one of the few pro-lefty films that didn't want to make me throw up. It's even handed enough because it keeps the politics under control and emphasizes the human condition.",1186444800,,1108,5.139664804469274

724221,5,630391134X,"The Official Story is an excellent example of how to mix political cinema with human drama, avoiding agitprop or crude sloganeering to put a human face on the issue of Argentina's disappeared - in particular the children taken away from undesirables and given to well-connected families who won't ask any questions. When one well-heeled adopted mother learns of this and begins to suspect that her adopted daughter may be one of those children, rather than turn into a sermon the film focuses on her own fears as she tries to disprove the possibility until ultimately she is in the same uncertain hell as the families of the disappeared - she can suspect, but she can never truly know.

Although some of the devices may seem a little too schematic - she's a history teacher who depends solely on the `verifiable' official version of her country's history - it wears them lightly and is often extremely powerful. The Best Foreign Film Oscar has a rather dubious history, but this is definitely one of the more deserving winners.",1142985600,4,1027,4.8352272727272725
724222,5,630391134X,"One of the most powerful stories I've ever seen on screen is The Official Story. It tells of a mother who learns the truth about her adopted daughter.

The story is set in Argentina in the 1980s. Alicia is a high school teacher who talks with her students daily about the events that go on around her. She has a lawyer husband and an adopted 5 year old daughter. Her life seems pretty ideal.

Suddenly, Alicia is given a hint that her daughter wasn't given to her through a traditional adoption - that in fact the young girl was orphaned by government action and was stolen from her proper family.  This was the time of the ""Desaparecidos"" - the ""disappeared"". Some estimate that 30,000 or more Argentians were massacred during this period of political unrest. Alicia's husband denies that their child is involved in this situation. Alicia becomes more and more curious, doing investigations into the actual history of what happened.

Alicia knows little of what her husband actually ""does"". She sees him as a strong but loving man. As she begins to assert her own independence, though, her husband becomes more and more controlling.

In fact, the movie has a ""R"" rating but throughout most of the movie, nothing scary happens. The dialogue tells you about the tortures and evils that happened without actually showing any. It demonstrates how petrified current Argentinians are, while only hinting at the reason. The core reason for that R rating comes in the last 10 minutes of the film.

At this point, Alicia knows for sure that her child was stolen from her rightful family after the parents were slain. Alicia has brought the daughter to the grandma's house so that she and her husband can discuss the issue without the daughter being present. The husband, however, thinks that Alicia has returned the child to her ""real family"" and gets upset. He brutally attacks his wife, slamming her fingers in a door jam and slamming her head on the ground. When Alicia is finally able to gasp out that the daughter is just somewhere safe, the husband is apologetic - but the damage is done. Alicia has realized just how brutal her husband is and what he is capable of. She leaves.

The behavior of the husband towards Alicia mimics the behavior of the Argentinian government towards its people. In both cases the attitude was one of paternal control, with violence always at the ready if things did not go just the way that was wanted.

From a domestic violence standpoint, the movie shows that you can often never know what someone is truly like until you are in a tough situation. Alicia thought her husband was a bit controlling but generally OK through her years of marriage. She didn't suspect that he could physically attack her. However, when the first ""test"" was reached, the husband's immediate reaction was to beat her up to find out the answers he needed. It was a part of his personality that had always been there. When Alicia realized that, she left him.",1139529600,18,2964,4.73062015503876
724280,5,630391134X,"We watched this movie in my Modern Latin America class.  It moved me to tears.  What happened in Argentina in that period, la guerra sucia and los desaparecidos is something which must be exposed so that it never happens again.  This movie is subtile - it never shows torture or killing, although perhaps up to 30,000 Argentines dissapeared, but it shows the CULTURE OF FEAR that they were living in, and how it even created rifts within the same family.

724282,4,630391134X,"Up until today, I would have given this wonderful movie, which we watched in my Spanish class, 5+ stars.  But I did not at all like the ending; it very much ruined it for me.  I'm a person who needs closure.  Yes, this was a movie demonstrating a tragic topic and should be sad.  But that was just cruel, to end with the poor little girl singing about how she's so lost.  We don't know her fate.

I also felt that Roberto was a sort of villainized character.  He had a point about Gaby having to lose another mother.  I hope that Alicia, when she left, was going to get Gaby.  What I would like to know is what they decided to do with Sara, her possible grandmother.  Again, I need closure!  I was expecting a depressing ending, but not to be left hanging like this!  Arghhhhh.

I also had a problem with Gaby's having been born in captivity.  It makes that scene where the little boys suddenly burst into her room kind of pointless; it's meaningful, powerful, and was one of my favorite scenes untiL I realized she was just startled.  I guess it still has meaning, but, I dunno.  Just my being nitpicky, I guess.

I also want to know who Pedro was.  Also, what Gaby's possible parents did that got them arrested.  I realize that it could have been something very minor, but it would be nice to know.  For all I know they all could have been gun-toting revolutionaries.

Overall though, it was a wonderful movie and I am considering buying it myself.  I especially loved the scenes involving Las Madres y Abuelas de la Playa de Mayo.  And the acting was fantastic.  I just am bothered by all of these questions that are never answered.",1115942400,2,1635,4.373333333333333
724283,5,630391134X,"I used this film in my upper level high school Spanish class.  The students, without exception, immediately became emotionally involved with the characters and the powerful story line.  They could not believe this was a part of history they were not aware of and even questioned their history teachers as to why there is no mention of this in their classrooms.

Along with the movie, we did extensive research on the ""desaparecidos"" and they read a few real stories of children who had been ""adopted"" only to find out as adults that their entire life had been a lie.

What surprised my students most of all was the relatively lenient treatment the perpetrators of this heinous crime received after being found guilty.

This movie, and topic, is suitable for an upper level high school class (4th year and up).  I recommend that you prepare the students beforehand by doing some research on the topic and period of Argentinian history.  It would also be valuable to research the link between the military dictator of Argentina at the time and the government of the U.S.",1095811200,48,1068,4.80327868852459
724284,5,630391134X,"This actress is phenomenal in this role. She IS Alicia and her portrayal of coming to terms with Argentina's dirty war secrets is the most compelling acting I've seen in my life. She is simply remarkable and the film's power and emotion center on her flawless portrayal.
Some heart-wrenching moments:
When she gently unfolds her baby's cloth diaper, long saved in a box of momentos from her infancy, or when she snuggles up to little Gaby, holding tight to her child, the woman's agony becomes so real that you forget that you're watching a movie and your heart feels the pain of her situation.
I've seen this movie at least 10 times and I find myself still tearing up when Norma performs Alicia so masterfully.
An interesting symbol I've noticed in the film:
The opening and closing of doors.
----Alicia watching the doors swing back and forth while witnessing the birth of a child in the hospital
----Alicia seeing a door at Roberto's office suddenly close, to hide a criminal act in progress
----Roberto closing the door on her fingers, as if to keep her from passing through the door
----Alicia's departure, the silence leading up to the heavy close of the door, as we see her profile finally pass through.
(These are the examples that come to mind. I'm sure there are more)
In the context of Argentine history in the mid 1980's, the country itself was passing through a door to democracy.

If not for the subtitle issue I would have given the film a full five stars. It is extremely well crafted and reflects an important period in Argentina's history. Also, it gives students an opportunity to experience the use of the ""vos"" in the Ro de la Plata region. I really want to find a DVD of this film with subtitles in Spanish!

Rated PG
Argentinean director Luis Puenzos The Official Story, winner of the 1985 Best Foreign Film Oscar, is a film that deserves to be better known, especially by those interested in peacemaking and social justice. Alicia Marnet de Ibez is both a housewife with a little adopted daughter and a high school history teacher in Buenos Aires. The time is right after the Dirty War, around 1983 when the military dictatorship that had murdered thousands of opponents has lost power. Alicias husband Roberto, a prosperous lawyer with strong ties to the old dictatorship, had come home one night five years earlier with a baby girl whom they name Gaby. He had refused to tell how he came by her, ordering her not to ask any questions. She meekly complied.

At school her students, very much against the old regime, consider her ignorant of what has been going on in the world. They are distrustful of the official story of history, declaring that history is written by assassins. Also a fellow teacher talks with her about the political situation.

Alicia grows more curious and concerned about the circumstances of the adoption after meeting with Ana, an old friend who had dropped out of sight years before without saying goodbye. Ana reveals that she had been arrested, tortured, and sent out of the country immediately. She mentions that several of the prisoners had been pregnant women whose children had been taken away and given to wealthy couples.

Fearfully setting out to find the truth, Alicia tries to find out about the birth mother at hospitals, but receives little help. Along the way she meets Sara, a member of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo. The latter is the huge public square where a large circle of women march around carrying placards with slogans and pictures of those who have disappeared. The grandmothers and mothers are demanding to know the fate of their stolen children and other loved ones.

Sara assumes at first that Alicia is seeking the fate of her own child, but eventually learning the truth, she is brought together with Gabyand when he returns home, with Roberto. The resulting tragic confrontation marks the end of Alicias marriage, but the beginning of her emergence into responsible adulthood. Whenever I read a theologian writing about conscienticization, the process of the oppressed coming to an awareness of their situation and moving to correct it, I think of this film as the perfect example. The characters are fictional but the details are true to life.
