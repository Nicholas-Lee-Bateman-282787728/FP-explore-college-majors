4953265,5,B0064SVM5Y,"This is a very nice tribute to one of the all-time comic greats.  Bernie Mac was very unique with his comedy and he made everyone laugh.  The tributes given by Chris Rock, DL Hughley, etc... were very on point and gave you insight into why everyone loved him and still misses him.",1330214400,14,280,4.365384615384615
4953266,5,B0064SVM5Y,"Biased as I knew Bernie but critical in watching his story told. So glad you mentioned the Regal theater. Spoke to his family and friends. hey spoke 100% real of his personality. No more I could say. We have a huge void in comedy and classic, good, down home, real, Chicago-style (the greats do some from here--Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor's roots, Robin Harris, Cloris Leachment,the Bulushi brothers) comedic natural-ness. Very much missed. Very much.",1329609600,15,448,5.0675675675675675

4953313,3,B0064SVM5Y,"This collection of irreverent comedic riffs on the philosophy of black life as told by the ""Mac Man"" himself, is funny, serious, and full of life, and of life's truths. It covers unvarnished, the full menu of foibles of black life as they are seen through Bernie's eyes, and as they are lived in the ghettos across America each day.

Bernie does not pull his punches as he speaks the truth about the trials and tribulations of America's ghetto streets. As told here, those streets are sometimes ugly; often beautiful, but always as raw truths about reality as they emerge directly from ""the Mac Man's"" heart and mouth.

Like most of us, Bernie Mac too dodged more than just a few bullets before he found his way: He kept pushing forward against all obstacles until both his passion and his dream for his true calling, emerged. Surely it would have been impossible without the formidably close triangular bond between him, his wife and his daughter.

One wonders whether the shortness of his life was due entirely to being caught-up in the meat-grinder of the fast lane of Hollywood success, or just part of the ugly demographic statistical reality of black male life in America's ghettos?

And while written comedy does not have the same ""zing"" as night club stand-up, here those familiar with Bernie's shtick will still get more than just a whiff of the authentic Bernie Mack.

And it must be said, that even in his afterlife, ""the Mac Man"" still reigns unchallenged at the top of the comedic hill: He is still king of the self-anointed ""Kings of Comedy."" And it seems that he is unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon?

However, I still have my money on a not so youthful but once hot comedic genius out of Queens New York called ""Capone."" Capone burned up the Def Jam stage about a decade ago, as Bernie had done before him, yet seems to have faded in the stretch run?

I did see him briefly on ""Shaq's Comedy Special,"" but have not seen him since. As talented as ""Capone"" is, it's just a matter of time before some talent scout is going to recognize that he is the ""real deal"" and put him back in the limelight. I am still pulling for him to emerge as the heir to the ""Bernie Mac throne."" Three stars.",1456185600,2,2204,4.5365239294710324

I didn't want him to stop but I needed him to leave that stage so I could breathe again! He was a truly great comedian, phenomenal entertainer and could steal the spotlight from anybody.  In my family we do Bernie quotes all the time, 'Let's move along, America.'  'You summab-----'  'I swear 'fore the Lawd', and 'trouble, trouble, trouble'.  Just thinking about him saying these things makes me smile.  Coworkers and I spent a lunch hour talking about how Bernie showed the world how to use the word, well, you know, the mother word. People still talk about how he closed Kings of Comedy with that! Nobody but Bernie could have done that and made it not only believable, understandable but hilariously funny.
