There is a lot of food for thought in this series, especially one story in particular.....Very good DRAMA.",1377734400,,240,4.853658536585366
8456469,5,B00549I3II,"As other reviewers on this board have stated, if you liked the first season of ""Street"" you will certainly like Season two (2).  Season two (2) on two(2) discs with six (6) marvelous episodes running about an hour and one-half each contains some of the most wonderfully written scripts  that are acted sublimely that  I have ever seen on the big screen or small screen.  Through all of the episodes, I was in total amazement of how really, really good this BBC presentation is.  Mother of god, ""Street"" is so well written, directed and, most of all, greatly acted.

Once again the stories in Season two (2), as in the first season, are about ordinary ""everyday"" happenings that evolve into life changing events.  Each episode is about ordinary ""working class"" people living on a lower middle class street in Northern England that are living very ordinary lives experiencing  what start out as very ordinary events such as:  going to work, arguing with neighbors, taking a taxi, going to school or a social event or going to the store or a nightclub, walking down the street, etc.  These ordinary events or happenings morph into ""life changing"" happenings that completely change the ordinary people's lives that are being portrayed.  The ""everyday"" happenings that become ""life changing"" events are: murder, out of the ordinary ""extra marital affairs""; deteriorating relationships between mother and children, husband and wife and families being torn asunder, etc.

If you want to be highly entertained and to be ""awed"" at some marvelous ""TV viewing"" get Season two (2) of ""Street"" because, I feel, that it is great.",1317600000,6,1615,4.985074626865671
