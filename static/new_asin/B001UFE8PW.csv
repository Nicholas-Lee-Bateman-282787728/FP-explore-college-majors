3798221,5,B001UFE8PW,"My daughter's review:

Ok, so this show is fun. Don't expect great acting (except from Alex Marriott, aka Scooter - He rocks!), don't expect great plot lines/scripts, don't expect tons of horsey stuff (I wish there were MORE horse plots. Sometimes there are too many ""people"" side stories that just don't matter to me. I want horses!

But, like I said, Max and Scooter, especially Scooter, can really act. Alex Marriott is completely charming and hilarious. He pulls off an Irish accent perfectly! He is my favorite character on the series (not to mention the cutest) and I really enjoyed the Veronica/Scooter romance plot. Thanks, Alex, for some great acting and hilarious moments!",1270339200,,682,5.0265486725663715

These DVD's teach learner riders so much about horse-care, safety, gear and riding positions that I wish they had been available when my own children were learning to ride.
