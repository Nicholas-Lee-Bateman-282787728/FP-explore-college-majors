4858192,3,B005QBST4C,"Porkchop is more of an 80's set horror comedy than an 80's style one.  Some of the jokes are actually pretty funny and the actresses are cute, but this could have used more nudity and gore--there isn't nearly enough of either for this one to merit a strong recommendation.",1327968000,2,272,4.551020408163265
4858193,1,B005QBST4C,I thought this movie was bad.  I am going to throw away my copy.  The actors were unprofessional and silly.  I just did not like this movie and I am angry at myself for buying it.  Like I said:  What did I miss?  Total waste of my time.,1326153600,,236,3.8125
4858194,3,B005QBST4C,"Porkchop is a new slasher movie that pays homage to slasher classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th. Unfortunately, despite some cool moments here and there and a few laughs, it is lacking. The killer in this one wears a pig mask, and he is an awesome killer. The trouble is that he really doesn't get that much screen time. There is some decent gore, but some of the deaths aren't that great. And I was expecting more humor than I got, being that this is supposed to be a satire. Don't expect the brilliant silliness of Caesar And Otto's Summer Camp Massacre. The movie does have some T & A, and even some brief male nudity for the ladies and gay men. Porkchop is okay, but it could have been so much more.",1323561600,4,725,4.338235294117647
4858195,5,B005QBST4C,One Word - Brilliant. Some films just turn out to be so good that words just don't seem to be enough to describe it. Watch it. Seriously.,1321315200,3,137,4.111111111111111
4858196,5,B005QBST4C,"Very inventive and enthusiastic slasher movie, great villain!  Not a high-budget, but it's refreshing to see effects instead of CGI.  pop some popcorn and bring your sick twisted sense of humor!",1321142400,3,194,5.225806451612903
4858197,1,B005QBST4C,There is a wavy set of lines on the DVD...like it was created in production.  It's not scratched.  It is a wavy looking thing on there that makes it freeze...didn't even get past the credits,1374451200,,190,4.4
4858198,1,B005QBST4C,"Well, I'd been kind of looking forward to seeing this movie, as it had a cool hand drawn cover of the title character and the tagline bragged of 80's style horror. I was really hoping that I'd have some fun with this film, so I decided to pop it in tonight and see what it was all about. Well, what it seemed to be all about was breaking the cardinal rule of low budget horror films: Do Not Be Boring!

Porkchop is a no-budget movie shot on video, and it starts off terribly with an awful heavy metal tune titled ""Porkchop"" running over the opening credits of real footage of pigs being butchered in a slaughterhouse. As far as disturbing, or gross, this would be the highlight of the film.

It's the classic tale of getting a group of buddies together to go on a camping trip out in the woods where a rural legend just happens to still be around. We have six ""buddies"", and one robot. You heard me right, a robot is among the cast for the entire movie, spouting off terrible one liners and being the most annoying of all of the annoying characters in the movie. That's another big no-no that this movie has in store for us. There is not one character to root for in the film. Not one of them would we miss if they ended up on the end of Porkchop's chainsaw. The only thing that seemed to matter to me was hoping that all of the female characters got topless at least once. That one wish was almost fulfilled, as our lead female character does not lose her clothes during the film.

There were some characters that were so bad at acting that I wondered if there was even a script being used at some points. Some of the lines being read, or made up were so poorly acted that I wanted to hide my face in shame for them. I sure hope they got paid well, but somehow I doubt it. Taking a camera into the woods, and filming your friends trying to do scary things can be fun for the people doing it, but not always fun for the people that get to watch what you've made out of it.

The film had no sense of urgency, no atmosphere, no tension, and worst of all, no action at all until the one hour mark. Any attempts among the characters to make any type of jokes or humor fall completely flat. The only interesting time I had was during the campfire scene when the legend of Porkchop was told. It seemed to be the only part of the movie that drew me in for a few minutes, and was quickly discarded as the characters reverted back to their boring nature after that one scene was completed. No matter how many times the actors referenced different 80's icons, it did not look or feel anything like an 80's film like it had been advertised as. And seeing female teenage (supposedly) characters with tattoos and tramp stamps didn't help create any 80's vibe either.

Yes, this film was a disappointment for a lot of reasons. As little as I could let myself get into the film, I still saw mistakes that the filmmakers must have seen themselves and didn't want to, or couldn't afford to fix. A girl has no flashlight in one scene, then suddenly she has one in the next. Even so bad as to start a kill with a long handled buzz saw, and finish the scene with the killer holding a chainsaw. Inexcusable. There is no reason at all that you should need to see this film, unless you choose morbid curiosity, and then you'll just be torturing yourself. 2/10.",1372032000,,3337,4.265402843601896
4858199,2,B005QBST4C,And didn't see any.  I bought this on a recommendation and was left disappointed.  Avoid this movie unless you just can't control your curiosity.,1364601600,2,145,5.0

4858201,1,B005QBST4C,"They play up a whole 80s vibe throughout the promotion of the film but it is NOTHING like an 80s film; sure there in the woods, woods that look like there probably there backyard. But  never in my day was there a cardboard robot dropping bad one liners, fake british guys who are just so annoying you pray for there death a stooped killer bad effects horrible acting and s***ty directing. This film is a waist of time and as a long time lover of slasher films, trust me ive seen them all and this is easily one of the worst. It makes ""Killer Workout"" seem like a piece of gold. I don't think the guy that made this film was old enough to really understand the 80s mind set. He basically took every stereo type and tossed it in a really stooped film. I guess in his mind the 80 was all day glow and synth pop shirtless girls woods that are .....just woods; i don't know how long i can keep reviewing this film it is making me think about it to much and that is stressing me out . Ok, so ill do a quick list as to why this film sucks.
1."" The woods"". now if your setting a film, a horror film a SLASHER film in the woods you have to pick woods with personality, or at least dense enough to look creepy dark cluttered so its hard for the victims to run through not a pile of sticks that anyone can get out of or see what is coming.
2.""The robot"" I understand that it seemed funny when smoking pot with your buds because there were quite a few robot films in the 80s but if your going to blend genres please do it well and make the robot look like a robot not cardboard. and rethink the one liners and the idea that a robot can have sex a feel pleasure please, your getting into dumb territory why you didn't see that i don't know.
3. ""the Killer"" There is such a small back story as to why it kills that it doesn't even need to be there, something about a childhood in a slaughterhouse ""Texas Chainsaw"" A history of brutal killings ""every film ever made"". See wear i am going with this.
4. "" the pig mask"" Motel Hell, if you know your 80s films like you say you do you would know that the pig head was used in motel hell and to iconic degrees. Things like a hockey mask come on man cant copy classic films with out real 80s fans calling you on it.
5. ""Boobs"" ok ill give that one to ya there were allot of boobs and you can never go wrong with boobs in a slasher film.

So basically i didn't even get to the horrible plot the bad fake british guy the annoying ""and not in a funny good way"" kids, the bad special effects bla bla bla , you get the point, it looks like it was shot on a cheep vhs camera which has a certain charm to it but this film production wise seems to take itself to seriously for that so there is no depth to the film rather it looks cold and cheep.
Just avoid this crap and call it a day.",1359244800,,2807,3.99288256227758
4858202,1,B005QBST4C,"I'm glad I didn't pay much for this, but what I did pay, was not worth it.  This is a poorly-made indie film, that is supposed to take place in the 80's, but that aspect is just as unconvincing as the rest of the film.  The usual group of brainless teens go to the woods to get slaughtered by the usual stereotyped dude in a pig mask with a chainsaw.  You've seen it before, and it's been done better.  Don't bother.",1342656000,3,416,4.098765432098766
4858203,4,B005QBST4C,"Ok. I give it four stars. The first hour of this movie kind of drags though. It would have been nice after the inital killings in the beginning if there was something else within that first hour. With that being said, the last half hour really moves along and is FUN! Loved the original killings. Rob Cobb, who plays Porkchop, did an outstanding job in both Porkchop and Porkchops. I assume he is the killer in the 3D version they are working on now. He really nailed the part and is honestly one of the best parts of the movie. Camera work and angles were used very nicely. Loved the original killings and for an indie film they did a good job with the effects. I am a huge fan of 3D so I am really looking forward to the third one as well.",1336694400,5,741,4.152777777777778
4858204,1,B005QBST4C,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not even the nudity could save this film. Your time and money would be better spent doing anything else. Dont recommend this film for anyone,1334707200,,182,4.382352941176471
4858205,2,B005QBST4C,"I have had this movie for a month or two but just got around to watching it (I have a DVR box and always have something to watch).  I took the time to get to my many DVDs waiting for me.  I picked this one first, unfortunately.  This starts out normal.  Kids camping in the woods.  The pig mask the killer wears does look authentic which bothered me.  There is a scene at the beginning credits which disturbed me greatly (an actual pig being beaten in the head), not for me, I fastforwarded.  There is a kill scene that is most unnerving with the cheerleader in the tree and what was it with the fetus?? It looked like a Buddha baby and had green blood when it was stomped on.  Ick!!!!!! The girl did not even look pregnant and wore her cheerleading outfit from the beginning of the movie to the very end.  As if being a cheerleader is not bad enough they have to throw it in our face.  The kill scenes were not as bloody as I expected but the robot is a hoot.  I leave it up to you but I am donating it to Goodwill.",1331942400,,1016,4.055276381909548
4858206,1,B005QBST4C,Do not believe the early reviews of this movie. They were written by people associated with this trash. I LOVE horror movies. This IS NOT a horror movie. It is just a DVD with some bad footage filmed with a very poor video camera. The gore is cheap. The violence is cheap. Everything about this movie is cheap and bad. It's not even funny-bad. These people made this DVD to steal your money. There is NO talent here! I'm writing this review so that you save your money. Do not be fooled by the cool cover art (which is the only thing decent about this DVD). This is just a lazy movie with nothing to offer horror and slasher fans.

8483138,5,B005QBST4C,"This is a ""so bad it is good film"" by design.  It is made to look like a 1980's throwback with all the bells and whistles.

A group of kids go camping in the woods and there is a slasher. Details of the slasher are reviewed during the opening credits and the cliche camp fire tale. Mike (Charles Sullivan) leads the group along with his exchange student friend Ian (Brandon Raker) the token Brit. Mike brings along his girlfriend Deb (Ruby Larocca). Their relationship is on the outs as he also brings along his latest girlfriend Courtney (Sierra Ferrell) who wears a cheerleaders outfit to go camping because it is a spoof of the 80's genre. Also in the group is Richie (Chris Woodall) Deb's nerdy brother who brings along his robot who is far too human and reveals far too much about Richie. There is also Rachel (Erin Russ) a girl Richie is crazy about.

The film include things we remember from 80's films. It has product placement, the weird country store scene, and local band soundtrack. The film had a bad sound system as there appears to be a background noise of a generator for all the night time shots. The robot had a Cadillac emblem glued to its chest which was missing in a few scenes, but the glue marks were still there.  They go to Camp ""Wood"" so they can party and have sex.

The film had funny and clever dialogue representing the 80's era. I spent much of the film laughing, especially during the country store scene where writer/director Eamon Hardiman plays a country geek in a ""Choose Life"" T-shirt.  Extras: Director's commentary/ Behind the scenes/ Ian speaks.
