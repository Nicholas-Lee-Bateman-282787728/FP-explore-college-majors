On their show ""Best of the Worst"", they watch and frequently make fun of movies in the ""so bad it's good"" territory. Most people will be familiar with this sort of film from 80s action movies starring Schwarzenegger, where the plot and acting isn't so great but there's enough action and dumb one-liners to keep you watching. All the positive reviews are from people looking at Partners in that sort of way.

What makes Partners a so-bad-it's-good movie? It really will help if you know something about filmmaking when you watch this movie, because there's so much the director does wrong. There's some obvious things, like the volume level keeps going up and down. But student films are like that, and you don't criticize them because they're just kids. What makes this movie stand out, is that the guy who made it was a film teacher by day, so he has no excuse to be this bad. His later films are also apparently way better, so this is a sort of rookie effort and therefore with critique.

What's so bad? Let's take an example. There's a now-famous scene where two character are standing in a room. A woman is standing to our left, and a man is sitting down to our right. The camera cuts back to the woman during the conversation, and then the man walks into frame from FROM THE LEFT. To do that, he would have had to run back around the camera behind us, otherwise we would have seen him cross in front of the camera. Absolutely no competent director or editor would let such a thing slide. The moment you put together what just happened, your jaw drops to the floor. And there's more.

Here's something I put together. The main villain in this movie is doing his best impression of Heath Ledger's Joker. The movie release dates line up, and the guy even licks his lips trying to imitate the Joker. But this is never called out in the movie, there's no makeup, I don't even know if the director realized it because this is never really played up. Bit it's definitely there. It's the little details you discover like this, that make Partners worth watching.

Can you spot the time the script supervisor was caught on camera and quickly tried to duck out of view? Can you spot the fake blueprint two characters both stand in front of in their closeups- even though they're supposed to be standing in separate spots? Marvel at the neighbors watching the film crew do their thing, and for some reason the director didn't move the camera, so it's like random bystanders are just watching our characters talk for no reason.

There's just so much, and that's why Parters is a gem. Minus one star because it really is close to a student film, so I spent half of my first viewing wondering if the film was professional enough to bother making fun of. It is, barely.",1522886400,7,2885,4.561776061776062
