1844499,4,B00008G8P4,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I have to state up front that DER SAMURAI is one of the strangest films Ive seen in a while.  It is wildly entertaining and has some great gorebut it also defies classification.  Part horror, part fantasy, and part surrealistic fever-dream, this is one movie you won't forget after you watch it.

Now, don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed the film, and I plan on revisiting it sometime soon.  But if you're looking for a movie with explanations as to whats going on or why, do not expect anything like that from this one.  But if you're searching for hardcore bizarreness with a lot of lopped-off heads and craziness, then youve come to the right place.

DER SAMURAI is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears fairly high, and the result is a great-looking film that appeals to the eyes.

The acting is very good, with Michael Diercks in the lead role as Jakob, and Pit Bukowski playing Der Samurai.  Both do a superb job with their portrayals, although I think Bukowski deserves special recognition for his role.  Pulling off a cross-dressing psycho is probably not an easy task, but he certainly makes the character an icy individual I would hate to meet in a dark alley.

The special effects in DER SAMURAI are excellent, and theres plenty of carnage to go around.  Der Samurai takes pride in lopping off his victims heads and then displaying them on sticks with psychotic abandon.  This nonsensical violence is part of what makes the film so much fun.

The other aspect is the storyline.  Not much is explained, but it doesnt really have to be.  We have a simple cat-and-mouse thriller that keeps the audience enthralled.  Its pretty cut and dry.  A discussion about who Der Samurai is and why he does what he does would have been nice, but the lack of it doesnt really detract from the film overall.

DER SAMURAI is a big win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for something different.  Im pretty sure the film won't appeal to everyone, as it has a bit of an artistic flair, but its entertaining and weird, a violent trip into insanity.  If you can stomach it, give it a look.",1434931200,3,2190,4.547314578005115
1844500,3,B00008G8P4,"Before I start, I just want you all to know that if you decide to stream this movie (Which is listed as Unrated) a long sequence at the end of the movie, which is pivotal, and I mean PIVOTAL, has been unduly censored by Amazon with a giant black box to cover some male nudity. I will further say that it is the type of male nudity which never makes it into studio released movies! You won't be shocked, because you can't see it. Which as adults, choosing to stream an UNCUT, foreign, art movie seems like a boneheaded move on Amazon's part. The studio released the movie unrated precisely so they would not have to make cuts in content.  So I actually would recommend you get this movie thru a Netflix rental. It really is necessary to have this scene AS IS for the climax to work. 'Nuff said.

I found this movie to be thematically murky. As a gay man myself, I admit the story of a seductive, cross dressing, forest dwelling entity that kills with a samurai sword was intriguing for me, but perhaps the film was too symbolic and untethered. By the climax, I could not really discern what ""Der Samurai"" was supposed to represent to the protagonist. All signals point to the main character being a closet case as well as just surpressed in general - in his job, by the burden of family, by being stuck in a small town, in his feelings of masculine inadueqacy. But it almost seems trite for a movie in 2015. When I considered the climax, I actually thought of Kevin Angers, ""Fireworks,""  Which is a short film about a character's burgeoning homosexuality that ends in an energetic celebration with, you guessed it, FIREWORKS, and a bedazzled christmas tree. That's from waaaay back in 1946!  This wolf sprite/shape shifter/drag devil might represent the ultimate in gender freedom, sexuality, wanderlust and sinful temptation (including murder), it's just that to the average viewer these things might not seem readily apparant. The movie is also a little slow. Always be skeptical of movie marketing, because this, despite murder, decapitations and gore - REALLY ISN'T A HORROR MOVIE. It is definitely a well-heeled curiosity for thinking viewers. Everyone else might be WTF.

Some pros of this movie is it's unique take on freedom, some well crafted interactions between the two main characters and it's cinematography.
Some cons are it's slightly lacking pace and frustrations of narrative answers while watching. Also it really is just a two actor movie. There is very little relevant interaction between any other characters. And one last thing. It was actually a BIG deal to me. There is a blaring pop song at the end of the movie during the climax, and all I could think of was how ridiculous and dated this movie will seem 5 years from now simply from the inclusion of this ridiculous europop song. It might have been in everyone's best interests if a triumphant instrumental cue had been chosen instead.",1434585600,21,2911,4.733727810650888

1844502,2,B00008G8P4,"Just not enough going on in this film - when there finally is some action happening, it's not at all scary.  this is a slow psychological thriller (without thrills), not a horror movie at all.",1434412800,,192,4.485714285714286
1844503,3,B00008G8P4,The movie is extraordinary but the streaming version is censored.

1844504,5,B00008G8P4,"I saw the film in September 2014 in Vienna while it was on the festival circuit. The director Till Kleinert was attending the Screening and I had the chance of talking to him. Everybody who had the chance of meeting him knows that he really is a sweet and down to earth guy. So it was really a surprise to see the movie. The thing is dark and violent and is spreadingf a feel of despair and loneliness (at least for me). Maybe that was thanks to the great actors who played the lead roles (Michel Diercks and Pit Bukowski). Espacially Bukowski`s performance made me think of another great german actor Klaus Kinski. He played the villain with such a coolness and animalistic undertow that every second he was on screen was really creepy. The story itself might not be new, but it is told in style and with so much love that it's very easy to oversee that tiny flaw. So it's nice to see some high quality genre film coming from Germany and it leaves you wanting more. So hopefully Mr. Kleinert will be back for more bloodshed and movie making.",1428624000,7,1042,4.404145077720207
1844505,4,B00008G8P4,"Movie contains nudity and NOT for underage children!!!

This 1987 anime short by Kazuo Yamazaki is quite entertaining.  Chimatsuri is a 16-year-old samurai who, when the twin Toki sisters transfer to their school, becomes the focus of the twins' vengeful desire for the return of their late grandfather's tantou (dagger).  This dagger was won in a duel between their father and Chimatsuri's over a decade previously.  The twins' grandmother has been grooming them to get the dagger back for a long time.

The animated short (around 45 minutes) has that 80s anime look.  The story is pretty good, even though there are many holes in the narrative. What is going on with the robbery in the begining? Why was there a duel? What happened to Chimatsuri's father?  Why the phobias (you'll have to see the movie to understand)?  These holes, and others, are reasons why a star is docked from my review.  Is there a manga series where this has originated?  I do not know.

The movie can be watched in English dubbed and/or subtitled.  There is ample (anime) nudity which is part of the plot.

4 of 5.  Holes in the narrative that are never answered.  Voices and animation very good.  A full hour presentation with answers would have made the movie perfect.",1420329600,,1248,4.761682242990654
1844506,4,B00008G8P4,"The Samurai is a quick, funny, and entertaining one episode OAV. Right from the get-go one can see the 80's styling that remain as a mark from the time when the Samurai was created.  The art style is definetly close to Ranma 1/2, though as an OAV the animation is considerably better.  I found the characters to be for the most part very likable, and I got a few good laughs out of all of them. The action is ok, and though theres little plot this isn't really the sort of thing that needs one. Theres also a fair bit of nudity packed into the short running time, so beware if you dislike that or rejoyce if thats just your sort of thing.
  With its 45 minute running time some may not be inclined to hand over the $25 dollors it costs, and I myself think that there are definetly better anime you could be buying with your money.  However, I still recomend this to those looking for good and funny, though short, ride.",1080172800,4,919,4.258620689655173

1844600,5,B00008G8P4,"This is a weird yet very good horror/thriller film. First let me say this movie is about a crossdressing guy who slices & decapitates people with a samurai sword, hence the name. The gore effects are well done & the soundtrack is very good also & I normally don't like movie soundtracks except Halloween. The actors did a very good job but I feel especially the actor who played the Samurai, Pit Bukowski did a wonderful job. This is one the very rare horror films that just seems to grab your attention right from the beginning & really hold it all the way through. The shots & cinematography were very good also for a low budget horror film. Not much in the way of extras, a trailer for the film, 3 trailers for other artsploitation film & a somewhat short but also good to watch making of. All in all, if you are a fan of horror & want to see something a bit different you really cant go wrong with this film, I really loved it. Also, for those that are worried about this being a BD-R release, if you contact Artsploitation by email they well send you an address that you can send your BD-R copy to & they will mail you a pressed disc version.",1443052800,,1147,4.26605504587156

1844602,4,B00008G8P4,"REALLY dug the movie due to its macabre fairy tale aesthetic and completely unconventional story.

There are blatant themes about homosexuality and coming to terms with one's self, but it's all expressed in a beautiful surreality that blends abrupt violence with dreamlike colors and an utterly fantastic soundtrack.

The ending was spectacularly strange as well and packs a visual wallop of a metaphor (and I'm not even talking about the censored thing).

But yeah, Amazon should be ashamed of censoring a product that people are either buying/renting via stream. I'm sorry, but seeing (SPOILER) a penis does not constitute a black censor bar bobbing about the final, impactful scenes. It served the purpose of the story and the fact that they went out of their way to censor it is just ridiculous considering ALL of the movies on here with far worse content that isn't censored.",1442016000,,880,5.013698630136986
1844603,1,B00008G8P4,"I love love subtitled and foreign films. So I search them out. It's hard to find a good German movie. Most are Scandinavian written, produced, and acted. I got excited about this. What a let down. It was a horribly shot movie. All of Germany to film and I felt like I saw only trash cans, close ups, and small rooms. What a waste! Then the acting.... my gawd was it bad. Only  a handful of actors and I could care less about any of them. No depth AT ALL. The main character was a slow talking non-blinking half dead mumbling idiot from scene 1. Needless to say, I was bored to tears. So why 2 stars?  - I'm taking German and I wanted to hear it. That's it... no other reason. The issue with a black box covering the male characters genitalia. Who cares because like most of the film.... it had no purpose. None. Just something to keep the audience glued until the excruciating end. Yes, the end couldn't come soon enough for this flop. The weird scenes and dialogue were just that...WEIRD. If I wanted to take a class on psychology, I'd sign up for a real one Carl Jung 101. I don't need the poorer than poor man's version with a sword.

1844605,5,B00008G8P4,"A great film! I had read reviews about this film on a few Horror websites and truly, while it does fall into that genre, it's not what people might expect. There's so many layers to this film that I would recommend watching at least twice. Know that if you watch the DIGITAL version however, it is edited in several scenes that does change the viewer's experience. Invest in a hard copy of either DVD or Blue Ray and enjoy the extras that come along with it.
Even though this is a thesis project of the director, this film speaks highly of the writer/director's skill in crafting this small pocket of a universe created in what could easily be a small town in any country that has access to wilderness nearby.

To go from here and tell you what this was about or why it was about is very difficult. I was never a fan of David Lynch and this odd movie was really odd. I get that it is a shape shifter and a cross dresser but its purpose was never really explained, did he have a crush on the young cop? I'm using the term it because I believe it is a werewolf, I think. Was he just on a killing spree? I don't know and if it was said I didn't get it. This is a German movie about a werewolf, cross dressing samurai? I am very confused. I was at sometimes intrigued but still confused. I don't know who to recommend this to or if I should.
