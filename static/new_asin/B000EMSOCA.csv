8111484,5,B000EMSOCA,"This is a great reference DVD for both country western line dancing and any swing dance that uses jazz steps (which means all of them)!  It teaches you 70 basic jazz steps - really clear and easy to follow instructions, as well as several fun and simple beginner line dances.  This is a real gem, so don't pass it up just because it's a VHS tape!",1330732800,,346,4.2272727272727275
