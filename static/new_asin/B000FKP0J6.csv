Very interesting and compelling story of flaws discovered in the most popular passenger plane ever built - the Boeing 737. Here's a great documentary about a plane crash from 1978&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Dwight-And-Nile-The-Crash-Of-PSA-Flight-182/dp/B0044T27SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Dwight And Nile: The Crash Of PSA Flight 182</a>",1335139200,,468,7.666666666666667
8124028,5,B000FKP0J6,"This is an A & E DVD with the high quality one would expect from A & E.  Bill Kurtis is an excellent narrator, clear and compelling.  My only real criticism, if one can call it that, is that the DVD is only 44 minutes long, and was quite expensive when I bought it.  On the other hand, the DVD includes overviews of two crashes US Air 427 and 585, and gives animations showing what happened, and shows parts from a 737.  Extensive interviews are done with many different people, including FAA, engineers, technical people, scientists, pilots, lawyers.  Theories regarding the rudder valve are discussed and are accompanied by video of the actual part and clear explanations.  This is a worthwhile video to watch, wish it were longer and lower in price.  I applaud A & E for looking into these disasters, and for helping to make the investigation thorough so that those that lost their lives did not do so in vain.  My sympathy and empathy is extended to the families/relatives of the victims.  This DVD makes you think, and I found myself wondering if I actually want to fly on a 737, as they have never found the actual causative factor for the failures.",1316649600,,1155,4.567961165048544
