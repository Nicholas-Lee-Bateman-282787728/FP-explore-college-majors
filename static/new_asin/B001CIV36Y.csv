8287921,3,B001CIV36Y,"Just a thought ladies and gents...it is more feasible for you to spend the additional $10 (on top of the listed price for this DVD) on the 'Sonic The Hedgehog' complete series DVD set.  My youngest boy (a true Sonic fan) saw this at a local supermarket and asked me for it.  Considering that it's his birthday on Feb. 10th and I knew I was gonna get the DVD box set (through Amazon.com) that has the same episodes, I said ""that's a negatory, good buddy!""  If your son or daughter (or you) likes Sonic, just spend the extra duckets for the entire series, not just for 4 episodes.  As I said in the beginning of this 'review,' it's just a thought.",1297036800,4,645,4.305785123966942
