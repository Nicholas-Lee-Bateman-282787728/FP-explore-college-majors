7875118,3,6304647883,"""The Mark of Dracula"" is a direct-to-video movie that actually has a decent idea behind it but is handicapped by both a lack of imagination and its low budget, which explains why the titles use footage from the silent classic ""Nosferatu"" (public domain).  This is not a bad beginning, which adds a touch of class, but if you think this 1997 film is set back in the good old days in Transylvania, then you are mistaken because that is not the set up here.  Instead writer-director Ron Ford is going back to Stoker's original ""Dracula"" and the character of Lucy Westenra, the best friend of Mina Murray.  In the novel Lucy is turned by Dracula into one of the undead and is executed by Van Helsing and the rest of the gang.  In Ford's version, Lucy (Roxanne Coyle) survived the encounter and we are now picking up the story a century later.
Lucy has been spending the time relieving her victims of both their blood and their possessions, amassing a nice little fortune that she intends to use to bring Dracula back to life.  Now Lucy has arrived at the Carreras-Hinds research facility where they do work on cloning from DNA.  This is important because Lucy has been carting around the wooden stake used to dust Dracula and the blood on it is still (gasp) wet after all these years.  In other words, what if the scientists of ""Jurassic Park"" brought Dracula back to life instead of dinosaurs?  Well, the short answer is that you would have this sad little film in which the scientists manage to bring Dracula (Mark Vasconcellos) back to life, so to speak.  ""Mark of Dracula"" saves a lot of time because Dracula comes back not as a baby vampire, but full grown and ready to start putting the bite on people.
I could wax eloquenty and pontificate on how absurd the cloning idea is in this film (e.g., Dracula's clone has a navel), but all you really need to know is that this is a long way to go to bring Dracula back from the dead.  In theory we should not have been surprised if Dracula came back human, which would be a very, very interesting idea, although admittedly it is one that Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan played win in Marvel Comic's ""Tomb of Dracula"" and that Darla went through on season two of ""Angel.""  But Ford basically sets up this big cloning Dracula idea and then does essentially nothing with it.  The bigger question is why just pulling the stake from Dracula's chest was not enought to bring him back, or why Lucy would carry the stake around for a century on the off chance that science would progress to the point of being able to clone vampires...
Then there is the way that Dracula rewards Lucy for her long and faithful service, which is just one more nail in the coffin of this bad horror film.  Because ""Mark of Dracula"" wastes a potentially good idea for a Dracula movie I ended up rounding up on its 2.5 rating.  However, I realize that recommending a movie because while you watch it you can spend your time thinking up your own better version of the film is not normally a good idea.",1067472000,,3012,4.4726277372262775
7875119,3,6304647883,"First of all, we have to realize that Bram Stoker played a little loose with the truth, and Lucy Westenra survived her little run-in with Van Helsing.  She's still around, and somehow managed to get ahold of the stake  used to kill Dracula(yeah, I know it was supposed to be a Bowie knife -  that darn Stoker!).  She takes the stake to the resident mad scientist, who  uses the genetic material still on it to clone the Count!  Adapting rapidly  to modern times, the Count also wishes the doc to use genetic engineering  to eliminate this problem he has with sunlight...  There's a couple of good  ideas in here, sadly the filmmakers didn't have enough money to capitalize  on them and wind up falling into typical low-budget hi-jinks and cliches;  still pretty inventive for a zero budget flick.",964051200,3,796,4.688405797101449
