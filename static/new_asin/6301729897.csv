353859,5,6301729897,Excellent product. I had lost 52 pounds on the Sweatin to the Oldies program. The only this is they are great aerobics program; you might have to include sit ups or push ups with the program. Even though I lost alot of weight I wasn't very tight and tone. However Richard Simmons always delivers with a fun and effective weight loss program.,1194393600,,341,4.516129032258065

But, I am able to do this. Just not any knee bends. Richard makes it fun with the great oldies songs and I really like the people in it. They are REAL people, not the Hollywood actresses and actors who look like skinny models. They are real people like me and are obviosly having a good time. This video is great for people just starting out or, like me, who have physical limitations.",1185753600,,552,4.073394495412844

He doesn't give much instruction, but after you do it a few times you can practically do it with your eyes closed. If I feel like I'm not getting enough from it, i do things a little faster, and at times do the tape twice. And after that I take my son for a walk and do some sit ups. Just waiting for the next video to come in the mail. So far I have lost 12 pounds and it has only been 2 weeks.

It has a stage and a band and at the end of each song, Richard prances up to the stage like a teenager to applaud the mediocre band.

choreographed and without Richard's usual directions  on the exercises, it would be very difficult for one to follow up, especially someone too obese to be as agile as this dance video displays.",1178496000,,353,4.4

This was the first Richard Simmons video I tried (in an aerobics class for college last semester), and I'm ADDICTED!! I used to laugh at Richard Simmons, but after I did the video it's like ... how can you NOT love him?!

353939,4,6301729897,"I'm significantly overweight, and I've never tried an exercise tape before this one. And now I'm sold on it!

As a number of reviewers have complained, Richard Simmons' exercise routine lacks much instruction, and on my initial effort I found this terribly frustrating. But after only a few tries, I've discovered that even a profound klutz like me can start picking up the flow, and now I follow with little difficulty. The intensity of the work-out is very much determined by your own energy level; when I began with this tape, it didn't take much awkward stumbling about to generate a sweat and elevate my heart rate. As my conditioning has improved, I find that by putting extra energy into the moves (particularly the arm movements), the exercise can become much more rigorous. No small part of my enthusiasm for this tape stems from the wondrous array of body types ""sweatin'"" along with Richard. It is a great motivator to see very overweight individuals plunge into the exercise routine with big smiles on their faces. And don't miss the final segment after the cool-down: the participants are identified and their weight loss accomplishments told. There are some amazing and encouraging stories told there! This is an exercise tape that I highly recommend for those of us who are significantly overweight and trying to improve our fitness.",1171324800,,1348,4.964601769911504

353941,4,6301729897,I had this tape years ago and my daughter took it.  Its just as good as I remember.  Thanks for such good service,1168819200,,113,3.869565217391304
353942,5,6301729897,"First of all I would just like to say that I love Richard Simmons and his tapes have made me happier than any other workout tape I have ever used. I am 16 years old, and when I was little, about 3 or 4, my mom bought Richard Simmons: Sweatin' to the Oldies, her and her friends would excercise to it and bring their daughters along and we would dance and just have a good time to the music. Now, they haven't done that in years, well, probobly about 12 years actually, and I, being the naive teenager I was, would make fun of my mom for having done Richard Simmons because it seemed so lame. But then a couple years ago, in secret, because I would have been devistated to like, have my older brother and his friends come down and see me doing Richard Simmons, I put in Richard Simmons and excerised with him. And I actually really liked it! I loved the cheesy dance moves and watching the people on the tape sing along to the music! It makes you feel so good about yourself and (suprisingly) did not make me feel like a loser! It made me feel good. Now if I ever am feeling like I have been lazy all day but it's too rainy or cold to go outside running and I'm too lazy (or it's too late) to go to the gym, I pop in Richard Simmons. It still makes me feel good. At the end of the workout when  you cool down he tells you to ""Give yourself a hug"" and it makes me smile, everytime.",1138060800,,1379,4.032846715328467

353944,2,6301729897,"This is not a good tape for younger people or those who have some background exercising and being fit. You just don't get a work out if you are. However, if you're bigger and do have a full range of motion then this is a good starting point.",1120780800,,241,4.041666666666667
353945,5,6301729897,"I am amazed that some reviews and some of my friends complain, whine, they can't follow, boo hoo.  I go one way he goes another. After playing the tapes a  few times you pick it up. Just go with the flow. Have fun!  I lost 30 lbs already. Am 70 yrs old and was able to get off my high blood pressure pills. People crack me up.  You don't have to do every step. Laugh, have fun. I am indebted to Richard Simmons.  I always hated to exercise and I get up 6:00 every morning and play at least 2 tapes!  Thank you Richard.

That was amazing! And it was motivational..as if Richard isn't motivational enough in his own right.

These tapes appeal to me since I always have enjoyed dancing and wished I was better at it. Well, when I dance alone I can PRETEND I'm the best dancer eve.  ;) Good music and cheerful banter helped motivate me. As I lost weight and need to kick up the routine I added weights, speeded it up, picked up videos to alternate with......It's been 2 years now and I still enjoy a week or two of Richard's videos when teh weather is rainy or when I just feel like giving my mood a push up.

I agree with others  who note his instruction is not always clear and specific; the first time I  used the tape that was a bit disconcerting. Then I realized that one of my  exercise goals was to relieve stress and this was not something to stress  about.  Richard and the people who join him are clearly having so much fun  -- it's contagious.  The great thing is you get to do this workout in the  privacy of your home and it doesn't matter if you master every move.
I  like that the participants who join Richard in this, and all of his videos,  really represent humanity.  They are different sizes, shapes, and ethnic  backgrounds.  Some are clearly more coordinated than others BUT all are  enjoying themselves.  I particularly find the closing of each tape  motivational, when participants come forward doing their own steps and  their names and the # of pounds they have lost is displayed.
This is  the easiest of Richard's tapes and a good place to begin if you haven't  previously done much exercise.",969235200,,1063,4.612903225806452
354098,2,6301729897,I found this tape very difficult to follow. Simmons gives little or no instruction and no warning about what's coming up next. Poor photographic  direction makes it difficult to see how the exercises are performed.,967420800,,214,5.114285714285714
354099,3,6301729897,"Richard's tapes are a lot of fun to do once you learn them, and this is no  exception. However, I prefer a longer routine. (This is only 21 or so  minutes aerobic.) And Richard doesn't do mirror cueing on this tape. But  it's a good place to start for Beginners. Beginners be aware that there are  a lot of knee lifts that will wear you out the first few times you do this  routine. The up side to this is that you will build strength and stamina  quickly and be able to move on to his other aerobic tapes that are longer  and just as much fun (if not moreso). I'd say this tape would be too easy  for Intermediate or higher exercisers.",965001600,,636,4.1138211382113825

7814863,5,6301729897,"This is one of my favorite Richard Simmons' tapes.  It runs about 45 minutes, the songs are roughly the same length as performed by the original artist (in other Oldies' tapes the songs can be much longer), and the steps are easy to learn.  Who knew how much fun it would be to do the Pony in my sixties?",1509753600,,304,4.135593220338983
