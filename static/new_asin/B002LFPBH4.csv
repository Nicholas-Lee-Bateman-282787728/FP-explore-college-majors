8372959,4,B002LFPBH4,"A throwback to any earlier time, this dark revenge flick is filled with weird characters, dark surroundings, and murky happenings.  This is true edge of your seat Grindhouse film making.  Sometimes artful, often brutal and surprising, and impossible not to watch.",1307577600,,263,5.390243902439025
8372960,1,B002LFPBH4,"This ""movie"" has nothing going for it.  No acting, no plot, cheap effects, and extremely bad video quality.  Maybe that was on purpose, but it was so poor, it was barely watchable.  This is a huge waste of time, and am really surprised no one stepped forward to warn us all about this mega-dud!!",1268611200,,295,4.425925925925926
