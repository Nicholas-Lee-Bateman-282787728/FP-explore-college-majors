It duplicates some episodes from other collections (which have deeper moral lessons, my preference if we're having tv/electronic time). It's a nice collection and long running time (good to keep at grandparents'), especially for a few bucks, just not solely Brother Bear's adventures. Hope that helps you!",1428019200,25,717,4.821138211382114
