7894423,3,6305738238,"Metal Blade Record's Metalmeister DVD is a treat for fans of their artists.
Basically I got it because I have been a fan of Lizzy Borden for a long time and have yet to see him preform at all (a video, or live, anything) and this DVD has him performing one of his great songs and an interview about his Album 'Master Of Disguise'. Hopefully they will release an entire Lizzy DVD one of these days.
The other artists on this DVD are pretty cool too. A couple of Gwar classic videos are some of my favorites on this compilation.
Basically a showcase compilation of videos and live performances of various degrees of quality, get this if you are a fan of any of the Metal Blade Records' artists.
The videos and such are basically old though. I mean, Lizzy was talking about Master Of Disguise as a new release! The Armoured Saint live song is of pretty poor quality, but beggars can't be choosers.
The only major complaint I have is that the text selections are very difficult to read, small, & blurry. Hopefully they'll fix that up in future releases.",957398400,2,1049,4.46875
