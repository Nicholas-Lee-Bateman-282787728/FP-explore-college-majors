8216926,4,B000V72AZK,"The Bible came to life in a new way for me when I saw and heard the productions by Visual Bible: the ""Gospel of John"" and the ""Book of Acts""!  I could picture myself there on the shore amongst the crowd at the feeding of the 5,000, and being in the courtyard when Peter betrayed Jesus, then again being drawn into the scene of the Apostles' arrest and the Jews' plot to kill Paul!  I love Dean Jones' narration through out the movie which drew me right into the excitement and the emotions they must have felt in their cultural and historical setting!  It is a must see!!",1470700800,,571,4.268518518518518

8216928,5,B000V72AZK,"I have the Matthew set on VHS and the John set as a 3-disc DVD. One of the shortcomings of the VHS set was the lack of closed captioning, which I think was added for the DVD. Specific comments on each set:

Matthew:

An excellent performance by Bruce Marchiano as Jesus, and a believable supporting cast. I heard that Bruce Marchiano had been an actor on American soap operas before making this film, but he was unknown to me before Matthew. Richard Kiley was good in the role of Matthew, who served as the narrator for many scenes. Bruce Marchiano wrote a book about his experiences making this film and after the film was released. I have not read the book, but found the film to be very inspiring. The ACTS series (not included in this set) was not as good as Matthew. Using more well-known actors detracted from the message, especially since some of them were well-known Hollywood liberals who may not have believed in the words they spoke.

John:

Excellent narration by Christopher Plummer. Henry Ian Cusick was good as Jesus, and gave a good performance. Later on, I was put off when I saw him in the American TV show ""Lost"", looking much like he did when he played the role of Jesus. The film itself has a compelling and realistic look to it.

That said, I need to admit my bias against actors in these kind of films. The more famous the actor, the more it detracts from the ""reality"" of the film. Performances can be inspired, yet they can never measure up to the real people who were in the actual historical events, especially Jesus.

Whether you believe these films portray the truth or not, they are both well-made and are faithful to the text. They are also good for people who learn visually or by listening rather than learning by reading.",1188518400,4,1755,4.520504731861199
