8188062,1,B000P0NC4G,"I bought the 4 DVD set which includes this DVD along with the Belly Dance, Latin and Jazz dance DVDs.  NONE of these ""instructors"" look/act/dance/move like instructors.  None have any rhythm, and their back-up ""dancers"" can't dance worth a flip.  In the belly dance one you don't even shimmy.  How can you teach belly dance and not teach the shimmy?  This hip-hop DVD, like all the other 3 in my set, are a JOKE!

DON""T BUY THIS.  You will regret it like I did.

p.s.  I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it NONE!",1319760000,,535,4.3232323232323235
8188063,4,B000P0NC4G,"This is from a bunch of dvds from Denise Druce who has a gym club called ""She & co."" The dvd has intro to Denise (owner), the workout & about the club.
This like all the other dvds are low budget, 1 maybe 2 angles & rarely zooms in if ever, but decent sound & if good content & instructor, it can be ignored.
Missy Jones has a great personality, she keeps you from getting bored. On the other DVD ""Non-Stop Hip Hop"" (which is has moves that won't make you even feel a heart rate) She says she has 12 years of dance experience & loves it & it does show. Her backup dancers can't dance, though they are better then the dancers in Missy's other dvd.
This 35 min workout starts with a 8 min warm-up consisting of easy dance moves & head roll that is the start of the routine. The layout is the usual, learn one move, repeat 4x, learn another, redo both, do another move, redo all 3... The 8 min cool cool down has better stretching of the shoulders, torso, hips & legs & has plie.
I did get my heart rate up & felt like I got good cardio & learned some new moves as well as learning to move my body to the beat better.
The pros are hip, easy enough to follow dance moves, fun/lively instructor, good pace, decent beat ""music"" that did work for me to keep me going as well.
The cons are Missy never goes in 1/2 speed when learning, she doesn't have to go snail's pace, but half speed would help since she only gives minimal cues & counts like most dance aerobic videos. Even with that w/the repetition which I needed she gave a good amount w/o being too much & I was able to get the moves well enough even the first time. The production values are also low, but deal able & the background dancers are annoying, but are good if helps Missy stay her lively self.

I finally found their site at fitessentials net which has previews of a 5 of their 19 dvds.",1197763200,5,1848,4.119113573407202
