5102388,5,B007P3Q95K,"Richard II - 5 STARS.
Perfect acting, incredible story, gorgeous costumes, beautiful cinematography. By far the best of the four, and mostly because of an electrifying performance by Ben Whishaw (Cloud Atlas, Skyfall).
I asked myself why I hadn't seen Whishaw more often!
His performance as Richard II is towering, electrifying, chameleon-like, moving, disturbing, delicate, multi-faceted, and most of all, brilliant.
A phenomenal performance, and worthy of much praise indeed.

The supporting cast more than holds it's own:
Patrick Stewart (always great, but sadly he leaves the narrative rather early), Clemence Posy (a great, underrated French actress), David Suchet (reliable as ever), and Rory Kinnear (Who's Bolingbroke ""bursts with valour and courage"").

But let us give credit to where credit is due. Shakespeare...was one damn fine writer!

BEST SPEECH (delivered gloriously by Ben Whishaw):
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court...

...

Henry IV Part 1 - 4 STARS.
Jeremy Irons is one of the finest Shakespearean actors to ever live. His Henry IV is a sharp contrast to Whishaw's Richard. Richard is pious, noble, weak-hearted, and entirely eligible to be king. Henry is strong, prepared, diligent, hard, and a usurper.
And there you see the problem. Richard was the rightful king, yet he was not a good ruler. Henry was a traitor, banished by Richard, yet it was he should sit on the throne of England.
It was not until Henry's son - Prince Hal, would sit on the throne of England as Henry V, that England would have a ruler that was both ready and legitimate.

And as Prof. Peter Saccio (a renowned Shakespearean scholar) points out, overthrowing a king (as in what Henry IV did to Richard II) proves to others that a king can be overthrown.
So it is with great certainty that Irons's Henry proclaims:
""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.""
...
Henry IV, Part 1 has a great cast, led by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons.
In the supporting cast we see: Tom Hiddleston (Mentored by Kenneth Branagh, Tom is an excellent actor, as adept at playing Loki as playing Prince Hal), Simon Russell Beale (a most excellent Falstaff - perfectly capturing Sir John's mix of charisma and loathsomeness), Julie Walters, and Joe Armstrong (a fine, impulsive Hotspur).
On the whole, the cast is as well chosen, experienced, and star-studded as you could expect from a BBC Two Production produced by Sam Mendes (Skyfall).
...
So far so good, Henry IV, Part 1 has a stellar cast, luscious costumes, a battle scene or two, a heroic speech here and there...What's not to like?
I'll tell you - the lack of Jeremy Irons.
Yes, the Oscar winning actor has a very small screen time - the majority of the play given to raunchy tavern scenes, and political intrigue in Scotland. I saw disappointingly little of Irons in this adaptation, but on the whole, I loved it!

...

Henry IV Part 2 - 3 STARS.
Ian McEwan (Game of Thrones) co-stars in this one. Sadly, I didn't find this one at all as interesting as the previous wins.

...

Henry V - 5 STARS.
In my opinion, Henry V is the greatest play in the Henriad, and one of Shakespeare's greatest ever history plays (other greats would include Richard II, III, and Julius Caesar). There is quite simply, something for everybody here. Whether you love action, romance, political intrigue, drama, or historical fiction, you will love Henry V.

Perhaps one of the greatest things about Henry V is that it gives the title actor room to shine. And there have been many great portrayals of the warrior king, over the years. In film, there have been only 3:

1. Laurence Olivier, who starred and directed in a very famous 1944 adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-V-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780021320/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry V (The Criterion Collection)</a>. This film was released during WWII, and depicts the English as strong, valiant, heroic soldiers, and the French as pompous, foolish, and decadent.
Everything about this film was meant to boost morale during the darkest time during English history.
In short, it was thinly veiled British propaganda. And by Jove did it work. It was a serious morale booster.

2. Kenneth Branagh, who starred and directed in an acclaimed 1989&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-V/dp/079284615X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry V</a>. The great Branagh's first film, Henry V co-featured a star-studded, immensely talented supporting cast. This striking, brilliant adaptation stripped away all the glamour and heroic-ness of Olivier's adaptation, and the end result was exciting, brilliantly acted, gritty, imaginative, and action packed.
Still the best.

3. Tom Hiddleston, who stars in a 2012 adaptation directed by Thea Sharrock, released by BBC. Hiddleston was younger than Olivier when he played Henry, but a year older than Branagh. The actor (fresh from playing the foolish, care-free Prince Hal) is surrounded by older players, so the end result is a Henry quite young, fresh from the death of his father, and forced to play a large role in the affairs of state.

But it's nothing less then compelling. I have always wondered how Henry the Fifth made the transition from Hal the playboy, the rascal, to Henry V, the warrior, the man. Tom Hiddleston manages the transition perfectly. His Henry is one charismatic, grave, and cerebral.
An excellent, fresh take on a classic play.
...
The film itself is well shot, and the action scenes are good. The supporting cast lacks the star factor, but none of the talent, of the previous films - with Julie Walters returning as Mistress Quickly, and John Hurt as Chorus.

However, Henry V suffers from a lack of visual grandeur. In Branagh's film, the King delivers the disturbing Harfleur speech from a rearing stallion, surrounded by fire and the carnage of battle. In The Hollow Crown, Hiddleston delivers the speech with equal gusto, but this time it is on a bridge, on the back of a complacent mount, with the fat mayor of Harfleur standing a few yards from him.
And what of the most famous speech in the play - perhaps of ANY Shakespeare play save Hamlet - the ""St. Crispin's Day"" Speech? Kenneth Branagh delivers it on the top of supply wagons, surrounded by a hundred soldiers, to a rousing Patrick Doyle score. When the Irish actor says, ""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,"" you feel like you are part of that small, noble band, led by that young, heroic king.
Tom Hiddleston speaks the immortal lines to just five men, standing on the ground, to no music at all. As I said before, the way he speaks those lines is worthy of praise, but the direction is not.

I could go on, but there is a huge difference from what you can do on a $9 million dollar budget, then on a $900,000 dollar budget. On the whole, I loved The Hollow Crown: Henry V, and greatly enjoyed watching it!
...
BEST SPEECH (Part of the St. Crispin's Day speech):
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remembered-
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition;
And gentlemen in England now-a-bed
Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

...
The Hollow Crown has been a triumph from the always great BBC. I cannot wait for more!

He did a limited performance of Hamlet at the Royal Academy of Theater this summer.  This is the fourth time that I have watched Hiddleston's Henry V.  You will fall in love when he explains to Catherine of Valois why she should marry him.  Boy, old Shakespeare could really right.

In Season 2, Richard Cumberbatch does a wonderfully sociopathic Richard III.  He scene with Anne Neville at the graves is the most natural performance that I've seen it done.

This review is from: The Hollow Crown - TV Mini Series [DVD] (DVD). It was originally published in the Amazon. UK  in 5 Aug. 2013
I am Brazilian so I grew up watching only the most popular Shakesperean plays. Only Henry V ( the movie with Kenneth Branagh) I knew a little. It was very good for me to watch these historical plays that comprises the group of Shakesperian plays that covers the prelude of the War of the Roses. I liked it very much and Jeremy Irons was superb as Henry IV. Tom Hiddleston as Henry V in the play of Henry IV was little more than a playboy and he played the part very well. As Henry the V his part grew and so his gravitas as a King. I loved his scene with Catherine of Valois, very playful and spoken in French (the original play asks it of the actors). RIchard II I did not knew at all but loved how the actor played the misguided King. The figurines were superb and the castles and rooms looked as I think they should have looked in the 15th century. And as a plus: Subtitles. For a person whose mother language is not english, subtitles for Shakespeare are a necessity. I think that even persons that are born in England or USA these days do not understand the 16th century language of Shakespeare, so subtitles are very good to study the language and to not lose itself in the mele of the dialogues. Very aptly titled: THE HOLLOW CROWN, after the monologue in the first play (Richard II), it describes the fight of men that are cousins and desire above anything to be king (to put the crown of England in his head).

5102454,5,B007P3Q95K,"The Hollow Crown is almost certainly the best drama screened on any TV network (including the Shakespeare-inspired House of Cards) for many a year, a triumph which confirms the BBC as the worlds premier broadcasting network for classics such as this.

With notable exceptions like Henry V and Richard III, Shakespeares history plays are often viewed as difficult to perform and have rarely been committed to film. But in The Hollow Crown this series of plays (The Henriad) is brought to vigorous new life. Every aspect of the production is excellent: A-List and near-perfect casting, fabulous primeval landscape cinematography, great use of surviving mediaeval interiors, gorgeous and convincingly naturalistic costumes, subtle and powerful performances, clever direction allowing the stories to reveal their complexities to a modern audience, and an exciting narrative which holds the attention throughout bringing Shakespeares wonderful, poignant use of language alive as never before.

Highlights of a uniformly excellent series: Ben Whishaws subtle, complex and sympathetic performance as Richard II (the crown-handover scene is surely destined to become one of film historys most dramatically poignant moments); the performance of Jeremy Irons as the older Henry IV, and  the biggest surprise of all - Tom Hiddleston's astounding performance as Henry V which eclipses the benchmark cinematic portrayals by Olivier and Branagh in subtlety and conviction, adding a whole new level of understanding to the character in the process.

Julie Walters says the secret of performing Shakespeare is to deliver the lines like thats the way you naturally speak, and in these productions Shakespeares magnificent language reveals an accessibility rarely achieved before. The intimacy of the camera close-up enables a greater focus on nuance and subtlety in the language, and characters with lesser prominence in the text as a result often come alive on the screen.

Overall: fabulous, brilliant, a feast for the eye, the ear and the mind. The quality of the Blu-Ray BTW is uniformly superb.",1462752000,,2082,5.5141065830721

5102458,5,B007P3Q95K,"Shakespeare's historical plays can be a tough sell -- after all, they are political dramas that most modern people don't know much about.

But ""The Hollow Crown"" is up to that challenge, bringing to life Shakespeare's famous historical tetralogy (""Richard II,"" both parts of ""Henry IV"" and ""Henry V"") with an all-star cast and beautiful direction. The backgrounds are lush and the direction is powerful, but the real credit here goes to Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart, Ben Whishaw and Jeremy Irons.

In ""Richard II,"" a feud between Henry Bolingbroke (Rory Kinnear) and Thomas Mowbray (James Purefoy) leads to a duel... which is interrupted by King Richard II (Whishaw). Instead, the king banishes both men, and snatches the inheritance of Bolingbroke when his father (Patrick Stewart) finally dies. The nobles grow angry, and Bolingbroke begins to build a rebellion against his cousin -- with tragic results.

The story then skips about twenty years into the future for ""Henry IV."" King Henry IV (Irons) -- formerly Bolingbroke -- is troubled by brewing wars with Wales and Scotland, as well as the sudden rebellion of the fiery ""Hotspur"" Percy.

He's also not too happy with his son Hal (Hiddleston), who spends his time frolicking with thieves and pranksters, especially the corpulent Falstaff (Simon Russell Beale). When the Percys revolt against the king, Hal is given the opportunity to prove himself a worthy future king, and sets out to battle, with Falstaff beside him.

Finally, ""Henry V"" follows the new young king as he disarms assassination plots and prepares for the Battle of Agincourt. As he prepares to conquer France, Henry V grapples with his new responsibilities and seeks to find out what his men think of his rule. And he seeks to solidify his eventual victory by wooing a French princess.

""The Hollow Crown"" has the benefit of three directors -- Rupert Goold, Richard Eyre and Thea Sharrock -- and each one directs it in a way that befits the story. Goold's direction is elegant, with lots of soft white light and ornate details; Eyre's is harder and colder, with lots of period grime and slop; and Sharrock's is full of shadows, dirt and blood, but ends with elegance and light once again.

And the entire production has a feeling of respect -- you get the feeling that the people making it know and love Shakespeare's work, and wanted to present it in the best way possible. The sets are impeccable -- from shimmering forests to a grubby little tavern -- and they take the time to explore the comic (Hal doing an impression of his dad) as well as the tragic and dramatic.

As for the cast... they are all brilliant. There are seasoned veterans (Stewart, Irons, John Hurt, David Suchet) acting alongside relative newcomers. Whishaw plays Richard as a floating, effete king who likes cosplaying as Jesus and hanging out with his boyfriends, uncaring about how his kingdom is crumbling around him.

And Hiddleston gives a tour-de-force performance. His Hal is a mischievous, clever young prince who knows he will have to grow up soon, and Hiddleston plays him with equal skill as a prankster and a noble young king. He's easily holding his own among the veterans, while showing charisma enough to convincingly play a monarch.

Sadly Patrick Stewart and James Purefoy don't stick around long, although both of them do good jobs in the time they are there. Suchet gives a powerful late-in-the-game performance, Irons is excellent as a crotchety king who fears for his country's future, and Beale is quite good as the womanizing, boozing rogue Falstaff, who realizes that Hal will eventually cast him off.

""The Hollow Crown"" is a virtually flawless adaptation of Shakespeare's classic Henriad -- and if this can't get you interested in English history, nothing will.",1379721600,2,3787,4.966824644549763

5102462,4,B007P3Q95K,"This collection of plays is really well done - but, in my view, it is not even.  Richard II is the best by far, but I was very disappointed with Henry V.  Here are some more specific comments about this set of performances:

  Richard II stars the young British actor Ben Whishaw who has been very busy of late in ""Cloud Atlas"" and Helen Mirran's ""Tempest.""  For me ""Richard II"" and this performance of the title role was the high point in the entire series.  Whishaw really captures Richard's self love and Christ ideation. The supporting cast was outstanding - led by Patrick Stewart as John of Gaunt and David Suchet (of ""Poirot"" fame) as Edmund, the Duke of York. Unfortunately I could not find an online complete cast list so I cannot identify all the actors.  But in addition to Stewart and Suchet I was also taken with the young actor who played the Duke of Aumerle and the actor who played the Earl of Northumberland. I found this to be the strongest of the 4 films, though there are a couple things worth noting.  1st, I found it very interesting that the director completely changed the ending - eliminating the character of Sir Pierce of Exton, who is the one who Shakespeare appoints to execute Richard.  He is replaced in the films by the character of the Duke of Aumerle, who is York's son and had been one of the conspirators.  By doing this the director strengthened the Christ analogy by having Aumerle play Judas.  It is too bad Shakespeare didn't think of this.  And if you think about it too long it starts to fall apart dramatically.  I think that was a misfire and a mistake.  Also, while I suppose that it is to be expected that plays where there is plenty of sword fights, battles and people having their heads cut off would include some blood and violence.  Nevertheless I found it notable that only Richard II of the 4 had explicit violence - namely the execution by beheading of Bushy and Greene done in all its gory excess. I had expected this to be the norm and was ready for another beheading in Henry IV part 2 (the Archbishop of York and his compatriots) but no.  Bushy and Greene were it - so in retrospect it seems gratuitous.  But there are small details.  On the whole Richard II is a triumph and one of the best Shakespeare films available.

  Next we come to Henry IV - parts 1 & 2.  Led by the stunning performance of Jeremy Irons as King Henry IV and backed by an excellent cast including Tom Hiddleston as Hal and Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff.  Also, Michelle Dockery, of ""Downton Abbey"" fame, plays Kate Percy, and the actor who plays Hotspur (I could not find his name on IMBD or the BBC sites!) are also quite extraordinary.  I especially liked how this Hotspur was completely focused on war and violence even to the point of disregarding his very beautiful wife (who at one point undresses in front of the messenger who gawks at her, even though her husband doesn't seem to notice at all!)  This has always been the way I read the play, but most performances I have seen have Hotspur melting eventually to his wife's charms - but not this Hotspur - he seems immune to the charms of his wife's beauty and her intense and devoted love! I also loved the performance of Henry Faber as the ""good son"" John of Lancaster, Hal's younger brother, who orchestrates with Westmorland the trickery that leads to the capture and execution of the rebellion led by the Archbishop of York.  Faber is fresh faced, innocent, charming, disarming, cold-hearted and merciless in that scene!  He is magnificent!  All of the scenes with Jeremy Irons sparkle, especially his confrontations with Hal. Iron's performance is one of the great film performances of any Shakespeare role IMHO.  I liked the Eastcheap crowd led by Falstaff.  This Falstaff was a little more smarmy than others I have seen who tended to be more jolly.  But Julie Walters as Mistress Quickly is also outstanding.  I have to say, that in contrast to the theater where my experience is that these scenes can steal the show, for me in the film version they seemed claustrophobic and I was always glad to return to Court or the battlefield.  I should give a shout out to the actor who plays Justice Shallow.  This was a sensitive and moving portrayal of a character who is usually just a joke or the butt of a joke.  I also should say that found it a little disconcerting that the few characters who were in both Richard II and Henry IV were played by different actors.  I would have preferred the same actors to play their roles in the whole series, except when age prevents it.  The exception would be Bollingbrook to King Henry IV - they are drastically different characters.  But I cannot for the life of me understand why they would have replaced the terrific Northumberland from Richard II.  There are some small cuts which are annoying - we never see John of Lancaster saving his father during the battle of Shrewsbury and we do not see why Falstaff is laying as if dead on the ground (he was attacked by Douglas in the play - but not in the film).  Minor cuts, true, but kind of needless in my view.

  When we come to Henry V then the cuts take center stage as the number #1 weakness of this film.  The character of Captain Gower is eliminated and all of the banter between him and Fluellen is cut. But the worst cut is the removal of the conspiracy scene.  Olivier cut this scene from the film back when he filmed Henry V during World War II, and then it was a conscious choice for wartime and political reasons.  I am not sure if there were such reasons this time around, but for me it ruins the narrative and turns it into a jingoistic ride to the glorious victory at Agincourt.  I cannot imagine any good reason to cut this scene.  It doesn't take that long and it deepens the narrative.  This is, in my view the single worst thing about this series. On the other hand, I thought turning the boy (Falstaff's page) into the chorus at the end was brilliant.  Even so, sorry to say the battle scene at Agincourt is not as good as the Kenneth Branagh film in my view.  There was certainly more attention paid to historical accuracy in the battle scene in the Branagh film.  They pass over the French murder of the boys at the baggage train with barely a mention, and if you want to really want to understand how it was possible for Henry to win the battle of Agincourt when the odds were so stacked against him you will have to consult another source because you won't get many hints here - except perhaps divine intervention or luck.  The Branagh film devotes enough time to the long bow archers and the field conditions that one can get a better sense of why the French lost this battle.  I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston as Henry, though I liked him better as Hal.  He is a fine actor and I would love to see him do these roles on stage.  Other complaints: I did not like that Henry had no part in the hanging of Bardolph.  The hanging was over by the time Henry finds out about it.  That weakens his character and the play.  I also did not like the delivery of the famous St. Crispen's Day speech for his small group of officers.  It somehow took the power out of the speech. As mentioned above Fluellen is a cipher in this production, and nothing really matters except Agincourt.  Even so, there are fine performances by Catherine of Valois and the Duke of Exeter.  I also enjoyed the performance of the French actor who played Montjoy. (Curious that French actors were cast in most of the French roles, excepting the King - it was rather glaring he and the Dauphin that he was the only French character without a French accent.)
  In conclusion I would say that it is definitely is worth watching and owning this series.  Richard II is the strongest, Henry V is the weakest.  Wikipedia lists this series as ""The Hollow Crown, part 1.""  Does this mean that we can expect a part 2?  Henry VI, parts 1, 2, 3 to Richard III perhaps?  That would be nice.  But next time, go easy on the cuts please and keep the casts stable from play to play.  It adds to the strength of the production.",1368489600,,8080,4.437202987101154
5102463,4,B007P3Q95K,"""The Hollow Crown"" contains Shakespeare's plays ""Richard II"" and all the plays relating to Henry V (""Henry IV"" parts I and II, and ""Henry V"").  The BBC has done two other notable versions of these plays, ""An Age of Kings"" (1960) and the Shakespeare Plays series version in 1979.  This is the best by far.

The earlier versions had drawbacks, despite fine casts.  The 1960 series was hampered by the crudities of British television of that time, and looks like it went out live.  The 1979 Henriad cycle was done on videotape in long takes (like most BBC television at the time). The 1979 Falstaff, Anthony Quayle, is considered one of the best Falstaffs of his generation, but his performance was obviously honed on the stage and was simply too large and boisterous for the small screen.  And 1979's Henry V, David Gwillim, was a fine actor but not persuasive as Henry.  And this version was done on a sound stage and feels stage-bound.

""The Hollow Crown"" (2012) has all the advantages of up-to-date television.  It perhaps compensates for the old way of shooting, with a steady camera, by too much camera movement.  It expands out, to give wide views of battlefields.  It tries to bring the early 1400s to life (though it may concentrate too much on the more unsightly elements).

The acting is uniformly excellent.  Who could be a better Shakespearean actor than Jeremy Irons, to lead the cast as Henry IV?  Simon Russell Beale, whom I know from his numerous appearances on BBC radio, is a remarkably lifelike Falstaff.  He does not overplay a role that tempts the actor into big voices and gestures.  He's also the first television Falstaff I've ever chuckled at.  Soliloquies are performed as voice-overs, and Beale is able to get serious near the battle with his speech on honor.

Richard II, not one of Shakespeare's strongest plays, is a decent ""exposition"" play.  Henry IV parts I and II are masterfully done.

The question is, how does Henry V stack up, since it is supposed to cap this tetralogy?  It's worthiness is especially important since this Henry V will inevitably (and unfairly) be compared to Branagh's masterful motion picture version.

Cleverly, and audaciously for a first-time film director with few motion picture acting credits, Kenneth Branagh populated his ""Henry V"" with a veritable who's-who of great British actors, who enunciated four hundred year old lines to sound impromptu.

Perhaps intentionally, ""The Hollow Crown"" runs counter to Branagh's ""Henry V.""  For instance, Branagh's Exeter was Brian Blessed, a mountain of a man (and an Everest climber) whose delivery is extremely forceful. In ""The Hollow Crown"" Exeter is Anton Lesser, who at sixty looks frail, and who had a quiet delivery even in his confrontation with the Dauphin.

Perhaps the biggest question is, how does Henry V himself, Tom Hiddleston, stack up?  He's good.  And he has an advantage lost to Branagh, who had to establish his Henry immediately.  Hiddleston was able to grow into Henry from Prince Hal through two earlier plays.  Hiddleston's Crispin's Day speech was disappointing.  While David Gwillim simply stood there reciting the words and Branagh used the speech as a magniloquent showcase, Hiddleston delivers the Crispin's Day speech quietly, to a few people (one in particular).

As (for the most part) with Beale's Falstaff, there seemed to be a conscious decision to forgo bombast in the small-screen approach to Henry's Crispin's Day speech.  This is totally a matter of taste(especially following Henry's heart-felt prayer for God to overlook the fault of his own father in overthrowing Richard II, which can lead to a Henry filled with zeal, as was Branagh; or to a sober and contrite Henry who understands what he's asking his followers to do).

But since, in this case, the speech introduces the climax of a four-play marathon, I would have preferred to see a few (metaphorical -- and rhetorical) rabbits pulled from hats.  Hiddleston's Henry was trying to persuade a few of his men rationally and matter-of-factly;  while I want a Henry, whether on the stage, the big screen, or the small screen, who persuades the audience.  It's the viewer who needs to believe Henry would fight the battle all alone if everyone else deserted him in the face of a much larger French army.

So, only a few quibbles, and those are subjective.  Otherwise, ""The Hollow Crown"" is the best Henriad out there and worth getting your mitts on (I got mine from the UK for a region-free player, and both were wise investments).

I only hope someone gets the big idea to do the next (or, for sticklers, the first) tetralogy, which climaxes with Richard III  This would be a boon to civilization, as the Henry VI plays have been treated shabbily in previous versions.  In ""An Age of Kings"" (1960) they are done as well as the technology of the time allowed, but they are heavily truncated);  and the Shakespeare Plays version of the first tetralogy (1983) was done in a childish way, with actors wearing mock-horses around their midriffs.  Shameful. Hey, now they can make ""Richard III"" with new historical data, since they've uncovered his bones and have a more accurate idea about to his deformities.",1365552000,2,5199,4.907216494845361

I've been reduced to watching scenes and snippets on Youtube, and in the highly enjoyable ""Shakespeare Uncovered"" series that aired on PBS earlier this year.

Yes, the productions are elegant and magnificently detailed, but the acting (what I've seen, in the snippets) is truly formidable. Jeremy Irons, always a pleasure to watch and listen to with his dark, gravelly voice and intense delivery, offers up a smoldering Henry IV, brooding king and dissatisfied papa to the party-loving Prince Hal. Simon Russell Beale is well cast as Falstaff, and Tom Hiddleston makes a fine transition from the roistering young Hal to a dynamic Henry V. Perhaps the most riveting performance, however, is delivered by Ben Whishaw as the psychologically complex and politically inept Richard II. With his fragile frame, delicate tenor voice, and ability to transform himself from an ethereal, self-absorbed, arrogant brat, completely convinced of the divine right of kings, to the quietly introspective prisoner of the final scene, he is masterful. Rory Kinnear is excellent as Bolingbroke, Patrick Stewart is a moving John of Gaunt, and the direction (in this case, by Rupert Goold) is quite interesting.

Five Stars (and then some)

This adaptation was very well acted, filmed, and staged. In fact, Ben Whishaw is now my new favourite actor -- I'd seen him before in Bright Star and Brideshead Revisited and he was good; seeing him in Shakespeare, however, is nothing short of a treat.
The cuts in this production were few and made with much more skill than in the other plays. Every actor delivered his lines with feeling and understanding, and the physical acting was well-suited to the words. At times the acting went a bit overboard, but only when Shakespeare's language or the story being told goes overboard (the surrendering scene, with the looking-glass and the crown, featured a deposed Richard rolling around on the floor).
The filming, costumes and sets were gorgeous, which only made the great acting and Shakespeare's beautiful writing shine all the more.
Parallels with Christ and St. Sebastian were perhaps belaboured a bit much visually, but this is the only flaw, and a small one at that. Belabouring the parallel is in itself all right, but it did start to get old.
Many small cuts were made, but these were skilfully done and nothing was cut that would change the story.
There was one small change to the plot. They replaced Exton at the end of the play with Aumerle. Surprisingly, it worked.
Also, Henry Percy was left out entirely; this was somewhat disappointing, but since he figures largely in 1 Henry IV and these productions imply that many years pass between the two plays, it would be very difficult to rectify the time if Percy was not cut.

Henry IV (both parts)
Four Stars

These two were good. They suffered from some cuts (The King's whining about not being able to go to the Holy Land was neatly snipped out, for example) but were well acted, well filmed and overall a good pair of movies.
I wasn't very impressed, but then I'm not very impressed with these two plays on paper; I don't think I'll ever come to like Falstaff and Pistol no matter who plays them. I like Shakespeare for the beautiful writing and the in-depth character studies and the complex political intrigue and the elaborate punning insults. I'm not much a fan of fat jokes and pee jokes and plots which revolve around a bunch of thugs getting drunk and robbing each other;, but this is what a good portion of Henry IV is comprised of.
Despite this, however, this was a good version of these plays. It had some superb acting, especially Jeremy Irons as The King and Joe Armstrong as Henry Percy.

Henry V
Four Stars

Overall, it was good, but it was lacking in some ways. Tom Hiddleston as Henry is good, though I have seen better.
A few of the cuts (uncut Shakespeare is too much to expect from any film adaptation) made a good deal of sense (""no king of England if not king of France"" was divorced from its rhyming couplet, making it actually more meaningful [especially considering that Hiddleston sort of gnawed on and pronounced as ditties the rhyming couplets elsewhere in the play]), a few were disappointing simply because I wanted to see something which they cut out (the whole scene with the traitors, the French bragging about their armour and horses), and some just made no sense (boys and luggage).

Most of the comic relief was lopped out of the play; this works, but it changes the overall tone to something more sombre. Gower, Macmorris and, Jamy were entirely omitted, and Fluellen's part was reduced to ""Captain with Welsh accent""; no lengthy rambles about Romans, and no lines beginning with things like ""do you think that therefore it is meet"" and no ""Alexander the Pig"", and no amusing lists of synonyms.
No leek-whacking scene, either -- like the Branagh adaptation, Pistol breaks down part way though the battle, so we also miss the ""fir and ferret and firk"" scene.

And they cut out the whole thing with the boys and the luggage but left in the order to kill the French prisoners. It's cause and effect, if you want to cut the cause, you have to either cut the effect or substitute a different cause.
Hiddleston gets a KHAAAAN moment and shouts up at the sky ""I was not angry since I came to France until this instant!"" for seemingly no reason at all. Actually, this is the only cut that really made no sense; the rest were only a bit disappointing.

Also, Henry's tendency to attribute everything to God was neatly pared down, presumably to make it more palatable to a non-religious audience. It wasn't entirely omitted, though, which, as someone capable of seeing a play the way the original audience saw it, I appreciate.

Hiddleston's Henry is mostly a personable and affable king; the St. Crispin's Day and ""Once more unto the breach"" speeches were believable and the wooing of Katharine was sufficiently awkward (though it was heavily trimmed, notably the ""have my babies"" bit). Unlike Branagh (who conveys an exuberant braggadocio tempered by a cold unfeeling) and Olivier (who spends the entire movie posing and being a grand and exalted king), Hiddleston gives the character a full range of human emotion, the subdued fire of the tennis balls scene was quite good.
Occasionally he's too obviously reading lines of a play (rhyming couplets, hello), but mostly what we have is a good actor doing a convincing job of being King Harry the Fift.",1358985600,3,5282,4.71397616468039
5102470,5,B007P3Q95K,"My exposure to Shakespeare has been limited to say the least.  The closest I've  ever come was seeing ""Much Ado About Nothing"" on Broadway years ago.  Didn't understand a word of it.  But I've always wondered how I might begin to understand.  I've tried reading various plays and sonnets, caught a few movies interpreting his plays, and always got lost early on.  I bought this boxed set to try yet one more time and finally!  The door opened.

The set depicts the reigns of three successive English medieval kings.  There are four discs: Richard II, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and Henry V.  The stories are riveting and, I think, more understandable as you'll recognize many of the principal actors (Jeremy Irons, for example).  And it has subtitles!  What a simple and brilliant idea.  For the first time I could follow the stories.  Credit also goes to the vivid performances of all the actors involved.

I'm told one of the differences between this production and previous ones is that the language was delivered in prose as opposed to verse.  Meaning, I think, that they spoke as modern day people do, but the lines are still in Shakespearean language.  I'll leave that to the Shakespearean purists.  All I know is I have, at long last, found my doorway into Shakespeare.

FYI:  I bought mine at Amazon.co.uk.  As of this writing, the price at the Brit Amazon is $22.23 for the complete set including shipping.

UPDATE:  Just bought this set for a friend -- 2/17/2013.  The price is now $25.70 including shipping.",1357603200,7,1515,4.716475095785441

The overall production value of the plays was wonderful, and the casting was perfect.  Rory Kinnear as young Henry IV in ""Richard II"" was masterful.  I finished all four episodes in one week-end, and look forward the Season 2 for next week-end.",1526860800,,344,4.796610169491525

I purchased this product, and have watched each play at least 3 times already. I might add, while following the print copy of the play from a book, this production is just about near verbatim that I could tell at this time.  That makes it even more special.",1523404800,,393,4.666666666666667
8520090,5,B007P3Q95K,This is the best collection of Shakespeare I have found. Incredible actors acting incredibly! It is fantastic to finally be able to enjoy The Bard while actually understanding him. I doubt you'll be displeased with this purchase. AND it will be good for your children to get this little bit of culture.,1522108800,,302,4.826923076923077
