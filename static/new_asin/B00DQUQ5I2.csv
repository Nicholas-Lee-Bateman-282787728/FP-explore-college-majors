8596455,5,B00DQUQ5I2,"I grew up watching old movies like the Little Rascals and all the great comedies of the 20s, 30s and 40s.  Buster Keaton is my all-time favorite, but there were so many others who were just as terrific and Ben Turpin is one of them.  This guy was not only funny and funny looking but he knew it and you can tell by his antics.  Comedy like this doesn't need sound - just watching will have the viewer in stitches.  Love it!",1466553600,,423,4.121951219512195
