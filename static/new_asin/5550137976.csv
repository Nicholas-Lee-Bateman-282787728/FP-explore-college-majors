And old!  Gave me a new insight about the Guards at the Tomb!",1364860800,3,161,4.366666666666666
204981,5,5550137976,I highly recommend this story to all.  This is the first I have ever considered the soldiers point of view who was on duty for the Golgotha detail and also those that guarded the tomb.  Excellent viewing in my opinion.,1360454400,7,218,4.425
204982,1,5550137976,"This film could have been so much better if it hadn't attempted to make Roman soldiers talk like modern military or police. Most dialogue set in Bible times will at least stay free from modern slang, so that there's no feeling that the characters are modern people dressed in costumes. The basic idea of the movie is to show the resurrection from the point of view of the Roman soldiers who were assigned to the crucifiction and the guarding of Jesus' tomb. What they witnessed, the cover-up, and the inconsistencies that the Roman soldiers knew about are important proofs that the resurrection of Jesus is factual. As I watched, I was drawn into the story, then repelled over and over by the incongruity of modern-sounding speech coming out of the soldiers' mouths; you almost expected them to compare plans for the weekend. I think the purpose was to show us that soldiers know their profession and the politics of the various groups they deal with; they can tell when a lie is being told, and they have an idea who's behind a cover-up, just as a team of police or firefighters know most of what's going on in their departments. Making them sound like people of our own time seems good in theory, but in practice they come across as phony; given a choice, we believe a person is what he sounds like, rather than how he's dressed. Just when believeability and genuineness were needed, the filmmakers tried to give us people we could relate to. They could have taken lessons from other great Bible movies that have been made, and successfully drawn us into first century Palestine. Then we could relate to them as we experience their emotions at witnessing this central miracle of the Bible.",1336348800,6,1691,4.696969696969697
204983,2,5550137976,"I could not finish the movie.  The idea was okay but the execution was too oriented to the ""already Christians,"" and like so many insider stories, lacks a really critical review for quality. It assumes the Christian viewers will accept it simply because it is a Christian movie.",1317945600,,278,4.791666666666667
204984,5,5550137976,"This is one of my absolute favorite Christian films. The plot, acting, presentation, etc. is excellent. It's the story of Christ's death and resurrection, and the aftermath, from a fresh perspective. I got a lot more out of the story by seeing it this way. It's a very moving film. I get emotional watching it.",1305072000,5,310,4.654545454545454
204985,3,5550137976,"Resurrection is a good film, very appropriate for Easter. The overall production is not as slick as a big budget film but it is definitely worth seeing. I would welcome more films like this from Lucado, who is an excellent author and speaker.",1302480000,7,242,4.651162790697675
204986,5,5550137976,"This story is truly moving and intense.  The story of a Roman soldier, recently assigned to the execution detail, and coming to terms with what he witnessed.  Thought provoking and truly amazing.  After viewing, if you were  that Roman soldier, what would you do?",1206144000,4,263,4.909090909090909
204987,5,5550137976,Great person to deal with.,1415318400,,26,4.4
204988,1,5550137976,"If the resurrection happened in ""happy talk"" American Protestant place this is movie is believable. I did think the actors were good at acting with such a poor and contrived story line.  But the story line I am sure is not close to any possible thinking of what happened to the Roman Soldiers after the resurrection.  You only have to know a little of what it meant to be a Roman soldier to know the fictional events could not have happened the way this movie portrays it.  I have not read the book, so I do not know if there is a great difference between the book and the movie.",1411171200,,579,4.245454545454545
204989,5,5550137976,"First time I have purchased from you ..I am very pleased..beautiful dvd ,very inspiring ,arrived well and quickly ,will  delight in shopping with you again....Love Max's dvd and books ....Thankyou for a perfect transaction ...God Bless...",1401235200,3,238,5.611111111111111
204990,3,5550137976,"I thought it was confusing. If a person did not already know the story, it would not meant much. I doubt that Max Lucado approved of what was done to his work. It was effective and interesting, but could have been so much better with a little context work added.",1395964800,4,262,4.26
204991,5,5550137976,"Thanks for this one.  Give us more of these type stories, Max. This is better than Twilight Zone - truth stranger than fiction.",1388707200,,127,4.521739130434782
204992,5,5550137976,I love this story. It is a unique presentation of the resurrection of Jesus from the perspective of the Roman soldiers who were at the crucifiction & resurrection.,1378771200,,163,4.857142857142857
204993,5,5550137976,Awesome short film showing the resurrection in a realistic way. Good film for searching souls. Movie is about a soldier searching for the truth.,1371081600,,144,5.041666666666667
204994,4,5550137976,Showed this movie to my students right after Easter. They found it interesting because they have never heard or seen a movie from the Centurion's view point!,1366416000,2,157,4.851851851851852
204995,5,5550137976,"I liked this DVD very much, because it sticks to the Biblical record as much as it can, it doesn't labour any points, it has atmosphere, excitement and challenges the viewer to a faith in Christ",1366243200,,194,4.416666666666667
204996,5,5550137976,A very powerful and moving story. It was very appropriate for the retreat I did on resurrection. I would use it again.,1365724800,,118,4.409090909090909

7802348,4,5550137976,"I already had this movie on VHS, but it was well past upgrade time.  It is a nice short story, with fair to good actors, telling about what happen to the soldier who killed Jesus.  Not in the bible, but who knows, it could have happen.  I like it.",1461369600,2,247,4.0
7802349,3,5550137976,Enjoyed movie but a little slow paced,1458345600,,37,4.428571428571429
7802350,5,5550137976,Not your standard crucifixion movie. Follows the soldiers that did it in a way that The Robe never covered. A behind the scenes look that is excellent.,1452124800,,151,4.62962962962963
