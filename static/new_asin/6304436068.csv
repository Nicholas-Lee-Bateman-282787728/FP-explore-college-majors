The product worked out fine. I was a big fan of this movie when it came out in the late 90's. My only complaint is that it has not been released on dvd yet.",1453852800,,164,3.6857142857142855

Directed by Albert Pynn (Cyborg, Nemesis Series, The Sword and the Sorcerer) made a familiar action-flick... the Film is Surprisngly Entertaining but If it Wasn't for the Clusmy Writting, Direction and Bad Visual Effects. Blast could have been a Terrific Movie. Watch Close for Shannon Elizabeth. Clairmont-Scope. Grade:B-.",1019174400,,590,5.287234042553192
7870891,3,6304436068,"On the whole, this is the sort of action movie that comes to the public by the hundreds. A group of evil terrorists take a couple of helpless girls hostage, a burned out, stand-alone hero saves the day and that is about it  as far as the plot is concerned. However, as far as the standard formula  goes, it is quite well done. For one thing, a number of hosages actually  gets killed, making the story more realistic then usual. For another, the  cast seriously tries to develope the characters they are supposed to play.  Handicapped by the rather two-dimensional script they do not succeed  completely, but at least the intention is there. The rest of the movie is  made up out of explosions, some good martial arts and even the occasional  comic releave. ( A legless Hauer floating in the water is quite a funny  sight ). All in all, nothing special, but quite worth watching.",950659200,5,879,4.547770700636943
