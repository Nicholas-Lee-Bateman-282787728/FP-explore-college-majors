5274629,5,B0096W46PS,"Welcome to QUINCY, M.E., one of the most enjoyable and influential television shows in the history of the boob tube. This is the story of Dr. Quincy -- no first name ever given! -- a crusty, hot-tempered, do-gooding Los Angeles County medical examiner (Jack Klugman) who uses forensic science to unravel mysteries which leave his cop friends Lieutenant Monohan (Garry Walberg) and Sergeant Brill (Joe Roman), and his paper-pushing fop of a boss, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) scratching their respective heads. Of course when Quincy is not solving murder mysteries he is taking up a lance for every public-spirited cause you can possibly think of, from child abuse to teenage drug use to illegal immigration to punk rock music and beyond. Can't fight City Hall? Quincy treats City Hall like a rock-'em-sock-'em robot!

Of course, in so doing, he aggravates absolutely everyone, from murderers, who try to kill him, to big corporations, who try to muzzle him, to his girlfriends (he has thousands), who try to leave him, to his long-suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito) and best friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio) who just try to put up with him. Half the fun of QUINCY is seeing the enraged or baffled  expressions of everyone who crosses his path. Imagine a fiery liberal muckraker with a medical degree and a nose (a BIG nose) for mysteries and a taste for the ladies, and you've got this show in a nutshell.

Some of my favorite episodes are:

""The Last Six Hours"" - After witnessing a car accident, Quincy tries to solve a mysterious string of deaths related to the impounded auto, deaths which may include Sam if he doesn't work fast.

""Death by Good Intentions"" -- The death of a patient in the ER leads to a re-evaluation of the Affirmative Action program in an L.A. hospital, causing a prominent black surgeon to take the fall for an inexperienced colleague -- though not of Quincy has anything to say about it.

""Images"" -- The appearance of famous anchorwoman Jessica Ross causes Quince much embarrassment when she turns up very much alive at the press conference at which he just announced her death.

""A Night to Raise the Dead"" -- A mudslide unearths a cemetery whose corpses are infected with typhoid, threatening a massive epidemic.

""A Question of Death"" -- After Quince declares a patient dead and the body is harvested for organs, an ambulance-chasing shyster convinces the family he acted too hastily and brings a suit against him.

""The Depth of Beauty"" -- Quince wages all-out war against an incompetent, assembly-line plastic surgeon whose bungling has lead to mutilations and suicides.

""Physician, Heal Thyself"" -- When a young woman bleeds out in a doctor's waiting room, it's discovered her ""routine"" abortion was handled by a drunken surgeon.

""Semper Fidelis"" -- The mysterious death of a Marine recruit pits Quincy against the U.S.M.C.

""An Ounce of Prevention"" -- Investigating a construction worker's death, Quincy discovers toxins leaking from an illegal waste dump are the cause, and takes on the company responsible.

""The Death Challenge"" -- Quincy's investigation of the death of a magician puts him at odds with an old friend determined to pull off the dangerous trick or die trying.

""Eye of the Needle"" -- Quincy struggles to determine whether holistic healing techniques cost the life of a patient, and on his investigation hangs the reputation and career of a dedicated doctor.

In addition to these, the moving two-parter ""Walk Softly Through the Night"" is a gutty examination of doctors who dispense drugs like Pez dispensers, irregardless of the consequences, which features three excellent and frequently-used character actors on the show: A Martinez, Charles Aidman, and Spencer Milligan (of ""Land of the Lost"" fame). And the touching episode ""Promises to Keep"" finally reveals much-awaited backstory about Quincy, which explains why such a gifted surgeon decided to become a forensic pathologist.

QUINCY was and remains a unique series in the annals of television. It was neither a medical program nor a mystery show, but combined both elements and also introduced audiences to the world of forensic pathology -- twenty years before CSI hit the airwaves. At the same time its structure was equally unique, in that two-thirds of the storylines were about causes which the producers, and Jack Klugman, felt needed a champion, or evils which needed to be exposed to the viewing public: autism, the ""code of silence"" in medicine, toxic waste dumping, plastic surgery malpractice, dangerous airline regulations, affirmative action and organ donation are all subjected to the ill-tempered Quincy treatment. It's true that by modern standards the show is sappy and heavy-handed, that the technology is laughably outdated, and so on, but it's also true that nearly every ""cause"" tackled by QUINCY has yet to be resolved today. Some shows date badly, and others remain timely while having a wonderful sense of nostalgia. QUINCY is the latter. So the next time you're in L.A., give him a ring. You may be murdered during the visit, but I guarantee he will find out who did it.",1415577600,5,5117,5.023612750885478
5274630,5,B0096W46PS,"Jack Klugman is a great actor and Season 4 Quincy is a must see, highlighting Quincy's tenacious character as he strives to find the truth. Quincy has integrity and humanity. I love this character!",1413417600,2,197,4.823529411764706
5274631,5,B0096W46PS,"I enjoyed this when I was a kid, and I still do. If you enjoy all of the forensic shows on TV today, you'll probably enjoy this as well.",1413417600,2,136,3.7241379310344827

It taught me a lot, and the cast is very good. Between Astin, Monahan, and Quincy getting fired up at each other, Quincy was usually right.

This 1978-79 Season finds Quincy looking to prove a well-known celebrity is an imposter, investigating the 'accidental' death of a professional car racer, discovering mummified remains in his friend's apartment, on a quest to shut down a dirty doctor's illegal prescription peddling business, getting critically injured while working a case and more!

I ordered Seasons 4 and 5 through Best Buy and had no problems with the discs.  I'm glad they're single sided unlike Universal DVD's.  I'm planning to get Season 6 soon and hope Shout releases them in the frequent fashion they have been doing.  I've been waiting to get this entire series for many years.

5274658,5,B0096W46PS,"Quincy continues on his quest to find answers to murders and unexplained deaths while at the same time championing social causes and medical innovations to improve conditions for the living.  For example, one of the episodes in this season dealt with autism. This was probably the first time most people watching the show at that time (1978) had been exposed to this topic.  Had no clue what it was before then.  The series was the forerunner for shows like Bones, CSI, and Body of Proof.  Medical examiner stories were never done before on a weekly basis.  Not as graphic as the current shows in the depiction of remains and autopsy procedures (you never saw Quincy actually working on bodies with the camera was always positioned above them) but no less enjoyable for it and it never failed to capture your interest.",1371168000,3,818,4.773049645390071

Quincy (Jack Klugman, may he rest in peace) had no need for all the equipment we see now but you do see a version of many of the oldtime 'stuff' that 'they' used in the 'olden' days. Quincy is funny; he wit many times getting him in trouble but he solves his crimes by brainpower and a few do-hinkeys and watching any of his old shows is a joy.  You'll see how they did things unlike CSI or Bones (etc.) any of the series we have now. Check it out-you won't be sorry! If you are a fan of Columbo you'll be a fan of Quincy!
