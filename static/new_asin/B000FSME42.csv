8126154,5,B000FSME42,"Funny show, not for the weak hearted, works perfectly fine and sounds great. One of the coolest show I ever saw, worth way more than the price tag.",1330560000,,147,4.285714285714286
8126155,5,B000FSME42,"Very funny show - fans of Beavis and Butthead - this is your style. The show is quick witted, smart, and provides good social commentary without ODing.",1185840000,2,151,4.62962962962963
8126156,5,B000FSME42,"This show is a show that exists. It is so epileptic it inspires one to thank Yuggoth, sodomize a 7 year old boy and praise lucifer under a burning idol of Molech. All Manchurian Candidates please Forgo Beta and please initiate Omega alters now, please. I was most impressed by the Background illustrations of Chico's Grandma's Exterior apt, The lighter that Guapo held and The back of the comedy club that Chico bombed. I thought the other BGs paled in comparison and the animation supervision left much to be desired. I will admit however that the consistency of Guapo's animation was top notch and the detailed plethora of pantomimes the animators gave Guapo to express different core meta-mortal states was staggering. I also appreiciate the significance of the encoding behind his finger gestures. Hopefully the veiwing of such subtle complexities will bring about the true ritual significance of meaning, just like JFK's Sacrifice and the Hegelian machine known as 911 to bring upon the thousand penised black goat to wash the flesh from this earth - ALL HAIL SHUB NIGGURATH!!!!! 1776, 666, Chaka, Will, Holly.",1162771200,7,1115,5.032432432432432
8126157,4,B000FSME42,"This is a really crazy show, when I first saw the previews I thought it looked very cheap, which it turns out it does.  The art and animation are pretty low quality.  But I think that actually add's to the charm of the show. I can't say I was hooked the first time I watched it, but i did find it ammusing so I watched the next one.  If Beavis & Butthead were a bit smarter, and Latino this would be them. They argue back and fort, and of course come up with horrible ideas which always backfire. The premise of the show is they work for a record label as janitors.  They have a crazy boss, a crazy secratery, a gay (black) music producer and Chico's teenage cousin who's a wiz at making music.  I can't explain the show other then you need to watch it to see what the hell it's about.  The Episodes are short, even shorter then a typical Beavis & Butthead. And they all revolve around Chico & Guapo getting into some sort of trouble.  Even people with a nonexistant attention spand should be able to sit through one.  Afterwards they flip around TV channels and talk about what they see. Just like B&B, only they don't do music videos.  And again, these segements are so short even if you don't like them, it'll be on to another cartoon before you know it. The humor is pretty low brow, and bizzare at times. But the show has a very warm and fun vibe to it. This is no B&B, South Park or Family Guy. But it is a very original cartoon that has the potential to get better and see it's audiance grow.",1158796800,5,1499,4.177083333333333
