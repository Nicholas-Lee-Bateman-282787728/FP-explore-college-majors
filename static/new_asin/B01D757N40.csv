8755142,5,B01D757N40,"This dvd (in the series) is difficult to find. I have been periodically searching for this dvd for years and finally found one on Amazon. I was lucky and managed to get the last one that was available.

The paper case cover is double sided. One side is clean and the other side is naughty. The clean side is perfect if you want this item to be out in the open while still hiding it from prying eyes. The special features are lackluster. Like all other ASM titles, this dvd has a ""straight to s*x"" feature if you want to get into the action right away.

If you do find this dvd online be sure to get confirmation from the seller that it is a ""US"" release. It has been a hassle ordering this item. The reason why is because this dvd is also available as a ""UK"" release. I had ordered this item two times (from different sellers) and both times I had asked the sellers to make sure that the dvd was a US release. Instead, they sent me a UK release. The UK release is PAL (Europe) region coded and it will not play in North America. After ordering from a third seller, I finally received a US release of this dvd.

California is flooded with UK releases of this dvd.

The UK release has specific markings on the case, disc label, and disc underside. I will describe them.

1. On the front, side, and back of the case a rating of ""R18"" will be stated. R18 will also be stated on the disc label. R18 is a European rating.

The US release does not have a rating stated.

2. The UK release has ""UK distribution by Scala"" stated on the back of the case. This confirms that the dvd was manufactured in Europe.

The US release does not have a distribution stated.

3. The UK release has ""PAL / UK"" stated on the disc underside. This confirms that the dvd is PAL region coded. Warning! The back of the case will state ""NTSC"" and ""All Regions"", these are typos.

The US release does not have a region code stated on the disc underside.

This dvd has the same characteristics as the others in this series. If you have previously seen this series you will not be surprised when you watch this dvd. If you are new to this series you will be shocked. Night Shift Nurses has many disturbing characteristics. Mentally prepare yourself and tread carefully.",1473206400,,2236,4.3
