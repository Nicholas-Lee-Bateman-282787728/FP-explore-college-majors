2701084,4,B000LAZQH6,"This is a great and educational documentary about the Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War. The video goes touches on the little-known aspect of the unsung and often dismissed part the Coast Guard has played in wartime. I only wish everybody, even Coasties themselves, could watch this and realize what the service has done for the country. I hope the producers decide to create additional volumes for each other war.",1189900800,,425,5.0

8160490,5,B000LAZQH6,This DVD was made with a large portion dedicated to our WESTPAC tour in Viet Nam. The two officers interviewed were the operations officer of the Chase and the Chase CO Wayne Caldwell. It was good to hear their voices. The content of the video adds yet another chapter to the Coast Guard story.,1457740800,,294,4.462962962962963

8160492,4,B000LAZQH6,What you never knew about the fifth military branch. Because they rarely tell anyone about it.,1431129600,,94,4.9375
8160493,5,B000LAZQH6,"Again, another great quality video with clear and concise picture.  Great video of Coast Guard ships throughout history and their missions.  A couple of grainy clips, but overall great product.  Would buy from seller again.",1353110400,,223,5.314285714285714

8160495,5,B000LAZQH6,"I just ran across this and ordered it. It is about time ""OUR"" story was told. I served aboard the CGC Halfmoon that was one of the first five ships of the newly formed CG Squadron 3. We went on line on 3 June 1967. We were homeported in NYC ( CG Base Staten Island and then CG Base Governor's Island). Charlie S.",1220313600,4,312,3.9682539682539684
8160496,5,B000LAZQH6,"Excellent DVD. Tells the little known story of the many different missions the Coast Guard had in the Vietnam War. I was in the Coast Guard and thought I knew what the Coast Guard did in the Vietnam war, boy did I learn a lot. Well worth buying.",1217116800,,245,4.125
8160497,5,B000LAZQH6,"Kudos to Tam and Sue Fraser of the Coast Guard Channel for producing this little known story about the Coast Guard's involvment in the Vietnam War. Any viewer will be amazed to learn not only was the Coast Guard requested by the Navy in 1965, the Coast Guard was needed to fill missions with the Army and Air Force as well. This DVD will keep you on the edge of your seat as the actual Coast Guard combat veterans who were there tell their stories of courage and valor against the backdrop of actual footage from Americas longest war. The Coast Guard motto ""Semper Paratus"" (Always Ready) will be confirmed over and over again as each mission is described in detail. Only 8,000 Coasties served in Vietnam over the course of the war but they proved that the smallest branch of our military stands ready to answer the call as they have done since 1790. I know all this to be true as I am one of those Coasties who were there. Now that our story has finally been told I hope that I never have to hear this question again when I tell someone that I am a Coast Guard Vietnam Veteran, ""What was the Coast Guard doing in Vietnam?""",1191283200,8,1123,4.327014218009479
