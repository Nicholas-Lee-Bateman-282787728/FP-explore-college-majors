6979818,5,B00SC18CAE,"I waited for this digitized version for a long time. I am a retired History teacher who used the VHS version when I taught US History. The images, the script, the narration by Alexander Scourby, and the music of Richard Rogers combine to produce the best documentary I have seen. Every time I showed it to my class I had to stand in back of the classroom at the end of the film because the imagery of the troops arriving home in a ship in New York harbor with the Statue of Liberty in the foreground with the strains of ""No Other Love."" playing in the background was overwhelmingly.
This is the condensed movie version of the 26 week series which played on Sundays on B&W TV in the 1950's using actual film footage and narrated by Richard Basehart. As a teenager I had the privilege of viewing this magnificent series. The soundtrack is also available. I highly recommend the movie and the soundtrack.",1439251200,,901,4.5

6979823,5,B00SC18CAE,"I am very pleased with this release from Film Chest Media Group. The 26 episode serial version is easy to find, but until now, its been difficult to find the feature version. The visuals have been restored from a 16mm dupe print and the soundtrack, scored by Richard Rodgers of Rodgers and Hammerstein, is a treat. Glad to see this preserved piece of history has made its way onto DVD!",1427760000,2,385,4.514285714285714
6979824,5,B00SC18CAE,"A fine overview of the 26-episode television series that chronicles World War II through the use of newsreel footage.  Narrated by Alexander Scourby and scored by Richard Rodgers and Robert Russell Bennett, this feature film version was remastered using a recently discovered 16mm dupe print.  The quality of this DVD is excellent.  The black and white images are crisp and the music with narration is remarkably clear considering the source is a 60 year-old 16mm optical soundtrack.  While the feature film itself has been restored, one needs to remember that many of the flaws still visible were on the original newsreels that were used to assemble this documentary.  Some of the scenes are a bit graphic, which is surprising considering this was originally intended for broadcast on NBC in 1953-54.

Since Victory at Sea was created less than 10 years after the actual events, a basic knowledge of World War II history was assumed by the director and editors.",1427673600,6,962,5.018867924528302

8698048,5,B00SC18CAE,"This is the only version narrated by the great Alexander Scourby.  I've looked for this version for years and I finally have one.
Get it and you won't be sorry.",1516147200,,160,4.333333333333333
8698049,5,B00SC18CAE,"The best WWII doc ever....narration in this condensed 2hr version is done beautifully by Alexander Scourby  (a different narrator was used in the individual half hour episodes of the Vic At Sea series).  The music ranges from beautiful to haunting to intense, and flavored with an ethnic feel (Pearl Harbor attack) on occasion, and always fits the mood.  If the viewer knew little or nothing about the War, this is a fantastic, comprehensive overview......and since it was made in the documentary style of the early 1950's, you don't have the annoying ""talking head"" experts appearing every 90sec.",1500940800,,597,5.134020618556701
8698050,5,B00SC18CAE,"An excellent, very condensed version of the highlights of the classic ""Victory at Sea"" TV series!",1500595200,,97,5.125
8698051,5,B00SC18CAE,"Excellent movie based on the award winning 26 episode TV series of 1952.  This uses actual battle films.  As good as the pictures are, the music is great and narration by Alexander Scourby is fabulous. I now have 4 different versions of this timeless classic.

If you have ANY interest in World War ll, I strongly recommend this film.",1489881600,,334,4.627118644067797
8698052,5,B00SC18CAE,Great pieced together film of the TV series.,1475798400,,44,4.625
8698053,2,B00SC18CAE,"The challenge of compressing twenty-six hour long episodes down to one feature length film must have been a daunting one, and I suppose I should not be surprised that it was not really successful.  A single point: the Battle of Midway rated only passing mention in a single sentence voice over of a shot of US ships at sea.  After that what more can I say.  A very brave attempt, but I fear that it will only discourage some who would otherwise expose themselves to the richness of the full series.",1474329600,,498,4.450549450549451
8698054,5,B00SC18CAE,A nice condensed version of the 26 part epic world war two series its says restored i don't know how it can be restored its from old world war two films but i guess this is the best it will ever get.,1459296000,,199,3.761904761904762

8698056,5,B00SC18CAE,"Outstanding condensation of the famed television series.  This version is narrated by Alexander Scourby--one of the greatest narrating voices ever (he was the first to record the entire Bible).  The Richard Rogers music score is another big plus for this item.  A definite ""must have"" for any fan of genre.",1452297600,2,306,5.08
