4287084,4,B004919RHI,Umm well I I don't wanna spoil the ending but.....I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone. Ever....the movie is good but the story is tragic....no one wants to see this....its just plain depressing.,1295481600,2,199,5.0606060606060606
4287085,5,B004919RHI,this movie is one of the best suspense thrillers ive senn. Great movie especially for being 1.5 hours of a dude trapped in a coffin. GREAT STUFF MUST BUY!!!,1295481600,2,156,4.413793103448276
4287086,3,B004919RHI,"So, yeah, Ryan Reynolds can act.  Great job!  But the movie itself is so full of gimmicks and full of set ups just for the sake of making something happen. This story could have been told in a matter of 15 to 30 minutes, but instead was forced into an hour and a half.  The plot felt forced, the bad guys were simply stereotypical, middle eastern bad guys and, oh my god, how many times will no one answer the goddamned phone?  I'm still trying to figure out if the writer of this film is angry about getting the run around on the phone or if he is angry about the war in Iraq.  The premise is interesting but, really, did it have to be an hour and a half?  Did the guy really have to cut of his finger and how many set ups for lighting do we really need?  I am impressed, however, by Ryan Reynold's performance.  If it weren't for him I most likely would not have watched this movie.  Great job casting director!  But all in all, the movie felt too gimmicky and the ending wasn't at all surprising.",1295481600,,999,4.129533678756476
4287087,4,B004919RHI,you know the plot and it's still a great movie because it's a fear we all have. not one of the greatest movies but a thriller that is nail biting especially in the dark. ryan reynolds gave a fantastic performance in this movie and deserves alot of recognition for this role.,1295308800,,274,4.392156862745098
4287088,5,B004919RHI,"An American truck driver working in Iraq finds himself buried alive in a coffin. Armed only with a few items such as a cell phone and a lighter, he is able to communicate with government officials in an attempt to free himself from this predicament. Taking place entirely within the confines of the coffin, this is a riveting tale of claustrophobia and the terror of realizing the possibility of dying alone within a confined space. His fate will not be revealed here, so as not to spoil a film that is exciting until the very end.",1295308800,3,531,4.541666666666667
4287089,5,B004919RHI,"If you can't tell this from reading the previous reviews here, you need to be smart and probably not a republican (smart republican, is that an oxymoron?), to enjoy this movie.  Cerebral and intense.",1295308800,4,199,4.852941176470588
4287090,4,B004919RHI,"After waking up in a small wooden coffin, Paul Conroy (Reynolds) uses everything he has (lighter and cell phone) to find a way out.  The movie opens with no sound or picture for about 30 seconds, then the lighter flicks on and we see Conroy.  That's where the camera stays the entire time.  Except for a short cell phone video Reynolds is the only person we see in the movie.  But much like Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" he is enough to carry it alone and you forget you only see him.  I know what your thinking...how good can a movie be if it only has one person in it the entire time with only a lighter and a cell phone.  The answer is simple.  Fantastic!  This movie feels so real, (the claustrophobia aspect helps) that it is the most tense I've been while watching a movie since I can't remember.  You are right there feeling his frustration and outright anger at the people he calls you want to throw something at the screen.  Not to give anything away, but the ending will leave you breathless.  That also leads to the one downside of the movie.  Like the ""Sixth Sense"" its not one that will have the same effect when watched a second time.  I give it an A.",1295308800,,1159,4.261467889908257
4287091,5,B004919RHI,"This movie takes an idea that you think wouldn't work, work. Don't listen to the haters and watch this under rated masterpiece.",1295136000,5,127,4.818181818181818
4287092,2,B004919RHI,"You know how frustrating it can be when you call the customer service department of various utility companies, retail stores and large corporations, right? Well, someone thought it would be a great idea to make a movie built around that concept but instead of putting the frustrated caller in the comforts of his own living room, they put him inside of a coffin  along with a cell phone and buried him. That pretty much sums up this yawner of a movie.

The number of characters are very limited in this movie and the main character is played by Ryan Reynolds. He is just not a strong enough actor to carry a movie that involves such a small number of characters. I never had the sense that he was actually in any real danger and a better actor could have at least projected this feeling to the viewer.

What makes this movie even worse than the plot is the fact that it is hard to even care about the main character. You can almost imagine many scenarios that would have led him to his predicament and most of them developing from situations he probably created with his own mouth. Oh, you will identify with him only because you will recognize the frustrating telephone scenarios but you will probably identify more with the person on the other end of the line.

Well, at least this film has some good laughs. Too bad that the laughs all have to deal with the coffin obviously growing and shrinking throughout the movie. It appears that the main character can barely move around in the coffin one minute and in the next minute, the coffin looks big enough to play 18 holes of golf inside of it.

This is simply not a good movie. Now, I will place you on hold while you are directed to a movie that is more palatable.",1295049600,10,1717,4.420886075949367
4287093,3,B004919RHI,"Wow, who knew that they made a box big enough to fit Ryan Reynolds AND a whole boatload of liberal talking points?  Oh yeah they are all there: the Iraq war and the military is the pretty obvious one, but go ahead and heap on evil insurance companies, add a dash of health care and even class warfare while you're at it.

Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but the political crap that they heaped on was really pushing it.  And for one character to say, ""they are just like you"", was really detestable.  I'm sorry, but terrorists who would bury someone alive for ransom are not like any Americans I know.  That mentality is disgusting to me.

But, as a suspense thriller, this one really does a great job keeping things fresh and interesting, and Ryan Reynolds can do no wrong.  Pretty much right up till the very end, I felt like the fish on the hook.  They pulled the line and I followed right along the whole way.  I'm always one for a unique movie experience, and this was a good one, I just could have done without a lot of the blatant political statements.",1294099200,10,1067,4.321608040201005

4287095,4,B004919RHI,"What a movie. You've never seen anything like this, I promise you. Throughout the whole film, the emotional intensity gradually increases, peaking at the very end. Thrilling. Ryan Reynolds does an incredible job. I'm amazed how they sucked you into the story, even though the camera never leaves the coffin. I wanted to give it 5 stars because it is so well done, but I just couldn't because it truly made me feel anxious and disturbed. Be careful if you're watching this with kids or if you have severe problems with claustrophobia, this movie might really bother you. Much scarier than your average horror flick, one of the most intense movies I have ever seen.",1510012800,,663,4.773913043478261

I'm incredibly claustrophobic ! One of the reasons I purchased this movie was to see how he dealt with it !  I would be absolutely OUT OF MY MIND if I awakened to a situation like that ! It is so sad and devastating  to think people actually have experienced this type of cruelty in the Middle East and else where. I've heard of a married couple who were buried alive here in the U.S. as well !  This movie never lags ! It keeps you interested to the very end ...and BOY, what an ENDING ! Very Good movie !

More so than Ryan Reynolds' acting, I am was hoping for and amazed that they pulled off ****SPOILER ALERT**** filing the ENTIRE movie from within the coffin, having Mr. Reynolds as the only character (aside from a snake) to appear on screen.

4287119,1,B004919RHI,"SPOILER!!

I really like Reynolds but something was amiss when he agreed to make this horrid thing. The entire film was uncomfortable - and then at the end they just kill him? So you are invested in the character's struggle and suffering and want him to survive and they end the film with him in the box - clearly going to die there? Who makes that kind of story decision?

Awful film.",1490227200,,385,4.333333333333333

4287121,4,B004919RHI,"Spoiler Alert ^^^^^^^^  While you have to suspend disbelief to a degree, I actually was entertained. For a movie in a box, it held my attention, and even made me ""care,"" about the main character. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars, but I dunno how to do that. I think it's a cool late night, don't know what to watch, but want something thrilling meets secluded sorta film. R.R.'s acting was solid, even really good at times. Here is where I have issues... the peripheral characters, and their dialogue were at 80's B movie level meets Grand Theft Auto. However, in a way, that ""fakeness,"" about them sort of enhanced the feeling of being helpless. Bottom line, I was entertained.",1489795200,3,679,4.565573770491803

Yes, it's slow paced. Yes, it's just a man in a box the whole time. Yes, some things just aren't realistic (the lighter, fighting off the snake, etc.). No, I probably won't watch it again until I forget what it was a few years from now.
The story is simple. A man woke up buried alive, and the person who put him there is demanding money. The whole time you're having your own thoughts though. Thinking about how you'd react, what you'd say, what you'd do. It's creepy. It's suspenseful. It makes you angry. It gives you hope. It destroys you! The entire time!

First: if you're in a casket with limited oxygen, using a lighter with consume all of the oxygen, you will pass out and die.
Second: When you are trying to burn your way out, look for an edge not the flat piece of lumbar. There was a nice edge next to the character's head.
Third: This is when I had to turn the movie off. When you do get a hold of the FBI, while buried alive and, they ask you for your social security number, you wouldn't ask ""Why? I'm an American citizen"", you would give it to them.",1483920000,,560,4.480392156862745

His battery is low on his phone, but he uses it for a light. It's Dark half the time and no real lines, he's in a box! That's it! You presume he dies.

This movie could have easily been trimmed down to an hour or less, but I guess the director wanted to keep us buried longer.  I sat through the entire movie hoping this wasn't going to be another movie with no ending.

As others have said, you feel like you're trapped in the coffin with Ryan.  It would have been nice if they showed something other than the inside of that coffin.  What about his wife and son or somebody walking above ground ignoring a faint cry, or the actual ambush that supposedly happened. I felt like this is another movie with something missing.

What I don't understand is why so many actors in this film when only one or two were shown in a cell phone video.  I must have blinked and missed them.  There is also no indication of time.

The ending leaves you speechless and the entire movie has you hooked.

Seriously and honestly; I was prepared to to click 10 seconds ahead (love that re-wind feature-have never used to 10 sec. forward one)
I was prepared to do it a whole bunch of times people.....I mean 90 minutes in a box with this premise?  I think by 15 minutes into the movie I relaxed my grip on the mouse and started breathing and started thinking about breathing and kept watching.

The best jump-scare movies of all time have never taken my breath away and never as slowly and effectively as did this film. More precisely, this performance by this actor took it away. It's only because so many other people affect the outcome of any production I just can't reward them with a 5th star only because...

Not surprising that in all the reviews I've read either praising or vilifying Buried, no one made direct reference to the writer Chris Sparling, who launched his career on the premise of the ""contained thriller,"" that is, a film taking place in a small, contained setting (See also ATM, another contained thriller with Sparling's tragic stamp on it).  He wrote Buried in a Starbucks in Providence, Rhode Island, intending to shoot the picture himself, but his agent instead got director Rodrigo Cortes attached--and landed a bigger budget.  Anyway, the message here is just a reminder that it all starts with the writer.  This was Sparling's script from his own concept.  He takes all the credit and all the blame for making it take place entirely in a box!

My only complaint about Buried is the musical score.  For being a movie in a tiny box, that orchestral score is pretty heavy-handed, and the emotional cues are a bit obvious.  I can imagine Buried without any music at all, but then I suppose that would have earned it even more 1-star reviews.",1445385600,,1123,4.747422680412371

Sometimes things don't go the way you want, in the case of Paul Conroy he wakes up buried alive. It's one of the most extremely uncomfortable situations I could ever imagine being in and I would expect a film tackling the subject matter to be equally uncomfortable. This film manages to do that; it does it with cinematography and with storytelling - including the ending!

I see many negative reviews saying they didn't like the ending, well if a filmmaker wants to challenge the viewer, I appreciate that the filmmaker can keep that challenge throughout the entire film and not succumb to presenting an ending we may want. Paul didn't want to be buried alive, but he was. Viewers may have wanted a different ending, but that's what they got. Maybe the horrible feeling the negative reviews have aid precisely the negative feeling the filmmakers wanted you to have.

Come on, if you're at all interested in watching a feature length film about someone buried alive, surely you must already have some expectation of being challenged as a viewer. Surely you must expect the film to tell it's story differently than most others. Escpecialyl if you've seen the trailer. And as any film fan I would hope you would want something that was different and not more of the same. Who wants to find themselves bored and anticipating every plot point?

4287409,4,B004919RHI,"SYNOPSIS--
BURIED (Spain/USA/France-2010) is the sad and frightening story of Paul Conroy, a truck driver sent to Iraq by his contractor employer to help with that country's rebuilding. After a group of Iraqis kill some of his friends, Paul is captured and knocked unconscious. He awakens in a totally dark place, fumbles around and finds his lighter, an old-fashioned metal one. Paul soon realizes he's been imprisoned in a wooden box, and since its walls can't be budged, he must be buried alive! Rage and panic quickly set in.

An Iraqi calls, issues a 9 PM deadline for his release upon receipt of a $5 million ransom. Paul begs to be freed from his tomb right now but is refused. His captors have supplied him with two glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, the cellphone, and a pen kife. On him he's got a small flask of alcohol and a bottle of anti-anxiety pills. Both soon come in handy.

The cellphone's battery is at half-power. Somehow in the next two hours he must negotiate with the terrorist who keeps calling and demanding money, plus reach the U.S. State Dept., his wife, his elderly mom and a local hostage negotiator. Time, air, battery and hope steadily run out.

As things become desperate, the captor's demands get more bizarre. A phone call from the company he works for is the final insult. When bombs explode aboveground, Paul's coffin springs a leak. Will help arrive before he chokes to death on the sand that's filling his small space?

The only hokey part is when a hissing snake finds its way into the rough-hewn packing case. Other than that, Ryan Reynolds does a magnificent job of carrying this film alone, with the help of voices on a cellphone.

4287416,5,B004919RHI,"Paul Conroy is not a happy man. He has just woken up, bloodied, disoriented, and with a bad headache. And to cap it off  hes been buried alive in a coffin. Now thats a really bad start to the week.

Of course a cynic could reply that thats what you get for driving a truck for occupying forces in Iraq. And theres some truth in that. On the other hand, one can hardly blame Conroy for being sucked in for working for a firm that is so heartless and amoral it would make Satan blush. Regardless, this is not the time for doling out blame. Conroy has a cell phone to talk with his kidnappers and the outside world, a lighter, and only enough air to last the length of the film, the entirety of which is filmed inside the coffin.

It is no small thing to film a powerful one and a half hour suspense solely with one actor in a coffin. (Well in one sense it is a small thing but  you know what I mean.) Rodrigo Cortes does an outstanding job of directing and Ryan Reynolds does a bang on job playing the only character in the whole dang movie (save those ghostly voices that float in with the cellphone, tantalizingly close and yet agonizingly far). This is one of the boldest, most original films Ive seen in years.

As I sit and reflect on the experience I surmise that the most effective part of Buried is that it plays off our worst fears. The horror of being buried alive lies deep in our psyche (think of Edgar Allen Poes haunting short story The Cask of Amontillado). But the existential grip of this film doesnt stop there. The possibility of being buried alive, if terrifying, remains remote. The more horrifying recognition comes when we see that coffin as a metaphor for our very mortality. Whether we like it or not, each one of us is Paul Conroy, slowly waking up to our own inevitable demise and like him, desperately calling on the phone for somebody  anybody  who can help us.

4287423,2,B004919RHI,"A bold move, making a movie set entirely inside a coffin.. full of innovative ideas to keep the action as fresh as possible, with an involving performance from Ryan Reynolds.. however, all that effort just doesn't quite get over the fact that this is a movie - set in a box.
We open the movie with Ryan Reynolds waking up in the titular state, and becoming aware of his surroundings.  As he calls on his phone for help and tries to contact his family, we learn how it happened, and Reynolds convincingly portrays the different stages of emotion one might expect to feel under such circumstances.  A multitude of camera angles, a surprising variety of lighting and varying tones as his conversations switch from his potential rescuer to his family to the perpetrator, do their best to keep involvement at its peak.  In the end though, it ultimately seems a somewhat shallow affair  - it is clever and intelligent enough to be thought provoking, but the premise limited enough that the thoughts provoked don't go far.
Plaudits to all concerned, not least Reynolds for holding his own throughout the movie, and to the imagination of cinematographer and director - I love to see movies that experiment like this being made.. but it doesn't stop me finding in the end that this particular experiment didn't quite cut it.",1372723200,,1315,4.779735682819383
4287424,5,B004919RHI,"First let me begin by saying that I rented this movie from a local video store (But I do plan on buying it off Amazon in the near future), which is why there is no confirmed purchase for my review.  Now moving along-

 Setting: It seems that a lot of reviewers are immediately jumping on the point that the movie has one setting, a small and dark coffin.  For some reason people are saying that this detracts from the experience or that it was cheap of the producers and directors to do such a thing.  I completely disagree.  The fact that this movie has one setting only intensifies the experience that you get from seeing a scared man trapped underground.  It increases your ability to emphasize by showing you no other settings, in a sense, trapping you along with him.  Some movie-makers are not capable of pulling such a stunt, but Director Rodrigo Corts has proved that he is able to do such a feat.  This film does more with one small setting, than thousands of other films have done that have dozens of settings.

 Camera and Lighting: As far as the camera angles go, I thought that they were rather impressive at conveying the cramped quarters that Paul is stuck in, without being obnoxious or tough to look at.  The lighting effects are also superbly implemented, and the film is pitch black when it needs to be, and has accurate lighting details from either Paul's zippo, glowstick, or flashlight throughout the movie.

 Story: I felt like I was on the edge of my seat the entire time the movie was rolling, as Ryan Reynolds pushes the plot along with his perfect rendition of desperation, terror, and frustration.  Throughout the movie he uses his only tool of outside help, the cellphone his kidnappers left him, to try and contact somebody on the outside who could help him.  This really makes you think about who you would call if you were in a situation like this, as most people are not able to do anything for him, as he is in Iraq.  People even have the nerve to put him on hold or ask him stupid questions when he is pleading for them to save his life.  He eventually gets through to Dan Brenner (voiced by Robert Paterson, who does an excellent job), who handles hostage situations in Iraq.  Throughout the film, you have to wonder how much Dan really cares about Paul, especially when it concerns politics (Dan and others frequently tell him not to call any news outlets as it would cause an international incident).  The end of the movie is the most satisfying aspect, and I think the ending was carried out marvelously.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough.",1370995200,,2588,4.558441558441558

4287426,4,B004919RHI,"Personally I think this film should by all rights go down in history as something of a minor classic for numerous obvious reasons. I mean, who ever considered that a movie that takes place entirely inside a wooden coffin could be so completely nail biting and truly entertaining? How on earth did the writer and director come up with this let alone put faith in the idea that it could work as a full length feature film? Indeed they must have figured this idea would be a major gamble, but their effort pays off here more than anyone could have expected. Ryan Reynolds, whom I have never heard of gives an ecxcellet performance as a man burried alive in this wooden box who must challenge his will to live and find a way to survive something thay seems impossible to survive. Hes subjected to a lot of mental torment in the process too. Hes buried with only a couple of cell phones, some light sticks, a flashlight and a zippo lighter. As he makes phone call after phone call he pleads with anyone who will listen as he runs out of time to help find and rescue him as he runs out of air and as sand spills in through cracks in the coffin hes been laid to rest in. He may have a chance however because he soon discovers that hes been placed there for ransom and if he does what his captors demand he may have a chance. If he can keep his cell phone battery alive long enough maybe the officials who are trying to find him can track his cellphone signal to where hes burried before its too late. Between Reynolds stellar performance,and Rodrigo Cortss slick direction that makes this story tense and suspensful, this film comes off as a real creepy ride. I got this on Bluray and I am happy I did, because though its very hard to imagine how a film that takes place entirely in a wooden box could ever be all that interesting, but its famtastic and intense all the way through and truly original too.

4287452,3,B004919RHI,"As you can tell from the vastly disparate customer reviews, this movie is very polarizing. As a Libra, I'm comfortable taking the middle position. There are some really good and really bad dimensions. Depending upon what you expect or prefer to watch, you will either hate or love it.

THE GOOD
The acting by the lead character was very good.

Also, the voice actors --- WITH ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION -- were good as well.

The movie was quite suspenseful. You won't be able to stop watching.

The production value was pretty good. You will believe you're in a coffin with the character.

THE BAD
The movie contained too many political and moralizing dimensions. I did not want nor did I expect these. They really undermined the entertainment value of the film.

Some of the political statements were so contrived. For example, there is a recorded conversation in the middle of the film. Listen for ""do we have permission to record this call."" That moment was an example of the film's excessive moralistic political commentary.

The movie should have been marketed differently. It is extremely dark. It is also more of a social and political commentary -- rather than a ""thriller.""

The ending will disappoint many viewers. I can't say anymore on this subject, but many people will not like it.

There is an ""accented"" voice in the film of a character who had some role in placing the lead character in the coffin. The voice does not represent the accent of the region. This is a major flaw because it is a prominent part of the film.

Some aspects of the movie lacked credibility and felt contrived (see above).

4287459,2,B004919RHI,"An American contractor working in Iraq wakes up bound and gagged and in a pine box - buried alive.  He has a cell phone a lighter, a pencil, a very small flask of alcohol, his anxiety pills, a knife, a flashlight and 2 glow lights (the kind you bend).  His captors are demanding he make a video or pay a ransom of $5 million.

The people he is able to make contact with - via the phone - are useless jerks and it's annoying.  The filming is ENTIRELY all in the pine box - you never see anyone else worrying about him or trying desperately to race against the clock to find/save this guy.  Nobody seems to care about him - and guess what - it's kind of hard for you to care about him too.  He's just a guy in a movie.

More than halfway thru the movie an asp? travels down his pant leg and finally exits thru a crack in the pine box.  Had it happened earlier in the movie you might have accepted it, but up until that point he'd done a LOT of moving around and would've noticed it shortly after waking up, or noticed it going into his pants in the first place - so it was really stupid how they put that in there.

And while he's dying in the box, the company he was working for when he was abducted, phones and records the conversation for legal purposes telling him he was terminated for cause the day before and his family will thereby not be entitled to insurance benefits from his demise.

Overall, the film lacks suspense through most of it even though you understand he's in a dire situation. I walked away feeling this was a complete waste of time and on top of that it made me cranky.  I would NOT recommend this movie.",1346976000,2,1627,4.149681528662421

4287464,4,B004919RHI,"I've heard too many complaints that this movie is ""just a guy in a box"". It's alot more than that.

Ryan Reynolds plays truck driver Paul Conroy, who goes to post-invasion Iraq as a contract worker. The opening scene is total darkness. He lights his lighter and discovers he's in a closed wooden box, little larger than a coffin. It is made clear that he has no idea where he is or how he got there. He discovers a cellular telephone, and the story is off to his quest of finding out about his situation and how to get someone to find him and dig him out.

I'm not going to give away the suspenseful plot turns; I will just cut right to the ending, which I found somewhat unsatisfactory. So if you don't want to know how the movie ends, quit reading here.

In the end, Paul's box fills with sand and he suffocates. The part I found unsatisfactory was that he could have made a last-ditch attempt to get himself out since -- this is important -- it is apparent from his conversations on the cell phone that he's only buried about 3 feet under. If he could have gathered his feet under himself, or even just his knees, he just might have wriggled his way out (important: the panels of the box's top were broken from the weight of the sand, that's how the box was filling in). I know that may sound unlikely, but Paul is a young, strong man, he's fighting for his very life, and it's just sand, not packed earth. Anyway, he didn't even try, which made for a disappointing ending.

One way many have described the movie is that it's just a guy in a box talking on a cell phone for 90 minutes before he finally dies. Well, I'm not going into details, but his effort to get somebody on that telephone who can help him made for quite an interesting story. Four stars.",1346284800,,1760,4.276276276276277

4287470,4,B004919RHI,"This is 90 minutes of Ryan Renolds trapped in a box for the entire movie. You should know that going in. Ryan Renolds wakes up trapped in a box. He was a truck driver in Iraq and in hostile territory before his convoy was killed. This is all said in the movie not shown, because again, this is Ryan Renolds trapped in a box. His co stars are a cell phone and a lighter. With the cell phone he calls loved ones and other people that can help. He runs the full gambit of emotions from anger to sadness, love to loss. At least you hear the voices over the phone, which gets some interesting conversations.

Buried is really a tour de force of one man's acting talent. He does an admiral job of convincing you that he will die if he doesn't get help.  His acting pulls you in. You are there with him in the cluster phobic confined area. It builds drama and tension to the climax of the movie.

Unfortunately that's all that can be said about this movie. It is not everyone's cup of tea. There are no flashbacks. There is no big budget beyond a casket box and a cell phone.

4287472,3,B004919RHI,"Paul Conroy, a private contractor, working as a truck driver in Iraq, wakes up after an ambush to discover he is inside a wooden coffin buried beneath the desert sand. He has nothing but a lighter, a flask with whiskey, some pills and a cell phone provided to him by his captors. He begins to make desperate calls for help as time drags on and his situation becomes more and more dire.

This is the premise (and a large portion of the plot) of BURIED, an independent film from Spain, starring Ryan Reynolds in what is essentially a one-man show. It's a tense little thriller that is nearly spoiled by some serious flaws. Reynolds gives a fairly convincing performance as a fairly ordinary guy who begins his ordeal in a panic and only gradually finds his way to calm. At least, he's calm for awhile.

The movie is mostly the various conversations he has with the outside world. Grappling with lost signals (and a dying battery), answering machines and a disbelieving bureaucracy. He can't reach his loved ones. He can't convince his captors that he doesn't have $5 million dollars to exchange for his freedom. There's really nothing he can do about his situation...he has no way to break free and must rely entirely on a world of people who aren't quite as motivated as he is.

Director Rodrigo Cortes does a good job of finding as many ways of filming the events of the films as he can. His camera swoops around inside the coffin, yet we always have the claustrophobic feeling. The film has a simple premise (sort of in the way that OPEN WATER was a simple, claustrophobic little film), but Cortes and company grab all they can out of it.

However, even though we can believe that Conroy would frequently panic and make some bad decisions...he makes too many bad choices. When he does reach people on the phone, he does an unbelievably bad job of convincing them that he really needs their help. I can believe him losing his cool once or twice...but he does it fairly consistently. And when he finally DOES reach someone who might be willing to help, he spends a lot of time sharing unneeded information. He knows his battery is running down, yet he often wastes his breath. It got to the point where I occasionally thought, ""Well, if he dies, he has no one to blame but himself."" (Notwithstanding that he didn't put himself in the coffin.)

Worst of all, though...the film manages to take some pretty nasty jabs at the mission in Iraq and make some attempts at moral relativism. One of the folks working to help Conroy, a hostage expert in Iraq, actually tries to explain away the terrorist acts as the work of people who will simply do anything to survive. ""You'd do the same if you were in their situation, Paul,"" this awful man says. REALLY??? If a time comes when the only way I can think to feed my family is to kidnap folks and bury them alive...go ahead and shoot me. To dare suggest that Americans would be just as bad as these terrorist extremists is a mighty big (and offensive) argument for a little thriller to make. For unsubtle, unearned and unsubstantiated political/social statements inserting themselves where they don't belong, BURIED takes the cake.

The day after seeing the film, what I remember most is not the tension and excitement and fear...but the bad taste in my mouth from the group of Spanish filmmakers and producers who took pot shots at America.

I mention all this, because the film is generally very effective (though not as tense as some other reviews I've read have implied). If you don't mind the politics I mention, by all means enjoy the film. If you find the premise intriguing enough that you think you need to overlook the politics...then you'll have a good time.

This film is like a showcase for Ryan Reynolds' acting abilities. He is the only visible actor in the film and is constantly on camera. It was impressive. You aren't just watching a movie, you're praying and hoping that someone comes to save him. It's important to make the audience care about a character and this one does.

This movie is the definition of claustrophobic, as the entire movie is set inside the aforementioned box. You keep waiting for a flashback scene, a dream sequence, or some other cut-scene that will take you out of the tight confines of the box, but you never get it. Much as the lead character is trapped in the box and is growing increasingly uncomfortable and anxious, the viewers are trapped inside with him and also growing increasinly uncomfortable watching the movie. Was this the intention of the director? Possibly so. Probably so. My wife, at one point, had to get up to leave the room, as she said she was feeling trapped and just wanted to get out of the room for a bit. Like I said - this movie is the definition of claustrophobic.

The movie could have been more enjoyable for me if the ending had not turned out as it did. For me, the ending just killed the movie and I can't recommend it.

4287480,4,B004919RHI,"The concept of putting a man in a coffin for the entire length of a film probably sounded insane when it was first pitched, but viewing the finished product, one can't help but admire the brilliance of the writing, and the execution of the screenplay by director Rodrigo Cortes.

Ryan Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, a truck driver overseas in Iraq.  His convoy is attacked, and he wakes up buried in a coffin.  Using his lighter for illumination, Conroy is able to see where he is, and is immediately filled with panic, but he finds that he is helplessly trapped.  He discovers there is a cell phone in the coffin, a device that becomes his lifeline to the outside world, and the device that facilitates much of what happens in the film.

The writing is quite creative, taking a simple static situation and transforming it into a dynamic and dramatic one, mainly through a series of phone conversations, and a few text messages and videos.  On the screen for almost the entire film, Ryan Reynolds' performance is riveting, and nearly totally convincing, as his character learns that he is being held for ransom by some unknown terrorists.

In a maddening series of phone calls, Conroy leaves messages for his wife, his employer CRT, and finally manages to contact a government agency that might be able to help.  Dan Brenner (Robert Paterson) of the Hostage Working Group is very familiar with hostage and ransom situations in Iraq, and offers a faint hope of rescue.  Conroy's captors, whoever they may be, are very experienced at the hostage game, as besides the cell phone, they have provided various articles for him to use, like glow sticks, a flashlight, a knife, and a flask of liquor.  As the ordeal goes on, these articles come into play and are used in various ways.

There doesn't appear to be a breathing tube into coffin, so why Paul doesn't suffocate is something that you have to ignore.  Conroy receives a visitor in the form of a small snake, who slithers into the coffin through a hole in the side.  It's completely outrageous, but still electrifying, as death appears to be literally at Paul's feet, until finds a way to convince the serpent to leave.  The action is very much in the moment.  There are no flashbacks or fantasy scenes.  The only time another actor is even seen, is through videos on Conroy's phone.  Even so, the sudden death of a coworker still has all the impact of a blow to the gut.

Conroy is intelligent, resourceful, and someone you indentify with and feel sympathy for, as he endures indifference, frustration, and soul crushing heartbreak.  The writing is excellent.  It's quite remarkable how dramatic the phone conversations are just watching Conroy's side of the conversation, and Ryan Reynolds' performance while lying in a darkened confined space, is just amazing.

Dan Brenner's voice comes to represent Conroy's primary lifeline.  Unfortunately, although efforts are apparently made, the Government has difficulty locating him.  With the world literally closing in to engulf him, Paul Conroy is a man who is truly screwed.  You truly feel his anger and agony, when his caring employer calls back with some interesting news.  When artillery fire rocks the ground, rattling Paul's teeth, and nearly causing the coffin to collapse, the terrorists who put him in the ground are feared dead.  But there are still a few more surprises ahead for Paul Conroy.

Shot in Spain, director Rodrigo Cortes' effort may not be uplifting, but it will probably generate some strong emotions.  Buried is a film that draws you into its world very close, making it more of an experience than most movies.  Although mostly on his back, Ryan Reynolds delivers a tour de force performance, while somehow managing to preserve his personal sanity making the film.

Mostly shot in minimal or poor light, getting the Bluray edition probably isn't a priority, although the Bluray/DVD combo pack can often be found for a reasonable price used.  The Bluray edition does contains a featurette that covers some of the behind the scenes goings on, and things like how different versions of the coffin were used in shooting the various scenes in the film.",1319846400,2,4169,4.879261363636363

It's not simplistic at all; won the New York Critics' Circle award for Best Screenplay. Not much to say without blabbing away all the clever jabs at life, as it might be. As a film, it's certainly a revelation; as satire, it's brilliant, and as entertainment, I can only say that Ryan Reynolds is endearing and makes me care about his fate.

Well I stayed with it to the end and wow what a film. The dvd case says things like 'Thrilling', etc., but I was not impressed... at first. There is a critical point in the film (the twist)where you find out what is going on and then it hits you. It is from that point that I could relate to it. Now I've never been in a box before against my will but the symbolism here is what we can all relate to.... and who hasn't been done this way by someone before? You think everything is good and then you find out what the real deal is.

Points:
(1) Movie is within the confines of what looks like a coffin but is more like a large box of some kind

4287484,3,B004919RHI,"I appreciate the risks that ""Buried"" took. Put your star in a box, self-lit with only a lighter, glow sticks, occasionally a flashlight and the screen of a phone. And stay there.

I think most movies would intercut the box-time with scenes from the search team, or the empty house of the family that star Ryan Reynolds keeps trying to call, or the ridiculously bureaucratic office that put the character in Iraq in the first place, but not this movie.  Reynolds is literally the face of this movie and he does a brilliant job. And I have to give a lot of credit to all the voice actors, including Robert Paterson and occasional ""Glee"" alum Stephen Tobolowsky, who manage to have just as much presence as Reynolds, despite being merely voices on the other end of the phone.

""Buried"" also takes risks with the story, offering up several moments I would not have expected.

So I can appreciate what went into it. The acting is superb. The cinematography I think makes some odd choices that don't always work, but at the end it's still a movie filmed in a box, so I think there's some leeway on weird shots. The story is daring.  But there are also some downsides.

For all the heart and all the emotion and the gravity of the latter half the film, the first half actually strays into being kind of boring, and more than a little irritating to watch as buried Reynolds wave a lighter around his box -- especially when he's whipping it out to better see his cell phone, which, you know, is kind of bright all on its own.  I was streaming this, and in the first half, I nearly turned it off a few times but instead just opened a new window and did other things until the movie started to sound interesting again.

I mean, clearly it not only GOT interesting but got really good. I just don't think great movies should ever make me want to do other things out of boredom.

In short, this is a very dense movie for only being 95 minutes, and if that's your thing, you might enjoy it. But it's not a popcorn flick. If you just want something to watch while kicking back to relax on a Saturday afternoon, you probably want to look for something else.",1317513600,2,2141,4.4
4287485,5,B004919RHI,"I have been in love with Ryan Reynolds since I saw him and his abs in the remake of ""The Amityville Horror"". I came across this film a few weeks ago on cable TV and immediately went out and bought the Blu-ray disc. The movie deals with a young truck driver working in Iraq who wakes up to find himself buried alive in a wooden coffin. The only thing that keeps him alive is a cell phone and a lighter and it's up to him to try to get out of this terrible hell he has found himself in.

 What makes ""Buried"" so good is how suspenseful it is. The viewer asks the question, ""Will this guy get out or will he die here?"". For the entire 90 minutes of this movie you will be on the edge of your seat biting your nails hoping against hope this man is saved.

 Ryan Reynolds is also the only person to appear on film during its duration. There are voice actors used when his character is talking to them via his cell, but Reynolds carries the movie and I might add superbly.

 ""Buried"" was made in Spain which explains why I didn't hear about the movie until recently. It has had many showings at independent film festivals around the world, but has never seen a major U.S. release.

So begins this movie that is essentially telling the story of Conroy being held hostage for a hefty ransom while waging a battle against time to be rescued and dealing with increasingly irrational captors.
Given that Reynolds is the only actor that the audience sees during the film and that his stage is his cramped coffin/wood box, he manages to do a great job as the anxiety filled captive struggling to be rescued. And herein lies my problem. This movie is a nightmare for anyone who is claustrophobic. Reynolds did such a great job adapting to his film environment that I had a problem not feeling confined.
The script was clever and not completely predictable. At one point while Reynolds is in a frenzy to be located (remember he has no idea of exactly where he is because he didn't come to until he was already buried) the company he contracted with goes through a protracted process of firing him over his ebbing phone signal so they won't bear any responsibility regarding his kidnapping.

Is it a thriller? Sure, it has plenty of suspense.

Is it a war movie? Sure, in the sense that it is a story in Iraq and involving war action, though there are no soldiers in it. The sole actor is a truck driver employed by a contractor. The supporting actress is a colleague of his.
Is it an anti-war movie? Sort of. The conversations between the hero and his captor, and also with his outside contacts have a touch of criticism of the Iraq invasion. The hero certainly doesn't know why he is there, apart from the need for a job.

It is strongly anti-corporate. The villain of the piece is not just the captor/extortionist/terrorist, who is given some consideration of justification, but mainly the man's employer, the private contractor for services in the war zone.
The phone `interview' that the head of personnel does, on tape, from the US HQ, with the employee trapped in a box under ground in Iraq, is among the most cruel and sadistic scenes about corporate life that I have ever seen. Or make that `listened to'.

4287493,3,B004919RHI,"CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!

Well, I thought this movie was just going to be boring because it's just 1 man in a box buried underneath ground. But, there were good parts in the movie and has an interesting story. I thought the movie was okay at the end.

Paul is the main character and only character in the movie. lol Everybody else is talking to him by cellphone. I think Paul is just 3 or 4 feet underground but not 6 feet which has been stated on the slip cover. I think it's like that because 6 feet underground sounds better than 3 or 4 feet. There is actually some action in the movie which is hard to believe. Most of the action is him trying to turn his whole body around from one side to the other side of the box. That's pretty hard to do, if you think about it. There is not much room to move about and turning; Paul does hurts himself doing it. In the movie, Paul did this, when there was a snake with him in the box. The snake came in through a small hole. Paul at one end of the box starts a fire and forces the snake out, and then he quickly turns his body around to stop the fire from burning.

I think the the story is pretty good. Paul does everything he can to save his life and protect his family by using everything he has with him, when he is buried underground. I think the movie shows how little and have much a person can do with a cellphone now a days. Make videos, send messages, and talk even with little reception all in the same device. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was that Paul had to cut off his finger. I think he didn't really needed to do that, but it was in the movie. I think they made Paul cut off his finger because it shows what a man will do to protect his family. But, if you think about it long enough there was no need for him to do that. The situation was if he didn't cut off his finger, the terrorists will go and kill his family. The way they build up the situation about the terrorists and how poor and what they want is really money, then it doesn't make sense. They logically cannot get over to America to kill his family. How are they supposedly find a way to enter the country? They have no money! All they know is Paul home address. Paul says they have his driver license and looked at a map. That's all they can do. Even if they find the money to enter the country, the U.S government will not even let people from Iraq go to Michigan without setting off a bunch of red flags. The U.S. government are while aware of Paul and where is from. Letting people from Iraq go to Michigan doesn't make sense. Finally, the terrorists don't even know what his wife or kid looks like. They probably would be long gone by the time the terrorists come here and that's if they get to enter at all. Yup. A snow ball's chance these terrorists could ever think about getting close to the U.S., let alone Michigan. Paul's finger could had been saved!

I don't know what to make of the ending when they didn't find Paul but someone else. It would seem like there is a chance that Paul would be saved. But doing that would cause the movie to go longer then it needs to. Also, it will have to explain more things about the situation. If they don't explain things, then a lot of unanswered questions will come up and that will make it a worse movie. So, instead, they end up finding Mark White, which was another person talked about in the movie. Mark White was supposedly was saved already, when he was in Paul's situation. That was a lie of course. At the end of the movie, this tells me that Mark White was found died and so Paul will die too.

If this was a more happy ending movie, than Paul would not have lost his finger and would be saved and the terrorists would had died. But no, it wasn't like that. I say it's wasn't my tastes for an ending because I don't like those endings. I like happy ones, so I would have to give it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1308787200,,3901,4.107470511140236

4287497,1,B004919RHI,"This was compared to Hitchcock by more than a few people at the time of its release. Alfred Hitchcock. Master of suspense.

Ryan Reynolds is in a box. That's the whole movie. In fact, it's technically a spoiler, I suppose. He's in a box and he's Ryan Reynolds (which is to say, he effectively plays himself). What about that qualifies as psychological thriller, exactly? Is there anything about Ryan Reynolds' psychology that you didn't pick up fifteen years ago by watching half an episode of ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place""? Was there anything about that experience that made you feel that watching him lay in a box for 90 minutes would be ""thrilling""? If not, then you will not find this to be a psychological thriller.

Don't worry, there's a subplot. It's a scathing critique of the failures of automated telephone systems. I swear to God... that's the subplot.

Oh, and there's a theme, too. Something about corruption of modern government and corporate interests blah, blah, blah. I guess some people like movies that carry a big political message for no apparent reason. Some people like ""Lone Wolf McQuade"". Some people have bad taste.

And it's those people, the ones who have bad taste, who are the target with the title of my review. I take no issue with Rodrigo Cortes, the director of this dud. I believe in free art and welcome anyone who wants to make a movie, irrespective of what quality of film they make.

Critics, however, which is to say anyone who offered an opinion on this bad boy, should generally just feel ashamed of themselves. Comparisons got made to Hitchcock, and those people are out of their mind. And anyone who heard those comparisons and didn't make sure to redact them are accomplices to insanity. This isn't similar to Alfred Hitchcock. At all. Hitchcock was first and foremost a master of cinematography. This movie takes place in a damn box. There isn't any cinematography. Hitchcock was also a crafter of wild characters, men so outside of our narrow archetypal view of characters that the juxtaposition of the two often taught us something about human behavior. What does Ryan Reynolds teach us, exactly? Don't date Alanis Morisette? I already knew that.

My point is just that making such a weak comparison is bad criticism. Critics, good critics, can act as guardians of history in a way. They help us as a culture retain a high standard for greatness, because they appreciate what was great in that which was, and take time to understand why it was great. Without this, culture would be forced to reset every five years. If all you can remember about Hitchcock films are that they were sort of creepy and often based on semi-universal human fears (the only two analogies that can be drawn between ""Buried"" and anything Hitchcock ever did) then go watch them again.

This one takes it a step further, moving from a group of actors to a single actor, and eliminating any lead up time to 'the spot' - it starts off right at that moment and continues there until the end. One location, one actor on screen.

I thought it was interesting throughout - quite a few unbelievable moments that will have you saying ""Come on, really?"", but still enjoyable. I didn't care for titles like Frozen, partly because of the unrealistic moments, but even with it's share I still enjoyed Buried. Haven't really seen a movie like it before, but it's not a fantastic must-see movie.

Acting was good from almost everyone - Ryan Reynolds was very good, some of the people on the phone were trying a bit too hard, but nothing 'bad'.

VIDEO QUALITY: A lot of people seem to say ""It's really good.. for a movie filmed inside a dark box!"" which didn't really mean much to me. Does that mean it's ""OK"" looking, or ""GREAT"" looking, not counting the fact it was filmed in a box. After seeing it, I'd have to say ""It's really good.. for a movie filmed inside a dark box!"" ;)
Actually, a lot of it will depend on your TV - I had mine calibrated but the ""Black Levels"" set to Light - this worked great in most movies, but was very distracting in this one. You could see the color temperature shifts from post-production (the black would turn a shade of orange or blue, depending which way that scene went), you could also see the artificial brightening in areas such as Ryan's face. It wasn't until I set my TV to ""Black Levels -- Dark"" that it actually looked good, and it looked great! Blacks were very dark, colors were nice, loads of sharpness and some (non-distracting) grain.

AUDIO QUALITY: was fantastic - for being in a box, theres a lot of surround sound usage between the actor and the music (which was excellent and pretty creepy).

EXTRAS: A short featurette - nothing great, but interesting. The most distracting thing is that it's in Standard Definition, filmed in what appears to be non-anamorphic letterbox (so on an HDTV, you get bars on the top, bottom, left and right) - For a 2011 Blu-Ray, this shouldn't be happening.

It was intense. Reynolds does an absolutely superb acting job in this one-man show and Director Corts keeps what you might preconceive as a boring movie an anxiety filled roller coaster ride.

So why only 3 stars, you ask? Well, as effective as the movie was, let's just say I couldn't wait to get out of the box. With a running time of just over 90 minutes, I'd normally say that's a pretty good amount of time to spend with a movie...not too long and not too short. But in this instance it was too much of the same thing for too long. Man in the box. Cell phone. Lighter. Glowstick. And of course extreme desperation as the walls start closing in literally and figuratively.

I find myself saying this about a lot of movies lately, but Buried would have been an ideal episode of HBO's now defunct&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Crypt/dp/B0030E5PYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Crypt</a>. The episodes in Tales were 30 minutes apiece and at that length Buried might have been one of the most memorable episodes in Tales history. But alas, Tales has been off the air for years now so there really is no short form format for directors to present their stories (not that Corts would have chosen a short form format even if it was available). So after 45 minute of Buried, I started watching the Blu Ray disk at 1.5x speed...a pretty cool function of my Blu Ray player that keeps everything pretty normal except it's like everyone just talks really really fast. And there were even a few parts where I sped up the fast forward to 30x because it just got to the point of, ""alright; I get it; man in the box; let's go; does he get out or not?""

So would I recommend Buried? Yes, but it was one of the toughest movies to rate in a while. It was too long (2 stars). The acting/directing were excellent (4 stars). The story concept? Pretty dog-gone creepy, current and realistic (3 and a half stars).",1304121600,11,2664,4.913333333333333

The Hollywood left has apparently ceased believing that allegorical screeds have to be entertaining to the masses.  This plodding, monotonous fable makes its message clangingly clear:  capitalism is uncannily evil; the U.S. military is diabolical; Westerners are greedy, vulgar, and weak; Middle-Eastern terrorists are simply poverty-stricken people driven to desperation.  And the West will collapse, buried by the symbolic sands of the third world.
Worst of all, this film's creators imagine its audience to be so obtuse that its one character is scripted to scream out every dawning revelation that his own wicked employer and incompetent government care not a whit for him and would rather see him die than risk lawsuits and bad publicity.  The presentation of the amorality of these institutions is, in fact, so over-the-top that it totters on the rim of surrealism.
Trapped in a primitive wooden box but totally dependent on modern technology, the protagonist utilizes a cell phone, flashlight, glow stick, and lighter.  But does he investigate a snake's burrow that likely leads to the surface or attempt to use a broken board to dig through a presumed three feet of loose, sifting sand?  Alas, there's no American ingenuity in this first-world everyman, who merely downs liquor and nerve pills and waits lamb-like for rescue.  He's metaphorically unmanned by an Arabian snake down his pants and his compliance in cutting off his own digit.  He haplessly shouts obscenities at helpful-minded females on the phone and even seeks hollow solace from his senile mother.  In his tomb-to-be, he embodies the liberal vision of Western society's doom.",1303776000,4,1669,5.315589353612167

The film takes place real time and we spend the entire film in this coffin, which is both unsettling and depressing.

He is held to ransom and has to fight his fears, bureaucratic telephone personnel and his captors every step of the way.

This film is set entirely in the coffin and the intermittent light source, frustrating phone calls with various government agencies and scrabble to free himself makes for one claustrophobic and chilling film.  The premise (being buried alive) is extremely scary and the political angle, whilst slightly clich, adds another angle to the film that would be missing from a straight forward kidnap thriller.

Ryna Reynolds is very good as Conroy and you feel his frustrations and fears along with him.  It is sad when he rings various family members and either gets through or reaches their answer machines.  It is very difficult to make a film of this type engaging the whole way through and whilst some elements are a little far fetched, overall this is a gripping story.

I am surprised that when a director tries to take a risk and try something new that some people are just turned off by the idea of doing something different.

It helps immerse you into Paul Conrad's situation rather than making you an on-looker from the the outside.

I'm telling you right now, at the beginning of my review, I'm going to reveal what happens at the end of the movie.  And I'm doing so because I'm angry and had I known prior to renting this movie the outcome, I never would have rented it.  So if you want to watch how everything plays out, please move along to another review.

Now...I was intrigued by the premise - guy wakes up in a box (coffin), doesn't know how he got in there, is buried with a few items (cell phone, lighter) and must try to figure out a way to escape.  And the entire movie takes place within that confined space.  Okay, I'm with you.  ""Die Hard"" in a box; let's go.

Here's what happens in a nutshell - Paul Conroy reaches out to various people on the cell phone (the display is in some Arabic/Farci language, so that's one obstacle), gets put on hold, transferred to voicemail or hung up on (by the way - who doesn't know the main FBI office is in Washington DC?).  He finally reaches the right person to ensure him that they are working on his rescue and are narrowing down a fix on the signal of the cell phone.  Hope springs eternal.

The supposed captor calls Paul and tells him $5 million dollars for his release.  The U.S. government refuses to pay.  He is reassured by his one contact that there was a guy in a similar situation who was rescued before and was living his life back in the states.  Great; more hope.

The captor sends Paul a video email of his coworker being assasinated, and tells him that his wife and family are next unless Paul sends an email video of him cutting off his own finger.  In desperation, Paul does it.  Pretty grim, but Paul is assurred that his rescuers have pinpointed where he is and to hang on for 3 more minutes.

Paul reaches his mother (who has Alzheimers) to have what he knows will be his last conversation with her, and wants to tell her he loves her.  She doesn't remember who he is.

Due to explosions above, the box/coffin is punctured and sand begins to filter in and fill up the coffin.  Almost there, you hear the digging going on.  With one bar left on the cell phone, Paul FINALLY gets to speak with his wife (who he hadn't been able to reach on her cell phone throughout the entire movie).  He tells her that he is being rescued, he loves her, he's sorry he has neglected her and that he will be home soon.  She tearfully makes him promise her over and over that he will be home soon and he promises her.  He has to hang up on her because his rescuer is calling him.  He disconnects with her, leaving her with the hope that he'll be home soon to see her and their son.  The rescuer regretfully tells him that they haven't found him after all.  We find out that he lied from before; they actually found the body of the other guy who he said they had rescued and was back at home.  He apologizes.  The sand continues to bury Paul until....he dies.  Black.  Credits roll.

Oh, but at least Paul's family back home will receive death benefits from the company Paul was working for in Iraq, so at least they'll be taken care of, right?  Actually, no.  That company called Paul as he was DYING to accuse him of having an affair with his coworker who was assasinated (what basis they had for that decision is never made clear), and because that supposedly breached the contract Paul signed with them, they were firing him.  And because his employment was terminated prior to his death, Paul's family would not receive any benefits.  And let's not forget that since the ransom was not paid, the terrorists (who have Paul's driver's license) know the address of Paul's family and will now go kill them, and will most likely get away with it.

Wow, what an inciteful entertaining movie to talk about over dinner afterwards.  Wait a minute - WHAT THE FRIGGIN' EFF???!!!!  ARE YOU FRIGGIN' KIDDING ME??

Now look.  Don't give me this crap about not all entertainment has to be happy, Hollywood, ""everything ends up fine"" kind of ending.  I love (and own) ""Moulin Rouge"" - didn't have a happy ending.  Thoroughly enjoyed ""American Beauty"" - didn't have a happy ending.

And don't go on about how this form of ""entertainment"" was about actually witnessing the emotional and harrowing journey firsthand of how being in this situation would be.  You don't have to spell out for me what it must be like to be eaten by a shark.  I don't need to sit through 90 minutes of seeing some bleed to death from getting their leg caught in a bear trap.  I don't need to see a movie about being a plane that slams into the side of building and everybody dies - I can pretty much imagine those are not pleasant experiences, and if that scenario is actually worse, why would I want to watch something that's worse than my own imagination?  With the movie ""127 Minutes"" (**another spoiler alert**), he went through that horrible experience, but at least he escaped and was able to continue living his life!  Where is the payoff of no hope?

I will give the movie this - for an entire movie to take place in a confined area like this, the director really has to be imaginative with how the movie is shot, and from that standpoint, he kept it interesting.  And as there were no other visible ""co-stars"" per se (except a cameo from a snake...), Ryan Reynolds really had his work cut out for him, and he did a great job as an actor.  And I understand that some foreign directors make movies that have a rather grim opinion of ""entertainment"" (like the laughfest ""Pan's Labyrinth"").

But as far as the general story, if you're going to put the viewer through this, you'd BETTER have some sort of a resolution other than he's placed in that situation AND he dies; otherwise what is the point?  In the movie description, ""Paul has only ninety minutes to be rescued before his worst nightmare comes true.""  Well, his (and everyone else's) worse nightmare DOES come true.  So what lesson do we take away from this movie?  What have we gained from watching this experience?  Here it is - certain Iraqis don't think very highly of Americans, and bad things tend to happen over there.  OH, GEE - REALLY??  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that the world is a horrible place and that these things (or worse) go on.  I know the reality; I don't need to see something like this played out in real time unless I can be rewarded with a happy outcome.  That is ""escapism"" which is what entertainment should be.",1299974400,3,6412,4.4319931565440545

However, the script and the plot don't help him at all.

I hear that he has other things in the coffin with him, but I couldn't watch anymore of the film. Most of us would realize that there is a limited supply of air in a coffin, but Reynolds keeps lighting the lighter to make phone calls. The cell phone provides its own light, so why use a lighter every time you make a call? This is one of the many puzzling things that I noticed during the short time that I watched. Also, I can understand that any person would panic if they found themselves locked in a coffin and buried in Iraq of all places, but some things really don't make sense. As a military contractor, he doesn't realize that the U.S. government won't pay ransoms for captured personnel. Also, he seems to want to antagonize everyone he calls to get help. On one call someone asks him for his social security number. He gets angry and starts asking why they want it instead of simply giving it to the person. I mean, how else are they going to be able to identify you as the appropriate person (he lost the security number that was given to him by the contract company). I don't know about you, but if I was given an emergency number to use in case something happened while working in Iraq during a war, I would make sure I memorized it, tattooed it on my skin, and do whatever else I could to make sure it is available in case something happened.

I believe what made this film so chilling was how easily it could occur. The apathy of corporations, sheer helplessness of an individual facing possible death as well the furious frustrations of those who honestly wish to help, the value of money and public imagery over the lives of people, the injustices of life are all very real.

I have noticed many commenters here are are whining about the ending. I will say I thought the ending was perfect for the film, even if it left me chilled to the bone. It is realistic and very plausible, not a happy-sappy Disney-esqe ending that Hollywood mindlessly delivers in most films.

BURIED (Spain/USA/France-2010) is the sad and frightening story of Paul Conroy, a truck driver sent to Iraq by his contractor employer to help with that country's rebuilding. After a group of Iraqis kill some of his friends, Paul is captured and knocked unconscious. He awakens in a totally dark place, fumbles around and finds his lighter, an old-fashioned metal one. Paul soon realizes he's been imprisoned in a wooden box, and since its walls can't be budged, he must be buried alive! Rage and panic quickly set in.

An Iraqi calls, issues a 9 PM deadline for his release and demands a $5 million ransom. Paul begs to be freed from his tomb right now but is refused. His captors have supplied him with two glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, the cellphone, and a pen kife. On him he's got a small flask of alcohol and a bottle of anti-anxiety pills.

BURIED (Spain/USA/France-2010) is the sad and frightening story of Paul Conroy, a truck driver sent to Iraq by his contractor employer to help with that country's rebuilding. After a group of Iraqis kill some of his friends, Paul is captured and knocked unconscious. He awakens in a totally dark place, fumbles around and finds his lighter, an old-fashioned metal one. Paul soon realizes he's been imprisoned in a wooden box, and since its walls can't be budged, he must be buried alive! Rage and panic quickly set in.

An Iraqi calls, issues a 9 PM deadline for his release upon receipt of a $5 million ransom. Paul begs to be freed from his tomb right now but is refused. His captors have supplied him with two glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, the cellphone, and a pen kife. On him he's got a small flask of alcohol and a bottle of anti-anxiety pills. Both soon come in handy.

4287530,4,B004919RHI,"This is probably one of the better films for suspense I've seen since Wages Of Fear.

If you think that a film that takes place inside a seven by three foot box would be dull - you are wrong.

I don't understand how anyone could give this film one, two or even three star reviews accept that some folks could not take the propaganda, the subject matter or the very dark black aspects of the film.  And if that is the case - I can understand why.

The plot - a contractor is held hostage in Iraq - buried underground in a coffin sized box with a lighter a crappy flashlight and a cell phone with a dying battery.

This is grueling, suspenseful, and technically brilliant film making and a least the flms star should have gotten an academy award nomination if not the director.

I wondered if the film makers were sometimes aiming for black comedy ala Hitchcock - think along the lines of Frenzy, Psycho and Life Boat.  If so - they should have also listened to Hitchcock describe the cause for his box office flop Saboteur.

Buried also reminded me of some of the better aspects of two other clustrophobic trapped people films Shuttle and Open Waters - Spoiler here - both with extremely dark down endings.

Buried is a must see for any film maker or aspiring film maker or anyone who craves clever film making and good suspense.  If Hitchcock had made a movie from this script - It could not have been any more suspenseful but if Hitchcock had made it - he would have cut out the propoganda tweaked the ending and maybe his film might not have flopped.

Now for the propaganda - and this is not meant to take anything away from the film-making aspects which were all top notch. There is allot of anti-west propaganda in the script for Buried.  For example - There is sympathy for an extremly cruel murdering kidnaper described as ""He's just like you, his family is starving - what would you do on his situation?"" hmmm. And then painting every western company, government agency or person with an American or English accent as either cold blooded or inept or both.

The American victim is a very unsympathetic character. He seems to be the cause of his own problems both outside and in the box. (I almost wondered if the film makers relished giving him what he gets - I for one was not on their side) Buried paints the victim as a not to smart American mercenary who drinks, takes anxiety medicine, is an abusive x-husband and is cheating on his present wife and mother of his kids.

Had Buried not been so clever, well made and well acted I would have given far less stars for interjecting crappy political propaganda.  Hey - I don't mind when a writer or director are up front about their politics - but please don't sneak it in your film.  It's darn boring and you are toying with making a box office flop - and in this case it is what happened.

Otherwise - with some reservations - it's still great film making.",1298160000,5,2915,4.428838951310861
4287531,4,B004919RHI,I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie. There was a lot suspense and it took a lot of talent to make a movie that is entirely filmed inside of a box the size of a coffin. The scene with the snake was terrifying.

Overall good but definitely a rental movie rather than a purchase as I can not see myself watching it again.",1297641600,,415,4.135802469135802
4287533,2,B004919RHI,"Don't delude yourself with this dreadful drivel!

Spanish director Rodrigo Corts and scenarist Chris Sparling take a surefire predicament straight out of the annals of horror writer Edgar Allan Poe about an individual trapped inextricably in a coffin and take it for a grim 21st century spin.  Poe lived in fear that he would appear to die and his apparently lifeless body would prompt authorities to consign him to a coffin.  Later, he would wake up underground with nowhere to go and nobody to save him.  The death-like trance that obsessed Poe is called catalepsy, and America's foremost horror author penned his memorable short story ""The Premature Burial"" about it.  Moviegoers who haven't read the Poe story or seen an adaptation might favorably compare ""Buried"" to either French director George Sluizer's intense abduction chiller ""The Vanishing"" (1988) or his American remake of it with Jeff Bridges in 1993.  The thing that sets the flawed Corts apart from it is that everything occurs in the coffin in ""Buried.""

In ""Buried,"" an innocent, average, blue-collar, working-class guy, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds of ""Blade Trinity""), awakens with a jolt to find himself entombed in a wooden crate buried six feet underground with no way to escape.  Our hero has no idea how he wound up in the coffin.  During a brief inventory, he discovers that he has a Zippo lighter, his Hamilton wristwatch, some glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, a knife, and a Blackberry cell phone with a battery that needs a recharge.  Desperately, Paul tries to contact anybody who can rescue him, but he gets either answering machine messages or busy signals.  Eventually, he contacts a 911 operator, an FBI agent, and later on an Embassy employee with a British accent.  In every instance, he has to indulge his contacts with an explanation about his incredible situation and admittedly gets very rude and profane with them when they ask him imbecilic questions.

As it turns out, Paul worked as a civilian contractor driving a truck in Iraq in 2006.  Insurgents attacked his convoy, massacring everybody else, but they spared Paul for something infinitely worse. They took him hostage while he was still unconscious and buried him alive.  Indeed, Paul doesn't know where they have buried him.  The villains give him an ultimatum. Not only must he make a YouTube video with a script written out for him, but he also must raise $5 million for his ransom.  Moreover, Paul has only about two hours to complete this onerous task before he exhausts air in his coffin. Just to emphasize the hopelessness of his predicament, Corts and Sparling reveal that our hero only has $700 in his bank account.  Paul is a nobody with a wife and a young son.

Mind you, the suspense and tension that Cortes and Sparling generate is of the intense, white-knuckled variety, and ""Buried"" is pretty gripping until the bottom falls out during last few moments and the tension dissolves in a heartbeat.  There is nothing mesmerizing, brilliant, or groundbreaking about this cynical bit of manipulation.  Worse, Corts and Sparling stick in moments that defy credibility.  At one point, a poisonous black snake slithers out of our protagonist's pants and curls up in the far corner of the coffin.  How did the snake get into the coffin, especially since our doomed hero slams his body around in the enclosure for at least a half-hour or moment in an act of hysterical madness?  The surprise, in a sense, is that the snake didn't bite Paul. The reptile crawls away and never returns.

Ultimately, the payoff in ""Buried"" comes as a horrendous letdown.  In a memorable suspense thriller, the filmmakers often reward the audience for their extreme patience, but Cortes and Sparling provide nothing in the way of relief. They provide an ending that serves only to frustrate us for watching a sympathetic character suffer a fate beyond anything that is imaginable. The only catharsis in ""Buried"" is that there is no catharsis, just a cop-out of the most misguided sort.  Indeed, the formula for a good movie involves the use of surprises and reversals.  The ending here qualifies as a surprise, but it is the kind of surprise that makes you wish that you had never seen this movie.

Ryan Reynolds does a commendable job of winning our approbation.  Sadly, the protagonist emerges as nothing more than a pawn of corporate America, vengeful Iraqis, and derisive filmmakers.  The company that employed our hero terminates him the day that the insurgents abducted and confined him in the coffin because he had violated a non-fraternization clause.  Apparently, Paul engaged in some kind of relationship with another employee.  ""Buried"" treats its hero with a complete lack of compassion.  You will feel cheated by the depressing ending.  Presumably, Lionsgate did not release ""Buried"" to theaters after they promoted the 95-minute film because studio executives feared that the wretched wrap-up would alienate audiences rather than entertain them.

Aside from Reynolds' convincing portrait of claustrophobic hysteria under dire conditions, actor Stephen Tobolowsky makes the greatest impression as CRT company representative Alan Davenport who strings poor Paul along in one scene about a contract violation.  Unless you enjoy movies that paint you into a corner that not even Houdini could have gotten out of, ""Buried"" with its muddled conspiratorial world politics and heavily accented villain is not worth the anxiety.  What could have been a terrific movie turns out to be just a cinematic gimmick about a guy in a box.  Nevertheless, Corts and company produced this low-budget melodrama for $2 million and it has raked in $18-million, making it a hit despite its limited showings.",1297555200,2,5729,5.054255319148936
4287534,1,B004919RHI,I just lost one hour and fourty minutes of my Life I will never get back :( this movie was HORRIBLE,1297296000,3,99,3.761904761904762
4287535,2,B004919RHI,"Where oh where to begin?  ""Buried"" has been widely praised by critics and moviegoers alike.  I have no idea why.  Were they brainwashed during the 94 minute hell hole that is ""Buried""?  Did Ryan Reynolds personally go to each critics house and do their laundry?  This film was poorly written, acted and the third act was not put together well at all.  It's a shame too because the beginning of the film had promise.  I had high hopes for the star Ryan Reynolds based on his impressive performance in ""The Amityville Horror"" remake, unfortunately he didn't deliver in this outing.  This film is the definition of the phrase ""style over substance"".

""Buried"" is the story of an American contractor working in Iraq as a driver.  His group is ambushed by supposed terrorists who kill some and kidnap others.  Paul played by Reynolds does not fair so well as he is buried alive in the vast Iraq desert.  The film begins as a black screen with hardly any sound, we start to hear breathing as tension and fear begins to build.  Paul realizes that he's been buried underground with a cell phone, Zippo lighter, knife, flask of alcohol, flashlight and glow-sticks.  His battle begins to find a way out of the grave danger he's in when the kidnappers call demanding a ransom.

First, the good things; though they are few.  The decision to film entirely inside the coffin was smart.  It added an extra layer of realism to an already terrifying concept.  ""Buried"" was very well shot and produced as seen in the first act.  It had excellent sound and camera work as well so the tension was genuine.  Director of Photography Eduard Grau gave just enough space between the camera and Reynolds to not overdue the claustrophobic feeling.  The cinematography scored very high points for me, hence the 2/5 instead of 1/5.  The idea of being buried for ransom was new and I appreciated Iraq being the setting.  The first act was intense and fearful as the plot began to come around, but it was ruined with the second and third acts.

I mentioned the concept was fresh and new, which I appreciated, but the way in which the plot unfolded was just ridiculous.  There were so many instances that I thought were just completely implausible and unnecessary.  Once Paul finally gets in contact with the State Department, the representative quietly and secretively tells him to contact a group specifically set up in the middle east to deal with kidnap situations.  Why on earth would this information had to have been whispered to Paul?  Why couldn't the State Department just contact them for Paul?  A very unrealistic moment.

One of the things left in the coffin for Paul to find was a ""Zippo"" lighter.  He had that thing lit for more than half of the film.  In a low oxygen environment that isn't the best idea.  Not to mention it seemed to have a constant abundance of butane.  Also, when using the cell phone he continued to use the Zippo to light the space in front of him.  Sure this works for the camera lighting but is this realistic? No.

Speaking of the cell phone, it was obvious (and told to Paul), that since he was getting a signal he was not that far beneath the surface.  At one point someone says to him that he must not be more than three feet down.  If I were Paul I would have found a way to break through the wood and dig upwards three feet to safety.  So again, unrealistic.

Those are just a few examples of why this movie fails.  At one point later in the film I literally felt insulted by the writing.  It is such a shame too because this had high potential to be a unique, intense movie experience.  I can't fault Reynolds completely because I know he has the chops to pull of intense drama but he just was not directed well.  ""Buried"" was made by inexperienced filmmakers and it showed.  It boggles my mind that this is getting such good reviews, specifically from the likes of Roger Ebert.

I only need to direct you to the ""100 Things we learned from Buried"" thread on IMDB's message board to see the kind of terrible writing showcased in this film.  See it and form your own opinion.  Drop me a line if you agree or disagree.

Then there are those loved by only a small few.

Bottom line, this movie required some very creative directing, writing, acting and lighting.  To make a movie that takes place entirely inside of a coffin is an ambitious venture.  Here it is quite well done.  Just when you think where else can they go with this, they come up with some other plot device to move things along.

this movie is definitely outside of the mainstream romcom action adventure horror BS that we're all subjected to day in and day out from hollywood.  truly unique story lines are hard to find.  while the notion of being buried alive isn't a new one, and this movie certainly causes one to reflect back to tom hanks with his volleyball on the island, it is unique and enjoyable through and through.

I wasted almost 20 minutes fiddling with the stinking commercials, credits, and menu system before I could actually see this stupid movie.

I have a real beef with the fact that the bloody disc has 10 minutes of commercials on it prior to the main menu ever showing up.  And then I have yet to figure out how to turn the closed captioning on.  I can see where it is supposed to be toggled on or off, but no key press on my remote seems to be able to turn them on properly.

I think I wasted a full five minutes trying to do that before giving up.

Then once you finally get to the movie, guess what, there is almost a full five minutes of music and credits at the beginning of the movie.  No action, no people, nothing.

Combine all of that with my slow loading Panasonic Blu-Ray player and the fact that I was starving and just wanted to sit down, relax, eat my meal in front of the tube, and enjoy a little entertainment, these people basically almost sent me ballistic.

Ryan Reynolds is an extremely good actor who usually makes really good movies, I don't recall any movies of his that I didn't like except for The Proposal - which was a weak romantic comedy. I loved Just Friends/Waiting.../Van Wilder/Buying the Cow. I thought this one (Buried) was just - I'm not sure how to say this but - weird. Your just watching Ryan Reynolds talk to people through a cell phone/ect. The movie is strange, but the funny thing is, is that it isn't a horrible film, but not an award winning, which you can tell it was supposed to be. I watched it and I predicted the ending (and I was correct). But the movie isn't that long, but it is enjoyable. It seems like a PG-13 thriller since there's hardly violence, it's just language. The movie is pretty good and probably one of those movies you watch one time.",1296086400,,838,4.4480519480519485

Buried I'd say is worth the one star, but only because of Ryan Renolds acting, although renting it on Blu-Ray thinking it might be of better quality I have to say it isn't worth the extra cost.  The movie has no point whatever unless it was trying to convince Americans not to go to countries like Irag or Afganistan in civilian jobs to make presumably a lot of money.  In the end the company Renold's character works for sells him out so as not to have to pay the insurance when he turns up dead. Add to the lack of substance, a margin of gore to the Nth degree and you have yourself a one star movie.",1296086400,2,736,4.097222222222222
4287558,1,B004919RHI,"ABSOLUTE WORST MOVIE I have EVER forced myself through.  A guy in a box.  OK, A buried coffin.  Either way, that is the movie.  Him in the box succumbing to fear. Who wouldn't.  You're buried alive.  He does what any person would do, freak out.  He also does what most people know not to do.  Make deals with terrorists.  They never keep their end of the deal, so why would you even consider it?  Its a frustrating film that only makes you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself to save the time and money and clean the gutters or re-organize your bills instead. At least you would know that the agony would pay off in the end.  I don't want to spoil the film for anyone,.. oh wait.  I already did.  Its about a guy in a box, freaking out, making deals with terrorists.  At least it ended realistically.  Fortunately, after dragging myself through this ""movie"", I was actually able to finish watching ""Hobgoblins"" (1988).
  My Advice,  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Some call the movie ""cerebral"" (bull), or ""thrilling"" (for like 1 whole minute at exactly the middle of the movie), or even ""suspenseful"" (which I must agree as you are thoroughly in suspense for the movie to finally end), but I call it ""a big waste of time"", ""agonizingly boring"", and ""mind-shatteringly ridiculous""!

You 'get' nothing new from this movie, it just reinstates negative thinking about the system. The acting was fine, but there are plenty of things I would have said differently, if I was in his shoes. (Won't say what, in case you just have to see it, no matter how many people say it's not worth it.) It's a sad movie, not one feel good moment and that is just how you feel when it's over.

4287565,5,B004919RHI,"Ryan Reynolds in a box for an hour and a half. That's how it was sold, that's what I was expecting, but that's not what I got. Ryan Reynolds could have been in a box anywhere else in the world, and the director still probably would have churned out an effective thriller. But I get the feeling that this was not a thriller by design. Ryan Reynolds is in a box, buried somewhere in the Iraqi desert, and help seems sooner to come from the people who put him there than the country that employed him. Why is that?

As is, this is an effective thriller. Don't expect to be frightened; expect tension, a touch of claustrophobia, and those uncomfortable moments when you find yourself trying to decide what YOU would do if you ever found yourself in the same predicament. You have a phone, a Zippo lighter, and a collection of pencils. Who do you call? Just how patient could you remain in a coffin, buried somewhere, at some depth, knowing your oxygen was slowly dwindling down to nothing?

Visualizing the method for filming BURIED, I can tell production probably involved  not much more than Ryan Reynolds in a cheap coffin, in a dark area, for long stretches of time in some film studio somewhere. But Ryan Reynolds made me believe that he was a truck driver for a contractor company who suddenly found himself buried alive. His acting here is amazingly involving. He asked all the questions I would have asked, with just the right amount of intensity, and lost his cool at all the right cues. Again, Ryan Reynolds in a box for an hour and a half, but I believed every second of it.

But what I loved the most about this film was that it really aspired to be more than just a thriller. If help for Reynolds's character came immediately, it would be a really short movie. Most of his tribulations in that coffin stem from the inability and, in some cases, complete unwillingness of his contacts to rescue him. His capture becomes something less than a simple ""search and rescue"" in the eyes of the military and his employers, and becomes something a little more political. At some point, you have to stop and wonder if something like this would actually happen. Maybe, maybe not, but what's the life of one truck driver worth to a company that could stand to lose millions? Or to a branch of the military that might be publicly embarrassed by the incident?

Good question! That's all I can say. This was a great movie that, to me, worked on several different levels, played at various moral dilemmas, and showed that Ryan Reynolds definitely has the talent worthy of something more than the odd comedy. If he doesn't get a nomination, I'd be surprised.",1295827200,2,2650,4.5588235294117645

4287567,5,B004919RHI,"BURIED is not a film for everyone.  It is a very cerebral piece that requires the audience to enter into a place that is terrifyingly desperate, grow to know the many messages that the main character represents, and be willing to experience a very non-Hollywood ending.  Written with great courage by Chris Sparling and directed with consummate skill by young Spanish director Rodrigo Corts, this film is a challenge for the single character in the film and Ryan Reynolds reaches one of the highest achievements of his career.

The time is 2006 in Iraq and Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) works for a trucking company as a contracted civilian. His convoy is attacked and many of his fellow non-military workers are killed: Paul is placed in a coffin and buried, with only a cigarette lighter and a cellphone.  The film begins in the dark, that same dark that surrounds the entrapped Paul who realizes he has limited oxygen supply and must find a way to escape or meet death. He tries to use the cellphone, but encounters the usual monstrous difficulties we all face daily - automated answering machines, operators who insist on unnecessary information before helping him, futile attempts to connect with his family, calls from his attackers demanding ransom to set him free, contact with the government departments who shuffle his requests until the appropriate person is reached who is unable to correctly assist, calls from his employer in the States who demands he give a recorded message relinquishing his rights  and firing him for groundless reasons.  Throughout the 90 minutes that we spend with Paul in the coffin we feel the terror, hear the explosions, feel the agony as he speaks briefly with his wife, leaves a cellphone video for his son, and says goodbye to his nursing home mother suffering from dementia.

The ending of the film must be withheld, as it is unexpected.  What the writer and the director and the actor have managed to do in this claustrophobic nightmare is point out many facts about the US involvement in the Middle East - both military and civilian contractors - and hear the reasons behind the situation from the Middle Eastern viewpoint.  It is a very difficult movie to experience but one that is a brilliantly condensed statement about the madness of war.  Ryan Reynolds delivers a performance completely solo and manages to create a wholly unforgettable, completely compelling character that will never leave our mind.

4287570,5,B004919RHI,"It seems to me that the least I can do to recognize what must have been a hellish experience for actor Ryan Reynolds is to give this movie five stars. Reynolds powerfully portrays Paul Conroy, an American truck driver in Iraq who is taken hostage by Iraqi extortionists and buried alive. The movie is about how he desperately tries to survive by making contact with an outside world that includes callous terrorists, cold bureaucrats, non-caring ""friends""/relatives, and the heartless company that hired him to go to Iraq. He is also frustrated by people who are not picking up because they are not at home or are not aware of Conroy's plight.

The entire film is shot from the perspective of Conroy, trapped in a coffin. He has a cell phone with camera, a cigarette lighter, and a couple of lights apparently provided by his kidnappers so that he can film a video while he is trapped. Hence, we are able to witness Conroy's terror.

Turns out he also has a companion in the coffin. This companion is not a nubile starlet.

Of course, Reynolds was not really confined in a coffin, but it all still must have been supremely taxing for him.

For a movie that was set in a coffin the entire time, the movie's director and writer did an incredibly job of holding the audience's attention. It didn't go the pretentious route, which is admirable.

I am really not trying to be arrogant. This was a good movie. I can't speak for art snobs, but if you're a person who likes finding movies that are diamonds in the rough, watch Buried.

Nope, it ain't gonna happen here.  Don't be expecting flashbacks and dream sequences invading an intricate storyline with complex twists and turns.  The 90 minute runtime never for a moment strays away from its confiscated setting.  That's right, an hour and a half watching pretty boy Ryan Reynolds trapped in a box.  Patience will be required.

Claustrophobes, this is most likely your worst nightmare.  Heck, it's be tough on anyone--precious little air, hardly any light, a cellphone with the battery draining...I'm guessing he probably crapped his pants too.  Oh, dirt is seeping in the coffin as well, so homeboy is getting smothered and covered like my Waffle House hashbrowns.  Plus there might be a few surprises and unexpected dangers that are soon revealed.

One thing is for certain--Reynolds can act.  No more is his relegated exclusively to the smart-aleck, penis & fart joke roles.  A remarkable performance.  He plays a civilian truck driver in Iraq that wakes up buried alive.  Sheesh!  That's worse than gaining consciousness next to a dead hooker.  Fortunately he has a cell phone, and he frantically calls different numbers for help.

Buried is shot in real time and has some subtle but provocative points.  Director Rodrigo Cortes even expertly mixes in some sly dark comedy.  It all amounts to a slow-paced, tension-filled drama that is quite a revealing character study.  It definitely won't appeal to the masses, but it's an excellent change of pace so rarely attempted in cinema.",1295654400,2,1652,5.2251908396946565

For what Buried is, an 80 minute movie featuring only one physical actor and taking place in a wooden box, it never gets boring, which is impressive. Claustrophobics will probably want to avoid this. I'm not claustrophobic but I found myself having to take huge breaths of air watching this. It's dark and very confined, and it's intense.  There are a few things in the movie that are totally unbelievable, which I won't mention to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but as long as you can suspend your disbelief (which you have to do with most movies) this is an enjoyable story.  Ryan Reynolds' acting is solid here. I actually cared about his character and felt all his anger, sadness and frustration throughout the course of the story.

I don't think I've ever seen a movie that takes place in one small confined setting, which is what drew me to Buried in the first place. I highly recommend this. Watch it in a dark room with no distractions to really get into it.
