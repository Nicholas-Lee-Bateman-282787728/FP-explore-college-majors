7879499,4,630493789X,"It's a typical,cliche'd B movie but it's pretty entertaining. I like Parker Stevenson in this----not his usual ""nice guy"" role.",1399075200,,127,5.4

7879501,5,630493789X,"Thrilling, delightful B-movie which defies the limitations of its budget to create an unforgettable viewing experience.",1012780800,3,119,6.5
7879502,3,630493789X,"This sci-fi thriller follows one of the classic mystery-thriller storylines: a group of strangers is brought together in a remote location and then begin to die one by one. In this case, the ""strangers"" are military prisoners who have accepted a highly dangerous mission in lieu of execution, the ""remote location"" is an enemy fueling station, and the deaths are grisly murders which seem to have been committed by something as much beast as human. Who is doing the killing? And why? And why aren't there any enemy soldiers at this supposedly important base?
Terry Farrell plays the major in command of the unit, with Parker Stevenson as her #2 -- and the first person to start to figure out what's wrong. Corey Feldman and Rick Springfield are also featured. Each of them does a nice job with their part -- not that they've been given a lot to work with.
I'm a sci-fi fan, but I'm not into thrillers or space-military movies. I wouldn't give this movie more than one or two stars if I wasn't also a Parker Stevenson fan -- and reviews I've seen here and elsewhere lead me to suspect that unless you're a fan of Farrell, Stevenson, Feldman or Sprigfield you probably won't want to invest much time or money on this film.",1006387200,8,1220,4.60091743119266
7879503,1,630493789X,"Terry Farrell, Rick Springfield, Parker Stevenson, Corey Feldman are the ""headline"" actors in this flat and slow moving Sci-Fi Channel exclusive.  None of them are directed to their potential in this excuse of  an ""Aliens"" wannabe.  Poor storyline also contributes.  Only buy  this if you are a deranged fan of one of the actors and you want to throw  away a hundred bucks.",943660800,4,373,4.841269841269841
