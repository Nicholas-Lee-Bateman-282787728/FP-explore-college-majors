1689949,1,B000063ENZ,"i should have known that when you watch somethin from full moon your going to get full moon quality.  terrible movie, simply terrible.  5 hot girls go into a house to have a chance to win a million dollars.  all they have to do is complete the challenges laid in front of them by the director who is putting the show on tv.  only thing is that the house is really haunted and all hell breaks loose, ya right!  sounds like a good movie but it's really not.  not entertaining one bit.  move on and check out somethin else.  really wish i could give this movie less than 1 star.",1027814400,4,575,4.163636363636364
1689950,1,B000063ENZ,"An insult. I don't want to hear how the film company was working with a ""limited"" budget. There are a lot of ""cheap"" films out there, but this movie looks bad, is directed badly, has terrible acting, and a worthless, tired story. Tempe Entertainment, the company that put this out, is known for planting positive reviews of their films so people will think they have some massive fan following. Don't believe it! As a fan of good-bad movies, this rates so low 1 star is too much. Avoid this! You've been warned!",1019865600,5,511,4.565217391304348

7959163,1,B000063ENZ,"Wow, this movies stunk.  I mainly wanted to get some Brinke Stevens films and this ""sounded"" ok, but was i ever wrong.

Even one of the few good moments turns comical when the ghost demon thing pulls one of the girls up a chimney and blood and bones fall... well, i didn't know she had 3 femur bones!!!  Strangely they seemed to have a location, but i guess were restricted to only 3 rooms of it... it literally takes place in 2 rooms and a hallway and the basement.

So, yeah i like cheesy movies but this seemed very rushed and thrown together.",1404172800,,546,4.271844660194175
7959164,4,B000063ENZ,"This film involves a group participating in a reality TV show where they travel through a haunted house that has these humanoid fiends wearing cloaks. The film has no nudity, and it doesn't really have any suspense or much effective atmosphere. The scenery and characters are also uninteresting, and it isn't scary at all. What it does have going for it is the gore. At least they got that right and some of the gory sequences are as follows: there's a scene when a cloaked demon grapples a woman and you see her guts splatter on the floor; a scene when a girl is pulled up through a chimney and her guts and bones splatter down; and a gory blood-spraying decapitation as well as some other gory scenes, like an intestine munching scene near the end. The film has some unnecessary filler, and it's a little bit slow in parts. In between the gore, the film may bore some people because there isn't much interesting stuff happening. Some of that unnecessary dialogue hurts the film; they should've taken out some dialogue scenes because it just slows up the pace. The only reason to see this flick is for the violence and gore. Since this is just an exploitation flick, the decision to not include any nudity hurts the film as well. A lot of the film is dimly lit, so this also might annoy some people.  I thought the cloaked fiends were cool and liked the blood and guts, but whether or not you'll like it will depend on your taste.

The movie has grain, but I thought it looked good overall. There are plenty of extras on the DVD. The teaser trailer is well done and has good music, but the best extra is the short flick called MULVA: ZOMBIE ASS KICKER. This short film is a shot-on-VHS piece of garbage. This is a ridiculous short horror comedy about a candy and junk-food addicted geek who has her Halloween interrupted by zombies. It has cheap gore and is absolutely awful. It was so bad that I enjoyed it; at least you get an entire short movie for an extra feature.",1375660800,,1970,4.454293628808864
7959165,2,B000063ENZ,"This is a low budget version of ""The Task."" 5 babes are locked in a genuine rigged haunted house and must spend the night and perform certain tasks based on their fears. The movie starts out with the producer begging for money to do the pilot. As he gets what he wants he walks out of the office to some great heavy metal swagger music, but there is no slo-mo swagger to go with the music. I mean how much would that cost?

The eventual killing of said babes lacks imagination. It is just plain slash and remove guts. No imagination in writing. The movie had potential, and if it was tweaked it would have been worth a view.

F-bomb, No nudity.",1316390400,,644,4.270491803278689
7959166,2,B000063ENZ,"I am giving this loser 2 stars because of the guts of everyone who worked on this stinker to put there name on it. If I saw any of these people in public I would encourage a good old lynching. There is not one level this movie is not bad on,except one. THE END,that was the only good thing about it. I paid one cent for this,and that was to much.",1288137600,,346,3.887323943661972
7959167,3,B000063ENZ,"For years now the world has been subjected to some of the worst B horror out there courtesy of Full Moon Pictures (well worst or best depending of how you see it). There hasn't been a let up for the past decade which is something the brothers Sid couldn't be more happy about. Yeah sure these movies are simply awful at best, but provide enough entertainment value to keep us coming back for more year after year. One would ask what could possibly draw anybody to a film called Hell Asylum that has such an awful looking cover? Well for us it's simple. We have two reasons: 1) Joe Estevez! 2) It's a film we had previously watched nearly 8 years ago late on a Saturday night. So obviously it's worth it for us just on sentimental value alone. Please...most couldn't stomach this one to watch it all the way through once and you've got us revisiting it for a second time. Oh..no..no..not a second time.

Hell Asylum opens up the only way it should, with a 10 minutes injection of Joe Estevez whose screen name here is Stan the investor. See Stan is getting pitched the idea for a new horror reality show in which he decides to invest all his savings of Arby's coupons into. Once the coupons clear the show starts rolling in what seems to be a county building closed for a long weekend. Our guess was the director was the janitor for this building and had the key to let the crew in to shoot for a couple days. The concept behind the show is to have 5 ""hot"" chicks stay in a haunted house to face their fears. So it's somewhat of a B show within an even more B movie. What isn't known is the building is really haunted by a few guy's that walk around in black robes. One by one they kill the crew and eat their insides, which were nothing more then red rope licorice with raspberry jelly poured on top. And that's pretty much the entire movie in full detail.

In good conscience we could never recommend Hell Asylum on a serious level, but could recommend it to those who want to see nothing more then about 15 minutes of Joe Estevez. His acting in this one is so over the top it will leave you in tears and amazement in the fact he keeps getting work. Clearly he hasn't earned more then $50 for any of these roles but just having a job in today's economy is a good thing. Despite it's horrific acting, zero plot, and even less scares then you'd imagine it was still enjoyable to revisit it. Mostly because it took the old boy Sid back to better days...but even more then that Joe Estevez! We can't get enough of Uncle Joe and his horrendous acting which is what earned Hell Asylum a very generous 3 star rating. If you do decide you spend your time watching it make you you don't pay much for it.",1281312000,,2695,4.2720156555773
7959168,3,B000063ENZ,"A sleazy producer gets an idea for a reality show, he puts five ""sexy"" girls in a real haunted house and offers them a potential one million dollars if they survive the night.

This is low budget and the acting isn't always great, but it isn't all bad. With a budget it could have been a big movie. My big complaint would be that there wasn't enough story, and it was too fast. The whole thing is 72 minutes long, so there was no opportunity to build up any suspense. Also, it would have been nice if there was a more serious explanation as to why the house was haunted and a better attempt at trying to get rid of the ghosts. A few tweaks of the script and it would have been sweet.",1144022400,2,683,4.097014925373134
7959169,1,B000063ENZ,"If I had not of gotten this movie as 1 of the 10 that comes in a regioun 4 pack called ""Horror: 10 movies pack"" then I wouldnt have taken any notice of this s**t-flick.

The plot is about a new reality TV show called ""Chill Factor"" where a few bimbos are picked to go into a place thats haunted. They give the rundown and history of the house and spend half the movie showing interveiw style introductions to eacxh character. One by one they start off on there challenge and one by one there picked off by the worst looking ghosts off all time.

It's all filmed like a stupid reality TV show. The weird thing is, when 2 guys are setting up the cameras in the house, they are putting down RTV which I liked, but thats it as far as mocking the stupid RTV stuff, it trys to just be a RTV show after that.

The ghosts are just black hooded coats with blue Darth Maul makeup on who just raise there arms and then eat knitting string dipped in pigs blood trying to get the effect of eating someones guts for absolutly no reason.

The characters are lame, they focus too much on one character and then kill her off before you eyes, they add stupid little side plots to it, they show nothing of the house, it leaves many questions to be asked and the end is total and utter crap.

The film starts to look like it's about to get exciting and start to go somewhere, but before it does, the credits roll ater a predictable phrase.

I'm glad my edition doesnt come with the extras 'cause I wouldnt have wanted to see them anyway. This film completly rips off the remake of House On Haunted hill.

If you think this movie was the slightest bit entertaining, then go and find House On Haunted Hill (98/99?) and see what this badly titled film Hell Asylum is ripping off in an already done RTV satire.

And who the heck are the other ghosts??? It explains who one of them is, but about 3 are seen... plus they needed to show the frankenstein bride they talk about. This movie is careless, dumb, pointless and as entertaining as a real RTV show.",1120521600,,2029,4.251948051948052
