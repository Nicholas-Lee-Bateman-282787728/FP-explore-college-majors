2053322,5,B00020W0WO,This DVD is awesome. Anyone who followed the Stanley Cup Playoffs would not be dissapointed with the coverage NHL productions did on this DVD. IT has a full broadcast of Game 7 on it as well as interviews with Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards and a full bio on the lightnings season and Playoff run. Buy it while u can cause it shows why the lightning are the STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONS :).,1090195200,6,387,4.315068493150685
8019687,5,B00020W0WO,Solved my short hdmi cord problem for way less being that I had a spare hdmi. Cheaper than getting a longer cable. Fast shipping.,1392854400,,129,4.416666666666667
8019688,5,B00020W0WO,"This was a perfect purchase. It was delivered way before I had hoped to get it  (about 10 days ear;ier than Amazon's expected  delivery date).  Most importantly, it is a great DVD.  Perfect, not only for a longtime Lightning fan like myself (living in Europe, where I had to survive for years on sporadic showings of 'NHL On The Fly' for my North American hockey fix) but for anyone who has an interest in NHL history. This was the last pre- (2004-2005) lockout Stanley Cup finals, thev last before the league  is said to have significantly sped up. Watch the full Game 7 which is on the DVD and compare to  the 'new' NHL.
I can't see that much difference apart from taking out the red line but, as I said, TV coverage here (Ireland) was negligable until the 2005-2006 season.
As well as the treat of the complete Game 7, the main feature is excellent too.  The story of Tampa Bay's journey from being the worst team in the league-when I started following them -to becoming champions still reads like an incredlible Hollywood story.  Wish I had been able to properly follow that journey first time around.  This DVD made up (and makes up) for that regret.  To any NHL fan-get it! And...Go Bolts!!!",1386892800,,1197,4.525581395348837
8019689,5,B00020W0WO,I have been looking for this DVD forever in stores and could never find it. It was so nice to get a brand new copy at such a great price!,1378857600,,137,3.6
8019690,5,B00020W0WO,I got this dvd for my brother's 10th birthday party which was Tampa Bay Lightning themed. It's a great dvd we've watched it several times already and I also played it during the party which caused several kids to become glued to the tv! I love watching the Bolts win the cup hopefully they can do it again this year! GO BOLTS!!!!!!!,1306195200,,332,4.370967741935484
8019691,4,B00020W0WO,"I really liked the Game 7 piece.  Nice to see that.  The review of how they went from the 96 season to cellar-dwellers back to Champs was interesting.  Cool to see all the playoff action too.  I would have liked to see more of the Philly series.  That was a great series and worth having more video of that.  Too bad some of the Flames fans are still upset about the puck that didn't go in.  ""Almost"" goals don't count.  You gotta get the puck across the line, not partially.  No sour grapes in Lightning-Land though.  They were the better team though the Flames were a great team too.  Classic series.",1123545600,3,602,4.333333333333333
8019692,3,B00020W0WO,The Flames should have won it in Game 6 - Gelinas' goal was clearly in...brutally disappointing end to a great playoff run.  The DVD should have focused on the deserving Stanley Cup champions - that would be worth a lot more.,1109030400,2,225,4.487804878048781
8019693,5,B00020W0WO,"The most underrated professional sport in America today, this DVD shows just how much heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears players put into hockey.  This DVD, showing the Cinderella-esque run that the Tampa Bay Lightning made on their road to Stanley Cup victory, shows just that.  Any NHL or Lightning fan will remember how just a few years ago the Lightning were the laughing stock of the entire NHL.  For a few years straight they were the worst team in the league, and instead of going over budget and signing big name players (they couldn't if they wanted to however, since not much cash had been put into the team) they built their championship foundation through the draft and trades like historic teams such as the Colorado Avalanche and New Jersey Devils had done in years past.  Martin St. Louis.  Brad Richards.  Vincent Lecavalier.  Dave Andreychuk.  Nikolai Khabibulen.  These are just a few players who catapaulted the Lightning to success during the regular season, and managed to topple over the Calgary Flames in their dramatic Game seven victory.  This DVD is an absolute must own for Lightning fans or NHL fans in general, and it's about the only NHL action we fans will be seeing for a while with the Lockout in full effect, and a sad uncertainty whether or not the NHL will ever be again.",1099180800,8,1309,4.726872246696035
8019694,5,B00020W0WO,"It is always good to know what you are talking about when watching hockey!  In the 7 years being a season ticket holder for the Bolts, I have watched some awful teams.  In the last 3 years they started looking different on the ice.  This DVD provides what I have seen for those past years.  The togetherness, the work ethic to do the job asked of them.  Everytime ANY of this team was/is interviewed, they say the exact same thing about working as a team, about skating hard and believing in each other.  These boys got the same book and were on the same page the entire season.  The extra stuff shows the things we knew were going on but were afraid to ask.

This team had fun this year and because it was fun they learned to win and move on to the next game if they lost.  I still get chills hearing the radio call, hearing the announcers at the end of the game on the TV highlights and watching this video.  It was AWESOME to be there and is still very cool!  (no pun intended)

Lillis: NO ONE can know the real truth about that goal.  Camera angles on that one were not great and definitely not conclusive.",1098489600,5,1110,4.203791469194313
8019695,4,B00020W0WO,"I don't like to sound immodest, or like I'm bragging, but I know more about ice hockey than most people. I proved it this year and about 2 years ago when i told all my hockey fan acquaintances to ""watch this team-they're gonna be good"".

One of the advantages of having digital satellite TV and the NHL Center Ice package, is being able to watch games from all over the league, and I hooked onto the Bolts about three years ago when they were still lousy. But I saw a couple of games they played against the Islanders (of all teams), with whom they had a nasty bottom-of-the-barrel rivalry at the time, and for some reason a ""Bolt"" out of the blue told me that this was a team to watch. St. Louis was just coming into his own (and suffered a broken leg that year to end his season.) I knew their coach Tortorella from when he was an assistant with the Rangers, and had been impressed with him when he had a very brief (4 games) stint as an interim coach at the end of one year and lit into the fat cat Rangers for quitting cold on him, the rest of the coaching staff, the previous coach and the fans. After one particular interview, in which he made the harshest comments I've ever heard any coach make about his own team, I said to myself ""This guy is gonna be a good coach"". I've watched just about all their games the last three years and could see them coming and coming.

At the beginning of last year, when just sitting around talking hockey, a couple of folks asked me who I thought was gonna win the cup, I said ""Tampa Bay--if they stay healthy and get the goaltending"". This sounds like hindsight, but I said it and meant it, though the other experts I was talking to thought I was crazy.

The finals this year were hard fought, but until the last two games, they weren't great hockey. Before the series, everyone thought the hockey would be high flying, fast skating stuff, but Calgary cheesed out and clutched and grabbed and tripped and held and played tough but yellow-- until the last two games when they seemed to get a little gassed and the Bolts were able to play their game. Of course they won both games--by scores closer than they should have been. But winning is what counts.

This DVD is valuable because it contains the entire broadcast of the last game, and that's the reason I bought it. All the other stuff is nice but extraneous. I guess  music videos are a necessary evil in current sports highlights packages, but I find them very annoying. Of course with the miracle of DVD technology, you can easily skip them, which is what I reccomend. Otherwise a good buy for us hockey fans--especially since taped highlights may be the only hockey we see this year.",1094428800,3,2684,4.381526104417671
8019696,2,B00020W0WO,The DVD is a good one....BUT THE FLAMES SHOULD HAVE WON THE CUP IN GAME 6! THE PUCK CROSSED THE LINE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE WON THAT GAME! THE LIGHTINING GOT HANDED THE CUP BY THE NHL OFFICES IN TORONTO BY NOT REVIEWING THAT!,1090713600,,223,4.090909090909091
