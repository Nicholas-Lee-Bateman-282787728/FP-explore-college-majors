8306450,5,B001GP5TOU,"I'm not exactly a Patriots fan, but I collect these ""Greatest Games"" sets. The reason you have to pay a hundred grand for this set is because it was never officially released in the first place. If you're old enough to know what I'm talking about, this is equivalent to the Blank figure from the Dick Tracy toy line. It practically doesn't exist. If you're got 1/10th of a million dollars to blow, go for it. Otherwise, just watch the highlights on YouTube.

Rated 5 stars for what could have been a great set. Oh well.",1388448000,,519,4.40625
8306451,1,B001GP5TOU,"That's bull that this is 100,000!! I want this really bad but really for DVDs???? I love the pats but come on man!! Amazon should put a limit on how much you can sell stuff for!",1382832000,2,177,3.9444444444444446
8306452,3,B001GP5TOU,"It's a great idea that the NFL is putting out these ""Greatest Games"" sets but I wish they weren't so formulaic in their approach to selecting the games.  I'd expect most Patriots fans will already own 90% of these games since purchasing the great ""3 Games to Glory"" sets that came out after each Super Bowl victory, so it's just redundant.  There is just no reason at all for me to purchase this.
  I understand that to the National audience the Patriots' history begins with Brady and 2001.  That's okay if that's who they are marketing this for.  But I'd expect a good deal more sales success if it were meant for Patriots fans who want the NFL to dig a little deeper into the vaults.  The games against the Raiders and Miami leading to Super Bowl XX and the games with the Steelers and the Jags which lead to Super Bowl XXXI would have been brilliant choices as would anything from the excellent Glogan-led 1976 team (heck, I'd even take the playoff loss to Oakland).  But it seems, much like with the MLB, if you didn't win the Super Bowl the NFL just simply does not care (or thinks the fans care).
  Too bad.",1228521600,12,1114,4.390243902439025
8306453,2,B001GP5TOU,"Yeah, the Pats won 3 Super Bowls this decade and almost went undefeated last year. But there are plenty of great games before this decade. I'm only 23 but I know there's some good games from the 85 season. Then of course there were a lot of great games during the Bledsoe era in the 90s. Such as his signature game on 11/13/94 when he led the comeback with NFL record 45 completetions and 70 attempts against the Vikings, to start a 7 game winning streak into the playoffs. There were a lot of fun games from the 96 season when the Pats went to the Super Bowl against Green Bay. Then of course the return of Parcells in 1997 against the Jets. And the two comeback games in 1998 by Bledsoe with the broken finger against the Dolphins & Bills. If they really wanted to have all 10 of these Brady era games. They should have a 2nd disc with 10 great games in the pre-Brady era.",1226880000,4,874,4.208333333333333

8306455,5,B001GP5TOU,"I wish this set were coming out before Christmas.  It will be great reliving the Patriots' Super Bowl winning postseasons.  The ""Snow Plow Game"" would have been nice but the absence of pre dynasty era games won't even come close to discouraging me from picking this up the day it comes out.",1224892800,,290,4.5576923076923075
8306456,3,B001GP5TOU,"The Patriots were founded by Billy Sullivan in 1960 right? So why does this history of the Pats begin in 2001? Yeah it's true there were many failures pre-Belichick but also many terrific and entertaining games from 1960-2000, so why aren't any of them included on here?",1224633600,3,270,4.76595744680851
8306457,5,B001GP5TOU,"I hate the patriots, but I'm not here to put them down. This set should include the 85 playoff game vs. the Miami Dolphins. Not that it's a great game as the Dolphins lose, but that's classic Dan Marino material and this series has yet to issue a Dolphins greatest games set. So far, only the Chicago Bears 85 collection has any Dolphins film, and thankfully that one was a win for Miami. No longer than the Titans have been in existence, they have a greastest games set. Personally, I collect all of these sets because despite the unevenness in the series, it's cool to me that the NFL is finally making classic/postseason games available through retail. Beside, don't people have enough in Boston during the last 7 years to hold them over? I hate the patriots.",1224288000,4,762,4.569343065693431
8306458,5,B001GP5TOU,I am a hardcore New England Patriots fan and I have to say in seeing the back cover for what games will be included I remember every game and I can honestly say that I don't disagree any of the games I just would have liked to see the perfect regular season game with the Giants and the Monday Night comeback vs. the Ravens but they weren't as memorable.  GO PATS!  This does not include this year's AFC Title game in Foxborough but the 2007 divsional playoff game where New England went into San Diego as underdogs,1223683200,6,515,4.298969072164948
8306459,1,B001GP5TOU,I'm assuing 3 games will be their Super Bowl victories.  The other 7 games???  AFC championship victories over Colts??? Any games from the Steve Grogen era???,1223424000,2,158,5.038461538461538
