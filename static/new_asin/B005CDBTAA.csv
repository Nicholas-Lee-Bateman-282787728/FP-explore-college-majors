4652551,5,B005CDBTAA,"Most of the time a documentary does not live up to its great reviews and being a Robert Johnson fan since the 1960's, it was with caution that I recently purchased CAN'T YOU HEAR THE WIND HOWL? THE LIFE & MUSIC OF ROBERT JOHNSON CENTENNIAL SPECIAL EDITION, and I was extremely happy to find out it does!  With just two photographs of Robert Johnson to work with, director Peter Meyer weaves Johnson's story with interviews, vintage film footage and black and white re-creations, which I usually don't like, but I'm happy to say, they work in this film.  The re-creations ring with authenticity and Keb' Mo' makes us believe we're actually watching Robert Johnson.  This CENTENNIAL SPECIAL EDITION includes Special Feature interview outtakes with the two bluesmen that played with Johnson -- the late great Johnny Shines and the recently deceased Honeyboy Edwards.  These interviews were done in 1990 and Shines' interview, in particular, is an important and revealing portrait of a bluesman on the road in the 1930's.  Meyer's interviews in general are relaxed and are not canned responses to his questions.  Meyer also utilizes 24 original Johnson recordings in the soundtrack, so I highly recommend this documentary as a must have for any music fan and a perfect introduction to this legendary musician.",1316995200,19,1305,5.046511627906977

Amazing man. No matter how far he traveled or what he did, he was always as fresh as a flower after a shower. How did he stay so clean and wrinkle free? Must have been part of the magic.",1474761600,2,337,4.184615384615385

4652582,4,B005CDBTAA,"While this is a must, I do need to say that I think it could be better.  Some of the narration is cheesy and it just could have been done a little better all the way around.
That said, I don't think there is anything better out there.  Great info, great story, just not the best execution.",1400025600,,289,4.052631578947368
4652583,4,B005CDBTAA,"A possessed man determined to find his own way with absolutely no fear in regards to traveling in an environment of hate, bigotry & segregation in order to find or play at his next gig. Loved the interviews with fellow musicians still alive at the time of the filming. Truly a unique talented icon in the world of the blues.

4652584,5,B005CDBTAA,"A very nice presentation and dramatization of the life of Robert Johnson, or at least what we know of it. I was fascinated with the information and the music and the story behind it. I'm not sure having Keith Richards and Eric Clapton clips added anything to this, but it didn't hurt. Very nice documentary for the blues fan to watch.",1394496000,,334,4.491803278688525

4652586,4,B005CDBTAA,"The documentary includes interviews with people who actually knew, worked with and lived with Robert Johnson. Most notably among them a man named Johnny Shines who worked the South with Johnson, moving from city to city, playing street corner gigs and their first concert with a big crowd in Chicago. He comes across as utterly sincere and grounded, his perceptions of Johnson seem accurate and unaffected and his description of Jonson creates a picture of a man determined to make a living other than busting his hump in the fields. Given repeated descriptions of Johnson's slender, stretchy fingers this somehow seems unsurprising. The descriptions of Johnson stretching wire on a household wall to better understand the nature of rythmn, tempo and harmony also ring true. The most poignant and telling part of the narrative for me were the parts where Johnson is depicted walking by the side of the road, carrying his guitar, far from anyplace he could call home. If this isn't the birth of the blues, it's hard to imagine another.",1370649600,5,1034,4.982658959537572
4652587,5,B005CDBTAA,"I have been looking for decent documentaries to learn more about the history of Blues.  This is a neat one as it mixes photographs, reenactments with Keb Mo as Robert Johnson (awesome choice) and gives a great timeline.  I didn't realize so much was known about his life and I was surprised by a number of things from his life.  Well worth the price and its entertaining.",1361491200,2,371,4.507462686567164
4652588,4,B005CDBTAA,"Ever wonder why people moon over Robert Johnson, but have the sneaking suspicion it's just hype?  This gives insight into what made him great, in both his personality, intellect and ability, and his guitar playing.  Johnny Shines really brings the time-period to light, in his interviews.  I can't really say whether Clapton and Richards are sincere or not.",1361145600,3,357,5.120689655172414

4652590,5,B005CDBTAA,"Having been familiar with the original DVD that came out in 1997, I found this 2011 CENTENNIAL SPECIAL EDITION re-edit with Johnny Shines and Honeyboy Edwards interview outtakes to be an even more valuable piece of musical history.  I'm glad to see this has been released again since I have been recommending it to friends for years and the only ones they could find were older copies with exorbitant prices.  This is still the best Robert Johnson documentary to ever be produced. Highly recommended!

8465135,4,B005CDBTAA,"Even by the standard of the DVD format this disc looks BAD, the resolution is poor, the aspect ratio is odd and there's a persistent vertical white line on the far right of the  image. This desperately needs a blu-ray re-release .... BUT:

This is a superb documentary that tells the known life story of Mr Johnson with many interviews of people who (probably) knew him and truly mesmerising re-enactments employing an actor as Johnson who looks amazingly like him right down to the fingers!

I highly recommend this if no better version becomes available but this one looks far worse than it should.",1514592000,,600,4.75
8465136,4,B005CDBTAA,"Excellent documentary on the life of Robert Johnson.  At the time of this filming, some of the people who actually knew (and played with) RJ were still alive.  Those interviews make this movie worth seeing.  It's a piece of history which would be lost except through this movie.  Considering the lack of source material (no actual film footage of RJ exists and precious few photos) the film-makers did the best they could with what they had.  They used re-enactments to fill-in some of the gaps.  RJ is a national treasure and it's good to see an accurate portrayal of his life and times.

How would you ever understand and tell of feelings that require - demand - cloaked metaphors in your personal language, lest the rawness of life rob you of life?

Robert Johnson's remarkable life WAS the blues with all its sorrows. He remains an important person to this music. Well done.",1508544000,,409,4.527027027027027
