8412062,1,B001OUPW6M,"I did not purchase my copy from or through Amazon, but this is the exact same version of the complete Outlaw Star set that I bought from another website.
Same cover art.
Same # of discs (3).
It is Region 0 (playable anywhere)
Has NO overview, notation, credits, license logos on the back.
The latter 2 of the 3 discs glitch out for the duration of several episodes.
Not to mention the fact that the second disc was scratched, being loose in the case during shipping (etc.), despite a very strong tab in the 2nd disc retainer, which should have prevented this.
Oh, and the 1st disc retainer was just so damaged as to fall apart when I took the disc out, but didn't damage the disc.
1st & 3rd: flawless, 2nd: damaged.

I'm seeing a pattern that tells me these items were handled by not-so-skilled hands before (and possibly after, to replace & re-sell) being shrink-wrapped... and apparently any jerk with a bootlegging operation can figure out how to shrink-wrap.

To wrap this up: look for the black or red-orange boxsets if you're interested in INDUSTRY QUALITY. More than 3 discs, etc.

However if you're cheap & willing to risk it, you can find this bootleg for far less than the 3rd party is selling it for on here. Google it.",1347321600,,1230,4.531531531531532
