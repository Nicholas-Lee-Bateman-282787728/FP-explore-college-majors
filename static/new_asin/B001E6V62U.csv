8582601,1,B001E6V62U,"While this DVD starts out well it is less than 30 minutes long and only touches on the most basic themes.  There is very little detail or in-depth exploration of the causes of the war other than the obvious.  The same segment repeats again and again on the DVD.  I am not sure what the purpose of this DVD really is -- schoolroom use?

Skip this one and buy the two ""classics"":  the CBS ""The Complete Story of World War I"" narrated by Robert Ryan and the UK Channel 4 ""The First World War"" narrated by Jonathan Lewis.",1235606400,,517,4.23469387755102
