8359147,2,B000YY8NC4,"A fairly decent film from Mexico concerning a family mixed between the USA and Mexico.  The children rebel against their parents and the beautiful lead actress played by the lovely Leticia Pinto gets involved in a sexual relationship with a white American.  Oh the humanity!  What will become of her?  Anyway, it's a decent watch HOWEVER this is a Mexican DVD company, which means the image quality is bad, it isn't remastered and of-course it's a censored version of the film.  Welcome to the tragic Mexican DVD market. The worst on earth.",1217548800,2,540,4.826086956521739
8359148,4,B000YY8NC4,"""Los Desarraigados"" loosely translates to ""The Rootless"".  That is what happens to the sons and daughter of Mexican parents who were raised in the United States.  They are kind of confused about their cultural identity, especially the girl.
  The film basically evolves around the culture-clash between parents and sons/daughters. The father, in a way, is sorry to have left his hometown,Mexico, while his daughter wants to deny all her heritage/background saying that she will marry this white man.
  The daughter wants to run away from home, but eventually returns because her boyfriend was just taking advantage of her and told her that she was just ""his b#@ch"". I really enjoyed the story and the film, not only because of the theme/subject that was involved,but because it was mostly filmed where I am originally from, Brownsville, Texas.

In my opinion, the story was well told and explores the feelings and conflicts of the family members. It can be said that there is a lot of tragedy.

  The story is good, eventhough the movie is kind of cheesy. The DVD, I believe, edited/erased the part where the girl is running naked on the beach.  This scene can be seen on VHS.",1212624000,,1176,4.85929648241206
