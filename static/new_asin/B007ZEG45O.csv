8523400,1,B007ZEG45O,"I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, but it was truly awful!  The worst part was that the only part of the ""shrunken city"" that we actually see is some room where this goofy old guy instructs the kids on how to save his city.  Most of the film takes place in the real world where the kids are just running from this group of goofball aliens that want to take over the shrunken city for energy use.  The bad-guy 'aliens"" are lizard creatures (low-budget make-up) and can disguise themselves as humans. It's obvious that the budget for this film was in the low thousands of dollars.  Enough to pay the cast and a few cheap sets and costumes.  Avoid at all costs.",1417392000,3,662,4.349593495934959
