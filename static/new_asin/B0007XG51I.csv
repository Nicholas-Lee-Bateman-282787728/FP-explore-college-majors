2248783,4,B0007XG51I,"This movie took me by surprise. I'll start of by saying this movie isn't for everybody. I did an IMDb search and it listed the budget as $10,000. You read that right. To be fair, it looks better than the budget suggests. This clearly isn't a couple of kids running around with a camcorder, but if you're expecting polished production values, perfect special effects and Oscar caliber acting, you might want to rent something else.

That said, Rise of the Undead is a unique piece of work, despite what the generic title might suggest. For one thing, nothing is ever explained! This was a refreshing change of pace for me. I've always been annoyed by horror movies that feel the need to explain everything. The eerie monster that has been sending shivers down your spine since the start of the movie is revealed to be a mutant hamster from Mars, and suddenly you don't care any more.

This movie starts off with what appears to be some sort of apocalyptic firestorm (depicted using low-rent but serviceable CG). Is this an atomic bomb? ID4 aliens invading? Dresden Redux? Who the heck knows? Certainly not the audience, and who cares? Then our (mostly nameless) characters, who have run into some sort of storage facility or something to escape, start being hunted by a creature that we never see at first. What is this creature? We never find out. We see it in flashes (Literally. From a Polaroid camera that seems to appear in one character's hands from nowhere.). It's just there.

Then there's the titular undead. They are given the film's sole piece of exposition (their origins), and... guess what. It's utter bull. The explanation of the zombies is a complete red herring! Nothing is explained.

Add to that a sub-plot involving a sex-obsessed psychopath and you have a pretty bizarre movie. I won't say that I get it exactly, or even that there's anything to get at all. Rise of the Undead seems to be an exercise in extreme minimalism, and because of that it really intrigued me. If you can get past the rough edges (as well as wade through the dull first 30 minutes or so) you might be pleasantly surprised.

Plus, it boasts a steadycam shot where the camera goes into a guy's chest and shoots out the other side in an explosion of blood. Cool.",1117584000,9,2253,4.650753768844221
2248784,5,B0007XG51I,"I personally loved this film...it is low budget, and you know that going in...so don't complain about it...imagine how hard it is to make a film and sit back and enjoy the fun they had making it...it's pretty trippy and different than most ""horror films."" It has an obscure philosophy and subtext which i found intelligent and refreshing in this genre. And the score is fantastic...whoever did some of those weird sounds is a genius. All in all, i recommend this as a great first film to watch by a talented and up and coming production company!!! thanks guys!",1116979200,8,560,4.666666666666667
2248785,4,B0007XG51I,"This is definately not a zombie movie. Well sort of. I'm a huge zombie movie fan. I bought this movie because I thought it was an all out Zombie fest. It's really not. The entire middle section of the movie does involve zombies, but I won't be as crass as to divulge how.

My intial reaction was anger. How dare they sell this as a zombie flick when it's not. But after some reflection, I began to mellow. It's not a bad movie. Sure  it's cheap. And some of the effects and performances are laughable.

But, this is a movie that tries to reach beyond the standard. It is going for something more thoughtful and creative than just straight out horror. The set up is awesome, the dialouge has a natural improvised feel to it (i'm sure some of it was), the turns some of the characters take are interesting and unpredictable, the music is pretty cool, although some of the score is cheesy.  There are problems. We don't really get to know most of the characters very well, some of the action is a bit awkwardly staged, and the scene transitions are weird.

I looked up the movie on imdb and this is the directors' first movie. I can't wait to see what they do next. Hopefully they'll get a bigger budget.

I would normally rate this a 3, but being a low budget filmmaker myself, I know how hard it is to get something out there for no money. and these guys did it. congrads.",1116460800,9,1371,4.315175097276264
2248786,1,B0007XG51I,"I would warn you about the spoilers to follow but there is nothing at all to spoil. This movie is low cost which I don't mind. I don't mind bad acting. What I do mind is the only undead in this pitiful excuse of a movie are in some guys dream. Thats right! Everyone gets killed but like wow man it was only a dream. But worst of all, they wind up fighting a light monster. Thats right you heard it here first. A light monster. Movie sucks, sucks, sucks. These actors actuallly got cheated.  A good script and this setting would have worked well. Movie sucked.",1116288000,5,559,4.224299065420561
2248787,4,B0007XG51I,"This movie was not bad atll and i actually enjoyed it. It is an extremely lowbudget movie, but worth the purchase. Its a shame with a budget this movie could have been a ton better, but for what it is its definitly cool. a movie low budget zombie fans would definitly find cool. Just to let everyone know, i personally love a good gory zombie movie. Now in this flick they don't show any of the killing just the squirting of blood,but for the budget they had they probably couldn't afford to get into to much detail. Like i said overall a cool movie. I enjoyed it.",1115424000,8,564,4.280373831775701
2248788,4,B0007XG51I,"This movie started out kind of slow but once it kicked into gear, the action kept the movie entertaining.  How can you go wrong with school girls and zombies?  Low budget horror fans will love this movie.",1113782400,9,204,4.486486486486487
8053505,1,B0007XG51I,"A group of people hold up in what looks like a storage unit building while the city is in an infernal and zombies are roaming around. The film had a list of bads that include: acting, sound, camera angles, dialogue, and script. Chantal Koerner was annoying.

8053506,1,B0007XG51I,"AS a supporter of independent movies and a film maker myself, all I can say is WTF. There too many plots going on, It didn't explain what the main plot of the movie. The characters were there,but, they didn't explore them and they acted like they were lost and looking for direction. Also the ending is just as confusing as the rest of the movie. Please, at all cost, avoid this movie. It is not worth your time or money.",1240272000,,421,4.275
8053507,1,B0007XG51I,"I bought this movie the other week from a local movie and music store. I even got it used for under 10 bucks. From the cover and the writeup on the back, it is obviously a low budget movie(listing as a B movie would be much to generous). I have been a fan of many low budget zombie movies like The Dead Next Door, House of the Dead 2, and Severed. However this movie is not even redeemable as being cast in the Low Budget light. Horrible acting, non-exsistent gore of any kind, and a story that jumps around so much, you can't follow it very easily.
I will break it down. First the acting in this movie could be generously compared to a high school production. The actors seem to have not rehearsed there scenes at all. It appears to me that much of the dialogue is ad-libbed. The sole redeeming point of the acting cast is the attractive blonde that plays the school aged girl. She is obviously much older than the school aged girl she plays, but she has a fantastic scream that would make itself home in a slasher movie.
On to special effects...There are little to none. It appears the only special effects equipment they had at their disposal was a ketchup bottle. The only gore effects that are used throughout the movie are blood spurting on the walls, and poured on blood to simulate a wound. The only other effects used are cheesy computer effects. How you can make a zombie movie where all the attacks are shot out of camera is beyond me. The zombie genre is defined by these type of scenes. It would be like making a vampire movie and all the neck bites and blood sucking are shot at waist level.
Finally, the writing, directing, and the location. It is unfair to blame the actors solely. Much of it looks like they were poorly directed, with little vision to what the finished product will look like. The dialogue is delivered very unevenly, things that most directors would have called Cut and reshot the scene. In addition, this movie suffers from horrible writing. The writers have stolen the race oriented conflict between the 2 main male characters in Night of the Living Dead, and done it in a shoddy manner. If you are gonna steal ideas, do it in a respectable manner. The writing just has the characters running up and down the same corridor for much of the movie. This brings up the setting. It is suppose to some secret government research facility. So why are all these civilians inside the building? The movie actually is shot inside a Self Storage building, all to obvious by the large signs that ask people,""Did you remember to lock you unit?"" as well as others. The outside shots of the city in destruction looks like the graffics of a video game from the 1980s. These scenes aren't poor, they are embarrassing.
This movie might have passed for a college film project. It probably would have been graded a C at best. But this is not a college project, it is sold as a professionally made movie. As such, it fails at every level a low or no budget movie can fail. The best thing about this movie was the title. ""Rise of the Undead"" is a fantastic title for a zombie movie. Unfortuantly, it is attached to this horrible movie.",1190332800,,3149,4.459272097053726
8053508,1,B0007XG51I,"With so many zombie movies coming out, 90% should be avoided.  Low budget, camcorder feel to movie, and bad acting is what you see here.  At least the bad movies of the 80's had the eerie gritty 8mm look.  Good to cure insomnia but that is about all.",1188000000,,250,4.166666666666667
8053509,3,B0007XG51I,"Rise of the Undead was definately not a great movie. In fact, it failed in many respects. But you got to give it up to the kids for trying. The filmmakers here tried to make a big budget film for nothing. And I'm guessing they spent next to nothing on this. Instead of making a safe, visually restrictive film, they swung for the fences. Sure, they may have struck out, but at least they tried. And I'd bet good money that if they do make another film, it'll be much better. And I say that this is the kind of thing we need more of. Filmakers trying to stretch beyond their financial limitations.

The movie's major flaw was poor scripting. The set up was ok. It just needed better characterization. If the characters would've been more developed, it would've been easier to follow them through the crazy plot. I even got the feeling that given better dialog to work with the actors might have been ok. There was nothing there that couldn't have been tightened up with another draft of the script.

I think they stayed away from the wide shots, but not for creative reasons. The over use of close up is one of the most disturbing trends of the last few decades of cinema. Back in the heyday of film, directors used close ups sparingly and to great effect. Today, they're used way too often. It's most likely the influence of T.V. It's refreshing to see a director let the camera just stay back. (although the shots should sometimes move and be dynamic) That being said, the director of Rise of the Undead should've shot the movie in closer shots. Not because close ups work better, but because DV looks crappy in wides.

The major problem with the way it was shot, was there wasn't much variety in the shots. They weren't very dynamic. It seemed they covered many of the scenes from 1 or two angles, with little or no camera movement. It gave everything a static, stale feel (especial in the first 30 minutes of the film. The second half was shot a little better, although some of it was a little too dark.

It sounds like I liked this movie. Well... I think it was good attempt. And with a better script, and a little more thought, I think the director might have something to offer.",1128297600,9,2184,4.438902743142145
8053510,3,B0007XG51I,"Independent, low budget, micro-budget, no budget, backyard film; these are all fancy terms to say ""we had no money, but shot a movie anyway"".

Rise of the Undead is one of these films. And thank god they exist.

It may not be the most technically savvy of movies, but who really cares about that. Rise and other films like it throw the conventions of traditional movie making and story telling out the window, and do things they way they want. A story like this never would have got past studio heads.

They never explain what the monster is, or how the apocalypse started. There is no clear cut hero or main character. The characters seem to be simply different parts of a single psyche.

If you can't get past  cheap production values and traditional stories told in a non-traditional manner, then Rise probably isn't for you.",1120867200,15,828,4.6438356164383565
8053511,3,B0007XG51I,"This was a good horror movie. I've seen it accused of not making sense in one of the other reviews. They must not have actually been paying attention, because the movie makes perfect sense.

The CGIs were cheesy, the acting was terrible, and so was the editing and the sound. If you don't have the money for descent CGI, just don't do it. I don't understand people giving this movie 4 and 5 stars, they must have worked on the movie or know people that did.
