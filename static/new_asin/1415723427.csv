175532,5,1415723427,"This show is a hoot! The stories move along at a fast pace and so does the banter between the main characters. For me, character development is everything - I buy into these wonderful performances completely. Pay attention or you'll lose out on the wonderfully quick dialog. Clearly, one the best shows on television.

Suggestion: the production company should include subtitles with future NCIS  releases.",1161907200,27,406,5.230769230769231
175533,4,1415723427,"Thia series' first season has some hits and some misses, but overall this CSI/WITHOUT A TRACE companion is entertaining and has offered some interesting, if oftentimes, confusing plotlines.  The series focuses on a special team of agents who investigate various crimes under the umbrella of the Navy/Marine Corps.  Mark Harmon heads up the team as Jethro Gibbs; Sasha Alexander is Kaitlin Todd; Michael Weatherly is Tony Dinosio; Pauley Perrette is forencisc expert Abby; David McCallum is medical examiner Duckie; and Sean Murray is Magee.  Crimes range from terrorists to murders to kidnapping and gun running.  Most episodes move quickly, although there are some distractions such as the annoying music that almost always accompanies Abby's scenes; McCallum's constant trivia and storytelling have become redundant and annoying; and the constant sexual bantering between Weatherly and Alexander is overused.  While all the performances are very good, especially Perrette and McCallum, Mark Harmon's character is so unlikeable at times, you wanna punch him.  Hopefully, they'll infuse him with a little more positive personality in the seasons to come.  I don't find it as good as CSI or WITHOUT A TRACE, but I look forward to more episodes.",1156723200,9,1243,5.409326424870466
175534,5,1415723427,"When I first heard of NCIS, my immediate reaction was, ""Oh no, not another investigative show!"" Programs such as CSI, Cold Case, and Without a Trace have never impressed me; I find many of the characters bland, and though the cases themselves may be good, it's a show's cast that sells it for me.

Luckily, NCIS does the opposite: the formula comprises of characters first, crime second, and the show is embedded with such wit and humor that it's hard not to like it. The cast includes sarcastic Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon); ladies-man Tony DiNozzo (the highly attractive Michael Weatherly); witty Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander) to provide amusing banter with Tony; goth Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette); and M.E. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum), who has a passion for storytelling. Season two also adds probational officer (""probie"") Tim McGee (played by Sean Murray) as a new agent to the team. (McGee guest starred in a number of episodes in season one as well.)

NCIS is a combination of comedy and drama, and if you like either of the above, you will most likely love NCIS. It's a shame that this show has only just begun to become popular; it deserves far more attention and praise than it has received so far.",1154390400,73,1223,4.791469194312796

175595,5,1415723427,"When the final episode of NCIS Season 1 aired in May 2004, this CBS police procedural had firmly established itself as one of my all-time favorite shows. With its superb cast and intelligently written, suspenseful episodes, it was one of only a very few shows that I would make time to watch every week.

NCIS  Season 2, which premiered in September 2004, no longer has the word Navy in its title. It's every bit as good as the season before. Once again, viewers are transported to the Washington Navy Yard headquarters of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).  Here, Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and his crack team of special agents Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), and Probie Tim McGee (Sean Murray) tackle a series of Navy and Marine Corps-related criminal cases that certainly challenge every one of their investigative and deductive skills. They are ably assisted by forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) and Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Donald Ducky Mallard (David McCallum).

Among NCIS Season 2s twenty-three episodes are several that are my personal favorites. In The Bone Yard, Gibbss team investigates the discovery of some human remains in a Navy aircraft bombing range, where the local mob appears to be dumping the bodies of its murder victims. In Call of Silence, an elderly Medal of Honor recipient confesses to Gibbs that he murdered a fellow Marine during the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. In Doppelganger, Gibbs and his agents join forces with a local team of police detectives, all of whom curiously mirror each NCIS agents personality traits. In the seasons final two episodes, Gibbs and the team must confront murderous Mossad agent Ari Haswari in a final showdown that has tragic consequences for everyone

These and every other episode of NCIS  Season 2 contain a nice blend of comedy, drama, and suspense, and all of them maintain the very high standards of excellence established in Season 1. Highly recommended.",1472428800,,2005,5.079027355623101

I have enjoyed watching all the Seasons and each episode in the right sequence to see how the directors and writers developed this fantastic TV Series. This TV Series has been one of my most favorite and enjoyable one to watch. The extra features on the DVDs have provided me with a tremendous understanding of how the TV Series was developed, written, and performed by a wonderful ensemble of great actors. The only other TV Series that matches the ""magic"" with this show is the Big Bang Theory. Both a credit to the producers and the wonderful and talented actors.",1427932800,,642,4.495726495726496

175773,5,1415723427,"NCIS episode was great, as always. What wasn't great was that I found that Amazon movies don't work using Chromecast, and I was very disappointed about that. I had the Amazon header and footer on my TV, but the movie didn't show on my TV screen. Fast forward to the next day - I did a lot of research on Internet, and found the key. I had to inactivate Silverlight which made Flash work. I did get the epiisode on my screen, but as I had read, the screen image hesitated and this was not acceptable. When I got Chromecast nowhere did it say that it wouldn't work properly with movies from Amazon. I also read that Amazon could make this work, but chooses not to. Probably because they have their own version of Chromecast to sell. I hate it when that happens. Boo.",1420156800,2,764,4.3125

175851,4,1415723427,"First of all, understand that I am not the most enthusiastic TV series viewer.  I spent much of my adult life without watching any television and only recently began to watch TV regularly - mostly in response to very dark and very cold Alaskan windows.  So, take what I say with that in mind.

I stumbled across NCIS during the 2014 season; intrigued, I bought Season 1 and I enjoyed it. There are two episodes in Season 2 that I have really enjoyed, Doppleganger (the parallel team idea was very entertaining), Chained (giving good play time to DiNozzo), and Witness (show casing McGee).  Lt Jane Doe also was well thought out with few dangling plot devices.

But I am finding some things I don't like in Season 2 that are either a product of different writing or something about the game plan I didn't notice before.  Tony and Caitlin, especially, come off as stupid, when Gibbs always knows the score, for example.  Sasha Alexander's character is frequently reduced to nothing but snide comments on Tony much of the time (no wonder she wanted out of her contract).  Then, there are the twist endings that aren't fully explained to my way of thinking.  For example, in the episode title, Black Water, a car was pulled from a lake with decomposing skeletons and a bullet hole lodged in the door.  The Twist at the end was the bullet hole was exposed to water for less time than the rest of the metal in the car.  Question - how did the perpetrator fire the bullet into the side of the car - haul the car out, fire the bullet, then let it roll back into the pond?  Did he somehow fire underwater?  You see my point.

But, having said that - I still like series.  Overall, I find it more entertaining than many and will probably keep buying the seasons right up to the most recent.  It is a comfortable way to spend an evening.",1405468800,2,1826,4.454819277108434

175875,5,1415723427,This was the season that led to the shocking death of Special Agent Kate which led to the opening for to bring in the Israeli Mousad agent Diveed (or whatever it's spelled.)

175923,5,1415723427,"The success of a program like ""West Wing"" depends upon the viewer's seeing the key players as a real team who know each other, care about each other, and work together in a real-world way. If the scripts are such that the actors cannot become that team, the show will fail, an event that almost took place on ""West Wing"" after Season 4, when Aaron Sorkin, the vision and writer of the show, left. A group of new writers with almost no history of participation in the show produced some scripts that nearly tore the original vision apart.

Happily, the vision, the team, and the excitement are at their best in Season 2, with the 2-part opener that not only deals with the attempted assassination of the president in the present, and how the team was formed in vignettes from the past. The shows only get better as the season progresses. (It is personally interesting to note the subtle differences between Seasons 2 and 3. It was before Season 3 began that the terrible events of 9-11 took place. After 9-11, the show became subtly different.)

The DVDs themselves are excellent in quality, although trying to read the minuscule print that identifies which season and which side of the DVD one wants is difficult unless you have the vision of a hawk! I bought the set because I wore out my first set. The only flaw  in the packaging is that all the DVDs open up like an accordion fold, which makes them much harder to handle. I wish they could have done them as they did for Seasons 4 and following: put the set into book form, so it is easier to handle.",1376784000,,1554,4.464788732394366

They don't dwell on the charactors private lives except as it pertains to a particular episode.  The characters all work as a team instead of ""hiding info, etc"" from other team members.

What I resent is having to pay for the site and then paying $1.99 to watch each show.  Sure, I 'own' the show then but I would prefer an option of no charge renting or a fee for buying. I don't know if CBS requires it be Fee TV or Amazon but I feel that once it goes to Amazon or Netflix or anything else like that, the shows should always have a choice of it being of no charge.

This season is solid all the way through, from the opening episode where they are called to rescue a Captain being held hostage by a maniac on his computer. But there's a twist at the end, that even Gibbs doesn't see coming. Now NCIS did a fantastic job in season one, by introducing Ari. And just when you think the last time they saw him was when Gibbs shot him in the shoulder. Now unfortunately, Sasha Alexander thought this was the perfect opportunity to leave NCIS. And so, at the end of season 2, Kate gets killed by Ari. And thus, the first cliff hanger ending a season of NCIS.

The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice.  The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.,1342137600,,811,4.232258064516129

When i played it however, ALL the dvds in the season skipped the first chapter of each show. I had to try a few times to contact the seller and never heard anything back until after i reported him to amazon. he was polite about the whole thing and said sorry that they didn't work but that he cant exchange it b/c he was out of stock and that he would refund the money and asked that i just throw out the set.

Charles Durning, who has distinguished himself in his profession, is also a WWII hero, winning the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action - and 3 Purple Hearts for wounds.  Here he gives a lovely, lyrical, and nuanced performance as a aging and confused hero tortured by his past.  It is a quietly acted tour de force - watch the old guy show the young actors who it's really done!  Watch carefully for the scene where his Medal of Honor is revealed to the officer and guards who have come to arrest him.

 If you're a big fan like me, you'll love the extras and commentaries. I especially like the interviews with Don Bellisario, the show's first producer.
 The second season gave fans more background into the main characters, showing you can have a crime show with characters, instead of being just about crime and procedures as so many of them are.",1295913600,,532,4.474226804123711

176075,5,1415723427,"I loved the first two seasons of NCIS.  It took me a long time to warm up to Ziva in the third season.  Perhaps this was because Kate was one of my favorite characters and also because Tony is not (the part is played VERY well, though) and to me, Ziva is a female Tony in many ways.  I still miss Kate, but I have learned to like Ziva better over time.  I still don't think much of the addition of Jenny in the third season (not that the actress doesn't do a good job, though) but enough about the third season.  Apparently, many people did not watch this show from the beginning since they don't seem to know that Kate was killed off on purpose because Sasha Alexander (the actress playing Kate) wanted off the show.  She felt that it was taking far more of her time than she had originally anticipated.  This was well publicized at the time.  But overall, if you liked Season One, you'll like Season Two.  It's a great series, with less of the kinky sex deaths than the ""CSI"" shows and more of how the crime is solved.  Abby is the only lovable ""goth"" I've ever encountered and I like Mark Harmon in just about everything I've ever seen him in.  The other characters added to them make a great ensemble.",1248739200,6,1205,4.26431718061674

The welcomed return of Gibbs! This is the BEST television series I have ever watched. Gibbs and his team are up to their usual antics in a slick, professional manner that leaves my favourite CSI in the shade, I am afraid.

The script is intelligent, the filming is fabulous, you are kept guessing with the plots and storyline. If you are a fan, hold onto your seat because this Season Two will thrill and excite you just as Season One did.

After watching this, just as I was, you will be rushing on-line to buy Season Three! I enjoy watching on dvd because I can sit and watch as many episodes as I want back to back.

They just never disappoint! Every single episode is as great as the last. What else can I say? You have GOT to see this!",1178928000,,996,5.4480519480519485

176130,5,1415723427,"I love NCIS. I was sorry to see Kate killed off last season, and normally anyone who replaces such a character would have a hard time filling the shoes, but Ziva is her own unique character. She is a tough girl role model. I get such a kick out of the way she butchers idioms. Abby is...well Abby. Everyone could use a friend like Abby.  McGee is not really the McGeek he is made out to be. I still can't believe Ducky was on The Man from U.N.C.L.E. He is a wealth of knowledge, a veritable walking encyclopedia. Tony is a predictable, yet loveable lech who grows on you over time. Gibbs is the kind of boss I could work for, slaps in the back of the head and all.  Direct, results oriented, tough guy with a sensitive core shrouded by a hard exterior. The Director (Holly) plays her role well too. So... what you have here is a well rounded cast of characters with plots that are entertaining.

176137,5,1415723427,"This is a show that continually surprises and pleases.  What Don Bellisario has created with this series defies genre at times.  It's either an action series with great humor (bawdy at times) or a comedy with action and mystery; all brought together by a wonderful ensemble...that gets turned over in ""Twilight"".

  But I digress.  What we see in Season 2 is the continued development of the characters; getting to know them a little more--seeing their quirks, and their little secrets.  We begin to see a little more of Mark Harmon's Gibbs--going beyond the coffee and his ex-wives, finding more of his backstory.  The relationship between Tony and Kate--the friendly rivalry that they have (Of course, Tony finding the picture in Florida of Kate in the wet t-shirt gets him even for his kissing the transvestite in Season 1...).  Bringing Sean Murray into the fold, and watching the subtleties as Tim McGee somehow combines his nerdiness with learning to work the field.  There's always Pauley Perrette's Abby--an absolute scream for her smarts and energy--and the great David McCallum's Ducky.  Plus, getting to meet Ducky's mother in ""The Meat Puzzle"" (Somehow, Nina Foch's line to Sasha Alexander--""Let me see your knickers""--is going to stick with me for a lot of the wrong reasons)was a treat.

  But the last two episodes--""SWAK"", and especially the magnificent ""Twilight""--shook the series.  ""SWAK"" sets up the possibility of mortality on the team; ""Twilight"" follows through.  The return of Rudolph Martin's unstable Mossad double agent, Ari Haswari, was always kept open through the second half of Season 1, and was brought back to the viewer's mind in ""An Eye For An Eye"".  But the death of Kate--stunning as it was--was a good precursor for setting up how Season 3 played out.

  If I were Bellisario and I wanted to change something in Season 2, I would have brought Jessica Steen's Paula Cassidy into play more.  The Guantanamo NCIS agent who left DiNozzo ""interested"" (All viewers at once--""WHAT WOMAN DOESN'T??!?"")should probably have seen more than one episode (""Heart Break"")--if only to watch Tony moon over her.

  As Season 1's finale led to the underlying tone and eventuality of Season 2, the finale of Season 2 led into how Season 3 played out.  But THAT's another story...",1169683200,6,2298,5.031830238726791

7795550,4,1415723427,"I bought several seasons of NCIS around the holidays to complete my collection, which has often focused on buying the current seasons before moving back to older seasons. This might explain why season two looks like an alien lifeform to me. The storytelling and the feel of the show in the earlier years feels darker and mysterious and theres an intimacy there that the later years don't have as strong. I think in particular of one episode where if Im recalling correctly, this priest kidnapps military personnel and chains them up in this secret room while he prepares them to be his perfect 1950s bride. That reminds me more of Criminal Minds than a contemporary NCIS episode.
This possibly has to do with the fact that Don Bellisario is still running the ship at this point. Without getting too much into the whole Bellisario vs. Harmon thing, you can definitely tell a difference between NCIS seasons. Not that either way to go is bad (although there is no shortage of opinions on the subject)

I really enjoyed what they did in the final couple of episodeswhere Tony gets the plague and the finale where Kate is killed because it subverted television expectations. The plague episode was very intimate, small budget where all the characters felt raw and vulnerable in different ways. And the finale was just cruel because we are so used to the good guys saving the day and we thought they had and then BANG. Talk about ripping at a viewers heart.

Theres also as always some interesting special features to remind viewers of season two, which for me is like stepping into a time capsule.",1524268800,,1593,4.726618705035971
