The plot is amusing without being really funny.  If you're in the mood, watching it is not a bad way to spend the evening.",1426636800,,285,4.529411764705882
8661142,4,B00KS8SV7I,"This 3 1/2 century old opera, with it's 3-hour length and and it's 23 individual characters is a bit difficult to absorb. It is done more as a recovery of an ancient treasure [what it really is], than as an ""opera comic"" for entertainment. It is well worth to see/hear especially if you know well the Greek myths. Here is the story for you, if you don't: King Tindereus's wife, Leda, gave life to four children: two twin boys [the Dioscury-s] and two girls, one of them is Helena [the beautiful, for whom later the Trojan War was fought]. Zeus, who turned himself into a Swan, was actually the father of two of the four kids, but noone knows which are semi-gods or mortals. [The opera has a prologe with the apple and the beauty of three Godesses, but this has no relation to the rest of the opera, only to the Trojan War].
The opera is then about the abduction of Helena by Theseus [a semigod], and then her seduction by Menelaus, the Spartan King. It's good to know that Helena, after some years, was again seduced by Paris and taken to Troy, after which the Greeks killed most Trojans and erased the city. There are references made in the opera to this future.

The production is simple, almost primitive. Crossdressing rules everything, so you will have fun trying to follow who is a girl or a boy, and why.  A bit like a Shakespeare-comedy of the same time, but overdone. The main singers are excellent, both Helena, the soprano and Menelaus, a fantastic castrato. The orchestra is quite good and the conductor keeps a good tempo. But the music is mostly repetitious: individual laments by everyone of the 23 characters, who are all in love with someone or other. The lyric duets are beautifully sang by Helena and Menelaus, and castrato is often in higher range then the soprano!

In conclusion: this is for cognoscenti. It is not for innocent entertainment.",1425081600,6,1864,4.591591591591592
8661143,5,B00KS8SV7I,"I usually get my opera fixes from CDs or, where possible, from live performances, so I'm fairly new to opera on DVD. But I was fortunate enough to see this 2013 production of Cavalli's 'Elena' live in Aix-en-Provence, and I thought I'd give this 2-disc set a go. So I hope readers will excuse any statements of the obvious about the DVD medium in the following comments.

First of all, the music is fabulous, with Cavalli's infinitely flexible merging sequences of scene-setting instrumental preludes, recitative, arioso and aria, not necessarily in that order, proving ideally responsive to this convoluted tale of romance and adventure and to the motley characters involved. The plot is already well explained by fellow writers Keris Nine and Abert in their excellent reviews, so I will just add a few brief comments on the storyline here. Put simply, it concerns the wooing of Helen of Sparta, long before she became Helen of Troy, by the Greek Menelaus; but all the usual baroque opera elements are here, including true love, tenderness, lust, treachery, disguise, mistaken identity, false accusations, fury, revenge, murderous scheming, repentance and reconciliation. There's also a consistent element of cross-dressing in the main plot, not only essential to the main storyline but also offering ample opportunities for comedy. This involves Menelaus, having fallen in love with the beautiful Elena, cunningly dressing up as a woman, Elisa, in order to befriend her; but the disguise is so successful that various male characters who are not already in love with Helen, are soon fancying Elisa/Menelaus instead, with consequences both predictable and otherwise.

Singing and playing are all outstanding. The period instrument ensemble Cappella Mediterranea, directed by Leonardo Garca Alarcn, give beautiful and stylish support, and the two lead singers - Hungarian soprano Emke Barth as Elena and Rumanian countertenor Valer Barna-Sabadus as Menelao/Elisa - are both fabulous. Also outstanding among the cast are tenor Fernando Guimares as Teseo, mezzo Solenn' Lavanant Linke as Ippolita, soprano Mariana Flores as Erginda, Juno and Castore, bass Scott Conner as Neptune and Tindaro, and mezzo Anna Reinhold as Menesteo. Elena and Menelao/Elisa make a particularly engaging couple, and their duets produce some of the finest and most touching moments in the opera. Their first meeting in Act I, with Menelao still very much in disguise, is electric, and then in Act III, once Menelao has revealed (literally) his true identity, their  duets both before and after  the inevitable offstage consequences bring more beautiful love music - one of these moments being shown in the cover photo.

And there are many other fine musical episodes: the delightful squabbling of gods and goddesses in the Prologue; Elena's first aria, 'Pleasures of love', graceful, playful and touching, soon followed by glorious soprano duetting between Barth and her attendant Mariana Flores. The attempted, misguided seduction of 'Elisa' by Pirithous is highly entertaining, and, at the end of Act II, the display of bravado by the Argonauts, brandishing their weapons, is superb. In Act III, the jilted Hippolyta's lament of seemingly lost love is just as fine; and, at the very end, the double duet of love and reconciliation by the two leading couples makes a beautiful finale.

The stage set is simple but practical; but visually, apart from the delights of the music itself, the other great pleasure for me in this DVD production is to be found in the lovingly-filmed close-ups of the singers in action. This especially benefits lead soprano, Emke Barth, whose looks qualify her without question for the role of the face that launched a thousand ships. But, in fact, all the singers benefit from the close-up treatment, for not only are they an engaging bunch but they all turn in fine character acting to match their excellent voices. This is one element of the DVD format which, one might argue, brings delights even greater than those of seeing the real thing.

Booklet notes are excellent, including clear and detailed plot synopsis and very informative interviews with director Alarcn and producer Jean-Yves Ruf. There is no libretto, but we are offered subtitles in English, French and Italian. Since there's no CD recording available of this, one of Cavalli's finest operas, I bought this DVD set mainly so that I could get to know the music better; but now, once it's up on the screen, I can't take my eyes off it either. Above all, Cavalli's music here epitomises the baroque ideal of so expressing the human passions as to move and to captivate the listener; this production, both musically and visually, brilliantly achieves that aim.",1419897600,15,4731,5.18455497382199
8661144,5,B00KS8SV7I,"Elena is an opera by Francesco Cavalli, the star composer of 17th-century Venice. He wrote 41 operas, and 27 of them survive. Elena was penned in 1659, and was never performed since. The Aix-en-Provence Festival dug it up and give it a full blooded performance at the small Thtre du Jeu de Paume, a relic in the Italian horseshoe style that is perfect for Baroque opera.
Cavalli's score calls for no fewer than 23 different characters, which might explain why it has languished in obscurity for so long. With its European Academy of Music, Aix-en-Provence has a  pool of excellent young singers on which to draw; 13 gifted principals take the 23 main roles.
Elena aka The Abduction of Helen by Cavalli is of course not about the life of Helen of Troy but about racy attitudes towards sex and marriage in 17th century Venice. All of Venice had been excommunicated when Cavalli was four years old, not for its free and easy morality but rather because this rich city had the confidence to ignore playing by rules imposed by others. Elena, the thirty-second of his forty one or so operas, is also about playing harmlessly outside the rules, those of restraint or civilized conduct in particular.
Elena of the title is none other than Helen of Troy but that was in the future. The show in Cavalli's version is very nearly stolen by Menelaus, King of Sparta, who slips into a frock early in the first act as `Elisa' and spends the next three hours stealing his own share of male hearts before disrobing to win Elena's. The opera deals with Helen's marriage to Menelaus. The plot is full of twists as various suitors vie for the hand of the most beautiful woman in the world. There are some wonderful melodies and set pieces and the whole thing eventually ends in happy marriages.
The opera opens with a Prologue which presents a version of the Judgment of Paris and Director Jean-Yves Ruf treats the Prologue as a burlesque.
The convoluted plot centres, more or less, around the wooing of Helen by Menelaus, Theseus and Menestheus. Menelaus cross-dresses as an Amazon called Elisa in order to get closer to Helen. A bunch of men fall in love with Elisa. Theseus's real Amazon wife Hippolyta appears and she wants to kill her husband. The libretto was started by Giovanni Faustini and finished by Nicolo Minato. The plot is convoluted and long, but grab what you can of the central plotline and listen to the music and the singing and you will discover that Cavalli is unfailingly melodic, inventive and simply beautiful in his musical settings.
The 13 young singers are all outstanding. In the two biggest roles, Hungarian Emke Barth who sings the roles of Helen and Venus is a pretty blonde with a beautiful voice. Cavalli gives her some lovely melodies and her ringing and luminous voice delivers them to perfection.
Rumanian countertenor Valer Barna-Sabadus is tall and rangy and is artlessly wonderful as the cross-dressing Menelaus, with all the bloom and agility of a top-drawer countertenor. His singing is simply gorgeous. Both he and Barath are at home on the knife edge between sentiment and comedy, in turn meltingly beautiful and cuttingly funny.
Swiss-Chilean tenor Emiliano Gonzalez Toro also shows impressive range as the buffoon Iro, while Christopher Lowrey is impressive in the smaller countertenor roles. Portuguese tenor Fernando Guimares as Theseus with his deeper voice provided a nice contrast to the countertenor pursuers of Helen. Theseus is betrothed to the Amazon Hippolyta. The latter is sung by mezzo-soprano Solenn'Lavanant Linke, a woman of some stature well suited to the role.
Argentinian conductor Leonardo Garca Alarcn and his Cappella Mediterranea offer us every opportunity to love Cavalli's fluid, inventive, witty, moving, clever music, with an organic musicality that gives every word expression, keeps every dance beat airborne and makes every lament affecting.
Director Jean-Yves Ruf had some tough choices to make with a problematic opera. The opera has a problematic plot, but the performance is well worth its revival.",1418688000,13,4058,4.9676470588235295
8661145,5,B00KS8SV7I,"The 2013 Aix-en-Provence production, conducted by Leonardo Garca Alarcn and directed by Jean-Yves Ruf, seems to be a little uncertain quite what tone to adopt with Cavalli's Elena, a work that hasn't been produced in full for over 350 years. Is Elena meant to be played as a relatively straight account of the abduction of Helen of Troy or is it more of what the Aix programme describes as a ""vaudeville mythologique"" or indeed in reference to Offenbach, a ""Baroque Belle Hlne""? When in doubt, it seems that the best model for playing Cavalli is to look back at his master and mentor, Claudio Monteverdi and in particular at his masterpiece L'Incoronazione di Poppea. Following its innovative approach to mixing of the vulgar and the sublime, the human and the heavenly, Elena seems to assert its own tone quite successfully.

The opera starts out light and humorous, with folk-like dance rhythms marked out on harpsichord, but it's given tremendous colour through Cavalli's writing for woodwind and trumpet, with the lute-like theorbo used as well for more plaintive laments. The dominant tone however is established when the central relationship of Elena and Menelaus emerges from the complications that ensue when the colourful cast comes into contact with the face that launched a thousand ships, and probably just as many operas. It's a complicated affair involving disguises and cross-dressing arising, and if there's an element of farce to it, the sentiments expressed are nonetheless heartfelt. Helen's maid, Astianassa for example, only wishes that someone cared enough to abduct her and sings a beautiful aria of sadness for her position. The same is the case for the spurned Hippolyta, for the Prince Menestheus who falls in love with Helen on first sight, and for King Tyndareus. Their passions might seem silly to others, but they are real to them.

If Monteverdi's L'Incoronazione di Poppea is the model to follow in terms of setting the variations of tone to be found in Elena, Cavalli's writing goes beyond his mentor's in the richness of its harmonies and instrumentation, in the supplementation of the basso continuo, but particularly in the writing for voices. In addition to the expected solo laments, much of the plot and interaction between the characters is developed though beautiful duets, and it's used as well to express their compatibility and common accord. Often both voices sing the same words, one a beat behind the other, but the harmony of the voices and the expressions of lyrical beauty are quite extraordinary.  The duets between Menelaus and Helen affirm the rightness of their union and the opera likewise ends with a short but beautiful quartet of voices that tells us all is well - for now at least. The singing is excellent particularly from these main players - Emke Barth as Helen, Fernando Guimares as Theseus, and Solenn' Lavanant Linke as Hippolyta, but the stand-out performance is undoubtedly that of countertenor Valer Barna-Sabadus as Menelaus.

The stage direction by Jean-Yves Ruf and the set designs by Laure Pichat keep things relatively simple. The stage is small and resembles an arena or a bullring, with a semi-circle of wood fencing behind the players. The period is not classical but closer to 17th century, the production even employing old-style special effects for wind and storms, with billowing sails for those sea journeys. It doesn't always sustain visual interest in what is a long 3-hour opera with a great deal of characters and repetitive situations, but the simplicity and intimacy of the setting is undoubtedly the best way to play a work of this type, and it frames the strengths of Cavalli's writing and supports the fine singing.",1407801600,25,3706,5.060556464811784
