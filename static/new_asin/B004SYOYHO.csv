4464905,5,B004SYOYHO,"In 2010 3d tv's were new. They needed extra giveaways to interest buyers.  the tv's of that generation were far behind the ones of two years later even.  I have  a 2012 tv which should be good enough for at least 8+ years , even if they improve the tv's each year 0r go to a higher resolution there is not a medium that is that higher resolution anyways.  By this time there is increasingly more 3-d product out there.  Even some older movies are starting to appear on 3-d blu ray.  like 'jaws 3-d"" from the early 80's and 'comin at ya' from 1981. it's a good start! but in 2010 there was about ten titles only.  samsung sold their tv/ blu ray player package with this 3d blu ray.  it was never on sale seperately. And that promo ended in may 2011. So this item is now one year out of print , (in 2012) Only samsung buyers got this disc and by now there are lots of imax 3-d titles out there. there wasn't but a few in 2010. and these titles will probably be released seperately on 3-d tv in the future or maybe not? . But at this time if you want this promo disc you will have to buy it used or unopened used. As it was never a seperate item sold in stores. I got mine from a friend who was tired on this item and still has his samsung 2010 3-d tv.  Now you know what this is , it is three 40 minute imax shows, all imax shows are forty minutes; so this is better than most of their seperate blu rays in that regard. One show is from 1995, the other two from the 00's.  You won't find this in a store; so if you want these three films then get this.  the picture is good on all three items and they are typical Imax nature type shows. As with all promo items they sometimes come into print again and sometimes they never do. It's a risk the collector has to gauge when paying for a promo item.  another promo item that is out there that WILL be in print again is 'avatar 3-d' it was only available last year with panasonic plasmas and players. But this is no 'avatar'.",1337990400,7,1969,4.02051282051282
4464906,5,B004SYOYHO,Great people to deal with for a item as I had purchased. Arrived undamaged and very fast. The 3D is fantastic. Hope to do more business with them in the near future.,1336348800,,165,4.1875
4464907,5,B004SYOYHO,"3 in 1 as it really meant to be.

I have seen Pharaos before and can guarantee: the size of duration is the same from the cinema. So the questions about the film's length in this Blu-ray  (supposed to be shorter then original) are incorrect.

The 3 histories are complete.",1318377600,8,272,4.4
4464908,5,B004SYOYHO,"I've only watched two of the features so far (Galapagos and Underwater) but already the disc is a huge success.

As others may have mentioned, this is three half hour documentaries, not three full movies.  Considering I've paid even more for a single disc of similar length (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IMAX-Space-Station-Single-Disc-Blu-ray-3D-Blu-ray-Combo/dp/B0044M2OU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IMAX: Space Station (Single Disc Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray Combo)</a>) I'd call this a much better deal.

The video is much better as well.  The images are crisp, well lit and give an amazing feel of depth.  The underwater video in particular is crisp and realistic.  Rather than the flat 'cut-out' feeling that some 3D videos have, all of the objects here have complex surfaces and depth within the object.

If you want to show off how realistic 3D video can be, this disc is an excellent choice.",1315094400,21,934,5.72463768115942
4464909,3,B004SYOYHO,"This sounds like a three disc set. IT'S NOT!!!!!! This is three movies,each less than 40mins. long on ONE DISC.That should be mentioned in the product discription. If this were three disc's I could accept the price. But to pay over $40 for a single 3-D disc is CRAZY.No single 3-D disk (running time ,less than a feature) is worth $40. Buyer beware. I won't send my copy back as I need to look a little closer at product discription. This purchase taught me that lesson. I hope my review will make you more educated on this purchase. This came to me without a reciept from XCESSBUY through
Amazon. I even had to pay shipping (yuk).",1307145600,52,631,4.448275862068965

8440336,5,B004SYOYHO,One of the best 3D discs. One that should be in your collection if you are a fan of 3D,1446768000,2,86,3.35
8440337,5,B004SYOYHO,"I got this last week on a whim as there was a ridiculous price drop. I will not disclose how much I paid but I am certain that the vendor was not very happy. As for the actual disk, as other reviewers have stated, this is a demo disk that was part of a free giveaway for Samsung 3d Blue Ray players purchases. I'm not sure how a vendor can officially sell a demo disk, but either way I am very pleased that I own these titles without having to purchase a Samsung player, as I own a PS3.

The 3D quality is superb in all 3 movies as they were filmed using a 3D camera. I will comment on the movies as I only previewed about 10 minutes of each, but stunning 3D images sums it up. Other reviews have stated that they would have prefered 3 separate disks which might confuse other into thinking that the movies might be compressed to fit into a single disk. This is totally not the case as they are in full 1080P with no compression. Imax documentaries are typical  only 40 minutes, therefore 3 titles can easily fit on a single Blue Ray disk. There is also the shelf saving benefit of having 1 case instead of 3 and no disk swapping needed on the player. These are great titles with very relaxing audio soundtrack that will enhance any 3d collection. I will remind readers that this disk was inserted into the Samsung bd players so the quality is high enough to showcase your home entertainment system. I absolutely recommend getting this title.",1374451200,7,1442,4.317343173431734
8440338,3,B004SYOYHO,"More like a preview, but did not give me the in depth stuff I was looking for.  Wanted more info about specific places and life on the islands so later purchased the BBC ""Galapagos.""",1373414400,2,182,4.352941176470588
8440339,5,B004SYOYHO,Apparantly this was put together when 3D at home was new - but know this: INTO THE DEEP was my very first Imax 3D experience and it is preserved here in all it's glory and wonder.  Truly a thing of beauty.  Galapologos is considered a classic in the Imax 3D genre and I have not yet seen the MUMMY feature - but this disc features amazing sights and sounds and for one price to have all three is truly amazing.  I now own about 25 3D films and this is in the handful of films - particularly INTO THE DEEP that I put on to show people my system.  Highest reccomendation - or you can buy one or two of them for 25 dollars each - and I don't even know if INTO THE DEEP - maybe the best of it's genre - is even available on a single disk.  Highest props to this set.,1372809600,3,762,3.890322580645161
