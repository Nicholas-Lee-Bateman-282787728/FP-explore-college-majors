6433757,5,B00KMJBHOC,"I know some people are not ""Fonda"" Hanoi Jane, and I am also aware that the community this movie was filmed in was not real receptive to her presence, but that has been twenty-five years ago. The storyline is quite poignant with a widow surviving life working in a bakery, raising two children, and harboring her sister and her abusive brother-n-law at her home. She meets the Robert DeNiro character and they strike up an unlikely friendship. I am particularly fond of Robert DeNiro, so I found this film quite appealing.",1426032000,2,522,4.747252747252747
6433758,5,B00KMJBHOC,"I purchased this for the Stanley and Iris film as I am a huge De Niro fan and it is hard to find this film as a stand alone DVD at a reasonable price. Iris (Fonda) struggles from paycheck to paycheck at her factory job since her husband died. She lives with her sister, who has no job and her abusive husband. There is a lot of crime in the area and she discovers she is pregnant. In short, her life is not fun. The only seeming highlight is her friendship with Stanley (De Niro). She realizes that he is illiterate and mentioning it to his boss gets poor Stanley fired. Because she feels responsible, she decides to offer him reading lessons and they grow closer to one another. I liked Iris' persistence and not giving up on Stanley. They go through several changes and the movie ends with a very happy ending. Both Fonda and De Niro gave good performances.",1421798400,,859,4.341614906832298
6433759,5,B00KMJBHOC,"Love Jane Fonda and This was a touching and Wonderful Film in which i wish
everyone could see...lots to learn from it!",1414454400,,118,4.409090909090909
6433760,5,B00KMJBHOC,"I honestly didn't care for The Hotel New Hampshire, so I'm leaving that alone.

Stanley and Iris was a great 90's movie. You feel Jane Fondas struggle to raise her kids after her husbands death. You also feel for Robert De Niros character. He cannot read, and unfortunately that takes a lot away from him in life. It's amazing to watch them progress and adjust to life together.",1414022400,3,378,4.5588235294117645
6433761,5,B00KMJBHOC,"5 Stars are for Stanley & Iris only.....don't like Hotel New Hampshire.  I really enjoy Stanley & Iris...it's so warm, funny and real.  Makes me smile throughout the movie.  very touching.",1411516800,,188,5.0

6433763,5,B00KMJBHOC,Stanley and Iris is a great movie.  It is a heartwarming story.  The Hotel New Hampshire is pitiful.  They should never have been paired together.,1409529600,3,146,4.76

6433766,5,B00KMJBHOC,I love enjoyed this movie.  Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda are great on the screen together.  I just felt it was a movie who deals with family and a second chance at love.,1388275200,,170,3.9705882352941178
6433767,4,B00KMJBHOC,"I bought this 2 movie set to get Stanley & Iris at a good price.  By itself it will cost you a lot more.  Hotel NH is strange and just not my cup of tea, but I love Stanley & Iris.  Great movie and well worth what I paid.",1379116800,2,221,3.4693877551020407
8660061,2,B00KMJBHOC,"An important note on the format.  As the vast majority of customers would be on 16x9 format TVs by this time, it's important to note that the movies on this disc are NOT anamorphic.  What that means is instead of having a 1.85:1 (16x9) or 2.35:1 image that fills your screen from left to right, the image is 4:3 which means widescreen TVs that most everybody has now will have black bars on the left and right, PLUS the letterbox image with the black bars on top and bottom.  In effect, it will be like watching a miniature movie on your screen.  If your display is set to stretch 4:3 images, you'll get the squashed people effect.  If your display or player has a zoom feature, you can compensate for this somewhat, but that does result in a loss of picture quality.",1527552000,,767,4.373239436619718
