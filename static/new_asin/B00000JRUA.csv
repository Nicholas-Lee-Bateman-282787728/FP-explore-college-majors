1238272,5,B00000JRUA,"This is a must have dvd on the fundamentals of Small Circle Jujitsu.

The legardary Founder and Grandmaster Wally Jay is simply the best!

His principles and concepts are simple and the applications are
devastating.",1278115200,,215,5.114285714285714
1238273,5,B00000JRUA,"I think this is one of the best dvd i have seen on martial art. Out of the 10 principles of small jujitsu, the best that i found was distraction. This distraction gives a weaker person an opportunity to momentorily weaken opponent's grip and later to get into a joint lock.

overall i would say that this dvd is a must for any martial artist, especially beginners or students of middle rank.",1255910400,2,391,4.430555555555555
1238274,5,B00000JRUA,"I'm just starting Jujitsu (at the time of this, I'm still a white belt working towards the first color). This video gives great principles from Wally Jay who is one of the (wikipedia it) founders of small circle jujitsu. He teaches a lot of the theory and technique behind it, as well as shows examples. The dvd quality is actually low production but there are not many good instructional videos out there and this was filmed a long time ago. I would say right now this is the best instructional video I've seen so far. It's good to learn the reason behind the moves because I think it helps you (the beginner student) learn how to do the techniques properly and build a good foundation.",1247961600,5,687,4.504
1238275,5,B00000JRUA,I totally enjoyed both dvd's . As a seasoned martial artist I found them to be excellent resource of original material. I happened to experience personally the Small Circle Jujitsu at a recent seminar by the Founder and son Prof. Wally Jay and Master Leon Jay. The whole series is a must in my most humble opinion.,1179792000,6,314,4.526315789473684
1238276,5,B00000JRUA,"Small Circle Jujitsu Volume 1 by Wally Jay

This is volume 1 of a 5 volume series of Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujitsu available on VHS or DVD.  There is also a book by the same title written by Wally jay with easy to follow illustrations and text sold separately which can be used with these videos.

Wally Jay explains and demonstrates application of force used in his small circle jujitsu, which uses the physical forces of leverage in a two way torquing rotation applied against the joints of an opponent or assailant to achieve compliance through the application and control of pain.

Wally Jay lists ten principles to practice in performing Jujitsu to achieve winning results.

Wally Jay explains safety principles to the viewer to observe to protect the practice partner from injury while learning or practicing Jujitsu.

Wally Jay demonstrates sensitive pressure points of the body martial artists take advantage of in addition to the application of pressure of leverage upon joints.

Wally Jay demonstrates an arsenal of holds, wrist locks, elbow locks, arm bars, finger locks and holds.  Demonstrations of moves and techniques are detailed for maximum effect.  The 5 volume series of Small Circle Jujitsu is well organized and full of information.  The applications of Jujitsu moves covered are credible more oriented for self defense than for competition.  Anyone practicing these moves while keeping Wally Jay's 10 principles in mind should feel confident and prepared to deal with the scenarios examplified in the video.  Anyone who does practice the moves and techniques demonstrated by Wally Jay with a partner should practice slowly and with care not to injure the partner since the information contained in this video has real potential for serious injury if practiced carelessly.

I think what is missing in this series is coverage on dealing with armed assailants and multiple assailants.  If these things were added, the topics of self defense would seem more complete in terms of grappling solutions to assalt scenarios.

The book and the VHS or DVD series complement each other very well as excellent sources of learning.  I think any serious student will be satisfied with his or her purchase.",1098230400,5,2215,5.094182825484765

7913379,5,B00000JRUA,"Tony Anthony was born half Italian and half Chinese. He suffered excruciating torment at the hands of his grandfather, who trained him to handle super heavy doses of pain to become a Kung Fu champion. He won the world Kung Fu championship three times, no easy task. He then became a bodyguard, and had many hair raising adventures before becoming a Christian Evangelist. A remarkable true story of a boy then man who suffered so much rejection, from westerners because he spoke with a Chinese accent, and by Chinese because he was a "" round eye "". This book is not for the faint hearted, nevertheless it is a true story that needs to be told. Dont believe any reports that some of this stuff is made up. I know Tony is no liar.

7913381,5,B00000JRUA,"Professor Wally Jay is not only a brilliant teacher but a multi-talented martial artist, particularly in his Small Circle teachings. A wonderful man too, met him at a seminar in 1985, seems ageless even now. Very effective techniques with little strength required,
can be incredibly painful if you are on the receiving end.",1396137600,,323,5.113207547169812
7913382,4,B00000JRUA,"An excellent resource for an excellent master. Wally Jay has been considered to be one of, if not the greatest ju-jitsu practitioners in the history of the art. You'll likely learn a lot watching it unless you're an advanced practitioner, and even then you'll still pick several things. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that the production value on this DVD is sub par. Other than that, this is a great resource and it really builds on the foundations that he lays out in his book.",1385856000,3,506,4.510869565217392
7913383,5,B00000JRUA,"This is a great lesson in the basics of small circle jujitsu. I recommend this to anyone who has a teacher to help him/her  begin exploring these concepts and principals. It doesn't make sense to buy it separated from the rest of the series. I was pleasantly surprised by the length of the disc. If you are a martial artist and have some basic concepts of traditional Japanese Judo or Jujitsu, you will find that this series will help you develop certain attributes that are helpful in unregulated street fights. This series could also be helpful to law enforcement and security professionals. Best if you have a teacher though as all joint locks can cause serious dislocations and even tears of ligaments and tendons if performed incorrectly. You don't actually want to break anything if you are simply trying to control someone, and you usually don't want to put your training partner in the hospital. Safety first people. Peace.",1356220800,2,931,4.855345911949685
