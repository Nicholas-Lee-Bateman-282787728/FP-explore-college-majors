1074365,2,6305808155,"Oh dear. This isn't really an Ilsa film, but was changed at the last minute, as Dyanne Thorn was playing such a similar character it seemed daft not to cash in. As a result, all references to the character's name on the  soundtrack and the titles have been sloppily altered. It really wasn't  worth  the trouble, as this is a very feeble continuation of the series, by  famous hack Jesus Franco, who has trebled the amounts of naked female flesh  on show, but drastically reduced all the other elements that made the films  interesting. For the record, this film sets Ilsa in some kind of  prison/reform school for wicked women, where she presides over staff and  inmates alike with absolute power. There are long scenes set in showers,  bedrooms, toilets, you get the picture, but very little cruelty, which is  after all what we expect. Dyanne Thorn looks great as ever, even as a  redhead instead of icy blonde, but the camera work is so shoddy, and the  make-up effects are so diabolical (check out the climactic ""death by  hands and teeth"" scene - pathetic!) that its really not worth  bothering.",957312000,,1101,4.696335078534031

1074620,2,6305808155,"In case you didn't know it, there are several kinds of exploitation films, many of which have evolved because of a particular audiences (ahem!) particular sensibilities.  For example, theres girls-behind-bars flicks.  Theres all kinds of assault features.  And never forget the basic girl-on-girl action.  But the least interesting that Ive ever happened across are the ones that essentially traffic in straight or mild-sexually-related torture.  Generally speaking, Ive found these films have little appeal (certain to me, that is), and the stories they try to tell rarely build up a serious head of steam, mostly because all that writer, director, and cast seek to do is to find yet one more bizarre way to not only inflict pain but also capture it on celluloid.

One of the most notable series of this type centered on a lead character named Ilsa, a buxom punisher who found her way (surprisingly) into several different career types, be it soldier, doctor, or prison warden.  This is Ilsa, and these are her stories.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

Ilsa  now known as Greta (played with more aplomb than God shouldve given any woman by Dyanne Thorne)  runs a mental hospital in some cut-rate, third world country.  However, what goes on behind-the-scenes is far more nefarious than what she would have you believe.  She tortures these women, often times within the cold reach of death, and this has drawn the ire of political groups around the nation.  One woman  Abbie Phillips (Tania Busselier)  discovers that her sister has been incarcerated there, and she hatches a risky scheme: shell have herself committed so that she can find her tortured sibling and bring her back alive!

To be perfectly honest, theres an awful lot about WARDEN that, no matter how you slice end, ends up being relatively tame.  Much of the exploitation here is torture  though with helping handfuls of nudity  but very, very, very little of it relates to sex.  Granted, writer/director Jesus Franco tries to redeem himself in the last reel by unloading a gang rape of vicious male convicts on some unsuspecting female inmates; as is often the case with films of this nature, its all handled for maximum titillation, but it ends up being too little too late in the sex department (so far as this critic is concerned).

To the productions credit (but possibly to the disdain of viewers expecting something a bit different), WARDEN has more story than traditional flicks of this variety: several of these inmates actually have a backstory that cleverly works into their predicament and exactly why they're in a rehabilitation facility, and Franco and his writing partner (Erwin C. Dietrich) even gave Phillips a reason to put himself into this mess.  But once the story turns its sights toward establishing most of these female victims as political prisoners, methinks Franco bit off more than he could chew.  (The auteur himself even shows up as the clinic physician and head of the unnamed resistance movement!)

Also, Id be remiss if I didn't point out that several sequences are actually highlighted by some clever imagery.  For example, the opening sequence is actually edited quite nicely: the warden is shown enjoying a luxurious bubble bath, and her shots are juxtaposed with the harsh, cruel, cold environment of the prison-like showers were the ladies are trying to get clean.  Franco doesnt stop there: later in the film, he cleverly pans back and forth between scenes of torture and framed prints of artistic paintings hanging nearby on the wall  its almost as if you can guess the man was winking at his audience, saying One mans Picasso is another mans anal/soap scene.  Granted, some might dismiss it as simplistic, but it works here probably as well as it was intended.

Lastly, WARDEN is staged almost classically around the theme of revenge.  Greta uses and abuses these women, some of them to the point of serious disfiguration, and Franco pairs up those images (Thornes sculptured beauty against a patient with heavy facial scars) whenever his camera placement allows.  Its all building up to the climax (get it?): the showdown between the evil warden and the girls shes damaged  because nothing (and I do mean nothing) happens in this world without their being a price.

ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN (aka Wanda, The Wicked Warden) (1977) is produced by Erwin C. Dietrich.  DVD distribution for this release is being handled by Cheezy Flicks.  As for the technical specifications, the films sight and sounds actually have held up surprisingly well, though Im led to believe that there mayve been some rough parts excised (edited) from this disc (a few sequences jump uncharacteristically forward in time).  As is often the case with these small releases, there are no special features to speak of relating to the motion picture, but Cheezy Flicks has kindly tacked on a few trailers for like-minded enthusiasts to watch.

MILDLY RECOMMENDED only as (A) a curiosity (B) specifically for folks who have a die-hard interest in relatively hard-core exploitation films because  lets face facts  no one else is really going to uncover all that much redeeming about ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN.  To make matters worse, this is bargain basement exploitation filmmaking where only the cheapest sets available were good enough for the boobs, blood, and (electrified) brains.  Yes, yes, yes, Id certainly agree with anyone who claimed that Dyanne Thorne laid claim to the title of Eighth Wonder of the World, but outside of those dirigibles there really is nothing to see here.  Move along.

In the interests of fairness, Im pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Cheezy Flicks provided me with a DVD copy of ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1389657600,4,6117,4.988165680473373
1074621,2,6305808155,"This movie is about women prisoners.  They are often teased for pleasure and electrified for experiment.  Some broke down mentally.
Some couldn't go through and died.  At times, they are raped for making money.  This bad deed is carried out under the wicked  warden's command.  She has backup from higher officials and politicians because she sells her body too.  In the movie, I can see
three uniform guards, two female and one male.  All are bad guys.  Nudity is at a minimum and not erotic at all.  The ending showed
all prisoners walking into the warden's office.  They, in hatred, ate her alive.  Another angle showed the male guard hiding and taking pictures with a camera thus completing this horror story.
The first few minutes of this movie show a tropical garden setting.  A great scenery is hereby worth to mention. To me, this part is more erotic to senses.",1389398400,3,869,4.713333333333333

I read a number of reviews prior to viewing this as to being rather disturbing (i.e., violence, rape, cannibalism).  The film I saw from Cheezy Flicks must have been edited.  The most disturbing scene in this movie is when Ilsa gets the girls together w/a bunch of horny convicts for a little non-consensual party, however, it was not really all that disturbing, the camera never stayed in one spot and you do not see much of anything.  Definitely not like ""I Spit On Your Grave, ""Last House On the Left"" or the original ""Straw Dogs"".  The violence was more suggestive than graphic.  The cannibalism was lame (consisting of stock footage(probably stolen from ""Wild Kingdom"")of lions and/or tigers eating their animal prey).  On the plus side, there is a lot of nudity.  And Ilsa, being the deviant she is, is quite hot.",1338940800,,901,4.774193548387097
1074721,4,6305808155,"A Jess Franco collaboration with German producer Erwin Dietrich released in 1977. Ilsa this time runs a Clinic (somewhere in Spanish speaking northern SA) to ""recover"" sexually sick women. This is a cover though for Ilsa to go wild and satisfy herself sexually and sadistically on the inmates. In addition, Ilsa and his guardian dog manage to film most of their atrocities and get some extra cash to keep running their business. In the middle, and helped by Dr. Milton Arcos (Jess Franco), a school teacher goes undercover to find out about her sister, a former inmate who disappeared for a year so far. Having in mind that this is a B-movie, this one is actually a quite descent one, with a plot connecting most of the scenes in the movie. An above average Franco film in particular. As you might guess, you have lots of women nudity, rape, and torture sequences. Yet, you have less sex scenes compared with the previous, Don Edmonds' Ilsa (Ilsa: the she-wolf of the SS, 1975).

Technically, this Anchor Bay release seems the most complete available as advertised on the cover. The movie runs for 94 minutes, with an English audio, and no subtitles. Note that IMDB indicates a 95 minute version released in Argentina, so who knows whether there is a version longer by 1 minute somewhere. Nice widescreen presentation with a very good digital, clear transfer. Very few extras, so that's not a plus on this DVD.",1331337600,,1410,4.755102040816326

1074827,5,6305808155,"The first film in the Ilsa series, ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS,"" stands as one of the most horrific exploitation films ever made. Even I blanched over the atrocities depicted in the movie. Moreover, it's a rare bird as far as films go because it never loses its power to shock. In fact, I think the first Ilsa movie becomes even more disgusting with each subsequent viewing. Apparently, audiences flipped their cookies after seeing the movie at the drive-in. Word of mouth led to bigger ticket sales, which in turn led to thoughts about a sequel. If you've seen ""She-Wolf,"" you know the idea of a sequel is laughable since Ilsa took a header at the end of the movie. But the wacky world of cinema knows no bounds when the scent of money is in the air, and even the demise of a primary character won't prevent Hollywood hacks from revisiting old ground. Remember the Bobby Ewing dream sequence imbroglio? If they can get away with something that outrageous, resurrecting the deceased Ilsa presents no problem at all. Thus a sequel to the first ""Ilsa"" film arrived on the scene in 1976. Two other films would follow before the series ground to an ignominious end. Thanks to Anchor Bay and the DVD revolution, Ilsa has returned from the grave to haunt us once again.

Set in the waning days of the Second World War, ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" unfolds in a medical camp where the brutal commander Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) and her busty minions wreak havoc on a bevy of female prisoners. There are a few guys around too, mostly to act as boy toys for Ilsa's ravenous appetites. Ilsa's supposed to be conducting experiments on helpless prisoners that will benefit the German military effort, but she's got disturbing side project going on as well. According to the She-Wolf, women possess certain biological characteristics that make them more resistant to pain then men. You can almost guess what happens next: Ilsa sets aside a hidden little laboratory in the basement of her office to test out her personal theories while the approved experiments take place in another building. Both sets of trials are excruciating to watch. The Germans test the effects of high pressure, boiling temperatures, and diseases on the female inmates of the prison. Down in the basement, Ilsa and her two blonde goons strip down to the waist in order to administer severe beatings to selected troublemakers. There's a lot more I could detail, but believe it or not these are the least offensive scenes in the movie. ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" is sick, sick stuff.

""Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks"" takes place in the Middle East many years after World War II. This time around Dyanne Thorne isn't strutting around in a German uniform. Instead, she wears khaki garb in the service of the wealthy but morally depraved Sheik El Sharif (Victor Alexander). The oil wealth in this little kingdom gives the monarch plenty of time to indulge in decidedly unsavory activities, and it is Ilsa who serves as his main honcho. She procures the girls, develops the torture implements, and helps run a tight ship around the palace with the help of Velvet (Marilyn Joi) and Satin (Tanya Boyd), two scantily clad thugettes with some mean karate skills. The latest scheme cooked up by Ilsa and the sheik involves kidnapping several wealthy white women (one played by Uschi Digard) in order to make money in a slavery racket. They figure they can sell these women to some of the powerful local sheiks and thus keep El Sharif's enemies pacified. But just as Ilsa's powerful appetites for men undid her in the first film, the same thing happens here when a spy named Commander Adam (Mark Thayer) of the U.S. Navy pops in to say hello. What follows is sleazy sickness, exploitation style.

Dyanne Thorne again reprises her role as a sadistic torturer of young women in Jess Franco's ""Ilsa, the Wicked Warden,"" but this time she's hamming it up somewhere in South America as the head kook at a clinic for female degenerates. The plot is the equivalent of crayon scribbling by a three year old: a young woman escapes from this clinic, receives mortal wounds during the escape attempt, and manages to tell her story to a local physician before dying (Or does she?). This man, Dr. Milton Arcos (Jess Franco himself!) tries to goad the authorities into launching an investigation into the clinic. Nothing much happens at a public committee meeting, but a young woman named Abbie Phillips (Tania Busselier) accosts Arcos in the parking lot afterwards. She's the sister of the aforementioned victim, also a journalist, and she wants Arcos to help her infiltrate the clinic in order to bring the evildoers to justice. Like I said, a three year old with a box of crayons likely crafted the script. It's not like the plot is all that important; it serves merely as the most tenuous of threads with which Franco can tie together his usual penchant for nudity, depraved violence, and ham fisted dialogue. One thing is for certain: ""Ilsa, the Wicked Warden"" easily maintains the sleaze factor established in the first two films.

Sick films, all of them, although the law of diminishing returns is apparent in these three pictures. Anchor Bay treats them all with respect, however, by giving us commentary tracks on each disc. It's well worth your time to listen to these insights on the films, as all three are full of humor and intriguing remarks about the agony and ecstasy of low budget filmmaking. My only quibble with the set is the absence of the fourth Ilsa film, called ""Ilsa, Tigress of Siberia."" To my knowledge, this entry in the series has yet to appear on DVD. Anyway, give these a shot if you love sleaze cinema; they're practically required viewing for exploitation lovers.",1124928000,19,5730,4.773185483870968

Dyanne Thorne reprises her role as a sadistic torturer of young women in Franco's effort, but this time she's hamming it up somewhere in South America as the head kook at a clinic for female degenerates. The plot is the equivalent of crayon scribbling from a three year old: a young woman escapes from this clinic, receives mortal wounds during the escape attempt, and manages to tell her story to a local physician before dying (Or does she?).

One thing is for certain: ""Ilsa, the Wicked Warden"" easily maintains the sleaze factor established in the first two films.

The arrival of Abbie Phillips into the sanitarium sets in motion a series of banal events that culminate in the execution of head warden Greta...er, I mean Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne). While trying to discover what happened to her sister, our heroine befriends a female inmate who tells us with great glee how she used to be a man, runs afoul of cellblock bully Juana (Lina Romay), and witnesses the red haired Greta/Ilsa beast rule over the patients with an iron fist. The sleaze washes over us in waves. Numerous shower scenes involving all the girls fail to provide kicks thanks to frequent cutaways to the leering visages of Greta's two ugly female sidekicks. At least someone finds this stuff thrilling. Then there is the subplot involving the male prison guard making cash on the side by selling films of the atrocities in the clinic to a guy on the outside. And who can forget Greta's shenanigans? Who can forget how she uses Juana as a human pincushion? Or the injections and electric shocks she delivers to recalcitrant prisoners? That our gal looks like a million bucks with red hair, a black beret, and a bust that makes grown men weep while committing her outrages is just icing on the cake. By the time the film shows us the consumption scene--intercut with real footage of lions devouring meat--we all must acknowledge we've just scene a ""classic."" Check, please!

""Ilsa, the Wicked Warden"" came out under a number of alternate titles, including ""Greta, the Mad Butcher,"" ""Wanda, the Wicked Warden,"" and ""Greta, the Sadist."" I happen to enjoy a few Jess Franco films, like ""Faceless"" and ""Vampyros Lesbos,"" but this one falls into the schlock category. If you want to know what doesn't work here, take your pick: dialogue, dubbing, editing, pacing, direction, acting, and lighting--it's all abysmal. Even after Anchor Bay gave the film a boost during the transfer to DVD, the movie still looks cheap and cheesy. Franco probably shot it on inferior film stock to save a few bucks. The best thing about the film, and I know I'm stretching to say something positive, is how Dyanne Thorne looks like she's making a different film than the one we're seeing, and indeed this suspicion receives confirmation from the actress on the commentary track. Yet despite the myriad negatives, and I could go on and on listing even more vileness contained in the movie, I'm going to give this film three stars. Why? Because Dyanne Thorne is still a real kick to watch even though she might as well be phoning in her performance from Venus. She's fascinating.

Extras on the disc include a trailer, cast and crew biographies, and a commentary track. Give this last feature a listen. Dyanne Thorne, Howard Maurer, and ""humorist"" Martin Lewis discuss every aspect of the film. All three roundly condemn the picture as pure schlock, and discuss everything from room accommodations while on the shoot to the weird world of Jess Franco filmmaking. Lewis seems fascinated with the number of films made by Franco, and equally fascinated by the bizarre alternate titles most of his films carry. Fans of exploitation will definitely want to give this a watch, although I recommend the first two Ilsa films over this one.",1124841600,5,5682,4.8246153846153845

1074830,4,6305808155,"If you're gonna revel in trash, might as well go all the way-and Anchor Bay's epic (and economical) 3-DVD ""Ilsa"" set is a ""trash"" collection of the highest order. The box kicks off with the one that started it all-""She-Wolf of The SS"", which is every bit as deliciously tasteless as its title suggests. Famously, ""She Wolf""'s exterior scenes were filmed on TV's ""Hogan's Heroes"" set (!) with an amazing 9 day shooting schedule. The ""Hogan"" connection seems oddly prescient, now that the twisted backstage antics of Bob Crane are public knowledge (screen ""Auto Focus"" with ""Ilsa"" for the ultimate in bad taste double-bill). ""She Wolf"" and its two sequels are presented uncut and immaculately remastered (although there are times you'll wish the images weren't so sparkling). Obviously, you need to possess a certain, er, sense of aesthetic to appreciate this type of exploitation film. As the director himself states,these films were made in the days before you had to be ""greenlighted"" by studio suits after spending years in ""development hell"". If you had financial backing, a camera and a willing cast, you simply went out and shot your film, and that was that, no apologies owed to anyone. In the case of the ""Ilsa"" series, the filmmakers were lucky enough to attract a huge enough cult following over the years to keep interest alive. All three films feature commentary tracks. One caveat: the ""comedian"" who appears on the commentary tracks and is billed as the ""moderator"" is a complete moron. Dyanne ""Ilsa"" Thorne and her director/husband are endearingly good-humored about the whole thing and very funny on thier own, I'm not sure whose idea it was to include this ""moderator"" who obviously has NO sense of movie history (9 times out of 10, whenever he attempts to add trivia, he is corrected by the others!). And, thankfully, the director himself (and he should know!) finally puts a ridiculous urban legend to rest: No, that is NOT the late great Spalding Gray working under a non de plume in ""Oil Sheiks"".

1074883,2,6305808155,"Very disappointing.  You'd think that Ilsa in the hands of a foreign director could take the series into new territories.  Nope.  In fact, this is NOT an Ilsa film.  In Europe it has a different title, but when this turd washed up on American shores they decided to slap the Ilsa name on it only coz it has Dyanne Thorne playing a sexy, sadistic warden.  Her name isn't even once said in the film!  The Ilsa films are a fun mix of camp, sex and violence.  Franco's film plays it straight(though it's unintentionally funny) and goes more for the sex, Sex, SEX!  The violence takes a back seat.  This ruined it for me.  There are a record number of naked women and lesbian scenes in this film-and even that gets boring fast.  In all honesty, if this is what I wanted to see, I'd just go the whole nine yards and rent a porno flick.  Why beat around the bush(no pun intended)?  Even Thorne is wasted in this film, not that she's given much to work with.  She doesn't even look as hot as the first two Ilsa films, though she can still be my wicked warden any day.  You also get to see a little more of her anatomy this time-Big whoop!  It's not worth the other 92 minutes and 58 seconds.  However, if sex is your bag, baby, then you might  actually like this ""Ilsa"" film more than the others.  It all comes down to what you're looking for.",1099094400,,1335,4.247011952191235
1074884,4,6305808155,"Let me start by saying that Duke's review is totally accurate, and I really have nothing helpful to add to what he said.  This review is written from the point of view of someone who had never seen one of the Ilsa movies before I bought the set, so people who are new to these sleazefests may be able to relate.
From what I've heard and read, these movies are textbook examples of 70's grindhouse cinema the likes of which would play in the crime-infested movie houses of NYC's 42nd Street.  Watching these films, you can almost feel yourself in the front row of the theatre smelling the marijuana smoke, hoping you don't get mugged, and wondering what exactly those weird sounds are emanating from the rows behind you.  In other words, these movies are gutter sleaze that go directly for the shocks and titillation.
Ilsa is played by Dyanne Thorne.  For anyone unfamiliar with this actress (as I was), let me just say I was mighty impressed with her talents, both talents to be exact.  This was before breast implants were the norm, which adds on extra points for her being a ""natural.""
The first in the series, Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS is the best of the three.  Talk about sick!  Basically I would describe all three films as softcore 70's sex with gore and torture scenes, with She Wolf being the most extreme.  The films do have plots, but the storylines are almost incidental to the shocking scenes featured within.  She Wolf had the most blood and gore, so as a horror fan I appreciated it the most.
Next up is Ilsa: Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks.  It's pretty amusing how the Ilsa character was updated from WW2 times to the oil-starved 1970's without blinking an eye (or aging).  There is really no explanation given for this, which adds to the campy fun.  Sheik El Sharif is played by Victor Alexander, who is actually Spalding ""Swimming to Cambodia"" Gray!  I was surprised to see that this favorite of the 1980's-90's college spoken word circuit used to play in sleazy softcore films.  There's a little more story here than in the first film, weak though it may be.  I thought the Kissinger-parody character ""Kaiser"" was pretty funny myself.  Not as much gore and sadism as the first film, but still worth checking out.
Finally, there's Ilsa: The Wicked Warden directed by the legendary Jess Franco.  From the little I heard of the audio commentary, it seems that Dyanne Thorne and co-star Howard Maurer  were told beforehand that this was definitely NOT an Ilsa movie, but during shooting it became painfully apparent the filmmakers were intending for it to be an (unofficial) part of the series.  Maurer theorizes that this may have been for financial reasons, specifically to avoid paying for the use of the name and the character.  It ran under many titles, including Greta: The Mad Butcher and Wanda: The Wicked Warden.  Conveniently, Thorne's character remains nameless as the head of a ""therapeutic"" prison-clinic for female sex offenders where the inmates all wear shirts but no pants or underwear (!!!!).  Out of the three, this one was the most erotic due to the constant nudity, including two shower scenes and one with a great catfight featuring the luscious Lina Romay.  Again, a throwaway storyline but lots of amusing dubbed acting and terrible dialogue.  The final scene was similar to the ending of Blood Sucking Freaks; in fact if you liked that movie you will probably dig this box set as well.
Unfortunately there's no Ilsa: Tigress of Siberia included here to round out the series.  From what I've heard that film is by far the weakest of the four.  Like the Wicked Warden, Thorne's character was never referred to as Ilsa, so it was another attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the first two films.  Maybe Anchor Bay could release a DVD edition of Tigress with a bonus disc of a Dyanne Thorne biography/scrapbook, for all us collector nerds out there?  Wishful thinking, I know.
To sum it up, if you're considering buying any of the Ilsa films you might as well go for the box set.  All three are worth seeing, and if you compare the price of buying the movies separately versus the set price, it's a no-brainer.",1084924800,37,4152,4.680440771349862
1074885,5,6305808155,"Dyanne Thorne's Ilsa is somewhat of a classic and beloved exploitation character and AnchorBay has put together a solid and extremely good value DVD collection of Ilsa films.
The Nazi exploitation or Naziploitation film genre can be traced back to the early film ""The Night Porter"" and in typical 70's European film fashion was pushed to limits with films like ""Love Camp 7"", ""Gestapo's Last Orgy"", ""Beast in Heat"" and the epic ""Salon Kitty"" and various Ilsa clone films like ""Desert Foxes"" and ""Elsa-Fraulien of the SS"". These charming films surely offended some people and many of them were banned in some countries.
""Ilsa-She Wolf of the SS"" proved that American film makers could come up with an equally political incorrect product. Interestingly ""She Wolf"" was shot on the set used for tv show ""Hogan's Heroes"" after the show was cancelled and instead of Col Klink, we have Ilsa as camp commandant. The story is basic: women prisoners are brought in (and stripped for inspection), Ilsa performs experients on them (while they are mostly naked) with her two assistants (hot women who also get naked) later Ilsa helps herself to the male prisoners who are castrated afterwards. Hilariously campy German accents, corny lines (particularly by the male prisoner hero), slightly gorey scenes and of course gratuidous nudity ensure.
""She Wolf"" became a classic and three sequels followed, despite the fact Ilsa dies. The second disc is ""Ilsa-Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks"". Replace the two arian assistants from ""She Wolf"" with sexy black sisters and the women prisoners with new captives for the Harem and theres not much difference between ""She Wolf"" and ""Harem"". Even Sharon Kelly who played a prisoner in the first film returns as a harem recruit, she's the cute woman with red hair and not just on her head ;)
""Ilsa-the Wicked Warden"" is the odd film out as it is actually Jess Franco's knock off which was originally called ""Greta, the Mad Butcher"" and in this one Dyanne Thorne plays the warden of a south American girl's prison?! Of course Franco's wife Lina Romay is featured and it has all the classic women in prison type happenings, shower scenes, torture ect.
The quality of this set is amazing, it is AnchorBay of course, with the superior Audio/Visual quality we've come to expect from the company and even DVD commentaries featuring Dyanne Thorne herself (she is surprisingly witty and charming). The only fault one could possibly fiind with the set is the fact that it doesn't contain ""Ilsa-Tigeress of Siberia"". Why is that commrade?

First, a warning: if you are easily shocked,  offended, or disturbed, you won't make it through this (or any other Ilsa)  movie. I am not exaggerating or saying this lightly.  It takes a lot to  disturb me, but this movie did the trick. If you love campy women's prison  movies, this is also a must-see, though it is much darker and sicker than  most of them. Yes, this is an exploitation flick and does not try to hide  this fact, but it has a plot, and characters you care about. A woman's  sister is being held in a women's prison, so she goes 'undercover' to try  to rescue her. The b*tch in charge of the prison is the most twisted, sick,  evil, sadistic warden you will ever find in any women's prison movie-- the  one and only Ilsa, (or Wanda, or Greta the Mad Butcher, depending on which  version you see) the Wicked Warden. Her idea of a nice relaxing evening is  using one of the female inmates most sensitive bodyparts for a pincushion,  and I am describing the scene tactfully. Others she lobotomizes when they  get out of line (or just for fun). The heroine's plan to infiltrate the  prison and her sister goes horribly awry when she realizes things in there  are much, much worse than she could have dreamed of and there is no escape.  The movie's ending is a total show-stopper, when Ilsa comes to one of the  most fitting, vividly grisly, ugly endings that you will ever see. Not the  most pleasant movie to watch--the first time I saw it, I felt sick for not  turning it off and continuing to watch the horrible acts being committed.  However, I've seen a lot of really great, bad, and twisted  horror/shock/exploitation films, and this one really stands out, with  realistic characters, the courage to have a very downbeat ending, and no  glamourization of the violence.
