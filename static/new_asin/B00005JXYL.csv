1605709,5,B00005JXYL,This title has been available only in German and Russian language versions until now. This release has gotta be way easier to understand. So she`s not on screen every second. Anybody have CR competition video?,997920000,,209,5.0
1605710,2,B00005JXYL,"For anyone hoping to see Cynthia Rothrock reprise her roles in Tiger Claws One and Two, this movie will be disappointing. Ms. Rothrock makes only a cameo appearance in this film. One gets the definite impression that her appearance was more about box office than about improving the film.  The movie itself is not the worst of its genre.  Although there is some woefully sad acting in the non-fighting segments.  The action is pretty good with Jalal Merhi serving as the protagonist. Cynthia fans would only want this video to complete their collection, not for the pitiful amount of time she appears in this film.",997401600,7,614,4.828571428571428

7942479,2,B00005JXYL,"Eight years after its inception, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiger-Claws/dp/630243081X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiger Claws</a>&nbsp;series saw the release of its latest installment to date. I can't predict whether or not we'll see another sequel to this kung fu trilogy, but if this is indeed the last one, then the series has ended on a very strange and ultimately disappointing note. Much weirder than the typical American martial arts flick but not nearly as fulfilling, ""Tiger Claws 3"" attempts a lot but finds little success, its premise simply too grandiose to be sustained by a B-movie budget.

The story: when a martial arts-practicing sorcerer (Loren Avedon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender-2/dp/B0002ISFZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender 2</a>) resurrects a trio of ancient assassins to help him take control of New York, the returning Tarek Richards (Merhi) - finding himself without a partner - will need to master a different form of tiger claw kung fu to defeat them.

(SPOILER) I'm disappointed that the character played by Cynthia Rothrock dies before the movie is a quarter of the way finished: even though I know the circumstances behind her limited involvement, it would have been great to see her in more than one fight. Additionally, Bolo Yeung's character is mentioned but not seen, and the Hong Kong action star chosen to replace him is Carter Wong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-Traitorous/dp/B00009IAXD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin Traitorous</a>), albeit in a good-guy role as the master who teaches Tarek. I'm not sure what to make of him, but unlike Bolo, he gets a chance to be both intentionally and unintentionally funny - gotta love any dialogue between him and Merhi, with both of them struggling to speak English. Additionally, Loren Avedon's role is fairly out-of-the-ordinary for him. I would have liked to see him play up a staunchly evil part, but he eventually settles back into his regular snarky attitude and kind of ruins the effect. The three mystical assassins are surprisingly bland and would be completely forgettable if they didn't have so much screentime.

You see, half of the time you see them, they're shooting electric projectiles through the air, which can either electrocute a person or blow up a police car. This is mainly what I'm talking about when I spoke of how weird this movie is: even though the ending of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiger-Claws-2/dp/B00005BJWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiger Claws 2</a>&nbsp;sort of tried to ease us into this territory, it's still a complete 180 from the relative realism of the original film, and the cheesy animation used to create the effects just doesn't convey what you'd want to see. There's still a good amount of martial arts action - about eight separate fights - but very few of them are any good. The final fight that Merhi has with the last of the assassins probably qualifies as one of the longest and best ones Jalal's ever had, but that's not saying much. A showdown between Loren Avedon and Carter Wong is probably the best the movie has to offer, but as indicated, it's far from the greatest thing you'll see in film.

The ending is one of the biggest copouts I've recently seen, and very much destroys any gravity the movie had going for it. I'm not sure whether my rating would have been any higher had the ending been different, but it's pretty darn cheap from my perspective. It's a disappointing way to end this trilogy, but at least we still have the other two films to fall back on.",1378771200,,3748,5.5701754385964914
7942480,2,B00005JXYL,"Even Carter Wong couldn't save this movie. They give Cynthia Rorthrock second billing and she dies 10 minutes into the movie. She shows up in flashbacks, but not worth it...",1355788800,,173,4.8

7942482,3,B00005JXYL,"What started out as a decent movie, ended up in dissapointment and just an ok flick.  Cynthia Rothrock is indeed only in the beginning of the movie, and the rest focuses on Jalal Mehri, who sorry to say, can not impress me very much.  Loren Avedon (No Retreat, No Surrender 2 & 3, King of the Kickboxers) plays the bad guy in the movie.  His acting actually seemed to improve over his cheesy acting in his other films, but I spoke up too soon by about mid-way through the film.  The 3 ancient evil masters he calls upon are nothing spectacualr in the film, in fact they never speak.  Their skills are alright and they consume most of the fight scenes in the movie.  The final fights in the film are about average, involving Jalal Merhi versus the masters and the Loren Avedon character against his old master, who has now taught the Jalal Merhi character how to fight.

The ending of Tiger Claws 3 is a twist that is almost ridiculous.  It kinda made me mad cause it allowed the movie to leave out Cynthia Rothrock when it really shouldn't have.  Oh well, this is an average flick, basically good to complete the Tiger Claws trilogy, nothing more.  Oh, and yes, No Bolo Young in this one, doh.",1164844800,,1193,4.406392694063927
7942483,1,B00005JXYL,"Well if you're looking for Cynthia Rothrock action in this movie, there is none. It is not a CR movie, but pure Jalal Merhi!
If you like him sure, go ahead and grab this one.",1084924800,2,174,4.0
