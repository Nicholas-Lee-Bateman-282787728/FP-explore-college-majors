8108931,4,B000EFOV2Y,"This is a classic Hong Kong kung fu movie from the 90s.  If you can enjoy that for what it is, this you'll like this movie.  Yeah, the quality of the movie isn't great, but this movie came from a time when the kung fu came first and in that sense, this movie delivers.",1407110400,,268,3.9444444444444446

8108933,3,B000EFOV2Y,It was okay. All subtitles. Wacky martial arts. Probably one of the least enjoyed of my Jet Li movies. I probably wouldn't recommend it .,1364860800,2,137,4.52
8108934,2,B000EFOV2Y,"This is a spoof on martial arts movies like Three Stooges movies are here only this one isn't funny. Everyone giggles all through this entire film and has Chinese guy complete with buck teeth that stick out an inch or so from his mouth. I paid for it or I'd never have watched 5 minutes of this ridiculous film.
The movie would be great for kids up to let's say 12 years old that see humor in stupid foolish things. How Jet Li got himself into this is amazing to me for I'd fire my agent immediately. People fly around and no one gets hurt, and it's just a very poor film for ANYONE that has EVER seen a good film.",1356307200,,614,4.082644628099174
8108935,5,B000EFOV2Y,definitely worth a watch and chuckle.  don't expect anything hardcore like fearless or hero.  jet li stars as wong fei hung and he takes cares of this little town's troubles.,1353196800,,174,4.766666666666667
