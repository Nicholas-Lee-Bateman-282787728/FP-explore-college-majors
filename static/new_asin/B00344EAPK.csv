4066254,2,B00344EAPK,"Back in the 70's a film called ""Short Eyes"" was released.  It had the same type of plot, and I found that movie to be more convincing than this one.  The actors were drab, the cutaway scenes of them telling their stories of what happened was a bore.  They sure don't make prison movies like they used to.  Short Eyes was much much better.",1293753600,,338,4.234375
4066255,4,B00344EAPK,"I must say that I don't care about Uwe Boll's reputation, even though he has made some bad movies. Now, Stoic is set entirely in a prison cell with sequences of fighting, rape and sodomy, and abuse. If you can't handle those things, turn away from this movie. Each set of abuse is divided by interviews with three of the cell mates that do a great job at acting. Good news, the shaky camera isn't as annoying as it was in Rampage and Darfur.
The ending is what really brings it down a star for me because I just didn't agree with it factually. This was a great movie with minimal plot, which Uwe is actually good at doing because I personally don't think that he writes well. I could watch it again, but I would probably watch it with the commentary or just the special features. Once you watch it once, you don't feel the urge to really watch it again. Rent it and see for yourself.",1291680000,2,883,4.261904761904762
4066256,4,B00344EAPK,"I love a good horror film, and I don't often see good ones these days. So many horror films have jumped on the ""torture porn"" bandwagon, and have replaced suspense, tension, and an exploration of the darkest parts of human nature with outrageous gory stunts being performed on half-baked characters (Yes, makers of the ""Saw"" franchise, I'm talking to you!)

""Stoic"" is a horror film in the truest sense of the word, because it is a truly horrifying depiction of the darkest, sickest, most cruel and cowardly aspects of human nature. Four petty criminals (not murderers or rapists, but in jail for minor drug offenses, robbery, etc) sit alone in a cell, going about their normal routine of shooting the breeze and playing cards. When one of the foursome places a bet that involves the cost of an unpleasant act (the eating of some toothpaste) and then refuses to follow through, it sets in motion a series of acts which begin as unpleasant, and quickly escalate into abuse, beatings, torture, rape, and murder.

The film does a good job of making the series of events seem believable. The young men are all caged, angry, scared, and, most of all, determined to maintain their reputations as tough and a part of the group. Whenever any of the characters display a slight sense of apprehension or conscience, the other characters are quick to instill in them the fear of the consequences of going against the pack. The film cuts from the showing of the events that led up to the death of the victim with interviews with the three perpetrators following the crime. Ultimately, each of the characters is processing the events in a different way, which vary from cold detachment, complete denial, and sniveling regret.

Director Uwe Boll is about to release a film about Auschwitz. ""Stoic"" was probably good exercise for that film, since it depicts a microcosm of the kind of group psychosis which led to the events in Nazi Germany.",1284249600,10,1926,4.795180722891566
4066257,5,B00344EAPK,"A film by Uwe Boll in documentary style.  The story centers around four prisoners in a cell and the events that unfold therein.  The film cuts between the events in the cell and the prisoners being interviewed and giving their take on those events.

WARNING!  This film depicts extremely violent events unfolding as well as very strong language and various obscene acts.  It is definitely not for anyone under 18 and may be highly distasteful to some viewers.  Enter at your own risk, so to say.

Plot (SPOILERS):  Four prisoners shoot the breeze and decide to play a card game and gamble.  One prisoner loses a bet  and refuses to pay up, resulting in his being bullied, brutally beaten, forced to perform obscene acts, and brutally raped.  I won't give away the end.

I gave it 5 stars because I felt that the style Boll was going for was done well and came off as realistic as any documentary you would see on TV.  The actors all did an excellent job in making this feel as real life as possible.  They made you feel that you were seeing actual people who were real prisoners.

I'm not sure if this is correct information, but I have read that this film was based on actual events that occurred in a German prison.",1272844800,,1217,4.468181818181818
4066258,3,B00344EAPK,"""Stoic"" is entirely set in a prison cell shared by four prisoners. An argument during a card game soon spiral into bullying, violence and death. ""Stoic ""i s quite different from most of Uwe Boll's other movies. The movie is not light entertainment. It's a 90 minute study in human cruelty and violence. It's brutal and disturbing and certainly not for all tastes but it's fascinating in a way and the actors all do a good job.",1264809600,10,426,4.545454545454546

8388177,1,B00344EAPK,"WORST. MOVIE. EVER!! I LOVE and watch just about any horror flick imaginable. Even the ones with stupid plots, bad special effects and horrible acting. At least those movies TRY to be creative. This was just a re-creation of a horrific event that happened upon one individual, unfortunately, even though it was a truly sad thing I don't believe it was worth being glorified into a movie. There are many other more compelling examples of the human psychological process during confinement that would be worth telling in a story rather than this one. This movie was poorly filmed, depressing, violent and generally not fun to watch. I don't care how ""bad"" a movie is, if it's entertaining it's worth it....this was not worth it.",1439337600,,726,4.862903225806452
8388178,1,B00344EAPK,"My first 1 star....I had ever given, 1 star because it was a movie about real torture, and what is sad it was a true story :(  I give a 5 star to the actors, for doing such a believable job in acting, I felt like if I was locked up in the cell too.  My stomach still  feels as if someone just punched me very hard and I can't breathe.",1427760000,,334,3.676056338028169
8388179,1,B00344EAPK,"Worst friggin movie ever!! But my services were awesome. People weren't lying when they said this movie was disturbing. Some things are better left unsaid, butt his film scarred me",1404345600,,180,5.033333333333333
8388180,5,B00344EAPK,Very hard to watch but is a must see. Very depressing but it IS based on a true story. Edward Furlong does an amazing job in this movie.,1403481600,,136,3.892857142857143
8388181,4,B00344EAPK,"I enjoyed the movie. It was gritty and raw. Though shocking and in-your-face, since it took place in the jail cell, it felt kind of ""boxed in"".  I did enjoy it though.",1397865600,,167,4.21875
8388182,1,B00344EAPK,"Stoic explores the question of weather or not prison turns minor offenders into hardened criminals, by telling a true story that happened in 2006. The story is most defiantly an eye opener, but the truth is that it doesn't make for a very good movie. Four inmates are trapped in the same cell, twenty-three hours a day. Most of them are in prison for minor offenses, with sentences ranging from six months to six years. As the men play cards, three get suspicious of the fourth, and once they decide he's a cheater, they begin to torture and humiliate the man until the next morning, when one of them winds up dead. Edward Furlong is the only actor of recognition in this film, usually one of my favorite actors, but even he has a hard time making this story work. The truth is that no matter the situation, anytime you place four guys in a room and watch them for an hour and a half, it's bound to get boring. Stoic goes to extreme lengths to be beyond boring, because of it's perfectionist director, Uwe Boll. Boll has a reputation of doing things his own way and being a perfectionist about it. The constant changing of the camera angles as well as the inmates telling their own stories in cutaways, is somewhat clever, but ultimately there really isn't much here to base a film on. Stoic was a good idea, that poses an important question, through a shockingly true story, but it lacks the substances needed to entertain an audience. In other words it was one big bore of a movie that you should absolutely avoid.",1386806400,,1516,4.496376811594203
8388183,5,B00344EAPK,This movie was exceptional at captivating what really goes on in the prison system. This movie is not for the faint of heart.,1365033600,,125,4.478260869565218
8388184,5,B00344EAPK,"I've seen a lot of prison movies and this is one of the best. And it does something that the others never do, it shows the convict's personalities seemlessly transitioning from normal to sadistically violent. If you have ever watched one of those prison reality shows you know this is how they really are - being able to seem so calm being interviewed then soon after getting into a brutal scuff with the guards. Somebody else here compared this movie to Short Eyes but the only thing they have in common is that they are both prison flicks. In Short Eyes the antagonist's motives for violence are entirely different. And Edward Furlong gives an incredible performance that has to be seen to be believed. Check this one out!!!",1340064000,2,726,4.6796875
