3521627,1,B001D261W0,"I liked the idea of multiple 15 minute yoga workouts, but these workouts are not for everyone. There is too much time spent jumping up and down and that is way too high impact for me due to foot surgery. I have been to many yoga classes at the gym and I have never jumped up and down and I'm OK with that. The other yoga poses are way too quick for me. I understand they wanted to get as much yoga in 15 minutes, but it didn't seem like a good 15 minute practice. The chatter between Rodney Yee and Mariel Hemingway was extremely distracting for me. I could never do this practice more than once since the talk was so annoying. Some people may not be bothered by that.",1264723200,2,668,4.106870229007634
3521628,5,B001D261W0,"The 15-minute ab session alone is worth the money of this DVD. I am always looking for non-sun salutation completely on the floor routines and this one foots the bill. It's great for those lite days where you need some stretching and strengthing your abs, hips, and lower back. Wonderful!

The other 3 sessions are very similar to each other, traditional sun salutations focusing on either upper body, lower body, and total body. I love the swingin/rocking sessions which will help you wake up your qi (aka chi). These are the energy systems within your body and will really help bring you into balance, love it!

Rodney includes a short savasana after each 15-min session. Only a minute or two long, but quite effective.

I do agree with the other reviewers that you should have some knowledge of yoga already since there is no instruction on form.

Please read my other recommendation on yoga, meditation, and tai chi on Amazon.

3521629,4,B001D261W0,"My first yoga class was over 6 years ago, and I could not imagine trying to follow this dvd before spending a good amount of time with a live yoga instructor.  That said, I really enjoyed doing the four different 15 minute sessions at home, one concentrating on the upper body, one on the lower body, one on abs, and one total body.  I always like to see how instructors transition from one pose to the other -- strangely, they don't say my favorite mantra, ""Oy!"" while going from up dog to down dog.  Hemingway and Yee have a conversational style when leading these sessions which makes for a nice change from the usual class.  And they even sweat!  So, if you are an experienced yoga practitioner and would like a bit of a change, I would borrow this from the library.  I have a Sara Ivanhoe DVD that I think is the bomb -- great for beginners and the practiced yogini alike, and have used a am/pm yoga DVD that I thought was great and be a better starter yoga DVD.  Hemingway's books have also been great reading and I highly recommend them.",1246060800,9,1044,4.350515463917525
3521630,4,B001D261W0,"I really appreciated this different type of yoga instruction. It was almost like Rodney was just hanging out with you, doing some yoga and the main and only topic of discussion was yoga.

For some the banter between Rod and Mariel might get annoying, but not for me. It's like that dog that barks at me every morning on my run. Or that strange canyon I pass by on my run that sounds like a tornado. Or that man I pass by on my run 3 or 4 times out of the week who never says hi and refuses to acknowledge my presence. These things could be annoying but I just consider them a part of the living world. It just is.

The chit chat between the two instructors on this DVD just seems real to me. And in turn they make my time with them seem real. And after Savasana, I feel just as refreshed as with any real yoga class or any other DVD.

The only reason I give this DVD 4 stars (instead of 5) was because the DVD only comes with the 4 workouts. There are no extra goodies in the DVD, and for me that was a little disappointing.",1244851200,8,1024,4.009803921568627
3521631,3,B001D261W0,"I have been doing Rodney Yee's yoga DVDs for years now and he is one of my favourite instructors. I also really enjoy the shorter practices as I seem to always be able to fit 15-25 minutes into my day. So I was initially quite excited about Gaiam's new DVD, but this is not your usual Rodney Yee practice. YOGA 15-MINUTE RESULTS is chatty, informal, and has a very different style than his previous workouts.  I am still kind of on the fence with how I feel about this. On one hand it was nice to see Mr. Lee relaxed, laughing and joking with Mariel but on the other hand some serious, legible voice instruction would have been good too.

This DVD contains 4-15 minute workouts including;
Upper Body Toning
Lower Body Sculpting
Abdominal Strengthening
Total Body Conditioning

Filmed indoors with quiet background music there is no voice over instead Rodney wears a headset and just kind-of chats out the instruction between quips with Mariel. All the sessions are very similar even though they are meant to target four different areas, and the poses, although basic and repetitive move rather quickly from one to the next. There is also some weird jumping and arm swinging included in two sections and a significant amount of ab work throughout. A short relaxation has been included at the end of each workout.

I couldn't recommend this to beginners because of the lack of instruction. I also think that Rodney's chatty banter with Mariel although entertaining the first time will get annoying after listening to it a couple more times. Alternatively I would recommend buying AM YOGA FOR YOUR WEEK (contains 5-20 min workouts) or POWER YOGA STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY (contains 2-25 min workouts) instead. These have a variety of poses, easy to follow instruction, beautiful outdoor scenery and great music.",1240704000,21,1807,4.8762214983713354
3521632,2,B001D261W0,"They could have done so much more with four 15 minute speed yoga sessions.  I have several other Gaiam and Rodney Lee videos and love them all.  But on this one the audio is not narrated over - instead Rodney wears a headset and the few cues he provides are mumbled.  His banter with Marian with loud and clear and will become annoying your second or third time through.  And when I say few cues, I mean it, they move through several poses at a time without providing any verbal prompt - you're in downward dog thinking things are fine and then glance up at the tv to see them in staff pose!  This is important - it is hard to really keep good form if you have to keep peering at the tv.  There are supposed to be four different sessions focusing on different areas - but three of the sessions are nearly identical, they use all the same basic four or five poses.  The only one with even a little variety is the abs.  And there are some strange very un-traditional activities - lots of arm swinging and jumping up and down!  Anyway, I was excited about getting shots of yoga - but am disappointed in the lack of variety, poor audio instruction and very basic poses lacking advancement.  Try Rodney's ""am yoga for your week"" instead - five 20 minute routines, good audio and better variety/more advancement.",1231632000,62,1306,4.404166666666667

3521678,3,B001D261W0,Love all of Rodney's DVDs but this one not so much. They were talking to each other and not to the viewer. So it was hard to know what they were doing next when in a position where I couldn't see TV.,1436745600,,199,3.761904761904762
3521679,4,B001D261W0,"Bought this for my MIL, who is older and needs an easy workout, that's not too long. She can do it and it keeps her moving, is not too hard, and not too long.",1431388800,,158,3.676470588235294

3521681,5,B001D261W0,One of my favorites! I lost my first DVD so I just bought it again. A good way to fit some yoga into a busy day. Some people don't like their little banter but it makes me feel like I'm doing yoga with my friends.,1421798400,,213,3.7555555555555555

3521684,5,B001D261W0,This one is great for beginners. I am older and appreciate the 15 minute programs and how he breaks it down into four sections.,1396396800,,127,4.333333333333333
3521735,3,B001D261W0,This is an okay yoga tape but do  not plan on getting the results in 15 minutes even daily for a month.,1392854400,,103,3.6818181818181817

3521737,5,B001D261W0,"I've used at least 6 different Yoga videos over the last few years and this one has become my favorite.  I like it because the four 15-minute yoga segments are a nice length for me....I usually complete one alone or two segments in the morning, depending on how much time I have.  The four segments are 1)Total Body Conditioning, 2)Upper Body, 3) Lower Body, and 4) Abdominal Strengthening.  All the segments give you a good workout and move quickly, generally starting with a few sun salutations. There's not really a ""warm-up"" for any of the sections, so I always do some basic stretching on my own before I get started.  All 4 segments are done in bare-feet with only a yoga mat, except that the abdominal segment has optional use of a yoga strap in part of it.
Warning: Its not ""meditative"" yoga, so if you're looking for that then look elsewhere. But I'm pretty sure its also not what they call ""Power Yoga"". I'm in pretty good shape (for a middle-aged woman) but not exercise crazy....I mostly do a lot of walking, hiking, and some biking. This DVD works well for me.",1383868800,2,1073,4.544041450777202
3521738,4,B001D261W0,"This is my ""go-to"" DVD when I have only a short time for yoga.  You can also opt to do more than one 15 minute segment;  combining two for 30 min., three for 45 min., or the entire DVD for one hour.  The workouts are good, but you should know basic yoga poses before using this DVD.  I am not as ""annoyed"" by the friendly banter of Rodney and Mariel as other who have reviewed this.  It is definitely one yoga DVD that should be in your workout queue.",1383177600,,451,4.022471910112359
3521739,4,B001D261W0,"I LIKED THIS VIDEO , IT WAS GREAT AND THE TALKING WAS NOT A BOTHER .
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU LEARN/KNOW POSES BECAUSE IT CAN MOVE FAIRLY QUICKLY.
I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE INTERESETED IN STARTING YOGA",1377043200,,203,4.368421052631579
3521740,5,B001D261W0,"I love Muriel H. and Rodney Y. together! They are very down to earth and gentle in their instruction. The segments in this program are at a good pace, and can be combined for a longer workout if time allows. Good for the experienced yoga practitioner or beginners with some degree of fitness.",1376611200,,292,4.528301886792453
3521741,1,B001D261W0,"I've really grown to love Yoga over the past 6 months and have sought to broaden my Yoga DVD collection. I thought this DVD would be great for an early 15 minute session before work. I hated the DVD and didn't even finish the first workout. Yoga is supposed to be calm, relaxing spiritual...I thought Rodney and Mariel were too chatty for me to relax. I recommend Denise Austin Hot Body Yoga which was great for me as a beginner and continued to challenge myself to go deeper with each position.",1361923200,,495,4.450549450549451
3521742,2,B001D261W0,"This video is fast paced and does not give instructions for methods or form. If you are a beginner I think you could harm yourself. If you are advanced, you probably don't need it,",1353628800,,180,4.323529411764706
3521753,3,B001D261W0,"The four 15-minute videos are perfect for variety when I'm doing my morning yoga. This DVD gets the job done and I enjoy three out of the four routines. The core yoga routine is little to be desired but the other three are pretty good. The reason I only rated it three stars is the banter between the two of them. They chat during the yoga poses, they chat in between the yoga poses (sometimes so much you miss a cue and your still in downward dog while somehow they are in mountain pose), and they chat during final relaxation. It is pretty distracting and not so relaxing when they are explaining to you how relaxing and important final relaxation is during final relaxation. I'll continue to use this DVD until I find a replacement. If you are looking for a morning yoga tape this will work just beware of the banter.",1326931200,,820,4.401315789473684
3521754,5,B001D261W0,"After my 2nd child was born via c-section, I was unable to exercise. My mom brought this dvd with her during a short visit around 6 weeks post-op and forced me to follow along as much as I could. After her visit, I bought my own dvd and started implementing 15 minutes when both kids when down for nap time. Each day (or every other day), I was getting stronger and noticed that 15 minutes really was doing the trick.

About 3 months of doing the video (as often as possible), I was back at the Y for spin class. The next day, I expected to be in agony...nope. Not a sore muscle! I couldn't believe it and am a solid believer in this dvd.

15 minutes may seem trivial but it really does do the trick!

I love this dvd. I love that I can do 15 minutes of ""total"", ""upper"", ""lower"" or ""abs"" or 30 minutes or an hour. I love that the positions are not difficult to master thus feeling like a goof! I love how I can take a difficult group yoga class & hang with the top dogs! I love that I easily put this on my iPod & take it wherever I go. I love that I can't really talk myself out of doing 15 measly minutes!

Thanks GAIAM for putting out this dvd...I am now the one that forces this routine on my family & friends!",1322611200,,1215,3.9876543209876543
3521755,4,B001D261W0,"I really love Rodney Yee's yoga DVD's and this is a DVD I use perhaps once per week.  I don't mind the minimal comments between Rodney and Mariel as they seem genuine and are not distracting.  I found the amount of instruction adequate.  I skip the Total Body Conditioning segment and do the other three 15-min segments, one after the other, for one workout.  My only complaint is that the Upper Body Toning and Lower Body Sculpting are too similar but doing them both in one workout is not bad.  There are other better Yee yoga DVD's available but this one makes for a decent workout when you need something different.",1314489600,,619,4.54054054054054
3521756,2,B001D261W0,"I've practiced yoga for 13 years, and with a toddler at home I decided to try the 15-minute practice - I have always liked Rodney Yee's videos.

I started off with the ""Total Body"" workout, and wound up pulling the muscles of my left shoulder/neck less than 10 minutes in, during the spinal rolls. Five days later still hurts.  I should have known with all my yoga experience that spinal rolls so early in a practice is a really bad idea.

""15 minutes results"" might sound like a miracle because it is.  If you choose to buy this video, please note that you should do at least 10 minutes (5 - 8 sun salutations and some gentle stretching) of warming up beforehand.",1301788800,2,664,4.418032786885246
3521757,5,B001D261W0,"I started practicing yoga about a year and a half ago, but only have time for a long practice (1 to 1-1/2 hours) workout on Saturdays.  I love to fit these 15-20 minute practices in after a run on other mornings.  It's enough to keep up with flexibility and stretch out well after a run.  The instructors are easy to follow and offer alternate moves if you are not experienced at yoga.",1298764800,,385,4.319444444444445
3521758,5,B001D261W0,Rodney Yee is delightful in this series of workouts. I wish I could say the same for Muriel Hemningway whose presence seems rather bizarre and awkward but in general this dvd has helped me lose 15 pounds!  I do it between 3-4 times a week and it is a lifesaver.  It kickstarts your day in just the right way.,1292716800,,308,4.203389830508475
3521759,5,B001D261W0,"These are great for when you only have 15 minutes.  The banter between Rodney and Mariel can get old after a while, but I'm used to Rodney's quieter only talk when you must style.
After a while you get so used to a routine that you can just turn down the sound anyway.  This packs as much workout as you can get into 15 minute segments and if you're feeling motivated you can do 2 at a time.",1289779200,,391,4.0
3521760,5,B001D261W0,I really love this yoga video. I had taken it out of the library before I bought it and so I had used it several times already. It is the perfect video for short yoga practices - and you can do several of the sessions if you want a longer practice. The teachers work very well together. Everything is demonstrated so that you know exactly what to do.,1270598400,2,350,4.161764705882353
3521761,4,B001D261W0,"The quality is fine. The training is excellent, as always. I think I just prefer for him to work solo. Others may find the exercise less threatening and more user-friendly when he has a yoga partner.

It also may be that I was bored with this one because I've advanced further and need to stop buying yoga for beginners! I just have a habit of buying anything Rodney Yee puts together. I'm rarely disappointed and this one is okay, especially for those who are fairly new to yoga and are a little intimidated by starting yoga practice. It's friendly and pleasant.",1266364800,,563,4.574257425742574

8291045,4,B001D261W0,A cardio workout. This video is fast paced and has cardio as well as yoga moves. It goes through the moves quickly and gets your heart pumping. I purchased it as a step up from my beginner video. It was more cardio than I was expecting but I enjoyed the workout. I wouldn't recommend for begginers but you don't have to be an expert. Good for people looking for a workout that know a little yoga.,1497571200,,396,4.223684210526316
8291046,3,B001D261W0,"While this may be a great resource for an advanced yoga student, it was much too fast for a beginner. Plus, it's tough to do the postures and look at a video at the same time (a drawback of any such video).",1496620800,,206,3.9285714285714284

8291051,4,B001D261W0,"This is a good tape overall. I love yoga and have moderate experience and once you run through it one time it's easy to follow. They do pretty basic/beginner poses that are super relaxing. The only thing I don't like about it is Meredith. Both Rodney and her seem to bicker the entire time and it really takes your focus away from the actual yoga. Every time she says something he has a come back basically saying ""don't do what she just said"". Really throws you off! Overall it was still relaxing and energizing in the end so I would give it a shot.",1453075200,,550,4.298076923076923
