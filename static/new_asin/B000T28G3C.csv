8207254,4,B000T28G3C,"Ichigo is finally able to make a cannonball, the art needed to pierce the shield surrounding the Seireitei, the fortress of the Soul Reapers. He is able to do this after getting a few pointers from Ganju. He was the last one of his group comprised of Orihime, Chad, and Ishida that had yet to master it. And he still hasn't. While his cannonball packs a lot of power he lacks the skill needed to keep it under control so it tends to explode in his face. Nonetheless, time is running out for Rukia, and the group must rescue her before she is executed. Things don't go as planned when the cannonball gets stuck in the Soul Reaper shield, which causes it to explode and seperate our heroes. Chad and Yoruichi are by themselves, while Ishida is teamed up with the ever stumbling, ever ditzy Orihime. Ichigo lands with Ganju by his side, and they are the first to have to fight Soul Reapers, as they face off against the psychotic Ikkaku (he's not crazy, he just really likes to fight) and the overly vain Yumichika who is all about his looks. Even though both of them seem to have some major psychological hangups, make no mistake, they are deadly fighters, and perhaps too powerful for Ichigo and Ganju to handle.

You knew that Ichigo and friends were never going to make it to the Seireitei without getting seperated didn't you? Of course they had to be split up. It wouldn't have been any fun if they had arrived en masse and just started slugging their way to the tower where Rukia is being held. No, they had to be split up so their powers could be diluted and they would have to face foes whose powers might be stronger on an individual level. Through these battles we get to see if our main characters have indeed grown stronger or whether they've just been talking the talk. It's great to see them all rise to the challenge, albeit in very different ways. For example, Ichigo relies on his enormous spiritual energy and his enemy's tendency to underestimate his skills while Ganju uses his speed, wit, and guile to fight. Volume 7 of Bleach was quite good in spite of the fact that maybe some of the fights were a bit too long. But Noriyuki Abe keeps you engaged with some very well orchestrated battle sequences, choreographed with little or no static action lines. He always keeps a sense of coolness about the characters as he reveals their new powers with dramatic relish.",1218412800,,2382,4.513888888888889
8207255,4,B000T28G3C,"A lot of things are going on in this volume but not much actually happens. The characters are in a brand new situation and the audience is getting to see brand new reactions from them. Now the audience is seeing what the characters would do in a brand new life threatening situation while we work our way towards the next big opponent. The action on this volume is strong but to be honest, I'm much more interested in seeing what is going to happen on the next volume with Uryo and Orihime. In other words, I enjoyed this volume but I didn't feel like I gained a lot of ground in terms of the story. Recommended for fans.",1216771200,,621,4.271186440677966
8207256,4,B000T28G3C,"Most of ""Bleach Volume 6"" was spent trying to get into the Soul Reaper fortress, the Seireitei.

Well, ""Bleach Volume 7"" is about what our heroes do when they manage to get inside, and discover that they've got hundreds of Soul Reapers ready to take them out. Obviously there's lots of action and fighting, but plenty of humour in the fights as well.

Once our heroes have finally learned to form ""cannonballs"" with their spirit energy, Shikaku Kiba uses her massive cannon to fire the group (plus her brother Ganju) into the Seireitei through the air. But things don't go quite as planned -- they all get blasted in different directions, landing in completely different parts of the Seireitei.

Ichigo and Ganju are promptly challenged by a pair of Soul Reapers -- Ichigo fights the bald, dancing swordsman Ikkaku, and Ganju the fey, narcissistic Yumichika. Chad and the cat Yoruichi are apparently in hiding, but Uryu shows off his new powers when another giant threatens Orihime. Oh yes, and the condemned Rukia is sitting in the Repentence Cell, waiting to be executed.

See, this DVD reminds me exactly why I find ""Bleach"" so entertaining. While the first episode drags somewhat -- come on, GET INSIDE already! -- things pick up wonderfully as soon as Ichigo and Company hit the ground. After that, there's lots of action, comedy, headless-chicken chase scenes, and new Soul Reapers who love fighting and have feathered eyebrows.

The plot in this one is a bit scattered, since the characters are. But there are some nice kinetic action scenes with Ichigo and Ikkaku, where both combatants are slashing each other up, as well as Uryu showing what new Quincy powers he's developed when nobody was looking. Chivalry appears to be his middle name.

But it's not all action -- there's plenty of comedy woven in. Ikkaku and Yumichika provide most of it -- one of them claims he's going to kill Ganju because he's ""ugly,"" and the other does goofy celebration dances on his tiptoes (""Who is lucky? I am lucky! None so lucky but... MEEEEEEEEE!""). He's even funny in defeat (""Agh! You made me laugh so hard I reopened my wounds!"").

And this time around, we get some focus on the Soul Reapers rather than Our Heroes. Ikkaku and Yumichika show that the Soul Reapers can actually be quirky, if not outright bizarre. And we see some hints of new dimensions to Renji, the tattooed Soul Reaper who is an old friend of Rukia's -- let's just say that there are hints that Renji is getting rebellious.

The seventh volume of ""Bleach"" is full of action and comedy, with some important new characters introduced in the Soul Society. And things will only get hotter.",1199836800,2,2651,4.77292576419214
