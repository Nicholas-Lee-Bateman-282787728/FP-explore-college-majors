8291269,4,B001D263IW,"This aired during the early days of United States TV (1949-1950). These four episodes are interesting to say the least, even if the sound and picture quality is poor (even when compared with other efforts of the time like ""The School House"" and ""Texaco Star Theatre""). Nevertheless, it's a moderately amusing series, basically a variety show. Just for those who want to know what appears:
Episode 1: Guest star Gloria Swanson and two singers who names escape me
Episode 2: Guest stars The Three Stooges
Episode 3: Guest star Vera Vague (an actress who was very popular but somehow forgotten today. This episode verges on being surreal at times)
Episode 4: Guest stars Buddy Epsen and Hattie McDaniel (though the two don't appear together. Hattie plays the character ""Beulah the Maid"" from radio, luckily isn't as offensive as it could have been even if it isn't exactly a plea for tolerance. She sings a song, which is unexpected to say the least).

Though the writing is uneven and at times verges on cloying, this short-lived series has a slight charm and will probably be enjoyed by those curious about early United States comedy-variety series.

(Note: Contains a couple of original commercials, for both Camel cigerattes and a brand of replacement watch bands. These commercials are actually among the very weakest I've seen from this period).",1252454400,3,1348,4.986666666666666
