Interesting ... can't go wrong with readers digest ...",1397606400,,107,4.4
8237423,5,B00109U87U,The walks are very good and I love them. A great purchase. I would recommend it to all treadmill walkers.,1380672000,,105,4.3
8237424,5,B00109U87U,The scenery is beautiful on the dvds!  Makes you feel like you are visiting each of these places in person! Makes boring exercise so much more entertaining!!!,1361577600,,158,4.851851851851852
8237425,3,B00109U87U,The first several volumes were really good.  You are taken through hikes through different areas of the world as advertised.  The last several volumes are too touristy and go away from the walking themes.  The video quality on the last several volumes also are not as good as the first volumes.,1361145600,2,294,4.7254901960784315
8237426,2,B00109U87U,"When I buy a DVD that suggests its contents are probably about walking and scenic areas, it is rather disappointing to find that at least half the filming has absolutely nothing to do with walking. I may as well have bought a series called Scenic Wonders of the World - but I can borrow those from my local library for free.
It is also disappointing that the contents of the first disc list a walk thru the beautiful Tongariro National Park in New Zealand's North Island, but what you actually get is the Hollyford Track in the South Island, so not much attention to editorial detail there.
I must say that the contents and filming of the real walks was very well done. It's just a pity there was so little of it. I had been really looking forward to some brisk armchair walking, and feel quite let down that I didn't get much exercise at all.",1303171200,11,843,4.375796178343949
8237427,4,B00109U87U,"These are beautifully filmed dvds about beautiful places on our planet. This world has a lot of disturbing and frightening things going on ..... to be able to sit down and watch amazingly beautiful places, even if one turns off the sound and the words completely, helps to rebalance us and make us feel better. I am looking  to buy these dvds just for that reason.",1276992000,2,364,4.515151515151516
8237428,2,B00109U87U,"First, it's misnamed: although there are several scenic multi-day walks depicted, about half the locations visited are drive-up tourist destinations like the Taj Majal. Second, the writing is uninspired, with the narrator intoning generic phrases like, ""It is one of the most spectacular views in the world"" for virtually every location - you get the sense they could have put some of the narration behind any of the locations and it would have made no difference. I watched it through a couple of times and donated it to a library.",1265328000,15,532,4.9222222222222225
8237429,5,B00109U87U,"I got this for my father for his birthday, he loved it. He says he takes a vacation and doesn't leave his recliner. Please continue to offer these wonderful videos.",1240617600,8,164,4.5
