2643582,5,B000HT389O,"Warner Brothers is to be commended for assembling this triple feature set of classic Randolph Scott films on a single two-sided DVD. Although this is not Scott's best work -- have a look at ""7 Men from Now"" or ""Ride the High Country"" -- these B-westerns are very, very entertaining and are not to be missed by any fan of westerns or good stories.

The early 1950s Technicolor looks great and the transfers appear to have been made from very good source materials. I only wish WB would have made at least a bare bones scene selection menu and/or added trailers for these and other Scott films. Also, anamorphically enhanced transfers would be nice considering the current proliferation of 16x9 monitors.

I shied away from buying this disc initially because these are indeed B-movies and not Scott's best work but I found them to be very, very enjoyable westerns. So much so that I'm ordering the other WB set of Scott's westerns. Sit back, relax and allow yourself to watch Randolph Scott ride again! (Pass me the popcorn, please.)
-----
Reissued with the addition of ""Ride the High Country"" -- Scott's last film and one of his absolute best -- arguably *the* best. Right up there with ""7 Men from Now"" and ""Ride Lonesome"". An incredible bargain on DVD.

Westerns featured here are COLT 45 (1950), FORT WORTH (1951) and TALL MAN RIDING  (1955) All are fine examples of B-Westerns from the best decade of the genre, starring stoic hero Randolph Scott perhaps the genres greatest exponent! A fine supporting cast in all three. Including the likes of David Brian, Zachary Scott, & Dorothy Malone (Peyton Place). Well-over four hours of western drama in glorious Technicolor. Best of the Three for me is TALL MAN RIDING. Good quality DVD transfers and all at a bargain price from Amazon.

2643584,4,B000HT389O,"Two pretty good films and one passable one. Tall Man Riding and Fort Worth good stories and decent performances with sufficient action. Our man Scott is fine in all three. Colt. 45 was good story but Zachary Scott who played the bad guy was so over the top you wonder why any other individual, villan or otherwise, would have followed this guy anywhere. Good to see some of the earlier Scott films show up on DVD. And I was always a fan of the horse he rode in many of his films, a dark palamino with white mane and tail with white blaze on his face. One of the most attractive horses in film. Transfers are great for early 50's fare. No widecreen here but great and vivid color. I bought it and am pleased I did. Now just wish some of Scott's later films like Tall T, Commanche Station and Ride Lonesome would be released.",1165708800,7,823,4.282051282051282
2643585,5,B000HT389O,"This is one of two triple feature Randolph Scott Western DVDs produced by Warner Brothers. This is a great collection, featuring two very solid Scott Westerns, Colt .45 and Fort Worth, plus one of his very best, Tall Man Riding.

Fort Worth features Scott as a newspaperman who publishes a newspaper to the detriment of outlaw Ray Teal and his gang. Scott is also not sure he can trust an old friend played by David Brian, who is Fort Worth's leading citizen. The movie keeps you guessing about Brian's true intentions right up to the end of the film. A solid film with entertaining performances from Scott, Brian, Teal, and Phyllis Thaxter.

Colt .45 is even better. It stars Scott as a gun salesman working to recover two .45s from an outlaw who stole them from Scott and started a crime spree. Scott, Ruth Roman, Zachary Scott (as the villain), Alan Hale, Chief Thundercloud, and Lloyd Bridges make up a wonderful cast.

But the best film on the DVD is Tall Man Riding, which proves that Scott had the secret to the formula that worked so well in his films with great director Budd Boetticher, who directed Scott in most of his best films, including Seven Men From Now, The Tall T, Ride Lonesome, and Comanche Station. This film has a lot of the same elements of the Scott/Boetticher films - a hero bent on revenge, torn between a woman from his past and a woman in his present who is drawn to help him, overwhelming forces against him, and a great twist to the story.

In Tall Man Riding, Scott plays a cowboy back in town after five years. Back then, he was dating the daughter of the most powerful rancher in town, but was whipped and driven out of town by the rancher. Scott comes back to town seeking revenge as the rancher is fighting it out with the local saloon owner for control of the territory. Scott's ex, played by Dorothy Malone, has remarried, and Scott accidently comes to her husband's rescue. Soon, Scott finds himself in the middle of the war between the rancher and the saloon owner, and between his old love and the saloon owner's girl, who provides Scott with valuable information.

This film features great acting, writing, and lots of action. It actually ranks its own release on DVD, but if this was the only way that Scott fans could get it on DVd, it's worth it to buy it with two other fine films. But Tall Man Riding all by itself makes this collection worth owning.",1164585600,38,2398,4.516129032258065

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young, ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956) with Lee Marvin, ""The Tall T"" (1957) with Richard Boone, ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957) with James Garner, and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne

But this no-frills set (decent transfers, no extras) is very nearly as good and it helps to show the richness of Scott's western filmography as well as anything up until the fabulous Budd Boetticher films at the end of the decade that capped his career so memorably.  This is what you get here:

COLT .45 (1950, directed by Edwin L. Marin)
Steve Farrell (Randolph Scott) is a salesman for the Colt company, peddling the new, expensive and game-changing .45 revolver to lawmen in the 1840s. In the first scene in the film, Jason Brett (Zachary Scott), a young punk in jail on a minor charge, manages to kill the sheriff as Farrell is doing his spiel, and make off with a pair of the .45s. The wounded deputy and the rest of the town think Farrell was in cahoots with Brett and lock him up for several months, by which time Brett has blazed a trail of terror for which Farrell feels responsible - and it's time to bring him to justice. Soon he makes friends with an Indian Chief (Chief Thundercloud) whose people Brett is framing for stagecoach robberies, and manages to save a stage from a robbery - despite the attempted interference by Beth Donovan (Ruth Roman) who it turns out is being held along with her husband Paul (Lloyd Bridges) while the bandits hide out at their cabin. Farrell, meanwhile, ends up in the town of Bonanza Creek as deputy to the shady Sheriff Harris (Alan Hale), trying to figure out how to bring Brett to justice even as he is being conspired against.

This is a solid, very fast-paced affair directed by Edward Marin - who directed Randolph Scott in the same number of films that Henry Hathway did, eight - more than the better-known and more-respected Andre de Toth or Budd Boetticher. I've just seen two others (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-Eve/dp/B0013HPC3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas Eve</a>&nbsp;and the reviewed-below FORT WORTH), and they're all competent and fast-moving b-pictures - not remarkable, but deserving of more attention than they get.  This one I think is most notable for Zachary Scott's fun, sneering, absolutely amoral villain, and for the amount of time Randolph Scott spends smiling - a heckuva lot more than he ever would do for Boetticher. It's got decent color and music, and the rest of the acting is fine, but it's fairly cheap-looking, the costumes often look way off, and there are a few rather stupid moments - like the initial fight in the jail that leads to Brett getting the revolvers - that really come off as quickie ways to move the brief (74 minutes) film along rather than well-though-out narrative choices. It's also notable in having a generally positive portrayal of natives, in the same year as the much more-heralded Broken Arrow.

TALL MAN RIDING (1955, directed by Lesley Selander)
Despite the very generic title, and the relatively generic basic plotline (man seeking revenge against cattle baron who wronged him is caught in a more complex battle involving the local town's big cheese and his corrupt deputy (strangely there's no sheriff), and two women who both love or admire him), this 82-minute whip-fast specimen comes off as reasonably interesting in execution. Selander isn't a particularly exciting or inventive director, and the chase sequences and shootouts (apart from one that I'll get to) aren't any more wonderful than his tepid camerawork in the film as a whole, but the cast and the rapid pacing make up for this well enough.

Larry Madden (Scott) is the tall man who rides towards the town of Little River and his past; he's moseying along until he hears gunshots, and decides to help out in a one man against three situation, eventually shooting one of the besiegers and saving the would-be victim - who he finds out is a man from the hated Tuck Ordway's Warbonnet ranch (so much for shooting first and asking questions later). Soon we find out that Madden was once sweet on Ordway's daughter, but the old man didn't think he was good enough for her, and drove him out of town - with a whip! Likewise angry enough with Ordway to kill him is Cibo Pearlo (John Baragrey), owner of the biggest saloon in town and also possessing (in his mind at leat) Reva (Peggie Castle) whose friendship with Ordway's daughter Corinna (Dorothy Malone) complicates matters - as Madden's history with Corinna will come into play.

Boasting some fine work by John Dehner as (what else) a sleazy lawyer as well, and decent location work, TALL MAN RIDING may not be one of Scott's best films, but like everything I've seen with him in the 50s it's economical and well-crafted, somehow packing loads of action and riding back and forth, a couple of romances and a land rush sequence into it's brief running time. And it has a few standout scenes - in this case a gunfight in a dark room that's quite suspenseful, and a terrific knock-down, drag-out fight between Madden and the good-for-nothing deputy Barclay (Mickey Simpson). Oh and there's also the rather oily and nasty Peso Kid (Paul Richards) who gets a few memorable lines and a good if brief showdown in the street.

FORT WORTH (1951, directed by Edward L. Marin)
Last and I think possibly the best on this triple-decker is this newspaperman-fights-corruption story, with Scott as ex-cattleman and gunslinger Ned Britt, now a newspaper editor on his way to San Antonio to start up a new paper with partner Ben Garvin (Emerson Treacy) and their young apprentice Luther (Dickie Jones). They're travelling with a wagon train of settlers bound for Fort Worth, and at the beginning of the film they run into a couple of old acquaintances of Ned's, one welcome and the obvious love interest to-be - Flora Talbot (Phyllis Thaxter) - and the other not so welcome, troublemaker Gabe Clevenger (Ray Teal), who with his gang cause a stampede which results in a loss of life. We get an early example of this film's awesome punchy over-the-top dialogue (by John Twist - but it comes off as more than a little like Sam Fuller to me) when Clevenger tells one of his men, ""he throws lead, jughead - type! And it's got plenty scatter to it.""

Britt and Garvin eventually decide to detour and set up shop in Fort Worth instead of San Antonio - partly due to the charm of Ms. Talbot, and partly due to the influence of the engaging Blair Lunsford (David Brian), her fiancee. Fort Worth is hurting, it's population down, a promised railroad not coming through. But Lunsford's got great plans, and Garvin and Britt decide they're up for the challeng of running a paper in a town that NEEDS one. Unfortunately, Clevenger and his outlaw gang, an ineffective sherrif, and Lunsford himself - who isn't exactly what he seems at first - all end up causing plenty of problems, and make Britt soon unable to leave his six-guns locked away.

As I said, the dialogue here is just crackling - another good line, as Britt pushes Luther away from covering a story that's too dangerous, while strapping on his irons: ""you don't cover that story with a pencil""; and referring to the man who gradually becomes his nemesis, ""his crooked dream got too big for one man to hold."" The action is punchy too, with a great little trick shootout at a corral - just after the first quote I gave - being a highlight. The film of course is implicitly about the coming of civilization and the taming of the west - trains and newspapers and cattlemen and cities replacing gunslingers and small towns - but it isn't terribly serious about it's themes and is mostly a great showpiece for a fine group of less well-known character actors. The 6'4"" Brian is meant to be Scott's equal/opposite/dark side and does a better job of conveying this than many of Randy's adversaries in other films; Teal played a lot of scuzzy villains and does fine here; and Treacy is just wonderful as Britt's more cynical and wiser partner, who imparts some good wisdom in his short time on camera - he comes off a bit like a James Gleason character from a decade earlier.  But Scott actually gets a good chunk of the most colorful dialogue and most of the best scenes, and he shows throughout why he's the star. This one doesn't add up to a lot besides just ""fun"", but it's a rip-roaring example of that.",1287014400,3,8650,4.8609226594301225

2643616,5,B000HT389O,"You must experience the sheer magic in these gloriously produced vintage westers. Randolph Scott epitomizes the classic western heroe in a memorable way. I encourage everyone to study the work of Randolph Scott.
As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, comedies, musicals (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, war films, and even a few horror and fantasy films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle Western hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances more than 60 were in Westerns; thus, ""of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.""[1]

Scott's more than thirty years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working frequently with many acclaimed screen directors, including Henry King, Rouben Mamoulian, Michael Curtiz, John Cromwell, King Vidor, Alan Dwan, Fritz Lang, and Sam Peckinpah. He also worked on multiple occasions with some noted directors: Henry Hathaway (8 times), Ray Enright (7), Edwin R. Marin (7), Andre DeToth (6), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with Budd Boetticher.

Scott also worked with a widely diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from Shirley Temple and Irene Dunne to Mae West and Marlene Dietrich. He also appeared with Gene Tierney, Ann Sheridan, Maureen O'Hara, Nancy Carroll, Donna Reed, Gail Russell, Margaret Sullavan, Virginia Mayo, Bebe Daniels, Carole Lombard, and Joan Bennett.

Tall (6 ft 2 in; 188 cm), lanky, and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or ""lumbering"".[2] As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal ""strong, silent"" type of stoic hero. The BFI Companion to the Western noted:

In his earlier Westerns ... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.[1]

During the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual Motion Picture Herald Top Ten Polls, he ranked tenth in 1950, eighth in 1951, and again tenth in 1952.[3]

In a comic moment in the Western spoof Blazing Saddles directed by Mel Brooks, when the townspeople refuse to support the town's sheriff, they relent after the sheriff tells them: ""You'd do it for Randolph Scott.""",1235779200,,2776,5.171492204899777
2643617,3,B000HT389O,"This dvd is worth what I paid for it. I bought it for the colt .45 movie alone, I liked the title! The colt. 45 movie was okay, but was not at all accurate. In the movie, Randolph Scott is a gun salesman, and has two of his prized colts stolen, but they are actually colt dragoons, an earlier cap-n-ball style percussion revolver. What is usually meant by a ""colt. 45"" is an 1873 colt peacemaker in .45 colt caliber. I really liked ""fort worth"", it was the best of the three movies. For fans of early westerns, and Randolph Scott, this movie pack is a good deal.",1221868800,,562,4.212962962962963

Made from outstanding source materials, the dvd picture quality is excellent.  No, Boetticher did not direct any of these three films but they do have the adult attitude of those Scott westerns.  The price is also impossible to beat for three entertaining films.  If you are 50-something and enjoyed westerns as a kid, I think you will be happy with this purchase

2643620,5,B000HT389O,"Fort Worth and Tall Man Riding are two of the best of the Crooked Businessman subgenre of Westerns. In particular, Tall Man Riding is very
well plotted and most enjoyable.
Colt 45 is what I call a Saturday afternoon Western.  A lot of disbelief has to be suspended to get into it.  Native Americans speak with excellent use of nouns and verbs but no articles, although at least they are not the villains.  For the heavy, we have none other than Zachary Scott and his performance is wonderfully over the top.  Overacting is not the word. He is totally psychotic and possibly even sets new standards in Western villainy.

All three films have great picture quality and terrific Warner Brothers Ranch/Chatsworth location photography.

There's little that can be said about Randolph Scott that hasn't already been said.  Because he did so many of these so-called B Westerns he may have been underrated by snobbier critics.  I think he was a really great actor.

Highly recommended.",1206662400,2,977,4.872727272727273

You get three pretty good movies for the price of one.  The movie transfers are crystal clear and even more beautiful than I remembered.  The photography in the western of this time is some of the finest I have seen.  The stories are not just good guy against bad guy, they are a little more than that.  Randolph Scott is a prototypical cowboy.  Tall and lean with a hint of swagger and accent.  Make no mistake though, he never protrayed a cowboy as a gunslinger.
