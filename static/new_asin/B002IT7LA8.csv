8371148,5,B002IT7LA8,"In France, an overworked gynecologist and his married male buddy decide that they need to go on a short holiday sans women, to enjoy a few simple ""guy things"" like hiking and camping.  But they soon find themselves followed and hounded by their wives, and ultimately all other women who spot them during their increasingly furitive sojourn.

Directed by Bertrand Blier (also director of the fine comedy ""Get Out Your Handerchiefs""-1978), ""Calmos"" (1976/77) includes a performance by his father, veteran actor Bernard Blier, as a priest who betrays them... with music by George Delarue and photography by Claude Renoir.  Accidentally catching this very funny French language film years ago in an English subtitled screen version, it includes some nudity and some mature situations and language.

Apparently currently available on DVD only in the non-subtitled PAL French language original, it is still worth watching on your computer, especially
if you understand French.  I hope that an English subtitled NTSC DVD copy will soon be made available for the rest of us, because this is a saucy and most fun film.

I don't think that any contemporary movies can even approach this level of exposition.  I will never think of Cyrano in the same way.  Do what you can to get a copy if you have found yourself enjoying the more mainstream Blier like ""Un, Deux, Trois, Soleil!"".",1364860800,4,398,4.410958904109589
