2658697,4,B000IJ7AEC,"This season was up the high standard set by the previous three in my opinion. The great things about this show are the British perspective and also the fact that no character seems sacred. On the other hand, the fact that no character is sacred is also a bit of a short comming. I would like to see a little bit more character continuity, but overall still a great show. Only the Brits would have an episode dreaming up a conspiracy within the British intelligence services to knock off Princess Di!",1169078400,4,499,4.4945054945054945
2658698,5,B000IJ7AEC,"This series captures the best of the thriller, English spy game with plots that reflect current global events. It is a roller coaster thrill ride with every new episode, and unlike American TV drama, they aren't afraid to put key characters in mortal danger. Highly recommended.",1167955200,20,278,5.065217391304348
2658699,4,B000IJ7AEC,"The fourth series of MI-5 (Spooks) packs a slightly lesser punch than the previous three, but fascinating and entertaining nonetheless.

For my money, this series leaves stuff like 24 at the starting gate - it retains a good grip of the real world and does not treat other countries as either idiotic or as a fiefdom. The fact that the series is working through its' second team of actors is edge of the seat stuff and validates plotlines nicely.

The issues of state sponsored torture, big brother, personal privacy and civil rights are raised throughout, but never challenged to any great extent.

Well produced, slick and gives Mr Bond a run for his money.",1167436800,51,659,4.7631578947368425

2658735,5,B000IJ7AEC,"Who comes up with these stories? They are great! I discovered the series on Amazon Prime and instantly became a fan. The writing and productions are just dark enough to be believable without becoming completely depressing. The acting is superb, though the dialect coach could have done better when it came to the Russian accents. The primary characters each go through realistic arcs as their individual traits are hammered and tempered by the demands of their work assignments. The line between the good guys and the bad guys is kept just fuzzy enough to show that human nature is fundamentally gray in color. Adam is one of Rupert Penry Jones' best characters.

I watched the first eight seasons that were free on Amazon Prime and am ready to purchase the DVDs of the final two seasons. I periodically rewatch various episodes to appreciate the way in which the writers construct the stories and develop the characters. The directing is solid and the technical elements are very well done.

Thank you, Amazon Prime!",1419292800,,1017,4.906976744186046

The rest of the cast is great too, Peter Firth as Harry and Ruth.  Particularly liked the way no commercials were introduced, at least on the DVD.

2658743,5,B000IJ7AEC,Very exciting series. This gives a different perspective on world situation and how the U.S. is perceived as well as how the UK deals with problems and their politics. Rupert Penry-Jones is easy on the eyes too.,1377475200,,211,4.72972972972973
2658744,4,B000IJ7AEC,Don;t get attached to anyone. Brits kills off their stars like no one else. Amazon started charging for the series when we were half way through. The other red colored bunch has it all. Well written and acted. Just be warned no one is sacred.,1371081600,,242,4.4

2658746,1,B000IJ7AEC,"I have been enjoying this series until Volume 4. Then I realized even BBC is sometimes trying to indirectly affect its audiences. For example, they have intentionally used the word ""Arabian Gulf"" instead of the well known ""Persian Gulf""; and surprisingly, this coincided with the western sanctions against Iran! If you look at some of the episodes, there are countless examples that give a very bad picture of MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES. I wish BBC was different from others, but apparently it is not!

I never thought I would like this show as much as 24, but once past the 1st episode in season one (which was a little lame), this has certainly out paced Jack Bauer. The story lines are ever changing, so they tiresome as they became in 24. If you are a serious Keifer Sutherland fan, you might not like it as much.

Although I miss Tom Quinn and Danny Hunter, I'm settling in with Adam and Fiona.  Zoe was a bit too hyper and argumentive for my tastes, but Fiona is a cool, calm, and collective operative.  I hopes she sticks around for long time.  This is a must see series.",1339891200,,521,4.17

2658765,5,B000IJ7AEC,"Moving into its Fourth Season, MI-5 retains its seemingly impossible-to-achieve status as one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. ""MI-5"" is about a group of British citizen individuals who join ""5"" to help ""defend the realm."" (MI-5 is that branch of the British secret service that is focused on domestic threats, be they economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK; a sister branch, MI-6, not a part of this show, deals more exclusively with external threats to the country.) The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally real--and shows how the members of 5 must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.

Season Four again focuses on a new series of threats to the UK, and, perhaps more than any other season to date, has a ""thematic"" flavor that carries through the entire season. And although it seems increasingly impossible that the show could ever match the emotional excitement and achievement of each last season, Season Four raises the bar once again and seems to defy all ""regression to the mean."" I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. That's what MI-5 is like as you enter the third and fourth seasons.

Because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.

This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these IN ORDER. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of Season One.",1325635200,6,4007,4.746054519368723

2658767,5,B000IJ7AEC,"As I have previously stated on this board. I became a huge fan of the fine BBC spy/thriller MI-5 starting with Season Seven (7) and became so very addicted to the series that I started viewing the past seasons.  Now  I am ""up to"" Season four (4) of catching up to the current season of MI-5 , I am still very much thrilled with this super intense British ""high tech"" spy thriller.  Season four (4) of MI-5 is so finely done that it kept me poised on ""the edge of my seat"" in anticipation of ""what happens next"" and/or how is this terrible ""espionage problem ""going to be solved plus I was ""blown away"" with all of the extreme ""high tech"" gadgets that the spies have at their disposal in season four (4).

Season four (4) of MI-5 contains ten (10) very well written, wonderfully directed and fabulously acted episodes on five (5) discs,  My god, the episodes are so good.  I was always trying to differentiate the ""good"" characters from the ""bad"" characters.  One can never, at first, determine if a character is really what he/she says she/he is--a lot of ""double agents"" to keep the viewing audience guessing and surprised.  A very fine season indeed, although I ""lost"" many of my favorite characters through tragic circumstances.  I look forward to the next seasons--I am truly ""hooked"".",1323043200,4,1289,4.618421052631579
2658768,5,B000IJ7AEC,this series is very well written and highly addicting. once you start you can't stop. my favorite years were the 'Adam Carter' years but it is all excellent,1320710400,,156,4.607142857142857
2658769,5,B000IJ7AEC,"Spooks or MI-5 is the best series about spies I have ever seen. British do know how to do the whole complot involving the british intelligence service and every other spy from Rusia to US.If you love high speed /suspense series ,you must buy this one. It is a shame that has ended already in UK.",1320278400,2,295,4.285714285714286
2658770,4,B000IJ7AEC,"I can't get enough of MI-5 and our gang of ""good"" spies trying to save Britain from domestic and foreign terrorists. There is never a dull moment at the Thames House, the MI-5 Headquarters in London. The stories can seem repititious with fundamentalist terrorists trying to control the world or seek revenge sprinkled in are the formerly ""good"" spies who have now turned to the dark side.
The constant character shift in MI-5 is amazing. Characters are killed or are sent away. No ones enter the picture. It is a constant shift. Peter Firth as Harry Pearce, the head of the MI-5, is the one constant and the glue that binds the series together. Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed is my favorite. Lovely, insecure yet amazingly skilled with computer skills, Ruth is the other keystone in the series.
The stories can be over the top but there is a fun to it and the series is addictive. Unlike in US shows, we usually know very quickly who the criminals are. With London's maize of close circuit TV cameras, every crime is caught on video. Add in MI-5's amazing Facial Recognition technology and the terrorist has a name. Our MI-5 spies are adept at breaking into homes and placing secret cameras and audio bugs. With all this technology, it still takes time to get the evidence needed for an arrest.
The last episode leaves us with a serious cliff hanger. I have to hurry and get Season 5 to see what happens. A former spy has gone wild with ""proof"" that the MI-5 was responsible for Princess Diana's death. What is the real truth?
Season 4 did not delve as much into the personal lives and conflicts of the spies and the previous seasons, although there is one major cast change and the emotional conflict this causes.
The series if fun and addictive. It is far from perfect but it has charm and adventure.",1317600000,3,1802,4.58204334365325
2658771,4,B000IJ7AEC,It was quite good but I'm getting tired of all the main characters leaving or getting killed off. Is it really necessary?,1208649600,4,121,4.545454545454546
2658772,5,B000IJ7AEC,"We love MI-5.  Can't believe we have to wait almost a year for next season.
Great writing, really good acting.  Totally rocks.

One thing that really sets this series apart is their willingness to kill off regulars",1204243200,2,214,4.72972972972973
2658773,5,B000IJ7AEC,"As always, MI-5 does not offer cheap thrills or gauranteed success of ""good"" over ""evil"". Almost all episodes remain complex and often morally ambiguous, with everybody paying the price.",1199664000,2,186,5.448275862068965
2658774,5,B000IJ7AEC,"Season 4 did not disappoint...

Like a lot of other fans, we first caught MI-5 on A&E and BBC America, but couldn't watch it consistently. DVD Boxsets are a God-send. My wife and I blazed through the first 3 seasons between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and just finished Series 4 a couple days ago. Thank goodness Series 5 will be out next week, because I don't think we could wait too long to see how the cliff-hanger gets resolved.

I'm a huge fan of the way the show tackles all the thorny issues that go hand-in-hand with fighting enemies, who have declared to the world that your destruction is their reason for being.

The themes that run through Series 4, are all too real -- Abuse of power, misuse of intelligence agencies for political purposes, controlling/manipulating the media, disillusioned officers, etc., etc., etc..

The episodes are written in a fast-paced manner, and the emotional impact of each crisis on the officers' humanity, as well as on the victims and conspirators is always obvious. This isn't a show where violence is gratuitously presented; it's always the honest, realistic result of the circumstances leading up to it.

There are moments where we are reminded that spooks are a breed-apart, and dispite the temptation to romanticize them, there's a great deal of pain (physcial and psychological) that goes with the territory. Spooks lie for a living, but they also have to be singularly brilliant to get the best of fanatics, psychopathic-killers, and homicidal-idealists, hell-bent on raining terror down on society.

MI-5 is a great show, and Series 4 did not disappoint.",1199404800,9,1606,4.99625468164794
2658775,5,B000IJ7AEC,"This is a great series:  Well-written, great presentations, strong acting and very intelligent.  Many controversial issues involved in the world of counterintelligence or the so-called ""War on Terror"" are addressed thoughtfully and with more balance than in shows heavy in propaganda (e.g. ""24"").",1196812800,2,296,5.8604651162790695
2658776,5,B000IJ7AEC,"Wife and I fell in love with this show, and the fourth season is just as enjoyable as the previous three.",1193270400,2,105,4.0476190476190474
2658777,4,B000IJ7AEC,"The energy of this series starts out strong and doesn't flag through the series ten episdoes. It's hard to compare to the first seasons, since hardly any of the cast is left. Is killing off or retiring characters due to burn-out becoming a crutch to create drama in the program? So far, it doesn't seem to have hurt.

I think they've picked up the pace of action in season four. In many of the climaxes they are fighting a ticking clock down to the final seconds. Episodes from earlier seasons seem to develop at a bit more leisurely pace, which is more realistic, but less riveting.

Whereas 24 has gone downhill over 6 seasons, MI-5 has improved. This may be the best espionage series on TV. If you liked previous seasons, there is no reason you shouldn't like season four.",1193011200,6,775,4.5285714285714285
2658778,5,B000IJ7AEC,"The writers of MI-5 have kept up their high quality into the fourth season.  Characters come and go, but the series never misses a step and keeps this viewer interested, entertained and looking forward to more.  The variety of credible threats to the UK never ceases to amaze me.

This is the ONLY Television series I have ever purchased, and I share it with a couple of friends who are also hooked on MI-5!",1192752000,5,407,4.472972972972973
2658779,5,B000IJ7AEC,"While I found it hard to lose most of the original main characters from the first 3 years, season 4 still delivers a great series that is head and shoulders above 24 and anything else on U.S. television. Also, as of the date of this review I have discovered (much to my delight) that BBC America has picked up MI-5 and is showing it from the beginning. The bad news is, they seem to be putting in even more commercials than A&E did.  However, that just makes viewing the DVD version that much more enjoyable.",1182470400,6,508,4.347368421052631
2658780,5,B000IJ7AEC,"It's too bad that A&E dumped the series to a one day extravaganza.  One of the best shows of its genre, it deserves to be owned. Unforntunately it does appear next season will be picked up by A&E, so, fans stay alert for the DVD release.",1175385600,14,237,4.1521739130434785
2658781,5,B000IJ7AEC,"Why, Why, Why does a US cable station not pick up this wonderful show. A&E showed the first 3 seasons but even them, it was when A&E decided and did not really care if anyone watched.

This show, espec. seasons 1 & 2 are miles ahead of anything else on US television today.

My recommendation, buy all 4 box sets, get tons of popcorn and spend your entire weekend watching a 10 out of 10 show.",1174262400,25,393,4.157894736842105

2658783,5,B000IJ7AEC,This series was everything I expected and more. When A&E cancelled it I was very disappointed.

2658786,5,B000IJ7AEC,"After three seasons of a series one always wonders if a formula becomes old.... not so with SPOOKS. The fourth series is definitely worthy of the other three, with some excellent new cast members and tension-filled episodes, that introduce terrorist plots to destabilize the country by different British and foreign cells (and not just Muslim fundamentalists). Moreover, throughout the season MI-5 gets increasing competition from other government agencies and is pressured to slowly infringe on the privacy of citizens. It makes the leading characters and the viewer wonder: when does the good guy become a bad guy, or is everything allowed in the war on terror?",1172016000,10,663,5.264150943396227

2658789,3,B000IJ7AEC,"the first three seasons of mi-5 are great entertainment. well written, well acted, unpredictable, and believable. now, the writing is definitely from the b-team, the acting by some of the ensemble is poor, the end of the story is definitely predictable to anyone awake and thinking, and some of the plot devices are not believable at all. the episode about the smuggler truck from istanbul was especially risible. maybe they will kill off some of the lame actor's characters, and the producers will put a well earned boot up the writers' arses. too good an idea to let die easily.",1169683200,6,580,4.81
