Only22 minutes long, it is beautifully enacted and filmed and directed by Bob Talbot who did the cinematography for Free Willy. The deep free diving sequences were done by a champion in the field. Amazing how they packed such a perfectly written and photographed film into just 22 minutes. It's a little movie with a big movie attitude you can watch again and again!!!",1458604800,,424,4.666666666666667
