2989646,5,B000WQWPSC,Another great volume in the Avatar series.  Excellent stories and animation for the whole family.,1211846400,,97,5.466666666666667
2989647,5,B000WQWPSC,"We have really enjoyed this next segment of the series as a whole family. We pre-ordered this DVD, and it was delivered mid-day to our home on it's release date. Can you say 2 excited little kids? My son is already waiting for the next installment (as we do not have TV at our home), which comes out on July 29th. It was suitable for our children who are 8 and 6.
This DVD shows the 2nd part of the Black Day attack, and how Zuko attempts to become a part of the Avatar's group. It's very interesting to see how well the creators captured his awkward teenage angst of being accepted into a new group.  There is a cliff-hanger at the end, and of course we are all anxiously awaiting to see what happens next! :D Enjoy!",1210723200,,717,4.195652173913044
2989648,5,B000WQWPSC,"I couldn't wait to receive this product, and it came very expediently. I loved the shows, it was in great condition. Overall the experience of buying it was more than satisfactory. Thank you very much.",1203552000,,201,4.771428571428571
2989649,5,B000WQWPSC,"Since I have bought the complete book 1 and also complete book 2 which was absolutely great/fantastic. My family has seen the DVD's over and over again.
This time we bought the books as soon as they are released (have already book 3 Vol 1) and this book 3 Vol 2 is super.
We are really looking forward to Vol 3 that is going to be released in May.
I give all Avatar books (DVD) the highest score.

2989650,5,B000WQWPSC,This entire series is fantastic.  We never want to wait for the next one to come out.  I highly recomend it for kids and parents to watch together.,1202860800,,147,4.214285714285714
2989651,5,B000WQWPSC,"As It is used to be... This is an excellent serie, and this DVD is awesome with some of the very best chapters of the whole season. The only thing that I dislike is that it last chapter is the First part of the Invasion.. and in order to see the second part you have to wait until April or May when paramount releases the third volume. A pretty looong wait in order to see the second part of a single episode. A shame but putting aside this issue, I recommend you to see this series, which is one of the best in its category!",1202601600,,525,4.0095238095238095

2989653,5,B000WQWPSC,"One of the best Story Line based series to come out since Babylon 5!

We love good stories, regardless of the source and this story is one of the best!",1201996800,3,263,3.7636363636363637

8225224,5,B000WQWPSC,Purchased for our grandson.  We all watch together.  Very good martial arts.  Gets little one interested in physical activity and also about the effects of bulling.,1392336000,,164,5.230769230769231
8225225,5,B000WQWPSC,This is such a great series for people of all ages. It reinforces strong moral values while being a funny and satirical picture that both kids and adults love. I recommend buying all seasons because the episodes are addicting and will leave you wondering about the quality of your life. Avatar: The Last Airbender does not dissapoint.,1363132800,,334,4.87719298245614

8225227,5,B000WQWPSC,What a great series.  Too bad the live action kinda ruined it.  Avatar captivated the whole family when it was on TV and we just had to have the whole series on DVD.  Kids still love watching it.,1318032000,,195,4.078947368421052

8225230,5,B000WQWPSC,"As a continuation of my first review of the Avatar, my views are still the same, this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.  Even though I have some of them recoreded and have some dvds, I still have to watch it when it comes on TV. I love this movie and once again, I will continue to purchase the others until I have the whole collection..",1273536000,,354,4.057142857142857
