It is not a perfect movie - I thought the sound quality on the DVD was a little muted, the dialogue sometimes juvenile & the actress who plays Kracklight's wife annoying at the very least.

4713105,2,B005JR4T1K,"Whether you come to this flick because you admire architecture, dig Peter Greenaway, or love Rome (all of which I do), The Belly of an ARchitect will leave a bitter taste - and not just because the architect in question is suffering from a pain in the gut that makes him spew up nasty bile every now and then.

The script is a mess. What might have been an interesting conceit is tangled up in nonsense. All the Italians are corrupt (why they seem to conspire against the hapless American is never clear; if it's merely thievery, why are they so obvious?), the architect's wife is a bit dim, the architect an arrogant American without the sense to ask for an audit when his precious exhibition is being ripped off. But he must be some kind of magician: he can make photo copies even when placing the original right side up on the glass ...

Greenaway has managed to acquire amazing locations (the Victor Emaneul Memorial, Baths of Caracalla, Pantheon) and one wishes he had filled them with a compelling story; but pretty pictures don't make a movie, and this quasi-operatic tale doesn't wash. For all the talk of meat and blood, this one is as cold as cadaver.",1103068800,7,1161,4.55023923444976
4713106,5,B005JR4T1K,"Greenaway's ""Belly of An Architect"" is visually stunning and philosophically entertaining.  It is about an idealistic American architect whose life swiftly declines at the precise moment he attains his life's ambition.  It is about idealism and the worship of forms in contrast to the flux and chaos of life and death.  It is about the eternal slipping through the fingers of mortal man.  It is about reaching for the heights and developing stomach cancer.",1096243200,5,456,5.121621621621622
4713107,3,B005JR4T1K,"Peter Greenaway, presently a professor of Cinema Studies at EGS, has said,"" I really don't think that we have seen any cinema yet. I think that we have seen a 100 years of illustrated text.""

As a former film editor, he cuts in the camera. He loves long tracking shots, and he usually does them in one take. He will open his scenes in tableau, usually in a long shot, and then he allows it to stir to life. Each frame is a masterwork of color, light, and shadow, and a sumptuous feast of dazzling props.

His cinematographer, the great Sacha Vierny, helps Greenaway's cinematic look and style immensily. He has shot eleven of Greenaway's projects. Vierny composes each frame as if it were to be a Pulitzer prize-winning photograph. Two composers, Glenn Branca and Wim Mertens completed the score. This was the first film score for both men. It soared from Neo-classical to jazz; kind of like Nino Rota-lite.

After seeing a Greenaway film, I always feel rushed, like I have just run a foot race through the Louvre, as if ten times too much visual information has rippled over my retina, and that my visual cortex has only perceived a tiny portion of it; that repeated viewings are in order. I usually feel ignorant of the many classical, historical, and philosophic references. I feel that I need to read more, study more, think more, and that I wish I were smarter than I am. I feel extremely challenged and vastly over-stimulated.

Enter Brian Dennehy as the American architect Stourley Kracklite. He is an accomplished actor, and in this film he was able to grandstand, to perform a one-man show. His bulk and his energy were barely contained in the frame. He seemed to shake those pillars on all those great buildings as if they were bed railings. The movie opens in the heat of a sexual encounter as Kracklite copulates his way into Italy. A minor architect, hailing from Chicago, city of red meat and money. Wide of shoulder, amble of belly, bearded and bellicose, Kracklite swaggered about barking orders. He had come to Rome to set up and oversee an exhibition honoring his artistic hero, the 18th century architect, Etienne Louis Boullee'.

Chloe Webb played his young wife, Louisa. He was 54, and she was 24. They had been married for 7 years. She was not very good in this film. She badly needed direction, but Greenaway was not available for such trivial pursuits. Lambert Wilson, known these days as the French rogue Merovingnian in the MATRIX trilogy, played the handsome wealthy Roman architect, Caspasian Speckler. He was rich, arrogant, randy, and deeply dishonest. He would steal Kracklite's life and his wife. He would wrench the exhibition our of the American's hands, and he would witness the man's rapid deterioration with delight.

Kracklite was striken with stomach cramps immediately upon his arrival. This turned out to be the demon cancer, blossoming in his colon. He snarled, raged, and thrashed about, but to no avail. Cancer would be the victor. Or would it? He had some other ideas on that subject.

Greenaway set up the structure of the film to fit within the cycle of gestion, from conception on the rails to birth during the opening ceremony of the Boullee exhibition. Then he added death to the mix; death coiciding with birth, one making room for the other. This film was not a masterpiece, but it was masterfully constructed. Nor was it a vacuous exercise in esthetics as some critics have labeled it. It is a very good film, filled with plenty of grist and gusto.",1094774400,15,3501,4.748355263157895

Chloe Webb, most notable for playing Nancy in Sid and Nancy, is great as Louisa, his adulterous wife.  However, the best part of the film is Rome itself -- Greenaway portrays the city in postcard settings, with typical static shots of mesmerizing brilliance.  The buildings, such as the Victor Emmanuelle Building (The Wedding Cake), jump off the screen, begging you to visit.  The music, by genius Wim Mertens replacing Greenaway-staple Michael Nyman, is haunting yet drills into your subconcious.  Quite simply, everything about this film is brilliant, even the subtle irony at the end!  My only complaint: it isn't available (yet!) on DVD!

4713110,5,B005JR4T1K,"For those viewers who have found Greenaway's films excessive at times, and the metaphors attenuated to the point of losing their dramatic power, you will find ""The Belly of An Architect"" a superb, cinematic work of art. Like the ""Draughtsman's Contract"" but far more complex, the conflicts which are at first masked by social and artistic conventions unfold gradually between the layers of visual imagery, dialogue and music.
  Stourley Kracklite, played so perfectly by Brian Dennehy, is a man with a prodigious ego, lust for life and may seem initially to be less than a sympathetic protagonist. But surrounded by intrigue, opportunism and philistinism, he emerges as a hero.  He is an architect, an artist with a vision and a mission. From the beginning, his passion for his intellectual mentor,a fictional 18th century French architect, Etienne-Louis Boullee, and the scientist Sir Isaac Newton, provokes thinly veiled ridicule and skepticism from his Italian colleagues. Even
faced with a young and ruthless nemesis, Kracklite remains indomitable. His belly, the center of gravity, becomes a metaphor for his frailty, his humility and his humanity.
  What makes this film a work of art, in my opinion,is that you have all the components: A setting that complements the drama, Rome and its magnificent monuments as the backdrop, a strong dramatic situation with several critical issues at stake, including good and evil, characters who elude easy definition at first glance and vary distinctively, and themes that develop and resonate long after you have finished watching. As for the music,
I only wish that Greenaway had recorded a soundtrack.  Or if there is one, I haven't found it.
  ""The Belly of An Architect"" is the kind of film about art and life, the individual and society, vision and convention, love and betrayal that works so beautifully because its creator has remained focused, in my opinion, on telling a story, infusing it with a sense of both urgency and mystery, and so conveying an unmistakable emotional power as well.",1050624000,16,2044,5.1540785498489425

Louisa told her husband she was leaving him because she didn't want to ""drop"" the child too soon - because she was due in a month and his exhibition was in twelve days. Her character definitely did not have a way with words or common sense. I couldn't believe such horrible writing existed, but Ms. Webb's acting is even worse - I mean much, much worse than a first grade play.

Dennehy is an architect in Rome, who becomes ill, and even his own doctor is mean to him, showing him (he has the busts) how other artist's died ""foolish"" deaths (in his opinion).  In my opinion, they just died.  Maybe the doctor was trying to say that they lived their lives foolishly, but as I said, it's bad writing.

4713116,5,B005JR4T1K,"Many people accuse Greenaway of being too cerebral, too cold and dyseptic a filmmaker.  Those who think that should check this film out, one of his best films and buoyed by an extraordinary performance by Brian Dennehy.

The film concerns itself with Stourley Cracklite (played by Dennehy), an architect from Chicago who is putting on an exhibition dedicated to Etienne-Louis Boullee, a little known but visionary architect (Boulle was a real architect by the way).  One would generally not expect an actor like Dennehy to fit in perfectly with Greenaway's universe, but Dennehy manages to do it with aplomb.  Dennehy is also a stage actor (which is much respected for), and Greenaway's long take style really fits well with him, as theater actors are able to concentrate much more than strictly film actors, and are able to sustain emotions for longer periods of time.

Greenaway's mise en scene is fascinating throughout, especially the shots of the actual exhibition, which are really striking.  Dennehy's overpowering performance really makes you feel for him, and it gives it a more humanistic edge than much of Greenaway's work, which can be overly cerebral and cold at times.  The supporting players are generally good, except for Chloe Webb, who is just OK in her role as Cracklite's cheating wife.  Sacha Vierny's cinematography is magnificent througout, Greenaway's framing is impeccable as usual, and the film is arguably Greenaway's most moving film.  Despite a miscast Webb, the film is practically perfect.",1240704000,2,1520,5.19672131147541

Perhaps it is a mid-life crisis and a fear of death that simultaneously hits Chicago architect Stourley Kracklite (Brian Dennehy).  He has traveled to Rome to present an elaborate tribute to the French architect Louis Boullee.  Kracklite is fifty-four years old, uncertain that he has fulfilled the promise of his youth.  He is married to a woman (Chloe Webb) young enough to be his daughter.  So when he begins to develop stomach pains (perhaps due to a growing stomach tumor) while working in Rome and gets no satisfaction from doctors, he begins to believe his wife is poisoning him.  Furthermore it appears that she is having an affair with an Italian architect named Caspasian (Lambert Wilson) who also desires to take over Kracklite's Boullee project.  I think a lot of men in their fifties can identify with these sorts of threats to their well-being and perhaps be unable to tell the real from the unreal.

So the human belly is a big deal in this film.  At one point Kracklite prints out scores of photocopies of the belly of a Roman statue as if in scrutinizing mass copies of a flat belly he might somehow explain why he is in pain.  Or perhaps the flat belly symbolizes his lost youth and the insecure feeling he has about the affection and faithfulness of Louisa, his young wife.  Maybe it is even the case that the belly is a euphemistic symbol of something else that is no longer as vital as it once was.  When men in their fifties worry about such things they also worry about their ability not just to cut the mustard but the quality of their work.  In short, they worry about being superseded.  One cannot help but feel in this case that Kracklite's growing paranoia is in part responsible for his declining power.  Fear of something may give it strength.

As for the way cinematic auteur Peter Greenaway directs this film, I think his intent is to let the film reflect the subject matter in the sense that both are of artistic intent while accenting the fact that the movie is not--at least not primarily--a commercial enterprise. He shows the beauty of the architectural ruins of Rome.  He thinks in terms of tableaux in wide shots.  He picks a backdrop and sets the camera at some distance from the backdrop: Italian ruins, a spacious lobby, expansive steps in front of an impressive building.  And then he plays the scene.  Unlike most modern directors he mostly eschews close-ups.  I'd rather he didn't.  The effect is like being in a theater watching a play.  There is a certain appropriateness I suppose about this technique since it creates in the viewer a feeling of spying, which is exactly what Kracklite finds himself doing in one scene, looking through a keyhole to see what his wife and Capasian are doing; and Greenaway has us see too, at the same distance.

In another sense, there is a studied feel to this movie that suggests something a bit cold like marble which again is appropriate.  Yet Brian Dennehy, in an intense, engaging performance, makes us feel for him and his predicament.  We understand that he is realizing his mortality and we appreciate that his reaction is understandably confused and frightened.  As for his wife, she seems distant not only because of the camera work but perhaps because she is psychologically estranged from her husband and from what he is going through.",1232582400,2,3483,4.685855263157895

This is a movie which follows the desintigration of an american architect who comes to italy with his wife to open an exhibition on a lesser known yet highly respected architect from france... The movie opens almost immediately into a metaphoric level when the husband and wife talk about the carniverous nature of architecture on a train after making love (later we discover that they conceived a child).. and the metaphors and almost hallucinatory nature of the movie continues to the very end of the film.. Dennehy's character has several parallels throughout the film - he is compared to boulley (the architect he is honoring), Augustus, and other famous Roman emperors and architects like hadrian.. As the film progresses he develops a great pain in his stomach which is equated to being poisoned by figs.. This sets the main character on an obsessive quest to map out his own insides as if he is taking his knowledge of architecture to the human body..
The strange thought provoking nature of this film combined with the striking visuals make it all very satisfying - and at the same time a puzzle which is very hard to describe... It certainly has made me curious to check out more of greenaway's films...",1184284800,2,1373,4.773109243697479
4713120,4,B005JR4T1K,"Dreamlike, beautifully shot by great Sasha Vernie and equally disturbing (as all Greenaway's movies are), ""The Belly of an Architect"" (1987) tells the story of an American architect, Stourley Kracklite (Brian Dennehy) who came to Rome to work on the exhibition dedicated to the French architect of the 18th century, Etienne-Louis Boullee (1728 - 1799). Stourley brings with him his much younger wife Louisa with whom is passionately in love. Everything looks good for him - he's got a project of his dreams to work on, his wife is with him, and his Italian colleagues seem to be supportive and exited about the exhibit as much as he is. Soon, though, the things begin to change and look rather grim - Stourley's pregnant wife enters the affair with a younger man, the work does not move as quickly as it was planned and on the top of all, Stourley gets sick and perhaps more seriously than he thinks.

When I watch Peter Greenaway's films, I know they will be a feast for brain, eyes, and ears - his films consist of frames so perfectly composed that you want to capture every moment of them and exclaim like Goethe's Faust did, ""Stay a while! You are so lovely!"". The music in his films matches the visual beauty perfectly, and his outlook at the familiar world is always original and arresting even if it lacks warmth and sentimentality. ""The Belly of an Architect"" is all that: it is filled with symbolism and references to history, Art, and anatomy. It is also a social satire on difference between cultures but it is a compelling and moving story of one man's descending to chaos, hopelessness, despair, and eventually death. This is the first Greenaway's movie since ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover"" that made me feel compassion for its protagonist. I believe it is due to the incredible performance by Brian Dennehy - quite unusual name for a Greenaway's film but was he great as the architect of the title. Dennehy creates a character that is not likable as the film begins but heartbreaking and tragic by the end.

Many times I cannot explain why a film captured my attention and held it, while other times I can. Maybe part of this is the characters in the films, while other times the cinematography and musical score can do it? But ALWAYS, it is the narrative of a film that has that magical touch that hooks me right in. And this film did it for me. I cannot guarantee that you will like this film; I sure did, but I do recommend that you at least rent the film and give it a look. I found the films beautiful and at times haunting musical score captivating, and it was perfectly matched with this film and the breathtaking beauty of Rome. Moreover, it was the acting performance by Brian Dennehy which I found to be incredibly outstanding!

Directed by Peter Greenaway, I believe this film to be his masterpiece. I know of others who point to his other works; however, this is my favorite film of his. And I think this IS his masterpiece. I found myself riveted to the character portrayed by Brian Dennehy, and was amazed at the performance he gave. For me, Brian Dennehy gave the performance of his life. ""The Belly Of An Architect"" stars Stourley Kracklight (Brian Dennehy) as an American architect who has traveled to Rome with his wife Louisa (Chloe Webb), in order to give an exhibition of his favorite architect. And once again, the scenery of Rome is a delight, and the musical score is truly outstanding.

Stourley Kracklight is the films main protagonist whose journey to Rome will be one of heartache, and bellyache---literally! His primary goal as an architect, and the reason he has traveled to Rome is to elevate the status of an architect he believes has been sorely neglected. This man in question is that of the 18th-Century architect Etienne Louis Boulee. Kracklight is in Rome to give an exhibition on the works and influence of Boulee, which Kracklight has devoted more than ten years of his life studying. However, events in Kracklight's life will take a different turn as he begins to have stomach pains. But it is not just his stomach that is bothering him; Kracklight is also having a mental breakdown. And this will only worsen as his own terminal illness and obsession with death begins to consume him.

Although there are other narratives taking place in the film, it is Stourley Kracklight's life and illness that is of primary focus. Yes, there is friction in his marriage with his wifes infidelities, and his own jealousies of the younger men around him. Some warranted, others not. But this film is about much more than a failing marriage. It is about a man whose obsession with death has consumed him. Dennehy's performance as a man obsessed with life as much as death permeates every scene he is in. He even goes so far as to write postcards to the long ago deceased Boulee. This film explores deep into the soul of Kracklight and his mental break with all those around him, and the saddening toll this takes on his life as he attempts to cope with his terminal illness, while also showing how his illness is effecting his creative process too. This film has always fascinated me, however, it may not appeal to all audiences. But I highly recommend the film. It's a terrific drama, and deserves at least a rent if your not sure of purchasing the film.[Stars: 4.5]",1161561600,6,3429,4.618032786885246
4713122,5,B005JR4T1K,"""The belly of an architect"" is as much about archticture and the art of filmmaking as it is about the story of Stourley Kracklite, an American architect who visits Rome with his wife to create an exhibition of his little known hero Etinne Louis Boulle.

Rome, with its famous buildings and statues are as much a character as a background, its the city of meat and its breathing and throbbing. Director Peter Greenaway's approach (in collaboration with the French cinematographer Sacha Vierny) is that of an architect: flat and straight forward shots with a longing for tight composition and symmetry, big multi-structured panorama's and a keen eye for detail. Furthermore are all natural colors like blue and green filtered and only when the theme of death and decay come into the story, green is visible. All the rest are meat colors, brownish, redish, and the likes.

Just like Greenaway's obsessions for fimmaking and art in general, Stourley Kracklite's life is driven by obsession. And having an obsession means to hurt and to get hurt. Hurt because all other things in life come second, even family and personal health.

Dedicated to create a exhibition which will do justice to the works of the unknown Boulle, Kracklite neglects his wife and his health and slowly descends into paranoia. Is his wife cheating on him or not? Is his stomach really ill, is he being poisoned?  Is everybody involved with his quest for recognition Boulle (and in a way: for himself) really just after his money and does no one in fact really care?

Kracklite then turns to the only person he can trust: his long deceased hero Boulle to whom he starts to write postcards. Kracklites introduces himself, talks, asks questions, wonders, ponders and confesses, and finally, in a moment of truth, asks Boulle: ""Supose you came here to open the exhibition? That would show them all!""

It's almost impossible to believe but this realtionship between a lonely fan and his long time dead hero, all through one-way-postcard-messages becomes more and more moving.

The film self is, like all Greenaway films (""A zed and two noughts"", ""The cook, the thief, his wife & her lover""), drenched in juicy black humor and fortunately so, because Greenaway is a kind of snob, boasting at times too much with his intelligence and powerhouse knowledge of art, and without mockery, self mockery or humor to `keep things bearable', the movie would surely drown in a big swamp of selfindulgence.

But the real heart of this movie ticks within the American actor who plays Stourley Kracklite: the heavy set, bearded Brian Dennehy. His performance shines and sparkles, his body, his stomach, and his sneering, sardonic voice, everything fits the bill perfectly. He is funny and tragic at the same time, you feel sorry for him but at the same time you keep up with him, respect him. Like him.

If this would be Dennehy's sole leading role (in Hollywood cinema he is the typical `always suporting actor') then he could still be proud.",1151020800,8,2992,4.897233201581027

This movie can be a bit of a challenge. It's unconventional structure, attention to the art of composition and carefully considered scene-setting demand patience on behalf of the modern-viewer and will alienate most couch potato fodder.

But there is substance behind this style; a looping identity crisis with egos and aspirations folding in on themselves makes for layered reading in director Greenaway's sequential, almost ""fairy-tale-gone-wrong"" milieu.

Some won't give this film the credit as being a a work of art, but it is undeniably unique, and Dennehy's devotion to character is evident. Unfortunately it is not met by the supporting cast.

Peter Greenaway may be responsible for the single most reprehensible movie of all time, ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"" an obnoxious slime fest that I saw only because it starred Alan Howard, whom I had seen give the most riveting stage performance in my life. I didn't think I'd much care for it, but I was surprised; I despised it far more than I have ever hated any movie. Or book. Or magazine article. Or billboard, for that matter. It is in the rarefied world of hatred occupied by the songs of The Archies or 1910 Fruitgum Company. TCTTHWAHL was so foul and disgusting, seething with bilious muck, as opposed to just unbelievably stupid, like Caddyshack II, that I have waited many years before cautiously trying ""The Belly of an Architect.""

And why even bother? Well, I love Wim Mertens, and the soundtrack is among my favorite CDs. So, now that I could stream it at no cost, I could happily bail at any time.

An hour in I stopped for a break and thought, ""Hey, I'm enjoying this."" The narrative is not nearly as opaque as some of these reviews would imply, and the Brain Dennehy bulbous physique plays an important role in the story. But it is Dennehy's acting that carries the show, transcending the bizarre audio that sounds as if it were dubbed in long after the film was done, the tortuously inept acting of Chloe Webb, who would be right at home in a 6th grade play, the weirdly empty Roman landscape, devoid of humans, the ponderous Greek chorus delivery of the groups of men, and the telegraphed ending. OK, so what...we know what's going to happen in Hamlet, and yet it doesn't matter. Life sometimes has an inevitability that nevertheless is worth watching.

Dennehy is just wonderful, inhabiting this idiotically named role of Stourley Kracklite fully. A highly flawed man, who is still far better at recognizing reality than those around him, Kracklite is utterly believable as the man tormented by his deceitful body and his poor decisions. Incapable of addressing any of the torments in his life, he behaves badly, but again, quite believably.

And, the soundtrack, while poorly reproduced in my viewing, is stellar. So overall, far from perfect. But I bought in, and empathize with this outsized man and his many failings. And the majestic Roman architecture sure doesn't hurt.",1363737600,,2395,4.73621103117506
8475935,5,B005JR4T1K,"I just finished watching The Belly of an Architect last night and was blown away by everything about it. After reading some people's reviews here about it being a film that is badly written and has no point to it, allow me to say a few words.

Many of you have heard of the name Chuck Palahniuk, and while I blanch to use him as a reference, you all understand the name. If you ever have read a book of his you understand that it is written in what is known in the literary world as ""minimalism."" This style of creating also extends into music (like the composer of this particular film, Wim Mertens), and in a wonderful turn, Peter Greenaway the film director is also a minimalist. What this means is that there is as much to what is not being said as to what is being said. Wonderfully, in film, and in Peter Greenaway's case, he gives you an amalgamation of hints. One of his trademarks is to use color to illustrate a theme. One of the chief ideas of this theme is the idea that Augustus was poisoned by his wife by means of figs; when this is brought up a giant bowl of bright green figs is introduced on screen, and as the film continues to play, any time we are being led into a hazardous or uncertain situation with the wife, green lighting or prominently colored green props are used. The color of Augustus' bile upon dying is said to be yellow, and so as the themes of death build, the color yellow begins to saturate the atmosphere.

The writing of minimalism is not to tell a story, but to illustrate ideas in a confined space. What is it that a person wants the audience to think about. It's not something you can take in with one viewing. You have to go back and listen closely to everything that is said, to understand why it is being said, and by whom. It's puzzle box for the brain that is based on the idea of questioning and examining everything that is seen and heard.

The plot of the film is intricate (with themes ranging from Jesus, to roman statues and fountains, to Issac Newton and gravity, to the human belly), but displayed very simply. Kracklite, an American architect has come to Rome with his wife to work on an exhibition of Boulle, which he has been planning for 10 years. His wife is Italian by heritage, and begins to disappear into the city and become part of the lifestyle and inhabitants, while Kracklite, an outsider, is constantly shut out and demeaned. Watch for the themes about Christ and the subtle comparisons, which are beautifully executed by being shown, never said.

Soon his wife is pregnant, and this draws on the attentions of a man who is trying to ruin Kracklite's chances at his exhibition, in hopes of taking over it for himself, and using the money to fund his own political agendas.

Kracklite begins to be sick in his stomach, and is told about the history of Augustus, and his poisoning by figs, starting an obsession with his stomach. He longs to be someone who is not trapped in his physical body, but never lets this seep over into wishing he was not his own self, being very proud of the intelligence he has cultivated.

The film culminates in various levels, with brilliant punctuations. Every performance is beautifully nuanced, from the wife's devil-may-care disassociation from the people around her (it seems that becoming pregnant, the only person she connects with is her unborn child, an extension of herself). Kracklite's empirical fall, and the Italians slipping in and providing an ambiance of longing for sexual and artistic climax.

The Belly of an Architect is simply phenomenal. The last lines of Kracklite's astounded me; as everything has been taken away, and he knows every last detail of what his future holds, he is detained and upon release asked to give his name, nationality, address, family ties, and career. ""Is that all?"" Kracklite asks, amused and amazed. And it is. That is how you sum up a person. And in Kracklite's face we can see that it is enough. What more should one need?

If you like story-telling movies and don't like bouts of contemplative silence or monologues (or will ask questions like ""why is he writing to dead people on postcards?"" without trying to answer those questions for yourself), this would be one to avoid. However, if you love art, this is one to watch for the production values alone. I highly recommend this movie to people who love high literature (like Burroughs or Woolf) and have an interest in metaphysics. The movie isn't so much about architecture, as much as it is about the caverns that we dwell in. The structures that swallow us down into their guts, from the grandest of cathedrals, to the coffins that hold us in our graves.",1330646400,4,4661,4.573652694610779
