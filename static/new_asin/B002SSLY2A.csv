The instruction Mr. Jhung gives is very clear and he has a cute sense of humor that comes out from time to time. The ballerina, Ms. Boylston, demonstrates the excercises beautifully and is very inspirational.  I have been practicing the floor excercises religiously since I purchased the video about a month ago and I can feel the difference in my body. The barre excercises are very strengthening and I love the way Mr. Jhung recommends practicing them infront of a mirror to check for proper placement.  I liked the DVD so much I have already purchased 2 more, one for pointe work and one on pirouettes.  I feel this information would be valuable to dancers and teachers alike. Highly recommended!",1383868800,15,822,4.6875
3982268,5,B002SSLY2A,This is the best stretch video ever!! Using this video will get me back in shape in no time. Not even painful.,1363996800,3,110,4.045454545454546
3982269,5,B002SSLY2A,"I needed work with my turnout in ballet. I didn't know anything about Finis Jhung, but decided to try the video anyway.  I love it! He has a lot of good and useful techniques. I showed the video to my teacher, who has a friend who studied with Mr Jhung in NY (she speaks very highly of him)and she loves it as well. The only problem now is that everyone wants to borrow my video and I haven't seen it in a month!! I will definitley advise them to buy their own, as soon as I get it back, it is staying with me!!!!",1323561600,17,513,3.9326923076923075
3982270,5,B002SSLY2A,"Wow, what a workout.  No matter what your ability, you can challenge it with this DVD.  None of the stretches or exercises are totally unique or anything, but they're the good ones that build strength and flexibility and stability all at once.  Handily presented in a format that counts for you, you'll never skimp your flexibility work again.

I trust Finis Jhung above all other teachers when it comes to doing things right the first time.  Learning to keep your weight and alignment as you move and turn out...such a difficult process!  So rarely dwelt on in ordinary classes!

Finis Jhung is definitely the cure for all those bad habits you learned by looking at your peers at the barre.  No dancer should neglect this DVD.  It's like a concentrated barre session, minus the majority of technique practice and focusing solely on those movements that build strong turnout and extension.  Ouch, but in a good way.",1299110400,51,915,4.8076923076923075
8379591,5,B002SSLY2A,"There are some truly wonderful exercises here.  I especially like the floor stretches.  My nine-year-old dancer struggles to maintain proper body alignment when attempting standing developpes, and there were several floor exercises included on this disc that have helped immensely by allowing her to isolate and stretch the appropriate muscles while maintaining proper alignment.  Great instruction.  Thank you!",1508803200,,411,6.0344827586206895
8379592,5,B002SSLY2A,Wonderful video.  Clear explanations of what is being done and why.  Now I just have to work these movements into my weekly routines.  Finis Jhung is a terrific teacher and Isabella Boylston is a superb model for these exercises.,1506988800,,229,4.82051282051282
8379593,5,B002SSLY2A,A game changer!,1486339200,,15,4.333333333333333
8379594,5,B002SSLY2A,"Finis Jhung is a master at explaining the art of movement, and the stretches in this DVD are divine. If you are looking to develop your ballet technique, this video is a must.",1481760000,,175,4.333333333333333
8379595,5,B002SSLY2A,"This is my second DVD from Finis Jhung.  The first DVD was Ballet Barre for the Adult Absolute Beginner, and I have had such good results from it that my regular ballet teacher started to demand much more from me in class (including ""more turn-out""). I read that turn-out cannot be forced (only gently coaxed), so I turned to Finis's collection of DVDs for guidance.

RESULTS: First of all, I don't think you can expect quick results in turn-out and extension for an adult ballet beginner who has not stretched (especially not in those areas!) in years. Even now, after about a month of practice with this DVD, I cannot fully reach my leg over my head in Developpe or do a split, the way that Isabella Boylston and Finis himself do it.  Having said that, there is far less tightness and more space in my joints and in my body overall, and I have noticed other small, but significant, changes.

Two specific examples from my daily living:
- I have an old injury in my right ankle, due to which I have not been able to sit cross-legged in meditation for longer than 15 min, because of pain; after starting this program, I can sit for 30 min without a problem: there is much less pressure on the ankle, because my hips are that much more open.
- I am a doctoral student, and I have to stay at my desk long hours, writing; so I pretty much have resigned myself to a low grade chronic back pain: this pain disappeared after about 1.5 week since I started daily stretching!

As far as the regular ballet classes go, I have not dazzled my teacher with a spectacular extension or turn-out or ceiling high grand battement yet, but when I do plie, rond re jambe or battement or developpe in class now, I have a much better form, because I know exactly what muscles I need to be working.

Thus, even though I cannot yet claim a true ballerina's stretch, turn-out and extension, I see these remarkable improvements as genuine signs that this DVD is very effective in achieving what it claims to offer.

As before, I remain deeply grateful for the clarity, thoroughness, and pure joy of Finis Jhung's instruction.",1459036800,14,2100,4.496062992125984
8379596,4,B002SSLY2A,It's useful but maybe not for a stiff person like me . . .  It makes you sad to try each chapter cause you look so different from the ballerina on screen.,1448323200,,154,3.8125
8379597,5,B002SSLY2A,"He is the best at what he does. Clear explanations, excellent tips and excellent demonstrations.",1425254400,,96,5.466666666666667

8379599,5,B002SSLY2A,I love this DVD especially when I miss my classes. Finis is so cleared with his instructions. You learn so much and you can see the difference in your performance. It is a great source for dancers.,1403481600,2,197,4.351351351351352
8379600,5,B002SSLY2A,"I never heard of Finnis Jhung before-I'm glad I read about him in these reviews-I love the way the excercises were explained and that they were slow enough to see how they are done, I even was informed about the correct way to pull up from the plie/ spelling probably not right. You do it with the inner thigh muscles, not from the lower part of the legs. Any how I am learning beginners level, I'm 82yrs old---some people think I'm nuts and just trying to be '''young''-----For their information I do it to strenghthen my knee muscles and make my legs and body strong-plus I like it and don't care what anyone thinks about it because of my age. I love this teacher's methods and I'm going to get beginners Barre training next. I bought a ballet barre and I love doig this.",1393459200,48,773,4.375
