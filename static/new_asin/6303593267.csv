685543,4,6303593267,"Macario is a man who is very poor and who finds it very difficult to feed himself and his family.  One day he tells his wife that he wants a turkey to himself and she grants him his wish.  He goes into the forest to eat it, but he is greeted by men (three in total)each time he tries to eat his turkey.  Finally, he shares with the third gentleman, and he gives him magical water.  Macario has strict rules on how to use this water which he has to obey.  This water makes Macario rich, but the catholics priests thing that he is a witch.  He has to prove to them that he isn't a witch, but there is a problem when he tries to show them.
I think that it is very interesting and is more than a story about a poor family.  This is a story about the problems the people can have when they are poor and the things that they will do to get money.  Also, I think the movie teaches a lesson not to be greedy.  At first, I thought that a movie about a turkey would be boring, but it is very realistic about the problems of being poor.  It gives the audience a sight at the social problems when poor and the social problems when rich.  Money doesn't give people happiness or fix their problems.",1039046400,,1184,4.03862660944206
685544,3,6303593267,"This movie, Macaro, is about a man from Mexico, Macaro, and his family. This family represents many of the families in Mexico and is marked with hunger and poverty. Macaro only wants a turkey for himself and doesn't want to share it with anyone. His wife takes a turkey from her ""boss"" and gives it to him. After recieving it, he goes into the forest with the turkey and starts to eat it, but there are three interuptions. Each interuption represents something different: The rich/devil, God, and death/hunger. Eventually, Macario gave part of the turkey to the third person that represented death. In exchange, the person that represented death gave him a flask of special water that cures people who are sick.
  When Macaro went back to his house, he put the special water water in little bottles. He uses these bottles of water to cure people, but he also uses the water to make a profit to help his family. At the same time, he becomes a very respected person in the neighborhood. Macaro believes that he can cure everyone, but this is not the case. He learns that there is a special order to life. Ultimately, the wealth and his thoughts led to the death of Macaro. He ran, but he couldn't run from his destiny because there is a greater force.
  I believe that this movie represents the wants and desires that many of the people have and that money is not important. Also, it represents the rapid wealth and he should make a lot even though he didn't have a lot in the past.
  This movie is a balance between death and life. At the end of the movie, it was implied that Macaro was dead before the story even started. All of the movie was a dream.
  Many of the movies that i saw have a lot of sexual elements. I like this movie because it doesn't have any of these elements. The movie revolves around the feelings of a person that doesn't have money and their situation. If you like movies with magic and are about life in general this movie is for you.",1038787200,2,1959,4.4222222222222225
685545,5,6303593267,"When I first saw this film in fragments, and sensed the immense struggle, tragedy and horror within it, I knew I'd have to see it in its entirety in time. Its story is compelling, but so is its visual atmosphere, which is like an American studio film of the 30s --rich, bigger than life, choicely B&W-- made 20-some years out of time. Macario comes from the end of an era in Mexican film making that has come to be known as The Golden Age. But it isn't at all ""campy"", whatever that is. The issues Macario and his family face here are very un-Hollywood, truly life and death: Starvation, human cruelty and injustice, and the spectre of grave are never far from mind for anyone in this scenario.
The story is simple, the anti-hero's dilemma poignant and real. Once you see it, you'll never forget certain moments: Macario's children downing their meager rations, while he can only sit, watching in hunger and distress as he wonders where all this can end; poor Macario licking his lips and panting like a dog as he watches the baker baste the mayor's feastday turkeys; and Macario begging death for a favor, as he will more than once before the film ends.
In some parts of the U.S. (like L.A.) Macario is shown at Christmas time just as A Christmas Carol or It's A Wonderful Life are in most of the rest of the country. This almost makes me wish Macario had a wider audience. --But maybe I don't. Maybe this film seems a little more precious to those of us who love it because it hasn't been oversold and overexposed through the years.
I urge you to make it ""your"" film too. Be warned, though: it is thought-provoking, and unrelievedly sad. You may want the crying towel as you watch this. ""It's a Wonderful Life"", it ain't!",1026086400,11,1723,4.490445859872612

This film is so  simple, yet profound, and it satisfies because it's so well written. I love  the scene with Death in the candlelit cave, it's magical.

685817,5,6303593267,"Macario is one of my mother's all time favorite movies. It is indeed a splendid movie with an excellent cast. Ignacio Lopez Tarso gives a heartfelt and sincere performance as Macario a hard-working campesino who goes for days without meals in order for his children to eat off his plate, his one dream is to eat a whole turkey by himself without having to share with anyone, his wife seeing how he suffers manages to steal a turkey for him one day and when he goes off to the woods to eat he is accosted by The Devil, God and Death who want a piece of his banquet: Macario refuses to share with The Devil knowing his offer of riches is all smokes and mirrors as well as with God because having suffered hunger for a long time, he knows all God wants is to test him. Death on the other hand he shares half the turkey with seeing as he views the spectre as being as hungry as he is and also in Macario's clever mind since humans can't fight death, he figures if Death wants him he'll stave him off for a few minutes longer while he enjoys the turkey. In exchange for sharing his meal and for making him laugh, Death grants Macario magical water which gives the man the ability to heal but only those that are not yet at Death's door ie if Death is standing by their feet, but if it's their time to go and Death is perched by their head nothing can be done . . . Death warns him to use the gift he bestowed on Macario with caution. After one of Macario's children suffers an accident and Macario is able to heal him with Death's life giving water word spreads like wildfire around the village and soon many others flock to have Macario save their gravely ill loved ones causing Macario and his family notoriety and great success, as well as the local doctor to have a sharp decrease of patients to which the envious man then accuses Macario of practicing withcraft to the Inquisition. The story turns darker from there but all in all this is a riveting tale that holds up pretty well over time and left me wanting to know what happened afterwards to the lives of the characters. The DVD seems to be out of print in the US, but fortunately I was able to get a great copy at a reasonable price imported from Latin America, no special features but in this case the movie is more than enough.",1343260800,,2285,4.267281105990784
685818,5,6303593267,Great movie around the topic of the Day of the Dead and good illustration of the times of the Holy Inquisition. A must have. Cultural awareness and a good insight on the life in Mexico under Spanish Rule and Veceroys.,1315353600,,217,4.45
685819,5,6303593267,"A must see!  The film does a wonderful job in explaining the Mexican's point of view of death, especially as it relates to the celebration of El Dia de los Muertos.  In addition, if highlights their deeply rooted faith in God. Very well done!",1303689600,,242,4.4772727272727275
685820,5,6303593267,"This wonderful film  with Ignacio L&oacute;pez Tarso, mirrors, to some extent, the short story by
Bruno Traven.  The movie depicts the moral and human struggle of un campesino during the
period of time of the Spanish Viceroyalty in Mexico.  Macario as a poor woodcutter with the
semblance of a dream: to be able to eat an entire turkey and feel himself satiated without
the need to share with anyone.  Essentially, what is here is the knowledge of sacrifice
and death as the essence of life, of his life.
  Although the film does not grasp the nuances of the written short story, or the annotated
work, expressions of dignity and moral struggle are evident.
My suggestion is to read the work, Macario, by B.Traven before viewing the film.",1290988800,,738,4.771653543307087

685822,5,6303593267,"I first saw Macario in the 1970s - it was at a movie showing on the Univ. of Colorado campus in Boulder. Still I remember the movie with great fondness. It is full of symbology, some humor, some pathos. It's an excellent movie whether you are viewing it in the 1970s or 2010.",1265155200,,275,4.2075471698113205
685823,4,6303593267,"In this 1960 black-and-white film, a poor Mexican woodcutter named Macario - tired of being hungry every day - swears to his wife that he won't eat again until he can eat an entire turkey by himself. His wife obtains a turkey through exceptional effort, Macario travels to the wilderness to eat it, and is then met by a devil, an angel, and death himself. The rest of the film hinges on the results of those encounters. The plot of the movie is entirely captivating. The portrayals of extreme inequality, with indications of beliefs about how those translate into the afterlife, are intriguing, as well as the image of death and how his power is governed. After watching, my wife and I discussed at length the implications of Macario's choices, the foil between him and his wife, and the uses of power.

This film was Mexican film to be nominated for the Academy Award of Best Film in a Foreign Language (it lost to Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring). Next year, on the Day of the Dead (which is when the film takes place), I hope to hold a viewing of Macario.

The DVD is basic but fine. The audiotrack is in the original Spanish, and it has subtitles in English and Spanish. It also has a page with mini bios of the major actors in the film.",1164585600,12,1244,4.451754385964913
685824,5,6303593267,"Macario es una pelcula de Mexico.  Se hizo en 1957, pero las acciones de la pelcula son durante la Inquisicin, y tambin es durante el Da de los Muertos.  Es una pelcula de Roberto Gavaldn y los actores pincipales son Ignacio Lpez Tarso como Macario, y Pina Pellicer como su esposa.

 Macario es un trabajador del campo; l tala los rboles y lleva la lea a la ciudad todos los das por dinero.  l tiene 5 hijos y una esposa, pero parece que l no puede trabajar bastante para abastecer bastante comida para su familia.  Los hijos siempre se pelean con uno a otro para comida y Macario se entristece y se enoja que es un marido y proveedor malo.  Por estos problemas, l se nega a comer hasta que puede comer un pavo en total, solo.  Su esposa se preocupa as, ella roba un pavo, lo prepara, y lo da a Macario.

 Macario se va de casa, a la bosque.  All, se encuentra a tres ""personas"" que quieren comer tambin. El resto de la pelcula implica la interaccin que Macario tuvo con estas tres `personas'. Durante la pelcula, Macario experimenta muchas cosas en su vida: con la pobreza, la riqueza, las acusaciones de la brujera, toda la gente le gusta a Macario y luego toda lo odia.  Hay realismo mgico en la pelcula tamben, con el agua mgico, la aparicin de las tres `personas', y con la ultima escena de la pelcula.

This story may well considered a syncretism of several transited roads, but the script enriches notably adding elements of the Mexican folklore. In this sense the film is brilliant because reminding Northrop Frye in Fearful Symmetry, ""There are two kind of Cosmology: the designed to understand the world by itself, and those that intends to transform it in the form of the human desire""...The First one is speculative, or intellectual narcissism; but the second is in last instance the supreme goal of the Art, and this film bets for the second choice.

685866,4,6303593267,"Regarding the film, this is an old Mexican classic released in 1960, a little bit after the Golden era of Mexican cinema, from director Roberto Gavald?n, who also did Flor de Mayo starring American Jack Palance (who performed in Spanish!).  For an American viewer, I would say this film is sort of a Mexican It's A Wonderful Life, only you would watch it every Day of the Dead instead of Christmas.  Its a good film, with touches of surrealism and good old fashion morality (a la Capra), but definitely lacks the shine of earlier Epoca Dorada films.  It shows a slight taint of fifties cornyism as well as the influence of the new medium of television.  But by all means I don't want to sour you on this film.  The cinematography is done by the famed Gabriel Figueroa, and he gets an occasional chance to shine.  If you haven't seen it, you should definitely check it out, especially if you have an interest in M?xico or D?a de los Muertos.
Regarding the DVD, I can only say WOW!  This is part of the new apparently Televisa-backed Vive M?xico collection, and the production is first rate.  The image quality is top notch, it has marvelous trailers for other films in the collection including Ahi Est? El Detalle (comedian Cantiflas' most revered film) and El Rapto (an Emilio Fernandez flic with Jorge Negrete and Maria Feliz), and it also has English and Spanish subtitles, which have been lacking on other recent DVDs.  I see that a number of rare classics like Maria Candelaria, Dona Barbara, Bugambilia, La Perla, Salon Mexico, & Los Olvidados have already been released south of the border in this collection, let's hope somebody gets smart and starts selling those up here sooner rather than later.  Otherwise I'll have to take a trip down to Tijuana just to buy some DVDs!",1086480000,30,1780,4.676282051282051

Yo recomiendo esta pelcula a todos personas que quieren ver una pelcula con otros perspectivos sobre vida y los problemas de siempre quieren ms.",1039046400,3,1538,4.597785977859779

 Macario es sobre una familia pobre que vive en el campo.  Macario, el padre, corta madera y su esposa lava y plancha ropa para ganar dinero.  No tiene bastante dinero para dar comida a sus hijos.  Un da, Macario lo recibe agua mgico como una regla.  l comenza a curar los enfermos de la gente del pueblo con su agua mgico.  Muy pronto, la familia se hace rica y vive en el pueblo.  La Inquisicin cree que Macario es un brujo as l se escapa.
 En mi opinion, Macario es una pelicula muy bueno y yo lo recomendara a otros.  Es una cuento de escogidos que todo el mundo tiene que hacer, escogidos sobre supervivencia y dinero y nuestras familias.  As, es facl para relacionarse con Macario y su familia.  Hay agua mgico y personajes que se representan el Diablo, Dios, y la muerte.  Los elementos mgicos se usado para ilustra condiciones sociales.  El Diablo se representa los ricos, mientras la muerte se representa el hambre o otros pobres.  El agua mgico, tal vez, representa la fortuna que todo de nosotros encuentra en nuestro vidas.",1039046400,2,1188,4.649038461538462

One day he tells his wife that he wants a turkey to himself, and she grants him his wish.  He goes into the forest to eat it, but he is greeted by men (three in all) each time he tries to eat his turkey.  Finally, he shares with the third gentleman, and he gives Macario magic water.  Macario has strict rules on how to use this water which he has to obey.  This water makes Macario rich, but the catholic priests think that he is a witch.  He has to prove to them that he isn't, but a problems occurs when he tries to show them.
I think that it is very interesting and is more than a story about a poor man.  This is a story about the problems people can have when they are poor, and the things that they will do to get money.  Also, I think the movie teaches a lesson not to be greedy.  At first, I thoguht that a movie about a turkey would be boring, but it is very realistic about the problems of being poor.  It gives the audience a sight at the social problems when poor and the social problems when rich.  Money doesn't give people happiness or fix their problems.",1039046400,2,1170,4.043478260869565
