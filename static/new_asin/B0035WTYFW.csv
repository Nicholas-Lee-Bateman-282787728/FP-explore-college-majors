8389267,1,B0035WTYFW,has almost nothing to do with Booker T Washington!!!!!  I paid for nothing more than a VERY brief history of the park put aside in his name and a whole lot of gardening tips!!!!!!!!! DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS SO CALLED DOCUMENTERY ON BOOKER T WASHINGTON,1476662400,,250,4.555555555555555
8389268,1,B0035WTYFW,"Although I appreciate the attempt that was put into this, especially as so few have been attempted on this subject so far, and the project was clearly not without effort, I have to say that this was a dismal and piecemeal representation of the excellent character and life of Booker T. Washington.  I started out hopeful that this was something worth watching but within moments, after the shaky camera work and looping soundtrack, I was skeptical that it would amount to much.  Once the camera turned on to a television screen to record an already recorded segment of someone elses work, I gave up entirely.  Boo.  I cannot believe I spent any money on this.",1391299200,,659,4.7043478260869565
