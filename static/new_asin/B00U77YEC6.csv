7029459,5,B00U77YEC6,"This series has the feel of an American Civil War movie, except that this movie is about a war between European nations.
I do recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed ``Gettysburg``, ``Of Gods and Generals`` , ``Shenandoah`and Horse Soldiers.
Probably by today the most expansive movie Denmark has produced, with German cooperation. It cast`s a lot of Stars from the Danish series
``Forbrydelsen`: (The Killing) , `Borgen`` and from the German series `Generation War`( Unsere Muetter, unsere Vaeter).
It also tells the story to what extent unleashed and unchecked patriotism can lead to. And often led by politicians that have very little idea`s of what horrors a war can produce. Sadly this one was inspired by an charismatic female Opera Diva ( Sidse Babett Knudsen) to a romantic ``dreamer nerd`` prime minister . The Diva playing the ultimate Dominatrix part.
In short this series delivers some very good sub stories, supplying the viewer with a comprehensive portrait of Europe 19th century life.
Perhaps with some ``modernised` elements of ``Gone with the Wind`` or the lesser known German version ``Lenz oder die Freiheit / 1848 Badischer Aufstand`:.",1437177600,5,1160,5.208556149732621
7029460,5,B00U77YEC6,"For decades I was always saying that for me the Russian film of 'War and Peace' made in the 60s and 6 hours long was probably the greatest film ever made. I'd put 'Les Enfants Du Paradis' made in 1944-5 and 4 hours long close to that. Then there was Polanski's 'Macbeth' and 'Tess',  Roeg's 'Eureka' - and never to be forgotten, Peter Watkins' extraordinary film about Edvard Munch.
Some 20 years ago I had to start thinking where I should place Germany's 'Heimat' although it was made for TV. And then came along the BBC's last 'Mayor of Casterbridge' (a masterpiece of TV film drama if ever there was one) and the BBC's last 'Madame Bovary' both of which have every right to be regarded as films and compared with the best of them.
You can see where I'm coming from. But now I have to seriously consider whether this Danish film made for TV is as good or more important than any of them. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how it beds down with time

WHY IS THIS FILM SO IMPORTANT? Well this was the first war on European soil to show the nature of modern warfare and demonstrate the German military might which allowed them to go on to supplant Austria and become the dominant power in Europe when they defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71. All this under Bismark, one of the characters in this drama, who achieved the rapid industrialization and unification of Germany as a result of which the Germans acquired the confident military mindset which eventually led them to believe they could take on and defeat Britain, France and Russia together in the First World War. One wonders how anyone in this country knowing what German artillery could do in 1864 could possibly believe they would be home by Christmas in 1914, unless in defeat.
Even the ingredients which went into the making of World War Two can be seen in a certain  resemblance of Monrad and Hitler. Both of them nationalistic in the extreme, apparently inspired orators, though vain and delusional, and willing to provoke war and sacrifice the lives of thousands with the unshakable belief that God, in the case of the former, and destiny in the case of the latter, were on their side.
This is certainly the best anti-war film I've ever seen. But there is also one particular episode concerning the officer Dinesen, apparently based on real events, that shows something else altogether and ends up being undeniably thrilling while at the same time not losing a sense of the true nature of violence and the sudden reality of death.

Please note that one of the listings Amazon have placed these reviews on is for the Spanish edition of the DVD and  dubbed into Spanish.",1435968000,10,2653,4.612288135593221

8704562,5,B00U77YEC6,"A really excellent mini-series, beautifully filmed. The acting was superb. The storyline, and soap opera, of the novel it was taken from reminds one of Sholokhov's novels (the Soviet writer). It is the story of an obscure (unless you are a Dane or a north German), little war between the Danes and Prussians, foolishly fought over a relatively small border area. A needless war of political egos. The Danes lost 10,000. As a vet I can attest to the fact that it truly captures the emotions of battle, and the prime ingredients of combat: noise and chaos. It is very realistic. One of the most haunting, unforgettable scenes I've ever experienced in a film, a sort of perfect terror, takes place in a forest with Danish infantry attempting to escape death, exhausted but running blindly away from a lost battle. Behind them, in hot pursuit, but never actually seen, are a large number of mounted Prussian Hussars, blowing a hundred fox-hunting horns (a common practice of the times), solely to create terror in the pursued. Absolutely chilling. A masterpiece of film making. (Be aware! region 2 dvd.)",1515456000,2,1099,4.882352941176471

8704566,5,B00U77YEC6,"An excellent TV miniseries produced in Denmark. It centers around an obscure (to Americans) war... the Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864. Arranged around the plot concerning 2 brothers as they grew up during this period and their mutual interest in the same woman and how they eventually end up in the army fighting for Denmark, are portrayals of real historical figures such as Bismark, Molke, etc. This story has interesting twists and turns and does not end they way you might think (no happy Hollywood ending). Very well acted and interestingly and richly plotted.",1467504000,,565,5.086021505376344
8704567,5,B00U77YEC6,"1864 is an eight-part TV mini-series, filmed in Denmark and is the most expensive television series ever made in the country. Many of the actors and crew are veterans of contemporary Danish noir series such as Borgen and The Killing, but 1864 stands in contrast to them as a sweeping, epic war story spanning generations and taking in the lives of soldiers, politicians and civilians during the Second Schleswig War of 1864. This war, obscure today outside of Denmark, marked a vital moment in the transformation of Germany from a loosely-allied collection of small states into a powerful empire, setting it on a course that would lead, six years later, to the Franco-Prussian War and eventually the First World War itself.

The so-called Schleswig-Holstein Question was a bewildering political/ethnic controversy of the time which reduced even ardent European politicians (well-versed in the most tedious minutiae of bizarre border disputes) to bemusement. Very wisely, 1864 avoids getting too entangled in this mess. Instead, it presents the story of the war in the impact it has on the population of a small Danish village. The local baron is incompetent and his son Didrich was a coward during the 1852 war, avoiding conflict and traumatised by the brushes with death he did experience. Returning home, Didrich wastes no time in taking his frustration and bullying tendencies out on the local population. Among those is a war veteran, Thger Larsen. When he dies, his two sons, Peter and Laust, are forced to grow up and work hard to help their family survive.

Peter and Laust soon befriend Inge, the beautiful daughter of the baron's new estate manager. Their innocent childhood friendship is complicated when, as adults, Laust and Inge fall in love and Didrich's violent temper gets more out of control. When the war starts, the brothers join the army and find themselves under Didrich's command, whilst Inge discovers that she is pregnant with Laust's child. However, the brothers are soon separated as the Prussian and Austrian armies sweep north, smashing everything in their path. The Danish forces fall back on Dybbl Hill, where the most decisive battle of the war will be fought against overwhelming odds.

The structure of the series is interesting. First of all, there is a framing device set in the present day where unemployed delinquent Claudia gets a job caring for Severin, an old man who lives in the same manor house as Didrich and his father, now fallen into disrepair. An initially hostile relationship is overcome when Claudia finds Inge's journal and begins reading it to Severin. The series then uses the first three episodes to establish life in the Danish village and set up the key characters (Peter, Laust, Didrich, Inge and Sofia, the mute daughter of a travelling band of gypsies) as well as establishing the political situation through a series of subplots involving Monrad (the equivalent of a Prime Minister) and German historical figures such as General Moltke and Bismarck. The series does a good job of setting the scene for the war, establishing Denmark's nationalism and parallelling Monrad's own personal life (he loses confidence in his skills of oration and has to be coaxed back to competence by an actress) with that of Denmark's growing confidence and then disastrous overconfidence.

These opening three episodes are a bit weird. The first episode, which has child actors playing Laust, Peter and Inge, is the weakest and the actress playing the young Inge is painfully wooden. Monrad's crisis of confidence and regaining it by having an actress walk on him is also strange. The idea here is to overcome the cliches of costume drama by showing the full range of human behaviour, including some eccentricities, and this is sometimes effective (Didrich is portrayed with more nuance than his one-note villain character summary may suggest). It's also sometimes just random, such as during a brief scene where a nobleman attempts copulation with a cow for no apparent reason. There's some brilliantly human moments in these opening episodes and they do set up the rest of the story well, but they're quite uneven.

Things take a massive upturn in the fourth episode. When the war finally erupts and the brothers reach the front, the series unexpectedly turns into Band of Brothers: Denmark. A host of supporting characters appear as other soldiers in both Peter and Laust's platoons, all very well written and acted. There's some very deft characterisation, so that when characters with only a few minutes of screen-time are killed the audience cannot help but feel sympathy. There's also Wilhem Dinesen, Peter's commanding office and a one-man killing machine whose stoic heroism stands in contrast to the cowardice and blustering of Didrich. The series also touches base with some recurring characters in the Prussian ranks, such as the Marx-quoting soldier who is dismayed at having to wage war on fellow working men.

The fourth through seventh episodes are all-out war stories, focusing on planning, sieges and visceral scenes of bloody combat that match anything ever done by HBO. Some of the cinematography and scenery in these sequences are breathtaking, as are the visual effects (with some very effective mergings of CGI and practical stunts). However, the series always brings things down to the human level and humanises everyone involved, even the generals (many of whom are horrified when they witness what modern artillery and rifles can do on the battlefield and start looking for a peaceful way out). The final episode catches everyone up on what's happened, explains the relevance of the framing story and generally wraps things up well, while still leaving room for tragedy and regrets.

1864 is certainly an unconventional historical series, but it's also a gripping, memorable one. The direction is uniformly excellent and the writing is effective, although sometimes the symbolism can be heavy-handed. The series sometimes meshes together spiritual and symbolic scenes (such as the prescient Sergeant Johan Larsen drawing ice out of the heart of a dying comrade) with much more literal scenes of combat in a way that is really confusing. The framing story also veers a little into cliche, especially the depiction of Claudia as a teenage rebel because she's mildly nihilistic and has piercings. These bumps in the road are overcome thanks to uniformly brilliant acting and strong, measured pacing that knows when to throw in a horrific battle scene and when to focus on the character drama. A special word must be reserved for the music, which is particularly excellent.

As a work of history it's a bit more of a mixed bag. The writer-director has taken a view rather different to the traditional Danish one, trying to show the conflict as a pointless one brought about by overconfident politicians in the face of reason. The German characters are depicted fairly sympathetically throughout (apart from the hard-headed and ruthless Bismarck), as are the generals on both sides. Monrad, a more complicated historical character, is reduced to a religious fanatic and buffoon in the series. This is more of a shame as the opening episode suggests he will be a more important and complex protagonist, but as the emphasis switches to the battlefield and he appears less, he becomes more of a one-note figure.

They're also fairly minor. 1864 (****) is at times off-beat, weird and clumsy, and at others is funny, heart-warming and painfully human. But during its four-episode depiction of the actual war itself, it easily matches anything produced by bigger American or British studios and becomes unmissable.",1438041600,9,7671,5.1206070287539935
