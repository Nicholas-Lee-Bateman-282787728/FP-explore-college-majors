This is a 2007 Sony box set containing three separate discs packaged in their own individual slimline DVD cases.

I was very disappointed in this
set, because the only film presented in Widescreen (2.35:1) format is 'The Seventh Sign'. The other two features, 'Mortal Thoughts' and 'The Juror' are presented in ""Full Screen"" format (1.33:1). It's almost inconceivable that in 2007, Sony is still foisting old, dated, full-screen transfers on customers. Plus, at $20, this is not a bargain-priced set.

Because the Amazon product description does not indicate the viewing format or other important details, here's a summary of what's in the box;
