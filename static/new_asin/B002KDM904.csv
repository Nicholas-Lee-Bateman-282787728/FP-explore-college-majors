This great DVD will show you their exceptional talents in drum playing. The costumes are beautiful. The variety of drums and other percussion instruments is unique.
If you like drum performance of the Japanese Kodo and Yamato drummers, this Jigu group will give you another excellent auditory and visual performance of the Chinese drum style.
Highly recommended as the stereo sound recording is excellent for a live performance The video does have occasional moments of overexposure of the drummers but is overall quite good.",1391904000,,729,4.934959349593496
