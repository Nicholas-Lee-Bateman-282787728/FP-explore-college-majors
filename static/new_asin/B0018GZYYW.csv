Every year it seems to be growing more and more with soccer specific stadiums being built, and more and more teams being added. It shows Donovan's great run with San Jose and eventually with the Galaxy. If you really love watching the MLS, you have to buy this DVD to see how it all started. With Real Salt Lake's stunning victory over the western champs, LA Galaxy last year, I can't wait to see what's going to happen in the 2010 season. Pick this up if you get a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1267142400,,619,4.254237288135593
8269748,5,B0018GZYYW,"I have to say that this movie was exactly what I needed to truly enjoy MLS soccer. The way the championship games are presented makes them feel like they were true classics. The games are presented with energetic music as well as commentary and the shots of the crowd really made me feel like US soccer is legit. Basically, this movie makes me want the 2010 season to start tomorrow to see who will be written next in the history books. Simply epic. Go MLS!",1266624000,,457,4.3882352941176475
8269749,4,B0018GZYYW,"This DVD is a cinematic look at every MLS Cup final, not including the 2008 season. It's well-produced with some great cinematography and slow-motion shots. If we're being honest, not every MLS Cup was a classic, but if your club has been lucky enough to win its last match you'll appreciate the way it's documented here. There isn't much to fault besides the dry presentation, plus it's pretty light on extra features. The additional commentary was rather boring; basically selected players explaining ""what winning the Cup meant to me"", as well as some spraying of champagne in the changing rooms. It would have been nice to see a reel of all of the goals, or maybe a full version of the first MLS Cup, or something interesting. As it stands, this DVD does the job and not much more.",1232841600,2,785,4.654676258992806
