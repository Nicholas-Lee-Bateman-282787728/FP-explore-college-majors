8467951,5,B005E7SFEC,"This is a good old time western like the ones I used to watch in the late 1950s. The story is good too, typical western, with bandit chases, stagecoach robbery attempts, gentlemen behavior to the ladies, and with a conclusion, not just a dropped ending like lots of current movies.",1466121600,,281,4.64
8467952,4,B005E7SFEC,"I just love these old westerns . Some are good , some are better . And some can be so silly at times . A common flaw is when their guns never run out of bullets . Also when a stagecoach gets robbed , the bad guys start shooting too soon , giving ample warning , they have six-guns with 20 or more bullets , the shotgun-rider has a rifle , but cannot hit anything , & always gets hit . Why would any fool take on such a job ? In real life a rifleman could knock of many stupid outlaws .",1463875200,,485,3.7184466019417477

8467955,5,B005E7SFEC,"B-Westerns of the 1930-40s were a breed of cinema all to it's own. This one is indeed a minor classic of the genre. It's from Monogram, so it's REALLY cheap, but that in itself often adds to the charm and love of this type of Saturday afternoon nostalgia. We get has been silent cowboy stars Ken Maynard, Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele, well beyond their prime, riding the poverty row circuit for one last fling at stardom, though Steele, the youngest of the three, still looks fit and can throw a good punch!
The plot here doesn't matter. The Trail Blazers are called in to stop the bad guys. Steele joins the gang to work from within but is discovered. Very implausible situations abound. The good guys win and the Trail Blazers ride off for their next adventure. Nothing wrong with that at all.
What's great here is the chemistry between Ken and Hoot, two tough galoots in the 1920s, having a great time at the end of their careers. The dialog is often witty and quite funny. You can feel the onscreen charisma here, though Ken was a bugger as always to deal with off camera and soon left the series.
This is a Super Great transfer for a B-Western, showing just how good these films can really look when they were first released. We're not talking SHANE here, this is an entirely different world, even though it's situated in the American West. We're talking B-Western, low to no budget. And it always amazes me what an entertaining package can be put together on mere peanuts. Take them for what they are, mass entertainment, not art.
...and throw in a coveted supporting cast including George Chesebro, Charlie King and Glenn Strange and you're in B-Western heaven. Buy and enjoy.",1411776000,,1681,4.6066666666666665
8467956,5,B005E7SFEC,Ken Maynard (and his wonderful horse Tarzan) is one of the great and unsung film stars of the era. He and Hoot Gibson make a wonderful pair.,1400457600,,140,4.222222222222222
8467957,5,B005E7SFEC,"Maynard, Gibson and Steele are back at making the west safe! A good watch! Hoot Gibson never fails to entertain with his bright ideas that often go wrong. Bob Steele adds a touch of reality with his romancing a young lady. While Ken Maynard is the one that always attends to the business at hand keeping his partners heading in the right direction. After set backs and shootouts law and order wins in the end. If you have ever been to Death Valley you will appreciate the comments about how hot it is! This was the first thing that caught my attention. I am keeping this one in my watch list as I can watch it again later. It is amazing that on a second viewing I will pick up on something I missed the first time. So pop your popcorn, open a bottle of root beer and relax and enjoy a great movie!",1394668800,2,797,4.181818181818182
