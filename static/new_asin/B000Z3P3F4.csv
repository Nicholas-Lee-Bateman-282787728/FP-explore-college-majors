8234697,4,B000Z3P3F4,"This is a nicely done print of a 1950s TV show about the 82nd, mostly post-WWII. It's not very long. It's a little like a recruiting film. It does stress to the recruits that parachute jumping is very safe if you follow the instructions. My friend who was at Normandy laughed out loud at that one. They leave out the part about when  somebody might be shooting at you while you do it.",1370131200,,384,4.260273972602739
