8510923,5,B0076FCUFU,Great video,1491436800,,11,5.0
8510924,5,B0076FCUFU,"Watch it, learn it, practice it, and you will improve your shooting immensely. I happen to like the format Kyle Lamb teaches in, it works for me.",1475971200,,145,4.407407407407407
8510925,5,B0076FCUFU,I've heard of Viking Tactics and now want  to go train in person. This is a very good DVD with a lot of great information and drills you can take out to the range on your own. Highly recommended,1441238400,,194,3.9743589743589745
8510926,5,B0076FCUFU,More drills to train for the fight. Goes beyond and basic course for pistol defense.,1430006400,,84,4.666666666666667
8510927,4,B0076FCUFU,"The information is great, but the two discs from Viking cost more and did not have as much total info as a set of four from magpul.
 The companies agree on several point but disagree on some things, and it's always nice to know when there are options, and know what the companies find to be a matter of personal choice, versus things they agree are absolute best methods, so i'm glad I have both viewpoints to consider.",1408579200,2,419,4.371794871794871
8510928,5,B0076FCUFU,Kyle Lamb's training DVDs are superb.  You really don't need to say anything else.  I have both tapes as well as the AR15 tapes.  Great stuff.,1392854400,,142,4.384615384615385
8510929,4,B0076FCUFU,"Plenty of good tips in here and it is filmed very well- lots of camera angles used.
Kyle isn't a desk-jockey theory guy.
I think his DVDs are great additions to a training library.

No 5 stars because of a couple things:
The flying bullet into a VTAC target and lightning graphics and macho metal music between chapters/drills takes up a lot of time.
These seques/buffers between scenes occur between every darn drill and last way too long.
A simple panel saying ""Drill 3-- the Bill Drill"" for 5 seconds would be fine.  Throw in some lighting if you really need to but 5 seconds is tops for a buffer.
Second peeve is that both my DVDs skip and get hung up in several places.  Probably not run off by a high quality DVD place?

Great content, great instruction and certainly recommended.",1387497600,4,786,4.514084507042254
8510930,4,B0076FCUFU,"Very good pistol drills to practice at the range. As for the law enforcement officers it would great to update their skills but it is not have tactical instructions for street fights. You could choose the other DVD ""street fighter""",1384992000,,231,4.8
