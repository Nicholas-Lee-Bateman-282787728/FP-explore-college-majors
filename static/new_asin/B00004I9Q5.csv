But still entertaining, same way as Revenge of the Ninja, not so much sophistication but still worth watching!",1435363200,,270,3.8214285714285716

7920428,3,B00004I9Q5,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and wanted to see it again now. I bought the DVD which says its an all region compatible disc. The conversion to DVD though is very bad as everything is so dark and the view looks like it's been copied ten times from a VHS tape. Other than that it's the same movie you may remember.,1314748800,2,328,3.984848484848485
