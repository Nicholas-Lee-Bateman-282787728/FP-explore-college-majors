6681207,4,B00NVSFBVQ,"The movie starts out slow and then it feels like the producer speeds the movie up dramatically. I think the movie was rushed and the plot was not fully developed until the end of the movie. The way the movie starts out I would rate it 3 stars but close to the end of the movie you can really start to see that the movie is a good movie and I really wish the director would have taken her time and really produced the plot fully in the movie. The end of the movie gets really good but you will have to hang in there through the first part. Overall, I will say I like the positivity of the end of the movie and the fact the producer was trying to tell a story and get some dark secrets to the light. So I'm going to focus more on what the producer was trying to do rather than what she didn't do. This is a good story. It starts out slow and the plot is rushed at times so the audience is quickly moved through the suspense of the movie rather quick. But I will say you will enjoy the movie and find parts just genius. But if you are looking for the movie to be good from start to finish you'll really have to give the movie a chance. I give the movie four stars because it is hard to find movies that actually tell a story, give the audience a lesson and entertain at the same time. So I appreciate the thought that was put into making the movie into an inspiring story for many women and men who might have gone through the same things in the story. May the movie be a positive and inspiring testimony to them that 2nd chances do happen and it is a blessing from God.",1486598400,,1567,3.9936305732484074

6681217,3,B00NVSFBVQ,"It was ok, just wish more upbuilding movies would be made with no violence, no drugs. While these are things that are occurring in the world, why does it have to be given a platform?
Just clean entertainment would be such a welcoming change of pace. I think everyone is already aware of the bad conditions, I for one would like to see healthy entertainment with no profanity, no drug use/selling, no violence. It's slim pickings.....:(
Just saying.....",1485129600,2,452,4.8076923076923075

8680527,4,B00NVSFBVQ,this was a great movie and it explains a lot.
