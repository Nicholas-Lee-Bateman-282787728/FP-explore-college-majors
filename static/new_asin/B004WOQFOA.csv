Mrs. Marple, pull up your rocker and see how this female power trio get's the job done!

4488482,5,B004WOQFOA,"This is a brand new six part TV series which covers the workings of the Manchester Metropolitan Police in the UK, specifically the Major Incident Team. The main idea behind the series is the interaction between the two overworked female DCs, Rachel Bailey and Janet Scott who are quite different people but who complement each other to great effect. Although they are great friends, fairly regular disagreements are a feature of their relationship. Janet is a very steady, older character in her forties, whilst Rachel is younger and more impetuous and comes up with the inspirational ideas. We learn about the personal lives of the pair of them which adds interest and impacts on their work. This contrasts the series with the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-UK-Series-1-4-Region-2/dp/B004VMHUP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: UK - Series 1-4 [Region 2</a>], where it is all strictly professional and we find out little about the individuals.

In the first episode Rachel is seriously upset about being dumped by her married lover, Nick who continues to feature as the series progresses in an increasingly prominent role. Rachel's detection skills were obviously lacking as they had been going out for two years and it had escaped her notice that he was married with kids which seems a tad unlikely. Their first case seems to somewhat mirror Rachel's personal life as it involves a guy cheating on his wife whose girlfriend is found hanged. The various murders investigated by the pair have interesting twists. One involves a possible murder of her spouse by wife and boyfriend, just lacking a body whilst another concerns a serial killer whose activities go back as far as 40 years!

All this makes for highly entertaining viewing. It is well acted by the two leads played by Lesley Sharp and Suranne Jones. However, their feisty boss, DI Gill Murray, played by Amelia Bullmore, also has a very key role in the series. The many fans of Scott and Bailey will be pleased to know that an additional series is already planned. You almost groan inwardly when yet another cop series hits the screen, but this one is sufficiently distinctive to make it well worth viewing. If you missed the TV series the DVD includes a short 'Behind the Scenes' bonus.",1331596800,12,2318,5.1786666666666665
4488483,5,B004WOQFOA,"I just completed watching this series and am very impressed, both with the stories and the acting. The action centers around two detective constables, Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey. They work for the MIT, Major Incident Team and handle and array of vicious murders while dealing with their somewhat tumultuous personal lives. This series is more about police procedure than action and focuses on the characters rather than plot. Their boss, DCI Gill Murray is quite a character and is very well played by Amellia Bullmore. This is one of the better police dramas I have seen in quite awhile and I watch a lot of British police stories. This series is somewhat similar to a show that came out several years ago called ""Murder Investigation Team"" that also focused on two women detectives. Unfortunately it only lasted for two seasons. Let's hope this series lasts much longer. Highly recommended.",1329091200,28,895,4.973333333333334
4488514,4,B004WOQFOA,"I have to admit that at first, I didn't want to watch this show.  I find British ""girl cop"" dramas puerile and ridiculous as a rule.  But this one is different.  I can't say that the police officers don't deal with ""women's issues"" but somehow this show isn't the usual ""single mother struggling"" or ""working mom with annoying teenager"" variety.  At first, it feels like every major character in the show is female.  But then you realise how every major character in all the other cop shows are male.  It's definitely not a touchy-feelly feminist lovefest.  The only real complaint I have is that the episodes are so short that the mystery of the week seems rushed to conclusion.  But the stories are good and the emotional drama doesn't overshadow the police procedural as on other shows.
However the final season is incredibly disappointing.  It's only three episodes (as opposed to 6-8) and it appears that they just wrote them to wrap up the character storylines when the show was cancelled.  Without spoilers:  one character goes down a road that she has been adamantly against the entire series and it was such a role reversal from even an episode previous that I won't be watching this again and I hope they don't revive it.  For a character I genuinely enjoyed, I never want to hear anything about her again.  I feel betrayed.  For a show full of women, created and written by a woman, it unfortunately demonstrates a belief that all women must follow the same destiny in the end and it's off-pissing.",1506297600,,1509,4.688212927756654

4488516,5,B004WOQFOA,"Sally Wainwright is the greatest writer of roles for women.  American film roles for women always put physical attractiveness over skill as an actor.  The lead characters in Scott & Bailey are authentic and dynamic.  All of Sally's projects are a  perfect combination of brilliant writing + brilliant acting.  All film makers should learn from her.  If she is writing a show, I'm watching it.",1504569600,,392,4.953846153846154

4488544,4,B004WOQFOA,"Well written and enjoyed the mystery.  I thought the emphasis on their dysfunctional personal lives was a bit over the top, but it seems that most of the newer tv shows are less about the plot and more about exploiting their myriad of personal problems--all revolving around their love lives.

4488551,2,B004WOQFOA,"I am a fan of Brit detective series, but this one not so much. I wanted to find a new series -but I got a neurotic, self-centered, obsessed detective with mental health issues to the detriment of the criminal case. The other detective has home problems. I didn't even bother to learn their names because by episode 3 I was done. When a detective series focuses more on the personal lives of the detectives instead of the crime, I have a problem because I want my who-done-it and not the petty details of their personal lives, especially since I can't even give a damn about these unlikable characters involved with unlikable, weak men.",1483660800,,635,4.628318584070796

I particularly like the character of Gill - complex and just a little bit dark - but all of the cast are superb. I'm bereft, having finished all four series.

4488695,5,B004WOQFOA,"Let this review be for all three seasons of this show. This is an exceptional series. The stories are well crafted, Each episode has a crime that is solved, but each season has also an underlying story that continues through all the episodes, finally to be resolved at the end of the season. The temptation to watch them all at once to find out how everything comes out is strong. This series is different in that the females are the strong personalities, and the males are the disfunctional ones. Its a great twist and extremely refreshing. Both Scott and Bailey are credible characters. This is very well acted as well. One of the best detective drama series yet.",1448150400,,665,4.6440677966101696
4488696,5,B004WOQFOA,"Smart, funny, intense, and truly interesting storylines. Characters I adore. So much better than most American crime/detective shows. Real entertainment.",1448064000,,153,6.7
4488697,5,B004WOQFOA,"This is a superb British series, written by the estimable Sally Wainwright.  It is set in Manchester and environsthe original homes of the co-stars.  Suranne Jones plays Rachel Bailey; Lesley Sharp plays Janet Scott.  Janet is in her mid-late 40s, Rachel in her early 30s.  Each is a Detective Constable, Janet by choice (because of her family responsibilities), Rachel because of her youth.  They solve nasty crimes under the leadership of their boss Gill (pron. Jill) Murray, played by Amelia Bullmore.  In some ways Gill is the key to the story, because she is unfailingly shrewd, salty and sane.  While Rachel and Janet get into scrapes, Gill extricates them.  She also, by her very presence and skill, makes this a convincing chick/cop/show.  In other words, the quite capable men in the unit follow her leadership without question.  In effect, the show makes a point without making a point.

The episodes must be seen in order, because there are both personal story subplots and a continuing case subplot.  Rachel (especially) and Janet have a seemingly unending set of problems in their private lives that create personal drama; you have to see these events unfold, in order, to be able to follow the larger plot arcs.  In the first series there is also what becomes a serial killer subplot which continues across the episodes, each of which contains an A story/case.

The acting is flawless, the scripts exquisite.  Each episode is approximately 45 minutes in length, which makes for excellent pacing.  The gritty settings play a nice role in the stories and there is just enough humor to balance out the gore and violence.  This is one of my favorite series (and if you like series 1 you have multiple years of shows to enjoy later).

One final pointsorry, Amazon.com, but Amazon.co.uk sells the first series for around $11.  My advice: purchase an all-regions player so that you can both shop for best price and obtain shows from Britain that are unavailable in the U.S.  Amazon.com sells them for a little more or a little less than $100.  I recommend those made by Pioneer.  With the new all-regions players there is no need to code the disks when you insert them.  You just sit back and let the player read the disk and play it.  If you purchase a lot of dvds and if you like British television (some of the British shows are also marketed by the Dutch), the all-regions player pays for itself in a very short time.  Enjoy.",1447977600,,2436,4.756563245823389

It is important to watch the entire season and do so in order to best appreciate the development of the drama and the individuals.  I am struck by the general portrayal of policemen and women in both British and American TV.  Are they all really so consumed by their work that they have failed private lives? The three very strong female characters in this series do their jobs exceptionally well, but make poor choices in their private lives. It does add to their development, but I sometimes wish there would be a police character with a normal life. Perhaps Sgt. Saturday in Endeavor.",1440979200,2,748,4.702290076335878

Being a fan of ""Vera"" I thought that the IMDB's description of the show as ""Two female detectives, one motherly, the other emotionally immature, have varying levels of success applying their eccentric outlooks on life to their police cases and private lives."" sounded quirky enough to try and I was glad I did.  Alternately yelling at the screen for Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) to get her life together and Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) to focus on her family there were six very well written episodes with some compelling stories.  I especially enjoyed Amelia Bullmore, who played their boss (SCI Murray), and found Rupert Graves' character (a barrister who nearly destroyed Bailey's career) completely despicable. I find it interesting how often English actors appear in different series.  Kevin Doyle, who played Mr. Molesley on Downton Abbey shows up in a very different role here.  Overall, the stories were good, the acting excellent and I really enjoyed the entire series.  In fact, I just ordered the next two seasons. I recommend it.",1429747200,2,1108,5.027322404371585

The story lines are less complicated in the novels upon which this TV series is based, but, to be fair I admit I've read only two of the books.  So far I prefer the TV version.  The premise is intriguing:  a major crime unit (a ""syndicate"" as the Brits say) whose cleverest detectives, including the boss, are female.  Janet, Rachel and Gill are stars at work while their private relationships are problematic.  In my opinion, this is not as good (or believable) as Shetland, and not nearly as good as the French crime drama, Spiral (Engrenage, with English subtitles).",1426550400,,695,4.75

4488775,5,B004WOQFOA,"This riveting series is anything but ""chocolate box,"" which may be why it isn't better known in the U.S. The series takes place in the gritty environs of Manchester, in northern England, with a distinctive culture and accent. The writers, actors, directors, and entire team have created one of the best and under-rated British suspense series out there. Lesley Sharp, magnificent in other BBC series, brings her considerable talent to playing Detective Constable Janet Scott. She is well-matched by the extremely nuanced Suranne Jones as the much less stable Detective Constable Rachel Bailey. They are members of the Metropolitan Police Major Incidents Team (MIT) , headed by another wonderfully strong actor and writer, Amelia Bullmore, as Detective Chief Inspector Gill Murray. Writer Sally Wainwright and team do a bang-up job. There is clever exploration of the tensions of maintaining professional and private relationships, and the struggle for women bosses and their subordinates to find that challenging balance of authority and respect.

The writing and conviction of the fine team of actors, with great producers, directors, and creative filming, make this one of the best, most suspenseful crime/drama series out there. There is difficult, dark subject matter, but there is nothing trite about how it is handled. Some of the best elements regard issues about maintaining teamwork and friendship in an intensely stressful work environment.",1425600000,2,1450,5.473214285714286

A Mother who is so wrapped up in work and her partners problems that she ignores her children, takes her bedraggled and weary husband for granted . . . or better yet is it about a wishy-washy over 30 something woman who can't let go of a dead relationship??? I mean really? I watched because there was nothing else on and unfortunately, I spent money on 2 epi's before I finally couldn't take it anymore. I try to give every series the benefit of the doubt. This could be a great series if they focused on female officers solving crimes and catching the bad guys instead of the dysfunction that was displayed.",1425600000,3,768,4.453900709219858

Also, I have decided that Sally Wainwright is my new girlfriend even though she killed ****.

Fans of Inspector Lewis will find an equally compelling series in Scott & Bailey, with several strong and exceedingly capable female leads.
The only caveat is that the series doesn't shy away from the grittier side of criminal behavior- the plots are very 'heavy' indeed.

4488807,5,B004WOQFOA,"Actually I'm shocked by the level of sophistication in the plot, and the acting. Sorry, not knocking American t.v. which I love, but this is a step up.  As I have watched two seasons, now, it drew me in and has my full attention.

 The characters, not just of the two detective woman, but of the rest, are very intensely developed and as complex as a real person. They pull off being ""real"" people in a way I've rarely experienced on t.v., are believable, intelligent, highly flawed like most intelligent folks, that are devoted to their job types of characters.
They are at once brilliant & screwed up in their way, and don't hide either one of those qualities well.  They are everyday heroes doing their best and they also screw up, and not just in little unrealistic ways, but in ways that alter the rest of their lives and choices.  Just like with real people.

Their families come in tow with their jobs and make an impact on their lives as they struggle with the demands of such an intense job, and try to balance the needs of their families, & the way their upbringings or past experiences has contributed to who they are, as well.

The most striking part of this series for me is the dialog between the detectives and the perpetrators or suspects; it is a slice of life I feel I would never experience otherwise, if not for this show.

I find myself admiring the whole team, and concerned for the characters, who are tough but also show amazing compassion and morality at times.

  From the previous reviews, I would not have had a clue to the depth and intelligence in this show, or the talent of the producers, or any element of it, really.  I'm surprised in a good way.

 If I were you I""d feel good about buying the whole season and making the commitment.  It's t.v. time and money well spent, although we all have different tastes and moods.  I don't watch it when I want something light that I don't need to keep my eye on to get it.  In that case I may watch Chopped or Arrow, or the Good Wife.

I also don't get the feeling that they sell out with sex scenes or gory exploitive things, that they are are using violence to sell the show, like so many shows where you don't really want or need that.  I don't need to have soft porn, or watch someone having sex to get the plot, I don't need to be shocked out of my deadness with a severed head itself to feel the atrocity, although when the show needs to be graphic to be real, it is.  The don't always protect you, be forewarned, but with scars feeling like you participated in something sick. More than that, it's moving, that they don't use the violence to sell the show, at least not yet as far as I have seen. JMHO.
It's there, as it is in life, but not sensationalized.",1416700800,12,2739,4.322896281800391

THEY threw a really cool(and annoying) hat on blonde hair extensioned bello, poured her into cutting edge gear and ruined Helen mirrens character! U with me? I cAnt stand the insult of female police procedurals TV over here where THEY hike up stars metal boobs, spend hours on curling hair extensions, and throw them at us... No character, no substance, no grit,no interest... P.U. !!
These characters r excellent... A peek inside their imperfect lives and wrenching story lines. I'm into season 2 and am hoping it does not become a girls club event.... One of the protagonists is so much thinner in season 2... Please don't go Hollywood on me girls!

The ""trailer"" at the beginning of this DVD highlights shows like ""DCI Banks"" - which I reviewed last week  - and others in BBC crime series. I should point out that many of these shows - including this one - did not air in the UK on the BBC but, rather, on the commercial ITV network. Hence each episode is just under 45 minutes in length. Also, unlike US TV series, British crime drama series are much shorter. Season one of ""Scott and Bailey"" is just six episodes.

If you've read any of my other reviews here on Amazon, you know that I am not a fan of ""spoilers"" so I won't go into much detail - though, honestly, I always feel that long reviews of mystery series give away too much info. Mysteries are called that because the less you know the better.  But I'll let you make that judgment call. One review I scanned tells you things  that occur even as late as the third episode.

The two women in the title are both DCs (Deputy Constrable) and work in partnership solving crimes. The crimes in this series are okay but there is more focus on the two women's personal lives than other such shows. This makes them more human - in my opinion - as you know where their judgment  is coming from.

The DVD contains one bonus. It is the now-requisite ""Behind The Scenes""  featurette - and runs nine minutes. It's interesting but it is the actual episodes that should bring you to the DVD.  The package has a label that reads ""As Seen on Your Local PBS Station"". That's because some stations aired it - and possibly in an edited version - for violence and language - but it was not aired by national PBS.

I'm looking to follow these women on their cases (and in their personal lives) in the next two seasons as they are released in the US. A fourth season was commissioned and it was to start production this Spring (2014).
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The acting by all of them is wonderful and Suranne Jones work would make Meryl Streep envious. I love that this a team of three women, with a woman heading up the force. One of my favorite episodes ended with all three women having needy men in their lives. Usually it is the women who are needy. Not in this series. It's complex and complicated story telling beautifully done. I can't recommend this series enough. Just the very best. American TV should take some lessons from this show. Maybe American TV would grow up.",1402272000,15,636,4.491379310344827

4488861,4,B004WOQFOA,"This review is from: Scott & Bailey: Season 1 (DVD)

I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. She drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

Recommended. prisrob 01-22-14",1390348800,15,1308,4.698689956331878
4488862,5,B004WOQFOA,Love this series which I only recently discovered on my PBS channel!  Although I couldn't play it on my DVD player--I didn't know British DVDs were different--my husband managed to put it on his computer and I watched it from there.,1386547200,2,232,4.658536585365853
4488863,5,B004WOQFOA,A good series that covers both the crimes and the detective's personal lives.  The female guv in this series is an exceptional actress as are the actresses who play Scott and Bailey.  I'll take a British drama over an American any day. Glad to see Amazon making these available to their U.S. customers.  Thx.,1383091200,26,308,4.666666666666667
4488864,4,B004WOQFOA,"I bought this item from BBC America at a better price.
I bought it because I liked the series and was tired of the censorship sponsored by the religiously insane.",1382918400,12,162,4.433333333333334
4488865,5,B004WOQFOA,Enjoyed this tv show a lot. Hoping to see more of these interesting ladies and good story lines. I hope there will be more seasons to come.,1380931200,14,139,4.185185185185185
4488866,2,B004WOQFOA,"If you are looking for a mystery or detective story, forget about this series.  It's more about the love lives of the protagonists than about crime.  Bailey, a complete flake, shared a flat with a man for two years and never discovered that he had a wife and family.  She then proceeds to stalk him.  Some Detective.  Scott had an affair with a colleague and regrets ending it.  The Boss is divorced and battling with the ex.
In fact, detecting seems to occupy little of the show. For example, in one of the episodes, a murder is committed, the perp is spotted on CCTV and a neighborhood inquiry comes up with the man, who is arrested and confesses --- five minutes, max.  The rest of the episode is nothing but Soap Opera.
  It seems that current detective stories are moving more and more into the personal lives and drama (or melodrama in this case) of the protagonists and farther away from the original ideas of Christie or Sayers.  If office intrigue, love affairs, trysts and hysteria is to your taste, you'll love this series.  I, for one, prefer Lewis, Midsomer or Foyle. You know, Detectives.",1380326400,12,1102,4.6
4488867,5,B004WOQFOA,"This is a brand new six part TV series which covers the workings of the Manchester Metropolitan Police in the UK, specifically the Major Incident Team. The main idea behind the series is the interaction between the two overworked female DCs, Rachel Bailey and Janet Scott who are quite different people but who complement each other to great effect. Although they are great friends, fairly regular disagreements are a feature of their relationship. Janet is a very steady, older character in her forties, whilst Rachel is younger and more impetuous and comes up with the inspirational ideas. We learn about the personal lives of the pair of them which adds interest and impacts on their work. This contrasts the series with the likes of Law & Order, where it is all strictly professional and we find out little about the individuals.

In the first episode Rachel is seriously upset about being dumped by her married lover, Nick who continues to feature as the series progresses in an increasingly prominent role. Rachel's detection skills were obviously lacking as they had been going out for two years and it had escaped her notice that he was married with kids which seems a tad unlikely. Their first case seems to somewhat mirror Rachel's personal life as it involves a guy cheating on his wife whose girlfriend is found hanged. The various murders investigated by the pair have interesting twists. One involves a possible murder of her spouse by wife and boyfriend, just lacking a body whilst another concerns a serial killer whose activities go back as far as 40 years!

All this makes for highly entertaining viewing. It is well acted by the two leads played by Lesley Sharp and Suranne Jones. However, their feisty boss, DI Gill Murray, played by Amelia Bullmore, also has a very key role in the series. The many fans of Scott and Bailey will be pleased to know that there are two more series to look forward to. You almost groan inwardly when yet another cop series hits the screen, but this one is sufficiently distinctive to make it well worth viewing.",1379980800,72,2062,4.805633802816901

4488871,5,B004WOQFOA,"i became a Lesley Sharp fan via two UK series, AFTERLIFE and BOB AND ROSE. she was outstanding in both.  she is pictured as the blonde on the cover pic shown here. she does another great job here as the older and married woman partner to her brunette, pictured also, counterpart.  the two of them make an effective team.  Sharp has one of the best speaking voices in acting.  you could listen to her read the phone book.  thus, it is a marvel to see that voice used on bereaved families and suspects in interrogation as well as with potential witnesses.  her partner is a loose cannon.  she has incredible instincts for solving cases, the best in the whole department, but she is personally a complete mess. nowhere is this more evident than the all encompassing fallout from her affair with a married barrister, played by everyone's favorite villain in UK tv, rupert graves.  he is magnificent, as usual, as a complete cad, liar and all around scoundrel.

this series is still going strong on uk tv so it proved to be a winning combination for continual renewals. i highly recommend it.

8445502,2,B004WOQFOA,"The language really put me off. Also it seems that the detectives spend a lot of time getting drunk and participating in recreational sex. No morals yet they are the ones to find the derelicts of society. The acting is very good though and the story lines interesting although pretty extreme and unbelievable. Interesting characters too. The one main character looks to be in her late 40s yet she is playing a 30 year old. All these young viral men are sleeping with her. Her character was very unlikeable.

8445510,5,B004WOQFOA,"I really enjoyed this season, mostly for the complex, interesting characters and their interrelationships.  The acting is good and its fun to hear the Manchester accents and dialect.  The plots seem timely and possible, and are often quite scary, but the ends don't always get tied up which is a bit frustrating.  I will say, I was quite disappointed that it ended so abruptly after only three episodes in season 5, when all other seasons had been full length.  That's a trend I don't much like.  Or, who knows: they could return in 2017 with Rachael as a new mum and all.",1508630400,,572,4.568627450980392
8445511,5,B004WOQFOA,"I have to admit I started watching this series only because I had already watched every other British crime series that seemed even remotely interesting, and I needed something new.  I was always hesitant about this series since it featured two female leads, which in my experience tends invariably to be a show aimed more at promoting some p.c. agenda, than to just tell a plain old good story.  Anyway, I finally chanced it, and OMG I'm so glad I did!  Finally, a woman-centered program which portrays capable, educated, authoritative women just doing the job they are set to do, and doing it very realistically and very well.  Refreshing is the word that keeps coming to mind.

The writing and dialog are both exceptional, the continuing storylines some of the most compelling I've seen.  This has got to be the least clich-ridden program I've encountered in a long while.  The pure human normality of the characters is astounding--the way they act & react to situations is so real-to-life, it is (here's that word) Refreshing!  And all done without bombast, without stretching credulity, without going over-the-top.  All done merely by exceptional writing & wonderful performances.

Give it a try--I almost guarantee you'll be sucked in!",1506643200,,1241,5.03921568627451
