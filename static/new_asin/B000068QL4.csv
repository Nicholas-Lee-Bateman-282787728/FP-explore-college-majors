7964473,5,B000068QL4,"Could have done without relying so much in stereotyping, but surprising good, excellent, suspenseful movie. 4 1/2 stars",1513209600,,119,5.666666666666667
7964474,4,B000068QL4,Not predictable.. Very original.,1512950400,,32,7.25
7964475,4,B000068QL4,"I can easily give this 4 stars...  while it's not any kind of ""blockbuster"", the performance put on by all the characters was well done...  and even with the ""seemingly"" slow story line of ""guy hiding in a tree from muggers"", it was remarkably suspenseful...

Beyond that, camera work was fine, sound quality was fine, not much to see in terms of special effects ( although not really much need for this style of movie )...  there was some stunt work / semi-fight scenes...

In terms of ""cons""...  I don't really have much to say on this one...  It's certainly not ""family friendly"", but I don't care about that...  Definitely one of the better movies I've seen on Prime lately ( and one of the better movies I've seen in general lately )...  As always, I reserve 5 star for movies that are over the top and make me want to watch again and again...  This movie doesn't make that mark, but it's well done, and I recommend...",1512864000,3,923,4.440476190476191
7964476,4,B000068QL4,"Great movie and character development. Even though it's a bit trite on how characters act, it captures you from the start and keeps the hold until the end.",1509840000,,155,4.571428571428571
7964477,4,B000068QL4,good movie.  thought provoking.  Unique.,1508112000,,40,6.8
7964478,3,B000068QL4,seems like a college play made into a movie. slow and a little predictable. a morality movie.,1507507200,,93,4.529411764705882
7964479,5,B000068QL4,An amazing movie with a talented cast.  Highly recommend.,1507161600,,57,5.333333333333333
7964480,5,B000068QL4,A surprisingly good film.  Much better acting and script as the film progressed.  Ultimately the plot turned out to be unpredictible.  Would like to see more from this director and these actors.,1506643200,3,194,5.0
7964481,5,B000068QL4,"Clever and well made, this simple film is very effective. It's a throwback to a time when intense thrillers made us asking the question ""what would I do?"" and anticipating clever developments. I really enjoyed it!",1506470400,3,213,4.944444444444445
7964482,4,B000068QL4,"Good, thought provoking story.  I didn't like all the profanity and would definately recomend this movie for mature audiences only.  That said, I have to say that I was completely caught up in the story.  A little too much ""poor baby"" for the gang members (there is never an excuse for senseless violence no matter how badly you think you've been treated) but overall well handled.  David Hewlett is excellent as Murray;  the entire movie hangs on his performance and he knocks it out of the park.",1395187200,5,497,4.666666666666667
