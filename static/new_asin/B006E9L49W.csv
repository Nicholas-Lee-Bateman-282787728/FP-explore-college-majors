4984534,5,B006E9L49W,I enjoyed the interviews as well as the race coverage.  You can watch this DVD multiple times and still enjoy the racing and scenery.,1303862400,2,133,4.541666666666667
4984535,4,B006E9L49W,Video is great.  We've watched it many times.  We can't wait for the snow to melt.  On the down side I had hope that it would take less than a month for the video to arrive.,1301011200,,173,3.75
4984536,5,B006E9L49W,"Amazing cycling documentary.  Best in years, hands down. If you love cycling, the Tour De France or you know someone who does, they will love this!

This DVD has it all: Spectacular breathtaking scenery, exhilarating music to match, Dramatic, dangerous hair-splitting sprints to the finish lines, masochistic climbs up winding Alpine roads, harrowing deadly descents, team strategy, and up close and personal interviews with today's best riders in the world, (which you never see on TV). A MUST HAVE DVD FOR ""BIKE SNOBS"" everwhere, and lovers of the TDF. Noncyclist will also find this interesting, and new found respect for one of the most difficult endurance events ever created. Great job to the makers of this fine cycling film.",1295481600,8,732,5.142857142857143
4984537,5,B006E9L49W,"For fans and non-fans of cycling this film is a beautifully filmed look into professional bike racing. With the advent of of small HD cams we get an up close and in the peleton look at bicycle racing. If you loved ""Hell on Wheels"" then you'll love this one, definitely add this too your collection.",1294963200,6,298,4.4363636363636365

8496828,4,B006E9L49W,Excellent documentary about George and the sport of cycling!,1418947200,,60,5.777777777777778
8496829,5,B006E9L49W,"Mark Cavendish is a phenom. He's funny, polite, adorable & an amazingly talented bike racer! They filmed this documentary to watch him win & he did just that. It is a historical film to watch. Loved it!",1390348800,,202,4.486486486486487
8496830,1,B006E9L49W,"If you have ever watched Versus' coverage of the tour de france, this video is a waste of money.  It was like an hour long commercial made by someone that had never been to a race or understood the sport. Very superficial interviews about the toughness required to finish the tour. Really? TDF tough?
Your money is better spent getting cable for the month of july and watching Versus' tour coverage.",1356566400,,399,4.619718309859155
8496831,5,B006E9L49W,"Legendary! Great movie, great insight... loved it!

13 more words? This is tricky so I'll just say I loved it.",1354665600,,110,4.5
8496832,1,B006E9L49W,"This nicely marketed video turns out to be boring, useless and annoying, that is, if you watch cycling and know anything about it. This shows NOTHING unique or inspiring or anything. Its just film footage with the most arrogant cyclist around, Cavendish, who does nothing for inspiration or likeability. I'd love to give it back.",1328140800,,329,5.0
8496833,5,B006E9L49W,"This dvd had lots of cycling along with a little history and persona. I was an avid Mark Cavendish hater because of his dominance in the sprints. Now I realize the incredible teamwork, personal effort and guts it takes to win a stage at any level. There is also some humorous moments in the team car. As an avid cyclist fan I highly recommend this one.",1327968000,2,352,4.348484848484849
8496834,5,B006E9L49W,This DVD is one of the best cycling documentaries I have seen. It's supposed to be about HTC Coumbia but you get a great insight into the dynamics within teams in general and some very interesting interviews. It's a must for every cycling fan even if you are not a fan of HTC.,1314489600,3,276,4.226415094339623
8496835,4,B006E9L49W,This was a really decent film and worth a watch.  My only real complaint about this film was the audio levels.  It would go from really loud to really quiet.  I felt like I was constantly adjusting the audio on my TV the whole way through.,1312156800,,239,4.1521739130434785
8496836,5,B006E9L49W,"I tried to see this film during its 2010 live tour, but the local showing was sold out. I finally got the DVD this spring and it's one of the best cycling documentaries I've seen. It brings you inside the HTC-Columbia team and shows you how the riders and staff in one of the sport's most successful teams work together. I must say, it was inspirational to watch the pre-race meetings and see just how dedicated the whole team was to a common goal.

A unique thing about this film compared to other cycling documentaries is that you end up getting to know the support riders and staff as well as the stars. Now I find myself cheering for Bernie Eisel as much as for Marc Cavendish, and when I found the team at the Tour of California this year I was more excited to see Brian Holm and Rolf Aldag (the sport directors who stole the show) than any of the riders!

If I had to criticize, I'd say the film doesn't seem to know what it's about. It's too focused on the HTC-Columbia team to be about the Tour de France, but it has too much general info and history about cycling to be about the HTC-Columbia team. This is probably good for viewers who are new to cycling, and it's really not a problem if you turn off your analytical mind and just enjoy the show. For example, there was a segment in the middle that featured the oldest surviving Tour de France rider, and it didn't fit the pace or tone of the film at all, yet it was an absolute gem that I was glad was included.

One nitpick is that the background music distracted from the film at times. And I could have done without the feed-zone ""arm cam.""

But the bottom line is I loved it, have already watched it twice and will watch it again. The second DVD of bonus material was all well worth watching too.",1310342400,4,1762,4.250746268656717
