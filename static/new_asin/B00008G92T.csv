8027395,5,B00008G92T,"I had this movie before and it was a very good ""B"" rated movie, except when I bought it from Amazon there was fifteen minutes cut form the DVD. I was hurt. Because I remembered the part that was cut.",1427328000,,199,4.0
8027396,2,B00008G92T,I had to give it 2 stars because it was bad but funny.  The three characters that they have on the cover are not even in the movie.  Three highly dangerous hitman agree to be paid by check to kill a witness? Really?  If you don't take this movie too seriously you'll enjoy it.,1296345600,,276,4.074074074074074
8027397,5,B00008G92T,"When a Crip, a Blood, and a member of one of LA's most notorious Latin gangs get together for a moral-filled manhunt it can only be called one thing, awesome!  Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I absolutely loved it.  If you're a connoisseur of movies that are so bad they're actually good, then you HAVE to buy this.  Otherwise, run, run as fast as you can.",1077840000,2,373,4.3
8027398,1,B00008G92T,this movie wasted my time and money this movie really (stinks) the actors cant act the story line is stupid and there is nood gang fights it deserved two stars because of the violence but thats all that was good,1077667200,,211,4.3
