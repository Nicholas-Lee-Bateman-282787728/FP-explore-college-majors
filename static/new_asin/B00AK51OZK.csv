This one covers superstorm Sandy -- covers its formation in the Caribbean, and then follows it as it strengthens and grows into a superstorm.  This happened because of several factors:  there was a blocking high pressure system off of Nova Scotia that didn't let it turn out to sea, then it joined up with a nor'easter and then the jet stream buckled and allowed it to move west over the East Coast of the U.S.  These factors both helped it strengthen and also move over the land and not harmlessly out to sea.

They show a lot of footage of people who were in the storm -- some lived through it, others did not.  Some people stayed behind, certain that it was not as bad as predicted but, as it turned out, it very much was.  The storm surge caused floods that filled the subway system in New York City, destroyed beach front property, caused the power grid to be shut down or (in at least one case) to explode when the sea water shorted out the electricity.  It took days to recover in the lucky places, and much longer in the unlucky ones.

The show ends with the question of how often these superstorms can happen:  are they related to global warming?  Possibly.  It's too early to tell, but they're still trying to learn more.  It may be that fewer hurricanes will result as temperatures continue to rise, but the individual storms will get stronger.

There's a lot to see in this episode and I've seen it several times.  If you have any interest in the weather, this will be something to watch.  It's pretty general purpose -- you'll pick up a lot of things as you watch, and more if you watch it again.",1422921600,2,1746,4.389408099688474

8552904,4,B00AK51OZK,"I bought this as a gift for my weather-oriented hubby. He loves it, and with his high degree of knowledge, I recommend it. What I like the most about it is that he keeps going back to repeat watching it and understands the jargon. I pick up new facts evertytime we watch it together.",1393372800,5,283,4.2592592592592595
8552905,4,B00AK51OZK,"This DVD focuses on the storm that hit the east coast in 2012, named Sandy. It has English subtitles and is about 60 minutes long.
The question is asked, are lethal storms becoming more frequent? There is some discussion at the end, but no real answers. The weather models are explored, especially the accurateness of the European model. Talking heads from universities and meteorologists also add to dialogues without too much irritation that they are being shown and not the storm. The film is of good quality, even those during the height of the storm and fires leave no doubt as to the destructive force.

The main emphasis is on the storm as it hit Manhattan and New Jersey. The plans and problems and tragedies are shown, including some of the victims and those that lost loved ones. There are no recriminations or no astonishments expressed that government workers are surprised that subway and electrical conduits flooded. This is a film that simply shows the facts and the misery.",1364083200,5,989,4.85207100591716
