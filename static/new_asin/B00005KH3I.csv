The only problem with the product is it is not a replication of the concert in whole, it is documentary look at the days leading up to the concert and then several snipets from the actual concert.
If you want to see the whole thing, your out of luck; but you do get to see several great performances by the leading actors of then AND now.

While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape.

1619749,5,B00005KH3I,"This is a documentary of a 1985 concert performance from Lincoln Center of Stephen Sondheim's 1971 ""Follies.""  A really great cast of Broadway greats was brought together for this concert that was basically put together is a few days.  Although the backstage elements of the show are great (e.g., showing actors working through dance numbers, flubbing lyrics, Sondheim talking with the actors), the real interest of the show is in the performaces themselves that make up about half of the 90 minute documentary.  The unfortunate thing about the documentary is that we only see about half the concert, mostly in the form of excerpts.  It really would have been much better to see a COMPLETE version of the concert. One really wonders why this wasn't filmed and made available in some format.  There is, however, a 2-CD album of the whole concert to fill in the gaps.
This concern aside, the concert is a great chance to see the likes of Barbara Cook, Lee Remick, George Hearn, Carol Burnett,  Elaine Stritch, and Adolph Green and Betty Comden singing and within the frame of a concert performance) acting their way through one of the great musicals of our age.

1619820,3,B00005KH3I,"Fans hate to admit it, but the 1971 FOLLIES had extremely mixed reviews, ran less than two years, and was a massive financial disaster for its backers.  Even the original soundtrack was something of a failure: rather than spend the money for a double album, Capitol Records cut the score to ribbons and issued a single album partial.  Even so, the score was greatly admired, and in 1986 an exceptional group of performers came together with the New York Philharmonic to make what the hoped would be a definative live recording.  But if you want to hear that recording, you'll have to buy the CD--the at about ninety minutes, the film of FOLLIES IN CONCERT is actually about half as long as the show itself, and at least thirty minutes of the film is devoted to interviews with those working with the project.  So if you are expecting to see the concert in full, give it up right now, it ain't gonna happen.

On the other hand, it is interesting to watch the likes of Lee Remick, Barbara Cook, and Elaine Stritch as they prep for their roles in the show--and what we are allowed to see of the show is quite fascinating, with Elain Stritch a knock out with ""Broadway Baby"" Carol Burnett unexpectedly effective with ""I'm Still Here,"" and Mandy Patankin amazing with ""The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues.""  Chopped and truncated as they are in this film, FOLLIES is still amazing stuff.  Recommended, though, for diehard fans who are determined to have every scrap of material associated with the play; if you're really interested in this concert version, you'd do better to buy the CD.

1619821,4,B00005KH3I,I had heard this concert before and have always enjoy Sondheim's music.  So I decided to purchase this DVD.  It is one of my favorites.,1328745600,,135,4.36
1619822,5,B00005KH3I,This is a great DVD. Sondheim is a genius his songs are incredably witty aand poignent. the cast collected for this production was topnotch. everyone is on their best performance. the rehersal footage and backstage scenes are very interesting.,1316390400,,243,5.256410256410256
1619823,3,B00005KH3I,"We don't get to see enough of it. I went into this knowing that only about half the concert was there, and I would have been ok (though slightly annoyed) with that, if the half they kept had been in tact. As it is, the songs they keep are sometimes cut completely in half. It's a bloody shame, because we only get to see small pieces of the whole. The ones they do keep in tact are of course wonderful. It doesn't make sense, though. After all, this concert was produced for the sake of completion.

The real attraction here is the documentary footage, which provides a wonderful look backstage at rehersals and the workings of the concert (It's amazing that they put it together in only a few days), but it only makes you ache to see more the actual show.

I reccomend viewing this for the interviews and for what little of the show they do have, but be aware that it's not the whole show.

Maybe someday, we'll have the entire concert on DVD.",1304380800,2,944,4.322033898305085
1619824,4,B00005KH3I,"On Friday evening September 6, 1985, my then girlfriend and I attended American Ballet Theatre's performance of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" at the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.  The tickets were one of my birthday presents to her, but that was hardly the star attraction at Lincoln Center that evening.  As we got out of our taxi in front of the Lincoln Center Plaza several individuals asking if we had tickets for ""Follies in Concert"" bombarded us.  This was a sold out star-studded concert version of the 1971 Broadway musical ""Follies"" at the Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Philharmonic.  As we strolled past the Avery Fisher Hall and the milling crowds there was a palpable electricity and excitement in the air, this was a BIG event!  I gazed wistfully over, wishing we were attending that instead of ""Romeo and Juliet"", even though Juliet was being danced by Leslie Browne the lovely young ballerina from the film ""The Turning Point"".

In the spring of next year, this documentary was aired on PBS, and I saw it, and if one wasn't fortunate enough to attend either of the two performances, this was an excellent substitute.  A couple of years ago my wife gave me the DVD as a Christmas present, and it was great to reacquaint myself.  If you have any interest in musical theatre I highly recommend this.  ""Follies"" when it opened in 1971 to mixed to rave reviews ran a year, but didn't recoup its cost, and over the years became a cult musical.  The Stephen Sondheim score is extensive, and when recorded on the original cast album was truncated so it would fit on just one record when it really needed two.  This ""Follies in Concert"" purpose was to get a complete recording of the score and to justify this a special occasion was needed.  So, an impeccable cast was assembled under the guidance of Sondheim that besides singing the score would also enact a limited version of the book.  There would be two performances, Friday September 6 and Saturday September 7, with recordings being done both evenings and compiling the best in the final release.  I had already purchased the ""Romeo and Juliet"" tickets for Friday night, but even if I wanted to attend the Saturday performance given the cast and the subject, tickets were sold out for both dates within a couple of hours the first day of sale.

Speaking of the cast, the premise of the show is a reunion of performers of the ""Weisman (read Ziegfeld) Follies"" in the theatre where they were performed that is set for demolition.  The main characters are two unhappily married couples that used to be best friends and have a complicated past together.  They are played by Lee Remick and George Hearn as Phyllis and Ben Stone, and Barbara Cook and Mandy Patimkin as Sally and Buddy Plummer. The other characters are ""Follies"" alumni and include Carol Burnett, Elaine Stritch, Phyllis Newman, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.

Stephen Sondheim himself gives the introduction, and then we are taken into three grueling days of rehearsal.  Dry Martini voiced Elaine Stritch sums it up bluntly right away ""This is hysterical, we are doing a musical in THREE days!""  We get a rare opportunity to see the creative process at work, as we see and hear the performers working through their characters and trying to master them.  Insights and worries are shared, we witness their goofs and frustrations, and moments of satisfaction as it starts to come together and work.  You see the performers reactions to their peer's songs in rehearsal.  A serious setback occurs two days into rehearsal when director Herbert Ross is called back to Los Angeles on an emergency.  Finally, opening night and we see all the performers backstage moments before the performance starts at their most naked and vulnerable.  All in all, an invaluable if speeded up, abridged look at the preproduction of a major musical.

Now on to the musical numbers, most are uniformly excellent, my only quibble would be quite a few of the numbers are cut and not performed in their entirety, and several are not performed at all, which is a damned shame.  That is the big drawback of this documentary, it's approximately ninety minutes, and it easily could have been extended by another half hour to capture more of the actual performances, a mystery as to why it wasn't.  Still, let's be grateful to have some record of such a legendary gala occasion.

Here are the highlights in my perception: Elaine Stritch returning to New York after twelve years performing in London knocking ""Broadway Baby"" out of the ballpark with her wry, deadpan delivery finding both the humor and the heartbreak in the words.  ""In Buddy's Eyes"" is haunting in Barbara Cook's delivery, Stephen Sondheim himself raved, saying she had brought an entirely different but totally valid interpretation, much more emotionally moving than what he originally intended.  You can tell Phyllis Newman and her backup singers Lee Remick, Barbara Cook, Elaine Stritch, Betty Comden and Liliane Montevecchi are having a great time with ""Who's That Woman?"" and so judging by the tumultuous applause at the conclusion did the audience, as did I.  There is a quiet, reflective quality as Carol Burnett begins ""I'm Still Here"", that builds in strength and color finishing on a note of defiant triumph.  Retired opera singer Licia Albanese and at the time up and coming opera singer Erie Mills blend beautifully in the sentimental ""One Last Kiss"".  The light, lilting waltz  ""Could I Leave You?""  lyrics are laced with an elegant yet searing vitriol in Lee Remick's rendition that owes much to her being such a fine actress.  Four talented youngsters, Howard McGillin, Daisy Prince, Jim Walton and Liz Callaway have an eager charm and optimism in ""You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through"", that makes you regret this is one of the numbers that is very heavily edited, a pity when you hear their full version on the finished album.

In the ""Follies"" section, it's the ladies who excel.  Barbara Cook looking and sounding like a blonde angel in shimmering blue touches the heart in the torch song ""Losing My Mind"" while Lee Remick a very sexy lady in slinky red sequins and boa, is delicious in the tongue twisting ""Story of Lucy and Jessie"".  While Mandy Patimkin has a very melodious tenor, he is aware of it, and tends to need a strong hand to calm him down, ""Buddy's Blues"" is a little too much on the showboat, ""aren't I wonderful!"" side, for my taste.  George Hearn fares much better with ""Live, Love, Laugh"", which is similar to but nowhere near as good as ""Rose's Turn"" from ""Gypsy"", also penned by Sondheim, that being a nervous breakdown in song.

Afterwards, the curtain calls with Sondheim taking a bow, and post performance euphoria and relief.  So in closing, yes it's half a loaf, but such a scrumptious, richly flavored one that if you're a theatre aficionado you want to sample it at least once!",1298764800,10,6918,4.8221845893310755

1619828,4,B00005KH3I,"I've learned a lot about this production from reading some of the other reviewers commentary below.  One very informative posting included quotes from Lee Remick that it was unlikely that a more complete version of the concert would ever be released since there wasn't more footage in anybody's vault (although I'm not sure why the concert's having been a benefit would have put a crimp on recording it in its entirety).  But I suspect that the fact that it was recorded BEFORE the DVD era was the main problem.  Nowadays anyone filming such an event would probably record the event in full and then--as many reviewers have suggested--included a ""Making Of""  documentary to be included as ""Disk Two.""  Nowadays, I suspect, that kind of packaging would be a virtual given.

Whether or not you find the current available product acceptable may depend on whether you're a ""half full"" or ""half empty"" type.  Me, I'm enough of the former to be very glad to have this.  But then, I didn't pay full price AND I had just come off seeing an above average regional production so the story was fresh in my mind (and filling in the blanks relatively easy).

It's not clear whether or not, the entire concert would have given neophyte viewers an adequate sense of the plot or not.  Some might say that the plot was minimal to begin with.  Still the audience benefits from knowing who Ben and Phyllis and Buddy and Sally are (by the way, was Sondheim a fan of the old DICK VAN DYKE SHOW?  I mean, BUDDY AND SALLY, c'mon).  The others, sketchy enough in the stage production, are strictly cameos, and that can be confusing.

The documentary describes the assembled artists as pretty much a dream cast, and that would certainly seem to be a fair description:  George Hearn, Lee Remick, Mandy Patinkin, and Barbara Cook as your leads with luminaries of stage and screen like Elaine Stritch and Carol Burnett on hand.  While Remick and Burnett are known primarily for their work on TV and in film, they both had experience in the musical theater and more than hold their own in this production.  Cook, mainly a concert performer nowadays, provides several musical highlights, including a memorable ""In Buddy's Eyes.""  Patinkin has been criticized here and elsewhere for hamming it up--and it probably was NOT a good idea to get rid of the ""Comic Sally"" and ""Comic Phyllis"" figures in favor of a straight solo on ""Buddy's Blues.""  I won't dispute the claim made elsewhere on the page that this was done at Patinkin's insistence, but I don't know that for sure.  Suffice it to say that it works so well done as a duet that it's a shame to lose that kind of real life back and forth.  And we all know that Mandy has a strong, sustained falsetto, but it's not used to great effect here.

Along with Remick and Elaine Stritch, George Hearn proves most masterful at interpreting the lyrics.  The dramatized breakdown in ""Live, Laugh and Love"" is tough to pull off under the best of circumstances.  To do it successfully as a concert piece, divorced--for the most part--of any real context is quite a feat.  And that's exactly what Hearn does here.

There will purists out there (and God love 'em) for whom the fragmented nature of FOLLIES IN CONCERT will never do.  Many would likely have found even a full-length concert version lacking.  These folks make several valid points, not the least of which is that the current product probably would have more accurately been called THE MAKING OF FOLLIES IN CONCERT. But for what it is, it works.  There is a nice flow to it, and even the songs that are abbreviated are not really (IMO) totally butchered.  The cuts do give one incentive to buy the CD, however, which from a marketing standpoint, may have been a pretty clever idea.

Seriously, though, if additional footage ever is dug up, a more complete version should definitely be considered.  If the commentary here is any indication, they'd definitely be a market for the whole shebang.  And what a shebang, it'd be.",1235001600,,3994,4.692528735632184

Unfortunately, this film is also heavily edited and, therefore, is as guilty as the original cast recording.  But with a cast like this, it's a minor quibble.

The only problem is, they forgot to include Disc 1, ""Follies"".

OOPS!!

What happened?  Actually, no one really knows.  Was it ever actually said that the video of the concert (not the concert itself or it's audio facsimile) was to be a complete representation of Sondheim's show?  That is unsure.

Were there problems?  With a cast as talented and, dare we say, as ego driven as this, we must assume so.

One problem shown, but carefully glossed over in the documentary, is the fact that the show's stage director, Herb Ross,  bailed out half way through the four day rehearsal schedule, leaving cast and crew to fend for themselves.  He opted to leave because an unnamed film he was involved in the production of (Director? Writer? Producer?"") was in trouble and needed his presence post haste.  The problem is, according to Internet Movie Database, Mr. Ross had no productions released for that entire year as either a writer, producer or director.  Why did he leave?  Was this the cause of the somewhat disjointed performance (including the always-difficult Mandy Patinkin's disastrous performance of ""Buddy's Blues"").  Possibly.

Did Ross' defection cause the concert to not be filmed?  Well, the camera's were definitely there.  We know that.  Footage was shot.  Are we to believe that whomever was left in charge of the filming itself decided what snippets would be filmed?  Were camera personnel actually told ""Now when so-and-so starts to sing such-and-such, stop filming?  That seems odd to me.

Or, amazing though it seems to us now, is it just possible some 20 odd years ago it still wasn't deemed important enough to posterity that a Stephen Sondhiem show was to be given a single performance more-or-less complete?

What happened?  Actually, no one really knows.

And if they do know, they ain't talking.

After all, this is only one of the biggest screw-ups in Broadway history!",1231459200,,1984,4.9154078549848945
1619831,1,B00005KH3I,"THIS IS NOT FOLLIES IN CONCERT. It is a PBS documentary about the coming together of, and performances of Follies In Concert. But do not be misled and think you will get the entire concert...not even close. I remember watching the initial airing of this on television and at one point stood up and screamed at the TV. I could not beleive that what should have been an historic, television event, was actually a schmaltzy, documentary about the concert. I, like most every person I knew who saw this at the time, was pissed! Why? Why? Why couldn't they have taped and shown the entire concert instead of this 90 minute fluff? Yes, I am sure all the performers were excited to be performing in this ""once in a lifetime"" event, I got that, but why couldn't they have shown it in it's completion as they do with other things. I really didn't need to see Elaine Stritch, sans make-up, pulling on her leotard. I would have liked to have seen her perform Broadway Baby in it's entirety however. And with the most astonishing cast ever assembled it was truly heartbreaking.
Shame on PBS for robbing Sondheim and theater fans of the chance to see the whole concert. Get the CD, skip this rip-off!!",1220140800,,1188,4.55607476635514
1619832,5,B00005KH3I,"In spite of the fact that I am a Follies Fanatic, junkie, and completist, I missed this concert. Back in 1971, I was too young to fully appreciate Follies and although I bought the OBC and loved it, I didn't get to see FOLLIES on stage before it closed.

By the time 1985 rolled around, I was ecstatic at the thought of this revival and planned on buying tickets and attending. It ""sold out"" within an hour or so and I coudn't get tickets. I should have slept on the ground in front of Lincoln Center.

Anyway,the concert gave us a new cast recording with almost all the music restored. And then, there was the VHS of this presentation, half-concert and half documentary. I purchased the VHS and, years later DVD. The DVD is only the VHS material transferred to DVD. There were no new additions but I think I prefer the DVD because the sound and picture are ever so slightly better. The back stage comments and rehearsals are wonderful for any musical theater fan and anyone who has ever been involved in the production of a musical on any scale from Community Theater to Broadway. It's fun to see these big name producers and legendary stars have trouble with their lyrics, squirm and get the jitters just like they were novices. It's still hard work, and it never gets easy. But,as Elaine Stritch says waiting in the wings to go on ""It's Fun, Gawdammit!"".  You get all the excitement of an opening night as seen through the eyes of these performers. I actually met Lee Remick not too long after this concert. She was as beautiful, charming and as gracious as one could imagine. I asked her if there would ever be a release of the entire concert and she said ""No, owing to the fact that the concert was a benefit"". She went on to say that she didn't believe the entire concert was even recorded on video, so, there's probably nothing ""in the vaults"" to re-construct. Still, watching Stritch backstage telling jokes and being Elaine Stritch is a howl and finally watching her NAIL ""Broadway Baby"" shows you why she is a legend. I fell in love with Barbara Cook in this concert. With all due respect to the late Dorothy Collins, Barbara's version of ""Losing My Mind"" is such perfection that she renders the song almost untouchable by anyone else. Carol Burnett blew this audience away as Carlotta singing ""I'm Still Here"". As I said, I loved Lee Remick personally but the truth be told, she fell a little behind on ""Lucy and Jesse"". I love George Hearn too, but I found him a little too ""Operatic"" for this musical. The only major disappointment came from Mandy Patinkin. I admire his talent but sometimes he goes too far. He was supposed to sing ""Buddy's Blues"" with Stritch as Comic sally and Burnett as Margie and then decided to do it solo singing all three parts himself. What a missed opportunity! What a Show-off! What a Ham! I had some friends that did see this concert in person. They told me that Mandy ""went up"" (Forgot his lyrics) and had to start all over again during this song. Good for him! Serves him right!

I finally saw this show in a revival at City Center not too long ago. It was great. It moved me all over again in all the same places. Broadway Baby, One More Kiss, Losing My Mind, You're gonna love tomorrow, I'm Still here. Even with an entirely different cast, the magic is there. There's more to this musical than meets the ear and it deserves to be seen complete in all its glory.

Still, this truncated DVD version is all we have until Rob Marshall or somebody like him manages to get the movie version off the ground.

Hollywood was supposed to film this in the 70's. It would have starred Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and Shirley Maclaine. Star turns were to go to Bette Davis (""I'm Still here""), Joan Crawford (""Broadway Baby"") and Joan Blondell (""Who's that Woman"" I guess). Now, even my contemporaries like Barbra Streisand are too old to play the principals. I think I'd like to see Catherine Zeta-Jones as Phyllis and folks from my generation as the old bags. Can't you see Liza Minelli singing ""Broadway Baby"", Bette Midler singing ""Whose That Woman"" and Cher singing ""I'm Still Here"". How much longer will Hollywood wait to do it?

I hope Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd"" is a huge hit; then we might hve a chance of seeing FOLLIES done as a movie. In the meantime: 5 STARS for this DVD: what it is, what it represents and the performers it showcases.",1197590400,5,4394,4.519496855345912
1619833,1,B00005KH3I,"I REALLY like the soundtrack and the originally broadcast show I saw on PBS years ago.  The stars and the songs are incredible.  However, this DVD only shows parts of most of the songs and omits some of the very best songs and scenes altogether.  It is also a grainy copy that looks like it was dubbed on an old VHS video tape.  Please save yourself the time, the money, and the memories, if you have seen this show before.  Sometimes the memories are better than the reality.  Athough that is also the message of this musical, it should not be a message conveyed to consumers by the publishers of this poorly crafted DVD.",1187913600,3,622,4.412280701754386
1619834,4,B00005KH3I,"""Beautiful Girls"". What a fantastic opportunity for lovers of Broadway musicals to see the behind the scenes creation and making of a successful musical in four days. This film is in part documentary combined with hi-lights of the finished performance at Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic. The story line of ""Beautiful Women"" attending a Follies Reunion so many years into retirement is powerful and awakens thoughts of aging. Mandy Patinkin, Carol Burnett, Barbara Cook and Lee Remick lead an all star cast in this Steven Sondheim Classic. You might want to view this film more than once.",1099353600,4,601,5.08080808080808
1619835,5,B00005KH3I,"True...this is not ""the best"" documentary film ever made, although it IS pretty darned good, and part of the criticism may come because most of us who would want to see this would be just as happy with just one long uncut take of the concert on film...but we do have that on CD (thank goodness!). And what a concert it was!!! This is as near a dream cast as one could hope for. Of course there will be be endless quibbling over that opinion, and endless comparisons to the OBC...that's the glory of theatre...many opinions. But the overall arc and energy of this concert is amazing and that cannot be disputed...the CD is a classic... and one of those rare few ""I wish I were there"" events captured on recording. That said, the documentary does offer delight in the backstage glimpses it gives, especiallly after several (hundred? thousand?) listenings to the CD. For instance...I went into this already worshipping and adoring Barbara Cook (for me there can be no other Sally Durant), but after watching, I was really hooked onto Lee Remick too. And there were lots of discovery moments like that because of the documentary...so it did indeed, bring me someplace that the concert CD alone did not, and for that I truly value this DVD. So, perfect? No. (And franky, what is?) But it is worth watching and re-watching, especially if you are a total Follies junky, or learning to become one. How many other backstage stories can you say that of? For me, darned few...this one's a keeper. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1067731200,11,1505,4.704545454545454
1619836,4,B00005KH3I,"This is by far my favorite musical, not the concert but the actual musical from the 70's. When i saw Alexis Smith the first time i fell deeply in love. Of course i was only 24 at the time. Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers. Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls.. The likes of this will never come again.",1026604800,11,831,4.437908496732026
1619837,4,B00005KH3I,"It has been noted several times that this DVD is not a recording of the famous concert at Lincoln Center, but a documentary of that concert including rehearsals and some of the concert.  The concert was used as the platform to make the first full recording of this incredible score.  Many may not realise that in order to preserve the show on 1 LP, the original Broadway cast recording had substantial cuts made while it was being recorded.  The OBC cd's released later include only one cut song from that original cast recording.  The OBC recording of Follies is a crime to be sure.
But back to the DVD.  This is an interesting behind the scenes look at the mad house it took to present a full stage concert of Follies in about a week.  It is interesting to watch Thomas Z. Shepherd at work here as the record producer. (An interesting comparison would be to buy the documentary of the recording of Company to see a younger Sheperd at work) There are scenes in the rehearsal halls, the terror of opening night and wonderful scenes on stage.
If you are a theater lover, this DVD is a wonderful documentary of how a show like this is put together.  And there are wonderful clips of Carol Burnett singing ""I'm Still Here""  and Elaine Stritch singing ""Broadway Baby"".  And who can ever resist Barbara Cook?
The packaging may be confusing for die hard theater fans.  The DVD cover uses the famous David Byrd logo from the original Broadway cast and not the photograph cover from the recording.  But don't let that fool you, this documentary is worthy of any serious theater lovers collection.",1021248000,11,1588,4.595744680851064
