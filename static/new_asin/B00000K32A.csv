7914225,3,B00000K32A,It wasn't clear to me that I was buying a VHS tape.  I needed a DVD format.,1417910400,,75,3.411764705882353
7914226,5,B00000K32A,"The Christmas episode remains, perhaps, my favorite Mr. Bean episode.  It has all the elements of classic Bean... and it was the first episode I ever saw.  He's up to the usual pranks and innocent mischief, and done rightly - he isn't irritating or misbehaving because he's a miscreant - he simply doesn't know any better.  Very funny!
The other episode is fairly lackluster, in my mind... instead of impish, he seems instead to have a vendetta - which is a little less fun (and thus less funny).  There are some very funny scenarios, however, and while it isn't amongst the best of the episodes, it is certainly good for a laugh.  If you only buy one Mr. Bean tape, I'd say it'd be a toss up (with either the first or the third tapes).  Get two at minimum, and make sure this is one of them!!!",1013299200,4,794,4.36734693877551
7914227,5,B00000K32A,"This one of the best Mr. Bean's I've ever seen. When I watched it at home, I laughed my head off!  Thsi I think will be a great show to watch at home anytime, and everywhere.  This indeed deserves five stars.",997488000,2,208,4.048780487804878
7914228,3,B00000K32A,"Including the classic episode Merry Christmas Mr Bean, this selection is among the better tapes in this series. Unfortunately, the overall impression decreases becauses of the other sketch where Mr Bean fools around in a hotel - and this, in the end, just becomes too long and too much.",976060800,3,286,4.857142857142857
7914229,5,B00000K32A,"This video is Mr. Bean at his best!  His holiday antics are so incredibly funny, I find myself watching this one again and again.  You'll never see Harrod's window display in the same light.  From the turkey fiasco to Mr.  Bean's holiday home decorating techniques, his musical talents, and his  hidden romantic side, this video is priceless!",944784000,8,342,4.9298245614035086
