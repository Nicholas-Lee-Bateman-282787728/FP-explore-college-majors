5986422,1,B00FF1UNJM,"Most of the episodes don't play. At first I thought it was the DVD player but after 2 televisions and 3 DVD players we have no doubt that it's the dvd's them selves. From now on I will see to it that I get one season at a time, overall I will pay more but in this case I could have stopped ordering them when they wouldn't play. That's if I choose to get any dvd's from Amazon in the future  (maybe this is why I should get this kind of stuff from an actual store instead of the mail)",1504224000,3,484,3.84

5986424,1,B00FF1UNJM,"Bought this awhile back, finally watching it. Bad idea putting it off! It's obviously a knock off. It constantly stops playing, then jumps ahead 30 seconds to a minute and a half. Total junk, and a waste of good money!",1501891200,4,218,4.475

5986426,3,B00FF1UNJM,"I ordered a set of The Complete Collection, which was unplayable.  Then I ordered a replacement set and it played ok.  I have no idea why the difference between the two sets.  I did notice that the unplayable set did not have the individual DVD cases wrapped in plastic.  The set that did work had each case wrapped.  Just something to watch for.",1501200000,2,346,4.428571428571429
5986427,1,B00FF1UNJM,"In the past year, almost all reviewers (and likely non-reviewers) have noted that this set has defective discs.  Unfortunately, I am one of the frustrated buyers.  Season 1 began the problem with dual disc freezing / skipping.  By Season 4, it was each disc (the series has 3 episodes on each side of the disc).  The problem occurs during the 3rd episode on each side.  The disc freezes and then it forwards to a later time in the episode.  I've lost 5-15 minutes of each of these 48 minute episodes.  I have been able to play back and recover 1-2 minutes.  I have read that replacements have done no good and that the problem persists.  AMAZON has some responsibility for these problems, as they are fulfilling their 3rd party sellers' products.  If the product is not being fixed (and there's no evidence of this), then AMAZON should discontinue selling this product and notify its sellers accordingly.  It is a $170 set.  Whether purchasing the individual seasons does any good, I don't know.",1500940800,5,995,4.72093023255814

My husband was sink first of the year we had to stay home. I would like to have a set that will work. I will tell my family and friends not to buy from you if I can not get a new set that will work like it should. Thank you,1498867200,5,386,3.397727272727273

5986430,3,B00FF1UNJM,"The last show on each disk has troubles playing, It pixsalated and finally stops playing. This is on a standard DVD player or blue ray.  The recording technology must not been to good back then and they most likely used a compression technique the more recent players can't read. there is usually 3 on a side so you really only get to see about 2/3 of the series.",1498348800,7,363,4.338235294117647

5986436,2,B00FF1UNJM,"Love the show but I think they put too many episodes on each disc. The last episode in practically every side of every disc would freeze and then just skip ahead, so we couldn't see key parts of the story. This didn't happen with the last season where they only recorded in one side of the disc. I am going to send these back. I just don't think I should have to pay $179 to have something this defective in my library.",1494892800,6,419,4.121951219512195

5986452,2,B00FF1UNJM,"I love this show so imagine my disappointment when I had found defective DVDs just in the first few seasons of this 14 season show. I have just started watching it from the beginning.

I have no idea how to correct the problem so I sit with many lost shows and disappointment. This collection doesn't come cheaply. It should be perfect as it is brand new.
What a shame
Edited to add.  Season 3 one entire episode is missing. Bad spots in another episode.  The frustration with this purchase is building.

5986496,3,B00FF1UNJM,"Defective Discs: I bought this new on another online retailer. I have had all these individually for years but sold them as they were worn but playable, huge mistake! Now I have gone in my pocket for replacement discs and likely will have to re-buy season 11 and 13 again.

Season 12 disc 1 seems to be one that a lot of people have had issues with, I bought a replacement online. Also season 11 had the last 2 episodes on every side of all the discs not work.

Also season 13 did the same on disc 1, the last 2 episodes did not play on both sides of discs 1. I bought season 13 again second hand that also had this issue on season 13, so I am at a loss, should I buy the series or just those seasons on Amazon video and just save copies to my portable hard drives? I suppose I could buy a Roku for my analog TV, ""I know I don't have a flat screen"" The Fire stick would be a good investment, but darn it I like the physical DVDs. This has been a whole lot of trouble, and really grating on my nerves.

My research shows ""reading the reviews for the individual seasons, here and elsewhere"" This has been an ongoing issue with these discs for years, many defective discs are in circulation. People are selling off replacement discs form many of these seasons because they also had to re-buy.

 I think the double sided discs have issues, they need a new 2016 COMPLETE set with 1 sided discs per season not re-packaging these old sets like this. I'd buy it, I would pay $200 or more for a new set, done right with a book, new packaging, and all the extra features, like reunions and specials made for the discs, The powers that be need to Get it done!",1468454400,2,1648,4.153605015673981

BUYER BEWARE: BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
These sets are mostly double sided and have a manufacturing defect that causes the discs to deteriorate over time. I bought these sets at the time of release and they worked perfectly. The have been stored under cool dry conditions in a library climate controlled environment and nevertheless the discs have deteriorated.

The reflective coating had oxidized and the discs are unable to be read by multiple players. When the have able to be read, the defect has caused the discs to skip or lock.
