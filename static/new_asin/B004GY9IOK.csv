8429040,3,B004GY9IOK,"2 DVD box set of early Charles Bronson TV episodes. All in balck & white & all full frame as expected. Quality varies although I did not watch trhe 2 Man With A Camera or US Marshall episodes. Biff Baker has the TMG logo burnt onto the screen, which can be irritating.

Due to the age I would say acceptable, although I have the complete Man With A Camera, which is remastered as best as can be.

Episodes are;
Man With A Camera - String Of Pearls & Missing
M - Squad - The Fight
Federal Men - The Case Of The Deadly Dilemma
US Marshal - Pursuit
Laramine - Street Of Hate & Run Of The Hunted
Biff Baker USA - Alpine Assignment
Red Skelton - Fancy Footwork
Medi - My Brother Joe
Riverboat - Zig Zag
Roy Rogers Show - The Knockout

All good episodes & a nice chance to see early Bronson. Two episodes also have a young Lee Marvin.

Mine came in a tin, but the dvd is in a case inside.",1337299200,9,882,3.9943181818181817
