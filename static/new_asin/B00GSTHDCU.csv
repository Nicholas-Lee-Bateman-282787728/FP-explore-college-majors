6108366,5,B00GSTHDCU,"Armada is a great series for any Transformers fan! Watching it again was very enjoyable, just like when it first aired on Cartoon Network in 2002.",1398729600,,146,4.653846153846154
6108367,5,B00GSTHDCU,"Everything was perfect!! Speedy service! A++++++!

Very good packaging!!

Almost as good as the original series! I remember watching this years ago. And now I finally have the entire series",1398556800,,189,5.266666666666667

6108370,5,B00GSTHDCU,"I had watched a couple of episodes back when I was in school back in the year 2002 when it aired on Cartoon Network, but with this DVD I can finally relive the episodes I had watched and others I hadn't seen before. Everything in this series is quite fascinating including more plot holes in this series, the search for the Mini-Cons, the servant of Unicron Sideways, and Megatron who is voiced by the same actor that did Megatron in Beast Wars Transformers David KAye while Optimus prime is voiced by Gary Chalk the actor that did Optimus Primal in Beast Wars and Beast Machines. If you are a fan of the Transformers Armada franchise than i expect you to get it to add to your dvd set.",1397260800,,686,4.3671875
6108371,1,B00GSTHDCU,"Because it does not play in my country, it is NTSC not PAL, i did not see it specified in the item description.",1396656000,,111,3.869565217391304
6108372,4,B00GSTHDCU,"Transformers: Armada has always been one of my top favorite transformers series. This one involves the autobots facing the decepticons in a race to recover all the mini cons that crash landed in earth. Now with every ""kids"" show, of course there are human characters and of course there are young kids who have to be involved somehow.

Which brings me to my next point: the animation. The way all human characters are animated in this show is hilariously bad. It's almost cringy. This show was jointly made by Habro and a Japanese production company, so it's almost disappointing how bad it is. However, if you can look past how bad the kids are animated, you'll be able to appreciate how really well done the actual transformers themselves were redesigned and animated. So if you enjoy transformers and don't mind a little bit of slight animation flaws, then this is a great one to add to your collection.",1395446400,3,906,4.734177215189874
6108373,4,B00GSTHDCU,"""Transformers Armada: The Complete Series"" delivers all 52 episodes of the show on eight DVDs. After escaping Cybertron, a ship carrying the Mini-Cons is forced to crashland in Earth's solar system. Millions of years later, the Decepticons are alerted to their presence. It's up to Optimus Prime and his band of Autobots to keep the Mini-Cons and humanity out of danger.

Most people remember ""Transformers Armada"" as being the show that Peter Cullen didn't voice Optimus Prime for. If you can just look past that, you'll find an exciting series that kicks off the Unicron Trilogy. It's an interesting reboot of the Transformers legend that takes their story in a whole different direction. This series was a joint venture between Hasbro and their Japanese counterpart Takara, which gives it more of an anime feel.

I actually prefer the animation for ""Transformers Armada"" more than I do ""Generation 1.""",1394150400,4,904,5.101351351351352

6108535,5,B00GSTHDCU,"Love this series. It brings back a lot of memories of watching it when I was younger and it's one of the best animated series of Transformers, second only to the great Generation One. Sure some of the plots are a bit kid-ish, but that's what they were supposed to be. The overall story still holds up in my eyes.",1487289600,,312,4.216666666666667
6108536,5,B00GSTHDCU,"I miss watching this series on Fox and Cartoon Network back in the day. And now I got ALL three armada, Energon, and Cybertron for a very good price. You can't go wrong.",1486598400,,169,4.151515151515151

6108539,1,B00GSTHDCU,This is some Japanese animated crap. If you like dragon ball Z and that sort of nonsense then youll probably like this,1481673600,,118,4.409090909090909

6108543,5,B00GSTHDCU,"I remember seeing this on Cartoon Network when I was a kid. It was awesome then, and it still awesome now. The animation is amazing and the characters are memorable. I still get excited when I hear that rocking theme song. It's pretty dialog heavy, and the first episode is a bit out pf sync. This is an awesome series, I recommend adding it to your Transformers collection.",1458259200,,374,4.514705882352941
6108566,4,B00GSTHDCU,Great DVD,1455408000,,9,4.0
6108567,5,B00GSTHDCU,very nice,1449964800,,9,4.0
6108568,4,B00GSTHDCU,Fun cartoon series. Series starts off a little slow and then picks up speed and gets really good the last 12 or so episodes. I do recommend.,1447632000,,140,4.222222222222222
6108569,5,B00GSTHDCU,"Say what you like about this series, it's a classic (of the same ""every bit as much nostalgia rather than production quality"" lovely cheesy feeling that G1 has) I've been searching for a DVD version of the entire series for a long time, only finding it for crazy expensive prices. Finally, I found it here on Amazon! I've only gotten about three discs into the series so far, but it seems to be how I remember it. There is a slightly odd error in my discs where the last part of a scene repeats during the transition between scenes, but I don't mind too much given how much less expensive this version is than the others I've seen for sale. Picture quality is definitely a lot better than watching uploaded old VHS tapes on youtube!

I've seen some of the commenters saying that the voices don't seem to match the character's mouths, and part of that could be because the series was originally Japanese and later dubbed in English. The dialogue gets a bit odd sometimes as a result.

Another complaint that I saw is that there is no option to watch each individual episode. I did not have that problem? The menu says ""Play All"" and then underneath it ""Episodes"", and if you select ""Episodes"", it takes you to the individual episode menu. Perhaps that was the confusion, because it looks like it says ""Play All Episodes""

If you're a fan of G1 and want to see something entirely different (the characters are very different! Do not expect the Transformers characters to behave the same way they do in G1 or other series!), but with a similar goofy style, this series delivers. It also delivers a lot of hilarious one-liners and quotable lines, and also some surprising depth.

The action figure is not included, he just wanted to be in the photo.",1447459200,8,1745,4.565495207667731

6108619,4,B00GSTHDCU,"The actual box set is great, the series it self is nothing stellar but fairly enjoyable after the first disk. The hasbro toy connection is VERY prominent at times but it's a lot better than one mite expect for a series primarily created for it's toy series. The dialogue is also a bit ""kiddy""
but what do you expect. Good buy",1416441600,,325,4.344262295081967

6108734,3,B00GSTHDCU,"This is not a bad Transformers series but it's not a great series either, but it's overall plot is that as the war between the Autobots and Decepticons a third faction of human-sized Transformers called Mini-Cons that could link with the Autobots and The Decepticons and grant them more power and with 3 teams that could combine into a sword, shield, and rifle can tip the balance to one side or the other, The only problem is that the Mini-Cons make the bigger Transformers too powerful and Optimus Prime sends the Mini-Cons away from Cybertron but the Decepticons attack their ship and half of the ship crashes on the Moon and the other half in mountain on Earth. Millions of years later three kids Rad, Carlos, and Alexis discover the ship and reactivate the Mini-Cons and this sends a message to Cybertron so the Autobots and Decepticons arrive to collect as many of the Mini-Cons as they can, but the more Mini-Cons they find and use awaken a greater evil: Unicorn!

This more like ""The Transformers"" meets ""Pokemon"" the animation is not the best and there are a lot of mistakes with characters being called the wrong names. Alexis is OK, but Rad and Carlos are annoying as are the 2 stupid bullies (a Bulk and Skull rip-off from ""Power Rangers"") and the five at toward the end wear space-suits that homages to outfits wore by the heroes of the anime classic ""Battle For The Planets"".

Armada is no classic by any means but it's fun and it;s take on Starscream and his constant back-stabbing and betrayal of Megatron is different and refreshing. It's worth a look.",1408060800,,1569,4.6606498194945845

6108738,5,B00GSTHDCU,"This is the one series in the ""Unicron Trilogy"" that was always my favorite. Kudos to amazon.com for getting it to me so quick!! I ordered it Saturday, 8/2 and I had it in my hands today, 8/4!!!! Some of my favorite episodes in the show were ""carnival"", ""confrontation"", ""chase"", ""puppet"", ""drift"", ""cramp"", and ""origin"". So sad when starscream sacrificed himself. His minicon was left without a master. Overall, the series could make out to be a real crowd pleaser. One other thing I think they should've done was give it some special features. I use to watch this all the time when I was younger and it first came out to TV.",1407110400,,626,4.548672566371682
6108739,4,B00GSTHDCU,"I love the series but the actual DVDs are a pain in the neck. You can't pick which episodes to watch; theres just a Play all episodes option.

6108741,5,B00GSTHDCU,"I grew up on the original G1 Transformers and my 2 boys pretty much love everything Transformers as well, so when I saw they were re-releasing these episodes of the newer Armada show at a reasonable price, I had to buy it. My kids love it. This series is great, story lines can be a bit hokey I mean 3 kids helping huge robots with their war and not getting squished by accident is an interesting and a bit far fetched concept, but it is fun to watch. It keeps my boys entertained and since that is the key audience of these stories, that is all that really matters. I have not noticed any issues with my DVDs at all and we have watched them quite a few times already. So I would definitely say that it is an all round great product and would suggest it to anyone with young kids that love transformers or even if you like transformers and don't mind the tad bit odd storylines.",1402358400,,878,4.201183431952662

8626962,2,B00GSTHDCU,"This review is not in regards to the actual show which I had the full pleasure of experiencing as a child. This is about the condition of the cases holding my CD's.

Usually Amazon is very proficient about getting products to their future owners non-damaged, but I've been noticing a trend lately that I don't like. This is the second item that I've received from Amazon in a week that has been damaged. Now I understand that Amazon has a billion orders to fulfill a day, and not everyone of those orders can be perfect. Believe me, I get that, but if a trend is not corrected it becomes a pattern.

This trend first occurred when I ordered the Riddick collection and opened the case. Upon opening the case my CD's began sliding out. As an adult that takes care of his things, this is a huge no-no. I agreed to return Riddick for Transformers Armada. Now that I've received this, it too has a faulty case. Unfortunately this and Riddick will have to be returned. I love Amazon, but I can live without having my collectible DVD's and Blu Ray's damaged when they arrive.",1498176000,,1068,4.471794871794872
