1828579,3,B000087F1J,"Jon Hall stars as Dr. Tom Reynolds, or ""Ramar"" in this jungle  adventure series set in Africa and, later, India.  The series ran 52 episodes over a two year period from 1952 to 1954 and was broadcast well into the 1960s in syndication.  The stock scenes of wildlife were good, but didn't always mesh well with scenes set in obvious studio ""jungles.""  Besides Hall, also in the weekly cast were Ray Montgomery as Professor Howard Ogden and Nick Stewart as their native guide, Willy-Willy.  Look for Woody (billed as ""Woodrow"") Strode in two of the four episodes on this DVD.
Alpha Video's DVD presentation is reasonably good, considering the age of the broadcasts; video contrast is, for the most part, good and the audio is clear throughout all four episodes.  The show isn't great, but it's enjoyable enough on its own terms and will certainly bring back lots of memories for Baby Boomers and those who enjoy television from the early days.  Alpha has also released a second volume on DVD with an additional four episodes.  Episode titles on this first volume include ""Dark Venture,"" ""Voice of the Past,"" ""King of the Watus,"" and ""Lady of the Leopards.""
My rating is closer to *** & 1/2.",1066003200,36,1188,4.733009708737864

The DVD was great!

I once toured Jon Hall's house back in the 70's shortly after he'd committed suicide.

The house was bought by the late, great editor of Famous Monsters of Film land Magazine....",1400025600,,224,4.55

7979686,5,B000087F1J,"As a child, I loved the Ramar TV shows.  My friends & I would play Ramar of the Jungle instead of cowboys and indians.  These high quality videos brought back those memories.  As a child I was not aware that the animal scenes were inserted, but they are quite good.  I assumed they were shot on location in Africa.  I have now learned otherwise, but the shows are still great.",1297641600,4,376,4.314285714285714
