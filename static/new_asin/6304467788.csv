881811,5,6304467788,"Rowan Atkinson has proven his comic versatility once again. After leaping from perilous Black Adder to dumbfounded Mr. Bean, he has taken a new step towards comic genious. His portrayl of a snooty, over zealous constable is  superb and well worth the time. Unlike his other efforts, this series is  backed by a cast of persons able to step out of Atkinson's shadows and  easily provide a carnival of comic material. A must see for any fan of  Britcoms.",916531200,12,452,4.6835443037974684
882018,3,6304467788,"Great Disappointment for Butchered Set!

This is absolutely my favorite Rowan Atkinson series. Johnny English comes close but this is his most brilliant to me. Why? He plays the straight man to a dysfunctional police force that shares their office with an incompetent detective's squad. Hilarious material. So I naturally bought it when it became available. I had a set from China that had Chinese subtitles available. Yet this set offered special features. Imagine how shocked I was to find they had BUTCHERED the episodes. Whole scenes were missing and there is no clue as to why. Others have noticed this crude attempt at censorship as well. I suspect the Politically Correct Sensitivity Squad got their ham handed mits on them. Sad and tragic to feel the need to censor the works of others. Some of the missing bits were the funniest.
  Do yourself a favor and try to find the Chinese edition if you can. It is all there. I have noticed that even the episode that play on You Tube are missing those scenes. Wonderful show badly mishandled.",1457740800,2,1043,4.783333333333333

882022,5,6304467788,"The Thin Blue Line is, quite simply, a riot! Like many of the British comedies, the chief source of humor is the dialogue, so listen carefully!  Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the ""by the book"" Inspector Fowler - too bad he's as rigid and literal in his home (and sex) life as he is at the police station!  Each character is meticulously drawn and all are very well-acted - the incredibly inept Goody, Habib (a moder woman), Patricia, Fowler's co-worker as well as live-in girl friend (how does she put up with him?!)  And then there's Inspector Grim of the CID, who's ""hoity-toity, artsy-fartsy"" rants have you doubled up laughing while womdering (a) how can he do that with a straight face? and (b) how can he learn all that?

882587,5,6304467788,"I realize there is little point in reviewing an item that already has over 80 reviews posted on Amazon, but I know what I like!

It's true that the humor is a little bit slower to build and a little less cynical than your average 21st-century fare, but that doesn't mean this is a bad show. Be fair, this show is from 1995 and was not meant to be a biting societal commentary! If you appreciate scripting that is heavy on clever puns and the ""misunderstanding"" style of humor (for example, walking into a room when the conversation is halfway done and taking what's being said out of context, to HILARIOUS effect), this is just your cup of tea. The wind-ups can be slow, but they're usually just as rewarding when the punchline comes.

This was the first Rowan Atkinson-headed show I saw after ""Mr Bean"" and was initially fascinated just to hear his techniques and habits with a spoken role. Some of his uses of facial expressions are cousins or descendents of Mr. Bean's physical comedy, but this show mostly sticks to verbal humor. The entire cast is a generally good mix. Mina Anwar is the sassy but kind Maggie, who has a dozen feisty feminist comebacks at the ready but also has a habit of encouraging others to own up to mistakes and do the right thing. Rudolph Walker's deliciously out-of-touch Gladstone has a variety of exquisitely offbeat anecdotes whose deadpan delivery style will either send you howling or make you roll your eyes, depending on your point of view. James Dreyfus is the boyish, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly (because he's terrified of them) Kevin Goody, and David Haig is the endlessly exasperated Derek Grim (appropriately named, although he offers some of the biggest comic relief on the show). Supporting characters also include the long-suffering Pat Dawkins (courtesy of the charmingly plain Serena Evans) and Grim's goofball sidekicks Kray (Kevin Allen) and Boyle (Mark Addy).

Are the plots silly? Yes, but this is a silly show. I think it has an amazing ability to ""whiplash"" the mood around from sharp and serious to cute and cuddly in the span of 10 seconds. It does sometimes touch on real-world issues, but it's usually careful in how and where it treads.

I like to mention when a comedy is suitable for children, but for me, a content rating could be tricky to assign for this show. No nudity, big bloody violence, super-dark plots, or severe swearing (though they do say ""arse"" an awful lot), but there's a variety of not-so-subtle innuendo references. It's not as if anyone in the show gets a dildo for a Christmas present, but parents who want to shield their children from all references will need to pre-screen episodes and judge it for themselves. However, smart preteens could easily appreciate much of the humor in this show since a lot of it deals with benign wordplay. I'm accustomed to British English but found this show to be especially easy to follow in terms of jargon used (but you do need to know a bit about Brit pop culture).

P.S. - someone was complaining about cuts in episodes. This is true, there ARE some, but you will only notice if you caught the original U.K. broadcasts.",1376352000,,3132,4.728937728937729

Years passed and gave up hope of finding any more episodes.  I tripped over myself to order this DVD set.  The other reviewers noting the over-indulgence on sexuaized humor was indeed true.  It wears thin if you watch several episodes in a row.  I liked the first season better, but a TTBL addiction is not easily won over and rue that they ran out of material so quickly.  The repartee by this ensemble cast puts Atkinson in the best light along with the takes, double takes and double-meaning ""Are we on the same planet?"" type of dialogues.

882762,5,6304467788,"Rowan Atkinson has long been lauded in America for his performance as the hapless Mr Bean. This is just one of the many facets of his comedic genius.

In Britain, Mr Bean is dethroned by Atkinson's earlier character, Edmund Blackadder. Who, as many of you may know, is an entirely different character to Mr Bean.

I read many reviews of Mr Bean from the American public who find him hilarious and they often wonder ""What else has this Rowan Atkinson done in his career?""

And so they look at his IMDB and begin to pick out titles to buy or to rent. Inevitably Blackadder and The Thin Blue Line are on that list.

I therefore cannot understand how some who say they like Blackadder, say they do not like The Thin Blue Line.

As a major fan of both (And I reckon TBL could have lasted another 2 series, but as is the tradition of British comedy, it's almost always short and sweet) I can see the similarities in the various jokes that Ben Elton (who worked on both Blackadder and this) has put in. Making this series VERY funny.

Sadly though, it has languished in obscurity in the mind of the British public since the second series ended in 1996.

Atkinson has gone on to do the Bean movie and various other film roles but hasn't yet returned to a leading role on TV. Maybe someday he will.

This series had a great supporting cast too. James Dreyfus as Constable Goody, Mina Anwar as Constable Habib, Rudolph Walker as Constable Gladstone and David Haig as Fowler's CID Counterpart Detective Inspector Grim. The way the lines were delivered had you crying with laughter. Sheer Brilliance.

Grim: I've been liaising with some geezers from 'The Met'; pooling our intelligence.

Fowler: Goodness. Between you, you must have made an imbecile.",1299801600,3,1738,4.613636363636363
882763,4,6304467788,"In my younger days I used to watch Mr. Bean all the time and I would always see the preview of The Thin Blue Line.  I decided to finally pick it up and watch it (previously is had been a pain to find) and I must say I am shocked at how well this is put together!

What a great show!  If you love all types of comedy you will want to be sure to pick this up.  It is tasteful, witty, and all in all well-rounded.  This show must have had some awesome writers, and as always Rowan Atkinson is spectacular!  I would say typical British style humor, but its got a little more of an edge to it, just that extra bit of push.

I lauged a lot.  Someone who isn't a fan of the British scene or doesn't appreciate smart comedy probably wouldn't want to give it much of a chance.  There are words and phrases that are hard for Americans to understand, but they are potrayed in such a way that I still laughed (even though I had no clue what I was laughing at).  Great for the older mature crowd, I suggest picking this up.",1297123200,2,1010,4.005
882764,4,6304467788,"I purchased this series because I've enjoyed other works starring Atkinson, and the description sounded funny -- in other words, I had very little idea of what to expect. I was not disappointed. This is something like a modernized, diversified Black Adder-humor cop show. In other words, highly entertaining.

There is a fairly sizable cast of characters, most of whom are very good to excellent. The plots are varied, but generally nothing extraordinary (in either a negative or positive sense); the show relies more on the humorous interactions of characters, rather than the storyline of each episode, to foster enjoyment. That said, British humor, obviously, abounds, so, if that bores you, you probably won't like this; otherwise, you will likely enjoy it very much. This is not, imho, the best of British comedy; it is reminiscent of the Black Adder series in its puns, but, alas, the pupil does not outshine the master. One thing, I think, is that Atkinson is not reprising the role at which he most excels -- pseudo-villain. Aktinson's inspector is very good, but he is not the same caliber as the ""Black Vegetable"" -- not through a failing on the actor's part, but by the constraints of the script, which force him (as the part demands) to play a good guy, when he, as an actor, shines so as a villain. That is hardly a problem with either the plot or the acting, though -- just an observation on my part. :)

Also to be aware of, depending on the episode, there is a heavy reliance on sexual humor to draw laughs. Some episodes are better, some are worse, and sometimes this is funny, and sometimes it's not really.

All in all, I rate this a solid 4/5 stars, with some episodes eliciting side-splitting laughter, and others a quiet ""meh"".",1296259200,6,1749,4.727868852459016

David Haig, as the blustering criminal investigator, can dish up stuff that will cause those 'toity-hoity, cheese-eating, fancy-magazine-reading, skinny-milk-sipping-cream-of-the elete' (my attempt to demonstrate how he talks) to bust a gut laughing. Rowan Atkinson insists upon praising the importance of healthy bowels and upright British values even as his girlfriend is desperately complaining about lack of romance...well, sex.

He is up against the non-uniformed branch led by an egotistical airhead and his men including Mark Addy in some episodes. I love the first episode entitled Rag Week where college students pull pranks. The comedic lines were genius and so was the writing to make every episode as brilliant as the last. When a bank is held up, Raymond played by Rowan Atkinson believes it's another college prank. I forget the Asian-British actress who plays along but she's brilliant as is the funny guy who gets mistaken for a college student dressed up in uniform.

The ""thin blue line"" speeches of Inspector Fowler are so funny (ever had a Fisherman's Friend"") as he puts his foot in his mouth more with every word.  I like Constible Gladstone.  When he talks about how he put his foot down to his wife and then he owns up to the fact that after he told her how it was going to be he never saw her again cracks me up.  Inspector Grim has to be the dimmest bulb to ever put on a badge.  His strings of  descriptive adjectives is mind boggling and extremely funny if not bordering on cruel. For us Inspector Fowler fans who have watched Grim run down Fowler's obvious love of police work, tradition and his staff, we get our own back during the episode about Grim's son.  My personal all time favorite show is the Christmas show.

883062,5,6304467788,"A solid 4.5 stars.

Anything that Rowan Atkinson is in is hilarious. He always brings the best in comedy to any role he does. When I watch I can be laughing one minute and then I see a deeper & more profound part of his character. Rowan's character of Raymond Fowler is a byzantine one. One minute he is  the straight laced, nose to the grindstone police officer, then the next second he shows a side that can be more compassionate of the people and situations surrounding him. It doesn't help that he is surrounded by a gaggle of quirky and outlandish officers. The quirkiest of the gaggle is Officer Goody. I found Officer Goody's total quirkiness a great contrast to Rowan's straight-laced Officer Fowler. These two have many great scenes together and they work well. Constable Frank Gladstone (I believe played by Rudolph Walker) is a great character as well- very funny. Detective Inspector Derek Grim (David Haig) is hilarious too.

This show is a must see for the Rowan Atkinson fan. The reason I give this one 4.5 stars is because, to the American audience (such as myself)there are some comments I didn't get. There were references to certain persons, products or places that were funny to the British audiences, but I had no knowledge of. Other than that this a definite A+ in my book.

I'll close with one of my favorite quotes from the show:  We gave our dog a bad name... Colin. Terrible name! You have no idea how many people are called Colin. We'd go to the park - I'd shout, ""Come here, Colin!"", and fifteen people would turn around. Big people too, sir. I mean for some reason all the big lads get called Colin. I mean - I'd shout, ""Colin, you're a bad boy! I just saw you do a caca. And now, I'm going to rub your nose in it.""

Inspector Fowler who is in charge of a mottley crew of uniformed officers. All of the supporting cast playing Fowlers team are good.

However the reason to get this series is David Haig (who I have never seen in anythingelse) as Detective Inspector Grim. Although he doesn't get as much screen time as Atkinson when he is on-screen he is superb and steals the show from everybody.

Fowler is fiercely for the Queen, against injustice, and pretty much a well meaning but quiet fool.

Fowler is blindly naive to the needs of his girlfriend.

Atkinson is joined by a cast of plainclothes officers who are goofier than anyone could believe. Fowler's plainclothes counterpart has one of the best jibberish lines you've ever seen and worth listening to over and over.

883369,4,6304467788,"I am great fan of Rowan Atkinson and hold that his work on ""Blackadder"" is at the peak of British comedy. While I also like ""Mr. Bean,"" I was pleased but not overwhelmed by ""The Thin Blue Line."" The series does include some great moments, but is essentially a run of the mill ensemble sitcom with a very good cast, which in the extras Ben Elton reveals to be his exact intent. In that regard, because the series excels in what it set out to do, it's a success, it is just lacking some of the cleverness and quirk of ""Blackadder"" and ""Mr. Bean.""

Having said that, I do like the series. I marginally prefer the second series, and very much prefer Atkinson's moral lectures as an opening in place of the standard theme song (which is virtually impossible to get out of your mind) from the first season. I find the character of Inspector Raymond Fowler (Atkinson) to be greatly amusing in it's inflexibility. I think David Haig is an excellent supporting actor in his portrayal of the pompous Detective Inspector Grim whose mixed metaphors and euphemisms always get a laugh, while Rudolph Walker playing Police Constable Gladstone is my favorite supporting cast member as he comes up the most surreal comments on a given subject of the entire cast (watch especially for his impersonation of a tree in season two).

Overall the plots are fairly predictable and the cast all does great work, but in the end I decided on a four star rating (four and a half might realistically be closer) because even though it is extremely skillfully executed, and is a joy to watch, it really is a very conventional sitcom, which is a departure for the decidedly unconventional Elton and Atkinson. Note that the third disk contains a lot of interviews about the show, and focuses on Elton predominantly; the disc provides an interesting look into the inner workings of the mind of a modern comic genius.

883507,5,6304467788,"The police comedy is a difficult genre to manage. Inevitably, most shows/movies attempt to balance the serious social issues police must confront with comedy, but rarely is the balance successful. Certainly the dark dramas like Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue hit their niche, but movie franchises like ""Police Academy"" and series like the early 80s ""Carter Country"" quickly degenerated after the first instalment into silliness, and then stupidity.

But The Thin Blue Line forgets neither its comedic drive nor its serious source material. It's a very verbal comedy that preserves the occasional serious issue without becoming maudlin or polarized, like the old MASH series tended to be.

The show develops certain comedic patterns that, instead of becoming repetitive, are moments to which the viewer looks forward: Inspector Grim's increasingly lengthy litanies of insults starting with a riff on ""hoity-toity"", Kevin Goody's ridiculous physical comedy and almost liquid body motion in times of distress, Patricia Dawkins's constant sexual frustration, and so on.

Perhaps the show's greatest comedic triumph is the merging of Inspector Fowler's (Rowan Atkinson's) honest, if conservative and slightly out-moded social values, with the comedic conflicts his character experiences with other officers and characters. Fowler has a razor wit, and he honestly and strictly sticks to his values, even to the point that we might consider him too strict. It makes for misadventure, and yet it is genuine and credible. In the end, his British politeness and devotion to duty win out over violent, fire-armed courses of strong-arm action, and it's uplifting.

The characters are all likeable in their own ways. Even Inspector Grim, while annoying, is probably harmless enough to be forgiven. It is indeed a shame that only two seasons of The Thin Blue Line were made, and only seven episodes per season, at that. Alas, even Black Adder only survived four seasons. If anything, that's my biggest criticism of the show - the brevity of its run. Did it really warrant cancellation? Are the British that inundated with clever comedy that they can afford to dump this show?

If you can appreciate verbal humour, or ever like movies such as Atkinson's Johnny English, and certainly if you liked Black Adder, you can't go wrong with The Thin Blue Line.",1139270400,10,2339,5.24331550802139

Unique, potentially satire-rich milieu; strange but engaging characters; talented, comedic performers; semi-believable events; etc.  What we don't have is much in the way of humor.  This two-series program, which initially appeared on BBC TV in the mid 90's, attempts to be based on verbal humor.  Most attempts prove unsuccessful.  The result is mostly silly dialog and actors mugging it up trying to at least look funny.  Such a disaster is totally unexpected, since THE THIN BLUE LINE has the same star and one of the three same credited script writers (another writer was the star) that brought us BLACK ADDER (also from BBC TV) which is arguably the most hilarious TV series ever created.  You might call THE THIN BLUE LINE the MORIBUND GREY ADDER.  Not helping matters is the pervasive use of British slang, and an inane laugh track that often overlaps with repartees.  The sound level of the manufactured laughter is also boosted, perhaps as an act of desperation.  This obnoxious, mechanical contrivance frequently tramples on the rapid, back-and-forth wordplay killing many a riposte.  Video quality is not that great either.  The combination of mostly humorless dialog, a lot of slang, and an industrial-strength laugh machine makes it easy to see why there was never a third series.

Grim's right hand man in the 1st season (the dark haired guy with the unibrow) is much funnier than season two's guy (even though that heavy set guy ended up starring in a US sitcom). He just didn't get the lines and gags that the 1st season gave our unibrow actor.

Detective Grim provides an earthy contrast to Atkinson's zany brand of British pomposity, whose demeanor and facial expressions are priceless--but it is the marvelous writing which turns the characters of The Thin Blue Line into genuinely likable characters whose on-screen chemistry jells from the git-go.",1110153600,3,684,5.171171171171171
883642,4,6304467788,"I was discouraged from getting this set by a Scottish friend of mine who is a rabid fan of Black Adder.  He said, ""You watch 'The Thin Blue Line' and cry,"" implying that it's nowhere near as good as BA.  I'm glad to say he was mistaken!

""The Thin Blue Line"" is a fine BritCom.  Although nowhere near as sinister as ""Black Adder,"" the writing is still sharp and funny.  There is much more slapstick involved as well, making me feel it has more in common with ""Fawlty Towers,"" perhaps, than BA.

There are two big reasons that I enjoy this show so much.  First off, is the obvious choice of Rowan Atkinson.  It's hard to find fault with him in most things, and the the same is true here.  He does such a great job of playing the middle-aged, condescending Inspector Fowler.  The character is best described as the emobodiment of those people who anally correct others' spelling mistakes on internet message boards, and Atkinson plays him well, indeed!  He also comes off blissfully aloof.  When his girlfriend suggests they do something passionate after work, he suggests reading ""King Soloman's Mines!""

The second reason to watch this series is, without a doubt, James Dreyfus' performance as the figity, effeminate, Mars bar-loving Constable Goody.  He often gives Rowan a run for his money in several scenes.  His constant attempts to gain the affection of Constable Habib and his interactions with Inspector Fowler are hilarious.

The only real thing I can complain about is the swap out of Det. Insp. Grim's sidekick between series one and two.  Mark Addy's character is okay in series two, but the Det. Constable Cray was hilarious in the first series.  He didn't say much, but that was the point...he was just sort of a neanderthalish guy, but the delivery was quite funny.

I'm not giving this a full 5 stars simply because I am comparing it to truly untouchable stuff like ""Black Adder,"" but it's certainly a worthy addition to anyone's BritCom collection.  If you're a fan of British wit, Ben Elton or Rowan Atkinson, I highly recommend it!",1107561600,8,2050,4.737288135593221

Received this box set DVD for Christmas and it's another fine offering from the creative mind of Ben Elton.  An ensemble character study of a small town police force ruled over by puffy, stuffy Rowan Atkinson.  While his sneering Black Adder venom is considerably lowered, he still delivers his lines with his trademark resignation of the clods surrounding him.  What a crew they are, strangely endearing, particularly my favorite, the manic Inspector Grim, who always appears to be on the cusp of the big sting.  Both seasons are presented along w/ a third disc detailing Elton's career which was fun to see w/ Young Ones, Filthy Rich, Black Adder, and beyond.  Recommended.",1104537600,2,752,4.928571428571429
883646,5,6304467788,"Ben Elton's hilarious television series, ""The Thin Blue Line"" features some of the zaniest policeman to ever hit the British small screen. In this 1995-96 Brit-Com, we watch the comedic adventures of the oddball characters, who wear the uniform of the City of Gathforth's Police Department. The series stars the wonderful British TV comedian, Rowan Atkinson as the uptight and prudish Insector, Raymond C. Fowler. He is a man, who is  comically obsessive about following the rules and maintaining stiff upper lip, British decorum. While many might laugh at him and his old fashion values, it is his morality and sense of fairplay that often gets his officers out of the many jams they get into. The other officers include Sgt. Patricia Dawkins (Serena Evans), a middle age and often morose women, who happens to be Fowler's live-in girlfriend. She feels like life is passing her by, which isn't helped by the lack of 'action' in the couple's bedroom. Others include Const. Maggie Habib (Mina Anwar) a smart & pretty young female officer, who's precocious comments often land her in trouble, Const. Frank Gladstone (Rudolph Walker) an older distiguish looking officer, who's long & winding stories of his youth, often come to an almost comically pointless end. Finally, there is the hilarious, Cont. Kevin Goody (James Dreyfus), who's overly effeminate & flamboyant personality, would bring the viewer to the conclusion, that he was gay, if it wasn't for the fact that he is often romantically 'mooning' over Const. Habib. You would think, that city crime would be this zany group's biggest problem. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Instead their attention and problems are often from the same source C.I.D. (Criminal Investigations Division), who often do their detective jobs by cutting corners and bending or even breaking the law. They are lead by the obnoxiously macho, Det. Insp. Derek Grim (David Haig). He's a loud, ranting man, who's seen one too many ""Rambo"" movies and might actually be dangerous, if he had more than half a brain in his head. Unfortunately his ""bull in a china shop"" ways often causes trouble for poor Insp. Fowler and his officers. The comic writing on this show is brillaint. The scripts (from writer/creator Ben Elton) feature a mixture of great characters and sharp dialogue, that will leave you laughing out loud. The ensemble cast is superb. The comic genius of Rowan Atkinson (of ""Mr. Bean"" & ""Black Adder"" fame) once again creates a new wonderful charcter. His bug eyed, Insp. Fowler lovingly pokes fun at every stuffy, prude you have ever come across. Likwise, Serena Evan's Sgt. Dawkins is the comic picture of middle age crisis and sexual desperation. But it is James Dreyfus's rubber faced, Insp. Goody, who really steals every scene he's in. This guy could give legendary comic, Jerry Lewis a real run for his money, when it comes to protraying great slapstick humor! The series has now been released to the DVD format in a three disc box set titled, ""The Thin Blue Line - The Complete Line-Up"". This includes both Series 1 & 2 on the first two discs. The third disc includes a documentary on series co-creator/writer, Ben Elton as well as interviews & trailers. ""The Thin Blue Line"" is a wonderful comedy, which will leave you holding your sides from too much laughter. A great British comedy! Highly recommended!",1103673600,7,3359,4.966252220248668
883647,3,6304467788,"The reason I give this three stars is not due to the quality of the show. That's easily five stars. To learn more about the show, please read some of the other reviews. My review (and my only complaint with this dvd set) is based on the startling omissions present on the dvd set!

My wife and I purchased season 1 and 2 on VHS about 4 years ago and we've nearly watched those tapes to the breaking point. When we saw that the dvd set was coming out, it went to the top of our Christmas list. Well, we couldn't wait until Christmas to watch it and after a few episodes, we began to feel very disappointed and more than just a bit cheated! In two episodes (that we've noticed so far) there are scenes missing on the dvd!

In Alternative Culture, Sgt. Dawkins asks Raymond to pick her up from her 're-birthing' class later that evening. Well, the dvd is missing the scene where she has her re-birth and Raymond is waiting for her with a bottle!

In The Green-Eyed Monster there is a scene outside the club where Boyle and Goody use their badges to gain entrance to the club and Raymond, rather than go against his ethics, says behind to wait in line. Yet again, this did not appear on the dvd.

Based on the fact that we watched two episodes and BOTH were missing scenes one can only imagine that there will be others.

If you've never seen The Thin Blue Line, you won't miss them. If, on the otherhand, you're a longtime fan, this is just frustrating (sort of like buying the Complete Mr. Bean dvd set only to find out there are scenes missing!).

So be forewarned! The Thin Blue Line 'The Complete Line-Up', as we shall see, is like a half-sucked sweet; Not what it used to be!",1103328000,128,1677,4.291139240506329
883648,5,6304467788,"An excellent ensemble round out this programme.  Habib, Goody, Sgt. Darling, uh uh Dawkins and the sarcastic centerpiece Inspector Fowler.  Atkinson's own special brand of sarcasm is here in good measure, although with not quite as hard an edge as in the Blackadder series.  I had never heard of this and bought when I saw the positive responses.  It is now among my favorites.  I don't really see how anyone who liked Mr Bean and Blackadder would not like this dvd set.  Buy it and enjoy and remember if my rear end is on the line, I don't want to be up to my neck in it.",1099353600,4,572,4.299065420560748
883649,5,6304467788,"British humor is usually either madly brilliant or badly gone wrong, there is never in-betweens.  The thin blue line is in fact, beyond brilliant.",1095638400,8,146,5.083333333333333
883650,5,6304467788,"Contained herein is the complete ""line-up"", the full series of Ben Elton's The Thin Blue Line in another essential DVD set from BBC video!  The first 2 discs include the 14 episodes that make up series 1 & 2 (Nov 1995-Dec 1996) and the 3rd disc includes over an hour of documentary and interview footage of creator/writer Ben Elton.  Elton is best known for his work on Black Adder and the Young Ones.  Both of these are essential DVD sets in your Britcom library and TBL is another must own.

The brilliant Rowan Atkinson heads the cast as the ""excessively"" riggid and by the book (which includes his personal life!), Inspector Fowler, who prefers his constables are as he is ""Keen of eye, swift of thought, and regular of bowel"". Rowan's performance here is most similar to his character in the Black Adder as far as dialogue goes so if you like that series you'll more than likely love this.  The Thin Blue Line, like Black Adder, is a dialogue driven show and Ben Elton uses every chance he can to let the characters (especially Fowler and Det. Inspetor Grim) go off into hilariously wordy tangents.  The show is filled with unique characters, each funny in their own right:  Sgt. Patricia Dawkins (Fowler's girlfriend of 10 years!), Constables: Habib, Gladstone, and Goody, Det. Constable Kray (Series 1), Det. Constable Boyle (Series 2), and of course the endlessly bafoonish Det. Inspector Derek Grim of CID.  The show is mostly based in the police station and occasionally in the field or at Fowler & Dawkins' flat.  I fell in love with the show from renting the one lone VHS tape a local video store carried which only contained two episodes.  Those episodes were well played believe me, so seeing this released was quite exciting.  It also completed my Rowan Atkinson DVD trilogy (Black Adder, Mr. Bean, & TBL)! Here's the contents:

Disc One: Series 1

01. Rag Week

02. The Queen's Birthday Present

03. Night Shift

04. Honey Trap

05. Fire & Terror

06. Kids Today

07. Yuletide Spirit

Disc Two: Series 2

08. Court in the act

09. Ism Ism Ism

10. Fly on the wall

11. Alternative Culture

13. Road Rage

14. The Green Eyed Monster

Disc Three: Extras - ""Best of British: Ben Elton"" (45 minute documentary), ""Smillie's People: Ben Elton""(15 minute interview), TBL Cast Bios, & trailers

Trivia:

*In the first series, Grim's right hand man Kray is played by Kevin Allen.  In series 2 the character is replaced by Boyle (Mark Addy).  You may recognize Addy from ""The Full Monty"" or from the U.S. sitcom ""Still Standing"" where he's married to Jamie Gertz and has a son and daughter.  Addy uses an american accent on the show, but once in a while you can hear his british one come through.

*Police Constable Gladstone is played with perfection by Rudolph Walker.  Mr. Bean fans may remember Walker from his small role in the first episode where he is the exam giver.

*David Haig (Det. Inspector Grim) also worked with Rowan in the popular British film ""Four Weddings in a Funeral"" where Rowan plays the nervous and fumbling Father Gerald who presides over his wedding.  Haig plays ""Bernard St. John Delaney"".  Priceless scene.

I can't complete this review without a few quotes.  Here are three favorites from the man, Inspector Grim:

""Goody-goody, lotti-dotti, namby-hoity, wishy-pamby, toity-washy, dotti-lotti, know it all, public school, stiff upper lip, stiff upper house master, prim & proper, rule brittania...uhh!""

""When you run us up the flag pole, you'll find you're saluting a very different kettle of fish.""

883651,5,6304467788,"This British series starring the ever talented Rowan Atkinson is very funny.  The cast of characters all blend well to make a very enjoyable sitcom.  If you are a Rowan Atkinson fan then I recommend this series over Black Adder.  I can relate better to this modern genre more so than the Black Adder ""period piece"".

883771,5,6304467788,"Just to let you know where I'm coming from, my taste in British Comedies lean toward those with A LOT of ""in your face"" sarcastic and/or vindictive wit such as Black Adder, Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers, The Young Ones and Monty Python.  With the exception of Seinfeld, I don't know of any other American comedy that has even come close to these for pure ""laugh"" value.

If you like any of the aforementioned britcoms, I highly recommend The Thin Blue Line.  Granted the story lines are not as unique (after all, it's a police station) but the witty insults are unrelenting and the range, contrast and chemistry between a great set of unique characters makes this (IMO) a classic.  Chief among these is Inspector Grim - a Kojak wanna-be who believes the entire population should be born in prison, lives to take off his shirt while wearing his shoulder holster and who would ""just once in a while like to knick a criminal whose balls have dropped"".",1093305600,25,943,4.62874251497006

I know that Americans and Brits supposedly speak the same language, but for this one I think I need a British to American dictionary. (Do they make those? If not, they should.)

They have never been within the limits of anything in the world and they dare exhibit pure, intense and dense bigotry that is supposed to make you laugh. At times it is funny. Ah! Ah! or Strange? I cant say. In other words hilarious humorous Brexit fifteen years ago. Advanced, aint they?

We are within a police station in Gasford, or something like that, in London and it is the population of this police station that is at stake. Rowan Atkinson is the boss and he is a grimacing, twitchy old hetero (though not sexual) male chauvinist pig, and he deserves this animal personification, though the animal does not deserve the police-gentrification of that character. Ex-married with a grown up student-son or son-student whose only part we see is his bottom in his underwear  quite a limited vision though slightly too chubby, or is it wrapped up or fat, for 20 or so  this police chief lives with a girlfriend who is more satisfied by her dog than by her boyfriend. Interesting! The old spinster revisited here as an old neglected unmarried home-feature piece of human furniture. She should try the plumber, strangely absent in this series.

Then you have a constable who is openly heterosexual lusting on his female Asian colleague and behaving like a gay clich strutting around in all kinds of supposedly homosexual antics. Openly anti-gay in its humorous covering of extreme behavior that even children under five would consider slightly off the point and unacceptable. Certainly not funny!

Then you have another one who is black because you need to have a black man on a series, but he is also a male chauvinist pig in his own way with crazy stories at times about his wife and how he ordered her around till he was led to submit to her authority which meant more or less putting herself and him at a mutual shared distance. Then you can add in the same line the female Asian constable who is supposed to bring some feminine sexy charm in this comedy and of course the necessary Asian coloration for the series to be racially correct.

Add to these the girlfriend of the boss. She is at the desk all the time, or nearly, since she must be a sergeant or something like that. But the CID (is it Crime Investigating Department?) of this police station is a pair of fat slobs pretending to be male and masculine and sports-like and beer-guzzling and farting all the time and burping in-between farts and of course testicular male chauvinist hogs, not to overuse pigs.

The main charm though is none of these caricatures. It is the delirium linguistica of some if not all the characters. They speak in a lingua  not franca at all  that has nothing to do with standard civilized English, certainly not the Queens type. It is a completely revisited cockney reinvention based on accumulation of words that mean nothing really except that they play on echoing sounds and gross, frankly at times sickening, innuendo and implied meaning though they have little meaning per se. If you want it could be qualified as cop-minded wife-beating universally-incorrect white-shaded cockney-colored gangster rap, at least if cops can use gangster slang.

You might find it funny at times though it is more sickeningly exuberant and closer to the Tourette scatological syndrome than to any sane discursive expression.
