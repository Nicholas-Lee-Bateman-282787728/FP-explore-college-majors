8486387,3,B005TMXY9S,This 1960 low budget movie is narrated and scripted in a way which reminds me of a television program from the 1950's - 1960's.  It begins with an assassination committed with silencer equipped revolvers.  Maybe the people making the old movies didn't want to reveal how silencers actually work as this combination of revolvers and silencers was quite common.  The plot device of the assassins taking over a home from which to shoot was used to better effect in the 1954 movie SUDDENLY staring Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden.,1447027200,,528,4.910112359550562

8486390,4,B005TMXY9S,"Tiny budgeted hood saga starring the always wonderful Cameron Mitchell. Plus usually a blue collar good guy Steve Brodie. As his triggerman pal. A tough and tight 'b' with excellent performances. Mainly of course from the leads. Cool suits,sharp lids,classic cars,hip dialogue - what's not to like. Note the still on the dvd case. Is I am pretty damn sure. From another film from this company.'Inside The Mafia' which I would now like to buy too.",1374710400,,446,4.881578947368421
