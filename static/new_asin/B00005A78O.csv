1411920,5,B00005A78O,"This is a very well sculpted performance of this opera.  Thielmann and the MET Orchestra give a great reading of the score.  All aspects of this densely orchestrated piece are defined and carefully articulated.  Wonderful character is maintained throughout the body of work by Thielmann's vision.  I think that a problem most conductors have with Richard Strauss (Not to Mention Mahler as well) is that they take the music too seriously!  Strauss is very passionate and beautiful...  But he has a very characteristic light and comical side as well.  Arabella is a perfect example of this...  It's a beautiful love story and plays out with a lot of humor.  Not just in the story, but in the music as well.  Thielmann does a great job in finding that balance of emotion and being consistent with it throughout the opera.  Kiri Te Kanawa gives a fantastic performance as Arabella and the supporting cast is divine.  Marie McGlaughlin gives a slightly forced but, gorgeous Zdenka.  Donald McIntyre, who I know from his role as Wotan in Wagner's Ring Cycle, conducted by Piere Boulez, is a great Graf Waldner.  Natalie Dessay is so cute and so amazingly talented that she almost steals the show in the second act!  Wolfgang Brendel and David Kuebler play the two strong male roles of Mandryka and Matteo respectively.  Their vocal and acting performances are powerful and fun.  The costumes are convincing and the sets are very detailed which helps establish the stage action perfectly.  I can't say anything bad about it...  Strongly recommended.",1165190400,16,1542,4.953125
1411921,5,B00005A78O,"Great to read Amazon's own review of this dvd Arabella! When you join melodious Strauss with Kiri Te Kanawa and the Met orchestra you have vintage vocal and instrumental tone along with a  timber of sheer beauty. Granted Strauss may not everybody's forte but this performance deserves at least a hearing. The only objection I have is that Arabella refers to herself as  waiting for the right man; I like to think that she's looking for the right person not waiting for that white horse and dowdy prince. Add the rest of this wonderful cast and Thielemann in the pit and you have wondrous  music making. Fiakermilli is a silly role but Dessay makes it thrilling. At least she doesn't come running on the stage in disheveled clothing looking  for an ax or wearing almost nothing demanding somebody's  head. Putting silly aside this is a great Met release. The Arabella-Zdenka duet in Act one is beautifully sung; the Mandryka - Arabella duet in Act three is extremely beautiful and the closing monologue is deeply moving.  Don't pass it up. It forms a great trio with Ariadne and Rosenkavalier, if not totally in their class.",1140652800,15,1123,4.762886597938144
1411922,5,B00005A78O,"The strikingly beautiful daughter of a count, Arabella finds herself under immediate pressure to marry one of her three ardent admirers. Or, will she marry a young officer that her younger sister loves, or the extremely wealthy new stranger in town?

Not only does this performance bring you the typical heart-wrenching emotion of a Strauss opera, but also a story line that keeps you wanting to see what will happen next.

It seems everyone raves about Kiri Te Kanawa's affinity for Strauss. But it's true. I think Strauss would be pleased with the singing, personality, and presence that Kiri gives his leading lady.

The rest of the cast is equally well-suited. Wolfgang Brendel is an energetic prince as Mandryka. Donald McIntyre gives depth to Arabella's conniving, gambling-addicted father. Marie McLaughlin turns in an exemplary trouser-role, as Arabella's brother, and where but in opera could we mistake her for a man?

If you can let yourself go in a romantic vein, you will enjoy Arabella for its beautiful singing and acting, as it tells a Cinderella story.",1115337600,7,1069,5.056818181818182
1411923,5,B00005A78O,I thought the production beautiful and the singing excellent.  Kiri is a bit aloof as she is always but Wolfgang makes up for it.  He is just scrumptous and the perfect leading man with some chemistry between them.  All the parts have excellent casting and performances are very good to excellent.  The conducting kept the pace very interesting.  This is a keeper and I'm not a big Strauss fan!  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good love story!,1084492800,7,458,4.592592592592593
1411924,5,B00005A78O,"First rate cast, all singing supurbly. Beautiful production. Kiri is spectacular, Brendel is fine as a romantic lead. McIntyre is particularly  fine as the father.",1061424000,7,163,5.52
1411925,5,B00005A78O,"How lucky we are to have this gorgeous Metropolitan Opera production on such a high-quality DVD! If you missed the original 1995 telecast of this opera, you have yet to discover the joys of this production. Arabella is a comedy of manners set in 1860s Vienna. Arabella's parents have a fading fortune, so they can afford to marry off only one of their two daughters; the other, Zdenka, they dress as a boy and refer to as Zdenke. I won't give away the rest of the story; it's really worth it to let this magnificent performance unfold and find out what happens that way. The cast was the best that could possibly be assembled at the time, with Wolfgang Brendel, quite convincing as the young, hot-blooded Mandryka, in his debut of the role. Kiri Te Kanawa is a legendary Strauss singer, and though she is often criticized for poor interpretation, in this opera her subtle acting shines. For example, look at her reaction when she meets Mandryka, the man she had been crushing on witho! ut knowing who he was. Her singing is consistently beautiful and soft, and her stage presence is radiant, in spite of her fifty years at the time of this taping. Arabella is supposed to be about twenty years old, and Kiri truly exudes the youth of the character, yet manages to convey the maturity that colors her almost maternal relationship with her younger sister Zdenka. Helga Dernesch and Donald McIntyre are animated as Arabella's parents. Marie McLaughlin is a passionate Zdenka. We really feel for her throughout the opera, as she longs for femininity and love. A special bonus in this production is the now-stellar Nathalie Dessay as Die Fiakermilli. She flaunts her coloratura in Act II. Christinan Thielemann is a sensitive conductor, and the MET orchestra plays flawlessly. The DVD transfer is superb. Subtitles available in German (original language), French, English, and Chinese. (Special note: Rene Fleming will perform in this same production at the MET in November 2001. G!et your tickets!)",993859200,57,1994,4.902366863905326
1411961,4,B00005A78O,"""Arabella"" is essentially theater dressed up with operatic music -- showing that Richard Strauss (and Hugo von Hofmannsthal) could reverse the ""Prima la musica, poi le parole"" dictum when they wanted.

In this case, the theater seems to play to fantasies of vanity, intrigue, and romance that in other places would qualify as chick lit.

As usual for Strauss's operas however, ""Arabella"" contains a variety of strong, modern psychological characterizations, a nearly unique attribute that combined with Strauss's music makes Strauss's body of operas so much more interesting than many other popular pieces in the genre.

The performance and recording on this DVD are exemplary, even though the material is inherently not at the level of the masterpieces that Strauss produced so often.",1306627200,,785,5.365853658536586
1411962,5,B00005A78O,Superb cast. Great story and libretto. Fine production. Top notch audio.  And as a bonus it does not end in tragedy like many operas. Highly recommended.,1300924800,,153,4.884615384615385
1411963,5,B00005A78O,"I was never a big fan of ""Arabella"" until I saw and heard this DVD. It is now one of my favorites. The work itself has its share of padding and over orchestration at times (as with so much of Strauss) but,oh,the high points are
absolutely incredible. Listen to the Duet between Arabella and her sister in Act I, the duet with Mandryka at the beginning of Act II and the breathtaking end of Act III. Short of the heavenly choirs you are not going to hear such singing.
Dame Kiri is wonderful! She looks great and really gets into this role. She was born to do this. The fact that she was 50 when this was made makes this all the more astonishing. All the parts are filled to perfection. It is hard to believe this was Wolfgang Brendel's first outing in this part. He enjoys himself immensely, sounds wonderful and also looks exactly right. The obvious affinity these two have for each others artistry makes for a wonderful chemistry in their scenes together right down to the endearing buss on both cheeks Brendel gives her spontaneously
during the thunderous ovation for their first curtain call.

All the other singers are great, inhabit their parts wonderfully and are fully at home in the Strauss idiom.
The production is gorgeous down to the last detail. To top it all off the Met Orchestra play their hearts out for
Maestro Thielemann who has a way with this music and (as much as is humanly possible) keeps a wonderful balance
between pit and stage. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD.",1272067200,,1492,4.588014981273409
1411964,5,B00005A78O,"This is a wonderful production, superbly directed, sung, acted and filmed. One might nit pick here and there but I'm not a nit picker. Everyone is so perfect in their individual roles, so rightly cast. The acting all around is terrific and just as rich in close ups as from a distance. This is very demanding vocal music that requires extraodinary abilities of the supporting players and they all deliver no matter how small the role. Gorgeously costumed and set in the 1860's, the ladies gowns can be somewhat cumbersome. A rare opera where no one dies although a duel is barely avoided a happy ending ensues joyfully expressed by Mandryka's ecstatic skips as the final curtain descends. Only the very difficult will be disappointed but for those of us who don't know too much, it's a pleasure. Very highly recommended.",1231891200,5,820,4.822695035460993
1411965,5,B00005A78O,"i've never seen so many big names in one opera before ; also, nathalie dessay has a little role in act II, but that's not really highlighted ; it's definitely a must-have for anyone who wants 2 hours of not stop beautiful music",1213660800,3,227,4.3023255813953485
1411966,5,B00005A78O,"Earlier criticism of Strauss was that he was washed up after his earlier operatic successes. Fortunately all post WWII performances of the later works have proved this silly generalization wrong. Arabella is a case in point. I suppose for non-German speaking auditors the arioso/recitative style that is common to much the later Strauss is perhaps the greatest hurtle to overcome. And the rewards are many for those that stick with this score.

This performance is superb. Te Kanawa is in lustrous voice and Brendel is excellent, but then I find no weak link in the cast. Many have criticized Kiri's German and I understand that she has admitted to finding the text of German operas somewhat daunting. (A pity that she didn't spend a year or two in a German house.) I have not seen/heard the Janowitz version and am reluctant because it is a film and lipsynching alienating. Additionally the German  diva has been guilty of being more interested in the tone and textually she has received some low marks, notably for her Elsa. So for me there is no choice. A great live performance conducted by one of the best German conductors or Solti whose recording of the opera is brutal.

Incidentally one of the previous reviewer states that there are no subtitles. This is not true. He needs to look at the back page of the notes provided. It is necessary to ""hit"" menu and the data is provided. Newer DGG releases have formatted their DVD's.",1212278400,3,1434,4.751004016064257
1411967,4,B00005A78O,"I've tried to get a copy of this production and been disappointed by everything from poor quality tapes to outright bootlegs of miserable quality.  Happily, an official DVD release is on its way from Decca/Universal. Here's the webpage:

[...]

""A formidable cast conducted by one of the supreme Strauss interpreters, Sir Georg Solti. The only film version available of Strauss's late operatic masterpiece. The only film version available of this opera, the celebrated director Otto Schenk's intimate film of Strauss's comedy of manners, set in mid-19th century Vienna. Schenk's beautiful staging uses traditional sets and costumes, making this a classic, historic and faithful account. Outstanding singing from a starry and unrivalled cast, including Gundula Janowitz, Edita Gruberova, Bernd Weikl and Rene Kollo. Sir Georg Solti, acknowledged as one of the greatest Strauss conductors, leads the Wiener Philharmoniker, making this one of the finest cast of Strauss performers available on either CD or DVD. Previously on Decca LD and VHS.""

Tower.com is already taking pre-orders and I hope Amazon will follow suit.  So, you can forget about having to settle for weak/chewed-up VHS transfers - the DVD is on its way (or already out as you read this).",1204329600,,1252,5.33502538071066
1411968,5,B00005A78O,"I was unfamiliar with the story of this opera until I saw it awhile back.  It's quite an amusing little story.  Te Kanawa looks the part of Arabella (even though she is over 50 in this performance), and she sings it with proper emotion. I don't understand people who say she sings without feeling.  The rest of the cast is top notch.  One of the perks of this recording is debut role of Natalie Dessay as the Fiakermilli.",1201910400,3,421,4.358974358974359

7935031,5,B00005A78O,I have had this for years. My tendancy has been to compare Mandryka to Dietrich  Fischer-Disksu and Arabella to Lisa Della Casa due to them both being favorites. But this cast and presentation is in all ways equal or superior the the LP/cd incarnations previously mentioned.  And David Kuebler's Matteo is extremely difficult to sing. His vocal acrobatics are golden toned and spit-on lovely to hear. What an accomplishment! Beautifully gorgeous singing by all. Marie McLaughlin is so perfect. You really will watch this numerous times. The sound is like a high quality cd. I clean house to it. No harm in memorizing a great opera!,1468627200,,631,4.943396226415095

 This is a traditionally staged and properly costumed rendition, with excellent singing. While I expected same, from Te Kanawa and Brendel, I was surprised that such an excellent voice, as that found in the form of Marie McLaughlin, was assigned to such a second-level part as Zdanka, Arabellas younger sister.
