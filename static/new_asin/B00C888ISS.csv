8578618,5,B00C888ISS,"I purchased this dvd for my son for christmas. I love the Arthur show and I love this message. My son is 4 and will be starting kindergarten next year, I know as a teacher that it is never too early to start teaching shildren about bullys. I don't want my child to be bullied or to become a bully himself. Children need to learn about these things to help them in developing a sense of what is right and what is wrong.

The Arthur series does a great job of teaching the lessons that kids need in a fun way that they can understand and relate to. I remember watching Arthur as a child on PBS when I would come home from school and I am glad that it is still around and that I was able to find this dvd to be able to share this with my child. My 10 year old daughter also loves Arthur and although she would not be very happy with me sharing that because she is too cool for that now I am glad that she was able to see this too. Even as a too cool 10 year old this is a good lesson for her too.

I love that PBS produces such wonderful shows with such great messages. I wish more kids were shown shows with messages like these instead of some of the other junk I see children watching. As a middle school teacher I see all sorts of kids and I really wish some of them had been shown things like this at a younger age when they were the most impressionable. I think it really can make a difference in childrens lives.

If you loved Arthur as a child or you really want to teach your children a great message you should buy this dvd and watch it with your children. This world could use a lot less bullying.",1456358400,2,1604,3.9751552795031055
