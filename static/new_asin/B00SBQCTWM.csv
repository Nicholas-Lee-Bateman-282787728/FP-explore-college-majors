8697996,4,B00SBQCTWM,"Nice slow yang forms, only single fan applications. It shows some possible combat applications with the fan moves.  Shows back and front views.  My only complaint is that you really can't show it on a US DVD player, only a computer.  I ended up ripping it with some software so that I could put the parts I wanted to focus on learning on the hard drive of my laptop. That works well.",1513123200,,383,4.291666666666667
8697997,5,B00SBQCTWM,I think this is a well-crafted instructional dvd and have enjoyed learning this form.  I only wish there were more done by her.  Thanls.,1510876800,,136,4.625
8697998,1,B00SBQCTWM,If I could give it less then one star I would do it. This video is horrible. They just blow right through the lesson no actual detail to how to perform them. We watched a bunch of videos on yang fan style and compared it to what she is doing in the video and what she is doing looks nothing like the yang form fan style. This is a complete rip off.,1491350400,,348,3.8472222222222223
8697999,5,B00SBQCTWM,"This would not play on my DVD player; however, it does play on my computer. The form is very easy to follow and each movement of the form is demonstrated individually. The audio is in a foreign language, but you can choose English for reading. The names of each movement are listed in order which is very helpful. I like this, because it is different from the other forms I have seen and  done in the Yang form.",1480723200,2,411,4.269230769230769
