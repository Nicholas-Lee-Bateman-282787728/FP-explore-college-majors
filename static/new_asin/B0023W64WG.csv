3842572,5,B0023W64WG,Every American who enjoys sitting down to a good meal should read this book and become educated about what happens to so many animals raised on the large factory farms in our country. We have the responsibility to know these facts.,1267315200,6,231,4.658536585365853
3842573,5,B0023W64WG,This movie really tells the story of where our meat comes from and how it is processed. Animal cruelity is what it is all about in order for humans to get their supply of fresh meat. To bad our politicians are all paid off and allow this horrific abuse to continue. I give hope to the individuals that support the end to this abuse of animals. God bless them!,1257897600,8,359,4.217391304347826
3842574,4,B0023W64WG,"What goes on behind the scenes in the industry that puts meat on our dining tables is almost too horrendous to describe.  This documentary not only lets us peek inside these factory-farms (in reality, house of horrors), but shows how difficult it is to do anything about it.  Only an outraged public, en masse, will put a stop to these dreadful practices.

If I were seen by a neighbor treating a pet dog, cat or horse the way millions upon millions of pigs and chickens are treated every day in America, I'd have gone to jail alongside footballer Michael Vick.",1257033600,9,561,4.59
3842575,5,B0023W64WG,"Most people don't know where the meat they eat comes from -- but they should.

Watch this film and see how pigs are treated in agribusiness. And then go vegetarian or vegan.

You can read my review of this film on my blog:

3842576,5,B0023W64WG,"This video documents the horrific abuse that routinely occurs on factory farms in America.  This is not a piece of propaganda, but a revealing documentary.  Watch it and decide for yourself whether you can justify our current practices.",1251590400,13,236,5.184210526315789
3842577,5,B0023W64WG,This is a fantastic film!  It makes people aware about what takes place behind the closed doors of America's factory farms.  Kudos to the Humane Farming Association for getting the animal abusers prosecuted.,1248652800,15,207,5.242424242424242
3842578,5,B0023W64WG,"This video exposed all that is wrong with today's factory farms. No one would believe that in this day and age, factory farmers would be lynching their disabled animals, but that's exactly what took place at Wiles Farm in Ohio.  I'm sure this isn't the only factory where such abuse is rampant.  Really opened my eyes.  Thanks to the Humane Farming Association and ""Pete"", the undercover investigator, for prompting this excellent documentary about what really takes place inside the pork industry.",1248393600,18,498,5.1234567901234565
3842579,1,B0023W64WG,Terrible perspective of hog farming.  This director should be ashamed of themselves.  The vast majority of hog farms are the exact opposite of the way they are portrayed in this video.  I grew up on a hog farm and have spent countless hours helping my father do pig chores.  I cant believe people actually buy into this BS.. This is not the way typical hog farms treat their animals.,1447718400,,383,4.507246376811594
3842580,5,B0023W64WG,Very interesting yet very sad documentary about the treatment of sows on this mans farm.  He and his son and some of the employees clearly were abusing these animals. :(,1446076800,2,169,4.633333333333334

3842584,5,B0023W64WG,"this is not a PETA flick,..., we as Human have the responsibility to be Human in our management of pain to any animal we EAT.  I live by the 7 Laws of Noah,..., and the Human race has failed miserably in this responsibility.",1436054400,5,224,4.209302325581396
3842585,5,B0023W64WG,"Those pigs are tortured the second they come into the world until the horrific end of their lives.  I hardly eat any meat but when I do I get it from an omish farm that believes that animals come from God and should be respected. You would not believe the difference in taste from an animal scared, tortured and stuck in a cage 24/7 it's whole life vs an animal given free range of land and a species appropriate diet.
The men working and running the farm are the most disgusting human beings I've ever seen.
That factory farm and every single one like it will never change their practices. It's up to us to make the change with our money and only buy meat from farms that treat their animals with respect.",1424304000,,706,4.30827067669173
3842586,5,B0023W64WG,"I was raised on a beautiful small horse farm. Everybody loves looking at our horses, and we have baby horses, and everybody thinks that horses are beautiful. They are. But I have seen stuff that haunts my mind! I really, really think that people should get involved in the humane training of horses. I haven't seen a horse ""broke"" to be ridden. I haven't seen a horse castrated of his testicles but it happens, constantly, in horse stables, without anasthetic. It is standard procedure for most young male horses, very few are left to be stallions. And I would imagine that stallions are really abused! Horses are whipped! Start looking at pictures of horses. There is always a whip. The whole time a horse is being raced, he is being hit with a whip. But I'm sure that the behind the scenes, not public ""training"" can be unimaginably cruel. I just want to tell the world this and I pray that horses become treated kindly. We are all God's creatures. If you can help animals and, especially, horses, please do!!!!!!!!!!!",1363651200,2,1020,4.6722222222222225
3842587,5,B0023W64WG,"finally this dvd exposes how america kills their a animals and tortures, anyone who believes in god or not should care about this murder!!! where are all the protests to shut down these farms? if you eat meat you should be charged with murder!!!",1288051200,2,245,4.590909090909091
3842588,5,B0023W64WG,"This should be shown in every school classroom.  Everyone should be aware of how their food comes to be.  Animals give their life for humans to exist and we treat them with such callous actions.  They should be treated as well as humans.  Animals have feelings and they feel physical pain.  It showed the reality of where our food comes from and the cruelty that is allowed to be done to creatures who have no choice as to their place in the food chain.  To take an animal just born and slam it on the ground because of whatever reason is not acceptable.  If humans were on the receiving end, which we ought to be, it would be a betrayal to us.  The investigator who went undercover several times is to be applauded for bringing real footage of the torture being inflicted on defenseless animals.  Whether they are lower on the food chain or not, they deserve respect.",1269302400,14,868,4.443037974683544
8350089,2,B0023W64WG,"As a movie I wasn't a fan of this film. It could have done with more production value. For example, hire a narrator.  Don't put text on a screen, I'm watching a movie so that I can hear and see a film. Not so I can read.

As for the subject matter I'm torn on the subject. It is cruelty to animals because the animals die. But at the same time these animals are being slaughtered to fulfill the public's needs. Had these pigs been killed just for leisure then I'd completely agree it's cruelty.  At the beginning of the film ""Pete"" compares the way pigs are moved along to a traffic jam. He used the term traffic jam, that is a term we use for human beings. So is he saying humans are cruelly treated on a daily basis? Or is he saying the pigs were treated well?",1523664000,,762,4.100671140939597
8350090,3,B0023W64WG,"In a nut shell, laws exist however prosecutors refuse to take cases and the USDA, like the FBI when it comes to the orlando shooter, fail to do their jobs and the AUSA's refuse to accept cases for prosecution on a federal level.  They all take easy cases but no-one wants to to the hard work.

Reporters will make films, deputies will make reports but until the district attorney prosecutes for obvious cruelty nothing will change.  Until the feds step up their game, nothing will change.

Consumers can ""demand change"" but as a last resort, when consumers buy direct from well respected small businesses nothing will change.",1511568000,,625,4.813084112149533
8350091,5,B0023W64WG,"Must see. Indeed the beginning is hard to see; but important to raise our awareness, at the end we as a consumer are responsible for not buying meat coming this way and government needs to have harsh rules and laws.",1507248000,,215,4.4

8350093,4,B0023W64WG,"This was a very good documentary regarding how animals are treated on factory farms. I did not like that they did not bleep out the ""F"" word that the undercover investigator, ""Pete"", was inclined to use quite a bit.",1468800000,,215,4.538461538461538
8350094,5,B0023W64WG,"Say no to factory farming. If people get offended and compare it to a regular hog farm, you are part of the problem. This about factories. Documentaries like this, forks over knives, food inc, the list goes on have all helped me make ethical humane choices in the food brought to my table. While I may be on my path to eating no meat, my family is not on that, but we can make
Humane ethical choices by buying local farm raised for them.",1468368000,2,437,4.214285714285714

8350096,5,B0023W64WG,"This opened my eyes to what is really going on in factory farms today. Its truly heart braking that as humans we can let this go on. It sickening and I want nothing todo with the meat industry! Not only how we treat our animals but also what is does to our health! I am a nurse and I agree that at the end of life its not easy to pass on. As they say in the documenery everything has to die! It comes with pain but as humans we have morphine to take the pain away. As humans we have doctors, nurses, and social workers looking out for us when we our sick. But animals have no one to look out for them! Only the humans that take a stand for them like Pete and Ingrid in this film! . I know that when I die I can't imagine ever wanting to be hung and in pain going without food or water. How is this humane!!!!!",1461024000,,809,3.8502994011976046

8350098,5,B0023W64WG,"As a small 6 acre farm homesteader I realize we have more options with our hogs, chickens, rabbits etc. Having to kill an animal is part of farming be it because of illness, injury or for butcher. Im on the fence about the hanging. I think it probably does cause more fear and torture than nessisary. Personally we chose to shoot our hogs when needed. I do agree the skull is thick but a larger caliber round for an adult would compesate for that. Yes it may cost up to a dollar or so depending on the round used but I believe that is the fastest and most humane form of euthanasia for a hog. They are very loving smart and affectionate animals when treated humainly. Mine eat from my hand even when they are upwards of 400-500 pounds. They ""talk"" to you and play. They thrive on playmates and sunshine and grass. Fresh air and resonably clean quarters. I relize this is hard to do from a commercial standpoint. BUT! It is possible if they downsize and use acerage provided. they would need to rotate as you do with cattle. I also relize this could cut down pork production if they downsized but they would also have less loss due to conditions. It balances out to a degree. They would have to charge more because this method costs more and is more labor intensive. But thats where the consumers have to step up and relize its worth it! I have had to talk to potential buyers of our hogs till i was blue in the face about why our hogs tasted better and had better meat color and the benifits of buying our hogs over mass produced pork sold at stores like wal-mart. It would take change and understanding on all sides to make a change like this and im just not sure humanity has the inteligence to understand it.",1449100800,8,1711,4.333333333333333
