1959242,5,B0000YHVMG,"Went to a movie last night called ""The Great Year,"" a new documentary about the prehistoric stoneworks that are found all over the world. Some open-minded researchers have finally realized all those ancient monuments are not just fancy graves, but an intricate system laid out across the planet to reflect the 'procession of the equinoxes,' a phenomenon science has never quite figured out. Current thought is that the earth's axis wobbles because of the moon's gravitational pull, thereby causing a different astrological sign to be prevalent during different epochs. (age of Pisces, Aquarius, etc.) That explanation, however, doesn't actually work out on computer models.
By finally putting all the pieces together, these archeologists now believe that  the ancients were trying to tell us not to forget that we are part of a binary star system, and that our sun is on an elliptical trajectory that drags all the planets with it, creating the processional effect. This binary sun theory makes all kinds of cosmic equations suddenly fall into place, and also explains lots of celestial mechanics that have been eluding us And it appears that as we approach the midpoint in our sun's orbit around it's mate, all kind of things will begin to happen in our little neighborhood (time speeds up, gravitational force changes, comets veer off course, etc...). Great graphics made this whole concept very easy to grasp and it was amazing to see how quickly everything fell into place once you applied this model.
The movie, narrated by James Earl Jones (love that voice!) also showed how this 'great cycle' possibly relates to the rise and fall of civilizations, because of the mounting evidence that there is a direct connection between this procession and our state of spiritual development. The Great Year is laid out as a huge 2400 year cycle, and is consistent in Mayan astronomy, the Vedic scriptures, Chinese astrology and Egyptian hieroglyphs, just to name a few.  They showed how many myths directly relate to this procession, from the bull worship cults (the end of Taurus) to the flood stories (the beginning of Pisces) that pop up in every culture.
The theory goes that we have a long Golden Age where we understand the whole cosmic scheme, then we begin a descent into darkness (Silver age) where we forget everything and fall into materialism and superstition (Bronze age). Then we slowly begin to figure out the bigger picture as we move back up into another Silver age. According to this system, we entered this final ""silver age"" during the renaissance and have been busy relearning our basic cosmic lessons ever since (like the fact that the world isn't flat and we aren't the center of the universe and that Columbus didn't discover America).
And just to make sure we don't have to figure it all out again from scratch, the last golden age, which ended 9,500 years ago, left us a permanent world wide calendar system just to explain this phenomenon (awfully thoughtful of them, don't you think?). Once we get the gist of how it works, we might be able to predict future events mathematically, like the Mayans.
SO, that's certainly food for thought, and puts a whole new light on the cyclic nature of mankind's evolution, dashing Darwin's linear theory in the process. It does mean that things just get better from here, and the last vestiges of our descent into darkness are destined to fall away as we approach our rendezvous with our other sun.
Of course, they haven't managed to find out which star that might be yet, but they're looking, at least. They've also discovered that lone solar systems are almost non-existent in our galaxy...almost every star has at least one mate...it's like a ballroom dance when they set the model in motion. Also goes back to what the Templars were trying to tell us, that everything is a duality, that monotheism is too limited as a cosmological concept. This non-linear aspect of development and our participation in the dance of the universe is blowing away the old paradigm of our lonely little solar system stuck out in the backwaters of the galaxy. It's pretty clear that we've got some serious re-thinking to do about our ideas of history, time and our place in the cosmic merry-go-round!",1087862400,23,4243,4.908077994428969
1959243,5,B0000YHVMG,"The Great Year is an engaging film that provokes one to think about time and our being in a grand scale rather than from a myopic perspective.  It is beautifully produced film that helps us rediscover a great cycle of time that spans thousands of years and its affect on human consciousness. The best hour I have every spent!
This documentary offers an elegant solution to observed phenomenon that had been clumsily ""explained"" by modern scientists who have been unwitting slaves to flawed axioms and theories.  Embedded in the films celestial truth is the connection between the movement of the stars and our human history. The Great Year is for those who are unafraid of putting aside hubris and opening their minds to the possibility that the ages bring forth human advancement and decline in cycles!  James Earl Jones magnificent voice rivets one attention to all the fascinating thoughts this pictures evokes.
You'll watch it over and over...",1087171200,9,947,4.981012658227848
1959244,1,B0000YHVMG,"This program mixes a number of interesting historical facts with absolute rubbish based on dubious theories, past and present. It makes absolutely no effort to distinguish between what is known to be true, and what might or might not be true. Instead, it relies on the all too human desire to believe in the unbelievable, simply because it is more fascinating than what we already know to be true, and uses that desire to promote a theory to which no reputable scientist gives even the smallest iota of credence.
Most specifically, the program resurrects a completely discredited theory that there is a binary companion to the Sun which is in some way responsible for a portion of the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation. THIS SUPPOSED COMPANION ABSOLUTELY CANNOT EXIST! The gravitational effects which cause our precession are an almost infinitesimally small portion of the overall effect of gravity, and if a binary companion to the Sun had enough of an effect on us to be in any way measurable, it would have far greater effects on the orbital motions of the planets -- effects which are NOT observed, and the lack of which absolutely proves the falsity of this theory. The only reality to this theory is that well-meaning people are deluded into wasting their time and money watching and buying this trash; which is, after all, all that the producers of such programs care about, in the first place.",1083196800,15,1410,4.830578512396694

1959247,4,B0000YHVMG,"The animations help understand some profound ideas, but I prefer Cruttenden's ""Lost Star of Myth and Time."" It's one of the best books that I have read recently. It's interesting to see the ideas from ancient India (and Greece, Egypt, Mayan cultures, etc., etc.) being resurrected. Unfortunatelyl, this brief DVD can't provide the supporting evidence that is found in the book. Nevertheless, this DVD is highly recommended for those who don't have the time to read the book.",1168300800,9,474,5.089743589743589
1959248,3,B0000YHVMG,"I was disappointed in this DVD because I expected it to be mostly about the Astrological/Spiritual result of this ""great year"" cycle. Instead it spent all of its time discussing the astronomy and physical artifacts connected to there being a great cycle and very little time dealing with the spiritual meaning of the cycle. The carefully made case presented here is a very interesting addition to the ""clock"" of Astrology, but it is a little like listening to all the reasons that Venus should exist and and then being told that it probably does exist and hoping that you will now hear when you will see it and what that will mean to you...and instead seeing the credits roll.",1166400000,10,676,4.689075630252101
1959249,5,B0000YHVMG,"I ordered this DVD after reading ""Lost Star of Myth and Time"" by Walter Cruttenden, which is a sequel to the book this DVD is based on.  There was a brief description of the DVD in the back of this book. The movie makes sense even if you haven't read either book, but if you want to see most of the evidence for its ideas, get the books.

The graphics make it much easier to visualize what the books talked about, and the narrative, interviews, and shots of various ancient sites present the idea very well.

In case you don't know, the general idea is that precession of the equinoxes is not caused by a wobble of the Earth's pole, as is assumed by conventional science, but by the Sun being part of a binary star system, and thus following an eliptical path through space and taking the Solar System along with it.  (So that it appears to be going backwards in relation to the ""fixed"" stars half of the time.) It's a logical idea that explains the observed phenomena.  So why don't we see the other star in the binary system?  Well, either it's too dark to see (for instance, a brown dwarf) or we do see it but its so far away currently that we don't yet recognize the relationship between our sun and the other star.

Much is made in the video, and the books, about the ancient traditions of golden ages having existed in the distant past and the idea in Hindu and other ancient traditions that civilization goes thru a series of ascending and descending eras that coincide with the ""Great Year"" during which the equinoxes precess thru all 12 constellations of the Zodiac.  And that this is caused by some unknown effects of either the companion star or the area of space the Solar System passes thru on its orbit around the dual system's center of gravity.  To my mind this is an entirely separate question.  There may be something to it, but it is not a necessary part of the binary star theory.

If you are at all interested in archeoastronomy, ancient mysteries, or just astronomy, this DVD is worth getting and watching.",1143244800,27,2028,4.454054054054054
1959250,5,B0000YHVMG,"This is a good, concise film, propounding a revolutionary concept that the Sun is a member of a binary star system, and that the Earth was host to previously unknown advanced civilisations outside the pale of known history (otherwise known among ""alternative"" theoreticians as ""paleocivilisations"") - and that the binary star system's cycle is responsible for the rise and fall of these various Human civilisational epochs. That is a matter related to eschatology or ""doomsday study"". The makers of this film base their assumptions on the ancient Hindu tradition of the Ages of Man, Plato's similar concept of the ""Great Year"", and numerous other similar traditions worldwide - most being based on, or found to be derived from the 26000 year cycle of the precession of our planet's axis of rotation. Although the film presents all this  somewhat optimistic and simplistically, there may be more to this approach than what the sceptic is inclined to think impulsively. I rate this film at five stars because of its revolutionary nature. But it is plagued by several discrepancies, in ignoring masses of other, albeit fragmented evidence available, regarding paleocivilisational issues. This is obscure ""specialist"" evidence, and is too numerous to detail here within this space. After all, it is the quest of all scholars in every field of endeavour to create a ""grand unified theory"" of their subject, so as to assemble diverse evidence into a coherent whole. And what we have available regarding the murky issues of paleocivilisations and related phenomena such as the ancient gods of myth and scripture, aliens, UFOs, fairies, angels, Atlantis and the Pyramids is very plentiful both physically and philosophically. It just needs clearing up and assembling. The film is also vague on source material to substantiate its conclusions. Moreover the main basis for its conclusions, the Hindu Yug(or ""Yuga"")concept of different human epochs of existence, is open to diverse interpretation: classical Vedic scholars interpret the Kal Yug (or ""Kali Yuga"" - Dark Age) as being 432,000 years long; the makers of this film estimate it at being around a more reasonable 2400 years or so. But this is still a great difference. Also ommitted here in their list of ages is the classical Vedic Age of Brahma, in which the entire universe is destroyed and then recreated - first as a lotus that then opens to reveal Brahma - the Hindu Supreme deity, who then proceeds to recreate everything. However, there are certain Hindu authorities on eschatology whose views are similar to those propounded in the film, but they reach conclusions that agree with other important sources of information that contradict this film's theory, and which its makers have overlooked. N.S.Rajaram, an Indian author who studied the sacred traditions of the legendary Hindu mystic scholar Ved Vyas, estimates the Kal Yug to have begun in 3012 B.C and to have ended around 1999. That is around 5100 years. Ved Vyas was said to have been born at around this time. This date coincides with the Mayan Calendrical cycle that holds our (present) human era of the ""Fourth Sun"" to have begun on August 12, 3114 B.C precise - which will end in seven years' time on 21 December 2012. 3100 B.C is also the time when mankind's known, recorded, history is officially agreed upon by all the world's authorities, to have inexplicably begun: the ""sudden"" appearance of the Sumerian civilisation, the first true human civilisation, followed quickly by the dramatic rise of Dynastic Egypt and the Mohenjodaro-Harappa Indus valley urban culture of India, and a few years hundred later by the first Chinese ""heavenly kingdom"". This period is also referred to by some as the Adamic Age. In other words, the age that Ved Vyas told us began as the Dark Age is universally recognised as all of history, all that we or science know about us being civilised beings: there is no known trace of human civilisation prior to it except in ""improbable"" myths and legends such as those of Biblical Eden and Atlantis to mention but just two. Yet all these myths have so strong an impact on humanity's collective cultural psyche, as to be sacred. So the question needs addressing as to whether all our history so far has been that of a dark age only, or not, in the light of this plausible cyclic theory. But I also don't think that these cycles come or go with the clockwork regularity as the film would have us believe. The evidence to the contrary is too much. The makers of the film imply that the Sun's binary ""twin"" affects the civilisational changes, but don't tell us how other than that it causes the precesssional ""wobble"". They don't tell us how this wobble affects civilisation, other than causing the symbolic movement of the spring equinox.  This neat theory, while having its merits, also doesn't take into account sudden/irregular catastrophic civilisational changes, such as those from asteroid and cometary strikes or shifting movements of the Earth's crust.",1137974400,14,5005,5.014423076923077
1959251,4,B0000YHVMG,"An engaging documentary that intertwines the phenomena known as precession through the Equinoxes and how, the rise and fall of civilizations may be linked to this on a grander scale. All indications point to the ancients being obsessed with the heavens and having been aware of this cyclical grand cycle.  Their knowledge of the cosmos without our current stage of technological advancement defies our ability to explain their insight on such an expansive scale. Yet several ancient cultures utilizing advanced geometry and astronomy all had names for this vast cycle and the effect it played on mankind.

For years the academic community has told us these ancient writings amount to no more than fairly tales.

Now several institutions are examining the possibility that ancient civilizations were more advanced than previously thought...  a theory that does not sit well with traditionalists in conservative academic circles.

Does history and civilization move in vast cycles? Was there really a Golden Age when people lived a more profound and exalted existence on a higher plane of enlightenment? An age where wisdom and spirituality won out over illusion and materialism? The ""Great Year"" delves into seldom charted territory with interviews from those who believe there is a physical celestial force that can cause humanity as a whole to either lapse into collective amnesia, or to advance us beyond our known metaphysical understanding and collective consciousness.

Along with angular momentum, precession through the polar stars, and annual precession rates, the film includes interviews with archaeologists, professors of history and astronomy, all describing various traits of the Great Year. The hypothesis presented in the documentary is a provocative alternative to the widely accepted luni-solar model as the cause of precession replaced with a new model of  binary motion. Still, while a very worthwhile watch, this is not a ""tell all"" documentary, and whether by choice or omission you will need to do a little exploring on your own to discover what all the commotion is about.",1137801600,35,2095,5.349544072948328
1959252,5,B0000YHVMG,"Did highly advanced civilizations exist on the earth long before conventional history wants us to believe? Civilizations that understood secrets in astronomy, mathematics and many other fields of scientific endeavor that have unfortunately been lost with the passing of time, now buried somewhere in the sands of antiquity.

Are the ancient tales of an antediluvian ""Golden Age"" populated by beings with miraculous God-like abilities really just nothing more than myth and legend? Or are they in reality the last remaining fragmentary accounts of what mankind once was and may become again in some future age?

Warning, this documentary will challenge everything you've been taught about history, astronomy, religion and the nature and destiny of mankind. Be ready to postulate such concepts as:

1) The discovery of a 24,000 year celestial cycle which determines the rise and fall of civilizations and man's ability to comprehend 'higher wisdom.'

2) A 'second sun' rotating in conjunction with our own.

3) Flying machines and intercontinental travel thousands of years before the pyramids were built.

4) A time when telepathy, levitation and other psychic powers were commonplace.

The binary theory being very scientific, but its influence on civilization is a bit more questionable. The only bad thing is the Byrds song (turn, turn, turn), kind of cheesy and too obvious of a selection.

1959254,5,B0000YHVMG,"""The Great Year"" is a well produced documentary that explores the possible link between ancient cosmogonic myths and modern astronomical observations, using great animations, a riveting narration and a beautiful underscore the whole family will enjoy. There are not very many non-fiction films on the market today that educate the average viewer about the significance of the hardly perceptible daily third movement of our own planet - the slow but gradual change of the orientation of Earth's axis in space. Not every astronomer and astrologer - whether a professional or an amateur - may agree with some of the experts in the film that this movement is caused by the motion of our sun around some unknown partner star. However, the film raises important questions about the mechanics of this celestial phenomenon and brings forth concise arguments that have merit. While the scientific aspect gives the film its heuristic character, it is the revealing message of the film that makes it so compelling. We gradually become aware again of an element in nature that offers mankind the possibility to overcome the negativity and the uncertainty of the world and age we live in.  It will be quite fascinating to see if astronomers are able to detect this nameless companion star of our sun that supposedly influences human consciousness. But must science first confirm that we are connected to something far greater than our intellect and instruments are able to perceive?",1121385600,13,1469,5.120833333333334
