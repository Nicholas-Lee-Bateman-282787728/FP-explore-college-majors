The varied lessons learned from studying The People's Temple and Jonestown are still relevant in the 21st century, and any parent with a teenager would be well advised to watch this with their son or daughter. Students of psychology would be well informed by reading Neal Osherow's analysis of these events, and polysci students should be encouraged to examine how Jones was able to become a favorite of the Northern California political elite in the late 1970s. The inaccuracies mentioned revolve around the combination of characters and the modified portrayal of Congressmen Leo Ryan's visit to Jonestown, but these really do not diminish the film's contribution to increasing our understanding of the power of cults.",1114905600,2,1066,5.389221556886228
