3923832,5,B002FP9QBC,A great new challenging  workout from the Pure Barre series. I was very excited to find this since I LOVE the first one!,1249948800,6,120,4.217391304347826
3923836,4,B002FP9QBC,The exercises were challenging but not impossible. I was sore afterward which was good. I went to the studio for a few months but couldn't afford it so I bought the DVD. I would suggest going to a studio before doing the video so you know how to properly engage your muscles when you're doing the exercises.,1354752000,6,307,4.4035087719298245
3923837,5,B002FP9QBC,"Started with this DVD, now I'm a teacher at a studio.  Nothing has ever changed my body like this.  LIFER!",1351814400,3,106,4.25
3923838,3,B002FP9QBC,"I bought this hoping to use it occasionally instead of taking a live Pure Barre class-- when I'm traveling, or to save money occasionally by doing this as a substitute for the real class. But this was really basic...for example in the core warm-up, legs are at table top instead of out straight, and you only do a handful of push ups. There is no flat back portion of class, which I understand, because that would be harder to do from home and if you don't understand the PB technique. There is also no ""real"" music, just sort of a little background tune. I assume that's because it is far too expensive to purchase the rights to use popular music, but it really detracts from the intensity of the class. In the live class the music is energizing and motivating and that is missing here.",1345593600,13,787,4.43448275862069
3923839,3,B002FP9QBC,"I typically work out using my computer and it has great sound (it works well with Insanity, Turbo Fire etc.) so I figured it would work well with this DVD. I cannot hear the instructor half of the time - which really aggravated me. I feel like if they can charge $25 per class then they could afford to have better sound/video.

That aside - the workout IS ROUGH. It really took me a while (between this DVD and mile high 1 DVD) to get through this one. (the Mile high dvd is about 34 mins and this one is longer).

With that said - I ended up buying Pershing Square 2 which is supposed to come in the next few days!!!",1342828800,,618,4.057377049180328
3923840,4,B002FP9QBC,"Great workout. Legs were shaking and I was feeling tired. A few problems, however, were plagueing this great workout!
1. The outfits. For the leg section, it is important to see what the people are doing...you can't when they are wearing long yoga pants. The instructor (and founder) even mentions this during the ""explanation"" of the moves.
2. It's hard to see what the people are doing with their legs when the camera angle is shot from the waist up. This happened in a few routines.
3. I feel that it really wasn't enough stretching to satisfy the workout. I ended up stretching for a few minutes afterwards.
4. The stretching (what was there), wasn't really enough. I would just start to feel a stretch and the instructor would be moving onto the next move.

Ok, enough bashing. It was a great workout, as Pure Barre is, but those minor irriations can lead someone to try this disc then move on...don't. It's a really great workout, just be aware that some minor adjustments adn this would totally be a ""go to"" disc.",1338768000,9,1020,4.604395604395604
3923841,5,B002FP9QBC,"I have taken several Pure Barre classes at studios and was a little worried that the DVD wouldn't be quite as challenging - I was wrong. This was a great workout. The only thing I missed was the music in class but now I have the opportunity to put together my own playlists.
The Pure Barre method will change your body quickly. Definitely worth a shot!",1330560000,4,352,4.348484848484849
3923842,5,B002FP9QBC,"I've taken dance, lifted weights, ran, done yoga, love pilates. I am not a fanatic, but am pretty fit for a 46 year-old.

This workout really fatigued my muscles and encouraged me to use my thighs more. I had a difficult time getting through the thigh part. I loved the challenge and went on to buy more of her dvds. I find the instructor's commentary very helpful. She has alignment tips that make a big difference to me.

I would not do this workout as my only workout, but I find it very good to use in addition to the other activities that I enjoy.  For example, if I don't have energy for a dance class, I use this dvd (or another of hers). The workout is only 45 minutes, so I am always able to con myself into doing it. No matter that it is also very challenging! he fact that it is only 45 minutes lets me tell myself to just start it. Then I end up finishing.

Overall,  it is a keeper!",1322179200,,895,4.091428571428572
3923843,3,B002FP9QBC,"So I really, really wanted to LOVE this workout. I'm a cardioholic with a secondary love for barre workouts (skinnyfat just won't do!), and I'm constantly looking for ways to change up the way I work my muscles. Although this is the level 1 DVD, the Amazon reviewers seemed to think it was challenging enough, and I was in the market for a nice, lower-key but still burntastic workout.

My conclusion? This DVD is fabulous for the glutes (totally disagree with the reviewer who says that they don't spend enough time/energy on this area) and just 'eh' for everything else. My bum was absolutely on fire for the entire glutes section, and I credit this to Carrie's various rotations that were completely new (an impressive feat since most barre workouts are derived from the same Lotte Berk method workouts).

As for why I'm so lukewarm on the rest... I'm still figuring that out. I honestly think having one of the little red balls (like a half-size playground ball) would make this workout 100 percent better, but I haven't found one yet and I'm not quite down to drop $12 plus shipping and handling on one from the Pure Barre website. Also, Carrie and her background exercises wear long black lululemon-style pants that, at times, obscure the ways their bodies are moving especially from certain camera angles. This can present a pretty large problem in even the best-cued barre workouts when movement has to be as precise as a quarter of an inch. Moreover, I really felt like this workout totally neglected abs (not even 10 minutes!) and arms.

Again, I want to like this workout. I want to LOVE this workout. It's fine, and I'll definitely keep it in my rotation, but the bottom line is that it's really only good for your, well, bottom.",1313107200,5,1741,4.701639344262295
3923844,3,B002FP9QBC,"I was a bit unhappy to get the DVD in the mail and get ready to workout only to discover I needed a Pure Barre ball. I did not see that anywhere when I purchased it and it does not say anything on the outside of the tape.
I was expecting more ballet or a better mix of ballet and pilates. It seems to be mostly pilates only with a small ball. It is still a good workout though.",1311120000,4,377,3.7848101265822787
3923845,2,B002FP9QBC,"Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in this video... I'm ready to resell it as I don't think I will do it again.  This woman has great intentions but falls short on quality and instruction.  I took a pure barre class this past summer and even though you can't directly compare a live class with a video, this video really didn't come close to a class.  The quality, lack of instructing proper technique, phony sounding motivation and rushing through the moves left me wondering why I spent my money on it.  It really felt like she was trying to cram as many exercises as she could in... in the allotted time she had for the video, very rushed.  I'm sure if you haven't done other videos like this one you might think it's good but if you haven't than get something with superior quality with people who take the time to focus on good technique, challenge you and motivate you... try  the Core Fusion collection with Elisabeth Halfpapp and Fred DeVito.  It is WAY more worth your money and way more satisfying when you are done with the workout.",1288051200,11,1048,4.542553191489362
3923849,5,B002FP9QBC,"I've always had a hard time sticking with fitness programs. A few months ago I decided enough was enough and took a similar class since I loved dance and ballet as a kid. I bought this DVD so I could supplement my fitness routine when I cannot make it to The Dailey Method studio (another Lotte Burk inspired studio). The program gives me a GREAT work out and the instructor is very likable (bonus that the music in the program doesn't sound like musak!). I totally recommend this DVD, especially if you are a busy mom who needs a highly efficient fitness program. I love it!",1286150400,,575,4.433962264150943
3923850,4,B002FP9QBC,"In all fairness, I only used thiis Pure Barre DVD only a few times before deciding I need to get a bit more in shape before I pull this out again. THAT said, for someone in decent shape I truly believe this is an amazing workout.  My daughter in law has attended Pure Barre classes and says her thighs have never burned more - I believe it because my thighs were actually shaking.  The setting of this DVD is very serene and the instructor does a great job.  If you are good at doing doing modifications even a fairly fit beginner might be able to do this - instruction for modifications are provided.  I just tend to overdo so this will just have to wait until I build up a bit further.  After that.....watch out - this will be the first DVD I grab.",1286064000,4,750,4.180555555555555
3923851,3,B002FP9QBC,"Let me preface this by saying that by religiously working out at home (5x a week usually) with the Core Fusion series and the Bar Method series DVDs over the last 6 months, I have had a *tremendous* transformation of my body. I had a baby about 10 months ago, and since starting with barre workouts with Core Fusion (Elizabeth and Fred) and Bar Method (Burr Leonard) I am in fantastic shape- better than ever in my life, even pre-baby. I must add I am not affiliated with either Core Fusion or Bar method, just a satisfied at home student (I've never even taken a studio class of either). I have the Fluidity DVDs and use them occasionally too, but since I find them to be inferior to Core Fusion or Bar Method in content I won't compare them to Pure Barre here.

Now, after having done Core Fusion and Bar Method for 6 months, I was looking to add some variety to my dvd collection. I saw that Pure Barre had such fantastic reviews so I *had* to have a copy.  I must say, I just completed the workout in its entirety and I am disappointed.  The Pure Barre workout is obviously derived from Lotte Berk and Pilates, like Core Fusion and Bar Method, but it is an inferior imitation of either in my opinion. The workout itself, taken alone, seems good if you are just starting barre workouts. However, compared to my beloved Core Fusion or Bar Method, it does not hold a candle. The workout isn't nearly as strenuous or as well rounded as Bar Method, and it seems incomplete somehow compared to Core Fusion. Carrie is obviously a lot less experienced compared to Elizabeth, Fred or Burr. She doesn't spend enough time on gluteal work on this dvd and so even with a fairly challenging thigh set, I didn't feel like I got a complete workout at the end.

Additionally, I find the production quality on this dvd lacking compared to either of the aforementioned dvds. Some of the camera angles are awkward, many of the camera shots are shaky, the lighting is dull, and the set is sterile.  I find BM and CF to be much better production quality and much more aesthetically pleasing.

Also Carrie is a lot less inspiring than Elizabeth or Burr. She is pleasant and like-able but not in fantastic shape. My apologies for sounding shallow, but it is important to me that the instructor of an athletic dvd have an inspiring physique. Elizabeth and Burr are both probably twice the age of Carrie, and in ten times better shape (especially Burr, who was 62 I believe when the DVDs were produced!).  If the instructor of the DVD isn't an obvious example of the results of what they teach, I am not motivated to continue. Quite frankly I'm confused because as a home student of barre workouts I look pretty darn good now and I would assume that Carrie, being the teacher/founder of Pure Barre would have the tight body and sinewy physique of a professional dancer a la Dancing with the Stars.

If this had been the first barre workout dvd I had gotten, I think I would have probably not been motivated to continue daily. And that is a shame, considering the huge results I've gotten from Bar Method and Core Fusion. Luckily for me I found Core Fusion first and Elizabeth and Fred really inspire me.

I give Pure Barre 3 stars on average: 3 1/2 for the workout and 2 1/2 for the production quality/instructor.

Bottom line: This is not a terrible workout, and it has redeeming qualities. But if you are looking for an inspiring barre workout that will REALLY give you results, I recommend the Core Fusion series (any of them, although body sculpt is the best overall workout and I love the glutes and thighs dvd) OR the Bar Method dvds (and definitely buy both- they are challenging and deliver fantastic results).",1273708800,180,3696,4.519461077844311
3923852,5,B002FP9QBC,"Going on week 3 of this Pure Barre workout DVD and look forward to every workout. It does a great job of delivering challenging unique exercises, mostly for the lower body (I've never seen my legs shake so much)and core area. It's does a good job of keeping you engaged and interested by changing up the exercises slightly while still targeting the same area.

As a fitness instructor, I have tried many diffent workouts in a gym environment as well as at home workouts (P90X, etc) and I must say, Pure Barre has become my new favorite! I am already seeing and feeling results after two weeks of buying this DVD. Highly recommend!",1268697600,5,630,4.575221238938053
3923853,4,B002FP9QBC,"I generally practice yoga in a studio, but when I don't have time to drive and need a quick workout, the Pure Barre video is a good alternative.  A lot of the moves in the warm-up, stretches, and cool down are derived from Yoga and Pilates, although the versions in the video are for beginners.  I usually go into my own postures during this time, based on how comfortable I am.  The actual work outs seem to work, I have only had the video for a couple of weeks, and so far I am happy.

All in all, this is a great 45 minute work out that I use in conjunction with other workouts and I am very happy.  I would definitely recommend this product.",1268092800,4,645,4.128
3923854,5,B002FP9QBC,"this combination of pilates, weight resistance using your own body weight, and yoga is tougher than it looks from just watching the exercises. the exercises target deep muscles and really ache or burn after the first set. however, muscles start firming up quickly, and twice per week is effective. form is more important than the number of repetitions that you can do, so watch the instructions and the whole dvd before you begin. i use a rolled up towel instead of the ball that they sell. i would probably recommend an easier dvd of similar exercises if you are a beginner. however, by modifying the workout as directed and doing fewer repetitions, you can handle the exercises if you aren't new to firming routines. good luck.",1265500800,18,729,4.7936507936507935
3923855,5,B002FP9QBC,"My name is Angela, I have the original and now this one, and I love both, I have the old bar Method and both squeeze,and even the new callanetics, but the ones that I use the most are this, you really feel your lower body burning, no too much upper body. Very hard, I'll buy the 2nd. one, so I have more variety. Buy it you won't regreted.",1258675200,6,339,4.0
3923856,3,B002FP9QBC,"I was disappointed with Pure Barre: Pershing Square 1 because it wasn't ""pure barre"". The workout is great but I was looking for something with real barre work. I am a dancer and was looking for something that I could follow along at home with when I'm not in classes; barre excercises that would challenge me. If you are not a dancer, this is a great workout but if you are, it's nothing but a workout and has little, if anything, relatable to barre. If anyone knows of a good at home barre workout dvd, please post a review response and let me know.",1254355200,10,551,4.3076923076923075
3923857,5,B002FP9QBC,"This is a tough workout. Not for anyone who is new to barre workouts. I have almost all the barre workouts available and this is defiantly the toughest.

3923858,5,B002FP9QBC,"I have and LOVE the first Pure Barre workout.  This workout (Carrie with 3-4 PB instructors) looks to have been filmed in a nice bright room with lots of windows with Carrie instructing and giving tips.  Much brighter than the original PB.  This workout does not disappoint in any way!  It is a non-stop burn fest for your thighs, glutes and hip area.  After the traditional barre type warmup (knee ups), it's right down to the mat for some plank work, tricep dips knee pushups and back to standing at your support.  Carrie uses a small ball to be held behind knee as you squeeze and pulse in familiar barre moves.  There are more done without the ball.  Having to hold that ball in place really cranks it up a notch and gets into the hamstring intensely.  There is also some inner thigh standing work (popping the heels).  Carrie and class hold onto the side of a wall for support, you can use a chair or anything really for a support.  Working the same leg, you move to the floor and continue frying with various lying moves extending the leg from the hip.  My hip was begging for mercy.  There are also some quick stretches thrown in between.  After you repeat on the other side, you move on to abs holding on your ball.  I prefer to use my pilates ring for this ab series.  I have done it using a ball and feel it intensely but I just feel like I get a better grip and squeeze going then with the ball.  You could do it with nothing and still feel the abs working intensely :)  There is a nice soothing stretch at the end.  The DVD also has some extras where you can get more tips on form and is chaptered.

I have been rotating Pershing 1 & 2 and I have to say I love them both but I find myself most sore from this one and I think that's from the lying floor work.  The 2 DVDs compliment each other -- get both!",1250985600,75,1817,4.178674351585014
8369470,3,B002FP9QBC,Not as challenging as other barre workouts. And the location filmed is not the most scenery one.,1528329600,,96,4.705882352941177

8369472,5,B002FP9QBC,"I am a fan of the gyms and the exercise programs by Pure Barre. I went to the gym for a while but due to budget constraints I decided to get their workout video. I really like the format and the workouts. I like the fact that the programs are like dancing. I am a former dancer and still do tap and in between practices, this keeps me fluid and get me off the couch which is always good!",1432512000,2,387,3.911392405063291
8369473,3,B002FP9QBC,"I got Core Fusion Barre Basics at Target. I love it. I am in good Sharpe for a 50 year old. But the 10 minute work outs bust your butt in very little time. I dropped a pant size in two weeks using one 10 miminute work out three times a week.

I was excited to try Pure Barre. But immediately
disappointed. The creator/star of the dvd is lack luster. Uninspiring. And pudgy compared to Elizabeth (who is probably twice her age) on the Core Fusion disk. An entire 55 minute workout
didn't push me at all. It was dull.

Oddly, I found the fast paced music, also used in Core Fusion, ill suited for the slow and steady barre moves.",1419638400,,627,4.1735537190082646

8369475,5,B002FP9QBC,"The Pershing Square 1 workout from Carrie Rezabeks Pure Barre DVD series is one of the best at-home barre workouts Ive done.  Both the floor work and the support work using the ball give the exact same feel and results through the seat and thigh that you get from the pricy studio classes.  Of course, nothing can compare to having your Pure Barre instructor there to help you perfect your form but Carries coaching throughout the workout is spot-on.  Its almost like she knows when you're going to lose your form and need a little reminder.
Like many of the workouts using rubber or weighted balls, the balance and grip on the ball can be tricky if you wear slick pants but you can master the moves.  Your thighs and glutes will be shaking and burning in no time and youll see the results quickly.  It only took me 3 workouts to really see the lifted/toned/sculpted/curved results!",1408320000,4,882,4.592356687898089

8369477,5,B002FP9QBC,"I am a fairly new convert to Barre workouts.  My usual routines consist of heavy weight training or intense cardio.  I am so happy to have found workouts that are effective and much easier on my joints.

My only other experience with Barre is from Tracy Effinger's Squeeze series.  I loved that series and I am happy to say that I love Pure Barre Pershing Square.

Why I love Pershing Square 1:

* The loft setting in Pershing Square.  I am an East Coast gal and I'm fascinated by California.  I love the views of Pershing Square.  When I use this DVD, I almost feel as though I'm in LA.

* The killer exercises.  The seated and lying down exercises were harder for me than the standing ones.  I have a love/hate relationship with the lying leg circles.  They make my muscles scream, but they really do tone my legs.

* The standing leg work.  I feel so graceful and stand taller after I'm done.

* The concentration needed to do the exercises correctly.  I find that when I do cardio, my mind is usually wandering.  The small, precise movements required in barre really force me to think about what muscles I am using.

* The minimal equipment needed.  All you need is a mat and a small ball.  I use a yoga block in place of the small ball and it works fine.

* The DVD set up.  You can play the entire workout, or just sections.  A Body Positioning tutorial is also included.  Having correct body alignment is especially important in barre since you're working your muscles with very precise movements.

* The fact that there are two DVDs in this series, Pershing Square 1 and 2.  When I come across a workout that I love, I tend to do it over and over.  This way, I can alternate between the two.

I think this workout is a little easier than the Squeeze series, but that's okay.  I love having different barre routines to use.

The only relatively minor negative is that Carrie doesn't mirror cue and that was confusing at first.  As I became more familiar with the moves and the body positioning, it didn't bother me as much.

The primary focus is legs, hips, glute, core and lower back.  There is a little bit of upper body in the warm up, but not enough to really work those muscles.

If you want a fun, challenging and effective barre workout, you will enjoy this one.",1364860800,8,2276,4.363636363636363

Overall it's a LOT like bring in class. She's to the point & descriptive (no annoying filler talk or stump speeches). You don't need a barre, a chair at most. Having the ball does help and adds to the burn! Get it cheap on amazon.
