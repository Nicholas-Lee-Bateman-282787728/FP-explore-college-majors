7882724,2,6305104522,"And it's still a pretty awful movie, no matter what they call it. (My DVD has the title as ""Night Onchid"". Yes, they misspelled ""Orchid"" right on the box! I believe this is the same movie also known as ""The Lone Ninja Warrior"" and ""The Demon Fighter"". Whereas ""Faster Blade Poisonous Darts"" is also the title of a completely different movie (Amazon.com has the VHS version of that movie linked in with the DVD of this one). At any rate, the movie I'm reviewing now is the one called ""Wu Ye Lan Hua"" (pinyin title) which means ""Midnight Orchid"", the one starring Adam Cheng and Brigitte Lin.) So anyway, it's based on a series of novels by Gu Long about a chivalrous thief (a sort of Chinese Robin Hood with an eye for the ladies) and his drunkard sidekick. Adam Cheng played the same character in a number of (far superior) TV adaptations. You know it's the same guy because he rubs his nose a lot, fights with a fan, and has the same theme music...

The plot is basically standard formula #2 (with a secret dash of formula #1, the Revenge Plot). Here, 1) Some villain wants to be #1/take over the ""Martial World""/China/whatever, 2) the Hero is his main obstacle, but 3) the Hero is formidable and elusive, so 4) the villain gets at him through his friends and family and by planting agents nearby. 5) Throw in a romantic subplot involving a beautiful actress. I found it both obvious and nonsensical. In this case, Chu Liu Xiang (the Hero) starts the movie wallowing in guilt/depression because one of his lady friends died for his sake (but it's not actually shown here, not even in flashback), and most people think he's dead. The villain knows better, however, and the first 10-15 minutes are all a scheme to lure CLX out of retirement, with one such Friend-of-CLX under siege. After CLX shows up, we never see those people again. Oh, except for the bouncy little assassin who goes around stealing people's heads for some reason. There's also another assassin who leaves an orchid behind as their calling card. Oooo...spoooky! No, not really. And then CLX rescues Brigitte Lin's character from being a human sacrifice, and there's a bunch of stuff involving a kinky princess who lives in a cave (and the movie looks like it's going to degenerate into cheesy porn...), and more people die, and this or that character is thrown at us as a red herring...

They're supposed to be Persians! (According to the dialogue.) Even if they're dressed like Indians or Egyptian pharoahs (well, a Halloween costume version) or whatever. They're Persians. With ninjas! Persian ninjas in black and white bodysuits! WTF! Sadly, the abundant WTF-ery doesn't make up for it being a boring and incoherent movie. I only gave it 2 stars because I like Adam Cheng and Brigitte Lin and the movie did have a few decent moments.

For a better movie adaptation with the same character, I recommend ""Clans of Intrigue"" (the 1977 Shaw Brothers classic starring Ti Lung as CLX.) If you want to see Adam Cheng and Brigitte Lin together in a movie, watch ""Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"" (1983) instead. (The plot for that one is even more of a mess, but the movie is deliriously inventive and energetic.)",1274918400,,3182,4.678571428571429
7882725,4,6305104522,"i was very entertained by the weirdness and very good swordplay of this movie. this is a old school classic in my opinion. i won't lie, it gets boring at times. this movie is also called night orchard vs shaolin. there is another movie called faster blade poisonous darts with ""beardy"" leung in it. that one is pretty damn good too....",1222819200,,335,4.508196721311475
7882726,2,6305104522,"Whenever a massive movie comes out -- such as ""Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"" -- you can expect the studios to rush out anything similar. That was the case with ""Faster Blade Poisonous Darts,"" which is beautiful and stars some great actors -- but the plot was apparently made up as they went along.

The story opens with three martial artists in a temple, guarding the priceless Jade Horse, and being menaced by a bunch of soldiers outside. Two of them venture out and are attacked by a bizarre demon-thing that springs out of a woman's stomach. The third is fatally injured, but escapes with the Jade Horse, and is rescued by a legendary warrior (Adam Cheng), who reveals that the Horse is not the real one.

Now forget that entire opening.  Apparently the writer and director did, because nothing in it is ever referred to again.

Instead, our hero and his sidekicks manage to rescue a beautiful princess (Brigitte Lin) from a murderous cult that's about to sacrifice her. Upon finding her father dead and home burned, our hero takes her back to a paradisical place where his sisters reside -- but which isn't quite safe, since a seductive Indian woman captures his pals.

And things are getting even nastier, since secret assassins are appearing at random and killing various innocent people, including friends of the hero's. The only hint is an orchid left behind. Now the hero and his girlfriend must uncover who these demon assassins are, who the murderer is, and who is the one in charge of all this.

Confused yet? It's literally impossible to follow the movie, which careens from one subplot to another, with nothing to connect them.

With a plot that jumbled and confused, it's no wonder that there's nothing much going on that makes sense. We get Egyptian temples, beast-men, religious cults, sensual murders, and slinky Indian ladies who show up just to show up. Few of these things actually stick around for more than one scene, and even fewer have a reason to be there.

Cheng and Lin are brilliant actors, but neither one really has much to do in this movie. Cheng smiles sly and rubs his nose a lot, but we don't get any insights into the character. Lin is basically a confused-looking damsel who doesn't do much of anything until the last scenes. And I have no idea who most of the other characters are, because we're never told -- the only really interesting one is the creepy femme fatale.

The saving grace is the beauty of the movie. The haven that Cheng takes Lin to is an exquisite, open-air place draped with flowers, sort of a Chinese Rivendell. Flowers, smoke, bright trees and misty skies fill the other scenes. And the flying action scenes are suitably cool and stylish, with Cheng kicking butt with a fan.

Bad dubs aside, ""Faster Blade Poisonous Darts"" is literally the most incomprehensible kung-fu movie I have ever seen. It's a pretty spectacle, but anyone hoping for a plot is going to be incredibly disappointed.",1175126400,4,2954,4.729571984435798
7882727,3,6305104522,"Adam Cheng stars in this one not Roc Tien as the movie sleeve would suggest, and all the pics on the back do not actually appear in the film but none the less it is still a classic film. Some impressive and creative fights, and a lot of blood make this a very entertaining movie.",989107200,4,279,4.090909090909091
