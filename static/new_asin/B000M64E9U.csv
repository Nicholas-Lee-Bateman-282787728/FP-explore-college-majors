8166686,5,B000M64E9U,"This is my #1 all time favorite cartoon.
I was 9 years old when this came out with the Snick lineup - Are You Afraid of The Dark, All That, Clarissa Explains It All, The Adventures of Pete and Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack. That was when Nickelodeon was so much fun and easygoing. Oh yeah Guts and Legend of Thr Hidden Temple.

Characters: Powdered Tost Man, Jimminy Lummox, Muddy Mud Skipper, Mr. Horse, that insane dude George Liquor American, the circus midgets, Ask Dr. Stupid, the psycho firefighter who hated circus midgets, the unseen face couple (the really hot wife and her husband that has the pipe, sock garters and a burgundy colored house robe), various roadkill.

I had the talking Ren doll - you would pull his belly button and he would say stuff like ""why don't you play with your magic nose goblins"" and ""you fat bloated eeediot!"" My brother had the farting Stimpy - squeeze him, he poots and his tounge would go up.

That was around the time Disney's Beauty and The Beast and Aladdin came out, Gummi Bears, Darkwing Duck, Goof Troop, Tale Spin, then Aeon Flux, which was part of MTV's Oddities (The Head, Daria, The Maxx, Bevis and Butthead). Also Pirates of Dark Water (which was never completed) - I could go on forever!

If could go back in time during the 1990s when things was more awesome, simple, enjoyable, music was music and cartoons were cartoons - I totally would.

But I can't - I just enjoy having a great time watching Ren and Stimpy with my kids.",1437523200,,1486,4.5092936802973975

8166690,5,B000M64E9U,"This is definately a must have for any Ren & Stimpy fan, prior to when MTV got ahold of the cartoon series.  Excellent price for the package DVD set.",1262563200,2,149,4.137931034482759
