8031044,4,B0002S65RM,"In Dos Criados Malcriados(Two Rude Butlers, 1960), Viruta and Capulina(Marco Antonio Campos and Gaspar Henaine) get a job as butlers for a wealthy family. Viruta and Capulina develop a crush on the master's two daughters(played by real life sisters Lorena Velazquez and Tere Velazquez). Unfortunately, Viruta and Capulina have to deal with two burglars who want to rob from the master's safe!
 This film deserves one star just for sex appeal; the scene where Lorena and Tere Velazquez swim in a pool is prime example of ""innocent eroticism"". Pancho Cordova and Roberto Gomez Bolanos ""Chespirito"" (who also penned the script) play two burglars. Chespirito likes to show off his love for Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis, The Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers, electronica music and Disney movies. This film isn't avant garde or art, but it does manage to please. There's gags involving broken dishes and vases as well as Chespirito's face getting stuck in a safe door! Lorena Velazquez must've had millions of fanboys in the 1950's; she oozes sex appeal and pulchritude! The late Tere Velazquez also appears in this film. I've been a fan of hers after seeing Quinceanera(1959). This film is must-see for fans of Viruta and Capulina.",1253491200,4,1232,5.068965517241379
