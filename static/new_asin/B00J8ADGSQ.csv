8648718,3,B00J8ADGSQ,"I'm not sure what to think about Dr. Olshock's golf instruction. The video is about two hours long, complicated, strangely low key (kind of the opposite of Michael Breed's type of presentation), organized in a way that is a little hard to follow, and unorthodox compared to other golf instruction. The material is presented in sections on the setup, backswing, transition, delivery to post impact, and finish, five major sections, though the title of the program is 4 Pathways to a Simple Golf Swing. Each section is presented in two parts, the first of which includes demonstrations and drills and the second explanations and rationale, including the identification of muscles responsible for the movements demonstrated. Dr. Olshock, who is apparently a practicing MD, mentions that he teaches at a golf instruction school called Jake's Academy, but there's no mention of him on Jake's Academy's website, and Dr. Olshock's website is no longer active. I can find no review, endorsement, or recommendation for Dr. Olshock's golf instruction other than the reviews of his DVD on Amazon. Some of what he says seems accurate, based on my experience; some is similar to what other, better known, instructors have taught; and some seems out there on its own, peculiar to Dr. Olshock. Maybe that's the conclusion, it's peculiar.",1461110400,3,1322,5.153488372093023

8648720,5,B00J8ADGSQ,This golf DVD is one of a kind.  All of the drills are easy to do and I actually played better after practicing what I learned here.  I would recommend this to any golfer who actually wants to get better at golf.,1437523200,,212,4.023809523809524
8648721,5,B00J8ADGSQ,"I am one of those golfers that love reading about the swing and don't mind a little experimentation to try new things so I was intrigued by this DVD on Amazon.  I ordered it and was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this DVD on the golf swing.  I found the instruction to be clear and I loved how he tied the drills to a why do it which is where many golf instruction DVDs fall short.  I have not had a chance to try to drills yet so I will update this as I go.

I highly recommend this DVD for golfers who want to know more about the golf swing and the biomechanics of why this swing works.",1417651200,,608,3.9186991869918697
8648722,5,B00J8ADGSQ,"There is no other instructional video like this.  It clear that Dr Golfshock has a keen understanding of human anatomy/physiology and understands how the body and mind work together to create new neuromuscular pathways in order to learn and master smooth and consistent movements...in this case, a simple, repeatable golf swing.  It is one thing to understand all of this and something entirely different to be able to put this knowledge to use. Dr Golfshock has figured out how to bring all this together with a progression of simple yet effective drills that make it easy for anyone to improve their swing and golf game.  Dr. Golfshock's methods do not require hours at the driving range, the simplicity is that many of the drills can be done in the home or office using a simple club shaft.  I am not a golf pro, far from it.  By following this video and simply using the drills over the winter, in my home I didn't have the usual rust to shake off in the spring.  With Dr. Golfshock's instruction I hit the ground running and feel I am hitting the ball more consistently and with more accuracy than my last game in the fall!",1402358400,3,1128,4.5594059405940595
8648723,5,B00J8ADGSQ,"Dr. Golfshocks DVD is like no other golf instruction that I have ever seen.  Richard Olshock has explored and analyzed the golf swing in an amazingly insightful way.  His combination of human body knowledge along with being an excellent player himself produced a set of simple common-sense principles that I can practice at home and at the driving range.  Until now, I had no idea what the muscles were doing during the swing.  And now, these principles can be used to simplify my swing and make it more repeatable.  This DVD is a must for anyone who is serious about wanting to improve their game, or for the beginner who wants to learn the game in a new unique way.",1398902400,,667,4.525
