7929258,3,B000050Y73,"Even though this came out way before, it is Definitely not as good as Martin Scorsese's ""Bob Dylan: No Direction Home."" I gave it 3 stars because it is Bob Dylan and it goes further up into the 90s. Also, the cover photo is nice. But there wasn't any music from Dylan used. That I remember anyways. I don't watch it that often. I've read reviews (on Amazon) that read it wasn't that great, but I still bought it anyways. I don't regret buying it. If you're Bob Dylan fan, I still think it's something you should own. BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY ""NO DIRECTION HOME,"" ...",1415664000,,568,4.317757009345795

7929262,1,B000050Y73,"Sickening!  This was about 90% boring talking heads, 9% still photo's of Hibbing, Minnesota, and 1% Dylan footage.  More Dylan, less fillin'!",978134400,22,141,5.363636363636363
