1357688,5,B00004VVN5,"Clint Eastwood has a wide range of acting capability. IN this collection which includes: The Beguiled, Bronco Billy, Dirty Harry, In the Line of  Fire, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and Unforgiven many of those abilities are  represented.  To answer comments below, I see Hang m High and many other  of Clint's westerns on TBS - - they love them too. But this collection has  ones that are not commonly seen: The Beguiled - - is a wonderful eerie  western. Bronco Billy - - Clint with a sense of humor and circus  entertainment.  Dirty Harry - - the odes of a 44. magnum.  In the Line of  Fire -- great flick with John Malcavich playing a presidential assasin and  Eastwood a special agent guarding the president.  UNFORGIVEN - - a retired  gunslinger is called upon to target two men who slashed a woman. It's not  comedy but great story: Gene Hackman plays a proud sherrif. Great cast!  Terrific collection.",967766400,24,903,4.6265822784810124

1357757,5,B00004VVN5,"I've read some reviews complaining of the dialogue not being in sync with the films and comparing the dialogue track to those in Godzilla films, etc.

 Well, folks, these here are ""Spaghetti Westerns"" (except for Hang 'Em High) and most of the original dialogue was in Italian. So the English dialogue never did sync up with the actors who weren't speaking English.  The English dialogue is overdubbed and, being two different languages, more often than not they don't quite sync up.

Folks would be less prone to give bad reviews if they actually knew what they were talking about, I figure.

As for the DVDs themselves, mine has zero defects, played perfectly, had excellent quality picture and sound and were 100% the genuine article.

Great anti-Western stories, great costumes and tons on manly gore-filled gunfights makes this a collection any Spaghetti Western or Clint Eastwood fans simply MUST own! Great stuff!",1508284800,2,920,5.059602649006623

What a hoot....can't say enough about those good ole ""spaghetti westerns"".  I was a teeny bopper then; and, I can tell you I miss those days and nights at the picture show.  I truly feel sad for those who didn't experience that kinda movie...They can use all the trickery, gadgets, and computer-enhanced imagery they want these days.  But, it'll never replace the acting, writing, and cinematography of these great flicks.... Never....and all 4 that really skyrocketed Clint into fame..But, he really didn't need these to make him famous.  Hell, he was Rowdy Yates...and for 10 bucks?

And I think I only saw two or three growing up in the 60-70's. Have one to go and the first three played just fine. Sound seem off but again that's dating it. I'd love to find an updated sound to the music because it can be a bit strange. Still these were classified as grade B's and made in Spain I think it was and oh yeah no side info or goodies for the most part. Though I myself wouldn't have bought these old goodies or not...I have watched them with husband just cause. Sometimes a bit graphic and UGLY...and oh my are you sure that was the GOOD...but overall not so BAD? Oh yeah BAD.,1479859200,3,709,4.035460992907802

1358203,4,B00004VVN5,"Contrary to some reviews here that misidentify its contents, this 4-DVD set, entitled, ""The Clint Eastwood Collection"" features the following films: A Fistfull of Dollars; For a Few Dollars More; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; and Hang 'em High. The DVD case cover artwork consists of a photo of Clint Eastwood with hat, pancho, and cigar against a yellow-orange with the set's title in large white lettering. Not remastered to flawless perfection by MGM/UA/Fox by any stretch, but great entertainment for the price under $10. Hang 'em High is presented in full screen, while the other three are wide screen in letterbox format. Fun to watch these classics, if you do not mind a few unremastered film effects, particularly on For a Few Dollars More, but not so much an issue on the other three. I recommend this set, especially at less than $10. Would pay twice that or more, if fully remastered.",1421798400,89,898,4.8

1358236,5,B00004VVN5,"I can't quite decipher the complaints about this set.  Some of Eastwood's greatest movies are collected here, or at least some of his most interesting.  ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""Dirty Harry"" are considered classics of their kind.  ""Bronco Billy"" is an oddity, sure, but one of Eastwood's most unusal, and sweetest, films.  ""The Beguiled"" is a fascinating Gothic mood piece, almost a Tennessee Williams exercise about sexual repression and jealousy, set in a most unlikely time and place.  ""Unforgiven"" is one of a tiny handful of truly great American films released during the past 15 years, and perhaps the most potent examination of violence since ""The Wild Bunch.""  And ""The Outlaw - Josey Wales"" may just be Eastwood's best film.  It's got an epic sweep, wonderful characters, terrific performances, and shows an almost incredible grasp of the camera for a man who, at the time (1976) had only directed a couple of movies.",1029110400,4,928,4.948387096774193
1358237,4,B00004VVN5,"I like Clint Eastwood both as an actor and as a director. Collection presented in this box set only touches his real genius. This is a great way to make you buy the movies that you really don't want to own. I'm more of his western part fan and I would prefer to see more such movies put in (accutally it does exists as a separate set). But if you are die hard Clint fan you would have to buy the unwanted movies anyhow so it's all good. Good set, nicely done with many options. Before you buy it just make sure that you really like all the movies.",1003449600,2,547,4.027522935779817
