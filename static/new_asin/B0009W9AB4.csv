8067962,1,B0009W9AB4,"This is unbelievable. I should have read the reviews because I see one with the same problem I have!!
This DVD doesn't work on either of my DVD players at home, nor on the one in my classroom. I really wanted to show this movie to my class since I'm a third grade teacher and we read the book. What a disappointment. The reason for the delay is that I didn't try playing it until today since we just finished the book in class.
I think I should get a refund. I'll just have to throw this away and that is disappointing.",1496880000,,519,4.098039215686274
