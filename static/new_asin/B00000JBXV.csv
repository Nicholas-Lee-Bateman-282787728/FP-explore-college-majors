7911919,5,B00000JBXV,"Silverhawks was one of the best 80's seruesm next to Transformers and Thundercats.  I love the music, especially when Bluegrass starts wailing on his guitar.  This episode is one of the best.  Mon-star is trying to steal gold and this time he has a weapon the Silverhawks might not be able to beat.  The tension is great as the Silverhawks try to battle a ray that can turn them into dinnerwear!",970099200,,395,4.52112676056338
