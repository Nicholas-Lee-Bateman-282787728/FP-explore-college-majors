The DVD sets that I found were all pretty expensive, and then I found this little gem. The fact that it has War in The Pocket is icing on the cake.
In my opinion watching stuff like this on old video tapes is so much more fun, really gives you that old throwback feel. It has fantastic video quality and audio. Now I know why Gai Daigoji loved his old tapes so much. (wow let's see if anyone gets that reference)",1391385600,2,517,4.078431372549019
7910461,5,B00000IBOD,"Gundam animation series has been around for more than decades. I was a huge fan of it when I was growing up. Fortunately, I was able to hear about this newer series of Gundam recently and decided to try it. I loved it. It  was very entertaining itself but also it brought all the nostalgia of my  childhood. However, this series is for mature audiences since it containes  a heaviely political and dramatic story line. It is quite hard to believe  that these visually beautiful animation was actually produced about a  decade ago. I believe this animation series containes the serious and  original atmosphere of the Gundam series not like those new series such as  gundam wings. Regardless of the fact that you know about Gundam or not, you  will be highly entertained.",962064000,,770,4.7368421052631575

7910463,5,B00000IBOD,"For anyone that loves animation, be it Disney or Anime, this collection is a milestone. Stunning scenes, fast-paced action, deep-reaching story background, and superb storytelling. The box contains 6 tapes (not 4), two  are the four episodes of Gundam 0080, the other four contain the 13  episodes of Gundam 0083. The quality is excellent, audio is HI-FI and the  subtitles are state-of-the-art.
The story:  If you have seen the classic  0079 series, then you are at home here, if you doesn't, buy the 3-movies  box at Amazon, and get you up-to-date. Mobile Suit Gundam is definitely not  for children, unless you want to teach them what war means. You will not  find hyper-villans here, and the heroes are not so cristalline. Anyone has  a personal history, and in his prospective he is perfectly right in what he  is doing, and even the 'good-ones' have black spots.  The mobile suits  (robots, if you prefer) are simply machines, that need ammunition, energy,  have a mass, broke up, unlike immortal Mazingas or Goldrakes. The story is  about people, about ideals, about the atrocity of war.
Gundam 0080 is  about a kid, fascinated by mobile suits, that gets involved in a minor  skirmish, and tells how this changes him and his perception of the war.  Simply touching.
Gundam 0083 is a epic story, you cannot even figure what  is to happen at any minute. Here are seen the gigantic space colonies, in  all their massive size, along that tiny starships and mobile suits. Great  characters, great story, and an astonishing gran-finale.
Simply put, once  you seen one, you'll want to have 'm all.",933897600,9,1597,4.862453531598513
