2946366,5,B000VS6R3A,"Rawhide is by far the best of all the TV westerns.  The only one with this much gritty, trail-weary realism -- and with the superb Eric Fleming, who leads the drive in the role of trailboss Gil Favor. For the Eastwood fans, there's the opportunity to not only watch their hero in the role that made him famous, but also to watch him develop a character over the long term.  His Rowdy Yates character never ceased to evolve throughout Rawhide's long run.  And this set contains some of the series' best episodes -- made when the show had truly hit its stride, when the characters had been fully fleshed out, and before the series had lost Sheb Wooley as trail scout Pete Nolan.  In short, buy this -- You won't be sorry you did.  There's only one warning that should be given to those unfamiliar with Rawhide:  This series is highly addictive.",1192752000,10,842,4.506578947368421
2946367,1,B000VS6R3A,"Fans of Gunsmoke and Rawhide etc. love the shows and would be more willing buyers of ""complete"" seasons. Wild, Wild West is just one example (Paramount) of COMPLETE seasons being released at 1300 - 1400 minutes per season
for $35.00-$37.00. Season 1 of Gunsmoke was released complete. The price tag on Gunsmoke Season 2 Volume 1 (525 minutes) is almost as much as the complete 1st season...ridiculous.
  It's called marketing ""bait"" and only a fool would bite. The buying public dictates through their wallets and buying habits what will be released. Make it clear to Paramount/CBS home entertainment (and others!) that enough is enough...Demand complete seasons, otherwise DON'T BUY/PATRONIZE! They WILL listen if the cash register doesn't ring.

2946368,5,B000VS6R3A,"I can't wait to get my hands on volume 2 of season 2 of the finest ever western series RAWHIDE. It will be great to have pristine quality prints of each episode and to see Eric Fleming as tough as nails Trail Boss- Gil Favor. There's never been anyone close to him. I don't think the price is high at all. I live in the U.K. and it costs more for me to order it  in from the USA- it's worth every cent ( penny in U.K) I really do hope they release every season. They will providing all the true fans get out there and buy it. If you don't buy it we won't see more will we? The trouble with reviewers telling us not to buy,it just to complain is that they are not grasping the solid fact that to do  so will stop the release of further Rawhide sets, we, Rawhide true fans can't do that- we want these sets asap, and they are such good value for money no matter what others say, compare these prices to the old video, 2 episodes at a time and much, much more expensive. Let's be grateful for these releases, let's support them and keep 'em coming, I want to see all 8 seasons of Rawhide asap , so let's get out there and buy these  sets of this terific show.

Outstanding western series! Keep them coming Paramount! It's true that Gil and Rowdy rule and Rawhide is #1!

episodes for the second half of Season 2 are
39. Incident at Tinker's Dam (2/5/1960)
40. Incident of the Night Horse (2/19/1960)
41. Incident of the Sharpshooter (2/26/1960)
42. Incident of the Dust Flower (3/4/1960)
43. Incident at Sulphur Creek (3/11/1960)

53. Incident of the Last Chance (6/10/1960)
54. Incident of the Garden of Eden (6/17/1960)

All episodes are excellent. Some early highlight include Night Horse which is packed with action from both man and beast! Sharpshooter is a timeless classic.
After so much waiting and the cruel betrayal of Columbia House, who had started making DVDs available in 2003, uncut and in series order but then abruptly stopped August 2004, Parmount has come to the rescue!
Eric Fleming is amazing as Gil Favor in this seris, there's no one else like him.  Rowdy is also incredible in this series. The details of the old west in this series are fantastic. They don't make anything like it nowadays and we'll probably never see anything like it again.
Thank you Paramount!

Here's a great editorial review for Rawhide below

Like anyone growing up in the late fifties and early sixties I watched as much television as possible. Remember that this was the era of the eleven inch, black and white screen, the single three inch speaker and the universal remote was the youngest family member who had to get up to turn the knobs. This was also the golden years of television. The series that were around back then created the genres that are still around decades later. There was also something special about TV back then, it was the era of the western. Every single boy had a cowboy hat, boots and play six shooter. Even the girls refused to be left out and clamored for a fringe skirt cowgirl outfit and hat. The vast majority of television programming was dedicated to the American old west. Every network, all three of them, filled their schedules with one variation of the theme after another. Most of those series are now only a small footnote in the history of television. Several remain today as cult classics and the undisputed leaders in this field. After `Gunsmoke' one TV western still stands above the rest `Rawhide'. This was `THE' show to watch back then. We kids would put on our cowboy gear, make the coffee table into a covered wagon and sit there mesmerized by the action. This is more than an old television show; for many of us this is a piece of our personal history.
The folks over at Paramount Pictures have the most incredible vault of classic television series imaginable. Anybody would love to be able to sit there for a month or two watching the myriad of shows they have on tap. Since this is not a likely prospect it is very fortunate that Paramount has been in a sharing mood. Lately they have been bringing out DVD set after set of series from these golden years. Now they have the second volume of the second season and like the previous ones, it is fantastic. The thing about `Rawhide' is it may have been one of the most famous television westerns but it was not very typical of the genre. Most westerns had the required action. There were good guys with white hats and bad one wearing black and the Native Americans, `Indians' back then, where rarely more than savages. Rawhide took a different slant. It was a dramatic series that just happened to be set in the old west. The six-shooter was there but not as important as the moral and emotional dilemmas the characters faced each week. The stories were centered on the characters over mindless action. It was possible to do this back then. Now so much of television has degenerated into mindless pap that it is easy to forget just how powerful this medium is. In those days everything was new and the studios were willing to take a chance. Rawhide stands the test of time because it dared to be different. So bring in the youngsters and let them see television the way it was meant to be. If they complain just make them stand behind the TV holding a set of rabbit ear antennas like we had to.
The premise of the series is elegant in its simplicity following the lives a group of cowboys working on a cattle drive. Many westerns showed cowboys riding around, shooing cattle now and again but it always felt like the cowpokes really didn't have a whole lot to do. This series depicted the arduous struggle to move a heard of cattle from one location to another. It was a daily hardship battling the weather, rustlers, the cattle and even each other. The drama of the series came organically from the realism of the characters and stories. These were the kind of men that built the west. At the head of the chain of command is Gil Favor (Eric Fleming), the trail boss. He is the one in command of the drovers and support staff on the drive. He is a man who has been around and seen it all. Although he is grizzled and tough he is also fair. His right hand man is Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood), the ramrod. It is up to him to work along side the men making sure they do things right. While the men keep the cattle in line it is up to Rowdy to keep them moving in the right direction. Also in constant attendance is Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) the camp cook. He you are responsible for providing a group of hungry cowboys with chow you have to be ready for just about anything. He depends on his assistant Mushy (James Murdock). One of the senior wranglers is Hey Soos (Robert Cabal) he is not a stranger to getting into trouble. Usually there to scout out the land ahead is Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley).
This series doesn't look or feel like a television show at all. It is more like short, 50 minute, movies. The production quality here is spectacular. There is more emphasis on the plot than action. The fight scenes are just a small part of the series and this set it apart from the large pack of westerns back then. Life on a long cattle drive was shown in a realistic fashion. On such a trek boredom was the real enemy. Cowpokes looking for some excitement on their down time would head off to the nearest town and typically get into some mess or another. There are also plenty of slice of life shots. In one the men side around the chuck wagon, the center of cattle drive society, and grab a snack, mend their clothes, get in a snooze or tend to their saddles. These quite times were usually disrupted by some form of mayhem. Either it is a group of cattle rustlers out to steal the heard or an Indiana attack that forces the cowboys into action. Each episode was titles `Incident at ...' which is extremely fitting. These stories are notable incidents on an otherwise routine cattle drive.
Every episode begins with Gil waxing philosophically about some aspect of his line of work. Whether it is how the good Lord swells a little stream so it takes days to cross or the economics of bringing in the heard on time and in sellable shape Gil gets to show off his deeper side. This was also the series that made a star out of Clint Eastwood. He is more than an actor; he is a true renaissance man who has achieved fame as an actor, director, jazz musician, composer and even a politician. This is where it all began for him. He could stare down the meanest bad guy with a single stare and if necessary back it up with his six-shooter. Also gaining a good deal of fame here was the singer of the theme song, Frankie Lane. This song has lived on long after the series was cancelled and is known throughout the world.
Paramount certainly took care of the original elements of this series. The black and white full screen video is incredibly clear. There is a little speck every so often but over all the video is excellent. This is better than I remember the show ever being. the Dolby 2.0 mono is clear and without flaw. These episodes are completely re-mastered and it shows. Typical of an older television set for Paramount there are no extras included. That really doesn't matter here; the series is a great buy on its own. This is a must have for everyone that appreciates quality television.",1189296000,35,8595,4.560517799352751

2946412,5,B000VS6R3A,"recently i purchased the ""Rawhide-The second Season, Vol. 2 "".  My Goal is to buy the early years.  The latter
years, I record off Encore Westerns, Mon-Fri. In fact, Encore westerns, state that these are ""lost episodes"", which is great for the watchers.  I have been recording since Jan. 2012, without fail. I like the series so much, that I ordered Season 1-3.  I enjoy the Dvd's, because u can sit & watch as many episodes at a time as you want. When I record,
off Encore Westerns, I also record the line-up of HGWT, Wagon Train, Gunsmoke and Rawhide 5 days a week. So, thats great when u want to watch, a variety of western programming, at a time.  If I use the slowest speed when I record, I can get 2 days in at a time.. 8hrs. All these programs, are completely new to my husband & me.  As far as the picture quality on The Rawhide Dvd's, It gets a ""C"" to me.  I would think they could so some remastering there. I have also bought Gunsmoke, which is put out by the same company, and the video is absolutely perfect. So, I don't know why the Rawhide Dvd's are substandered to me...especially, since, they're black & white as well. Also, on a positive note, The Rawhide Dvd's are closed captioned, which is absolutely wonderful for the hearing impaired. My
husband is very thankful for them, since he has a profound hearing loss. I know alot of us that hear, don't think too much of closed captioned, because, we hear just fine. Although, 48 million Americans, are hearing impaired. I just learned  that other day, directly from this closed caption company, that does cc for the movies.  Oh by the way, if someone doesn't speak english, they can take advantage of these Dvd's as well...They don't need sub-titles...just as long as they have cc activated on their televisions...real simple.",1343606400,2,1793,4.543478260869565

This TV series is one of the best I've ever seen. Eric Fleming brought a lot to this series, as did his young costar Clint Eastwood, along with a very able supporting cast. Some of the stories are very fresh and creative, and even the more traditional plots are done very well. Season 2 (32 episodes) has a surprising number of stories dealing with the supernatural, with almost a Twilight Zone feel. Some of the villains are females and they are very good at being very bad.",1293062400,,657,4.385245901639344
2946416,4,B000VS6R3A,"This classic television series holds up quite well, all things considering and especially in comparison with later products like The Wild Wild West, which were very obviously shot on back-lots or locations in the near vicinity of Griffith Park. No expense seems to have been spared for ""Rawhide"" as regards to locations, props and the essential livestock. It became a bit of a joke later on, for TV westerns to be ostensibly set on a cattle ranch with never a cow actually to be seen, but this series managed to escape that ""stock"" situation. Just as well, considering that it was supposed to take place during a cattle drive from Texas to rail heads in Kansas just after the Civil War, and the movement of a large group of cattle is absolutely central to much of the various episode plots. Quite a lot of action takes place out of doors, on horseback and in conjunction with the aforementioned herd of cattle, and such location shoots are integrated fairly seamlessly with the sound-staged moments. Oddly enough, the fact that it is in black and white lends something of an air of realism to the show; everyone generally appears authentically grubby, sweaty and hard-working.

The episodes contained in this four-disc collection were originally broadcast in 1960. In many ways the show is in peak form; the characters of tough and gritty trail boss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) and his drovers are well-enough developed, but not yet worn out. There are all kinds of fresh angles to find out about the characters - Wishbone the cook (Paul Brinegar),  Pete Nolan (Sheb Woolley) and cowhand Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood - yes, that Clint Eastwood). Eastwood is not actually the top bill in the series credits - the appearance of the box cover art to the contrary. Eric Fleming was very much the series star; the series was canceled very shortly after he departed the show in the mid 1960s. While watching this series, my daughter and I wondered why we had never seen him in anything else; he played an immensely likable and complicated character, and the show was popular all during its' eight season run.

2946418,5,B000VS6R3A,"CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""RAWHIDE: SECOND SEASON VOL TWO"" (5 February 1960 - 17 June 1960) (822 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.

The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.

Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine. The theme song became very popular --- It was covered several times and parts of the song also appear in more recent movies like The Blues Brothers and Shrek.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

2946419,5,B000VS6R3A,"I waited years to get my hands on the complete series' of this all time great western series RAWHIDE. Eric Fleming was a great star and actor. I understand that HE was the original one who was asaked to play ""The man with no name"" - he passed on it and handed it to Clint to see if it interested him - the rest is history. Of course this was a few more years down the line, there are many more great episodes and seasons to enjoy yet. Can't wait to get my hands on season 3. It's a bit of a shame that Clint is given the highlight on the covers when to be honest it was Eric Flemings AND Clint's show ... in that order.",1209168000,5,619,3.8818897637795278

The singing of the song by Frankie Laine and the score being presented by Dmitri Tonkin of High Noon fame is of the highest quality. The picture and sound is great.

2946422,4,B000VS6R3A,"Rawhide was one of the best western tv series of the late 50's early 60's.
The only reason I rated this dvd 4 stars rather than 5, is because of
greedy Paramount Studios who see a chance to gouge fans by putting only half a season of shows on their disc and charging the same price. The
remastering and sound were excellent.",1202515200,,324,4.241935483870968
2946423,4,B000VS6R3A,"I was thrilled with the earlier releases, and the studio has continued to do a great job of transferring the series to dvd cleanly and with good sound. I am elated to see shows from my childhood that I haven't seen since their original air dates. For the quality and the thrill of seeing old favorites I would give this release 5 stars. On the minus side there are no special features, plus this and other studios have started to break up seasons into multiple volumes. For that they earn 3 stars, averaging to 4 stars. I also doubt I will buy any further seasons of Rawhide due to the cost.",1200960000,2,591,4.333333333333333

I can attest that this series will be in my posession a lot longer than a tank of gas in my truck & I'll for sure get much more enjoyment from it. :D

As always, I love the series & am thankful that it's being released for my (our) enjoyment. Thank you, Paramount & keep 'em commin!!",1198195200,13,468,4.142857142857143
2946426,5,B000VS6R3A,Impressed with Rawhide! I'm buying this for myself and several more as Christmas gifts including the second season 2 pack! Highly recommended! The first season and the first installment of the second season had me sold! I'm eagerly waiting for season 3 now!,1198022400,9,257,5.0

But something good, something excellent is well worth waiting for!  After watching the first season I realised how really great early tv was, well some of it that is...and Rawhide was one.  Season 2 both volumes are fantastic...again the biggest disappointment is the produces discison to break up the seasons into 2 charging the same as for one. If I didn't want it so bad that would have stopped me...in fact I might not buy anymore after this because of that!",1194220800,4,629,4.598214285714286

I'm just thrilled that Paramount is making Rawhide available again in all its glory. I hope Paramount keeps rollin', rollin', rollin' the seasons out as soon as possible until I can finally have the complete set of the series.  But they better hurry up.  After all, many potential customers who saw Rawhide when it was first broadcast may start dying off soon.  Roll 'em out, Paramount, please!",1193961600,16,536,4.589473684210526

Rawhide was one of the best western series for television and it sure deserved 5 stars... but not the product released by greedy Paramount. For it, only 1 star, nothing else. Two volumes for a complete season 2 at $38.99 each (official price) means $ 77.98 for a single season! This is a very high price...and ridiculous too! Paramount is not doing right with the Rawhide series. Why so much focus on Clint Eastwood for the box covers? Eric Fleming was the real star of Rawhide and he is always ""small and in the background"" on the boxes! I understand Clint is famous today, and Eric Fleming is almost forgotten, but he was the main character in Rawhide, and, at the time, a better actor than Eastwood. At least Paramount should give both of them equal focus. Indeed, Rawhide is a great show poorly released by Paramount!",1193356800,16,892,4.445121951219512
2946430,5,B000VS6R3A,"In looking at the reviews posted so far (8), I notice that 4 have given Season2 Part 2 a 5-star rating, the other 4 have given it 1-star.  And the distinction is clear:  all those who think the $35 for 1/2 season is too pricey give it 1;  those who think it is worth it, give it 5. But I guessing all would agree that this is one of the best Western series of all time. This was a great series, Season 2 contains some of the very best episodes of the 8 seasons,and fans of Clint Eastwood will enjoy watching him in the early stages of his acting career, growing in his role as Rowdy Yates.  If you want to see wonderful TV Western stories, for about $2.20 per episode, this is a perfect choice.  If you don't want to pay that much, wait and hope the price comes down.  But it could be long wait.",1193011200,10,795,4.031847133757962

I bought the first season the day it was released, but unfortunately I won't be buying any more until Paramont stops being so greedy.  $70 for a full season?  Ridiculous!  They're doing the same with Gunsmoke.  Give fans the full seasons for a reasonable price and I'll purchase every season of both Rawhide and Gunsmoke.  Until then, Paramont won't be getting any of my money.  These are both great series, don't let the greedy suits a Paramont rip us off!",1192752000,11,523,4.559139784946237
3180863,5,B000VS6R3A,"Rawhide is by far the best of all the TV westerns.  The only one with this much gritty, trail-weary realism -- and with the superb Eric Fleming, who leads the drive in the role of trailboss Gil Favor. For the Eastwood fans, there's the opportunity to not only watch their hero in the role that made him famous, but also to watch him develop a character over the long term.  His Rowdy Yates character never ceased to evolve throughout Rawhide's long run.  And this set contains some of the series' best episodes -- made when the show had truly hit its stride, when the characters had been fully fleshed out, and before the series had lost Sheb Wooley as trail scout Pete Nolan.  In short, buy this -- You won't be sorry you did.  There's only one warning that should be given to those unfamiliar with Rawhide:  This series is highly addictive.",1192752000,10,842,4.506578947368421
3180864,1,B000VS6R3A,"Fans of Gunsmoke and Rawhide etc. love the shows and would be more willing buyers of ""complete"" seasons. Wild, Wild West is just one example (Paramount) of COMPLETE seasons being released at 1300 - 1400 minutes per season
for $35.00-$37.00. Season 1 of Gunsmoke was released complete. The price tag on Gunsmoke Season 2 Volume 1 (525 minutes) is almost as much as the complete 1st season...ridiculous.
  It's called marketing ""bait"" and only a fool would bite. The buying public dictates through their wallets and buying habits what will be released. Make it clear to Paramount/CBS home entertainment (and others!) that enough is enough...Demand complete seasons, otherwise DON'T BUY/PATRONIZE! They WILL listen if the cash register doesn't ring.

It will be great to have pristine quality prints of each episode and to see Eric Fleming as tough as nails Trail Boss- Gil Favor. There's never been anyone close to him. I don't think the price is high at all. I live in the U.K. and it costs more for me to order it  in from the USA- it's worth every cent ( penny in U.K) I really do hope they release every season. They will providing all the true fans get out there and buy it. If you don't buy it we won't see more will we? The trouble with reviewers telling us not to buy,it just to complain is that they are not grasping the solid fact that to do  so will stop the release of further Rawhide sets, we, Rawhide true fans can't do that- we want these sets asap, and they are such good value for money no matter what others say, compare these prices to the old video, 2 episodes at a time and much, much more expensive. Let's be grateful for these releases, let's support them and keep 'em coming, I want to see all 8 seasons of Rawhide asap , so let's get out there and buy these  sets of this terific show.

54. Incident of the Garden of Eden (6/17/1960)

All episodes are excellent. Some early highlight include Night Horse which is packed with action from both man and beast! Sharpshooter is a timeless classic.
After so much waiting and the cruel betrayal of Columbia House, who had started making DVDs available in 2003, uncut and in series order but then abruptly stopped August 2004, Parmount has come to the rescue!
Eric Fleming is amazing as Gil Favor in this seris, there's no one else like him.  Rowdy is also incredible in this series. The details of the old west in this series are fantastic. They don't make anything like it nowadays and we'll probably never see anything like it again.
Thank you Paramount!

Here's a great editorial review for Rawhide below

Like anyone growing up in the late fifties and early sixties I watched as much television as possible. Remember that this was the era of the eleven inch, black and white screen, the single three inch speaker and the universal remote was the youngest family member who had to get up to turn the knobs. This was also the golden years of television. The series that were around back then created the genres that are still around decades later. There was also something special about TV back then, it was the era of the western. Every single boy had a cowboy hat, boots and play six shooter. Even the girls refused to be left out and clamored for a fringe skirt cowgirl outfit and hat. The vast majority of television programming was dedicated to the American old west. Every network, all three of them, filled their schedules with one variation of the theme after another. Most of those series are now only a small footnote in the history of television. Several remain today as cult classics and the undisputed leaders in this field. After `Gunsmoke' one TV western still stands above the rest `Rawhide'. This was `THE' show to watch back then. We kids would put on our cowboy gear, make the coffee table into a covered wagon and sit there mesmerized by the action. This is more than an old television show; for many of us this is a piece of our personal history.
The folks over at Paramount Pictures have the most incredible vault of classic television series imaginable. Anybody would love to be able to sit there for a month or two watching the myriad of shows they have on tap. Since this is not a likely prospect it is very fortunate that Paramount has been in a sharing mood. Lately they have been bringing out DVD set after set of series from these golden years. Now they have the second volume of the second season and like the previous ones, it is fantastic. The thing about `Rawhide' is it may have been one of the most famous television westerns but it was not very typical of the genre. Most westerns had the required action. There were good guys with white hats and bad one wearing black and the Native Americans, `Indians' back then, where rarely more than savages. Rawhide took a different slant. It was a dramatic series that just happened to be set in the old west. The six-shooter was there but not as important as the moral and emotional dilemmas the characters faced each week. The stories were centered on the characters over mindless action. It was possible to do this back then. Now so much of television has degenerated into mindless pap that it is easy to forget just how powerful this medium is. In those days everything was new and the studios were willing to take a chance. Rawhide stands the test of time because it dared to be different. So bring in the youngsters and let them see television the way it was meant to be. If they complain just make them stand behind the TV holding a set of rabbit ear antennas like we had to.
The premise of the series is elegant in its simplicity following the lives a group of cowboys working on a cattle drive. Many westerns showed cowboys riding around, shooing cattle now and again but it always felt like the cowpokes really didn't have a whole lot to do. This series depicted the arduous struggle to move a heard of cattle from one location to another. It was a daily hardship battling the weather, rustlers, the cattle and even each other. The drama of the series came organically from the realism of the characters and stories. These were the kind of men that built the west. At the head of the chain of command is Gil Favor (Eric Fleming), the trail boss. He is the one in command of the drovers and support staff on the drive. He is a man who has been around and seen it all. Although he is grizzled and tough he is also fair. His right hand man is Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood), the ramrod. It is up to him to work along side the men making sure they do things right. While the men keep the cattle in line it is up to Rowdy to keep them moving in the right direction. Also in constant attendance is Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) the camp cook. He you are responsible for providing a group of hungry cowboys with chow you have to be ready for just about anything. He depends on his assistant Mushy (James Murdock). One of the senior wranglers is Hey Soos (Robert Cabal) he is not a stranger to getting into trouble. Usually there to scout out the land ahead is Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley).
This series doesn't look or feel like a television show at all. It is more like short, 50 minute, movies. The production quality here is spectacular. There is more emphasis on the plot than action. The fight scenes are just a small part of the series and this set it apart from the large pack of westerns back then. Life on a long cattle drive was shown in a realistic fashion. On such a trek boredom was the real enemy. Cowpokes looking for some excitement on their down time would head off to the nearest town and typically get into some mess or another. There are also plenty of slice of life shots. In one the men side around the chuck wagon, the center of cattle drive society, and grab a snack, mend their clothes, get in a snooze or tend to their saddles. These quite times were usually disrupted by some form of mayhem. Either it is a group of cattle rustlers out to steal the heard or an Indiana attack that forces the cowboys into action. Each episode was titles `Incident at ...' which is extremely fitting. These stories are notable incidents on an otherwise routine cattle drive.
Every episode begins with Gil waxing philosophically about some aspect of his line of work. Whether it is how the good Lord swells a little stream so it takes days to cross or the economics of bringing in the heard on time and in sellable shape Gil gets to show off his deeper side. This was also the series that made a star out of Clint Eastwood. He is more than an actor; he is a true renaissance man who has achieved fame as an actor, director, jazz musician, composer and even a politician. This is where it all began for him. He could stare down the meanest bad guy with a single stare and if necessary back it up with his six-shooter. Also gaining a good deal of fame here was the singer of the theme song, Frankie Lane. This song has lived on long after the series was cancelled and is known throughout the world.
Paramount certainly took care of the original elements of this series. The black and white full screen video is incredibly clear. There is a little speck every so often but over all the video is excellent. This is better than I remember the show ever being. the Dolby 2.0 mono is clear and without flaw. These episodes are completely re-mastered and it shows. Typical of an older television set for Paramount there are no extras included. That really doesn't matter here; the series is a great buy on its own. This is a must have for everyone that appreciates quality television.",1189296000,35,8595,4.560517799352751

3180909,5,B000VS6R3A,"recently i purchased the ""Rawhide-The second Season, Vol. 2 "".  My Goal is to buy the early years.  The latter
years, I record off Encore Westerns, Mon-Fri. In fact, Encore westerns, state that these are ""lost episodes"", which is great for the watchers.  I have been recording since Jan. 2012, without fail. I like the series so much, that I ordered Season 1-3.  I enjoy the Dvd's, because u can sit & watch as many episodes at a time as you want. When I record,
off Encore Westerns, I also record the line-up of HGWT, Wagon Train, Gunsmoke and Rawhide 5 days a week. So, thats great when u want to watch, a variety of western programming, at a time.  If I use the slowest speed when I record, I can get 2 days in at a time.. 8hrs. All these programs, are completely new to my husband & me.  As far as the picture quality on The Rawhide Dvd's, It gets a ""C"" to me.  I would think they could so some remastering there. I have also bought Gunsmoke, which is put out by the same company, and the video is absolutely perfect. So, I don't know why the Rawhide Dvd's are substandered to me...especially, since, they're black & white as well. Also, on a positive note, The Rawhide Dvd's are closed captioned, which is absolutely wonderful for the hearing impaired. My
husband is very thankful for them, since he has a profound hearing loss. I know alot of us that hear, don't think too much of closed captioned, because, we hear just fine. Although, 48 million Americans, are hearing impaired. I just learned  that other day, directly from this closed caption company, that does cc for the movies.  Oh by the way, if someone doesn't speak english, they can take advantage of these Dvd's as well...They don't need sub-titles...just as long as they have cc activated on their televisions...real simple.",1343606400,2,1793,4.543478260869565

3180912,5,B000VS6R3A,"Somehow I missed this exciting western when it was on television in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I am glad that I did, since I now have a new western television series to watch.

This TV series is one of the best I've ever seen. Eric Fleming brought a lot to this series, as did his young costar Clint Eastwood, along with a very able supporting cast. Some of the stories are very fresh and creative, and even the more traditional plots are done very well. Season 2 (32 episodes) has a surprising number of stories dealing with the supernatural, with almost a Twilight Zone feel. Some of the villains are females and they are very good at being very bad.",1293062400,,657,4.385245901639344
3180913,4,B000VS6R3A,"This classic television series holds up quite well, all things considering and especially in comparison with later products like The Wild Wild West, which were very obviously shot on back-lots or locations in the near vicinity of Griffith Park. No expense seems to have been spared for ""Rawhide"" as regards to locations, props and the essential livestock. It became a bit of a joke later on, for TV westerns to be ostensibly set on a cattle ranch with never a cow actually to be seen, but this series managed to escape that ""stock"" situation. Just as well, considering that it was supposed to take place during a cattle drive from Texas to rail heads in Kansas just after the Civil War, and the movement of a large group of cattle is absolutely central to much of the various episode plots. Quite a lot of action takes place out of doors, on horseback and in conjunction with the aforementioned herd of cattle, and such location shoots are integrated fairly seamlessly with the sound-staged moments. Oddly enough, the fact that it is in black and white lends something of an air of realism to the show; everyone generally appears authentically grubby, sweaty and hard-working.

The episodes contained in this four-disc collection were originally broadcast in 1960. In many ways the show is in peak form; the characters of tough and gritty trail boss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) and his drovers are well-enough developed, but not yet worn out. There are all kinds of fresh angles to find out about the characters - Wishbone the cook (Paul Brinegar),  Pete Nolan (Sheb Woolley) and cowhand Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood - yes, that Clint Eastwood). Eastwood is not actually the top bill in the series credits - the appearance of the box cover art to the contrary. Eric Fleming was very much the series star; the series was canceled very shortly after he departed the show in the mid 1960s. While watching this series, my daughter and I wondered why we had never seen him in anything else; he played an immensely likable and complicated character, and the show was popular all during its' eight season run. It turns out that he was drowned in an accident on location for another adventure show within a year or so after leaving the cast of ""Rawhide"".",1243123200,4,2242,4.760925449871466

3180915,5,B000VS6R3A,"CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""RAWHIDE: SECOND SEASON VOL TWO"" (5 February 1960 - 17 June 1960) (822 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.

The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.

Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine. The theme song became very popular --- It was covered several times and parts of the song also appear in more recent movies like The Blues Brothers and Shrek.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

3180916,5,B000VS6R3A,"I waited years to get my hands on the complete series' of this all time great western series RAWHIDE. Eric Fleming was a great star and actor. I understand that HE was the original one who was asaked to play ""The man with no name"" - he passed on it and handed it to Clint to see if it interested him - the rest is history. Of course this was a few more years down the line, there are many more great episodes and seasons to enjoy yet. Can't wait to get my hands on season 3. It's a bit of a shame that Clint is given the highlight on the covers when to be honest it was Eric Flemings AND Clint's show ... in that order.",1209168000,5,619,3.8818897637795278
3180917,4,B000VS6R3A,The first thing to strike you is the great background sound of this program. The singing of the song by Frankie Laine and the score being presented by Dmitri Tonkin of High Noon fame is of the highest quality. The picture and sound is great.

greedy Paramount Studios who see a chance to gouge fans by putting only half a season of shows on their disc and charging the same price. The
remastering and sound were excellent.",1202515200,,324,4.241935483870968

I am elated to see shows from my childhood that I haven't seen since their original air dates. For the quality and the thrill of seeing old favorites I would give this release 5 stars. On the minus side there are no special features, plus this and other studios have started to break up seasons into multiple volumes. For that they earn 3 stars, averaging to 4 stars. I also doubt I will buy any further seasons of Rawhide due to the cost.",1200960000,2,591,4.333333333333333

I can attest that this series will be in my posession a lot longer than a tank of gas in my truck & I'll for sure get much more enjoyment from it. :D

As always, I love the series & am thankful that it's being released for my (our) enjoyment. Thank you, Paramount & keep 'em commin!!",1198195200,13,468,4.142857142857143

But something good, something excellent is well worth waiting for!  After watching the first season I realised how really great early tv was, well some of it that is...and Rawhide was one.  Season 2 both volumes are fantastic...again the biggest disappointment is the produces discison to break up the seasons into 2 charging the same as for one. If I didn't want it so bad that would have stopped me...in fact I might not buy anymore after this because of that!",1194220800,4,629,4.598214285714286

I hope Paramount keeps rollin', rollin', rollin' the seasons out as soon as possible until I can finally have the complete set of the series.  But they better hurry up.  After all, many potential customers who saw Rawhide when it was first broadcast may start dying off soon.  Roll 'em out, Paramount, please!",1193961600,16,536,4.589473684210526
3180926,1,B000VS6R3A,"I could be urged to give 5 stars to this show, but I just can't do it. Rawhide was one of the best western series for television and it sure deserved 5 stars... but not the product released by greedy Paramount. For it, only 1 star, nothing else. Two volumes for a complete season 2 at $38.99 each (official price) means $ 77.98 for a single season! This is a very high price...and ridiculous too! Paramount is not doing right with the Rawhide series. Why so much focus on Clint Eastwood for the box covers? Eric Fleming was the real star of Rawhide and he is always ""small and in the background"" on the boxes! I understand Clint is famous today, and Eric Fleming is almost forgotten, but he was the main character in Rawhide, and, at the time, a better actor than Eastwood. At least Paramount should give both of them equal focus. Indeed, Rawhide is a great show poorly released by Paramount!",1193356800,16,892,4.445121951219512
3180927,5,B000VS6R3A,"In looking at the reviews posted so far (8), I notice that 4 have given Season2 Part 2 a 5-star rating, the other 4 have given it 1-star.  And the distinction is clear:  all those who think the $35 for 1/2 season is too pricey give it 1;  those who think it is worth it, give it 5. But I guessing all would agree that this is one of the best Western series of all time. This was a great series, Season 2 contains some of the very best episodes of the 8 seasons,and fans of Clint Eastwood will enjoy watching him in the early stages of his acting career, growing in his role as Rowdy Yates.  If you want to see wonderful TV Western stories, for about $2.20 per episode, this is a perfect choice.  If you don't want to pay that much, wait and hope the price comes down.  But it could be long wait.",1193011200,10,795,4.031847133757962
3180928,1,B000VS6R3A,"I love this show and couldn't wait until it was released on DVD.  I bought the first season the day it was released, but unfortunately I won't be buying any more until Paramont stops being so greedy.  $70 for a full season?  Ridiculous!  They're doing the same with Gunsmoke.  Give fans the full seasons for a reasonable price and I'll purchase every season of both Rawhide and Gunsmoke.  Until then, Paramont won't be getting any of my money.  These are both great series, don't let the greedy suits a Paramont rip us off!",1192752000,11,523,4.559139784946237

BUT, that bad moment aside the episode still is not a waste as it does get a bit spooky in its attempt to be different from a typically predictable, western tv episode circa 1960.
RAWHIDE has plenty of good episodes to spare highlighted by the non-violent, and or no shootout episodes like ""The Incident of the Dust Flower"" where trail scout Pete Nolan does his best to help a nice spinster lady do the right thing.
Also of note is the not too cute but very good episode starring ""Wishbone"" who meets a good woman and you can't blame him for considering 'settling down' to open a cafe in the ""Incident of the Deserter"" episode.
""Incident of the Last Chance"" also has almost no violence; and revolves around a young, well bred couple from Boston who is assisted by Favor and the drovers after their night of camping is struck by lightening (darn the luck).  The prissy wife loses her clothing in the fire and some pretty obvious maturation (but not as predictable as you might think) is in order for the  newlyweds as they must learn how to handle the rugged west - and themselves (I only had a problem with drunken Indian allowed to pull out his knife - by boss Gil Favor no less.  No worries:  he knew the script).
RAWHIDE SEASON 2 VOLUME 2 continues the western action of a good show by adding second tier characters (drovers), also.  Jesus (Heysoos) is accused of being a witch when he has the chance to go home and see his mom in the ""Incident of the 100 Amulets"" episode.  Yes, ignorance and bigotry in the old west must have had its horrifying, narrow-minded moments.
Great realistic black-and-white footage continues to prevail on the Sedalia Trail.
Sound is good too.
RAWHIDE SEASON 2 VOLUME 2 a very easy 4 star classic tv experience.
Well worth 12 bucks for 16 episodes.
Season 3 is next.",1501977600,,2112,4.513089005235602

8219633,2,B000VS6R3A,"Cannot really review this old TV western with Clint Eastwood, Eric Flemming and James Murdock who played Mushy on Rawhide.  I ordered two sets of season two vols. 1 and 2 for a Muslim friend who loves and watched Rawhide in Pakistan when the show went overseas as a kid and he asked me to buy them for him and then he paid me back.  I remember it was a halfway decent western as there were so many to mention in the period this series came out.  I am only mentioning this as I once worked in a fast food place in Los Angeles in 1962 called the Dog House (a franchise from the International House of Pancakes and for the time I worked there, about six months, every day, Steve McQueen and James Murdock (Mushy on Rawhide) would come in on their motorcycles and drink about ten cups of coffee (5 cents and free refills back then).  Also for those who are not aware, The star of the show, Eric Fleming died in a river accident in the Amazon making a movie.  At the time a story circulated that he was eaten by piranha's, but that has since been disproven.",1466553600,,1052,4.213930348258707
