4210987,5,B003VSL57A,"I first saw ""Candyman"" at this year's (2010) Slamdance Film Festival.  It was standing room only - the entire audience both roaring with laughter and moved to tears following the journey of David Klein's life and career.  That was in January - it's July now, and I haven't been able to shake this delicious documentary film from my candy-loving head.  I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Klein (The Candyman) after the screening and hope to visit his actual candy kitchen soon.  To say David has had his ups and downs is an understatement - this doc shows it all.  And his candy creations - from the ubiquitous Jelly Belly to the more recent Sour Spanks (so sour they'll spank your mouth - and they do) are his life's passion.  This movie's not only a treat for candy lovers, its a moving portrait of one of the most memorable entrepreneurs I've ever seen on film.",1279929600,3,863,4.535483870967742

4211033,1,B003VSL57A,"Just when you think this film is going to turn around and have a happy or (at the very least) redeeming ending, it really doesn't. That could have saved this non-entertaining and non-compelling ""documentary"" from stealing more than an hour of my life. Skip it. Bypass. Look for something else. Don't waste your time. It's a sad waste of bandwidth. Wish it could have been great. I really did. It was the opposite of great. Recommend it to someone you're not crazy about. This ""candy"" made me sick........or at least made me mentally and intellectually barf uncontrollably all over my shoes. Are ya gettin' the message that I wasn't crazy about it?",1453507200,2,647,4.785714285714286
4211034,5,B003VSL57A,Good story about how Jelly Belly jelly beans got its roots. The Jelly Belly Company should tribute the true history even though the Candyman was robbed at pen point.  My family loves those jelly beans.,1453334400,,201,4.742857142857143

4211036,5,B003VSL57A,"Good to know a little more behind the real jelly belly.  A good watch. Could be summed up in 5 minutes but, I felt like I got to know David a little better and how special of a person he is.  Could have been a little shorter and more on what happened to modern Jelly Belly",1453161600,,272,3.8392857142857144
4211037,5,B003VSL57A,"David has a Kickstarter for his new line of Jelly Beans. They are The Original Coffee House Jelly Beans. You can find it by searching on Kickstarter for Candyman.

4211048,3,B003VSL57A,"This doc is a great view of what seems to be an idiot. He goes through all the work to invent, market, publicize, and find a manufacturer of Jelly Belly's. Then when the manufacturer strong arms him into a gypo buyout deal, he folds like a cheap suit and never even consults an attorney. this should be shown in every business class as what not to ever do.",1449014400,,356,4.25
4211049,5,B003VSL57A,"This is a story that is kinda shocking,

Spoiler Alert

This guy is creative and thinks of a great idea, Jelly Belly.  He creates it, creates new flavors, and makes a marketing plan that rockets to success.  But he is a very giving guy, to a fault.  He does not fully protect his IP, and one day his copacker, the people who actually make the product decided to force him to sell for under 1% of what the company is worth, and he already gave away half of it early on to help other people.....so this guy, who should be a huge success, and has helped countless others be a success, is now broke, financially and his ego is crushed.  The first part is really cool but then the twist makes you mad.

This is much like the sriracha story you can see here.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sriracha/dp/B00MLYNYDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sriracha</a>&nbsp;Except david tran kept his company going despite having no IP at all.",1448409600,3,965,5.031446540880503

4211087,4,B003VSL57A,It was interesting.  I felt bad that things turned out the way they did for the inventor of Jelly Bellies.  He certainly was taken advantage of.  I don't think I will buy another Jelly Belly as my own personal protest to the way he was treated.,1441843200,,244,4.260869565217392

After the tour of the warehouse (yes it was like being in Willy Wonkas) I went back to his office to say it was nice meeting him ,  as I l walked away he shouted 'hey ' when I turned back he tossed a stuffed toy monkey to me and said I could have it. It made me happy, I smiled and thanked him . When I told sterling what happened  he smiled  and said everyone  has been asking and wanted that stuffed toy.  ""Monkey "" is still around .  He really did like to make people smile and happy.  I love telling people how I met the inventor of jelly bellys  :)

This is a must watch movie, sad, happens every day to good guys and women. I never expected a return call back from Mr. Klien directly and he helped with advice with Candy Puffcorn. I do like Jelly Belly living in Fairfield, CA. and all, but very hurt by the how the bully part went down.

He does give free wisdom, which helps me give it away to help others who want to be successful without being a bully about it, but making lasting mutual business success.",1423180800,,621,4.535714285714286

4211171,5,B003VSL57A,There are a lot of people who take advantage of nice and giving people. They mistake kindness for weakness. That's what happened to the inventor of Jelly Bellys. So sad to see a non selfish person get duped that way. I like his giving attitude. Like when on his birthday he rents an ice cream truck and hands out free ice cream to kids cause that makes him happy. Makes you wonder what it would have been if he kept his business.

4211173,3,B003VSL57A,"This film probably falls apart in the editing room.

It was a good rise and fall type of story to work with, yet it seemed to be confused as to what it wanted to be when it grew up. It starts out with the feel of His Way, a bio doc on Jerry Weintraub, where a man, child of a baby boomer, makes his claim to fame in the arms of California. It also seemed to be interpolating styles with that of 51 Birch Street, a doc on a son's journey into why his parents formed the family the way they did.

The son should have been limited to either being a sit-down interview subject or just a narrator. Found his scenes distracting. The film probably could have used more music to smoothly tie in cuts between interview subjects.

The story of the Candy Man himself is pretty darn cool, however the execution of that story on this film does a Jelly Belly flop.

4211175,3,B003VSL57A,"This is a fairly interesting documentary about a man with a big dream and a great idea (and a genius marketing plan). Like any other man with big ideas, he made some mistakes. However, there are some confusing aspects about this film that are never truly explained.

1.) David Klein went to law school. While he didn't take the bar exam, one would assume that he knows law. Why did he not have a lawyer with him to sign the contracts?

2.) David Klein knows marketing. One could also assume that, as a direct result, he knows language very well, and the impact it has on individuals, particularly concerning their decision making. If he didn't know this, he wouldn't have manipulated the media to sell his candy. With this in mind, why did he allow himself to be bullied? Why were they able to use the *exact same trick* on him that he played on another person earlier in the film (when he tricked the California copyright owner into accepting only $64,000)?

3.) Speaking of that trick: Herman Goelitz Candy Company, by his own admission, developed the recipes based upon the flavors that Klein recommended. They didn't have the ideas for the flavors (that was Klein) but they came up with the recipes to fulfill his vision. Why did he never offer THEM a partnership? Why wasn't this established as a partnership right from the start? And if it was just a ""we're renting your facilities"" type thing, why didn't Klein have his own workers, his own factory, etc?

Something isn't quite right.

Some of this stuff might have some credibility, but other issues show a weakness in the documentary itself. It was never apparent that Goelitz was this powerhouse candy producer that had multiple executives with the capability of flying in; it seemed like Klein had approached a ragtag mom and pop operation for access to their production lines. This was underscored by the insistence that they had no candy production other than ""some candy corn"" prior to Jelly Belly. Some clarity was needed here to better understand what was going on.

It was also unclear what parts of the operation Klein knew, and what Goelitz knew. So Klein knew the marketing, came up with the idea, the name, the logo -- but he never got his hands on the recipes? Did Goelitz own the copyright on these recipes? Was it ever agreed who would own what?

While Klein was a great idea man, he doesn't seem to have really owned up to his own mistakes, and instead positions himself as someone perpetually conned. At the same time: he sold half his company for a store. And it was HIS idea. There was a year backlog on orders. Klein was not making moves to take his candy to a larger company that could respond to demand. He didn't make moves to purchase his own factory so that he could also be responsible for production. He left the responsibility of meeting the demand to others -- and this deserved some scrutiny.

Still: it would be agony to look at a company that was once struggling and watch it become a $193M empire. It would be far worse (and cruel) to be cut out of the history, when so much of the early brainstorm came from your own head.

What this documentary is, in earnest, is not a pity party for David Klein -- it's a cautionary tale, and this is where the true value lies. By all accounts the business world is even nastier, more manipulative and dastardly than it was in the late 70s. This is a lesson to own all your copyrights (in YOUR name), to lawyer up (with a recommended lawyer) before signing anything, to be generous to the people who help you -- and to always have another idea. I look forward to trying David's new candy!",1347321600,,3617,4.543778801843318
4211176,5,B003VSL57A,"Back in the early '80s when I was ""coming of age"" I first discovered Jelly Belly Jelly Beans.  I was not aware of David Klein nor did he own the company any longer, he had sold by then but what I did know is that I really enjoyed them and loved these colorful and flavorful Jelly Belly Jelly Beans. I also became a fan of President Reagan although I was too young to vote back then.  When President Reagan went up for election for the second term I was 17, rats missed the chance to vote for The Gipper but in spirit I did for what that is worth.  I also became a big fan of Weird Al Yankovic. Out of that era of the 1980s came three important things in my life - Jelly Belly Jelly Beans, President Reagan and Weird Al Yankovic.  Strangely enough three decades later a documentary is produced that brings all three of those important things in my life together and that is Candyman: The David Klein Story. It was like I was 15 all over again.

You don't have to have been a fan of Jelly Belly, President Reagan, or Weird Al to enjoy this documentary. If you are interested in stories behind legends then you'll love this documentary. When I say story behind legends I am talking about the man who invented and created the Jelly Belly.  He is the story behind the legend of the Jelly Belly.  Since watching this I have become a fan of David Klein. So there are four important things related to this story now, Jelly Belly, President Reagan, Weird Al Yankovic, and David Klein. David Klein should go first in the order of importance but I am just showing how Jelly Belly the product (Jelly Belly) he created brought together politics (President Reagan) and candy (Jelly Belly) during a time that Weird Al was flying high in the pop music world all the while David Klein's name was left out of Jelly Belly History but now with this documentary David Klein shall always be known as the real Candyman, the man who invented the Jelly Belly.  I consider David Klein an important historical figure because he invented the candy, the Jelly Belly, that was in the White House while the President was fighting the cold war and demanded the iron curtain fall which it did later on. It was a group effort between President Regan and David Klein in knocking down the Iron Curtain.  David through his Jelly Belly along with President Reagan brought down Communism in Eastern Europe.

The movie is intriguing.  It's the best documentary I have ever seen. When I first watched it I could not take my eyes off of it. Even though I had errands to run and other things to do and meant to watch it later I just could not stop. I watched it all the way through I was so glued to it.  I have watched it a total of 10 times and am going to watch it again and again and again. It's fascinating.  It's a well produced documentary.  You see how Herm Rowland really put David Klein under duress when he sold the Jelly Belly over to Herm Rowland. David Klein should still be at the helm of the Jelly Belly company, not Herm Rowland.  But you know what through watching the documentary I learned that David Klein does not live in the past but is a real trouper and moves on with life. Since he sold Jelly Belly he has come up with so many innovative candy products that are truly impressive. He is a true Candyman, hence the name ""Candyman : The David Klein Story"".  David Klein has been erased from Jelly Belly history but now the truth is out. The truth must be known and this story tells of the truth. It's too bad that I never heard of David Klein until this movie but the good thing is I know about him now and so does anyone who watches this fine documentary.

The great thing about it is too is you see not just the story played out but this documentary features most of the key players in the life of Jelly Belly and of David Klein before Jelly Belly was created and after it was created.  For those who are not able to make the documentary like Cal, well he is deceased but his widow Helene is featured as well as others in the documentary talk about Cal and what he was like and how his and David's relationship was. His wife's mom, I think referred to as Grandma was not interviewed in the documentary but she is featured in stories about her role in the Jelly Belly. You can tell that she played a very important role in the Jelly Belly company. In fact I gather that she played a pivotal role in the day to day operations in running the company. That Grandma really made a difference and David is really close to her too. It's great, features David's wife Rebecca (or is it Rebekah), son Bert, and daughter Roxie. You not only get the story behind the actual Jelly Belly but you also get a feel for David's close relationship with his wife, daughter, son, and his friends. I gather from this documentary that David is a really nice guy who would bend over backwards to help his fellow man (and woman).  That even though he was driven out of Jelly Belly unfairly by Herm Rowland, he pressed on and did not let that affect him as a man. Even though David Klein is really the spirit and inventor of Jelly Belly he does not allow Jelly Belly to define his life.  He is defined as an interesting man who is giving and caring for those around him. He's a top notch guy.  Also we learn his daughter Roxie is a Candywoman, she has invented so many candies herself and runs the new candy company with her father. She is a real gem in the candy industry.  We learn that Bert is a talented animation artist. He does his animation by hand. That's becoming a lost art with today's computer generated graphics. We learn that his wife is his soul mate and inspiration that without each other they would not be who they are today. We learn that David is very loyal to all those who are in his life from the past to the present.

This documentary prompted me to do research into David Klein and I learned that he has a new jelly bean called David's Signature ""Beyond Gourmet"" Jelly Beans. I love them.  They are far beyond what Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are today. Went out and got some.  I am hooked on David's new signature bean.  He does use natural flavors and has created these in exotic flavors. These actually make Jelly Belly look like a cut rate product. I suggest that if you want to taste what Jelly Belly used to be but better then buy David's Signature ""Beyond Gourmet"" Jelly Beans. They are available online and in candy stores too.  You can actually purchase them online here at Amazon. When David had Jelly Belly all those years ago they were much better than they are now. I think under Herm Rowland's direction he has brought the bean down a few notches.  They don't taste as good as they did years ago but David has brought that quality back into his new David's Signature ""Beyond Gourmet"" Jelly Beans. Tasting his is like tasting a vibrant fruit but eating Jelly Belly is like eating sugar with some fake flavoring.  I'd say that David's new bean is tops and once you try them you'll always go back to them. Let's put it this way, Jelly Belly's current offerings taste like a sugar attack with some flavor but David Klein's new bean taste like a flavor explosion with just the right amount of sweet. The perfect balance between flavor and taste. I'm hooked. Gotta order more now.

Bottom line is you need to watch this documentary.  You need to own this on DVD to see not only the documentary but the commentary that David and Bert include in it.  This is a moving documentary that will get you thinking and hook you on watching it.  Take my word you'll love every second of it. God Bless David Klein and his family.",1335830400,2,7600,4.352192362093352
4211187,5,B003VSL57A,"""Candyman"" tells us story behind the invention of the Jelly Belly brand jelly beans and the man that made it all possible, David Klein. The documentary features interviews with David, his family, his former business partners, friends, and even Weird Al, and it quickly draws you in to the fascinating history of what just might be the most popular candy on the market.

One of the most striking things about this documentary is the clearly real look at the Klein family. David wears a white t-shirt through most of it and spends time rolling around on the ground with his dog, his wife sits in a cluttered ceramic work area and fills in some of the back-story, and his son and daughter add insight into what it was like growing up with the ""Candyman"" and the effect on his family when the Jelly Belly product was more or less taken away from him. It is also interesting to see the many different types of candies David tried to introduce throughout the years, some dismal failures with unfortunate gastric side-effects and some that were moderately successful, but none as popular as Jelly Belly.

It is also a documentary that all would be inventors should watch as a cautionary tale of how people you think you can trust might not always have your best interest at heart. I know that Jelly Belly jelly beans will never find their way into my house again after the shameful way David was treated but, fortunately, he has new line of jelly beans&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-s-Signature-Beyond-Gourmet-Jelly-Beans-Flavor-Sampler/dp/B007JBO41E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>&nbsp;to fill the gap.

4211188,5,B003VSL57A,Debbie Schlussel just voted Candyman:the David Klein Story as the best documentary of the year 2011. The documentary tells the story of how the Jelly Belly jelly bean was created with a budget of 800.00.,1325376000,,203,4.828571428571428
4211189,4,B003VSL57A,"Candyman is a documentary about David Klein, the man who invented Jelly Belly jellybeans. At first glance you wonder how Klein could be at all connected to the multi-million dollar company. He seems more the typical ""guy next door"" type than an inventor of a world wide known brand of candy. But soon you realize he's much more.

The story starts out when he is young and just out of high school. The film goes on to explain about his first few jobs and how they lead to his inventing the famous jellybean. There are interviews with his family, friends, investors, etc as well. Footage of Klein promoting Jelly Bellys on television shows across the country is shown and gives us an idea of just how famous and recognizable he was at one time as ""Mr Jelly Belly"". The film not only explains how the company came about, but also how different business decisions (often bad ones) shaped the company into what it is now. By the end of the film, I found myself somewhat angry at how David Klein, the man who founded and put his life into creating the company, had been completely removed from it in any way, by fellow businessmen willing to take advantage of his kind and trusting personal nature. Mr Jelly Belly himself had been erased from anything that had to do with the brand.

While a bit sad, Candyman is a well done film that tells a great story about one of America's most well known candies and the real faces  and stories behind the brands beginnings.",1322352000,4,1457,4.511363636363637

4211192,3,B003VSL57A,"""Candyman"" was directed by Costa Botes about the story of David Klein, the rise and fall of creator of Jelly Belly jelly beans. The film was an Official Selection of the 2010 Slamdance Film Festival, Winner of Director's Choice award at Rincon International Film Festival, and 2010 Official Selection of Hotdocs. The product footage alone will leave your mouth watering and wondering to yourself, ""When was the last time I got to eat the peanut butter and jelly flavors together?"" The most expensive, most flavorful, and best variety of jelly beans on the market had humble beginnings from a salesman of nuts and popcorn.

David Klein is an eccentric -- no doubt about it. We know this because he is scattered in his thought process and loves to keep notes on paper plates because they are good for throwing and he can't possibly lose something as large as a paper plate. He was very intelligent about getting publicity for Jelly Bellys and flavor creation. The uniqueness of the flavors and gourmet beans themselves took off after well-placed stories from the Associated Press were released. Silly television appearances and endorsements by President Ronald Reagan only accelerated their success. When it came time for the business to expand in a major way, the fidgety genius David Klein ended up signing it all away after being bullied by partners without a lawyer.

The story has ups and downs and is an interesting character study of David Klein. Several situations are set-up so that when stories are being told, you can see what David's life was like previously when he was the proud owner of the Jelly Belly brand. Many comparisons are made of David Klein to Willy Wonka...just as whimsical, but with a muttering problem that almost makes him sound like Dustin Hoffman's character in ""Rain Man.""

Weird Al Yankovic is a featured interviewee on this DVD, not because he ever met the man who invented Jelly Bellys, not because he ever even knew that man's name, but more or less as an amusing celebrity who can provide great soundbites about the enjoyment of jelly beans in general and an appreciation for the brand. He has many remarks that are tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic and the documentary plays it almost serious.

If you like documentaries and origin stories, check this out on Netflix, and pick up a bag or box of Jelly Bellys on your way home because you're going to want them close by.

Bonus Features:

There are deleted scenes including more extended quotes from Weird Al about jellybeans including his take on the Harry Potter Bertie Bott's brand of beans and least favorite flavor being vomit (a failed attempt at a pizza flavor for Jelly Bellys) and favorite flavor being pear. David Klein tries to offer to give Weird Al a special flavor jelly bean like Ben & Jerry's does with ice cream. Other scenes that didn't make the cut into the 1 hour 15 minute long film were about the Candyman's tailor including rhinestones on some of his TV appearance costumes, the thought process to creating a flavor like papaya, David doing a strange dance, and losing his cell phone. These are just more highlights to his eccentricities that don't move the story along.

There are TWO full-length commentaries for this documentary -- one by director Costa Botes and the other by Bert Klein (producer of the movie) and David Klein, son and father combination who went through this journey together. The directer remarks a lot on walking the line between memory lane and having a more linear story and grouping interviews by theme to tell the story of David Klein. Despite some locations not allowing them in to film, the director says ""Every time David opens his mouth, something interesting comes out and you can make a movie out of it."" On the Klein commentary, David happily reminisces how he was treated going on TV and flying first class, but insists that all geniuses need to find a good lawyer and is clearly still bitter about feeling bullied into a bad business decision. Besides that, he is thrilled to be talking about a movie made all about him and eager to fill in extra facts and Bert laments a bad haircut he had.",1297296000,2,4132,4.786816269284713
4211193,5,B003VSL57A,"Who invented Jelly Bellys?  Well, I don't know about you, but the first place I'd look for the answer would be on the Jelly Belly website, and more specifically on the company history page.  Go on, check it out and I'll meet you back here in a few minutes.  Alright, according to the official company history it seems that the man responsible for bringing the world Jelly Belly jelly beans would be Herman Goelitz Rowland Sr.  Well actually the history lists Rowland and an unnamed marketing guru, but really Herman seems to have been the man with the plan.  Well that's that, right?  Well, maybe not...

Most of us have heard the fairytale about Jack, his cow, and a bag of enchanted beans, but it wasn't until this past week that I first got a chance to experience a real life variation of the story about a man named David who, instead of selling a cow, sold his bag of magical beans.  Candyman: the David Klein Story is a documentary about the eccentric genius who invented America's first gourmet jelly bean called Jelly Belly.  Directed and edited by Costa Botes (co-director of Forgotten Silver), the film features David Klein and his son Bert (an animator for Disney and the Simpsons) as they take a look back at the Klein's life, the creation of the iconic confection that was championed by none other than former President Ronald Regan, and how Klein more or less erased from the legacy of Jelly Belly.  The documentary follows David on a short tour around a lot of the southern California locations where he worked and developed his passion for making and marketing candy.  The journey is peppered by interviews with friends, family and industry professionals (including some super funny witticisms from Weird Al) reflecting on Klein, Jelly Belly, and his love/obsession with making people happy at any cost.

What really struck me was Klein's son Bert (who also produced the film with his wife) and how he was sort of using this documentary portrait of his father to sort of set the record straight, not so much to stick it to Jelly Belly, but to validate Klein's legacy and passion.  David Klein had the idea to take the ordinary maligned jelly bean (brilliantly described as Easter basket packing material by Weird Al Yankovic in the doc), and transform it into a natural, high-quality, great-tasting candy.  He got the ball rolling, contacting the Goelitz Candy Company and getting them to manufacture his ideal bean, and then took to the road telling everyone that would listen about his creation.  There were local publicity stunts, visits to national TV talk shows where Klein was truly decked out in the part of the proverbial candy-man, and zany photo-shoots, all in the hopes of getting the world to notice these amazing Jelly Belly beans.  It was as if he stepped out of the pages of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  For four years Klein was the face of Jelly Belly and is a huge part of the candy's success.

Costa Botes does a wonderful job of shinning the spotlight on Jelly Belly, Klein and his family, touching on the sadness of the tale without getting too mired in the ennui of corporate shenanigans and unresolved family issues.  The documentary is as much about celebrating Klein's eccentricities and ideas as it is about being written out of the history of a pop culture phenomenon.  From his use of paper plates as notepads (hard to lose and easy to throw), to his later insane confection creations (my favorite being yellow liquid candy sold in urine sample jars), Klein has led a wacky and truly interesting life and it makes for a very entertaining film.  All in all I think this portrait is the perfect way to remind us that there is always more to the story.",1297209600,2,3712,4.715170278637771
4211194,4,B003VSL57A,"Finally, a movie that proves that striking it rich can suck. In the tradition of the where-are-they-now rockumentaries from the Baby Boom era, meet David Klein. And we do meet him - intimately, painfully, honorably, and humorously. Only this former rock star is not a forgotten 70s musician, but a one-shot-wonder in the candy industry, the inventor of Jelly Belly gourmet beans. Not since Ben met Jerry has there been a bigger revolution in the junk food industry. But those two guys apparently had better lawyers. And once you have the inspiration, in the perishable novelty food biz, it's 99% perspiration and not so much fun. David Klein didn't exactly get screwed. He sold his company under pressure for over $4 million and got to keep half it, after taxes, spread out over 20 years. Most of us could live happily ever after on that income. But how much is the human soul worth?  Klein had invested too much of himself in his invention, and could not let go. This is not a Franken-Jelly tale. Klein survived and continued to invent wacky confections (including candy Snot in a plastic nose), but never attained the same sugar high. Worse than losing a billion dollar business, Klein was cut out of the Jelly Belly corporate history, reduced not just to a footnote, but to a cipher. Klein's son Bert (and Bert's wife Jennifer) wanted to set the record straight, and his daddy documentary does just that. Bert was five when the bottom fell out of his father's jelly bean business, and he makes it clear that those were not happy times to be the Son of Candyman. The disconnect between father and son is still visible in the film. A successful animator and filmmaker in his own right, Bert Klein peels the candy coating off their side of the Jelly Belly story. We never get the corporate response, so this remains an incomplete tale. We are left only with the bitter pill - the depression, the legal hassles, and the resentment that remains coiled beneath the surface. The dark, grainy, sometimes badly-lit documentary filming drives home the point. It could be subtitled ""How Not to Succeed in Business While Trying Really Hard."" But David Klein remains the best of all characters - a real live human being struggling to be a nice guy in not so nice world. The documentary may not get his name back into the official corporate history, but it should at least get him into Wikipedia. One can only hope that this great documentary brings some measure of comfort to the Candyman.",1290902400,,2479,4.711981566820277

4211196,5,B003VSL57A,I found myself in Toronto with very little to do on an afternoon in May of this year. I was in town on business and never like to go to see a film by myself but I walked by a theater that had an enormous long line so my natural curiosity got the best of me.  There was a film at this place as part of the Hot Docs program...I must admit that I had never heard of Hot Docs in the United States. I asked a nice man who was waiting in line just what the big deal was. He told me that this was a documentary about the man who created Jelly Belly jelly beans.  I have never been much of a fan of documentaries but I had time to kill so I figured what the heck.  The first bit of good luck was that I managed to get in.  The film was Candyman and it held my interest for the entire time.  I do not want to spoil it for you but all I can say is that the film was fantastic and very inspiring.
