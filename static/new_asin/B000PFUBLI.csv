8191088,4,B000PFUBLI,"MACHO DE MUJER (MALE OF A WOMAN) is a modern version of the film EL DIABLO NO ES TAN MALO (The Devil Is not so Bad) [1949] of Julian Soler.

This movie is about all what a woman suffers in a macho society, in this case, the Dominican Republic, that although it is a very modern country it still has the mentality of the decade of the 50's.

The 3 couples in MACHO DE MUJER belongs to the upper middle class, so their cases are not as bad as the ones a couple very close to the poverty line would have.

It is a comedy of how a woman put on spell on her husband, and the world is upside down.  He is the neglected husband staying at home taking care of the child.  The whole world is now feminist, and as cruel as a macho society.

The film could be a thesis for materialist feminism.  Material feminism highlights capitalism and patriarchy as central in understanding women's oppression.  In other words, it is about economical power.

Per example there is a scene when the husband decides not to tolerate more abuses from his wife and for being economically independent from her, he starts looking for a job.

In Dominican Republic, they do blood tests to people before hiring them.  In those tests they look for drugs, STDs, diabetes, cholesterol and, if you are a woman, pregnancy.

Oh, yes...  That is one of the ""special"" qualities of my country.  They do blood tests to women before hiring them to know, between other things, if she is pregnant.  Another special thing is that a woman cannot have her tubes tied if her husband does not agree with it, ""Because he also has rights.""  As if because he married her, he owns her body.

Anyway, back to the film...

Then it turns out to be that he is pregnant and he is not going to be hired.  Without that money, he cannot take care of his baby and he is forced to live with his wife again and to tolerate her abusive behavior.

A lot of men hate this movie, because they think it is a radical feminist film where they are being mocked all time.

It is not like that.  It is like what the devil told to Julian Soler in the version of 1949, ""There is nothing wrong with the world.  You only have to listen and to be nicer with each other.""

I like this film a lot.  It is really funny, educational and entertaining, because it shows with comedy that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and if society do not help women to be economically independent they will suffer a lot of abuse.",1208563200,3,2451,4.322368421052632
