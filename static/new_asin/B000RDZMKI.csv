It's funny,
then dramatic,
then ends.

That's how most rom/com kdramas are.  If you don't like this format (Which I don't entirely) you shouldn't be looking at kdramas.  And no good looking actor??  Are you kidding me?  You have the butter king playing the doctor!!  What more eye candy do you want?

Having said that, I must add that this drama is funny as heck.  It starts out with such hilarity but unwind as it progresses so not a concrete drama from beginning to end.  It is worth watching though.

I have watched loads of dramas from Asia and I don't like them all.  I do like this drama.  It's funny if you'd just keep an open mind.",1256256000,2,825,4.2727272727272725
8458000,2,B000RDZMKI,"Nothing interesting in this movie... The actors not good looking enough and the story is not happy ending... I don't like that kind of story. Well, you can't say it's not ending, but... this drama has a BAD ENDING ! And that's SUCK ! So forget it !",1182643200,3,248,4.1875
