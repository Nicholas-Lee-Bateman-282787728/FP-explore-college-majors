2453589,4,B000C6NP1I,"In my opinion, it's not as good as ""Kite"" but it is very entertaining and it is definitely not for kids.  The story, involving a bunch of happy-go-lucky mercenaries and violent gangsters starts off with a bang and keeps going until the last scene.  Bullets, bombs, and blood fill the screen in between the car chases and fistfights.  Perfect entertainment!",1039824000,,356,4.9
2453590,3,B000C6NP1I,I first saw the movie in it's uncut form which is the only way to watch it if you saw the uncut then you know what scenes I'm talking about but other wise this is a goods film the blood and guts scene are what make it a 3 star movie and now a 1 or 2 star movie hell the scene when the baseball player gets he's head smashed in by a baseball bat is kool but the uncut is better so if your gonna get this film get it for the blood and guts scenes but if you want to real deal look for the uncut one,1039219200,,496,3.5596330275229358
2453591,4,B000C6NP1I,"People expecting the next Kite should deffinatly not watch this.  Mezzo Forte is much lighter than Kite (although still VERY violent) and takes everything with the tongue placed firmly in the cheek.  Oh and just to make this clear, I saw the cut version of Mezzo Forte (sans all adult scenes).
The dub for this release is also pretty well done.  Some very familiar voices grace the screen, and not the usual Kitty actors (although I read at AnimeonDVD that the girl who Mikaru had a voice double for the more mature scenes).
This is not for kids at all!  There is plenty of nudity and some pretty strong sex related dialogue in the first few scenes.  Also, even though this is a comedy, it is VERY violent.  People are shot, impaled, exploded, and beaten with bats to name a few little things.  A deffinate 16+ viewing experince (and the directors cut is deffinatly a 18+.)",1009756800,4,873,4.5576923076923075
2453592,4,B000C6NP1I,"Well, this 2-ep. OVA was quite a surprise after something like Kite. I really liked Kite for it's no-sweat attitude and violent action sequences. The same things can be found in Mezzo Forte, but it's taken in a slightly different approach.
This anime wasn't made to be taken seriously. It's more of a lighthearted action show rather than a pychological action drama(like Kite was). It's like a Yasuomi Umetsu grab-bag film (meaning that you'll find most of the things he does well in this movie)
The first thing that will strike you about Mezzo Forte is it's art and animation, which are a large step above Kite's (which is excellent on it's own). The character animations are very smooth, and the coloring is very detailed and diverse. Unlike Kite's animation where everything but an action sequence uses mostly still fraims, Mezzo Forte gived nearly equal treatment to every scene throughout. The character designs are very appealing and attractive (espcially for the female characters. You could almost drool over them. I want the director's cut now *gawww*) As you can see, Action scenes aren't the only thing in this show that are a sight to behold.
Speaking of action scenes, this anime takes Kite's standards to a new level. Remember the exploding bullets from Kite? Mezzo Forte has exploding people(well, they're actually sex robots) and explosive bowling balls. Not only are there gun fights, there are also some superbly executed hand-to-hand combat scenes that have great attention to detail in the choreagraphy.
In conclusion, as far as art/animation and action goes, you will not be dissapointed in this title.
Now not 5 instead of 4 stars? Well, that's for the title's lack of depth. You won't turn off the film and start thinking about the plot's twists and turns. The entire film is pretty straightforward. Some people tend to like that in action films, that it not being too cerebral. I'm more of the cerebral type, but this movie was still quite enjoyable. Like I said, Mezzo Forte is quite light-hearted and is filled with jokes and gags. You could almost call it a comedy.
There's a hilarious parody of Die Hard during the second episode and watch for the *blink-and-you'll-miss-it* cameo of Sawa from Kite.
The dubbing is also quite good. I espcially liked Mikura's cute voice done by Ed's voice actor from Cowboy Bebop. The Japanese VAs also do a terrific job.
Overall, the film's lack of depth doesn't keep it from being a very goofy and entertaining story. If you want something like Kite but less depressing, then this is your film.
I also wish Mezzo Forte was longer (only 55 minutes). I thought that it really could have used an extra half hour. I wanted more!
But even though the film is goofy, it is filled with blood and guts. There first scene in the film has a guy beaten to death with a baseball bat and then shot several times. People get shot not once, not twice, but dozens of times before they die. Mezzo Forte isn't for the squemish. As the cover says, this is Kite times 2.",1009670400,21,3012,4.760994263862333
2453593,5,B000C6NP1I,"Slick and stylish, mezzo forte is deserving of awards. top-notch animation and artwork with plenty of dizzying action sequences, ultra violence, and cleverly placed panty shots. Clearly has the potential of becoming an over-the-top series.

2453616,4,B000C6NP1I,"This review of Mezzo Forte is for the unedited ""director's cut"" with all the sex scenes kept in the OVA.  Sorry female anime fans, you probably won't like MF since it's geared solely for male audiences (particularly this version).

Last August, I saw Kite (uncut since I always want uncut versions of everything) and liked its gritty atmosphere along with its grim story and effective use of violence and sex.  Since Mezzo Forte was made by Kite creator Yasuomi Umetsu and has a lot in common with Kite, I had to at least check it out.  I just watched it today and am really pleased with MF.

PLOT

The plot of Mezzo Forte is that there's the Danger Service Agency (DSA), who specialize in dangerous missions for pay.  Mikura Suzuki is a trigger-happy markswoman for the DSA and killing people is as easy for her as cutting soft butter with a table knife.  She's assisted by tech-freak Tomohisa Harada and both take command from their boss and ex-cop Kenichi Kurokawa.  A mysterious old man gives the DSA a mission to kidnap baseball team manager Momokichi Momoi.  The kidnapping job goes awry, and because of this, Mikura and her partners have to deal with Momikichi's extremely dangerous and bratty daughter, Momomi.

ACTION

This is Mezzo Forte's selling point, and Umetsu did a great job in this area.  The action in this is really, really violent.  There's plenty of scenes where Mikura will punch and kick her way through several hefty body guards and even though she's pretty small compared to them, she can make them bleed really hard.  There's plenty of gun battles as well and are well orchestrated (like said martial arts scenes).  There's also things in there that you don't see everyday like exploding bowling balls and exploding cyborgs (mostly sex bots), adding more fun to the already abundant amount of fun found in Mezzo Forte.

CHARACTERS

Honestly, the characters aren't really well developed since we don't really get to sit down and know them.  However, they're pretty well characterized.  For one, Mikura is actually given a memorable personality as a proficient killer yet she has a spunky ""human"" side to her that makes her very likeable.  The best characterization has to be for the villains, Momokichi and Momomi Momoi (what a tonguetwister that was).  You see Momokichi beat one of his failing baseball players to death with a baseball bat (looks like Umetsu was watching too much Casino) in one scene and Momomi will happily kill people that inconvenience her, such as her body guards that failed to keep her dad safe in the bowling alley.  Those to are also well characterized in the sense that they commit really heinous acts to the point where you flat out hate them instead of to the point where you ""love to hate"" them, which is a trap for several anime titles.

MATURE CONTENT

Mezzo Forte is rampant with extreme violence and sexual content that rivals some of the content found in some operations in the Cool Devices series (which doesn't surprise me that much since Umetsu made ""Yellow Star"" for CD before making Kite and Mezzo Forte).  There's two sex scenes where Kurokawa and Harada ""express their love"" to Mikura in bed in a particular fashion, if you can catch my drift.  There's even a scene where Mikura is held captive by Momomi and two thugs that don't particularly like Mikura are invited into the chamber to ""have relations"" with Mikura in a really non-consentual, degrading way.  The violence is equally visceral since bloodshed is rampant and the acts are pretty brutal.  Aside from said scene with Momokichi beating someone with a bat, there's a scene where one of his henchmen pin down Kurokawa and actually pry off one of his fingernails with a screwdriver, which honestly made me cringe.

PLOT PACING

As stated before, Mezzo Forte isn't a particularly deep anime, but there's plenty of plot twists and surprises throughout.  I won't tell you what they are because I don't want to spoil any surprises for you since they're pretty unique.

APPEARANCE

The animation and artwork for a lower budget anime like this is outstanding.  Characters are very well drawn and the female ones are some of the finest eye-candy anime has to offer.  The animation runs very smoothly and the background art is very detailed.  The use of colors is very pleasing to the eyes as well.

FINAL WORD

At the end of the day, Mezzo Forte can be seen as Kite's more upbeat sister.  If you want an action anime with brutal violence and over-the-top sex, Mezzo Forte will be your cup of tea.",1263772800,9,4518,4.764478764478764
2453617,5,B000C6NP1I,"I was very impressed with this movie, after watching the trainwreck that was Kite I was worried about this movie as well knowing it was made by the same creators, but it did not disappoint.

I won't get in to the actual story so I do not spoil it for others, but this movie is about a small group that is contracted to kidnap the owner of a baseball team. The kidnapping goes bad and the baseball team owner is killed in the process. The rest of the movie consists of the owner's daughter and his right-hand man tracking down the team and eventually capturing the main character at which an exchange is made and the movie ends with a nice twist.

In between the main storyline there are numerous fight scenes as well as humerous scenes that help the story flow. The plot is solid and the character development is very good. There are also secondary characters throughout the movie that serve as comedy relief that counters the action sequences and sex scenes that pop up twice throughout the movie.

Overall I really enjoyed this movie and was pleased with the result as I was not expecting such a movie to be both light hearted with it's characters and also have some great action scenes. There is even a nice plot twist thrown in at the end and a really good ending.

The only negative thing I found about this movie was that it eventually had to end.",1258502400,3,1353,4.421686746987952

2453620,3,B000C6NP1I,"This series is not actually ""Banking"" on Mezzo's success, Mezzo Forte was actually created BEFORE Mezzo was ever thought of... Mezzo is a direct sequal and is more of a cash in than Mezzo Forte ever was...

now, onto my review:
Mezzo Forte was originally intended as a Hentai(anime porn). However, the majority of the series was actually filled with action scenes, with only a few hardcore sex scenes sprinkled here and there. A cut version was released afterwads with all of the sex scenes being removed.

This version of the DVD comes with both of the two episodes in their original untouched animated form, as the ""Directors Cut"" on the box would imply. that means it's also got all of the sex scenes.

Animation: **** 4/5
Great animation, although it's a little outdated for nowadays, especially as a 2 episode OAV.

Story: ** 2/5
Nothing special here, standard revenge tale of murder and guns, the main characters bring it up a star, however, as they are al fairly interesting.

Sound: *** 3/5
The voice actors in both the sub and the dub are fairly standard, nothing outstanding, nothing terrible, just average. the sound effects, however, sound great, and you've got all of the atmospheric music you could ever want.

Overall: *** 3/5
If you like action anime, then this is for you. Even though it's short, it packs a punch, and you can always continue it by picking up the much more teen-friendly ""Mezzo"" Series, which is 13 episodes long.",1198800000,33,1447,4.745019920318725

2453634,4,B000C6NP1I,"The reason I said that was because i decided to watch Mezzo forte before the series. Watching the main character kill people in the movie kinda makes it weird when they try not to kill in the series. Well anyway Mezzo forte is not your usual anime that contains non stop action (unless you refer to adult situations action). I actually enjoyed watching the movie even though the adult schenes got out of hand sometimes but its still a likeable anime and the edited version is out there for those of you that can't handle that kind of situations. But over all who doesn't like two girls blasting each other with firearms?

Story: 4(Intresting plot its likeable)

Music: 4(it seemes to blend in with the movie)

2453635,5,B000C6NP1I,"This UNCUT version includes graphic sex, which is why it has garnered lots of buzz in the anime circles. The action and violence is great I love Mezzo Forte.",1140307200,,157,4.448275862068965
2453636,4,B000C6NP1I,"I've been waiting a long time for Amazon.com to pick up the uncut version of this title so I can review it, and here it finally is, with a bonus T-shirt to boot. Fanboy's rejoice.

First off, Mezzo Forte Uncut is a hentai film. Though maybe not as blatant as other animated porn, it still has two very graphic sex scenes in it that may turn people away, especially since they deal with the rape of the main character. If this bothers you (and I wouldn't blame anyone if it did) then redirect your attention to the edited version, which has everything but the sex scenes, and doesn't lose much because of it, at least story wise. And, before you leave now, after this paragraph the sex scenes will not be mentions henceforth.

That out of the way, Mezzo Forte follows Mikura, a tough chick who can and will fight anybody who crosses her path. She's apart of the DSA, a group of private-eye-like agents who only accept dangerous jobs, and they accept their most dangerous job yet in Mezzo Forte. They are charged to kidnap the savage owner of a baseball team named Momokichi. Of course, they accept the mission not knowing exactly what they are getting themselves into; for Momokicki has a daughter who in many ways rivals Mikura, both in skill and in looks, only she's as unstable as an active volcano. What follows is a series of back-and-forth battles between Mikura and Momomi.

The action in this movie is great, and very detailed. The exaggeration of the action, with Mikura doing impossible flips and spins and leaps, makes it all the better. The animation is great as well, better in fact than its non-hentai sequel Mezzo. Though the voices could have been done better, this can be solved by watching the subbed version instead.

Depending on your tastes, I'd recommend this or the cut version to anyone who enjoys solid action in their anime. Also, if you're curious about some of Mikura's past, which is explored a little in the Mezzo series, then pick this up, because some of the cut-scenes seen in Mezzo go all the way back to here. And, because it was made by the same director, Mezzo Forte is almost a direct clone (and they even make jokes about this in the film) to Kite, so pick this up if you liked Kite.",1137628800,10,2221,4.531172069825437
2453637,3,B000C6NP1I,"Well, for one, this dvd does not need to be called Adult/Hentai. The anime does have a few seconds of nudity but nothing sexual. It does however, try to squeeze in panty shots whenever possible. The action is much like Kite but less graphic and is more suitable for a younger audience. When I mean younger, I don't mean 15. If you like Kite the edited version, then you will like this as well, this one with a bit humor added to in. Expect gore and lots of guns, as always.",1128297600,15,473,4.208791208791209

And the girl seems to be a few years older in Intermezzo than she is in Mezzo forte.

Personally Mezzo Forte for me was just as good as Intermezzo was. Whether or not you see the busty babe having sex she still has that same sexy attitude and kicks ass in a big way!",1119571200,10,503,4.185567010309279

2453640,5,B000C6NP1I,"Most anime are fun little distractions, rather then serious works of film.  With that in mind, I have to say I love Mezzo Forte, and I love Mikura.
The main character of the show is the cute, spunky, and feisty Mikura.  She's a badass fighter and really flexible, we never know why she got so good at fighting, but then who cares?  She has a firebrand nature, and can be easily upset.  Where her two partners are spineless to a point, she is afraid of very few things.
In the same Investigation agency she works for, there are two clowns, Harada a young mechanic of cyborgs, and Mr. Kurokawa, a ex-cop with money.
The main story revolves around the trio kidnapping a mob-like owner of a baseball team, but then things go sour fast, and next thing you know there is fighting and explosions, and Mikura!!!  The story is by no means great, as it feels as though the writer wanted alot more then an hours worth, but never got it.  Secondly, this movie is the prelude to the TV series which is either running or will be running on Japanese TV, which means its more of an introduction to the team, rather then a complete ""stand alone"" movie.  In the end the story is enjoyable for what it is.
The animation in the movie is top notch, as it comes from the same guy who brought us the gritty movie ""Kite"".  Mikura, for a cartoon is sexy cute, and all the other characters in the movie are graphically pleasing in their own ways.
In the end this a fun little movie, not to be taken seriously, but to be enjoyed for the zanny characters and the excellent graphics.",1087344000,21,1554,4.352941176470588

Afterwards, they learn that the owner is also an underworld mob boss with a very blood thirsty daughter named Momomi. Momomi seeks the identities of the kidnappers, with intentions on killing them and getting back her father.-summary

Mezzo Forte is another action oriented sleaze romp by none other than Yasuomi Umetsu himself, who also happens to be the director of Kite. Were the two films considered to be sisters, then Mezzo Forte would be the completely mindless one, who is all about the party and getting laid. Personally, I like to think of Mezzo Forte as Kite-Lite. However, it is not the least bit light when it comes down to the hardcore sex scenes. In fact, it actually blows away its sister title in that area, but for many viewers I know, that is not exactly a good thing.

 Umetsu's storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. The story and the plot is incredibly flimsy and fairly predictable. Through the use of several distorted visions, Umetsu attempts to draw a connection between both Mikura and Momomi. As obvious and predictable this supposed twist may have been, it still supplied the anime with a bit of a foundation and provided a small amount of suspense. Unfortunately, instead of elaborating on this further, Umetsu took the low road and delivered hardcore sex scenes along with more action scenes, and as a result, the only interesting part of this story ended up as mere window-dressing. The story element took a back seat and wasn't even slightly developed. It was a total waste and served absolutely no purpose to the plot or the ending.

 The characters are equally bland. Mikura's partners use the buddy cop gimmick, but I felt no real chemistry between them. Momomi is the only interesting character due to her mean streak. She kills for very small reasons, and she could have been the show stealer if given more screen time. The character was badly under used, and she came off as just another stock bad guy.

 Mezzo Forte is pretty much blanketed with action. The action scenes consist of many hand to hand fights and very bloody gun battles. The violence is very high with characters taking bullets in places you don't normally see, along with at least one very short torture scene. The animation is one of the strongest points, with decent character movements during the battles. I won't say that they have good choreography, but they get the job done. The sex scenes have a lot of detail. This is indeed a triple x feature, with scenes that can rival many of the hardcore titles out there. The viewer is in the front row seat for everything and nothing is left up to the imagination. There's only two scenes and they're among the most graphic I seen in anime. You get it all right here; threesomes, DP's, internal shots, just about everything. There's also quite a bit of fan service with no sex at all, and even one that features a shower scene with Momomi.

 The artwork isn't on the same level as Kite at all. The character designs and backgrounds have a cartoony look. There was music present during the action scenes and such, but there was nothing that caught my ear. This also goes for the sound effects as well. The dialogue contains quite a bit of foul language and some dirty sex talk. The voice acting is pretty good for the dub, but it took awhile for Mikura to grow on me.

 Many fans of this anime will have you believe that it's a mature title. Quite the opposite, there is nothing mature about it. The action scenes are incredibly far-fetched, with everyone possessing superhuman strength for unknown reasons. The sexual content is the stuff only teen boys will find cool so they can get together and giggle about.

 Mezzo Forte is one of those titles I came into on my quest to see every anime title ever made. It's one of those titles that I also wish I can unsee. It's also a big part of the reason along with Legend of the Overfiend and La Blue Girl why I hate this anime sub-genre to begin with. After this title, I stayed as far away from the genre as humanly possible. So I guess then I'll never see every anime title ever made.

 Mezzo Forte is one of the best anime titles out there, if you want to turn someone new away from the genre. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone other than hentai fans. If you saw Kite and hated it despite the slight character development and story. Then you will despise this since it contains none of that.
