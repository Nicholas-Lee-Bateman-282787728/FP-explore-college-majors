6198905,5,B00HR3D56O,The kids and adults love this movie. It's a good movie. I did not have to worry about what was the kids gonna see,1395619200,,113,3.75
6198906,3,B00HR3D56O,Review is only about the quality of the video in the three pack and not about the movies themselves. The video is a bit grainy and not very clear.,1394755200,,146,4.068965517241379
6198907,3,B00HR3D56O,"I have never watched any of these movies before, but decided to purchase them for my child. I assume that if you want reviews on the actual movie there are plenty to be found. So instead I am reviewing the packaging of the DVD's. There are 3 DVD's that come in the same case. They are stacked one on top of another. I prefer my discs to be separated by something. If you want to watch one of these movies you will have to pull of other discs to get to it.",1394064000,3,455,3.9565217391304346
6198908,5,B00HR3D56O,Purchased 2 of these DVDs and Amazon was kind enough to adjust the price per DVD without my even asking. Haven't seen 'Happy Feet' yet but I can highly recommend 'March of the Penguins' as one of the finest nature films ever made. My grandkids are gonna love it.,1393545600,,262,4.36734693877551
6198909,5,B00HR3D56O,"Not new films. But if you did not buy these 3 great penguin movies at the time they were first available, this is a golden opportunity (should have said black/white op in honor of the penguin coat, right?).
Both Happy Feet DVDs are animation and provide not only penguin dancing delight to thrill young kids, but there are jokes and music mixed into the film that obviously are directed for older adults. It's a full-family entertainment that is fun to watch many times. My 2-year-old grandson is captivated, as is my retired wife and me, also retired. But not too tired to again visit penguins antics.

The March of the Penguins we first watched in the theater, an absolute delight on the big screen. But we also enjoy it on the TV screen. Don't waste your time with a computer screen for this one. It needs to be seen in all it's vista splendor. You will fall in love with the real penguins in this film, just like the animated cartoon variety in Happy Feet.
You can't beat the price. At this review time it was less than $11 for 3 feature length films. Each one worth the price asked.

Highly recommended family entertainment.
Awesome gift idea for a penguin lover of any age.",1392940800,11,1179,4.5046728971962615

6198959,1,B00HR3D56O,This is the first review Ive ever written after years of being a prime member. Highly disappointed in this product (has nothing to do with the actual movie which is great) and wish I wouldve gotten it from a real store. All three DVDs come stacked on top of each other in one case. It didn't say it was wide screen...it is. The quality is horrible. Definitely not in HD. Im very unhappy with this purchase.,1510444800,,406,4.355263157894737

6198981,5,B00HR3D56O,"I love animated movies but always made the excuse that I buy them for the grandkids.  I borrowed the original Happy Feet and loved it so much I bought this triple feature for myself and don't mind admitting it.

March Of The Penguins is a documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman and is a wonderful look into the life of Penguins.  I couldn't help but compare the animated Penguins to those shown in the documentary and am amazed at the incredible talent of those who created Happy Feet 1 and 2.  The animators had to have spent many hours studying the movements of the live penguins because the animated counterparts are incredibly lifelike.

My Grandkids love Happy Feet, and as I said up front so do I.  But there is more to this story, one that proves my belief that no one can be anything but happy while watching Happy Feet.  I have 72 hour shifts as a caregiver for Gladys, a 94 year old lady with Dementia.  She has frequent episodes of manic and/or combative behavior and nothing but time or medication could bring her back.  We have to be extremely cautious about what she sees on TV because there are triggers that can cause her to get lost in a delusion, believing what she is watching is real. I brought Happy Feet thinking it would be safe, and her reaction when I played it the first time was priceless. Watching her watch the movie was incredibly satisfying.

She was rapt, wouldn't take her eyes away from the movie for anything.  I watched her watch Happy Feet and was amazed and so darn happy with the effect it had on her.  Hearing her wonder aloud ""how did the penguins learn to talk"" brought a smile to my face that lasted for days, still can whenever I remember the look of amazement on her face.  Happy Feet is our medicine of choice when she starts getting lost, the ""beautiful blue eyes"" bring her to a happy place instead of the nightmare she would have ended up in if we didn't have these DVD's.  She will watch these as many times as she can, never having a bad episode with one exception. She watched the movies twice, requested a third but during the third got mad because the ""Pelicans took over the TV all day""!

Get this set, it doesn't matter if it is for your kids, grandkids, or for yourself. If you know someone with a Dementia diagnosis recommend or give the gift of this DVD for their caregiver. This is one movie I can confidently say you will not regret having in your DVD library.  You may not have happy feet by the end of the movie but you will come away happy.

My sincere gratitude to the creators for the wonderful and amazing emotional impact you have given Gladys, and those who care for her.",1466467200,9,2640,4.399176954732511
