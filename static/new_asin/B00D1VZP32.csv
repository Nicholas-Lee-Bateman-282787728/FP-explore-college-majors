8725088,5,B00D1VZP32,"I am an intermediate exerciser, work out quite regularly and found myself quite challenged with this workout. I used 5 pounds weights and after doing the whole workout (the bonuses add up to one full hour), I had fun, sweated buckets and felt great. The workout consists of the warm up, several blocks alternating 2 minutes of strength with 2 minutes of cardio and cool down. What I most liked about it was the variety it proposes by showing so many options and levels, the structure of the workout, I found it varied, and maybe most of all the instructor's attitude. She is really encouraging and motivating without being a drill sargent. She made me try and give my best but not feel beaten up if I missed one rep. Thank you Aimee and keep them coming!",1376352000,3,754,4.510948905109489
