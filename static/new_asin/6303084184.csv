7836971,4,6303084184,"This video is part of a 4-tape series that covers all aspects of Formula One or grand prix racing as a sport. I strongly encourage anyone who is seriously interested in grand prix racing to get this. The series was made in 1992 by Fench television, and the english commentary is narrated by renowned motor racing journalist Bob Costandouras - you'll recognize his voice if you watch F1, he is the guy who asks the questions in the post-race press conferences. The grand prix tape is very interesting, since it goes all the way back to when it all started in France around 1906 or so when actually the first races were held. The footage is wonderful, I was amazed that there were film documents from that long ago! After the history bit the documentary follows a standard grand prix weekend with practice, qualifying and the actual race, and the viewer gets a lot of insights into this very complex and technical sport. Again the chosen video footage is of great quality and it is very interesting to see how the sport has changed over the years. There are a lot of interviews with key people, some of them in French that are sub-titled. Overall a very nicely put-together documentary, less one star in my rating, since it is outdated by 9 years at this point.",994636800,9,1259,4.575221238938053
