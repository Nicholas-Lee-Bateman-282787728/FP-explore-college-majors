7697544,5,B01D5KI3XW,"In Blu-Ray  format, this Yanni concert is OUTSTANDING. The music (of course), the use of color, filming, and fireworks at the conclusion. Best of all, the great Egyptian pyramids in the back drop, the full moon, and Yanni's great words of wisdom.  And can he play the piano and synthesizer!

I lovvvvve it.  I watched it over and over again the day I got it delivered to my house till the next few days.  Yanni's Music has a Master Mind in it.  He seems to love exploring the differences of sounds in each and every instrument, and then he put them all together making each and everyone of the sound fit in perfectly as an orchestra.  His music seems to be differentiated from other musicians I've listened to before.  His music has a personality of highly value the uniqueness and differences of sounds which each individual members of his orchestra put out (emotionally and professionally) via the instruments.",1481932800,,672,4.6440677966101696
7697553,5,B01D5KI3XW,"If you are a Yanni fan you must order this concert. The scene, the music, it is so delightful. I had the privilege to see Yanni this year in Washington, D.C., and he is just as great as you see on recorded concerts. Already own Acropolis, Tribute, Live: The Concert Event, Live At El Morro, Voices and now this masterpiece. Thank you, Yanni for your music, for your message to humanity and the love we should always express to nature and the people around us. Love you :-)",1481068800,,472,4.375

I consider myself a good Yanni follower from when he started. I think is time for him to work on new material so that we can continue idolizing him.",1475452800,,245,4.23404255319149

7697569,2,B01D5KI3XW,"I have been looking forward to the much awaited Yanni's Dream concert Blu-ray since October. But when i was finally able to get it shipped, it's disappointing to say that my ""Dream"" was crushed.
As a huge Yanni fan from Sri Lanka. I own all of Yanni's concert DVD's and Blu-Rays all ranging from Live in Acropolis, Yanni Tribute, Yanni Live, Yanni Voices, Live in El Morro, World without Borders and even the latest ""Dream Concert"".
I even was able to watch Yanni's concert live abroad as well as in Sri Lanka.

Much as we love Yanni, we also love his musicians. Not only Yanni's performance, we also look forward to see how the musicians perform with great feeling. But this time when we watched the Dream concert, all our expectations were shattered. Even though it was claimed to be filmed in 4K digital , the quality of the concert was much lower than of a video shot by a mobile phone. The picture quality and the sharpness seemed very poor. And the color depth and the skin colors were a disaster. And even the sound quality was not what was expected. The Blu-ray of The Live Concert in El Morro is perfection compared to this.

Not to mention, what's the intention of editing a 2 hour concert to a mere 1 hour ? I feel that compared to the previous Yanni concerts, the video direction and editing in this concert was very poor. The angles the musicians are being shown in this was just disappointing. Watching this made us very bored and there were even moments where we got sleepy. What's sad is that, none of the previous concert DVD's and Blu-rays of Yanni's concerts weren't this disappointing.
We, watch all the musicians play with great interest. We are such fans that we have even memorized all the parts of who plays what. So, after watching the ""Dream Concert"", I am sorry to say that it was a massive failure.

We as huge Yanni fans, were expecting a real Dream Concert. Unfortunately, this time our dream was crushed severely.
A very disappointing production indeed.

7697572,2,B01D5KI3XW,As a long time Yanni fan I was looking forward to this.  Disappointed that it is only an 1 hour long and its sounds super electronic and not very organic.

7697593,1,B01D5KI3XW,Just a one hour concert where enthusiasm of the orchestra is missing. The yanni charm and magic is not there. The orchestra members looked washed out and there is too much avoidable dialog from Yanni. The fireworks just added as a distraction. Though the setting with Pyramids as a backdrop and the enthusiastic crowd was there it does not in any way lift the drab performance. THIS BLURAY SHOULD BE AVOIDED unless you want to complete your collection of Yanni's performances.,1467158400,10,476,4.888888888888889

I think other reviewers who gave it a negative view have other personal expectations in demand but having this bluray to begin with and to have a coverage of the dream concert is blessing enough. What if this bluray/dvd never existed?...you'll be begging for one for sure.  I'm happy that Yanni made one period and I enjoy what is presented in this concert.",1466553600,,463,4.511904761904762

The other thing some reviews indicate is the mix of the crowd into the music, sometimes for no apparent reason.
