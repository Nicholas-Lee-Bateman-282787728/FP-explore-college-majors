8458167,5,B0055EHW1Q,"I've seen first-hand the miracles shown in this film and known personally several of the people who were healed of everything from paralysis to cancer. The Pittsburgh Press even admitted people were being healed as portrayed in ""Quest for Truth,"" but they couldn't explain how.  The combination of spiritual power with innovative use of music make this the most compelling portrayal of hands-on healing I've seen.",1384473600,,413,5.257575757575758
8458168,5,B0055EHW1Q,"This was old-school style filming, but I love hearing about the healing power of Christ and His love for us. He wants us whole through his power alone it happens.",1370304000,,162,4.433333333333334
8458169,1,B0055EHW1Q,The title is BS!!! No expose its a promotional video for this false prophet...Save your time and money and stay away from this video its a crappy format as well.,1366934400,3,161,4.4
8458170,1,B0055EHW1Q,This is not an expose.  This is an advertisement.  Don't bother... you've been warned.  The first reviews are obviously fakes....just like his healing and the title they call an expose.  This is also 23 years old!  I'm so mad!,1355616000,5,226,4.6923076923076925
8458171,5,B0055EHW1Q,This amazing video documents real life situations in which Rev. Richard Rossi heals the sick and the possessed. Viewing these miracles on this DVD gives an authentic picture of faith healing at its best. I believe Rev. Rossi is a true conduit of divine healing energy. His gifts are God given and and come from divine love. I was inspired by this documentary and recommend it to others who wish to be healed or to become healers themselves.,1312588800,3,440,4.653846153846154
8458172,5,B0055EHW1Q,"I have been a Christian for many years and so far have never before seen a video which can be said to portray the effect of a spirit led healing service anywhere as well as this one does. In this video we see real people and what happens to them as they have their first opportunity to meet a loving and forgiving God. The music is real, the action is real, and the results are real.",1310515200,2,383,4.052631578947368
