8119077,5,B000F8O4CW,"It's peppered with fights, gunplay, murders, and other things to get the blood pumping, but this is not some rampage-style action movie: most of the excitement comes in the form of fighting words. I would recommend because it has an upbeat counterpoint that starts at the theme and vivifies the whole movie, so that even when the second half gets a little slow, you're never having a bad time.

It's a story about crime, friendships, partnerships, it's got some good action, some big crimes-gone-awry, and the film makes you think a bit too.

Other small points: films a little long so be ready for that. No real romance subplots.",1508112000,,630,4.770642201834862

8119079,4,B000F8O4CW,"Considering he shot 23 yakuza-action movies between the years 1972 and 1978, it's a wonder director Kinji Fukasaku could keep the characters, stunts and scripts from spilling over into each new production.  In actuality, there's a good bit of recycling going on in Cops versus Thugs, with familiar actors from the Battles Without Honor and Humanity films (recently released as a box set by Arrow Video) shuffled into new roles and familiar scenarios given a fresh twist.  Here, it's an unlikely friendship between Detective Kuno (Bunta Sugawara) and up-and-coming yakuza Kenji Hirotani (Hiroki Masukata) that sets the stage for an almost Shakespearean family tragedy.

The title, Cops versus Thugs is more than a bit of a misnomer as the script (by BWH&H screenwriter Kazuo Kasahara) is primarily focused on the blurred lines on both sides of the law.  Det. Kuno and the cops at his local precinct aren't exactly on the take, but their method for keeping the peace involves making sure one gang has an edge over the other.  In this case, the Ohara gang (led by Hirotani) is given a leg up on every bit of information in town, keeping the rival Kawade gang in a distant second place, despite some corrupt government officials trying to selfishly turn the tide.

And it's a land deal gone bad that instigates a full-on war.  With violence spilling over in the streets, city officials call for an outside task force to take charge led by Lt. Kaida (Tatsuo Umemiya), whose by-the-book strategy doesn't gel with the local laissez-faire policy.  The surprise raids put a strain on Kuno and Hirotani's tenuous friendship, culminating in a standoff in which only one of them will be left standing.

It takes nearly an hour for Cops versus Thugs to find the core of its story.  Fukasaku's chaotic action scenes combined with an overabundance of cops, bosses and underlings makes it difficult to sort out exactly who is at the center of Kasahara's script, which a title card claims is based on actual events.  But when the film finally settles on Kuno and Hirotani's yin-yang relationship, the drama begins to pay dividends.

While Cops versus Thugs offers up its share of typical action tropes - beatings, rumbles, rape and revenge, all shot with a rough 'n ready documentary style - its the ethical argument behind Kuno's style of law enforcement that puts meat on the script's bones.  Sure, he drinks on the yakuza's tab, screws the yakuza's women and greases palms in their favor, but the result is a peaceful equilibrium in which everyone comes out ahead.  Lt. Kaida's hardcore approach, strictly following the letter of the law, results in more arrests and more dead bodies.  But just when you think the film will choose a side, another facet is revealed, leaving the audience with an ethical quandary all their own.

Arrow Video's hi-def transfer is another solid Toei import and includes a few extras that will certainly enhance your appreciation of the film, including a 10-minute ""introduction"" by Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane and an another video essay by film scholar Tom Mes.  Both pieces cover the director's major cinematic achievements are the current films' place in his oeuvre.  There's also a bit of archival behind-the-scenes footage and the original theatrical trailer.  A DVD version of the feature is included as well as an insert booklet with new writing on the film.",1496188800,2,3385,4.948763250883392
8119080,4,B000F8O4CW,"Cops Vs. Thugs is regarded by many to be director Kinji Fukasakus greatest single-film achievement in the yakuza genre. Cops Vs. Thugs was made at the height of popularity of Toei Studios jitsuroku boom: realistic, modern crime movies based on true stories taken from contemporary headlines.

Returning to the screen after completing their Battles Without Honor and Humanity series together, Fukasaku joined forces once again with screenwriter Kazoo Kasahara, composer Toshiaki Tsushima and star Bunta Sugawara to create one of the foremost achievements oh his career as well as a hard-boiled classic which is still ranked as one of the best Japanese films of the 1970s.

Its 1963 in the southern Japanese city of Kurashima, and tough-as-nails detective Kuno (Sugawara) oversees a detente between the warring Kawade and Ohara gangs. The Kawades use political connections to further their activities, and the Oharas have an alliance with the local police. Best friends with Ohara lieutenant Hirotani (Hiroki Matsukata), Kuno understands that there are no clear lines in the underworld, and that everything isn't painted in blacks or whites, but varying shades of grey. When a gang war breaks out, Kunos superiors begin cracking down on the yakuza and command the cops to stop fraternizing with the criminals.

In the world of Fukasaku, there is no honor among thieves or lawmen. The only thing that matters is personal honor and duty among friends.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD edition include a new video appreciation of Fukasaku, theatrical trailer, reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork, and illustrated collectors booklet containing new writing on the film. The film is in Japanese, with English subtitles.",1495670400,2,1754,5.367272727272727

Film = barely three (3) stars.  Director Kinji Fukasaku and his confederates have created  a modern, mythical ""Japanese Wild West.""  The film (with most exteriors shot along the South Western coast of Honshu) strings action scenes together like pearls on a strand.  Unfortunately, most of these are paste and repetitious nonsense.  This overly-long, action movie essentially goes pretty much nowhere (plot development is rather minimal) beyond purporting to be a slice of (multidimensional, criminal) life.  Most character types wear nibu boushi (two hats) with one always being yakusa (thugs also wear two, since they may belong to multiple gangs and/or be of different generations): local cops; area Prefecture (State) cops; police detectives; councilmen; the mayor et al.; ""good"" yakusa; ""bad"" yakusa; hostesses; lawyers; etc.  Cops and thugs share the same offices, restaurant gatherings, and prostitutes as well as drive the same (mostly police) cars.  Intramural and in-group fighting is an ongoing process, of course, so there are many (often similar) scenes of shouting, fisticuffs, car rammings, and shootings (plus a few that are nude to break up the monotony).  The Director also throws a land swindle or two into the mix (and tosses around some big-league corporate names that would seem to be grounds for libel suites!).  Actors appear to strain to provide varied performances, but the repetitious nature of the script and direction yields a fair amount of ham.  Line readings, though, are often delivered with great Kansai-ben accents (performers can really ""roll those R's""!).  Cinematography (wide screen, color) is okay, but a bit hazy (over filtered?) which reduces image sharpness (however, this may be the result of using ""good enough"" original source material for disc release) .  Subtitles are sometimes too long for such short flash rates.  Translations also need to use different colors when the dialogue overlaps between characters.  Music is good.  Interior set decoration is rather space.  A light-weight time killer.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1452902400,,2260,5.431034482758621
8119082,5,B000F8O4CW,"In at least 6 movies by director Kinji Fukasaku, Bunta Sugawara played a yakuza thug.  This time, he carries a badge but his character hasn't lost his distaste for double-dealing bosses and authority figures who are out to cover their own butts.

Detective Kuno is balanced between the law and pragmatism.  Cops didn't enforce the law to the point of pushing gangsters over the edge.  In return, the gangsters mostly stayed out of the public eye.  Some of them even became friends with cops, sharing a mutual desire to keep-down trade unions and leftists.  When that balance is upset, Kuno has to decide where his loyalties lie.  In this gray world, cops aren't always good and gangsters are thoroughly bad.. although there's no reward for good men who drink from the cup of corruption.

""Cops Versus Thugs"" has that trademark Fukasaku camera-work.. constantly moving, zooming, and putting you right in the middle of the action, changing loyalties and political maneuvering between cops and criminals.

Oh yeah, it was shot and takes place in the 1970's.. so dig that righteous polyester!",1208995200,10,1088,5.0
