5685604,4,B00C1LIZI0,Not your ordinary cookie cutter film.  Has many layers and relies on the viewers to read a lot in between the lines (or images) for the full impact.  Beautifully photographed in sharp high contrast black and white except when color is used for symbolic contrast.  A great deal is conveyed in short (many times wordless) scenes.  For those that emotionally tune in - you will want to watch it several times.  Yes it contains beautifully shot male sex and lots of gorgeous male hunks used as set decoration but there is so much else in the stew that these choice morsels easily get lost in a connoisseurs entre.,1370044800,15,609,4.601851851851852

5685606,4,B00C1LIZI0,There is little to fault  with this film. It is  beautifully  photographed mostly in black and white and the acting and directing are exceptionally  good. It won't be to everyone's taste as it is indeed slowly paced. It offers a different perspective of James Dean compared with what we have  seen before in other  films on Dean. Stay with it and you will be rewarded. A must see. Only one extra-a short film about the childhood of Derek Jarman.,1369008000,26,445,4.569620253164557

I don't think I have ever seen a film that is so quirky yet has this strange ability to hold your attention and leave you wanting more. The lighting, the way it is filmed, and the way the story is told are not like anything I have ever seen in a film. The acting is good as well. I would recommend this film to indy-film, art house film, and alternative film fans. If you are looking for a mindless summer blockbuster big action film you might not be interested.

5685609,5,B00C1LIZI0,"One of my favorites of 2012.  The film is daring, unusual, and yes, very sexy.  Takes no prisoners.  Definitely not for everybody and likely to be divisive, but I liked it as much on Amazon-stream as when I saw it in Toronto over a year ago.  If you're willing to let go of certain preconceived notions of what a movie should be and simply give in to the experience, you are in for a pleasant surprise.  The film builds beautiful moods and tones, using image and music and gentle rhythms of editing.  The performances are very moving, especially amongst the supporting cast, and the movie's final verdict on James Dean is surprising and though-provoking.  This is a hard film to describe but an easy film to recommend.  I put it on my best of 2012 list because the director and writer completely re-conceive what a biographical film can be.",1368403200,15,840,4.590604026845638

5685643,4,B00C1LIZI0,"Review - Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean

Set in 1951 just before James Dean exploded into super stardom, mixing fact and fiction tells the story of the legend from the point of view of his roommate whom he had a torrid affair with, (The roommate William Bast became a successful writer, but never got over his obsession with Dean and wrote two books about him). Exquisitely photographed in black and white in a style that will make David Lynch proud, this is a haunting film that will show you how the closeted network of gay actors of Hollywood in the 50s used to live. The only draw back I saw is the lead, he looks like the icons (at times) but other time he looks like a Santa Monica street hustler from a bygone era, the likes I have seen many times before. Otherwise we get an array of beauties plucked from the West Hollywood Clubs and sets that are spectacular. Although this film has an estimetd budget of 1 Million Smackeroos I don't see it suitable for straight audiences its a gay film.",1417564800,2,1011,4.406417112299465
5685644,3,B00C1LIZI0,"I'm on the fence about this one. Visually it is a beautiful film. I would have liked to have seen some 16mm in color for some sequences. Cinematography was great.  I really liked the lighting and use of sets. The story to me seemed what a collaboration between Oliver Stone and Brett Easton Ellis would have been like. It's full of bisexual escapades of our main character. The movie focuses on James Deans time before he moved to New York. It's a good film don't get me wrong, but when I watch a biopic I like the stories to be based on facts and not fantasy. If you are making a film about someone's like base it on facts. If not it's just a story. But this is a good story. Borderline Cinemax at times, just a heads up. I have to admit I was ready for it to be over before it ended.",1415318400,,785,4.097402597402597
5685645,2,B00C1LIZI0,Bought it for a friend who lives out near Joshua Tree where it was filmed.  I watched it first and didn't care for it.  He wasn't impressed with it either.  Not so much James Dean as the filmmaker gazing lovingly into a mirror at his own homoerotic fantasies.,1405123200,,259,4.354166666666667
5685646,5,B00C1LIZI0,"The movie is filmed in a style that works great for the 50s.  Dan Glenn, as a supporting actor adds a stable force through out the film, that helps keep the story grounded.",1399507200,,172,4.212121212121212
5685647,5,B00C1LIZI0,"This is Art on film: Stark, stunning, beautiful and haunting.  I was never big on the iconic persona of James Dean nor much interested in his flip-flop desires.  At least this unique film brought the mystique of Dean into its much needed true light apply starring the gorgeous and well-performed James Preston.  This is also a must see for any student of film production and technique and direction.  A special biographical film and one to add to my library collection.",1396483200,4,469,4.825

5685661,2,B00C1LIZI0,"This is not the true James Dean.  The real talent of James Dean is not mentioned in the movie except at the end.  He was a very talented man and would have had many more movies to his credit. View this movie, but please keep in mind his real natural talent: acting!",1389225600,,265,4.076923076923077
5685662,5,B00C1LIZI0,Well the acting for starters. .James Preston is not just another pretty face. His performance as well as dan glenn dalilah ..fantastic.  The cinematography the dream like states all very mesmerizing. .cant stop watching.,1388275200,3,220,5.470588235294118
5685663,5,B00C1LIZI0,"I saw it at Frameline. The director said the Joshua Tree section was fiction, but the rest was based on research on his life. Very visual, poetic, thoughtful, sexy movie. One of those films you went to re watch from time to time.",1387324800,6,229,4.348837209302325

5685665,5,B00C1LIZI0,I don't know if this is the real James Dean or how close to him it comes. But it is an intriguing picture that makes him far more interesting than his movie performances. He's wonderfully human and his seeming vulnerability and sensitivity are very well expressed. Well worth watching.,1385769600,3,285,4.836734693877551
5685666,4,B00C1LIZI0,Enlightening movie on Mr. Dean. I wasn't aware that his active history was so short lived. I like black and white films. I thought James Dean was an over-rated actor in his films.,1384560000,2,179,4.454545454545454
5685667,4,B00C1LIZI0,"For a first attempt, it is amazing that the B&W photography approaches the genius of Sven Nykvist (Bergman's cinematographer). Extremely impressive. After seeing this about 10 times, several flaws became apparent. Firstly, Dalilah Rain is as miscast here as Mia Farrow was in Gatsby. She is, frankly, ugly and uninvolved, mumbling her lines with indifference. Hardly an S&M dominatrix. The woman who reads the ""poem"" in French had a laughable accent, and apparently didn't understand the words. Definitely not a native speaker. With a film as artsy as this, the nude guys floating on inflated rafts at Rogers could have been a quantum leap more beautiful.

  But four actors make this film sublime: James Preston (Dean), Edward Singletary (Roger), Dan Glenn (Roommate), and the cutest of all, Nick Heyman (Boy from Malibu). Preston looks nothing like Dean, is much cuter and not as sexy. Dean was always squinting and always looked in pain. Yet Preston has captured the rebel's inner torment and resilience. If anyone knows him, tell him I have written a script for him. Preston is a star with imminent ascendancy.

  Another wonderful dimension in the film is the fantastic 40s music. This is a film in my top 20, but I hope Mishory et al. will be more attentive to detail, to the Gesamtkunstwerk, in their next films. Kudos to all.",1381968000,2,1333,4.928571428571429
5685668,5,B00C1LIZI0,"This film is very well done. It is quite an insight to James Dean.
It is well acted by all, sort of a film ""Noir""
The music is exceptional, wish there was a soundtrack available.",1381881600,6,178,4.114285714285714
5685669,5,B00C1LIZI0,The film was very well made and introduced me to aspects of James Dean's life of which I was completely unaware (in particular his bisexuality).,1380844800,4,144,4.8
5685680,5,B00C1LIZI0,"Bold and Dreamlike, stunning black and white Cinematography, beautiful score. Not perfect, yes the acting could have been better, but overall an exceptional film. At times has a David Lynch feel. James Dean gone but not forgotten.",1380326400,4,230,5.243243243243243
5685681,4,B00C1LIZI0,"Joshua Tree, 1951 is beautifully photographed, set and costumed but remains more a curated effort than a living story about James Dean's early days. The script tries hard to be poetic but often comes off as stilted instead. And some of the acting feels memorized rather than felt and thought.

That being said, there is still a lot going for it. The scenes in the desert are almost alarmingly beautiful, nearly overshadowing the little drama taking place between the characters. Some of the acting is quite good. I especially enjoyed watching Dalilah Rain, who brings a real sense of lived life to her role as an actress who never found her fame in Hollywood. Also good is James Preston who plays James Dean. By that I don't mean that he's a good actor, but like so many stars from the old days of Hollywood, he's someone you like to look at, is intriguing and charismatic and hints at depths he withholds just enough to make you want more of him. So, he's not James Dean, but then, who is?

Even with it's faults, this is a haunting film that creates and maintains - for the most part - a mood of darkness and sorrow, too cool to be noir, but blessedly free of irony or condescension. This is a gay indie film with a small budget and not a lot of time to rehearse or shoot. Still it manages to achieve something - a feeling, a mood, a sense of life slipping away - that makes this a film I'd recommend to others.",1379635200,2,1413,4.3688212927756656
5685682,1,B00C1LIZI0,"If you've never seen East of Eden or Rebel Without a Cause or Giant; and if you know and care nothing about James Dean; and if you'd rather look at Abercrombie & Fitch ads than watch a movie; and if you like to daydream that all beautiful men are gay; and if you like gazing at James Preston; and if a line like ""It was as if I had seen in black and white my entire life and suddenly I saw in color"" (in an excruciatingly solemn movie that switches between black and white and color) sends you into ecstasies of intellectual bliss, then this is the movie for you.

If you HAVE seen the real James Dean in ANY movie, then you cannot for one second accept this milky crap as anything but one very stupid man's wet dream. Matthew Mishory should be slapped silly for wasting fantastic cinematography on this silly, stupid, pretentious movie.

I admit that James Preston is fabulously beautiful, and if this movie hadn't even pretended to be about James Dean, then I could have gazed in drooling stupor at him in every frame. But his transcendent gorgeousness is one reason he makes an absolutely terrible James Dean. Dean looked and acted more like James Franco than like James Preston.

The other reason Preston makes an absolutely terrible James Dean is that he's a smug, self-satisfied, talentless wimp, gorgeous on the outside with nothing but marshmallows inside. Dean was raw, vulnerable, fascinating, unstable and dangerous as a lit firecracker, not at all the cool, smug, calculating opportunist Mishory makes him here because it's all Preston's acting ability allows.

The only wise move Mishory made was not letting Preston try to recreate even one second of any performance Dean ever gave. The only glimpse of Dean ""acting"" we see is him jumping over a table in acting class.

The James Dean of this movie is like the real James Dean in only one way: he's short.",1379116800,3,1869,4.651515151515151
5685683,1,B00C1LIZI0,"Watching this film is like trying to watch 2 different films that have not been edited yet, it jumps around. totally out of sequence, it just does not make any sense. Only watched 3/4 of the film. I enjoy so called art films or international art films trust me this film does not fall into ether category. At first I thought that this film was poorly edited, but after watching it for awhile it's not just poorly edited its poorly directed.  Just a bad film.",1378944000,2,458,4.3882352941176475

5685687,2,B00C1LIZI0,"Some hot guys and some nice male nudity are all this movie has to offer in entertainment. The storyline is a mess and mostly boring. I don't like the direction that gay films have gone in. There used to be a lot of fun gay movies. Edge Of Seventeen, Trick, Another Gay Movie, Starrbooty, Gay Bed And Breakfast of Terror, and the Eating Out series are the best examples. Now all the gay films that seem to be coming out are mostly gloomy and boring.

5685688,5,B00C1LIZI0,"I have never been able to figure out my complete and total attraction to James Dean, from a pre-teen to adult.  This film is such an eye-opening experience, that it is very hard to put in adequate words.  All I can say right now, is forget about all the Hollywood hype on this man and concentrate on this film's message.  If you are male, gay, and searching the real meaning of life and your porpose in its reality, then I do not have to continue further.  Please, this film as it is, gives one a look at one of the most iconic, poignant, non-conformist young actor of the 20th Centurey.  THE SEARCH FOR LOVE CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING AT TIMES.  NJMJr!

5685689,2,B00C1LIZI0,"The director tried to make an ""arty"" movie and lost focus in the process. The acting is also not the best. Interesting story-line though. Finally some truth about Mr. Dean's private life?",1376438400,,187,4.875
5685690,1,B00C1LIZI0,"That's right, Dean played John the Apostle in the TV production of ""Hill Number One"" and not John the Baptist as The Roommate tells presumably Dean's dad in this too-stylized-for-its-own-good telling of presumably Dean's days and nights before Broadway and Hollywood and Death in the Afternoon on Highway 466.  And why is Dan Glenn billed as simply The Roommate and not Bill Bast who he is really supposed to be?  And why does Bast's - er, The Roommate, sorry - why does his Mom not translate the longish French poem she reads to us, the audience?  And James Preston looks and acts not a lick like the Little B.  Actually, in some scenes and especially in profile he looks more like the young Bud Brando and full on much like Ty Hardin.  But who gives a fig about Ty Hardin anymore, even though Preston would probably do much better in a biopic of that actor.  Vocally, he sounds uncannily like Toby McGuire - and, again, he projects naught of the character and charisma of the Real ""Dean"" Deal.  Stephen McHattie nailed so very much of Dean's quicksilver personality in the 1976 TV movie JAMES DEAN - and, scripted by Bill Bast, The Roommate goes by his God-given name!  Now there was a darn good movie if you want to learn miles and miles more about Jimmy.  That fine flick covered it all, from UCLA to the lean and hungry hustling days rooming with the Roommate, I mean Bill Bast, and it took its viewers to Fairmount to explore Jimmy's Hoosier roots some and then on to Broadway where it touched on Dean's bisexuality with bravery, back to Hollywood and stardom and then we're taken on that final trip in the Porsche Spyder.  ""The Little Prince"" is also in that earlier take (ending with it, as does this current film) but in the '76er it is used to such poetic, incredibly tear-producing effect accompanied by a truly great musical score by Billy Goldenberg and... Wait!  I was reviewing this ""Joshua Tree"" rendition.  Heck, a comparison was inevitable, however - and after writing this I think I'll pop in that earlier effort and enjoy a fairly remarkable film indeed.

The trouble with A PORTRAIT OF JAMES DEAN is simply that it is way too sketchy and barely informative and pretty poorly acted all over and too preoccupied with butt and despite some artsy photography the movie misses the mark by miles and miles.  If you watched this movie and didn't know it was ostensibly about James Dean, you'd probably never realize that it was supposed to be about him at all!  And it wasn't the non-linear structure that doomed this flight of fancy, not at all.  What melted the wax off its wings before it even truly took off was that it was one thing that mercurial and magnificent Dean never was...and that was...boring!",1375488000,14,2722,4.6161825726141075
5685691,5,B00C1LIZI0,"Out of all the films and documentaries I've seen covering Dean's life, this is by far one of the most insightful I have seen. The actor who plays Dean (considerably well, as a matter of fact) gives us a new perception of Dean. He dosen't have James's signature messy pompadour hairstyle (at least in some sections if the film), or his rebel without a cause wardrobe, quite the contrary. Dean is portrayed as he would be in 1951, with neat, slicked back hair, preppy clothing, and his famous horn rimmed glasses. In 1951, dean is a struggling actor living in Hollywood while attending UCLA. He is taking acting classes, trying to make his way in the world of film. The film also tackles the subject of Dean's supposed homosexuality, a tender subject back in the 1950s. The film may be a bit difficult to understand at first, but it gives a very insightful look into the mind of the young, struggling James Dean. He is one of America's most treasured movie stars, and this film provides a look into the time period when he was unknown to the world. An excellent film, vivid, vibrant, yet so gentle and tender.",1375228800,4,1107,4.567839195979899

He portrayed Dean as a young man torn, abandoned and driven to find his center.  The supporting characters were well drawn and imperfect in their abilities to nurture Dean; to help him make his soul complete.  The cinematography was wonderful; the style evoked the times.

So let's call it a fantasy, or meditation on Dean.  Preston is great in his role, ironically creating a far more appealing character than James Dean ever was.

James Dean is such an icon that no matter what we see or hear, we wonder what is true or just a rumor. The film is gloriously shot in black and white, the actors are good and it is worth viewing.  The bottom line is--how much of this can we believe after 62 years have passed?",1373673600,,433,3.909090909090909

5685702,4,B00C1LIZI0,"While Mishory's film moves slowly and has little to no plot, he creates a beautifully impressionistic film that gives what is likely the most accurate impression of James Dean ever rendered.  Instead of going in a biographical direction - most of which Dean fans know anyway - Mishory creates the essence of Dean in the way Monet, for example, created the essence of water lilies, using bits and pieces, sometimes seemingly unconnected, to provide an overall more realistic impression.  I think Mishory asked, How do I present a portrait of James Dean that reveals a more truthful or close-to-home vision of him than a strictly biographical film would?  And I think he answered this question exceptionally well with ""Joshua Tree, 1951"" - by using, with film, the techniques used by the great painters of Impressionism.

I've never been fascinated by Dean himself (though I think he was brilliant in the three films by which we know him), but more by the iconic aura that developed around him after his death.  This aura remains today, in the same way it remains around Monroe or Garland.  So I AM fascinated by the reasons behind this status given to the three of them and a very few others.  Why these few?  Untimely death, perhaps.  But Monroe and Garland didn't die as young as Dean did.  River Phoenix died young, but he still hasn't gained an equally iconic aura.  The only conclusion I've come to at this point is that the reason we cast this aura on so few actors - which we do; we GIVE them the aura --- has to do with a combination of things.  One is our knowledge of their personal lives, true or false; all the tabloid guesses and theories, the stresses and strains, the peccadilloes, the misfit quality of them.  Another is the vision of them provided by the camera.  We often hear that Monroe, especially, made love, in a way, to movie cameras, as though she had a direct and very strong understanding of cameras, almost a relationship with them, and always knew instinctively how to appear in front of them to put across her beauty, her talent, and large parts of her personality and persona: her innocence, her vulnerability.  Watching all three of them in their films, we the audience feel that we KNOW them, very personally.  We feel that they're talking to us, to each of us individually.  We connect to them in a way we don't often connect to most actors.  Gloria Swanson, I think, achieves this in ""Sunset Boulevard"" - and we'd likely cast a similar aura around her had she done this in a greater number of films.  Garland was able to do this even in brief moments.  Watch ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""The Man That Got Away"" again - really WATCH them - and ask yourself to whom she's singing.  It's to you, isn't it?  It IS!  But guess what?  It's to every other person sitting in that theater, too, and each of them would answer this question the same way: she's singing to me.

So, again, how do you make a film about any of these icons that, instead of presenting a dry biography with no sense of the person behind the icon, instead presents the person behind the icon?  You head in the direction of Impressionism.

I came away from this film feeling that I'd met and had a beer or a glass of wine with Dean, and that I'd gotten to know HIM as opposed to the iconic image of him on the movie screen.  And with that, I felt that I had at least a few hints as to why we later cast that iconic aura around him.

This is not a film for everyone.  Even staunch Dean fans may run to it with great excitement and come away disappointed.  It is a slow-moving film because it lacks a direct, linear story, a beginning, a middle, and an end.  But anyone who enjoys films with an impressionistic bent (I think of Tom Ford's ""A Single Man"" - though it has a stronger, more direct story) should enjoy ""Joshua Tree"" for the same reasons I did.",1373414400,3,3847,4.467048710601719

5685709,4,B00C1LIZI0,"The reviews on this film seem mixed but I tried it and I found it to be haunting and engaging.  This is not a linear narrative but a collage of moments and thoughts that form a picture. You have to be willing to wait and listen and search for the meanings.  The cinematography is superb.  Dean is less an enigma but a person who made his own way, who constantly searched for an anchor.  He was not a naf crushed by fame, rather he knew what he wanted and how to get it.  He seemed to be a seductive personality, one of those people who seduce everyone around him.  It's a nice balance of dialogue and visual themes, sometimes brainy, sometimes visceral.  I found myself hooked from the beginning, sort of lulled into it and once in I couldn't escape. I don't know that the film really explains Dean so much as explains why he was unexplainable.  I think in the end he had few illusions about the way life worked.  If you want a standard biopic this isn't it, but if you want to come away with the impression that you've been a room with him for a while, I think this film captures that.",1372032000,31,1086,4.233009708737864

The Film International review best encapsulates my feelings: ""A Portrait of James Dean: Joshua Tree, 1951, renders the finest speculation yet offered. But more than this, and most significantly, writer/director Matthew Mishory has managed to capture an austere beauty of a kind little known and little understood by all but the likes of Baudelaire. Baudelaire, who understood the languorous insouciance of perfect youth stretched out like a cat in the warm sun, of that fleeting moment when immortality seems possible in the morning of life, in that eternal summer.  This is a portrait elusive and poetical in its apparent contradictions, as poetical as the man, more boy, here as courageous as he is fearful, as intrepid and insuperable as he is shy, and small, and bewildered, and alone.""

5685726,5,B00C1LIZI0,"An alchemical rebis of a movie, Joshua Tree 1951 fascinates but for many will puzzle because of its timeless non linear approach to the material. Pulling no punches about Dean's sexuality, Preston's performance shares with Stephen McHattie's earlier 1970's effort the distinction as probably the most accurate of screen portrayals of the young actor's inner drives so far, no easy job.  Often surreal, halfway between Chien Andalou and Marienbad in style, the film moves from black and white to color and back again to give additional resonance to important moments. Despite solid performances from all the actors particularly Preston, Glenn and Rain, this is very much a director's movie where the photography, sound and editing play a major part in its casting its spell ; it's conceivable I think that had the story been laid out in a linear fashion it would have lost a lot of its allure.  If you are a fan of Dean's or of Cinema with a capital 'C' this movie is definitely a must see.",1370908800,6,989,4.811764705882353

5685728,1,B00C1LIZI0,"Don't let the photography dupe you into thinking this is worth your dime! Movies also require a script, believable dialog and characterization. And if you think there is hot sex here, you should also look elsewhere. There are two gay sex scenes in the movie, one which only hints at the act and is interspersed with closeups of James character talking about semen and sucking on a lime. The other was filmed from behind in a stairwell with photography that reminded me of Mapplethorpe. Both are short and lacking in much erotic appeal. In another scene he bangs away at a girl in a bed surrounded by an ample bedspread as we see a picture of her boyfriend in uniform fall off a table. No idea why that was in the film because there is not one ounce of humor anywhere else. You also see lots of backsides, especially floating in one of the executive's pools. But if you were hoping to at least see someone's junk for the pain of enduring this disaster, forget it. Hokey facial expressions completely replace graphic eroticism.

This writer has NO idea how to tell a story. The film is a sloppy mess of vignettes whose attempts at dialog convey either strange bits of poetry, dry information or terrible cliches. This torture tries to be an Art Film, by totally replacing characterization with poetry and one liners. It comes closest photographically to being Film Noir. Unfortunately, the script is so bad it can't sustain even one emotion, much less advance the non-existent plot. You end up not understanding or caring about one person. Even Dean's neglected boyfriend works your last nerve as his constant literary references completely replace normal human emotions.

Forget learning anything more about James Dean here. You find out more about James Dean from the written epilogue at the end of the film than from the entire movie....and no it doesn't end with the car crash it ends when he goes to New York. Yes you learn (not see) that he is sleeping with two movie executives, but you aren't even told who they are.
