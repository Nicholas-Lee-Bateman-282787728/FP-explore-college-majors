1354132,3,B00004U5S3,"I've already seen Extreme Evolution and it's not bad, but nothing great.  Yeah there is a barbed wire match, but that match was just horrible to  watch.  I would've rather seen Terry Funk vs. Sabu from 8.9.97 or Sandman  vs. Sabu Stairway to Hell on 1.10.98.  Those were extreme classics for  Extreme Championship Wrestling.  Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn from Hardcore  Heaven 1999 is too common and shouldn't have been on this tape.  The one  from Living Dangerously 1999 I preferred.  Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka  from November To Remember was ok, but why not put the match from White  Plains, New York?  The tape only gets 3 stars because the matches were too  common and really didn't display much uncensoredness, except for the 5  seconds of francine's left breast :)",964396800,,773,4.742424242424242

Matches-
Match#1:Television Title:Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn:A classic match here. It is a little bit over 25 minutes long and it is truly a great match. Some highlights are a sunset flip powerbomb through a table(!), TWO frogsplahes, and some great moves with a chair.*****
Match#2:ECW Title:Tanaka vs. Awesome:Best match on the tape and Ecw's last ***** match. These guys just beat the crap out of each other the whole match.

Match#4The Elimanators vs. Steve williams and Terry Gordy:Not a very good match at all. The only highlight was the great elbow drop by Saturn.*

1354136,3,B00004U5S3,"ECW Extreme Evolution is a good video but not great by any means. Here's why: The first match between Rob Van Dam & Jerry Lynn is very good, even though it gets off to a slow start. The second match between Masato Tanaka & Mike Awesome is easily the best match on the entire video. Mike Awesome powerbombs Masato Tanaka off the ring apron and through a table to the concrete floor! Mike also goes crashing through the table & lands in a sitting position! I'm surprised that Mike didn't break his tail bone! The 3rd match is the never-before-seen fued between Raven and The Sandman in a barbed wire match up. This match had its moments but didn't make me jump out of my seat too much. Oh yeah, gore hounds should love it, but it could have been better. At the end, Raven attempts to piledrive The Sandman through a table which suddeny collapses under their wieght. The fans boo it and everything. The fourth match up is very boring: The Eliminators vs. Steve ""Dr. Death"" Williams & Terry Bam Bam Gordy. The only part worth seeing in this match is the BIG elbow drop at the conclusion, where Perry Saturn drops an elbow from the swinging scaffold hanging from the ceiling and lands on his opponent. Nice conclusion, terrible match up. The fifth match on the video is pretty damn good: Tommy Dreamer & Beulah vs. Shane Douglas & Francine. A fan gets so pissed off at Douglas that he actually takes a shot at him with a chair! The stupid fan & Shane Douglas fights a little bit in the crowd before security and officials separate them. And near the end of this intense feud, Tommy Dreamer piledrives Francine and her boobes accidently pops out! But nothing a whole lot here. This ECW video was good, but could've been better.",1031184000,,1721,4.484076433121019
1354137,3,B00004U5S3,"""Extreme Evolution"" is ECW's debut ""best of"" collection for fans who have and have not been aware of its insane hardcore weaponry combined with skillful scientific wrestling. But this VHS only features two matches that are deemed great, whilst the others are passable or forgettable.
1.) Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam- Plenty of fans call this TV Title match the greatest of its kind, but everyone is speaking hyperbole here. Sure, we're seeing two expert high-flyers using chairs and tables on each other for over 20 minutes, and many of the spots are fantastic. (Most entertaining scenes involve the Van Daminator, a finisher that has a chair kicked right on the foe's face. RVD does 2 of his classic Van Daminators, and Lynn even does a drop-kick Van Daminator of his own!) But what sorely hurts this match is the huge lag time between spots and several constant mistakes on the part of RVD. (When Lynn crashes onto the floor, RVD desperately tugs him, and then lets him go, not sure what to do next.) So some people say it's classic, but I'll have to say it's just good. ****
2.) Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka- This one's the REAL classic! I've followed Awesome and Tanaka's feud for some time, and everything they've done to each other is insanity and brutality coupled together. This is without a doubt the greatest ECW Heavyweight Title match ever made in the 7 years of video it has captured. It's unbelievable how many chairs die in this matchup, not to mention the two explosive table spots with each spot done by one man or the other! Awesome especially threw everything he ever knew with numerous Awesome Bombs, leaping dives over the ropes, and as you'd expect, a mean chain of smacks with a chair. He even counters Tanaka's infamous Tornado DDT, landing the challenger down two lying chairs! This match would've been my ultimate favorite of all time, but the announcing work is uninspiring and the camera work can get distracting, which is why my favorite Awesome/Tanaka match is from ""Heat Wave 1998"". Still, you'd be a total idiot if you missed this one out! *****++2/3
The next matches will be given brief synopses...
3.) Sandman vs. Raven- Brutal, disgusting barb wire match with a cane and several tables in use. The spots are fine and sick, but the ending is very weak... ***
4.) The Eliminators vs. Steve Williams and Bam Bam Gordy- Hardly any of the fighting here is memorable, but Perry Saturn's 20-foot elbow drop off a scaffold deserved its classic feel. * for match, **** for Saturn's elbow.
5.) Tommy Dreamer & Beulah vs. Shane Douglas & Francine- Passable way to end the tape, as Dreamer and Douglas brawl while their respective girlfriends make a catfight. Highlights here include an out of the ring riot and Dreamer's piledriver to Francine. As you'd expect, a T & A fest. ***
Rent ""Extreme Evolution"" and you'll be happy. But stick around and buy any of the other ECW videos, which are miles and miles better!",1024358400,,2938,4.717898832684825
1354138,1,B00004U5S3,"While Hardcore History and Path of Destruction represents everything that was great about ECW.  Extreme Evolution represent everything that was wrong with it, and eventually led to the companys downfall.  This just isn't comming from some holier than thou smart mark. Turst Me, you will regret buying this tape.
1. RVD vs. Jerry Lynn**
The most overrated match I've ever encountered. They start off with some sloppy mat wrestling that goes nowhere.  The do some fakey flippy flop suff that goes nowhere.  But RVD takes over with some of the weakest elbows and kicks I've ever seen(Stiff Worker, yeah right).  Lynn has enough of this and takes control.  He does some nice flowing spots but takes a bump wrong knocking himself out.  RVD is lost and spends about 5 mins walking around wandering what to do. RVD eventually realizes he has to take over and control the match(NO!!!!).  He hits his same boring spots, that you see on RAW now. But Lynn finally recovers from the bad bump and realized the match is going to hell. He pulls off a sweet spot. A SUNSET FLIP POWERBOMBING RVD FROM THE APRON THROUGH A TABLE!!. A Superplex is botched when they slip off after trying one to many counters. Overall they have a much better previous match but even that one is about ***. Even their match on MTV's Heat was better. This one is slow, sloppy, and has more counters and nosells than moves or even SPOTS.
2. Awesome vs. Tanaka****
Pay attention RVD, this is how you do a spotfest. Loaded with stiff chair shots, brutal table spots, and the Super Awesome Bomb. There are no rest holds, there is no stalling, no poser mat wrestling, just big move after big move. I LOVE THIS MATCH and I LOVE THESE GUYS, they have two other matches that are even better than this one.
3. Sandman vs Raven*1/2
They bleed, they hit each with barbwire. Raven blows a spot, when the weak table breaks by him just standing on it. Weak match.
4. The Elimantors vs. Terry Gordy/Steve Williams*
If the sight of those names don't excite you, wait to you see the match. I can't fairly review this match as I fell asleep, but that is a good indicator of its place in wrestling history.  Oh Yeah, Saturn jumps from a scaffold at the end of the match.
5. Dreamer/Bleulah vs. Shane/Francine*1/4
Some brilliant psychology as Shane and Dreamer work each others legs(SARCASIM). Match High Point: One of Fancine's breasts is briefly exposed.  Terriable Match, but Shane had so much Heat it was unreal.  That man was brilliant, just his inring work sucked.
I sadly only purchased the VHS version.  But it would take a Steamboat/Flair match to save this DVD.  And I doubt Taz/Sabu pulled off one for the ages. The first two matches are worth a watch, but even they have better matches available on other shows. SO ITS A PRETTY WORTHLESS DVD.",1013990400,,2795,4.622222222222222
1354139,5,B00004U5S3,"Out of all four ECW ""best of"" DVD's, this stands head and shoulders above all the rest.  Included on the DVD are truly some of the best matches ECW ever showcased in its brief life.  The first was a 5+ stars match pitting Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn.  I had never seen a Van Dam/Lynn match before this, but heard they were unbelievable.  Those who told me that were dead on.  This match is amazing, and is an ECW classic.  Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka is not necessarily a classic, but is a violent, hard fought match.  Both men are big, yet they do incredible acrobatic stunts and take huge amounts of punishment.  Tables, chairs, and steel railings are all involved, and you won't be disappointed with this brief match in a long long feud between the two men.  Sabu vs. Taz is decent, not great, but interesting to watch in that both men have such different wrestling styles...yet the match flows well.  Sandman vs. Raven is 4 stars, and the Dudleyz vs. Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley is bloody, gory, and full of Holy Sh*% spots that culminates in tables being set on fire.  Unbelievable stuff.
This is the best DVD ECW has put out yet, and is perfect for someone who is a either a casual wrestling fan or a diehard that has never seen ECW.  Definitely a 5 star DVD!",1013817600,,1270,4.380341880341881
1354140,4,B00004U5S3,"This is my 2nd ""best of ECW"" dvd.
It was a very cool dvd with matches like:
RVD vs LYNN: It was pretty good match  with lynn injuring him self pretty bad at first and RVD pulling a great 5 star frog splash with alot of chairs and a nice table break these 2 guys put on a nice show. ****1/2 .Also another RVD vs LYNN match to check out is at hardcore heaven 2000, in my view this match was just as good or better.
AWESOME VS TANAKA:This match is the probably the best match on the dvd or tied with the 1st match. This match is very rewatchable as these 2 big man beat the crap out of each other with chairs, tables, airial attacks and wrestling moves. Highlights: sit out powerbomb thru from the arpon to the outside thru a table, a top rope powerbomb(amazing), a superplex thru a table.
This match is amazing and is a defanate ***** stars!!!!!!!
THE SANDMAN vs RAVEN:This is a barb wire match and was better than i thought it would be. Raven surprised me in this match. Highlights include Sandman wrapping himself in barb wire  and doing a flip through a table to the concrete! ***1/2 stars!!
THE DUDLY BOYZ vs SPIKE AND BALLS MAHONEY:This match could have been better, i was a bit dissapointed at this match i thought there would be more wrestling, it was just a brawl through the crowd  at the end was a bit better as they did some moves and dudlyz do something shocking. Highlights include: spike jumping off a big ladder in the ring  to the outside , and probably the bump of the dvd spike getting powerbombed through 2 tables lit on fire. *** stars!!!!
THE ELIMINATORS vs STEVE WILLIAMS & TERRY GORDY
A boring match which i fast foward, it shouldnt be on the dvd and the elbow drop is nothing. *star
SABU vs TAZ: I really thought this match would have been better and more hardcore. It was good mat wrestling but a short match.
Highlights include Sabu missing a tornado ddt through a table and after the match with RVD. ***stars
TOMMY DREAMER & BEULAH vs SHANE DOUGLAS & FRANCINE:
Nothing much happens in this and it is a pretty boring match. A  fan hits Shane with a chair which was a dum thing to do. Also Francine's PUPS pop out.  ** stars
Overall this was pretty good dvd with Awesome vs Tanaka  being my favourite. Rvd vs Lynn was also a classic but not as rewatchable as AWESOME vs TANAKA.New ECW fans just like me will find this entertaining. The special features are ok with Taz destroying Dreamer  with a tazplex off the crows nest through a table, New jack dive, and Benoit getting his name as the crippler by accidently breaking Sabu's neck with a bad back drop(OUCH)
I recomend this to any wrestling fan who is looking for some hard hitting wrestling.",1010707200,2,2668,4.36491935483871
1354141,4,B00004U5S3,"This DVD shows what ECW is all about in one fine DVD. It has great high flying action from the liokes of RVD and Jerry Lynn and it also has really hardcore action, the best coming from the loikes of The Dudleys and The Sandman. Here is a rundown of the matches:
RVD VS Jerry Lynn (5.16.99)
A great high flying match up which is probably there greatest encounter of all time. Not only doesthis match apply to pure wrerwstling fans it also applies to hardcore fans as there are great moves including chairs and a great table spot=4 Stars out of 5. HIGH SPOT=Great table work!
Mike Awesome VS Masato Tanaka (11.7.99)
Probably the greatest heavyweight title match of all time. This match included chairs,tables and killer powerbombs. A great match that included a great shot of Awesomes terrific Mullet! A definent 5 Stars. HIGH SPOT=Sitout Awesomebomb from the apron through a table.
The Sandman VS Raven (12.7.96)
These two wrestlewrs go crazy to win the heavyweight title. Sandman is the champ who only has the belt to show for it. No wife no kid. Why I here you say?? Because Raven stole them and brainwashed them! Mental match with pl;enty of painful looking spots all through out the match. BRUTAL. 4 Stars HIGH SPOT= Sandman geting crotched onto barbed wire!! OUCH!!
The Dudleys VS Balls and Spike (8.14.99)
Dudleys last ever match in ECW and man they left in style. Balls and Spike were the unlucky duo that were left bloodied and hurt! A brawl that spanned the arena and a EXTRMELY HOT ENDING. 4 Stars HIGH SPOT=Spike getting powerbombed through two flaming tables stacked on one another from the apron.
The Eliminators VS Steve Williams and Terry Gordy (10.26.96)
A amtch to determine the greatest tag team in he world at that time. A weaker match but the ending is supherb 3 Stars HIGH SPOT= Perry Saturn dropping a elbow from a hanging scafold.
Sabu VS Taz (4.13.97)
There Barely Legal meeting which was a grudge match 18 months in the making. Not many table spots but they didn't need them in this classic. 5 Stars HIGH SPOT Taz doing 3 Tazplexs which almost breaks Sabu's neak.
Tommy Dreamer and Buellah VS Shane Douglas and Francine (12.7.96)
A mixed tag team match seems a bit dodgy but in all fareness it wasn't to bad. A riot breaks out but who cares that wasn't the high spot!! Buellah performs a moonsault and oh yeah Tommy Dreamer does the greatest ever piledriver on Francine!!!
3 Stars HIGH SPOTS Francine falling out!!
Good Extras. You will see a great dive by New Jack, Sabu's neck getting broke by Chris Benoit and Dreamer being Taxplexed off a stage through a table. There is also good Bio's and a preview of ECW Anarchy Rulz.
Overall a fantastic buy. I also recommend Hardcore History.",1009411200,,2709,4.634095634095634
1354142,5,B00004U5S3,"ECW is the best promotion of all time! Yeah thats right.

1354147,5,B00004U5S3,"Friends and fans of hardcore wrestling, and genuine wrestling in itself, this is the DVD for you. The now-defunct promotion of Extreme Championship Wrestling was always controversial, down its dying days, and produced many WWF and WCW friendly faces. But in ECW, where television standards and practices weighed little, everything was a little more intense. Taz was darker, Rob Van Dam flew higher, and the Dudley Boyz would still put you through a table, but first, they'd light it on fire.
TV Champ Rob Van Dam VS Jerry Lynn: Many consider it to be the greatest ECW title defense of the decade, pitting a cruiserweight high flyer against a heavyweight acrobat. Fast-paced action follows Van Dam's enormous ego and Lynn's injury, which doesn't cost him the match, but makes him fight harder than ever.
World Champion Mike Awesome VS Masato Tanaka: Superior to many of the FMW matches, these two gave Vince McMahon a lesson on what his wrestlers could do with chairs, and shows progressive high impact to a finale you can feel.
Barbed Wire Match: World Champion Sandman VS Raven: Neither man was famous for their technical wrestling skills, and even if Raven has bored you to death on WWF television, this is that one, special match where the two men used their bodies to entertain, no matter how much blood was spilled.
ECW Tag Champion Dudley Boyz VS Little Spike Dudley and Ballz Mahoney: A testimonial to Paul Heyman's booking tag teams in the main event, this match featured fire, ladders, cheese graters, and exotic wrestling maneuvers that make even fans of the TLC matches sweat.
The Eliminators VS Terry Gordy and Steve Willliams: A weaker match with less high impact and more of the classic, big bully wrestling. Except when Perry Saturn noticed the scaffold hanging dozens of feet above.
World Champion Taz VS Sabu: Joey Style's favorite match, a classic of grapple wrestling meeting suicidal high-flying, two ultraviolent opponents met in a match that wasn't without table spots, but didn't need them.
Tommy Dreamer and Beuluh VS Shane Douglas and Francine: A mixed tag main event is questionable, and certainly pales in comparison to half of the other matches on the DVD, but there are high points. The most sought-after wrestling chest shot of the 90's, a fan trying to start a riot in the middle of a match, and a story told through the match that smells of nostalgia for the simpler WWF days.
But on DVD's, you're paying for the little extra's, because VHS offers the same matches. Here, you'll get to see a young Chris Benoit's entire match against Sabu. It's less than two minutes, because Chris breaks Sabu's neck. If that doesn't sell you, a man named New Jack does a flying splash, off of a basketball backboard, and a poor man is sent off a stage, through tables. There's a few bio pages on the DVD for you history enthusiasts, who want to look up such familiar faces as Rhino or Steven Richards. And to be honest, the ability to click between matches, Joey Styles' introductions, and musical tributes to the athletes, instead of just fastforward or rewind, is worth a dollar, too.",1000944000,7,3103,4.823639774859287
1354148,3,B00004U5S3,"Extreme Evolution, ECWS first dvd. RVD vs. jerry lynn is an awesome show of technicality and high flying, but rvd stalls too much. Awesome vs. Tanaka is a great hard hitting match. Raven vs. Sandman is an ok barbed wire match with a lame ending.

1354149,4,B00004U5S3,"Well, this is the second ECW video I've picked up and while it wasn't as good as Heatwave, it does feature two spectacular matches. I was initially disappointed because the VHS version excludes two matches: Sabu vs. Taz and Dudleyz vs. Spike/Ballz. However, it was difficult giving this tape anything but a positive review after the first two matches. Anyway, on to the ratings:
Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn:
Rob Van Dam works the crowd into a frenzy to open by doing the pointing thumbs. Funny stuff there. Scary moment in the opening segments of the match as Lynn gets his feet caught in the ropes and falls unprotected, face-first onto the mats. Ouch. Well, I guess he's lucky the mats were even there to begin with. The fall seemed to disrupt the flow of the match for a while, but Lynn still gave a hell of an effort and looked great. RVD, of course, was gold as usual, carrying the flow of the match and providing some draw dropping moves. ****1/4 Just a great match from start to finish. I actually liked the tag match with RVD/Sabu from Heatwave just a *little* bit better.
Awesome vs. Tanaka:
This is the continuation of a fued that has spanned two continents. They reprise most of the spots from their encounter at Heatwave (Awesome dive, Tanaka running chair shot), which is definitely not a bad thing. As hard-hitting and brutal as you'd expect. ****
Sandman vs. Raven:
Well, this was my first barbed wire match and I'm sure there have been better ones done by Cactus and Funk. I really didn't like this match at all. Sandman isn't very good. Raven is. The match never really has any flow and I was disinterested after the first few minutes. *
The Eliminators vs. Gordy/Williams:
Another blah match. Gordy and Williams just look terribly out of shape here and the good Eliminator (Saturn), hardly wrestles at all until the end. That was a cool spot off the scaffolding, but the match still only earns *1/4.
Douglas/Francine vs. Dreamer/Beulah:
This match was very entertaining and was just as notable for the in-ring action as it was for the out-of-ring action. Shane Douglas nearly kills a fan after he throws a chair at him. Dreamer piledrives Francine to a HUGE pop as she desperately tries to pull up her shirt. ahem. Overall, very entertaining and a pretty good match to end the video with. **3/4
This tape is recommended for the first two matches alone. I can't wait to pick up Hardcore History, Path of Destruction and Barely Legal. I'm happy to say that I'm getting a DVD player soon, so I'll be able to get every match and the extras. With that said, my only complaint with the video is that it's only 107 minutes long. DVD, here I come!",999648000,,2656,4.581932773109243
1354150,5,B00004U5S3,"Well have watched almost half of this DVD and it is already worth its weight in gold. The presentation on this DVD's is impressive. The matches are unbelieveable. Awesome vs Tanaka is a classic. Sandman vs Raven, is as they say to the extreme. The Dudley Boyz vs Balls and Spike was vintage Dudleys. Chesse graters and burning tables, enough said. Plus of course you can't leave out RVD. The man, the myth, the legend. Plus the extreme moments are unbelievable. When Sabu breaks his neck, that you definitely make you quiver in your seat. Plus Joey Styles is like the third man out there. When a big move goes down, the high pitched squeal of ""Oh My God!"" tears the house down. In conclusion, ECW Extreme Evolution is a must buy. Even for us Canadian boys up north who have to pay in Canadian dollars. Enjoy and I promise you, you will be chanting E-C-Dub all night long.",998006400,,871,4.484276729559748
1354151,5,B00004U5S3,"This DVD explains the reasons why that WWF bought up all the ECW wrestlers and made adjustments to there kind of child wrestling of characters like Doink the clown and brought in the the age of WWF attitude. Also unlike most WWF most VHS and DVD you get entire matches instead of 2min clips so you have to buy the more expensive pay-per-view DVD or VHS. Top Matches include- Rob Van Dam vs Jerry Lynn from Hardcore Heaven 99.  Highlights include- RVD scores two 5 star frog splashes, RVD does a modified Van Daminator off the steel guard rail, Jerry Lynn almost kills himself after landing face first on concrete after receiving a side kick by RVd then falling from the top rope and Jerry Lynn scoring a modified powerbomb on RVD from the apron to a table outside. Mike Awesome Vs Masato Tanaka from November to Remember 99 for the ECW World Heavyweight Title.  Highlights include- A sit down awesome bomb from the ring apron to a table on the outside on Tanaka(which includes Joey Styles breaking away from his catch phrase ), a top rope awesome bomb, and when Mike Awesome kicks out of all three of Tanakas finishers including the roaring elbow. Tazz Vs Sabu-  from Barely Legal 1997. Ive seen better Tazz matches and Sabu matches but the events afterwords with Fonzy joining Sabu and RVD and becoming the manager of champions is well worth watching and ya gotta love the RVD ""I love to work Mondays"" speech. Dudley Boyz Vs Balls/Spike- from first ECW on TNN show was aight. Highlighted by Spike Dudley jumping off the top of a ladder in the ring to the concrete floor below in the beginning of the match and being put through two flaming tables at the end of the match saved the match cause the rest was just an average match(for ECW that is). Also the Extreme Moments was cool with Tazz almost killing Tommy Dreamer with the t-bone tazz plex off the crows nest to a table below,Chris Benoit breaking Sabu's Neck is an event to show non-wresting fans to make them realize how ""real"" wrestling is and New Jack doing a 15foot dive off the top of a basketball backboard through a table.",997401600,,2086,4.527851458885942
1354152,5,B00004U5S3,"Being a long time WWF mark, I was always intrigued by ECW. Unlike WCW, everyone who viewed it hailed it as the best promotion around. So I followed the advice of the reviewers on this site and purchased Extreme Evolution. I was impressed.
 RVD vs. Jerry Lynn: Van Dam and Lynn put on an awsome hard hitting match that is very watchable. The very begining is annoying because RVD keeps stalling and showboating and his manager keeps blowing a whistle, but it picks up and becomes a great spotfest. High spot: Sunset flip powerbomb though a table which explodes on impact! .... ****.
 Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome: Some of the spots are amazing because they are both relatively big men. Hard hitting match, very rewatchable. High spot: Awesomebomb through a table from the apron. ****.
 Raven vs. The Sandman: Really brutal. My first barbed-wire match, so it's unlike anything I've seen. Lots of blood and painful looking hardcore spots, but not enough good wrestling. Highspot: Sandman wraps himself in barbed-wire and leaps onto Raven who's on a table. ***1/2.
 The Dudleyz vs. Spike and Balls: Good tag team street fight with lots of blood, which is good, but it all leads up to the climax... the climax/high spot: Spike is powerbombed through two FLAMING tables, I mean alot of fire! .... ***1/2.
 Elimianators vs. Two Japanese Guys: This match sucked big time, it was lame, short, and the elbow drop wasn't that good for god's sake! It's NOTHING compared to Shane McxMahon's at Backlash 2001! Lame DUD. High spot: Saturn's scafold elbow drop. *1/2.
 Taz vs. Sabu: This was good, yet not great. It was mad stiff, but overall it wasn't that great. I'm sure it was great considering the hype and fued all coming together at the first PPV, but it's not as brutal as claimed. High Spot: Sabu missing a tornado DDT into a table. ***.
 Behulah and Tommy Dreamer vs. Franchise and Francine: Nohing special besides the totally unrehersed ""coming out"" by Francine.  ....**.
 Special features: Not that great. You see New Jack jump off a basketball backboard, Benoit break Sabu's neck (not as cool as it sounds), and Taz throw Dreamer off of a stage through a table. Mick's hidden promo is funny. Overall a great buy. Very good replay value, and very entertaining for non ECW fans.",995846400,,2275,4.768447837150127
1354153,2,B00004U5S3,"After watching the heavily hyped Extreme Evolution on VHS I have to say, color me unimpressed.
 RVD is a terrible wrestler and anyone who could see through his unnecessary flippity flops before EVERY MOVE, could see that. The ""Vandaminator"" is the stupidest wrestling move ever. He throws a chair at his opponent, who catches it, and then the guy just holds it in front of his face while Van Damn kicks it. Try a little suspension of disbelief guys!
 The rest of the movie is pretty mediocre, with the good parts being Mike Awesome's match, and the old clips of when they had actual good wreslters like Benoit. The rest is just watered down BS that they want to make a cheap buck off of. It's definately not classic. Pass this by.",994204800,,730,4.5227272727272725

The Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn match was great...a classic rvd lynn match filled with a few sick spots including when jerry lynn bakes his nose and also suffers a concution atthesame time.the tanaka vs Mike Awesome match is incredible from november to remeber. On reason ibought this was for the rave vs. sandman barbwire deathmatch...this match was a little dissapointing...if you want to see agreat barbwire match get depe impact and watch the tery funk sabu match...the dudley boys vs balls and spike is one o my favprite macthes...it shows those WWF fans what the dudley's were really like before tey got waered down.  The eliminators vs. dr. deat and terry gord is the oly match that i didn't like...it was such a sleeper and nothigngood even happens till the end when saturn does an elbow drp from a scaffold which isn't all that amazing to begin with. he sabu taz match is such a great match for taz. it showcases why he was one of the best ecw world champs...no such a classi for sabu becuase there wasn't as many high flying moves as he normaly would do..the mixed tag math is a little boring but the pile driver that dreamer gives francine is well worth the price of the vieo alone :)  all i n all this is a great dvd to own if you are a huge ECW fan. and there is also a hidden actus jac prom that shows cactusat his best",994118400,,1417,4.404580152671755

Because I am a huge die hard ECW fan and I want some more and I heard they were releasing more ECW videos and I couldn't wait to pick this baby up and I was not disapointed. here are the matches and my ratings
TV Champion RVD vs. Jerry Lynn - this is the rematch from Living Dangerously and what a match at that. the only bad thing about this match is that RVD showboats and brags too much in the beginning which takes up about 5 to 6 minutes, but otherwise this is one of may favorite matches of all time!!! I watch it over and over. This match runs 26:57 but every min except the 1st 5 are classic. this match is worth the price of the whole video My rating: *****
ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka get every single tanaka-awesome match you can find b/c its all good believe me on this one. Brutal Awesome Classic Match My rating: *****
ECW Champion Sandman vs. Raven in barbed wire match this is the first barbed wire match I saw and it's not as good as the Funk-Sabu match but it's still an ecw classic.  My Rating: ***1/2
The Eliminators vs. Terry Bam Bam Gordy and Dr. Death I'm a big fan of all these guys. this is when Saturn was good and not a cuckoo head in WWF. nothin really special about this one except Dr. Death getting Powerbombed on the concrete and Saturn dropping an elbow drop off a scaffolding!!!! I think this match is reconzied for historical reasons though My Rating: ***
Beulah and Tommy Dreamer vs. The Franchise and Francine this is the tag match when Francine has a... slip!! good spots with Tommy and Douglas though and a good spot where a fan hits Franchise with a chair and a brawl erupts. My Rating: **** (a star for the ... slip)
The Dudley Boyz vs. Spike & Ballz  this is an awesome match here!!! good brawl and man is that spike a good bumptaker!! good spots with flaming tables too and a good bloodbath My Rating: ****1/3
Sabu vs. Taz Taz was awesome at this point!! and Sabu had another world title reign ahead of him!! awesome match that set new standard for ECW My Rating: *****

1354156,3,B00004U5S3,"With a few exceptions, this was a good DVD.  I'm giving it three stars for:
- The Perry Saturn Match that was totally lame
- The insane amount of time RVD spends pointing to himself, plus why the hell doesn't Jeri Lynn point the crap out of him and get on with the match?
- The ridiculous cheese grater and staple gun crap
- The bad recording quality of some of the matches - more than one match does not have the ring miked, and it makes the match look incredibly lame.  Miking the ring is key to selling professional wrestling.
- The commentary during matches is really bad.
Despite all that, there's some great bumps and some great matchups.  I probably wouldn't buy another ECW DVD, simply because I don't find it that rewatchable, but I'd rent any others if I could.",992908800,,771,4.3776223776223775

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn: Granted this match isn't groundbreaking, but it is one of the most hard-hitting matches you will see, with two guys pouring their guts into the it.(****)
Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome: Both guys take alot of punishment. The chairshots are downright vicious, plus the loudest Holy S**t chant I've ever heard.(****1/2).
Raven vs. The Sandman: A barbed wire match. That pretty much says it all. A bloody, brutal confrontation.(***)
The Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney: A wild brawl which culminates in Spike being thrown through two flaming tables.(***1/4)
The Eliminators vs. Steve Williams and Terry Gordy: Not the kind of match you think would be on this DVD. The only interesting feature is Saturns elbow drop from a scaffold.(*)
Sabu vs. Taz: Probably one of the greatest matches in ECW's history. It happened at their first pay per view Barely Legal. It helped put ECW on the map.(****1/2)
Tommy Dreamer and Beulah vs. Shane Douglas and Francine: This match would be standard fare except for Douglas being attacked by a fan and Francine ""coming out of her top"" so to speak during a piledriver!(**)
The special features include: Extreme moments where Chris Benoit breaks Sabu's neck, wrestlers bios, and a video game preview. I also found an EASTER EGG! If you go to search mode on your remote and put in title 5 you will find a promo featuring none other than Mick Foley! It's pretty funny and worth checking out.

1354159,5,B00004U5S3,"Not having been able to watch ECW during its Golden Era, (it wasn't shown out in our parts) I immediately purchased this DVD when I had a chance. I WASN'T disappointed.  This is the ECW I always heard about.  Tons of hardcore, hard-hitting action, great athleticism and insane daredevil spots.  THIS IS EXTREME.
Here are the matches featured on this DVD:
1. Rob Van Dam vs Jerry Lynn (5/16/99):  CLASSIC match from their high profile rivalry for the ECW TV Title.  Athleticism at its finest.  Great mat wrestling, aerial action and counter action.  Five stars.
2. Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka (11/7/99):  Another classic feud spanning both FMW and ECW.  This match dispelled any belief that Awesome was not a credible champ.  AWESOME spot and bump fest featuring tables and tons of power moves.  Dudley Boyz got nothing on these two when it comes to tables. As Joey Styles would say, ""Oh My God!!!""  Five stars.
3. The Sandman vs Raven (12/7/96):  Classic barbed-wire match for the Heavyweight title.  Garbage wrestling at its best.  ECW hardcore action at its finest.  You'll cringe at some of the things these two did to each other.  Four stars.
4. The Dudley Boyz vs Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley (8/14/99):  Arena spanning WAR between these two teams.  Another ECW classic with tons of great spots including a powerbomb into TWO tables LIT ON FIRE!!!  Hardcore to the bone.  Five stars.
5. The Eliminators vs Dr. Death Steve Williams and Freebird Terry ""Bam Bam"" Gordy (10/26/96):  Special challenge between ECW's greatest tag team and the greatest gaijin tag team from Japan.  One-sided battle between two great teams.  Highlight is the finish of the match which features an insane bump from high above the ring.  Four stars.
6. Sabu vs. Taz (4/13/97):  Classic grudge match from ECW's first ever Pay Per View ""Barely Legal.""  GREAT match with tons of great mat wrestling, high spots and good ring psychology.  Plus an appearance by Rob Van Dam and the shocking turn that led to the formation of one of ECW's best heel stables.  Five stars.
7. Tommy Dreamer/Beulah McGillycutty vs ""Franchise"" Shane Douglas/Francine (12/7/96):  Decent bout with TA and the obligatory catfight.  Douglas at his best as a heel.  Three stars.
Other extras on this DVD includes:
1. An Extreme Moments Montage featuring:  New Jack's insane dive from a basketball backboard, Taz Tazplexing Dreamer off the stage into tables, Chris Benoit breaking Sabu's neck after a bad back drop.
2. Wrestler bios.
3. A preview for Acclaim's ""Anarchy Rulz"" Video Game.
Here are my evaluations:
Good:  AWESOME action.  In my opinion, not a single bad match on this DVD.  This is the ECW that people always raved about.  Extreme action at its best.  The ""Anarchy Rulz"" preview was pretty solid also (though I've heard the game itself wasn't...).  The Extreme moments montage was also a decent feature.  The wrestler bios were a nice extra, though nothing spectacular.
Bad:  Nothing really...
This DVD is great for any ECW fan, wrestling fan or anyone who likes to see great action.  Is it worth watching?  DEFINITELY.  Is it worth buying and owning?  In my opinion, yes.  That's for you to decide though.  If you do get it though, I doubt you'll be disappointed.

The highlight is the Sandman/Raven barbed wire match, which is brutal, to say the least.  Tanaka/Awesome is also worthwhile, if only to see just how much punishment Tanaka is capable of taking, and Jerry Lynn/RVD is full of amazing stuff, but the match would be much better if it were shorter.  Saturn's elbow drop from the scaffold is impressive, but not enough to save the boring tag match which it caps off.  The tape will have you reaching for the fast forward button in a lot of places, which is a shame, because I know that ECW has better stuff in the vaults than what shows up on Extreme Evolution.",982022400,,716,4.5703125

The matches on this dvd were good, generally speaking. The two best being the Tanaka/Awesome Match and RVD/Lynn. The thing that REALLY kills this dvd is the commentary, it is the original match commentary from the TV and Joey Styles really sucked back in the day, I think this dvd would have been MUCH better if they had recut the audio with Joey/Cyrus or Joey/Gertner. As it is, the Audio is low and when you can hear it clearly, it is lacking, which makes the whole thing look bush league. The other thing that was kind of strange was the ""in between match"" cut scenes have a strange pattern on the microphone that is kind of distracting, and also adds to the budget look of this dvd (perhaps I am nitpicking..but it could have been fixed easily). All in all I am not sure this is the best intro to ECW for the uninitiated.  I give it a B for match choice and a C- for production.",975196800,,1044,4.2462311557788945
1354166,5,B00004U5S3,"The name says it all. Or should I say... the ECW part says it all! Nothing comes close to ECW and nerver will. This video shows why ECW is Extreme. It goes from 2 great WRESTLING matches to the brutal barbewire match between Sandman and Raven. I think Sandman was enjoying it more than me! Then comes a tag-team match where Perry Saturn dropped an elbow from the ceiling! That was basically the whole match, but what an ending... ECW style. The last match was one of my favorite. Tommy Dreamer and Beaula (however you spell it) take on Shane Douglas and Francine in a tag-team match. They start off cursing eachother off and then it turns into the most uncensored match in wrestling history. A fan gets into the action! The highlight of the match (and video), is when Dreamer goes to piledrive Francine...... but pulls her top off in doing so! Overall, I really enjoyed and watched it three or four times the first day.

Raven vs Sandman in barbed wire was great both men risked their lives.  They put on a great match RVD vs Lynn was awesome.  Even though I have that match from the Hardcore Heaven 99 ppv.  It was still a great stiff match.  Awesome vs Tanaka was damn good match I have that ppv also.  Beulah and Dreamer vs Douglas and Francine was damn riot!!!!!.  That match was so wild a fan hits Douglas with a steel chair.  I didn't really like the Eliminators vs Gordy and Williams Saturn's elbow drop was great though.  I recommend this tape ECW in 95 and 96 was great!!! I would recommend any of their tapes.  ECW is great athletes hardcore action and great wrestling.,969753600,,795,4.406896551724138
1354168,4,B00004U5S3,"The tape kicks off with Rob Van Dam versus Jerry Lynn. Although this was a  great match I don't understand why it was placed on this tape. This match  was shown on the very first episode of ECW on TNN so most fans have seen  it. Not a bad match to start off the tape...but also not a great one. I  understand why they wanted to put an RVD match on the tape since he is the  top star of the promotion but if it was up to me I would have put the  RVD/Sabu respect match on.
The second match is Tanaka versus Awesome.  This is a very good match. Both men take insane moves from each other. The  powerbomb out of the ring through a table is insane. Awesome is an amazing  big man and Tanaka is an all around amazing wrestler.
Sandman versus  Raven was not a great match...but I understand why it was placed on the tape.  It used to be impossible to find this match in its entirety. Although I did  not enjoy the match it was still good to see what I had been missing for so  many years.
The Eliminator's versus Steve Williams and Terry Gordy is a  match that has taken a lot of heat from the ECW fans. I guess for good  reason. All four men are great wrestlers but this match was a bit slow. I  must admit I am guilty of fast forwarding a bit. I do understand why this  match was on the tape since it was in the old intro to ECW TV and it was  also impossible to find. The tape could have done without this match.
Sabu versus Taz was a great match at the time. It had good drama to it  and some rather stiff moves. This was the first real grudge match on ECW  pay per view and it defiantly earned it's place on this tape.
Dudley's  versus Spike and Balls was nothing spectacular. I am not a big fan of a  total brawl so I did not enjoy this match. Fast-forwarded most of it. The  flaming table stuff was pretty good.
Dreamer and Beulah versus Douglas  and Francine was not a bad pick. I still think that the Dreamer/Beulah  versus Fonzi/RVD was better.
This is a pretty good tape. I still think  that the Sabu/RVD respect match should have been on it. Also  Douglas/Sabu/Funk from the night the line was crossed should have been on.  Still this is a good tape for newer ECW fans as well as older ones who  never got to see some of these matches.",969062400,7,2241,4.064073226544623

Some of the extras include  wrestler bios, and ""extreme moments"". The entire disc is narrated  by Joey Styles - who does a nice job, and has never looked  better.
However, it does have it's letdowns. I would have liked it to  include more matches. Also, the wrestler intros (music, the classic walk  down the isle) are cut. Styles just introduces the matches with a little  bit of background, then it goes direct to the ring with all the wrestlers  already in the ring and being introduced by ring announcer. While none of  the actual matches (bell to bell) are cut up, the addition of the classic  ECW style introductions, with the fans going wild, would have been nice. I  feel part of what made ECW so popular, was the music, and the entire arena  singing along to Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" for The Sandman, and  ""Walk"" by Pantera when Rob Van Dam makes his way to the  ring.
All in all, this compilation of matches is a good look at Extreme  Championship Wrestling for those who might be new to the promotion. It's  nice to see ECW come to DVD. I hope the next one is even better.",968198400,,1204,4.47926267281106

Jerry Lynn  vs. Rob Van Dam in a 30 minute bout for the ECW television title from  Hardcore Heaven '99--A great match, and the high point of both RVD's and  Lynn's careers. Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka in a show-stealing match  from November to Remember '99 for the ECW world heavyweight title--A  fantastic match as the Awesome/Tanaka feud reached it's peak. Taz vs.  Sabu-- A fantastic hardcore grudge match, and a match that in many ways put  ECW on the map and solidified them as a Fed to be reckoned with in  Proffesional Wrestling.

The Dudley  Boys vs. Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley in a world tag team title  match--Another excellent hardcore match that sees the Dudleys powerbomb  little Spike through two tables which are stacked on top of each other and  set on fire, an incredible spot, and a great match. Finally, the match  which best defines ECW: Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicuty vs. Shane  Douglas and Francine in a mixed tag match-up.

EXTREME EVOLUTION

1.[TV TITLE]TVD VS JERRY LYNN-one of the greatest matches in the history of ECW. These two always deliver when they get together and they do here. The match goes all over the place with some of the best action you could hope for. They both look great here and deliver moment after moment. RVD retains the title in one of the best matches ever. This match took place at Hardcore Heaven 99.

2.[ECW TITLE]MIKE AWESOME VS MASATO TANAKA-this was another amazing match that would see two great rivals go at it. These two were always in hard hitting battles that became classics, this is one of those. The action is vicious as both men seem unstoppable taking crazy bumps here. Awesome would retain the title but it was a hard fought one. This match like the last was excellent and took place at November to Remember 99.

3.[ECW TITLE BARBED WIRE MATCH]THE SANDMAN VS RAVEN-this was a crazy match as the ropes were barbed wire instead of the actual ropes. While not as famous as the Funk/Sabu match this was still crazy. These guys fight threw the wire in the ring and on the floor using everything they can find. This is a hardcore match for sure with Raven coming out on top.

4.[TAG TITLES]THE DUDLEY BOYS VS SPIKE DUDLEY AND BALLS MAHONEY-The action here is crazy with all four guys beating on each other. They fight all over the place and even use tables of the stack variety. There was a Bubba bomb that looked like Balls got his back or neck broke. Speaking of those stacked tables, did I forget to mention that both were on fire and Spike got power bombed threw them. But despite that Balls managed to pull threw for the team and gets the pin and the win for the titles.

5. THE ELIMINATORS VS STEVE WILLIAMS AND TERRY GORDY-This was a pretty good match but wasn't as fun as the previous bouts on this collection Dr. Death and Gordy control most of the match but the ending is where its at. Saturn comes off of a scaffold that they had above the ring for a later match and drops a crazy elbow for the win.

6. SABU VS TAZ-this is the match that everyone wanted to see, and Taz wanted this one badly. These two extreme legends went at it in a match that was more technical then extreme, don't get me wrong it had hardcore moments. This was a great match I don't care what people say, people may hate on it because their first battle wasn't an all out extreme bout. Me personally I think that is what made this a classic, it wasn't what people expected. And after Taz wins this excellent match there is a great aftermath involving RVD this was at Barley Legal 97.

7. TOMMY DREAMER AND BEULAH VS SHANE DOUGLAS AND FRANCINE-this was a good match between these two teams. Shane and Tommy always had good matches so I knew this would be. The action is back and forth and I actually love the ending here with Shane getting the pin on Beulah. Still the most remembered thing about this match was the pop outs from Francine.",1409184000,,2941,4.395220588235294

Like most ECW DVD's you will get a great set of matches, but like other ECW DVD'S you'll find that you probably have some of these matches already. The Taz and Sabu match from the first PPV is on there and the Dreamer beula vs Shane Douglass francine among others.

7923623,5,B00004U5S3,"After being somewhat disappointed by ECW's debut on the Sci-Fi channel, I popped this old tape in my VCR to see something that wasn't filled with 30 minutes of lame skits.

The first match I saw was Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam.  This is Jerry Lynn's most famous match I'm sure.  He takes a nasty fall from the turnbuckle to the floor and lands right on his face, and he's out of it for a little while after that.  Still manages to tough it out to put on an outstanding match loaded with unexpected reversals.

Next matchup is Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka.  These guys had some of the best matches I've ever seen.  Man, they can put on a show.  This match was right up there with all their other ones.  Tanaka tries a tornado DDT and gets it reversed into a spinebuster right on top of some steel chairs.  Ouch.  Tanaka superplexes Awesome through a table.  Great.  Awesome finally ends the match after powerbombing Tanaka from the top rope.  Personally, this is my favorite match on the tape.

Next I see Raven fighting the Sandman in a barbed wire match.  This is without a doubt one of the most violent matches I've ever seen, but then again, I don't watch Japanese wrestling too much.  The Sandman looks pretty fat in this video, but he's definitely as crazy as ever.  He throws himself around into tables quite well in this match.  It gets my attention as well as the attention of Joey Styles.  Both Raven and the Sandman cut themselves to bits.  Blood everywhere.  Crowd seems to like it.  This is as real as wrestling gets right here.  It sure ain't pretty, but it's definitely something to see.

Fourth match I see is a tag match and the only guys in the ring I remember are Saturn and Dr. Death.  Dr. Death is pretty intense, and Saturn's hefty looking partner is surprisingly athletic.  Saturn does an elbow drop from a scaffold and wins.  I wonder what Saturn is up to these days.

Last match is a mixed tag match with Shane Douglas and Fancine against Tommy Dreamer and Beulah.  This is a fun match to watch.  Shane Douglas tries his best to make the crowd mad, and does a good job I think.  Beulah does a moonsault and ends up getting the heck beat out of her.  I was laughing through this whole darn thing.

Even though ECW was some sinful programming, this tape definitely delivers some excitement.  Sometimes I wish wrestlers didn't put themselves through so much, because my enjoyment of the footage depicting their most painful moments makes me feel guilty.",1150502400,,2475,4.485393258426966

Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - Due to the controversial ending to their Living Dangerously match, this match now has the stipulation of No Time Limit as both men started off with series of reversals & counters that kept ending in stalemates early with RVD coming out of it with a cut over his eye with Lynn gaining the advantage knocking RVD off the apron followed by a series of top rope moves such as a dive to the outside, legdrop with RVD between the ropes, and bulldog but Bill Alfonzo made his presence known leaving an opening for RVD to use his educated feet for various side kicks including one driving a chair into Lynn's face while he was crotched on the top rope & another one that sent Lynn called the ""concrete facial"" that knocked him out followed by a running dive onto Lynn in the front row.  Both men traded momentum with hard hitting moves like an Alabama Slam, top rope sunset flip powerbomb out of the corner & later another one off the apron through a ringside table, a backdrop off the top rope onto the floor, and the chair used multiple times with Alfonzo getting one launched at him.  This has gone down as one of the greatest matches in ECW history as it was a very physical athletic contest that saw both men once again push each other to another level that nobody else was able to do.
Hardcore Heaven '99
[Rise & Fall Of ECW]

ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka - As Joey Styles would point out before the match that despite Mike Awesome pinning Masato Tanaka at the previous PPV to win the ECW Title in an impromptu three way dance with Taz, he had never defeated him in a scheduled one on one contest in his ECW career up to this point. There were moments where both men went aerial like Tanaka delivering a high crossbody onto the outside & Awesome doing a suicide dive followed by a top rope clothesline into the crowd. Awesome delivered physical punishment here as well with Awesome delivering suplexes & a snap powerbomb that kept having Tanaka landing on his head, a top rope superplex through the table & delivering an Awesome Bomb that was so impactful that even Styles had to go ""Holy S....!"" A chair was definitely the ""weapon of mass destruction here"" with both men giving & taking shots like a running chair into the face, chairshots coming off the top rope, Tanaka's roaring elbow right into the chair, top rope chair dive onto the face, tornado DDT onto the chair & an Awesome Bombs onto the chair. Just knowing the matches these two had previously (and in the future like the first One Night Stand PPV), you knew you were going to get a very physical match here & it more than delivered.

Barbed Wire Match: Sandman vs. Raven - You saw how dangerous this match was before it got started with Raven having his hair tied back & had his nipples taped underneath his shirt while the referee was wearing long sleeves & gloves along with part of Sandman's pants getting cut along the wire entering the ring.  Both men tried to pull & throw each other into the wire before the wire first came into play after one was kicked off a toe hold into it followed by a dropkick & baseball slide against the wire including being crotched on it & eventually tossed through a table on the outside.  Various body parts from both men were victims of the wire & caused bleeding such as the back when one man charged the other into it & later whipped with it, dropped stomach first, raked across the face before other weapons were used such as the singapore cane & a table while the wire was wrapped around both men at one point.  Usually your limited in what you can do in this type of match but both men were able to stretch past that making this the second most infamous barbed wire match in ECW history.
Dec. '96

Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Balls Mahoney & Spike Dudley - This was from the first ""ECW On TNN"" taping that never aired (another story for another time) with Balls & Spike carrying a chair & ladder to the ring as this started off as a 4 way fist fight with Balls & Spike getting the upper hand with Balls doing a top rope dive onto the Dudleys followed by Spike coming off a ladder as a cheese grader was introduced into the match causing Spike to bleed with Bubba wearing it as war paint while D-Von used it on Balls only for Spike to fight back using a chair & guardrail to his advantage with the fight spilling out into the crowd all the way to the concession stands & back to ringside where not only Sign Guy Dudley got involved but a double stack of tables were set on fire.  This was the bloody extreme brawl that you would expect from these two teams against each other.
""Hardcore TV"" Aug. '99
[ECW Unreleased: Vol. 2]

Eliminators vs. Steve Williams & Terry Gordy - This was hyped up as two of the best tag teams in the world finally facing off against each other however this was nothing more than Williams & Gordy heavily working over Kronis for a majority of the match as the crowd was completely dead for the match past the hot tag to Saturn & the biggest elbow drop the ECW Arena has ever seen but it didn't live up to the hype at all past that as it wasn't a competitive match at all.
""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '96

Sabu vs. Taz - This was called ""The Grudge Match Of The Century"" as this match was build for over a year dating back to their issues going on 2 years earlier to the point where Sabu came straight to the ring without his typical entrance. Both men went back & forth wrestling with Taz even daring Sabu to take his leg at one point before catching him in a body scissors with vicious crossfaces that ended up breaking Sabu's nose. Sabu used this daredevil offense like the double jump springboard into the crowd followed by brawling in the audience while Taz was sticking to this wrestling like the freestyle bow & arrow stretch while also countering Sabu's offense like throwing Sabu off a swinging DDT attempt that sent Sabu through a table. Taz made his clear that he was going after Sabu's previously injured neck with his various Tazplexes that landed Sabu directly on it while even Sabu tried to beat Taz at his own game applying the Tazmission at one point. This did come off as a grudge match with how hard & stiff each other were going after each other but it was the aftermath that had everyone talking as it changed both men's careers forever.
Barely Legal 97
[ECW Unreleased: Vol. 1]

Tommy Dreamer & Beulah vs. Shane Douglas & Francine - Douglas started off attacking from behind with his Television Championship & even getting aerial with an over the top dive to the floor before using his environment around him such as a chair & guardrail to attack Dreamer along with a fan's crutch before one fan decided to take matters into his own hands before making their way back into the ring where both men used a chair to make moves like a legdrop or neckbreaker more impactful.  The women did eventually get involved with both women causing distractions to the men on the opposite teams with Francine paying for it more than Beulah before both women eventually ended up in a catfight while their partners attempted to work over each other's legs with each woman using tactics to save their partners with Francine going to the ""extreme"" to take  down Beulah resulting in Tommy getting his hands on Francine showing us a side of her we've never seen before.  This was an entertaining match as Douglas & Dreamer always had good chemistry with the women playing an important role as well with things on more than one occasion getting out of hand (and clothes) that nobody expected.

RVD vs Lynn the same match thats on Rise and Fall Of ECW,wished they included the beginning intros a little more but the difference is that you get the complete ending of the match with Joey Styles handling the replays nicely. Awesome vs Tanaka great rematch from the title win from Anarchy Rulz 99 where Awesome and Tanaka double team Taz then each other, slightly better than average filler match. Raven vs Sandman a fave for hardcore fans, I think this match was not on the VHS? Sandman is real nasty here getting hung up on the barb wire ring ropes, cutting down the wire and wrapping it around himself while Raven fights to untangle his hair half the time. Raven blows a piledriver through a table which results in a tounge lashing from the crowd but gets the win and a can of beer from the crowd, sloppy but entertaining. Dudley's vs Ballz's and Spike, one of the best matches on the disc some classic ECW! Brallfest all around the arena in and out of the crowd then back stage to the consession stands for a tasty snack. Bubba Ray Dudley turns to the camera wipes blood on his face and says ""Spike..your blood is my blood..."" then the camera guy freaks and cuts away abrubptly. The match ends with spike going through two stacked tables on fire, a better camera angle could have been chosen but it still delivers. Eliminators vs Doctor Death and Bam Bam Gordy. Feels like a filler match but turns out not to be at all, nice to see where Kronus got some of his character gimmics from. Scaffold elbow drop from Perry Saturn rounds out a good and not too long tag match. Taz vs Sabu. Plucked from Barely Legal PPV, a little overhyped but one of the better grudges youll see in ECW. Big main event! Franchise and thong clad Francine vs Tommy Dreamer and Beulah. Gets pretty out of control to say the least, Franchise gets real ruff in the crowd after a fan gets in a chair shot and franchises arm gets caught in the chair. Francine even gets a couple shots on Hat Guy in the front row taking a baking pan from him which she then tries to use on Dreamer. But Dreamer with the eyes in the back of his head routine grabs her and sets her up for a pile driver resulting in the famous nip slip with Joey Styles exclaiming ""Did I just see what I think I saw"" line. Top it off with decent extras- Benoit breaking Sabu's neck,New Jack doing a big drop through a table, Taz Suplexing Dreamer off the Crows Nest onto two tables and you got a great compilation that lacks some of the real boaring matches that whole PPV'S usually seem to have. Main track runtime 2 Hours and 42 Minutes. Back of the box runtime Approx 171 Minutes.

7923628,3,B00004U5S3,"ECW's first commercially-released video is a collection of classic matches hosted by the ""voice of ECW"", Joey Styles. Included on this video are never-before-seen matches like the Raven-Sandman barbed wire match and a tag team title match featuring The Dudleys that was considered ""too graphic for TNN"". There's also pay-per-view matches like the classic Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn rematch from ""Hardcore Heaven"" and Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome at the 1999 ""November To Remember"". There's also a mixed tag match featuring ECW beauties Francine and Beulah with their respective partners, Shane Douglas and Tommy Dreamer. While this video is billed as being the ""best of ECW"", there are a lot of great matches and moments that didn't make the cut while average matches like the slightly dissapointing and extremly overhyped main event from ""Barely Legal"" between Taz and Sabu are included.

I had never seen any ECW before buying this, but this is what I thought of it...
RVD V Jerry Lynn
This is a good match, although it takes a while to get started because of RVD taunting. When it does though, the match makes up for the slow start. There's a nice table spot and lots of chairs. 7/10
Awesome V Tanaka
The best match on the DVD. 2 tables break and lots of chairs are used! There are some good bumps and lots of high-flying moves too. I was surprised at how good this was. 8/10
Barbed wire Match Raven V Sandman
It's bloody, brutal and lots of tables break. It could have been better though, because it's quite clumsy (the last table brakes before the move actually happens). Also, it was paced a bit too slowly. 7/10
Dudleys V Spike & Balls
This was pretty good, but I expected more. Spike jumps off a high ladder at the start, which is cool. Also he gets put through a flaming table, which is pretty good. 7/10
Eliminators V Williams & Gordy
This match was only on the DVD for the end elbow drop. It is not really that high, especially as Perry sits down. Shane McMahon jumping of the Titantron at WWE Backlash 2001 was miles better. The rest of this match was crap and not worth watching making this a waste of space. 3/10
Sabu V Taz
This was very far off the ""most amazing grudge match ever"", but it was still cool. I thought it would be more hardcore actually, although there are some good spots. They use tables and chairs. 7/10
Dreamer & Beulah V Douglas & Francine
I don't know why this was on the DVD. Tommy gets hit with a chair by a fan, but that's about it. At least it's better than the Eliminators' tag match though. Why they made it the main event I don't know either. 4/10
Overall
There were no amazing matches here really, and some of the matches were actually quite crap. I've seen a lot better PPVs from WWE, and this was supposed to be a ""best of"" DVD!",1080432000,2,1905,4.221917808219178
