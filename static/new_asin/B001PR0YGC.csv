3759950,4,B001PR0YGC,"I found the film to be hilarious. I really enjoyed listening to the narrations of all of Whitacre's thoughts: ""I wonder how much a guy like Bill makes...If you do things like clip your nails in the shower while waiting for your shampoo to set, the time really adds up..."" Damon does a masterful job coming off as completely unstable and bipolar as Whitacre seemed to be from what I've read and heard.

My only problem with the film was how silly it got at the end, with the strange accusations that Whitacre was making. I agree with others that the film treated this era as somewhat tedious and hard to believe.

For the record, Tony Hale (""Buster"" from Arrested Development) was very funny as Whitacre's attorney. It's awesome to see Tony playing the straight man.",1254700800,,765,4.617647058823529
3759951,2,B001PR0YGC,"The problem with this movie is that it tries to make something funny out of something that isn't supposed to be funny. I mean, yes this movie is a true story and yes it could have been good. But the problem with this movie is that it tries to be funny and tongue in cheek, and doesn't work. Matt Damon turns in a solid performance as Whitacre, which saves the movie from sucking. The portrayal of the price mixing scandal, which was a big event, was not very well done, and normally would be considered a serious event. I mean, if this movie were fiction perhaps It'd be funny. But this is basically trying to make us laugh about such a serious event that happened. I laughed maybe once in the movie, and other than that this movie was useless. Che 1 and 2 were good but dull, Ocean's Thirteen was total crap. And that said, sorry Steven Soderbugh, but your time is almost up.",1254528000,2,876,4.315151515151515
3759952,4,B001PR0YGC,"While it isn't exactly an all-time classic, or even likely to be on a lot of ""10 Best of the Year"" lists, THE INFORMANT is a delightfully offbeat treat that showcases a truly award-worthy performance from Matt Damon.

THE INFORMANT, if told straight, could have come off as a low-stakes, ""based on a true story"" TV-movie.  Something that dryly detailed how one man, Mark Whitacre, decided to turn whistle-blower on his company, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM).  A story of corporate corruption, one man's jumbled motives and the methods of the FBI in piecing together a case over a number of years.  Mildly interesting, but not too surprising.  ""WOW, companies tries to engage in price-fixing??!?!  Who woulda thought?!?!""  That would have been my sarcastic reaction.

Instead, director Steven Soderbergh and writer Scott Burns apparently realized that they didn't have an inherently vital story on their hands.  But somehow, they were able to look at the surprising and twisty turns that Whitacre took in the real life case, and saw how what they really had was the stuff of a pleasant and original comedy.  And thus, THE INFORMANT manages to tell its little story of corporate corruption...and yet it is a comedy about one seemingly good-intentioned but nerdy scientist/corporate bigwig who ends up being befuddlingly complex.

Matt Damon embodies Whitacre.  He's not just playing against type (as someone like Brad Pitt will do in amiable but surface-level performances in films like BURN AFTER READING or INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS)...he is fully imagining this man.  While all his mannerisms (and his hilarious way of walking) initially seem just a bit over-the-top...the result is to give us a weak, sweaty man who seemingly is simply irate by the actions of his bosses and wants the FBI to do something about it.  He's willing to brave wearing a wire.  He's willing to steal documents.  His wife supports him.  The FBI agents who work with him for years tolerate his idiosyncrasies because he seems like such a good guy (and he's giving them good material).  He is a brilliant dimwit...a great scientist who doesn't seem to always understand his more ""human"" interactions.  And we like him so much, that when the plot takes some unexpected turns...we cannot help but be amazed and bemused...much like his FBI operators.

I'm deliberately going light on the plot details, because, this movie is like an onion, and you deserve to peel it back layer by layer for yourself.

While Damon alone makes this movie worth seeing (and that's not something I've ever said about a Matt Damon movie)...it is greatly aided by some terrific supporting performances.  Soderbergh has assembled a great cast of some terrific comic actors, and given them all straight roles to play.  Just as we expect Matt Damon to play straight with us, we expect people like Tony Hale or Patton Oswald to be goofy and funny.  Yet all play against type.  Hale plays an attorney.  Oswald is a straight-laced bureaucrat.  There are other cameos that you'll enjoy, particularly if you've spent much time watching RENO 911...several of that show's recurring minor actors show up here.

Special mention to three actors.  Joel McHale plays one of the FBI agents assigned to Whitacre.  I had just seen him the night before doing an excellent, dryly funny turn in the new sitcom ""Community.""  Then the next afternoon, I see him playing perfectly straight in THE INFORMANT, and doing a very credible job.  I see bright things for this guy.  Scott Bakula plays the very straight-arrow FBI agent who first gets to know Whitacre, and it was a nice treat to see him again in a role that allows him to shine a bit.  It's a calm, understated performance that nonetheless conveys all the thrill of the ""chase"" that his character feels and all the bewilderment when things change for the strange.  And finally, Melanie Lynskey does a great job as Whitacre's supportive wife.  I'll be honest, I didn't think I knew who she was, but she was so good, I had to check imdb.  Turns out, she co-starred opposite Kate Winslet all those years ago in HEAVENLY CREATURES, and was fabulous.  I'll certainly be taking note of her in the future.

Soderbergh films THE INFORMATION in the colors of the late `70s / early `80s.  The whole movie feels vaguely almond & burnt orange hued.  Not just the clothes, but everything.  The period detail is terrific.  The story seems to unfold at a leisurely pace, but it is filmed and edited to move along briskly...so that you never feel bored.  And Matt  Damon's hair and makeup are terrific, particularly at the end of the film.

The film is not a laugh-fest...it's more of a smile and chuckle movie than a laugh-out-loud experience.  But it has a good-natured tone that I appreciated.  It's a minor movie, to be sure...but everyone gave it their best effort and I believe the best possible comic movie about the whistle-blowing of Mark Whitcare was the result.  Kids will hate this film, but intelligent adults really should see it.",1253491200,2,5007,4.9035714285714285
3759953,2,B001PR0YGC,"Despite all the negative reviews we saw this movie. That's because the trailers looked so compelling, fun and interesting. Also we really enjoy Matt Damon and Scott Bakula. Apparently the marketing department must have watched the movie and decided that the trailer had to be very different from the actual movie to sell tickets. From a video production and marketing standpoint they did a masterful job! However the trailers took the clips out of context and joined together clips that didn't really belong together. It was creative, but very misleading.

The movie was not a comedy, and there were no real laughs. It was a drama, but very little happens in the two hours. It was quite dull. Matt Damon and Scott Bakula were outstanding actors as usual. There were many appearances by actors that you'll recognize such as the Smothers Brothers, the guy who played Biff on Back to the Future, etc. However if I had been watching this movie on DVD, I would have turned it off maybe 1/3 of the way, because it was just not interesting.",1253404800,6,1033,4.738888888888889
3759954,1,B001PR0YGC,"I didn't like this movie. My friend wanted to see it. The reason was because she was told that the characteristics of Matt Damon's character, she has too. She was falling in and out of sleep. The movie was really bad. There were some funny lines/scenes, but thats about it. Disappointed.",1253404800,4,287,4.647058823529412
3759955,4,B001PR0YGC,"If you want to see The Informant based solely on the movie trailers, you might think it is a strange comedy about a man who helps the government take down the company he works for. (That's kind of what I thought it would be.) It is quite a bit more than that. The Informant is in part a comedy and in part a rollercoasting drama that finds its audience constantly guessing the next step. Is Mark Whitacre going to help the FBI take down Fortune 500 company ADM by exposing a price-fixing scandal? Or is the FBI going to help take down Mark Whitacre for some things they discovered on their own? Like the main character of Mark Whitacre, The Informant is more than what is gleaned on first appearance and what starts as one plot quickly turns into another before you know it.

While I liked The Informant, it felt disjointed for several reasons. First, in retrospect the story seems an odd one to inject comedy into and, while Matt Damon did a fantastic job with the comedic bits, I think the film could have more effectively been a crime drama. (I understand that the filmmakers were trying to show how preposterous some of Whitacer's missteps were, but think that some of the more comedic bits were just out of place.) I also think the film's disjointed feel can be pinned on the imbalance between its being set in the nineties while using a Marvin Hamlisch ""elevator music"" score and other film techniques that seem to channel the '60's.) At any rate, some of these directorial choices were, at least to me, questionable and often detracted from the film's story.

Aside from these things, I did find myself quite liking The Informant. The film did a good job at portraying the many sides of its main character, Mark Whitacer, and the strange events that surrounded - or were instigated by - him. The script and pacing of the story keeps the audience intrigued but guessing, only gradually revealing each new secret. The script was very focused and forward moving.

Definitely reccomended for those who like off-beat films like<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn-After-Reading/dp/B001JIE7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn After Reading</a>, that straddle the fence between quirky drama and comedy.",1253318400,,2239,4.997319034852547
3759956,4,B001PR0YGC,"In 1992 Mark Whitacre, the President of Bio-Product division of ADM (powerful Fortune 500 company), became the highest ranking executive EVER to turn whistle blower. For three years he helped the FBI gather evidence of a multinational conspiracy to control the price of lysine. As a result, US government collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from ADM and foreign corporations, followed by prison sentences for three executives. These are events in real life as well as the movie. However, according to the opening credits, the film is not intended as a documentary and does depart from real life facts... The final, cheeky line of the prologue: ""So there!"", gives us a hint that, though the topic and the consequences suffered by many in this story are somber, what we are about to see is meant to amuse and entertain, as well as educate...

As promised, the chuckles do come often, but their source is not your typical one liners. Matt Damon is Whitacre, an inspired choice for the role. His plump, mustachioed and toupeed character comes across so harmless and ordinary you never question why his actions go undetected; even as his concealed recording equipment loudly malfunctions during a covert multinational executive meeting! You laugh at the bewilderment of FBI agents and the DA's office as they are led by the nose by Whitacre's increasingly outlandish antics. One could say ""The Informant!"" has the educational quality of an Aesop's fable: blinded by their desire to swallow a tasty morsel (ADM), the agents cross their fingers and fail to run even the most basic checks on their informant; checks that would immediately reveal inconsistencies in his stories (such as the true nature of his parentage, for example).

The film is not perfect. Based on the way it was being advertised, I expected something in the same category as ""The Pink Panther"". In reality, one would not be wrong to describe it as a combination of ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Insider"", and ""The Duck Soup"" (Marx Brothers). Sadly, ""The Informant!"" never quite becomes as touching, thrilling and funny as those films were, respectively. The makers allow it to drag on a bit in the second half as Whitacre's behaviour becomes absurd. The logical explanation for it all arrives only after our initial keen interest has already begun to dissipate. I also hear some grumblings about the film's muted lighting. Since most of the action takes place in offices and hotels, I believe the lighting is true to reality. Anyone who has spent at least one work day in a cubicle, understands how oppressive that atmosphere can be. Despite these possible faults, Whitacre's story and Damon's performance make ""The Informant!"" worthy of at least one theater trip. Depending on your personal approach, you will see a funny thriller or... a thrilling comedy. Either way, expect to be entertained!

PS: BRAVO! to the filmmakers for sticking to a relatively modest budget ($21 mil)! I am sick of paying to see worthless films with budgets that could bankrupt the economy of a small country.",1253318400,55,3061,4.986301369863014
3759957,5,B001PR0YGC,"This is one incredibly bizarre story! It's also quite funny, I laughed out loud quite a few times. At the end, it's also quite troubling.

I remember following this story in the Wall Street Journal. I now realize I only knew half the story. I recall being outraged at Mr. Whitacre's treatment by the Justice Department for acting as their spy for three years and then being indicted as his ""reward"" for all his hard work in bringing down, single-handedly, a worldwide criminal Enterprise. (No pun intended for you Trekies reading this!) I now know there's so many twists and turns in this story you could easily write the proverbial book!

The end is ironic because it brings up a lot of important issues I can't discuss without spoiling the movie. It really catches you off guard on so many different levels! I even now have an insight into an old friend I haven't seen in many years, who behaved in a similar fashion to Mr. Whitacre.

I think it's important to keep in mind that the real story is ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) (no pun intended again for you Trekies starting to put two and two together!) an incredibly powerful transnational corporation that cost the world's consumers billions of dollars. We get to see at the very end of  The Informant what happened to all the key players. It's very troubling, indeed. The Supreme Court ruled in the 19th century that corporations have many of the rights of a living, breathing person. Too bad they don't get punished to the same degree a real person does!

3759958,3,B001PR0YGC,"Films like The Informant! have been done before, but Soderbergh's clever direction and several brilliant performances from a strong cast keep this upbeat tale of a downward spiral entertaining throughout, even when the pacing starts to slow. Approached almost like a spy spoof, this quirky true life story of a man deluded by spy grandeur and the denial of the severity of his crimes plays out a little like Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, though the lies and deceit go further against our beguiled protagonist living in a Grisham novel. The Informant! does reinforce the theory that truth is stranger than fiction, provided you can find the truth buried beneath all the layers of fraud, duplicity, and misguided intentions.

The industrious Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) has worked for lysine developing company ADM for many years and has even found his way into upper management. But nothing has prepared him for the job he is about to undertake - being a spy for the FBI. Unwillingly pressured into working as an informant against the illegal price-fixing activities of his company, Whitacre gradually adopts the idea that he's a true secret agent. As his incessant lies keep piling up, his world begins crashing down around him.

One of the most inventive aspects of The Informant! is the ceaseless, witty, rambling narration by Whitacre, who draws us into his compulsive mind by veering off in unrelated directions. To Mark, multi-tasking is the key to success, and just as he accomplishes many average chores simultaneously during the day, his narration multi-tasks as well, entertaining the audience with random musings while we're chuckling at his more meaningful actions. Even though his condition is mentioned as bipolarity, the film leans toward a case of an overactive imagination, giving his mentality a livelier, upbeat eccentricity. And it's a favorable outcome, as Damon provides an incredibly interesting character.

The Informant! takes deception to a whole new level, demonstrating an extremely elusive truth, questionable facts, and flat-out lies. Whitacre sees it as ""men in white"" versus ""men in black""; good versus evil. The FBI is once again shown as generally inept, but the lines of decency, honesty and heroism couldn't be more blurred. With a comical covert operation approach, much like James Bond or a character from a Crichton novel turned into a children's cartoon, the film reconstructs a serious situation into a joke-filled, energetic, enjoyable fling.

3760041,2,B001PR0YGC,"I desperately wanted to like this movie.  First heard about the ADM lysine story on ""This American Life"" back in 1995 or so.  Was so enchanged that I immediately went out and bought the Kurt Eichenwald book and must tell you I read the book cover to cover with  breaks only at meal time.  Kurt perfectly captured the steady mental deterioration of an informant in consonance with the importance of the information on world lysine market fixing he was telling them.  I love Matt Damon.  I despise the whole movie writer, director, producer effort to play this as some sort of dark comedy with the goofy wife and the silly Matt Damon.  A much better treatement of this topic is done in the Russell Crowe movie ""The Insider.""  The ""Informant"" was serious material that seemed to have been passed through a lens that says no one will ever understand the role of ADM or Lysine so lets give them comedy as a distractor.

3760060,4,B001PR0YGC,"We have been very fond of Matt Damon since his and his pal Ben Affleck won the Oscar as very young writers for Goodwill Hunting.  We have watched him as he successfully worked himself into the position of being a major action star with the three (thus far) Borne movies.  We like him.  His role in The Informant! is very different that what has gone before.  His performance is really quite interesting and good fun but it is different.
 Damon plays an amiable naf, a brilliant PhD chemist with a trusting heart.  He becomes caught up in a price fixing scandal at his company, the enormous foods products company, Archer, Daniels, Midlands.  He himself has incurred a minor, relatively speaking, peccadillo of his own.  In order to avoid facing the music for his infraction, he agrees to help the FBI make the price fixing case against ADM.  We gradually descend deeper into the mind of the bashful, brilliant bumbler.  The deeper we descend into his thinking the stranger and more devious things get.
 We have to watch carefully to remember that the actor is Matt Damon.  He wears a deliberately bad toupee, a moustache and heavy framed glasses.  Damon creates a vivid character with whom we immediately find sympathy.  Not to give anything away but nothing is quite as it seems.
 TV star Scott Bakula is the FBI man who guides Damon on a nearly three year journey of ham fisted, often comic, attempts to capture the price fixers on film and tape doing their nefarious deeds.  He likes the Informant.  When things start to get pear shaped for the Informant, the FBI man Bakula tries to help and shield the hapless, nave goofball from his own folly.  Bakula is terrific in showing the frustrated virtue of a good man helping another good man who is just too squirrelly to really help.  His careful, understated effort is almost as good as Damons broad, bold effort in the leading role.
 Watch for Dick Smothers of the old Smothers Brothers show in a cameo near the end of the film.
 A List director Steven Soderbergh is back with a commercial film after Che which grossed a paltry $1.5 million and The Girlfriend Experience which garnered a mere $700,000-thats catering money to a major production.  Soderbergh can do the big ones too, with Oceans 11, 12 and 13 under his belt.  He very effectively uses Damon in doing voice overs to explain how very quirky the Informant really is.  This is not always a good idea but Soderbergh makes it work for the audience.
 This R rated film has earned a middling at best $27 million at the box office but deserves more.  The producers spent a tidy $22 million to film this one hour 48 minute feature.
 We think that three and a half stars are about right for this interesting film with a wonderful role for Matt D The Informant!",1433721600,,2768,4.607361963190184
3760061,3,B001PR0YGC,"Had to watch this for an ethics class at UTSA - very dull and the first ten minutes are mostly plain confusing. Overall really mediocre and I'm a little miffed that in addition to the scores of tuition and book fees, I had to rent this movie.",1433203200,,242,4.170212765957447
3760062,4,B001PR0YGC,"Most great filmmakers, such as Kubrick, Spielberg, Cameron, and Tarantino have a certain ""look"", a visual ""voice"" or style that could be characterized as a kind of personal trademark. In film-making, its a combination of shooting angles, set design, tone, atmosphere and acting and how they come together on the screen. After having seen Steven Soderbergh's ""The Informant!"" (and yes the exclamation point is part of the title like a 1970's TV show), I have decided that Soderbergh may be one filmmaker whose personal style may be non-existent. I can't think of any other filmmaker whose work is so widely divergent that if you showed them one after another and removed the name ""Soderbergh"" you might believe these were all directed by different people: ""Sex Lies and Video Tape"", ""Kafka"", ""Erin Brockovich"", ""Traffic"", ""Ocean's 11"", and now ""The Informant!"", his strangest offering to date.

I rate this movie an ""8"" as I found it incredibly compelling and highly entertaining, especially the tour-de-force performance by Matt Damon as Mark Whitacre. Simultaneously, it seemed a film that didn't quite know what it wanted to be. From the opening titles, done in a font similar to a 1970's television show that I can't quite put my finger on accompanied by music that sounds like a game-show soundtrack from the same era, the story is a kind of semi-satirical farce. Unlike ""The Insider"" with Russell Crowe which is a dead-serious story, I am not quite sure if ""The Informant!"" is supposed to be taken as seriously, especially with a music soundtrack sounding like it was lifted from climactic moments of either ""The Brady Bunch"" or ""The Hollywood Squares"". I half-expected Paul Lynde to show up with one of his zingers, although the Smother's Brothers each have small roles. The continuous references to the 1970's in a story that takes place in the early 1990's got a little bit tiresome and seemed to scream ""Don't take me too seriously!""

Apparently, this is the true story of a young executive at ADM, one of the top corporate producers of ingredients for the food industry, who snitches on his fellow executives who are in collusion with other international companies to price-fix. (ADM is now under new management and underwrites many PBS programs, although they still produce high fructose corn syrup to keep everybody at a nice 300 lb+.) The whole story is told almost tongue-in-cheek as if the story is really comedic fiction rather than hard drama. But as the story unfolds, told through Damon's schizophrenic voice-over, Whitacre seems naively detached from what he's really doing. Then, as more is revealed, the FBI finds a lot more than they bargained for in their insider/informant, who was gaining a lot more than his $350,000 per year salary. Not to give too much away, but at one point Whitacre owned 8 cars.

Although Damon's performance is nothing less than brilliant, it was hard for me to imagine anyone could be so naive. Even after having given the FBI the most incriminating evidence imaginable, Whitacre thinks the corporation ADM will bestow upon him the title of CEO, like he is Sir Lancelot saving Camelot. It's the kind of naivet akin to those who believe if they clean the bathroom for a film executive, this is the first step to movie stardom. Uh, not exactly. But at least, as long as you clean the bathroom well, one might maintain that position. Whitacre will probably be escorted out of the executive washroom with a kick in the rear for good measure. And there are probably security guards on the CEO's floor. So much for the knight on white horse. Which may speak to the point of the entire film: Whitacre doesn't seem to take himself too seriously so why should the story?",1432944000,,3712,4.888888888888889

3760070,5,B001PR0YGC,"This movie may be one of the most bizarre character studies I've seen in a while. And I think what makes it stand out for me is how Steven Soderbergh set out to present Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon). The man, an executive/bio-chemist and inevitable whistleblower, is displayed before the audience as a hapless buffoon who manages to delay his own professional demise within his company, ADM, by constructing a house of cards propped up by one astonishing deceit after another.

When ADM, which is complicit in an international price-fixing scheme, garners the attention of the FBI over an extortion scheme, Whitacre begins to see himself as a possible patsy for ADM's illegal endeavors and becomes an informant for the FBI against ADM. But while he's feeding FBI agents, Brian Shepherd (Scott Bakula) and Bob Herndon (Joel McHale), with wire-tapped meetings among the playmakers in the price-fixing, he's also withholding information from them pertaining to his own blithely ignorant and misguided attempts to divert attention from him, as well as his own illegal activity of a different nature.

And the craziest bit is that this is somehow inspired by true events, Mark Whitacre is a satirized characterization of a real person. Oh dear lord.

I think what saves this movie from drowning in its own drool is that it's played for laughs, rather than treat it like a suspenseful corporate espionage film. Matt Damon does a downright amazing job of making this guy seem real and relatable, while simultaneously showing the comically absurd antics and behavior of a white-collar criminal.

Another saving grace is the high caliber casting choices. Matt Damon is the comic relief fixture of the film, surrounded by straight men off which to bounce his inanity. The arguable brilliance of the casting choices comes from having so many comic actors and comedians cast as those straight men, avoiding any kind of hammy portrayals and giving entirely sincere performances. Joel McHale, Tom Papa, Patton Oswalt, Andrew Daly, Ann Cusack, Tony Hale, and even Tom and Dick Smothers--yes, the Smothers Brothers are in this movie--are cast as the characters who basically look at Matt Damon's character with gaping-mawed amazement at the biosphere of bulls*** he's created.

The movie taps into that kind of cringe-worthy style of comedy seen in ""The Office"", but given in a charming cinematic feel. And the score through the movie is just the cherry on top, with its peppy ""model employee"" jingles at one point to fades into ""James Bond"" or ""Laugh In"" theme music the next.

Matt Damon may have gotten some measure of praise for his role in Invictus, but The Informant should have been the movie to earn him the real praise.",1421193600,,2709,5.022271714922049

3760080,3,B001PR0YGC,"To dream, perchance to sleep There are many, many people who thought Inception was the simply
one of the best movies ever. Likely you are male, 13-24 years old. Clearly Im in the minority here (oh,
and a little beyond that age demographic). Although I have to give the film credit for its use of
interesting special effects, it misses the mark somehow.
Maybe thats because it didn't know its mark.
Was it an action movie, a cerebral exploration, or video game? During some scenes, I wondered why I
wasnt handed a joy stick with my ticket stub. Im on this level, then that level, will I break through to
the top level? Will I get shot at, blown up, or just plain sent into limbo? I love the sent into limbo part
that part rocks!
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, a skilled thief who uses the technology of his day to enter the dreams of
his victims. He is given what seems to be the last chance he might have to redeem himself and see his
children again. But the task is formidable, to enter a dream and actually insert an idea into the victims
mind (called inception).
The problem is Im not swept away by the scenes in what are supposed to be dreams. And Im not
looking for the colorful dreamscapes in a film such as What Dreams May Come (1998) which also
didnt hit its mark. But the dream sequences here were more like a dark night in Gotham (yes, I think we
all know by now that Christopher Nolan of Dark Knight fame was the director behind this one).
Although the acting was excellent, some of the parts were miscast. Ellen Page as DiCaprios assistant
was perhaps not the most convincing pick. And Marion Cotillard, who won the Academy Award for Best
Actress for her work in La vie en rose, was wasted here in a role as a recurring subconscious vision of
DiCaprios wife. I simply did not feel for her character or the chemistry between the two.
It would be an easy criticism to say the film was scattered. After all, you're taken through dream within
dream within dream. And when you fail to facilitate suspension of disbelief with this moviegoer, all of
that seems implausible! So the real problem is that I didn't get swept away by the entire filmnot just
its dream sequences. Still, if you go with the views of the clear majority, you will enjoy this film.",1408406400,2,2258,4.41726618705036

Even more so when our central character is a doctoral biochemist engaged in fraud. I thought that the actors, directors and writers all did the best job possible in making all that a little more understandable by taking that whole convoluted mess, lightly, if not humorously.

I thought they should have invested their money in making a better movie like The Departed 2 although it seems impossible given all the characters were killed off they could still come up with something better than this piece of crap. I don't know why Matt would sign on for something like this. I guess every movie can't be quite about the level of a Departed but I know it could be a lot better.

  I guess the movie was supposed to be funny but I never laughed once. I was just happy when I left the theater and could pretend I never saw it.

So Soderbergh was clearly looking for a comic feel, in timing, pacing, and reaction among the cast members.  The one thing that this technique sacrifices for this, in comparison to the book, is a little of the empathy the book's author showed to Mark in the scene where he agrees to go to the hospital for treatment of his under-treated mental illness, no doubt of which has some bearing on his more outrageous and self destructive actions.

3760114,5,B001PR0YGC,"""The Informant"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: What was Mark Whitacre thinking? A rising star at agri-industry giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Whitacre suddenly turns whistleblower. Even as he exposes his company's multi-national price-fixing conspiracy to the FBI, Whitacre envisions himself being hailed as a hero of the common man and handed a promotion. But before all that can happen, the FBI needs evidence, so Whitacre eagerly agrees to wear a wire and carry a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase, imagining himself as a kind of de facto secret agent. Unfortunately for the FBI, their lead witness hasn't been quite so forthcoming about helping himself to the corporate coffers. Whitacre's ever-changing account frustrates the agents and threatens the case against ADM as it becomes almost impossible to decipher what is real and what is the product of Whitacre's rambling imagination. Based on the true story of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history.

The cast led by Matt Damon (as Whitacre) is excellent! The directing and cinematography (under the name Peter Andrews) by Steven Soderbergh (who also directed and did the cinematography to ""Ocean's 11, 12, & 13"" (2001, 2004, & 2007) (all three also starred Damon and George Clooney, the first two also starred Julia Roberts), ""Traffic"" (2000), ""Out Of Sight"" (1998, also starring Clooney), ""Solaris"" (2002, also starred Clooney, and also wrote the screenplay and did the film editing under the name Mary Ann Bernard) & ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000, also starring Roberts) is excellent! The screenplay (based on the book by Kurt Eichenwald, who also produced) by Scott Z. Burns (who also wrote the screenplay to ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007, which also starred Damon) is excellent!

The music by Marvin Hamlisch (who also did the music to ""Three Men And A Baby"" (1987) is excellent! The film editing by Stephen Mirrione (who has been working with Soderbergh since ""Traffic"") is excellent! The casting by Carmen Cuba (who was a casting associate on ""Erin Brockovich"") is excellent! The production design by Doug J. Meerdink (who also did the art direction to ""Ocean's Thirteen"") is excellent! The art direction by Billy Hunter (who also did the art direction to ""Ocean's Thirteen"" & did the set decoration to ""Star Trek"" (2008), ""Ocean's Twelve"", & the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010) & ""Sucker Punch"" (2011) & David Scott is excellent! The set decoration by Daniel B. Clancy (who also did the set decoration to ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), the upcoming ""Couples Retreat"" (2009) & ""Red Dawn"" (2010) & Curtis Maneno is excellent! The costume design by Shoshana Rubin is excellent!

This is an excellent dramedy that keeps you intrigued and laughing at the same time. This is one of the best films of the year, so far. Damon gives an eccentric performance that works to his advantage.",1369526400,,2876,5.141025641025641

3760117,4,B001PR0YGC,"""Following along a vein of offbeat dark comedies like Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy and Richard Linklater's Bernie, it was no surprise to me that The Informant!, this complex allegory about the dangers of agency and corporate bureaucracy. The film as a whole might seem a bit ordinary at first but it certainly delves into some unique artistic territories and vein with its highly quirky yet cynical use of humour, extraordinarily crafted musical score (that reminds you that this could be from the 1970s film from Robert Altman), and well-crafted, nuanced performances from Damon who plays former whistle-blower/Archer-Daniels-Midland vice-president, Mark Whitacre, and even a commendable one to Joel McHale who plays one of the FBI agents. The thematic treatment of the film is strange at best and does not following much in the way of cliche or come across as being predictable. Every twist and turn is coming through and the audience engages with the passive-aggressive bipolar Whitacre as he tries overcoming his paranoia. If you see on its own for what it is, along with the already complementary deleted scenes on the DVD, it may a very interesting film but a very boring one and unlike Michael Clayton, this one seems to shine a light on something daring, darkly humorous, and unique so at best take times to repeat certain scenes to connect the dots. After that, you'll eventually feel the wrath of Soderbergh communicating to the most perplexed yet most sane audiences.""",1362873600,,1487,5.073469387755102

3760134,5,B001PR0YGC,"This is one incredibly bizarre story! It's also quite funny, I laughed out loud quite a few times. At the end, it's also quite troubling.

I remember following this story in the Wall Street Journal. I now realize I only knew half the story. I recall being outraged at Mr. Whitacre's treatment by the Justice Department for acting as their spy for three years and then being indicted as his ""reward"" for all his hard work in bringing down, single-handedly, a worldwide criminal enterprise. I now know there's so many twists and turns in this story you could easily write the proverbial book!

The end is ironic because it brings up a lot of important issues I can't discuss without spoiling the movie. It really catches you off guard on so many different levels! I even now have an insight into an old childhood friend, I haven't seen in many years, who behaved in a similar fashion to Mr. Whitacre.

I think it's important to keep in mind that the real story is ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) an incredibly powerful transnational corporation that cost the world's consumers billions of dollars. We also get to see at the very end of The Informant what happened to all the key players. It's very troubling, indeed. The Supreme Court ruled in the 19th century that corporations have many of the rights of a living, breathing person. Too bad they don't get punished to the same degree a real person does!

Certainly it has a clear and definite design-style, chosen to create an impression of being a period piece, think: Catch me if You Can, Down with Love or the Pink Panther and in terms of design nomenclature you would be in the right ballpark. Funny then, that this film is set in NINETEEN NINETY-TWO! Clearly the costume designer, productions designer, make-up artist and set designer were absent from a few crucial meetings somewhere along the line because the whole balance of the film is way out of kilt and abound with horrible mixed-metaphors and blatant inaccuracies. Couple that to a low-budget cast, uninspiring performances all-round, drab dialogue and you get what you get, this.

To me, this film has no real defining merit, there is nothing to demonstrate why the studio chose to adopt this screenplay over countless thousands of others they had access to. This film really has the feeling that the studio wanted to have a Soderbergh film on its books and he (being busy) was only able to fit this in between other projects; real projects which he was focused on and where he was in the zone.

To summate: this film should be consigned to the B list of film where it belongs. If you see it advertised on television and you have time to kill, by all means watch it. However, in terms of a serious purchase or rental with your hard-earned, I wouldn't.",1327190400,,1574,4.72

3760144,4,B001PR0YGC,"My daughter and I went to see The Informant, staring Matt Damon. We loved it. It was very entertaining. I have to say that we got a lot more out of it because we listened to the episode on NPR's This American Life about Mark Whitacre, the real-life character upon which this movie was based. The movie is not as detailed as the story, for obvious reasons.

The Informant's Executive Producer is George Clooney. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, The movie version of this true story manages to put a somewhat humorous spin on a very serious subject - corporate corruption. Matt Damon does such a great job acting here, that you never really think of the character as Damon acting. He even gained a bunch of weight to get a middle aged spread for the role, a common thing for actors to do these days. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, including Scott Bakula and even the Smothers Brothers!

Imagine a corporate executive (Whitacre) who goes to the FBI (because his wife says she will if he doesn't) to turn in his colleagues at Archer Daniels Midland Company for price fixing. Whitacre becomes an informant for several years working magic for the FBI, completely fooling those who work in his company as well as business associates from around the world. But of course there's a twist. Whitacre is not being completely honest with the FBI, his wife or himself. Despite all this he is a brilliant and totally likeable guy.

You'll walk away from this movie saying to yourself, ""OMG, this is a true story, and Mark Whitacre is a real person, a sociopath who has no trouble lying to the FBI!"" You'll also be thinking about how much we don't know about the companies America relies upon for food and other essentials and just how corrupt corporations can be. Oh yeah, and you'll be pondering just how it is that a man's wife can bear to stand by him through a lifetime of lying and cheating.

So either read the book or listen to the NPR This American Life episode about it, and then go and see the movie. It will make you think a lot about corporate America, the stocks you buy and your hard-working corporate executive friends. Do you really know who they are?

3760145,3,B001PR0YGC,"This is a great story that needs to be told, but the directing and casting were lacking.  They really make Decatur out to be a little hicksville.  While in the middle of the cornbelt, it is only a few hours from Chicago.",1315699200,,220,4.214285714285714
3760146,4,B001PR0YGC,"This is a good somewhat off-beat movie but you have to pay attention to follow the twists and turns.  Matt Damon plays Mark Whitacre, an employee of a major company that is engaging in price fixing.  He turns informant and works with the FBI for over two years to collect the conspirators on tape.  As it turns out, Whitacre has issues of his own, which complicates matters.  His character and motivations are questioned and the viewer is held in some suspense about the purity of his intentions.  It is difficult to give a detailed review without giving away the surprise parts of the story, which is in fact based on actual events.

The soundtrack, written by Marvin Hamlisch, provides a spoof like sense to the drama, as the almost cartoonish track follows Whitacre's doings.  In addition, we are often privy to Whitacre's thoughts in the middle of scenes with someone else.  These two elements make the movie somewhat discordant, and I can see how some viewers could be put off by it.  Also, Whitacre's wife is played like a stereotype of the stand-by-your-man wife, which makes the role seem unreal.  The FBI agents were at times also too artificial, as were some of the other bit players, especially the ones who played lawyers.

I think overall the film was a credible attempt to portray a complicated person in the midst of a crisis with various dimensions.  The saving grace for the movie is Matt Damon, who apparently put on some weight for the role, and who made Whitacre very real.",1307404800,,1493,4.7
3760147,5,B001PR0YGC,"At first I thought ""The Informant!"" would be another expose of corporate crime.

It plays like one--with a jittery voiceover by Matt Damon and realistically-ordinary shots of Decatur, Illinois factories, farms, and houses.

But it isn't--or isn't completely--an expose.

It's as much a character-study of Whitaker (Damon) as a trashing of corporate malfeasance.

The first tipoff is the music.  It's like cartoon-music, zany and manic and lighthearted.  It's so lighthearted that it's almost loony.

And that's the way Whitaker is, too.  He is brilliant, but also Eagle-Scout optimistic and wackily cheerful.

The movie does a good job of explaining a complex fraud--from the corruption of bioengineering to pricefixing to million-dollar-kickbacks.

But it does even better showing the spiral of Whitaker into delusions (that he might sell out ADM for fraud, and then become CEO, for example) and self-delusions (he tells his gardener that he is Double O Fourteen--twice as smart as Double O Seven).

Whitaker comes across as a person who believes EVERYTHING, and who confidently expects others to do the same, especially when he is spinning grandiose lies.

Most of the time, he is right.

Damon does a perfect job with the role--he is stiff, walks awkwardly, carries too many pounds, has Trump-horrible hair, and even goes BALD in prison--and of course, in the end, is even able to look on prison cheerfully as a learning experience.

He created an interesting portrait of a fellow who wasn't quite reading all the cards right (or was he?) and the film is a journey of interpreting and then reinterpreting your interpretation of this character Marc Whitaker.  If nothing else I found the film entertaining.  Loved the light and airy soundtrack as well, adding levity to an otherwise over-wrought situation.  I felt this movie moved mostly at a fairly quick and engaging pace though it became somewhat distressing to see how far gone our protagonist really was by the end.  It's a white-collar drama and Damon plays a pretty good dweeb.  It's almost black humor at times.  It may have become longish towards the end, and it never rectified the protagonist which may be what some found disappointing, but overall the movie is still entertaining enough and worth a watch.

3760160,2,B001PR0YGC,"Right from the start this film hits all the wrong notes and never really recovers. Rather mystifyingly, director Steven Soderbergh decides to treat the story of whistle blower Mark Whitacre as a 1960s comedy and as a result he strips out all the tension. Whitacre, who despite his faults must have gone through 17 versions of merry hell, carried an FBI wire for two and a half years to reveal how his employer (massive U.S. corporation ADM) was fixing the prices of substances used in foods around the world. The potential for a gritty industrial espionage story is there -- will he be caught? will he crack under the strain? -- and yet Soderbergh throws it away with wacky 1960s style upbeat music and psychedelic 1960s types fonts for the purple words that appear on the screen to let us know where the scenes are taking place. Here's the first problem -- the film is set in the first half of the 1990s.

  Damon puts in an admirable performance when faced with what is a poor script. None of the characters escapes from the realm of cliches and the further we go into the film, the more confusing it becomes. We slowly learn that Whitacre was himself up to no good and at the same time he was carrying an FBI wire, he managed to steal $9 million in the form of backhanders and bribes. But that isn't funny and Soderbergh botches the job of trying to keep us laughing while letting us see that our ""hero"" isn't necessarily all that heroic. What is the story about? Are we supposed to be amused by a funny film where the wacky yet loveable main character has a few ""personal flaws"" or are we supposed to be sympathising with a man way out of his depth who is clearly deluded and slowly losing his grip on reality? The director wants to have it both ways and of course fails on both scores, so the audience is left bemused. The viewer is not helped by some frankly incoherent script writing. In one scene an FBI official seems to suggest Whitacre had been caught up in an infamous Nigerian style begging letter scam and was stealing the $9 million to cover his losses elsewhere. But we never return to the topic and it becomes one of the many loose strings that devil this movie.

I felt that this movie could have been good if they had tried to focus more on the twisted and warped mind of the lead character rather than trying to make Damon a comic.  This movie fell very flat.  By the end, I just wanted the movie to end and to have some resolution - it didn't matter what that was.  I just wanted the movie to end!  It was almost like they were trying to make a movie like Fargo, but didn't even come close.

For an eccentric changeup I recommend the quirky THE INFORMANT!, a (slightly) dark comedy about an ""Aw shucks"" nerd who helps bring down an international price-fixing cabal (on food derivatives, for cryin' out loud).  Based on a true story, this movie quietly entertains while giving the viewer a sound dose of corn pone (pun intended).

THE INFORMANT! is carried delightfully on the pudgy shoulders of Matt Damon, playing ADM junior exec Mark Whitacre.  Good ol' Mark looks like someone you would rub elbows with at an ice cream social, and his sophomoric view of the corporate world is matched only by his cluelessness.  Cooperating with the FBI (he gets wired) he gathers evidence to put his coworkers away. . .then expects his employer to reward him for his efforts.  And Damon does all of this with a quirky, ""gee willickers!"" delivery that had me in stitches; as the movie grows even darker--with Whitacre growing ever more delusional--the jaw-dropping, disbelieving looks of his FBI cohorts (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) are priceless.  Four stars instead of five, due to needless meandering; THE INFORMANT! indeed proves that quirky can be good for you.

The combo of Mark Whitacre's sincere cluelessness (""I'll bring down the company and then get to run it!""), hubris, and a stunning ability to believe his own whoppers was absurd . . and fascinating because it's all (or mostly) true.

The alternately stunned and incredulous looks on various FBI officials' faces as each new, game-changing ""minor"" detail surfaced was priceless, and was probably not far from the real agents' responses. I looked up the real Mark Whitacre and my first impression is that he really is that bass-ackwards. And now he's the COO of a different company. You can't make that stuff up.

This film was generally appreciated by professional critics and tends to polarize viewers. To me this is akin to a stamp of approval . . Soderbergh committed to specific storytelling and visual styles that won't appeal to everyone. Going for mass appeal when shooting quirky material like this (high-concept it ain't) typically results in a generic, forgettable experience that earns a lot of ""It was OK"" verdicts. ""The Informant!"" is deservedly getting ""loved it"" and ""blows big time"" votes in equal measure.

If you tend to enjoy understated, unique critical hits that confused and frustrated your average audience member, this is worth two hours. If you tend to dismiss the snooty critics' pronouncements and only enjoy pratfalls, one-liners, or underlined, rim-shot comedy, then don't waste your time.

3760186,4,B001PR0YGC,"""The Informant"" is a fun movie.  My family watched this film recently and found it funny and engaging.

""The Informant"" is based on a true story of an executive of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), a huge multinational corporation.  The executive, Mark Whitacre, played by Matt Damon, observes colleagues engaging in what he considers illegal behavior.  Mark decides to report the behavior to the FBI and become their informant.  Mark acts as an FBI spy for nearly three years.

What happens with Mark as a spy is a bit like a mystery story with information and plots frequently changing.  Mark continues as a spy, but his task keeps modifying and the information he recovers is a continuing surprise to The FBI and the movie audience.

Matt Damon is wonderful as Mark Whitacre.  I have seen Matt in several other movies but was unaware of his comedic talent.  The story is told with the main character  narrating the action nonstop.  As Mark tells us about events he continually adds asides commenting on the events around him and his impressions of life.  These side comments are hilarious.  The film is worth seeing for the asides alone.

-Director Steven Soderbergh on the narration of ""The Informant!"" to [...]

Oh, I can imagine the movie without it.

Soderbergh is too adept as a filmmaker, too set on corrupting the camera or turning a story on its head, that, when offered a terrific screenplay about one of America's great (unknown) corporate scandals, he immediately aims to make it unlike ""The Insider."" Why? That's Soderbergh. He turns Che Guevara into an inscrutable four-hour opera and a George Clooney/Cate Blanchett pairing into the dry, middling ""The Good German.""

Because people have stopped saying no to Soderbergh's ideas - some brilliant, some a waste - ""The Informant!"" is half the film it could be, and half the film the director could make. A shame. Not even a terrific, locked-in performance from Matt Damon saves it.

From 1992-1995, corporate vice president Marc Whitacre (Damon) wore a FBI wire and blew the whistle on corn processor Archer-Daniels-Midland for conspiring - on a global scale - to fix prices. That's the short story. The longer one reveals remarkable duplicity - you almost have to admire it - in which the crime Whitacre commits (and the egomania he embraces to hide it) almost surpasses, you know, global price fixing. He lies to his long-suffering wife Ginger (Melanie Lynsky), the two FBI agents (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) who vouch for his undercover work, judges, lawyers, TV hosts, journalists, parents, doctors and, good measure, himself.

In part because two different books written about the ADM scandal arrive at different conclusions, ""The Informant!"" hedges on just why Whitacre lied and what ADM knew. Scott Burns' literate script is dense with locations, depositions and negotiations. It's subtle, too, in how it sows a single clue in one scene, only to have it bloom later into a lush, devastating fiction.

But Soderbergh treats it like a game show, a joke, a funhouse mirror, burying the story underneath Marvin Hamlisch's frolicky musical score and a high-contrast look that washes out the edges of the frame and turns everyone's face beet red. The narration - about bugs, polar bears, Tokyo, chicken legs and any other number of topics - is initially clever. Then strange and unlikely - especially the Tokyo comment. Then pure conceit, a trinket rolling around on a countertop.

Damon imbues Whitacre with a sort of detached hubris, as if the exec is watching himself inside a movie, choosing to deepen the plot rather than simplify his life. Some of Whitacre's choices appear inexplicable except when viewed through the prism of inviting trouble for the thrill of it. Soderbergh's direction works against the performance, but Damon is just as squirmy, treacherous and weird here as he was in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Bakula is an odd choice for the lead FBI agent, while McHale, a comedian who hosts ""The Soup,"" is badly miscast as the other.

""The Informant!"" chooses tone over theme, and thus the rage of the story - perfectly well-to-do men insisting, through extraordinary corruption, they must do better at the expense of others - is lost amidst the distractions Soderbergh creates.",1272672000,2,3484,4.962264150943396

He's a head case who lies, probably suffers from bi-polar disorder, invents, forges, and lives in multiple universes. It's almost like a situation comedy gone berserk. The movie can't decide what it wants to be, and it can't find a tone that suits it.
 I found the movie to be annoying, disconcerting, and frivolous. I was reminded of two Russell Crowe movies, one about another whistle-blower (in the tobacco industry) and ""A Beautiful Mind"" about a man with a serious mental disorder, both more serious and better movies.
 The Archer Daniel Midlands Company, the agri-industry giant, got itself in trouble with price fixing and other corrupt practices, and Whitacre, a company executive, became a whistle-blower. He allies himself with the FBI and wears a wire. Unfortunately they find out he's a pathological liar, and he himself is guilty of taking huge bribes ranging in the millions. Melanie Lynskey plays his wife and is like dumbbell nave Georgette (Georgia Engel) on the Mary Tyler Moore show. Whitacre lives in a fantasy world.
 There are some funny incidents, but for the most part, it is a theater of the ridiculous movie that just doesn't click and have the right style.",1271289600,,1559,4.853383458646617

STARRING: Matt Damon, Scott Bakula, Melanie Lynskey, Allan Havey, Joel McHale, Eddie Jemison, Scott Adsit and Tom Papa

WRITTEN BY: Scott Z. Burns; based on the book by Kurt Eichenwald

DIRECTED BY: Steven Soderbergh

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 18 September 2009

What makes The Informant! a great film, is the performance of Matt Damon. How he wasn't nominated here is beyond me. He put on 30 pounds for this, and some of the best comedians out there could not have played this part as funny as Damon does. He's absolutely hysterical.

His name is Mark Whitacre. He will remind you of countless people you have met in your life that have gotten under your skin. There are so many of them out there, that there's a chance a good portion of you reading this, could be among them! GOSSIPERS and or HABITUAL LIARS; people who live to spread rumors and lies and then sit back and watch how it all unravels. Why? I don't know why exactly, and I can't imagine being capable of doing it. But having seen the humorous effects it has in this film, you can at least appreciate the entertainment value it must reward these obscure individuals with.

The company Whitacre works for may or may night be involved in price fixing. He runs with a hunch to the FBI. Soon enough, they are interviewing him and he is ecstatic. He often makes comments on the comparisons his situation has to that of one in any given `Crichton novel.'

He has his wife involved, co-workers and friends are involved, and he seems to be telling each of them a slightly different version of the same story. The two FBI agents helping him are played perfectly by Scott Bakula and Joel McHale, and soon enough, they fall victim to his charades as well.

What started as a simple investigation into price fixing, spans over several years and turns into a multi-million dollar scandal. The FBI has Whitacre wearing a wire for several of those years, in which he humorously narrates everything that is happening for the annoyed agents. Matter of fact, he narrates the entire film for us, in a series of very well written tidbits of useless trivia and conspiracy theories. These were some of the film's highlights.

He also has a few attorneys take an interest in his case. At one point, immediately before walking into a prestigious meeting with some big-wigs, he tells the lawyers flat-out, ""Listen, I haven't been tellin' you guys the whole truth... but I'm gonna clear that up in there today."" They swallow their tongues in desperate shock; we swallow ours in fits of rolling laughter. The film is more than deserving of its obnoxious explanation point at the end of the title.",1270857600,,2661,4.6788008565310495
3760198,4,B001PR0YGC,"There is a big caveat to watching this movie and enjoying it, namely that you have to stick with it for at least thirty minutes or so to catch ahold of it and where it is going with the Matt Damon character.  Once you do that, it is nothing short of amazing most of the time. Damon is terrific in it and one would never suspect this is the same actor who plays Jason Bourne! He is a corporate nerd.  Make that super nerd.  He gets involved as an FBI informant for the crime of price fixing.  This is hardly the stuff of which riveting crime drama is made of as it is about white collar as you can get with your experts being accountants instead of pathologists.  You trace money to make a case, not bodies. If that was what the movie was about, it would be like watching paint dry.  What the movie is about is instead Matt Damon's character.  The FBI does not realize who it has picked as an informant or what he is capable of doing.  It only gradually begins to realize it and is horrified about the characteristics of its purported informant and witness. Damon never breaks character, which really makes the whole thing work.  If you feel like everything you have been watching is same old, same old, this is NOT!  I can't think of another movie like it.  I would push it up to 5 stars if it didn't take so long to get into it. Hang in there.

3760210,1,B001PR0YGC,"Intro: This is a review of the movie as an experience. Look elsewhere if you want an overview of the story, or how well the movie reflects actual events and people.

For those who would be satisfied with a movie that was simply a collection of goofy and absurdist scenes, I expect that the pacing here is much to slow to be satisfying, although in the second half it becomes noticeably less slow.

For those expecting more, the basic problem here is with how the lead character Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) is portrayed.  It is immediately reminiscent of the William H Macy character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/0792846427/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>: A doofus in over his head who is flailing about.  However, in Fargo there was a progression to that state--here it starts at that point and doesn't change much.

Even without the Fargo baggage, the Whitacre character is too big a goof to be sympathetic or funny.  My first impression was that he was an incompetent bottom level manager. When he was identified as a top manager, I couldn't help but think of him as a fraud, thereby undermining everything that was to come. In addition to his being a fraud within the movie, it was a fraud on the audience: Such a personality would never have gotten a PhD (from Cornell), much less risen so high in a major corporation (most people forced to work with such a person would be screaming and throwing things at him before the end of the first day).

The core of the movie's story is the revelation of a series of deceptions and lies.  The typical dramatic treatment, whether serious or humorous, is akin to a roller-coaster: It elevates your confidence that you know what is happening, then suddenly puts you into free fall, adding twists and turns to increase your disorientation. You start to climb out of that, only to be hit by additional drops.  This movie has no such drama: It just goes gently and slowly round and round, the tone being closer to enumerating the lies than to revealing them.  Perhaps Whitacre was intended to be played by an improvisational comic who was expected to fill in such texture?

As a movie, the significant story elements should have been _seen_ and not merely commented on by characters.  For example, Whitacre is presented as being maniac-depressive (bipolar), but we never _see_ that roller-coaster of emotions--the portrayal is very flat.  At the very end, statements of various characters provide some evidence of this (Nigerian scam, compulsive over-consumption).  Additionally, when part of the story is whether his underlying mental problems were triggered or exacerbated by his role as an informant, how could they not show this, but simply comment on it at the end?

The script has characters _saying_ that Whitacre is brilliant, but I remember only a couple of scenes where he _appeared_ even mildly clever.

We are _told_ that even after all the revelations of Whitacre's crimes and lying that some of the Feds (FBI and prosecutors) strongly advocated clemency for him, but from the movie, I couldn't guess why.  And during the extended investigation, there is no sense of the passage of time--other than dates being flashed on the screen. Nor do we _see_ the stresses on Whitacre: The script trivializes his risks and sacrifices by consigning them to asides in the disconnected goofy scenes that constitute this movie.

3760215,4,B001PR0YGC,"First off, this is not a documentary although it is based on real people and real events. It's also not one of those comedies where it is outrageously funny in the broad sense - no physical comedy, no ""I got to tell the people at work that joke"" kind of humor. But it's still funny.
I'd think it would take great courage to be a whistleblower. Most of us feel some sort of company loyalty plus the job does pay the bills. Plus would anybody ever hire you again to work for their company? Would that be seen as a good thing to have on your resume'? Or should you just leave that part off?
In this movie, you get to see what motivates one particular whitsleblower - Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), who worked for the very rich and powerful Fortune 500 company, Archer Daniels Midland. (Archer Daniels Midland is a huge agribusiness.)Mark Whitacre was the president of the bio-product division of ADM with a huge problem Whitacre has to solve - it appears the level of lysine is dying off in the ADM product and it could be infected with a virus. And than Whitacre gets an extortion attempt from another person in another company on how to keep the lysine healthy.
He reports this to his bosses, who promptly bring in the FBI (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale). They tap his home phones (one for personal, one for business) and things start to unravel from that point onwards.
Whitacre decides to ""come clean"" with the FBI and share the information that ADM conspired with other world wide manufacturers to control the price of lysine. Price fixing is a huge deal and has lots of penalties (financial as well as jail time) for the people who do this type of crime.
Whitacre is recruited (or does he recruit himself?) to be the inside person to document all the information. After all, he goes to the meetings, he has the company's trust and he has access to the players involved. He seems to relish his role as an FBI informant, seemingly wanting to be caught by his bosses.
For the FBI's part, they seem to be quite happy to have the possibility of this huge catch dangling in front of them. Whitacre's motives are not called into question until well into the investigation and that's by an agent that doesn't know him as well as the two agents who constantly work with Whiteacre.
What makes this interesting to me is that there are a lot of twists in the story. The movie viewer has the FBI's perspective as information about Whitacre is slowly dribbled out. There's no red herrings, no weird bits that throw you out of the movie and make you think ""how stupid were these people?"".
I really liked the movie. There are some complaints that the wife's perspective isn't given in the story. It appears the wife is peripheral to the movie and you never really know how much she knows at any point. To me, that makes it better as the story is solely concentrated on Whitacre and his actions. I recommend this movie highly for people who like their comsdy to make them think.",1268956800,2,2960,4.4935064935064934

Their purpose is to ""redistribute wealth"", from your wallet to their coffers, and not so freely to share-holders as to upper-level management. An alternative moral might be that the folk who manage mega-corporations are just as likely to be megalomaniacs and/or sociopaths as anybody else... as any elected politician, for instance... and just as likely NOT to be as smart as they think they are. Specifically, the tale told in the film ""The Informant"" exposes the arrogant greed and criminal indifference to the public of a very real, very large American corporation, Archer Daniels Midland, the giant of producers of corn products. The fate of one rather bizarre real-life character ... Mark Whitacre, played to the hilt by Matt Damon... should not completely distract the viewer from noting that ADM was proven guilty of price-fixing, illegal accounting practices, and other forms of ""gouging the public"", for which enormous fines were imposed and several executives sentenced to brief prison terms. Now, fining a corporation that is publicly ""owned"" by stockholders could be considered self-abuse, no better than an insidious form of taxation since you can be sure that the fine will be recouped from the public through the private industry form of taxation called ""higher prices"". So, however you write the script, it IS obvious that ADM and other mega-corporations consider themselves above the law, and operate accordingly whenever they can.

But meanwhile, back at the mansion... back at the ""entertainment"", that is ... this Mark Whitacre is a very weird dude. He's legendary as the ""highest ranking corporate whistle-blower"" in American business history. You can read about him on wikipedia. His real-life story is so well known that I can't consider telling it as ""spoiling"" the movie ending. In both real life and in this film, Whitacre cooperates with the FBI in gathering evidence of ADM's price-fixing, over the course of several years. Whitacre's motives are another matter, and that's where the film becomes ""art"" rather than documentary. In real life, ADM fights back, with the outcome that Whitacre's own fiscal malfeasance is revealed. Whitacre ends up ""in hot water"".

The film Whitacre is either unfathomably foolish or mentally imbalanced. Matt Damon plays him as the former slowly evolving toward the latter. At first the man seems strangely naive for someone in such a position. He describes himself as a scientist befuddled by the 'culture' of management. He certainly appears well-meaning, a sweet family man out of his depth among hard-headed bosses, a manatee swimming with sharks. Rugged Matt Damon deliberately gained some thirty pounds of suet for the role, and he walks/talks/stands like a podgy nerd. This sympathetic man of integrity, however, slowly lies himself into trouble. In fact, he can't control his mouth. Is he a pathological liar? Or is he so sure of his own charm and plausibility that he can't be bothered to distinguish between truth and lies? The film script raises the possibility that he suffers from a ""bipolar"" disorder, but that's utterly unconvincing, given Damon's portrayal. Damon's Whitacre shows none of the diagnostic signs of being bipolar. His affect and his actions would be more characteristic of a sociopathic personality disorder, for which pharmaceutical psychiatry has no effective treatment. In any case, he's not a guy to be trusted. Mild and disarmingly boyish as he is, he's actually a crook, as greedy and egocentric as any mobster but operating within the culture of corporate capitalism. It's not ethical standards that separate the ADM portrayed in this film from the usual Hollywood crime syndicate; it's the size of the operation. One might well ask whether ""Hollywood"" is presenting a fair picture of corporate America or a prejudicial distortion. In fact, one ought to ask that question, I think. But perhaps, as usual, I will be chided for trying to find something meaningful in a mere entertainment.

Damon's portrayal of Whitacre is the entertainment here, the whole point of ""The Informant"". The film is not as funny, in my opinion, as the promotion claims. It starts slowly; the first half-hour could fairly be called dull. Then, as Whitacre's 'identity' starts to tangle and snag like snarled fishing line, the story becomes perversely fascinating. You started by feeling anxiously protective of that fresh-faced babe-in-the-woods, and you slowly come to realize that you've been ""had"" by him, bamboozled, conned just as badly as the FBI agents who trusted him. By the end of the film, it's only his loyal, gullible wife who believes in him.

The real Mark Whitacre is the subject of ongoing controversy in the USA, with some people maintaining that he was a genuine hero who got a bad rap from the big bad government, while others regard him as another example of the corruption of wealth.

At first you might not recognize Damon. That's because he gained 30 pounds, added a mustache and hairpiece to transform himself into a ""nerdy"" biochemist and executive officer of a high-profile agricultural firm flourishing in the '90's.

The actor inside the character inside the character--or something like that--is so believable! Matt Damon plays this character close to the chest, revealing only throw-away cards at a time. It's a brilliant performance, but the viewer won't know it until the very end, suddenly to feel the need to hit the back button to see the film again--this time with great admiration for Damon's amazing, consummate, actorly skills. This is totally Matt Damon's show!

When I rented this DVD, I thought I was getting Damon's new action flick and was SO disappointed that the story was about conglomerate misdoings--price fixing. Although wrapped in a film of humor, the story transcends humor to reveal its serious underbelly--those horrible things we often affix to big business: corruption, sweet deals, pocket lining, disdain for loyalty and honesty. Anything for self-promotion and the mighty buck! Again, I've just used words that, out of context, provide no context for the real subject of ""The Informant."" Perhaps the title itself is a clue.

While the action may seem a bit slow, each new revelation will jolt the viewer out of any daze to start sitting up and paying attention. This is film work at its subtle best! Kudos go to Steven Soderbergh for his choice of story and direction in showing that story. Perhaps it's not Academy Award material, but it is one of those films you must see.

Matt Damon is brilliant and so are the rest of the cast choc-a-bloc with stand-up comedians. The voice over narration is a wonderful technique for letting us understand Whitacre's psyche better.

3760232,3,B001PR0YGC,"Steven Soderbergh's ""The Informant!"" is a film as baffling as the events upon which it is based on. You may or may not find the film itself very funny, which deals with some serious issues like corporate corruption and whistleblower. ""The Informant!"" follows the real-life story of Mark E. Whitacre, high-level executive-turned-FBI informant, which is literally stranger than fiction, but the way Soderbergh handles the subject matter is sometimes even stranger. Is this a drama or a comedy? If comedy, is it an off-beat comedy, a dark comedy or satire? A satire on what?

One thing is certain. Whatever your reaction may be, you cannot deny the brilliant performance from Matt Damon as Mark Whitacre, who had been acting as FBI informant during the three-year investigation into the price-fixing conspiracy. Things get bizarre when the FBI (and the company, too) come to know more about the activities of the whistleblower whose motive is elusive at best. Matt Damon perfectly becomes the person himself, and his quirky, stream-of-conscious-like voiceover tells us more about the character he plays than the complicated story, an informant who never stops supplying ""information.""

Steven Soderbergh's direction here is experimental. Oscar-wining director whose previous works include ""Oceans Eleven,"" ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" is also the director of ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and ""Schizopolis."" The original music by Marvin Hamlisch (which reminded me of Woody Allen's ""Bananas"", for which Marvin Hamlisch provided a score) sounds very unique, maybe too unique. While the events took place in the 1990s, Steven Soderbergh employs the 1970s-style visuals, which I think are pointless and detracting, so are the cameos (including Smothers Brothers).

Also, as the film (based on the book by Kurt Eichenwald) spends so much time on this unlikely hero, some questions are left unanswered. Melanie Lynskey plays Mark Whitacre's loving wife Ginger, but good as her performance is, her character remains uninteresting because we are not allowed to know one thing - how much does she know?

So, whether you enjoy watching the film and its unbelievable based-on-truth story depends on your taste. Personally, considering the source material that is unique, I think the film would have been better with a more straightforward narrative.",1266364800,9,2336,5.40934065934066
3760233,3,B001PR0YGC,"Having grown up just a few miles from where the events of THE INFORMANT! took place (though I was just a kid at the time), I may be rather partial to the film; after all, Matt Damon and much of the supporting cast has the personality down pat, with a few aside-jokes that definitely capture the atmosphere of East-Central Illinois.  But you don't have to be from here to appreciate the film's humor; you just have to be patient.

Why?  Because THE INFORMANT is a slow burner.  It's the story of Mark Whitacre, who decides to blow the lid on some illegal doings at the corn-processing plant where he works.  Whitacre, however, is anything but the ideal witness--but it takes about two-thirds of the movie to find that out.  Kudus to Joel McHale and Scott Bakula as the FBI agents in charge of Whitacre's case, and Soderbergh for actually making a movie of this; and a tip-of-the-hat to Matt Damon, who turns in a nuanced performance.  But the character doesn't really build until the third act, which is the when the movie turns from humor to poignancy, and we realize the real tale here.

The thing is, it's just hard to forgive THE INFORMANT its slow build-up.  Real hard.  It's worth the effort; a lot of the humor is subtle, and the film progressively gets darker, until you realize this isn't a feel-good comedy after all.  But it takes so long getting there, a large part of the audience is bound to stop caring.  Thus, THE INFORMANT! is for patient fans of comedy (of which there are painfully few today).  If nothing else, see it for Damon's spot-on performance; he and Bakula especially are taking this film and running with it, for better or worse (mainly better).",1266364800,27,1673,4.592592592592593

The film tells the story of an insider working for a very large corporation who finds himself involved in illegal activities and is faced with a moral dilema - go along with it and make a lot of money, or blow the whistle and take the moral high ground. There is also a question of his personal motivation to blow the whistle - is it completely moralistic or is it coupled with personal ambition and the desire to be a hero?

3760236,4,B001PR0YGC,"In 1992 Mark Whitacre, the President of Bio-Product division of ADM (powerful Fortune 500 company), became the highest ranking executive EVER to turn whistle blower. For three years he helped the FBI gather evidence of a multinational conspiracy to control the price of lysine. As a result, US government collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from ADM and foreign corporations, followed by prison sentences for three executives. These are events in real life as well as the movie. However, according to the opening credits, the film is not intended as a documentary and does depart from real life facts... The final, cheeky line of the prologue: ""So there!"", gives us a hint that, though the topic and the consequences suffered by many in this story are somber, what we are about to see is meant to amuse and entertain, as well as educate...

As promised, the chuckles do come often, but their source is not your typical one liners. Matt Damon is Whitacre, an inspired choice for the role. His plump, mustachioed and toupeed character comes across so harmless and ordinary you never question why his actions go undetected; even as his concealed recording equipment loudly malfunctions during a covert multinational executive meeting! You laugh at the bewilderment of FBI agents and the DA's office as they are led by the nose by Whitacre's increasingly outlandish antics. One could say ""The Informant!"" has the educational quality of an Aesop's fable: blinded by their desire to swallow a tasty morsel (ADM), the agents cross their fingers and fail to run even the most basic checks on their informant; checks that would immediately reveal inconsistencies in his stories (such as the true nature of his parentage, for example).

The film is not perfect. Based on the way it was being advertised, I expected something in the same category as ""The Pink Panther"". In reality, one would not be wrong to describe it as a combination of ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Insider"", and ""The Duck Soup"" (Marx Brothers). Sadly, ""The Informant!"" never quite becomes as touching, thrilling and funny as those films were, respectively. The makers allow it to drag on a bit in the second half as Whitacre's behaviour becomes absurd. The logical explanation for it all arrives only after our initial keen interest has already begun to dissipate. I also hear some grumblings about the film's muted lighting. Since most of the action takes place in offices and hotels, I believe the lighting is true to reality. Anyone who has spent at least one work day in a cubicle, understands how oppressive that atmosphere can be. Despite these possible faults, Whitacre's story and Damon's performance make ""The Informant!"" worthy of at least one theater trip. Depending on your personal approach, you will see a funny thriller or... a thrilling comedy. Either way, expect to be entertained!

ADM fast-tracker Whitacre (Damon) works in the lysine developing section of ADM and is a bipolar, pathological liar.  Leading a stuffy duplicitous life required of a top executive bringing down his own company, Whitacre exposes an international price-fixing scam by working closely with the FBI over the course of three years, during which time his lies destroy the investigation and his life.

Stylistically it's a pleasant look back twenty years or so, almost like watching an extended cut of Mad Men...except not as biting.  The most entertaining aspect of this film is Mark Hamlisch's score.  Quirky and upbeat, it supplies contextual support like choppy violin strokes during a tip-toeing Tom and Jerry scene.  Oblivious to the world around him, Whitacre could very well hear the pseudo-Muzak elevator music that oftentimes accompanies his irrelevant, schizophrenic non sequiturs - the only entertaining aspect of the film.
