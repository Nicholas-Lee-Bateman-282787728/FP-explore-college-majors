3544048,5,B001DZOCVO,"I had been waiting a long time to get the first season of According to Jim. I can't understand why there are other shows that are not so good but come out sooner. This one (and Just Shoot Me!) had taken a long time.

If you saw the show you know what it is all about. The Special Features are good, specially the part where Jim tells us the inside about the show, the characters and even the set up and mementos by the fridge that remind everyone one the set about their families and loved ones.

My only regret is that I finished watching the whole season already and there isn't even a date for the second season or a way to subscribe -like they always have here at Amazon- to be notified when it will come out.

Don't miss it. It's funny! Jim and his brother in law make a great pair. I like the fact that unlike other family sitcoms, Jim does wrong most of the time but you don't actually blame him but empathize with him because he is a regular guy not pretending to be ""perfect... husband or father"" but instead, the everyday family man that makes mistakes and has fun ... messing things up. I LOVE IT!",1229817600,15,1108,4.192488262910798
3544049,4,B001DZOCVO,"I don't know why a lot of people want According to Jim off the air. It is very funny even if Jim is a lieing jerk who's a bad example for his kids. Still, I'm not sure why the fact that James Belushi has a show gets picked on by shows like the Simpsons. Homer had a fit in one episode because the show was still on the air. Belushi is funny and does a good job in the show.

  However, it's the supporting cast that mostly keeps me watching. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is super cute as Jim's sister in-law Dana and one of the reasons I even got into the show. I did like her more when she was single though lol. While Larry Joe Campbell gets lots of laughs as Jim's best friend and brother in-law Andy. Courtney Thorne-Smith does under-rated work as Jim's wife Cheryl as well. The kids are cute too.

  The show is funny but it's very different than the ABC TGIF shows that I grew up with and Home Improvement as well. That doesn't mean that I wish it had mushy and cutsie aww moments like Full House and Family Matters though. But no way should it out live Home Improvement though, which was a much more fun show to watch. According to Jim is a sleazy but funny show and is certainly better than the recent comedies it out lasted on ABC. I'd watch it over the Caveman show any day, but then again who wouldn't.",1225756800,2,1310,4.178571428571429
3544050,5,B001DZOCVO,I recently got into according to jim on a regular basis.  When the show started I was in college and was rarely around to see the show.  I love how hystarically funny Jim is and I would love to have cheryls roll.  I have always loved the Belushi Brothers and this show is doing the same for Jim as Blues Brothers did for John.  I also love that Dan Ackroyd is a recurring guest star.  I love the fact that I can watch this with my boyfriend and we both love it.  I especially like it when I can poke fun at him for trying to get away with the schemes that Jim trys to pull on Cheryl,1224028800,,582,3.889830508474576
3544051,5,B001DZOCVO,"I, like the previous two reviewers, have anxiously awaited the offering of year sets for this hilarious sitcom.  And, we don't have to buy 1/2 year productions like ""Three Sons"".  James Belushi is great!  Sure, some episodes are very melodramatic like most sitcoms, but many story-lines are easy to envision happening in our own lives.  I rate this as good as ""2 1/2 Men"".  Hopefully Season 2 is not long off. I suggest you purchase this series, something I rarely do.",1222732800,,468,4.728395061728395

3544085,5,B001DZOCVO,This one is a matter of opinion.  I personally do not care for it due to the content of the father.  Teaches younger age groups that their parents can use their children and show very little caring and love.  Would not purchase but my husband likes it.,1389484800,,252,4.319148936170213
3544086,3,B001DZOCVO,"""According to Jim"" is one of my all-time favourite sitcoms and it stills holds up after 10 years. Can't stop laughing!

However, when I started watching the Season 1 set, I noticed something really strange. There are at least half a dozen episodes listed on the inside cover that are missing on all 4 discs. I've tried to see if they're included on the special features or elsewhere but no luck. There are no discs missing, just missing episodes. I'm returning it and Season 2 (defective disc 1) for replacement.",1388448000,3,512,4.688888888888889

3544097,5,B001DZOCVO,"we thoroughly ENJOYED this 1st season. when the show first started, did not watch any of it due to work commitments and our own family' craziness lol. the writing is superb and the whole cast is EXCELLENT. the chemistry of 'jim' and 'cheryl' is spot-on.  the show's other family's nucleus, 'dana', 'andy', 'ruby', 'gracie', and even baby 'kyle' -each has their own moments. they're funny. we all LOVE 'andy' - he is so hilarious ... especially when he is around the 'ruby' and 'gracie' especially 'gracie'. i like the way, j belushi potrays jim.  a loving dad and husband, but what a HE-MAN ... but, so 'absent with malice' .... he, obviously ADORE his family, love his sister-in-law and brother-in-law, yet being himself - all HE-MAN-LIKE but with a HEART!. can't wait for the season two dvd! a must buy!",1271548800,7,805,4.742857142857143

3544114,5,B001DZOCVO,"So, since I'm from Luxembourg and have the opportunity to see this on German TV, it is the synchrone version. They have german voices. Well, I know Jim's real voice from movies, which I see in original version in Luxembourgish cinemas. Well, in Luxembourg we kind of are polyglotte.....
So to see this TV series in original, I bought it through AMAZON in the U.S.
I adored this. It's even more refreshing than in German. Apart of Andy (arggggghhhhhhhhh) always showing his fat belly to everyone, my favourite caracters are Jim and Dana and the two girls. So keep going James Belushi! And please, the next seasons quicker on DVD!!!!!!!!
And last but not least: all fans of Belushi, buy his audio book: Real men don't apologize. THIS is something to laugh out loud an sometimes also get a little moist eyes too.

The first season is imho one of the best.

With some very funny outtakes. Also don't miss the other bonus tracks ""behind the scenes"" and ""comedy begins at home""

One thing: The paper package lets it look a little cheap.
But who cares.",1236124800,,285,4.461538461538462
3544117,5,B001DZOCVO,This was a gift for my son for Christmas.  He absolutely loves this show - so do I.  It's great that it is finally on dvd.  Maybe blu-ray for the next season - and more than one season at a time??  Thanks!,1233187200,,205,3.8095238095238093

I always liked but never really laughed.
As i was watching the dvds as i always kinda tempted to watch something else and give it a chance.
