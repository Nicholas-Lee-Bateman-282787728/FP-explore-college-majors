I confess that I am just now discovering Sterling Hayden ""the man"" but have long admired his work as an actor.  As I read his fine novel Wanderer and learn more about him, I was surprised to discover this documentary existed.  I hesitated briefly at paying $39.00 for a documentary about which so little had been written.  It is worth every penny!  Riveting--- an unvarnished multi-day personal visit with Sterling Hayden.  Yes he's drunk, yes he's high, but a more honest, intimate portrait of a complex human being you will not find.  It's like traveling back in time.  Watching Pharos of Chaos, I kept being reminded of the question ""What if you could invite 5 famous people to a dinner party...""  I would certainly include Sterling Hayden.  After viewing the film, I was surprised to discover New York Times Film Critic Janet Maslin's stunted 1983 review of this documentary.  Perhaps times and tastes change, but in her unflattering review, Ms. Maslin laments the lack of active direction from the film crew; the documentary is apparently not sufficiently ""choreographed"" to suit her.  I disagree.  There are many wonderful elements at work here.  A man who spent his life on the open sea being reduced to living on a river barge nestled between very tall ancient city walls, the ""throne"" Sterling sits on while he reads passages from Stevenson's ""An Inland Voyage"", and my favorite...  a long-shot of Hayden standing erect, paddling the small barge tender across the canal in the early morning.  Years of serious alcoholism and drug abuse unable to diminish his 6'-5"" frame.  I could go on...  It's not pretty, but it is real.  It is not so often you have the chance to witness a man face his demons, his regrets, his opportunities missed...Careful, you might just recognize a few of your own.  Well Done Indeed.

8646904,5,B00IZQQDKC,brutal. depressing. but how many actors would ever expose themselves to  that type of honesty? not a pretty picture but well-worth the 2 hours plus do watch the director's interview.,1408924800,5,182,5.066666666666666
