2486580,5,B000E3K32S,"If you can find the two-disc special edition from HK, that is your best bet.

Let me start out by saying that I really didn't know what to expect going in to this one. I had heard it mentioned quite a bit whenever someone brought up director Johnnie To. But I wasn't familiar with the story or even the style of the film. My To experience is usually equated to ""Exiled"" or ""The Mission"", a little more action-based.

But ""Election"" turned out to be a fantastic gangster drama. For most of us fans of Asian films, triads tend to be stock bad guys that rogue cops and kung fu vigilantes hunt down to exact their revenge. I enjoyed this because it gave a real perspective and depth to a group of characters we've seen hundreds of times, but never really gotten to know.

Like the ""Godfather"" saga (1 and 2) it's not just about guns and illegal activities. It's about family, leadership, tradition, personalities, conflicts, and so much more. The story is basically about the bi-annual triad chairman election and the two top candidates and their power-plays to get the top spot. It's the nice, level-headed conservative candidate vs. the rock star.

What I loved about this film is the way it played out like a chess game. You sit back eagerly waiting to see what the player's next move will be. And it's all captured with that fantastic Johnnie To style. Very smooth and dynamic, with an excellent, inconspicuous musical score.

The story is one set of twists and turns after another. Sometimes you see what's coming and sometimes you don't. Fans of movies like ""Infernal Affairs"" should really enjoy this. But it is not an action flick. If you're looking for kung fu or guns, not here. You'll be doing some heavy reading at times on the subtitles, but it's worth it.

The story feels a little unfinished. . .because it is. Part 2 picks up exactly where you want it to, and it's based around the characters you want it to be. Checking out both is a must.

Bottom line, anyone who's into crime dramas or gangster films should definitely enjoy this one. It's not as over-the-top as ""Scarface"" or as epic as ""The Godfather"". But ""Election"" can certainly hold its own with the best of them.",1217894400,,2184,4.584615384615384
2486581,5,B000E3K32S,"I find these movies (this one and even more so the sequal) to be worth several times through.  The thing is that the drama creates just the right tension, and then that is is resolved through action.  The action is great, and it fits an overall scheme and an interesting story.",1211587200,,277,4.411764705882353
2486582,3,B000E3K32S,"If you're looking for action here, you'll be disappointed. There are some killing scenes but they do not contain big explosions or kung fu fighting. If you like character development, psychology, betrayal and twisted plots, you'll like this movie.

It's worth watching.",1199145600,,269,5.404761904761905
2486583,5,B000E3K32S,"Election is the first film in this gangster series (Triad Election is the sequel) from the greatest filmmaker currently working in Hong Kong, Johnnie To. If you aren't familiar with Mr. To's work, imagine John Woo with less action (at least in this film - watch Exiled, another top notch film, for more action oriented To fare) but a much better handle on story and storytelling than Woo ever had. This is less action/thrills oriented than Infernal Affairs (which it is sometimes compared to), but I think Election is a much better film.

The simple synopsis - two mob bosses, one all business and one all bluster, compete for leadership of their gang. When the election doesn't go the way some want, all hell breaks loose, threatening the stability of the already teetering Hong Kong underworld.

Tony Leung Ka Fai won the acting award for his Nicholson-esqe over-the-top performance as the loud mouth, obnoxious mob boss, but it is Simon Yam that really shines in his role - the transformation of his character over the course of this film is a 2-hour acting lesson that totally blew me away.

The U.S. DVD has all the special features that were on the Hong Kong 2-Disc Special Edition, but at a nicer price, and the transfer is excellent. I can't recommend this film enough, and the Tartan DVD is the way to go.

Attention Canadians - the Canadian release (not from Tartan) is bare-bones, this is the one to get if you are interested in special features!",1197504000,17,1457,4.701960784313726
2486584,3,B000E3K32S,"ELECTION (Hak Se Wui, 1995) starring Simon Yam (reprising his role as
a triad godfather as seen in CASINO 1997 by Billy Tang, for ex) is a
movie intended for fans of this genre, underlying the testosterone,
discipline and ancient traditions aspects of masculinity.

Either the script's writer had a bad nightmare on which this movie
was constructed, or the writer simply decided to show a very limited,
narrow range of what comprises humanity, and understanding the latter
either poorly, or not heving been exposed to very much of it, in
reality.

The aforementioned aspects seems to eat away at the classy aspects
that a picture craves, this film suffering  also from the homicidal
behavior that the movie shows at the 90 min mark.

The strong point of this picture, is a story centering on the
election of a triad successor, which the audience will recognize as
similar to modern politics. Any strategy is good, to get to the top
...payoffs to electors preparing to cast their votes to win their
favor, maneuvering, violence, kidnappings, brutality, financial
enticements all the while, with a law enforcement presence that
delays, complicates and hinders the entire underground electoral
process.

Key street-level bosses are called in a meeting, to vote for one
candidate or another, raising their hand to signal their approval.
Interestingly, the defeated candidates don't abandon victory so soon
or easily, fully conscious that it's fully possible to gain the upper
hand and coerce opponents with some effort and skill, from their
genetic make-ups as triad leaders having climbed to the top, to the
point of being candidates for the top dog position.

The film is no-nonsense, preferring to show only professional
dealings vs. a wide spectrum of emotions, such as humor, sex,
drinking, amusement or other lighter sides of things, which is
unrealistic, in terms of accepting the proposition overall in terms
of both private and public lives that make up these trial people.

An aspect underlined is loyalty, an oath taken by soldiers in the
triad, to the point that, a member is made to break his porcelain
spoon, crack it and eat it on the orders of his boss, without
questioning, much as military soldiers are trained to do, in a
pavlovian reaction. Other instances show the ruthlessness and
willingness to die openly admitted by members, in favor of their
gang, their minds stamped with the triad's codified rules of conduct,
as a brotherhood, with and loyalty standing above everything else.

Cash generating activities are referenced, such as drugs, gambling,
black market reselling of tainted chickens and commodities, etc.

The filming is very good, with a pleasing high-quality widescreen,
showing Hong Kong, mostly in closed meetings, versus open air,
outdoor locations, from which the movie somewhat suffers, coupled
with a decision to  create suspense and  tension over 1 hour over the
pursuit of a dragon baton symbol.

A sarcastic criticism of the law, is made, when a top law officer is
presented, and openly admits having reached the top of the echelon by
having agreed early in his career to infiltrate a gang, betray their
trust, later busting them with incriminating evidence, suggesting
dishonorable conduct among that law officers, and that they, the
triad members, are the true honorable men, self-righteous as they
are.

The difficulty in controlling 50,000 to 300,000 men, all belonging to
underground triad organizations is understood by these, which limits
the range of crackdowns they can carry out.

A clear decision was made to limit action scenes in the movie, and to
limit the presence of guns and bullets almost entirely, which eats
away at the entertainment aspects of the movie, too.

Overall, in addition to the above aspects, ELECTION will interest
those viewers who tend to believe there is more than what meets in
the eye, in terms of cash flows, businesses, commerce, and political
icons in the modern world.

There are behaviors occurring behind the scenes, secret
organizations, not unlike Freemasonry for example. Also those who are
at the top, much like the boss in any corporation, only with much
difficulty will relinquish his position. More likely, they are
ever-vigilant of any new competitor arriving to whom the godfather
position in the triad, consciously, or unconsciously, appeals to
them, and will take them out if needed, promptly.",1191801600,,4389,5.126050420168068
2486585,4,B000E3K32S,"""Election"" directed by Johnnie To, is an engaging action thriller that manages to entertain the spectator, but that might scare some people due to numerous scenes of violence.

The two main characters are Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung), the two main candidates to become the new chairman of one of Hong Kong's most importants triads, the Wo Shing Society. The senior members of the The Wo Shing Society have the power to choose the next president, and will do so in a triad-run election. But how far is each of these candidates willing to go in order to have absolute power? And where do tradition, loyalty and duty stand in modern times?

These questions, and some more, will be answered if you give ""Election"" a chance. This is the first movie I watch by this Hong Kong director, and I liked it well enough to know I will try to find out more about his work. From my point of view, this film is not perfect (3.5 stars out of 5), but it original, and well-worth seeing, if you can stand the sometimes shocking violence. If that is the case, recommended...

2486586,5,B000E3K32S,"Election, winner of the 2005 HK film awards is a nice touch of triad lifestyle and politics.  Beating Infernal Affairs II for BEST picture.  Johnnie To's does it again and his work is close to Michael Mann's ""Heat"".  The cinematography is good.  Story was well written.  Cast was great!  I was surpise in how HK will follow up Infernal Affairs after it took the 2004 awards.  This collector's edition disc set is a great value and footage of teh Cannes festival was intersting.  I hope that America dos not make another Asain remake again.",1177632000,,539,4.659574468085107
2486587,3,B000E3K32S,"Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue, but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions (though not the violence) in favor of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. It's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander.

Extras on the 2-disc set aren't over-plentiful, but the interviews with Johnnie To, Simon Yam (always at his best under To's direction, and possibly never better here), Wang Tianlin and Tony Leung Ka Fei are more in-depth and thoughtful than usual. Also included are a brief featurette (like the interviews subtitled in English), stills galleries, 2 unsubtitled TV spots, 2 unsubtitled theatrical trailers, and booklet.",1161388800,3,1233,5.2272727272727275

Very pleasant surprise for me was seeing David Chiang outside of the old Shaw brother movies I am trying to collect. Will have to check 'Hong Kong Cinemagic' to see what else I might have missed.

I am not sure why so many people seemed to enjoy this film.

I would recommend Triangle instead, in which To directed the last third of which is very entertaining.",1313280000,2,394,3.925
8105311,4,B000E3K32S,"The Wo Shing triad is the oldest and most powerful gang in Hong Kong; they are also unique in their time-honored tradition of holding democratic elections among the various leaders for the big boss or chairman of the triad. This time around, succession will not happen without a fight.  The two leading candidates have very different approaches to leadership, and neither can effectively lead while the other retains his strength.  While ""Big D"" craves power for its own sake, ""Lok"" is a shrewd businessman and devoted father who sees crime as a means to an end and values stability, peace and tradition.  When it comes time for a new leader, and ""Big D"" refuses to accept defeat, it looks like civil war within the triad is imminent.

Hong Kong director Johnnie To can do violence.  While I tend to prefer the stylistic flourishes of another major Hong Kong director, Wong Kar-Wai, there's no denying that Johnnie To's approach has a broader appeal, but doesn't dumb things down in the Hollywood blockbuster style.  What is remarkable in this film is the restraint and the emphasis on the difficult choices that a leader, even a criminal leader, must make.  There is no gun play, which is not to say that there is no brutal violence, but much of the action involves conversation.  In the world depicted here it's not brutality but intelligence that prevail - though part of what the film shows is that a leader in this world has to be prepared to get his hands dirty.  Since it is about the succession of power and the meaning of honor among organized criminals, ""Election"" deserves to be compared to Coppola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B0018CMJSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>&nbsp;(though a more apt comparison may be with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoodFellas/dp/0790729725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoodFellas</a>).  While they are very different films, both in tone and context and cultural background, they are both very effective in conveying the weight of tradition as it comes into conflict with greed and ambition.  Both also focus on the moral impact on a leader of the means necessary to consolidate power.  Finally, both are shot in a distinctive and effective style, and put the importance on character over chaotic action, but don't shy from conveying the brutality of mob violence.  When violence does erupt in this film, it's not stylized and it's not pretty.  Unlike a good deal of Hong Kong film, the criminals are not glamorized here, though neither is the law.  It all comes to a devastating and powerful climax (about which I'll say nothing to avoid spoilers), where it is the subtle touches (the frightened monkeys, for example, and the son's looks) that add weight and poignancy together a violent episode.

Highly recommended for lovers of inventive Asian cinema and for its fresh take on the gangster film.",1249430400,3,2963,5.353448275862069
8105312,4,B000E3K32S,"Man...this one gave me goose bumps. The story alone was enough to rattle my cage. But the most haunting element of this crime drama is the mood. There's a silence that underscores the entire film that put me in the mind of Michael Mann's ""Heat."" The edges of these hard characters is palpable. There's a memorable scene where a character Lok takes a porcelain spoon, breaks it, grinds it up and eats it. There's no ambient background music to go with it. Just his cold eyes and the crunch of porcelain against teeth. Lawd that scene kinda shook me up. Definitely a film I'd recommend.
