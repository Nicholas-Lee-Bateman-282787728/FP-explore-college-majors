8489893,5,B005ZOPANI,AWESOME.Absolutely necessary for any Fate fan. Flawless,1500508800,,55,7.0
8489894,5,B005ZOPANI,Is this dvd box set in English dubbed?,1418428800,,38,3.875
8489895,5,B005ZOPANI,"This is an import special edition from japan. This is what the Japanese pay for ANY anime. I'm glad to spend the money on a high quality release rather than have a 50 cheap box with terrible subs. If you don't like the price, don't buy it, and don't make a review if you didn't.
I'm a hardcore collector, with money for high quality releases and extras, and I WANT the extras. This is exactly what I wanted and what I payed for, and just because you can't afford anything off of Funimation's SAVE line don't trash the product.
At least you don't live in Japan, where a single 2-4 episode volume is 60$ or up.",1394236800,2,608,4.25
8489896,1,B005ZOPANI,"ok first of $416 dollars thats just crazy for only 13 episodes it would make a bit more sense if it was the complete series but its not. and also the audio is all in Japaneses and no English this box is not worth it at all, yes it has subtitles but still that kinda disturbs some people from actually watching the anime. do not buy!! what a joke!",1340668800,8,346,4.028985507246377
8489897,5,B005ZOPANI,"Well first off this show is amazing! While I liked Fate/Stay Night and thought it was interesting there were some noticeable problems with the show; I wasn't really expecting much from this show, but it completely blew me away! The animation in this show is gorgeous and the writing is much tighter in this improving on the things the first show did right and getting rid of the things it didn't. Really you won't feel embarrassed having this show in your collection.

Now as for the price issue this is a Japanese limited edition set (i.e., an import) so yes it is expensive, and as such, it is only for people who are either huge mega fans of the series and/or serious collectors (of which I am both). Personally I have never been happier with a product and think it was worth every penny I spent (I order it from rightstuf.com which has it cheaper). I even pre-ordered the second box set as soon as it was announced, and I'm counting down the days until I can hold it in my hands.

Also there have been some people comparing this release to the Garden of Sinners set that came out (also a Japanese limited edition import) but Aniplex just announced a regular North American release for it, and I'm sure they will eventually do the same for Fate/Zero (heck it may even get a dub) so if you don't want to pay the high prince for these collector sets then wait for the regular release (i.e., the set for the more casual fans/collectors).  Yeah Aniplex's releases are a little more expensive, but they are quality releases; even the sound and picture quality of the DVDs is a noticeable step up from other companies, so I have found they are worth the little extra money.",1339459200,12,1670,4.4868421052631575
8489898,2,B005ZOPANI,"After watching the first season, I knew I immediately had to own it! I remember Aniplex having released a boxset of the first season some months ago, so I decided to check on RightStuff to order it.

...The moment I saw the price tag I think I wanted to hurl. $400 for thirteen episodes, some booklets, and 2 soundtracks? Are you freaking kidding me, Aniplex? These companies talk about how you should buy official products in order to support the industry, and yet they have the audacity to pull crap like this? If it were $100-$200, yeah, I'd probably purchase it. But $400? Why, Aniplex? Why? I'm sure this has something to do with the Japanese company, but like... really? $400 is part of my monthly rent! The price tag doesn't make sense. I remember reading that they are affiliated with Sony? Thaaat's probably why.

Yes, the show has some amazing quality animation, the voices are great, the soundtrack is great, but I unfortunately don't think the price is justified. If it were the entire series, then yes, I would probably cough up the money for it. But even then it should be less than $400 for 26 episodes. This is only 13.

This is why pirates pirate. I guess I will just enjoy my re-runs on crunchyroll until their streaming license expires. What a shame.",1334620800,25,1269,4.606194690265487
8489899,4,B005ZOPANI,"I write this review because I want to defense a little for Fate/Zero. I am one of those crazy ones who, being fortunate enough to squeeze out 350+ dollars from my pocket, bought this box set. (I purchased it on amazon jp because they offer a cheaper price, even after shipping).
I think Odin Babajic ""NudePicard"" has a point: this is not Japan, but Aniplex still refuses to localize it PLUS selling it at a Japan price. So, you may ask the question, ""why did you still buy it?""
My answer is that I really REALLY appreciate the efforts of staffs from ufotable made in the animation. The performance of seiyuu (I want to specifically mention Rider--Akio Ohtsuka), visualization, the use of light, color, special effects, and music was extraordinary (and this is also part of why this box set is so expensive--the budget of each episode was extremely high). I think the staff really kept their promise that they would set this series to a movie-standard for every single episode. The staff had been working non-stop even during December to March just to prepare for the second seasion (comment from seiyuus in the talk sessions). The passion from ufotable for Fate/Zero had a great impact on me. And to show my respect, I decided to pay for the box set. I know I am an idiot, but I do NOT regret about buying it.
However, even though I was happy with the purchase (which btw, also means that I am not going to spend anymore money for a LONG time), I still think it is very expensive, so I only give the product 4 stars.
It is completely predictable that people will use ""other methods"" to own this series, but, well, if someone happen to do so, keep it low.
And for a side note information, the Drama CD included in the box set is a short story about how Kiritsugu and Irisviel met and fell in love with each other...it was a pretty touching story to me, especially when you already know what is going to happen at the end.",1332201600,14,1920,4.457386363636363
8489900,1,B005ZOPANI,"I really don't need to spend a whole lot here.

1-It's only 13 episodes.  Only HALF of the complete series.
2-It's $370.
3-It's sub-only.
4-It's $370.
5-It's a DIRECT import from Japan.  In short...Aniplex of America didn't really even BOTHER with any sort of localization effort.  The only thing different is...a booklet that's a couple of pages?
6-It's $370.  In case that didn't sink in...this series will cost you SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS TO OWN.

Apparently, Aniplex of America thinks its fans are stricken with down syndrome to ACTUALLY expect us to pay for this.  That, or their marketing heads have a questionable IQ.  This is nothing short of a complete and total cockblock for fans who have been eagerly anticipating in owning this series, and a total lack of respect towards the struggling anime industry itself.  It's practically INVITING piracy to run rampant, and in this one case, I FULLY support that very piracy.  By all means, download and share the links.  Perhaps if they aren't complete muppets, they just might, JUST MIGHT, get the hint that THEY'RE DOING IT WRONG.

Now.  This argument has been made before.  I'm fully aware of what the naysayers will retort with:

ARGUMENT: This is a premium from Japan!
RETORT: ""Premium from Japan"" simply means an import without any sort of localization effort.  They've done nothing more than take the product from Japan, and slap on an American UPC code sticker.  They're trying to get as much money as possible from as little work as possible.

ARGUMENT: All anime costs this much in Japan!
RETORT: This argument has two major flaws:  1-This isn't Japan.  2-Lol no, they do not.  The high price tags (especially from Aniplex) are nothing more than MSRP.  Let's take the Garden of Sinners blu-ray set as an example.  Its MSRP was about $700, yet roughly after a week, quite a few shops in Akihabara began selling it for as low as a lil over a $100 (high, but still at least a MARGINALLY reasonable price).  Stateside, we have a bit of a pickle.  Whereas any registered media chain in Japan was eligible of selling it (and thus, fluctuating the price accordingly), Aniplex is placed something of a monopoly in America - they ONLY offer their products on Right Stuf International.  And ONLY at their choice prices.  (This listing on Amazon is nothing more than an offshoot).  And when you actually even go on RightStuf and try to order this item, you'll notice that it isn't eligible for coupon discounts, for affiliate discounts, or membership discounts.  They have gone an extra mile to make sure you can't even ATTEMPT to even somewhat lessen the pricetag unless you live in Japan.  Is that ""premium pricing?""  No.  It's sheer tomfoolery, and nothing more.

ARGUMENT: Fans complain that anime takes too long to come out!
RETORT: Yes.  But I'm 100% certain that those same fans will agree that paying $370 for half a show is downright moronic.  I'm sure that once they see what it means to get a show here faster, they'll accept the compromises that come with proper localization.  That is, of course, referring to SANE fans.  People who don't toss away their mortgage payments on entertainment that lasts for only a couple of hours.

As a FAN of Fate/Zero, and someone who FULLY SUPPORTS the anime industry, I urge you:  Do not buy this.  Download.  Pirate it instead.  Tell Aniplex about it.  The more people buy this, the more Aniplex will realize that they can get away with this.  And THAT results in more fans getting screwed over things they've been looking forward to.",1331510400,27,3545,4.788429752066116
