7004459,1,B00TCXZIOY,"I wouldn't spend that dreadful collection by the worst Tom and Jerry producer who once told his friends that he has a personal dislike for Tom and Jerry.  Gene Deitch is easily the worst producer who nearly brought Tom and Jerry down to the worst levels.  His shorts are hastily produced as a result of cheap labor.  DON'T waste your time on this awful collection.  Trust me, I know.",1433376000,7,383,4.507246376811594

Plus, a lot can argue over which post Hanna-Barbera Tom and Jerry era was better. But if there are people (like me) who do enjoy Gene Deitch's shorts (or his work for that matter) or looking to finally complete their theatrical Tom and Jerry collection, then you've come to the right place. You get all 13 shorts all of which will be remastered and 2 featurettes; Tom and Jerry...and Gene: The Rembrandt Years and Much Ado About Tom and Jerry (the latter ported over from the 70th anniversary compilation set).

7004471,5,B00TCXZIOY,"As a T&J classic cartoon completist, I love this set. Sure, Gene Deitch may not have done the best job with these shorts, but I think he deserves some slack. After all, as others have said, he had never seen HB's T&J and had to improvise on his own with the cat-and-mouse duo. Although not exactly my favorite, they're still pretty decent.

On that basis, I'm grading the 5 stars to the DVD release itself. The shorts look great, having been remastered (as opposed to the awful TV prints released in the UK in 2005 that have also aired on Cartoon Network) and are presented in their original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 unlike the Chuck Jones set which was cropped to widescreen (1.78:1).

Well done, WB. Too bad the Hanna-Barbera Golden Collection sets had to be cancelled.",1458518400,,769,4.605839416058394

7004475,5,B00TCXZIOY,"The Gene Deitch era of Tom and Jerry has always been my favorite era ever since I was a child.  So sad that only 13 were produced.

7004476,5,B00TCXZIOY,"These were my favorite Tom & Jerry cartoons when I was younger mainly because they were so bizarre. I've purchased the other Tom & Jerry collections ( I loved all the their shows through the Chuck Jones era) but this is the one I've been waiting for. If you were into the Gene Deitch era...this is it!!! On another note, I was very pleased with the punctuality of the seller; my package arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I'd highly recommend both the DVD collection and the seller.",1439769600,,491,4.590909090909091
7004477,5,B00TCXZIOY,I've been waiting for this collection for a long time as it completes the DVD release of the Tom & Jerry theatrical shorts.,1437523200,2,123,4.391304347826087
7004478,5,B00TCXZIOY,"There's going to be two types of people considering this DVD: those who are just general fans and know nothing little about the contents and those who already know and have made up their mind about this era of Tom and Jerry. To the first, I'd recommend checking out some of the titles on YouTube first, because these shorts are quite different than the Hanna-Barbera or Chuck Jones films that book end them. Definitely not for everybody and probably not the best purchase for plopping your kids down in front of (though it seems Warners must have given review copies to every mommy and daddy blogger out there, if I can trust Google's search on this title.)

As to the later, if you don't like this era, and many people are vehemently against this period of Tom and Jerry, this isn't going to win you over. But, if you re looking to collect all the Deitch era shorts, looking the best they ever have, in one collection, this is it. All 13 shorts are here, unedited, along with two special features worth checking out. Colors are better than I've ever seen them and the prints are in pretty good shape with no signs I can see of excessive clean up tools used. Audio is crisp and clear.

My only complaint is I would have preferred a Blu-Ray option. To be honest though, I'm shocked that WHV actually put this out at all considering they seem to have moved more into the overpriced burn on demand area for things like this that aren't going to sell a ton. Regardless, I'm very pleased to have this in my collection, finally.",1436400000,2,1522,4.471223021582734
7004479,2,B00TCXZIOY,"As a huge fan of the Gene Deitch Tom and Jerry shorts, I was very happy to see they were finally coming to DVD. These shorts were ahead of their time and a proper release was long overdue. Unfortunately, this isn't it. It's just a money grab. The quality is terrible.

They have the audacity to say they are remastered? Hogwash. My daughter and I frequently catch some of these episodes on Boomerang, which is not an HD channel, and the quality is far superior on those broadcasts.

A shame, but I cannot recommend. Guess old Gene over in the Czech Republic needed some cash.",1435536000,6,575,4.466666666666667
7004480,5,B00TCXZIOY,"I can totally understand why some people hate this short series by Gene Deitch. My guess is they are older folks who were around to see the (more than/less than) twenty year run by Hanna-Barbera. The switch in style and content probably felt counter to everything they had come to like and expect from a Tom & Jerry cartoon.

But I was born in 1973 and by the time I was an avid cartoon watcher, all the major eras of production were being shown at once on weekday and Saturday mornings. I never got used to one era because my earliest experiences were watching the Hanna-Barbera, Gene Deitch, Chuck Jones, second Hanna-Barbera era, and Filmation era (creeping in unnoticed by me from 1980-82) versions all mixed in together in no order, so I was never able to become set in my ways to feel insulted by future changes (except for the Tom and Jerry Kids in 1990, but I was too old by then to really care [I did think it was lame though, just not rage-worthy]).

Which brings us to the Gene Deitch collection. They were made before I was born. I remember as a child noticing the distinct differences in appearance, movement, sound and content. While I am no connoisseur of art I noticed that these were very stylistically different than the others in a very intentional and playful way. Some of them ranked as my all time favorite Tom and Jerry cartoons between the ages of 6-10 yrs old. They were so ""out there"" in thematic content - not just the usual chase and smash at the same old house and yard. Granted, the animation was much more hectic and choppy, but it added a certain energy to the feel of it.

I had no idea this DVD even existed, and it was a few weeks before writing this review that I was out walking the dog at the age of 42, when for no apparent reason I suddenly thought ""I wonder if I could find out who did those handful of cool Tom and Jerry cartoons - maybe they're posted on YouTube."" I got on my phone looked up Tom and Jerry on Wikipedia, and went through the history of production eras. Lo and behold I found Gene Deitch, saw a DVD had been made and new Amazon would have it.

My point is that while some folks hate this series, I love it, and without having even thought about Tom and Jerry for over 20 years, one day I suddenly - out of the blue, remembered my appreciation for the few far out groovy versions from childhood, and immediately/impulsively searched for these very episodes contained on this DVD. It is with the most direct and intentional effort that I specifically sought out - before I even knew his name - the Gene Deitch collection of cartoons. These are amongst my very favorite.

It is rather odd to see such vehement denunciation of these episodes though, especially considering that there were only 13 of them in this short-lived era; after 18 years and over 100 classic episodes you would think those folks would have a better sense of proportion and perspective.",1435449600,3,2914,4.4392523364485985
7004481,4,B00TCXZIOY,"I can understand why some fans would bash Gene Deitch's T&J shorts. But I don't think they are all that bad. I say that because I think the bashers don't know certain criteria.
Here are a few facts. About 1956, MGM chose to allow William Hanna and Joseph Barbera to finish the cartoons to be released in 1957 and 1958, and then close down the cartoon studio and re-release older T&J shorts to theaters thinking they could make more money on older shorts instead of having new ones made. After a year or two, audiences demanded new T&J cartoons (While MGM's cartoon studio closed down, other cartoon studios, like Lantz and Warner Bros., were still making new cartoons.).
So MGM hired Gene Deitch, a respected animator, to make new T&J shorts starting in 1961. Deitch and his crew overseas knew very little about Tom and Jerry, and had to work with tighter budgets. In other words, I think Deitch did the best he could under difficult circumstances. Deitch made 13 cartoons before MGM turned to Warner Bros. legend Chuck Jones for the next 4 years.
As I said, the Gene Deitch shorts are not bad at all, so check them out.",1435276800,3,1120,4.577114427860696
7004482,5,B00TCXZIOY,"I absolutely LOVE this collection.
Not going to gloss over for the content of the cartoons; they are violent , as most Tom & Jerry & other cartoons for that matter back then, but guess what ? We were also more thick skinned back then. We recognized it was violent ,obviously wrong to ever treat an animal that way, & more importantly,  was MAKE BELIEVE.
As far as influencing kids the wrong way, cast your mind back around a year ago to the horrible news of that kid who was shooting kittens with arrows because he ""was bored"". This, after 30 years of sanitized violence free "" I Love you, you Love me"" kids shows. As always, lack of parental guidance is the culprit.
Sorry, old man rant over, now for what this era of Tom & Jerry does for me:
 The UNIQUENESS- It's the Salvador Dali to the Norman Rockwell of the Tom and Jerry before it. It may not be your cup of tea, but there's no denying it's memorable.
After now knowing the back story of this era, & how many factors were stacked against it, I actually respect the finished product more.
The FEELING- Although while watching these as a kid, I was always hoping  the next T&J cartoon to be shown would be a Chuck Jones one, I wasn't disappointed when it was one of these. Especially ""Thicker than Water"" . That episode encapsulates the ""haunting"" feeling of this T&J era. Especially Jerry's ""powdering up"" & twisted grin before going off to terrify Tom, while that sombre music plays. BRRRRRR LOVE IT !!!
The music & sound effects really sell this era. Again, not for everyone,  but definitely memorable.
So, who to recommend this to ? If the words ""artistically inclined, emotive, or spellbound"" apply. If you enjoy seeing the familiar turned on its head.
Tom & Jerry has many facets over the decades. Thanks for reading why this one really shines for me.

7004483,5,B00TCXZIOY,These were my favorite versions of Tom & Jerry.  They were like some of the 1960s Popeyes that I used to like (directed also by Gene Deitch and produced by William Snyder).  I liked the movements and clean lines of these cartoons.  I honestly didn't like the more serious looking Tom and Jerrys.,1433980800,2,295,4.528301886792453
7004484,5,B00TCXZIOY,"Exactly as advertised. You are getting the complete 1961-62 Gene Deitch run of Tom & Jerry shorts.. that kooky period that felt like a bizaro alternate universe version of our favorite cat and mouse team as interpreted by a Czech animation team that had never seen an actual Tom & Jerry cartoon before and were working on miniscule budget. Some Tom & Jerry fans HATE this era... to which I ask, WHY are you commenting on or reviewing this product?

There is a 20-minute interview with Deitch on the disc (he fully recognizes his work is not beloved by all, and seems to take it in good stride) and a 20-minute retrospective on the history of Tom & Jerry.

8701248,5,B00TCXZIOY,"It was 60 years ago this month that Hanna-Barbera's TV studio was made and they started out on TV with Ruff and Reddy, also in 1957. Shortly beforehand, MGM shut down their animated shorts department, and everyone was temporary without jobs. Luckily, they continued on TV for the rest of their careers, or even their lives, in the case of the founders themselves! Somehow in 1960, Gene Deitch was hired to reinvent Tom & Jerry in his own wild and surrealistic ways, albeit small budgets, right down to his shorts' animation being outsourced to Prague, Czechoslovakia, whose people never even saw the original Hanna-Barbera Tom and Jerry shorts! Even in spite of such drawbacks, many fans of Tom & Jerry, myself included, longed to have the whole Gene Deitch era on DVD, especially after the Golden Collection got cancelled from the debacle with Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat! In the summer of 2015, we finally got our wish; all 13 Tom & Jerry shorts from the Gene Deitch era (1960-'62) are on 1 DVD, completely remastered, with a couple of bonus documentaries! Make sure your Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collections have company with Gene Deitch and Chuck Jones eras! Heaven knows why the WB keeps making new Tom & Jerry AND Scooby Movies on DVD every year!
