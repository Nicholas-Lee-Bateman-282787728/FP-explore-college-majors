7885878,4,6305235155,"I deducted a star for middle-of-the-road-resolution (adequate), and the frequent spelling errors (I do not speak Cantonese).  The rapid-fire translation is English but reflects the Chinese syntax.  I prefer the accuracy of the dialogue, but it does give the head a workout.. This is a mid-eighties Hong Kong movie, produced by the master Sammo Hung--watch for the cameo appearance..  This movie does not provide intricate plot structure or subtle character development.  You watch it for the super-tight choreography that the death-defying Sammo Hung stunt team provides in spades.  This is a very early role for former Miss Malaysia, Michelle Yeoh--who is already carving her niche,.  Cynthia Rothrock is at her best--easily keeping up with the other masters on stage.",1352937600,5,769,5.420168067226891
7885879,5,6305235155,"The movie itself is so-so. The fight at the end is totally worth the purchase price. Michelle and Cynthia are amazing to see, over and over.",1294272000,,140,4.423076923076923
7885880,4,6305235155,"The mid-`80s was an exciting time for Hong Kong cinema: through the efforts of fresh young filmmakers like Tsui Hark, Siu-Tung Ching, and Corey Yuen, the movie landscape evolved from formulaic wuxia fare to the varied and creative land of possibility that it's known as today. Among the emerging new trends was the broadening of roles for female action heroes, and thus, the ""girls with guns"" subgenre was revived almost solely by Corey Yuen via this movie, which introduced to-be stars Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock to the world. Several more films made in this one's mold would follow, but virtually none would measure up to its balance, which helped make Hong Kong's unorthodox sense of humor and unrivaled action direction more accessible to international audiences.

The story: Inspector Ng (Yeoh,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>) unravels a murder case involving lost microfilm, three goofy criminal brothers (John Sham of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winners-and-Sinners/dp/B0007IO704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winners and Sinners</a>, Hoi Mang of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zu-Warriors-From-the-Magic-Mountain/dp/B00023BN2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zu - Warriors From the Magic Mountain</a>, and Tsui Hark), and a crime network run by a sadistic businessman (James Tien,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chinese-Connection/dp/B00005BCKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chinese Connection</a>). Joined by Scotland Yard graduate Carrie Morris (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>), they utilize their distinctive investigative techniques to edge closer to their quarry before falling back on their unrivaled martial arts skills to save the day.

As much as I like action movies and am grateful for the choreographical innovation Hong Kong has historically has given the film world, Hong Kong movies haven't ever been my preferred fare due to their tendency to stray into territory less-than-accessible to western audiences - specifically, their flowery brand of humor has always left me blinking in confusion at the subtitles. ""Yes Madam!"" is guilty of some of this, too, but through the efforts of the clown trio of John Sham, Hoi Mang, and Tsui Hark, physical humor takes precedence a lot of time and makes the laughs a lot easier to come by. The three of them actually have as much screentime as Yeoh and Rothrock, and while it's a bit disappointing that they detract from the female leads, they make the most of their time without coming off as scene-stealers...and besides, any scene in which Tsui Hark gets to show off his athleticism by initiating a full-scale chase scene within the confines of his apartment is not a wasted scene.

The action, of course, is what we're interested in most of all - to see Michelle and Cynthia kicking the snot out of every villain they come across. Sadly, it takes a while to get there - coinciding with the arrival of Rothrock's character about a half-hour into the film - and is generally delivered in moderation until the final twenty minutes...but oh, what a final twenty minutes they are. A nonstop fight scene erupts in which our two leads take on a slew of henchmen with swords and an ornamental umbrella before entering an awesome two-on-two battle of the sexes with Dick Wei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Chan-s-Project-A/dp/630580379X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie Chan's Project A</a>) and Fat Chung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spooky-Encounters/dp/B0007IO6Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spooky Encounters</a>). I'll never know how Cynthia Rothrock was singled out as the first Caucasian to star in a Hong Kong hero role or how Michelle Yeoh made the switch from dancer to kung fu fighter, but their physical offerings here alone make me glad that they did: despite the obviousness of some stunt doubles, both of them do the vast majority of their own stuff and perform as though their futures in show business depended on it, and the effort pays off for the fact that even twenty-five years later, this remains among the very best fights scenes of both their careers.

Still, the fact that there's only one truly notable scene like this - not to mention some weird characterization of Rothrock's super-angry onscreen persona - keeps the film from attaining a four-star rating. It's definitely of the upper crust of Hong Kong fight flicks, but still a bit too padded with filler for my liking. Rest assured, Yeoh and Rothrock completionists would do well to scour the internet for an affordable release of this; it's still a sight to be seen.",1275955200,,5012,6.17621776504298
7885881,4,6305235155,"this was a fun movie michelle yeoh is in it, that's all that matters. i just wished that they would stop with the subtitles and dub it in english for region 1 viewers.",1112313600,2,167,4.090909090909091
7885882,1,6305235155,It is bad movie. Most of sences are joke stupidly and non-sense. At the beginning of the film indicated a dirty kind of joke that is usually see in Asian movies. It is very cheap joke for low class audiences.,1059955200,,208,4.225
7885883,5,6305235155,"I watched this after watching Royal Warriors (aka In the Line of Duty II, also with Michelle Yeoh) and this film was great as well. Yes, Madam(aka In the Line of Duty or Police Assassins) is about two top police women from their respective countries teaming up to retrieve a micro film which is evidence to put away some mob guy. Well, he's a bad guy with a lot of bodyguards and thats all you need to know. As the ...reviewer said, this is sort of like Rush Hour in reverse. The fighting is ever so awesome and brutal, I cringed several times during this one. Cynthia Rothrock shows a lot of her best stuff here, and Michelle is awesome as usual. .... The last fighting scenes are just magical with great production by Sammo Hung; plenty of crazy kick stunts and flips. However, the dvd isn't the greatest sound wise. It seems some of the sound effects were toned down, and the supposed 5.1 dolby isn't very noticable at all. If you got a Region 2 dvd player w/ PAL converter, then get Hong Kong Legends version which is under the name Police Assassins, I believe the sound was redone and the picture quality is second to none. Tsiu Hark and Sammo both make humorous guest appearances in the film as well. If you liked Royal Warriors, you'll love this and besides, its the prequel to Royal. I believe any martial arts fan will be impressed by this one. Check out Michelles other greats such as Wing Chun, Royal Warriors, CTHD (Crouching Tiger...duh), Magnificent Warriors. The only other Cynthia Rothrock movie that I could safely recommend is Righting Wrongs which is totally awesome. I would definitely recommend a buy with all these titles including Yes, Madam...check it out...hope this and my other HK flicks reviews are helpful.",1011225600,17,1735,4.636363636363637
7885884,1,6305235155,"...you will most likely find it under the U.K. release title, ""Police Assassins 2"".  THAT movie starred Cynthia Rothrock and Michelle Yeoh and is the most kick-butt, femme fatale movie of all time!",957571200,3,197,4.96969696969697
7885885,1,6305235155,"I bought the movie and had to return it because it is not the Yes Madam with Cynthia Rothrock in it.  This is some stupid english dubbed movie that makes no sense at all and is very ignorant.  If your looking for Cynthia,  look some where else this is not the right movie.",936489600,7,272,4.09433962264151
