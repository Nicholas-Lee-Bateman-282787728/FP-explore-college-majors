874819,5,6304435878,"Southern Comfort is one of those brilliant films that no one has heard of.  The director is Walter Hill and this is one of his best films.  Unfortunately, it is also one of his least well known.  The film stars Peter Coyote, Powers Boothe and Keith Carradine, among others.  You will see a lot of familiar faces.  A group of National Guardsman are on a routine training mission in the Louisiana bayou (of course, they have just blanks).  They are to go to a specified location but when they get there, there is just water.  They ""borrow"" three canoes to continue their mission, leaving a note.  As they are paddling down stream, they see the owners of the canoes on the shore.  They yell to them to look at the note they left and one of the guardsman fires his machine gun filled with blanks at the crowd as a joke.  The men on shore return fire (with live ammunition) and kill the ranking officer.  The men get out of the canoes and into the forest as quickly as possible and soon come to realize they are being tracked by the killers.  They happen upon a cajun who they just know is one of the ones who fired upon them and take him captive.  As they continue through the bayou in search of the highway, they are hunted and picked off one by one.  It is soon evident that the remaining ranking officer is not capable of leading them out of the wilderness alive.  Eventually, only two are left and they happen upon some ""nice"" cajuns but trouble soon follows.  It is do or die and they are in for the fight of their lives.  The story is tense and exciting, the picture adequate, but the sound is substandard.  If they had taken the trouble to remaster the sound in Dolby Digital, this DVD would have been simply outstanding.  Look this one up, you won't regret it!",991699200,,1764,4.339449541284404
874820,4,6304435878,"...Southern Comfort is... an interesting and action-packed movie from the prolific director Walter Hill. While it shares the same ""city-folk vs.backwoods dwellers"" theme as Deliverance, Southern Comfort is distinctive in its overall atmosphere of menace and foreboding.
A group of National Guardsman on training manuevers in the Louisiana swamps are hunted down by [angry] Cajuns, and the worst part is, the weapons the Guardsman carry are loaded with blanks! The movie turns into a battle of wits and survival for the Guardsman, with civilization tantalizingly close by, but unknown danger standing in the way.
I saw this movie as a kid, and I still remember it years later. I recommend this movie as a fine example of Walter Hill's lean direction and his unique eye for stylized violence, along the lines of Sam Peckinpah. It's also offered at a good price, so you can't go wrong.",984096000,3,882,5.0479452054794525
874821,5,6304435878,"Director Walter Hill's 1981 action drama has a horror movie mentality. When a group of weekend service members of the Louisiana National Guard venture into bayou country on training maneuvers, a misunderstanding leads to them being stalked and methodically hunted down by local Cajuns. However the screenplay which Hill co-wrote with Michael Kane and the producer David Giler, provides more depth and character interplay than something like Scream where the killings are all there is. Another definite plus is the soundtrack, where silence is employed during the attacks. This is both a superior aesthetic choice and a contextual one since the main locale is the lonely mythic swampland, stark in it's beauty and primordial terror. The fact that the attacks take place in daylight is another subversion of the horror genre, though the Cajuns function on the same level as a generic stalker, seen out of the corner of one's eye and possessing greater agility than those they hunt. Of course it helps that the swamps are the Cajun's home turf since this makes the Guardsmen more vulnerable. Hill never telegraphs the next death so that the viewer carries a constant feeling of dread. The swampland being so beautiful and the savagery of the killings also recalls the irony of the murders at Auschwitz, which was said to be gorgeous countryside. Hill perhaps overplays his Vietnam parable when he presents one man going to his death in slow motion, in an attempt to enoble someone whose leadership the others have criticised for trying to stick to the manual. But considering that the narrative is set in 1973, it is interesting to interpret the assault on the Guardsmen as anti-military, a point made when the surviving men make it to a Cajun camp, and the expected relief of civilisation turns to continued paranoia. It's not only that the Cajuns only speak French that sets them apart. Early in the film Hill overlaps a pan of the men's discussion of what to do with the vertical sight of them walking, an unusual representation of thought via editing. Sometimes these continuous discussions are disappointingly reductive, no matter how true to life they seem, but occasionally they provide a gem eg. When it is said to a black man that the Cajuns fear ""niggers"" as bad luck, the black man replies with ""They may be right. I've been hanging around with niggers all my life and I haven't had a break yet"". The line is funny, probably more so because it comes from a black man, and also prophetic. The ending is a problem. As Pauline Kael says in her review of the film in her collection Taking It All In, it brings you up short. It's too abrupt and ambiguous, but this is ultimately a trifle considering the care Hill has taken and his ""dazzling competence"" (Kael) we have been witness to.",981849600,18,2788,4.822546972860125
874822,5,6304435878,"Unfairly dismissed at the time as a Deliverance duplicate,  Walter Hill's  Southern Comfort is infact a surprisingly  well executed military thriller.
 Keith Carradine, Powers Boothe and Fred Ward lead a well construted male cast playing National Guardsmen stranded in the Louisiana swampland after a dumb prank backfires.
 An economical script, richly atmospheric cinematography and a haunting Ry Cooder score help make this one of Hill's best.

875232,5,6304435878,"This recent Blu-Ray remastering from Shout! Factory is a big improvement on the original MGM DVD release. The reason I can't call it a huge improvement is that excessive grain and maybe some pixilation is apparent in wide-angle landscape shots. Shooting conditions were difficult, even for an on-location shoot, but even with that allowance, I can't help wishing that some of the shots of the Louisiana bayou looked cleaner than they do.

However, with that bad news out of the way, I can claim that this Blu-Ray will have SC aficionados trembling and shaking with excitement at just how much better this little-known classic looks and sounds. I said some bad things about the picture quality, but Andrew Laszlo's cinematography frequently looks great--as far as I'm concerned, a lot of it qualifies as fine-art photography. Eerie beauty and malingering menace come through in equal measure. The soundtrack is mono, but it sounds very immediate and close. Ry Cooder's signature score sounds better than ever.

As for extras, Walter Hill and David Giler participate in Skype interviews superimposed on scenes from the movie. So Hill and Giler comment on the movies while scenes are playing in the background--what the chipheads call PIP, that is, picture in the picture. It's very impressive and very informative.

One topic that will intrigue fans of this film is the whole question of whether or not it's an allegory about the Vietnam War. Most of us have always taken it on faith that it is. But in the interviews, both Hill and Giler waffle on the point. They neither confirm nor deny but leave it up to the viewer. Personally, I think the movie is at the very least a strong anti-war movie, so I'm in the uncomfortable situation of disagreeing with the director and the producer. But you'll have to hear both men for yourself and make your own decision.

The only small complaint is that the marketing folks at Shout! Factory screwed up with the packaging big-time. They included blurbs on the package cover that compare the movie to Deliverance (one of which misspells the word ""deliverance""). First, Southern Comfort is frequently misperceived as a rip-off of Deliverance. To continue that misperception might discourage new buyers. The point of marketing is make people buy your product, not ignore it. Second, the comparison between Deliverance and SC has always been misguided. The comments of Hill and Giler notwithstanding, the theme of SC is anti-war whereas the theme of Deliverance is Man vs. Nature. Despite numerous but circumstantial similarities, the movies really could not be more different. In my humble opinion, Southern Comfort has always been the finer film.

On a 5 star ranking system, I give this Blu-ray release of Southern Comfort from Shout! Factory 10 out of 5 stars.",1447804800,8,2798,5.008602150537635

875236,4,6304435878,"Walter Hill (The Warriors, The Driver) is such an underrated filmmaker. He quietly put together a great cast of mostly unknowns at the time, which included Keith Carradine, Fred Ward and Powers Boothe, all of whom turned in excellent performances in this movie.

The premise is relatively simple. A group of misfits (Dirty Dozen) in the Louisiana National Guard are sent out on a routine mission strapped with automatic weapons and bandoliers. The only problem is, the ammo is almost entirely made up of blank rounds. They quickly find themselves lost in the Cajun underbelly of the Louisiana swamplands and when bad turns to worse, they soon realize they are being hunted by the locals (Deliverance).

While SoCo may not be as well made as Deliverance (released 9 years prior) it is different enough that it does not feel like you are just watching a repeat of another film. The dialogue between the characters helps flesh out the development and add to the tension in the movie.

The final scene really makes the movie, with an exceptional setup that is really executed to perfection. If you like anything Walter Hill has done before, you will likely enjoy Southern Comfort.",1442966400,2,1176,4.899497487437186

875601,5,6304435878,"Over 40 years ago when I saw this film I marked it down as the second film (""Go Tell the Spartans"" first) to satirize the Vietnam conflict, the best to depict the morass so clearly. So, when I started watching it again it was all new and more painful to watch. Like Vietnam, these Louisiana boys (most combat vets were southern, dark not fried) in a National Guard unit are out for harmless maneuvers in the swamps with their military 'training,' combat inexperience and no useful map. Worse than that, they primarily have blank ammunition. Which makes the parallels real. Our military forces were always lacking the 'necessary' vitals to jungle, swampy warfare, like artillery. Or napalm. Or Agent Orange. Sure. Here, the unit becomes disorganized and lost when their leader is executed by real firepower when one of their own plays Dillinger with an M-60 (blanks) for laughs on a couple Creole (slope-eyes) hunters. A new leader fills in, the unit regroups and begins acting like a military group by getting lost. One guy goes crazy. Rather than seeking a truce from the Creole party, they antagonize them into hunting them down. Maintaining their war mentality when they come across a house with food and ammunition, one of the guardsmen accidentally sets it ablaze as if it was a hooch. Blammo! There goes their reserves. Like ""Ten Little Indians,"" the guardsmen fall victim to their own fears or stupidity waiting for the saving helicopter ride out. It doesn't come. After another day passes, two of them 'ol boys make it to civilization, as you would put it, inside a creole celebration. That is spoiled too when two of the Creole war party invade the fun and mayhem takes place with two limping guardsmen escaping for another day. There now, doesn't that summarize the 15 year Vietnam conflict? This is a hell of a walk in a swamp. Think ""Deliverance,"" instead of insurance agents traveling upstream, there's 25 or so guardsmen about ready to get their dipsticks wet. Big time. Of course, military minds rarely get inspired by fiction. Very bad for us  today.",1413417600,,2066,4.836158192090395

875688,5,6304435878,"Southern Comfort is a little-known 80's action/chase film directed by Walter Hill, of ""The Warriors"" and ""48 Hours"" acclaim. It stars Keith Carradine and Powers Boothe in roles that largely flew under the radar of moviegoers. Walter Hill later admitted that Southern Comfort ""didn't make a f------ nickel anywhere. Foreign domestic, anything... I was proud of the film... But I was disappointed in the lack of response. It was a universal audience failure... Usually you can say they loved it in Japan or something. I don't think anybody loved it anywhere."" This is sad due to how powerful an impact this movie makes by the time the credits roll.

Though released in 1981, everything about Southern Comfort still reeks of Nixon-era paranoia. The film focuses on a half-cocked patrol of Louisiana National Guardsmen sent on a weekend training exercise that has them sloshing through the endless bayou. The men are more focused on smoking cigarettes, getting trashed, and jive talking each other than carrying out objectives (not that there were any to begin with). They are dumb, naive, and about as effective as pack of retarded mall cops. When one decides to fire blanks at a nearby group of Cajuns for laughs, all hell breaks loose when the Cajuns misinterpret it as a real attack and shoot back with real ammunition. Each member of the patrol is quietly picked off one-by-one, until only Private Spencer (Keith Carradine) and Corporal Hardin (Powers Boothe) are left.

The soundtrack is excellent and reminiscent of the 80's, complete with southern-fried guitar licks and a lazy ambiance that makes you want to down a bottle of the whiskey the movie is named after. In recent years, there have been a number of films that were no-doubt inspired by Southern Comfort. The British horror movie Dog Soldiers (2002) and Lone Survivor (2013) come to mind, with the latter being a closer adaptation that swaps Cajuns for terrorists. Even now, Southern Comfort still reigns supreme as a cult-classic of the genre. 5-stars.",1411171200,,2017,5.017910447761194

875694,4,6304435878,"I have often wanted to see this film. I really don't know why I never have but now that Shout! Factory released this on a beautiful Blu-ray I thought I would give it a chance. This is a perfect cast of characters and a wild unrelenting fear style of film-making. Yes this goes up there with the likes of Deliverance but I feel this is on another level for the simple fact it's more of an action film mixed with a psychological reality of survival and basically has a social commentary to it, even if it is not meant to be. Not just a few men trying to live but a whole group trained in the warrior style of survival.

Each one of these characters have their flaws and also the jerk attitude of ignorance when it comes to messing with certain things. I live in the south and know for a fact you don't mess with locals, especially small town and back woods folk. There's a lot of unexplored land and many filled holes across many valleys, and I will leave it at that.

I feel this is an amazing drama and a true adventure thriller set up for the viewer. I think ultimately its the psychological drama which makes this film stand out as something very bright and something brutal in the idea of people messing with a way of life and then that messing around leads to a destructive reckoning. The survival scenario in a sense plays with your mind and also the will to further yourself through the bad ordeal. I think the viewer can relate to this more than Deliverance because with Deliverance, I would never be in that situation in the first place. The reality of these warriors out training is different, in that its a part of the training idea. The men in Deliverance choose to be in the backwoods, rape you in the butt reality. Don't get me wrong I love Deliverance its an amazing movie and awesome book. It's a classic. Southern Comfort I think is a deeper subject because I feel there is a statement being made in the idea and remarks throughout about Americas military force and actions. I feel there is an underlining statement about Vietnam War and also the bringing up of the National Guard and police force with tear gas and marches on campuses.

Southern Comfort is a believable scary reality. Being hunted is something when you think about it, it is a frightening idea. I do feel the film is way too long and that is one of its down falls. It could have easily been cut by 20 minutes. There was a lot of running around and the same shot of them doing that too much. The inner fighting was continues and seemed overdone, yes we know certain characters are pricks, lets move on. Another reality the viewer contemplates, what are our characters? Are they good, bad or what?

875763,4,6304435878,"I've been a fan of Walter Hill for as long as I can remember. While some of the movies of his I've loved never became the hits they should have (STREETS OF FIRE) others have shown that he is quite the bankable director (48 HOURS). His movies often depicted a world where men were men and weren't afraid to be what they were in a world where people seemed to want to soften them instead. It made his films ones that guys loved and revere to this day. A testosterone fueled battle was at the core of his film SOUTHERN COMFORT.

The movie revolves around a weekend training exercise for the Louisiana National Guard. This gathering of weekend warriors is set to travel from point A to point B over that weekend. The problems come from the combination of characters in the group. Their leader is Poole (Peter Coyote), a no nonsense ex-military man destined to be a leader. His second in command is Casper (Les Lannom), a man who follows orders. While this pair seems to understand the need for their group to follow commands it is the rest of the crew that forms a band of misfits and screwballs that will lead to nothing but problems.

Reece and Stuckey (Fred Ward and Lewis Smith) are two stereotypical rednecks with little desire to rise above the life they've chosen. Simms and Cribbs (Franklyn Seals and T.K. Carter) are two black soldiers in the group with completely different personalities, the first always on edge and the latter far too laid back. Bowden (Alan Autry) offers that intensely gung ho attitude up front but crumbles in a clinch. Spencer (Keith Carradine) is the calm and collected guy who knows the best path to take but since he seems a smooth operator rarely is listened to. And at the end is Hardin (Powers Boothe), a transfer from Texas who just wants to get his time in the Guard over with so he can move on with his life.

As this rag tag group sets out they discover their map is out of date and the waters have risen where they need to cross. Finding a set of boats and trapped animals they decide to borrow the boats from the Cajun trappers and leave a note explaining this. As they cross the trappers return and while watching them Stuckey fires his machine gun, loaded with blanks, in their direction thinking how funny it is. In return, the Cajuns shoot and kill Poole. Bowden tips all the boats and the group is left with a few less needed items (like the map), a dead body and a fear that the men will be tracking them down now.

What follows is a combination of stories, one being the Cajuns trying to get to the men and take them all down for what they consider an opening salvo in their direction. The second story is the bigger one as we watch the group implode with some characters trying to become the dominant male, the alpha dog, the leader of the pack while the actual men who have that ability to lead lay back and don't show that skill until push comes to shove. Not only do these men have to worry about the trappers following them, they have to worry about what one of their own might do to jeopardize their lives as well.

As the group gets picked off one at a time you begin to wonder if any of them will survive this weekend. With no way to contact their home base and several days before anyone will find them missing, they trek through the dangerous bayou that's unfamiliar terrain for them but home for the trappers. Their attempt to physically find their way out to civilization is one harrowing journey but it's the search for being civilized that makes for a more interesting story.

Shout Factory has done a fantastic job of offering a great print of this movie that is sure to please those waiting for a blu-ray edition of this film. While many were angered by Fox's treatment of PREDATOR for making the film appear too clean filled with altered images, this film offers the graininess of film from that time in parts while offering as sharp an image as one would have expected from those days. Eighties film fans will rejoice.

There are no bad performances in this film and stand outs are offered from Carradine and Boothe in the main leads. The rest of the cast is up to the standards set by these two and make their characters believable as well. Perhaps the only noticeable flaw in the film is that at times the characters seem a bit dated but then again as I've told people before, you must always try and place yourself in the time period when a movie was made rather than watch it from through the eyes of the time period you live in. It may only be 30 odd years since the film came out but that's a lot of change.

In the end what you have here is a dynamite action film with more meat surrounding the bone in terms of story that these films are used to. It's a Walter Hill film at its best and isn't one that you will want to just watch but will probably want to add to your collection.",1405468800,,4853,4.36655592469546

875888,4,6304435878,"""Southern Comfort"" is a rip-roaring good story. An example of a (dying?) breed of military movies;  A look at military personnel as people first...and not as cold-blooded, heroic, robotic killing machines.  Aside from a few fumbles, it is a good illustration of actual, real, flawed  human beings caught in a real dilemma based on their own misunderstandings and personal  character defects.  Just don't go into this movie expecting something like ""Saving Private Ryan"".  The level of on-screen gore is kept to a minimal level.
  The movie is about a  group of Louisiana National Guard citizen-soldiers on a training exercise in the swamps. Most of these people are more citizen...than soldier;  Through a stupid practical joke, they become caught up in a largely senseless deadly conflict with a group of  rural swamp Cajuns.  A struggle which will end in death for some.
  Yes, the movie is laced with the social attitudes of the late seventies.  Namely, the then current  popular craze of military-bashing.  Much the opposite of today's Zeitgest of gold-plating and lionizing all things military.
  Will this bother some viewers  in today's social and political climate?  Probably.  But those of us old (and aware) enough to  have seen these extremes of  public opinion swing from one pole to another several times... have come to appreciate the benefits of a compelling, well-told story of survival...regardless of the underlying socio-political assumptions which usually lie  hidden between the lines of movie scripts.
  Almost no work of contemporary fiction or non-fiction escapes the mind prison of its own era. The time's beliefs and prejudices are imbedded within the work's thought matrix.  This is often not noticed by those caught up in the existing popular attitudes-but can be jarringly apparent to those outside that  set of beliefs.  In any case, I found this movie  an entertaining one.",1361664000,4,1904,5.2052980132450335

I saw this when it first came out, and I saw it again recently on you tube.  No, I'm not going to pay a small fortune for this DVD from Amazon, since it will probably be out for $5 in Walmart the year after next.

As an outdoorsman, I ask, how did these National Guardsmen keep from hypothermia?  The Cajuns were wearing clothing that you wear when it hits near freezing.  Yea, I know that they're outdoors, so wear more than we would simply making it from car to building, but come on, the Guardsmen were soaked in weather so cold that at least one Cajun wore a down vest.  No sleeping bags, no tents--no way!

Why Cajuns keep dancing during a gunfight 30 yards away is beyond me.  Sure, they killed two pigs with guns.  But where is common sense?  As if they didn't know SOMETHING was wrong with all that gunfire, even if they couldn't see it?

And the ""bloopers"".  Didn't Stucky have LIVE ammunition slung over his shoulder?  Or do blanks look that real?  And how did a handful of live ammo last ""so long""?  And the song ""Parlez-nous a Boire"" must have been doctored.  As I listened, the first verse was sung once, and the second verse sung thrice.  The song actually has four verses plus the refrain.  I assume that the sound engineers are responsible for that one.

I did appreciate that they used ""real Cajuns"".  Looking at that crowd near the end of the movie, nearly everybody had dark hair, and most of the faces were typically French (I spent some time in France).  That's French culture, all right.  They didn't have a bunch of blond-haired blue-eyed ""American"" Indians like on one movie I saw.

Then these goons come after them? ok, I give alot worse horror movies higher ratings because I have a horror movie rating scale , in truth most of them are two stars in comparison to a a movie. but this is a A movie , if it weren't for the acting I would give it two stars.

876109,4,6304435878,"This seldom-mentioned little film from the early eighties is in actuality a pretty darned good flick.  Director Walter Hill delivers a story with impact, beautiful visuals, and enough of a message about the darkness of man to please anyone.

The basic plot is that a group of National Guardsmen, out on maneuvers, run afoul of local Cajun hunter/trappers deep in the Louisiana swamps...but the reason they run afoul is their own creation.  You see, these civilian-soldiers lean HEAVILY to the ""civilian"" side of that coin; there's very little discipline, and they cut all kinds of corners to hurry to their destination (you see, there's prostitutes allegedly waiting at the end of the line).  So our protagonists, while some rise above, are not really the kind of people we'd want to hang out and barbecue with.

The group, due largely to their own ineptitude, faced with a local population who is familar with their terrain and saavy in their tactics, is slowly decimated by attrition by the phantom-like backwoods people.  Here is where the movie shines:  The misty, mossy swamp is a character unto itself; claustrophobia in the wide-open wilderness, and Hill shoots this very well.

The performances range from excellent (Powers Boothe, Fred Ward) to very good (pretty much the rest of the cast).  You get some pretty graphic violence, but nothing that will put you off your popcorn (well, except maybe one scene, which I'll get to in a minute).  Top it off with a haunting yet eerily appropriate score from Ry Cooder (although a 5.1 remaster would have been nice, you can't have it all, I s'pose), and your result is a movie that delivers a powerful message but in an entertaining way.

It's easy to draw a line from this movie to be a metaphor for the war in Vietnam (largely green troops facing a cunning indigenous foe), and the often-made comparison to ""Deliverance"" is also understood, but I think even without such shoulders to stand on the film is a nice piece of work, and can be enjoyed by anyone, whether you're looking for allegorical lessons or not.

Now, the one thing that's a little extreme:  I kind of railed against ""Cannibal Holocaust"" for it's use of actual animal slaughter, and this film does show, in lurid detail, the killing and skinning of wild boar.  I grew up in the south; I've seen all of this before, and I realize that in the context of this film the boar were honestly and actually being slaughtered for food, but I still feel it was a bit much.  I understand the director's desire to use the scene for dramatic reasons, but it could have been done with special effects.  The argument I suppose could be made that the Cajun extras were doing it anyway, why waste time and money for an effects shot when you have the real thing right here?  But if I'm gonna gripe about it in one movie, I gotta be fair...so if you're squeamish or are thinking about letting your kids watch it, be advised.

Overall, a very good, entertaining film.  If you liked ""Deliverance"", or are a fan of the ""man against insurmountable odds"" kind of flick, you should give this one a watch.",1284422400,,3098,4.693160813308688
876110,4,6304435878,This is truly a classic. I don't think it was meant to be a comedy but me and my brothers find this hilarious!!!,1265760000,,112,3.9130434782608696
876111,3,6304435878,"Walter Hill is known as a hit and miss filmmaker. When he's good he's good (""The Warriors,"" ""The Long Riders,"" ""Hard Times"") and when he's bad he's mediocre at best (""Wild Bill""). 1981's ""Southern Comfort"" mostly falls into the mediocre category but it definitely has a great ending.

THE PLOT: A group of National Guardsmen get lost in the Louisianna swamps and steal some Cajun boats to paddle out. One soldier offends the probable owners even worse by shooting blanks at them. The Guardsmen soon find themselves in a life or death struggle to get out; unfortunately most of their ammo consists of blanks.

I guess the story is supposed to be a metaphor for the Vietnam conflict, but I've always viewed it at face value as a swamp survival adventure.

Most of the Guardsmen are unlikable and the viewer can't help but feel they're getting what they deserve, but I found both Keith Caradine and Powers Boothe somewhat likable, which is good since they ultimately become the story's protagonists.

For about an hour and a half the soldiers conflict with the barely-seen Cajuns as their numbers slowly dwindle. The main problems I have with the film are found within this large chunk of the movie. Aside from the Guardsmen being a generally annoying group of people, things repeatedly happen that are unbelievable. The loon blowing up the shack is a good example. Or what about the booby trap that takes out one of the soldiers? How would the Cajuns possibly know the soldiers would walk in that precise area? Then there's the numerous falling trees. How exactly are these huge trees falling over and why do we never see the Cajuns and, again, how did the Cajuns know the soldiers would walk through that precise area (a swamp with no trails)? All these factors screamed at me that this is a movie, not reality. In other words, I wasn't able to suspend disbelief and buy into the story. The film is sometimes mentioned in the same breath as ""Deliverance,"" but ""Deliverance"" stands head and shoulders over ""Southern Comfort"" because ""Deliverance"" is believable from beginning to end; hence, the horror and suspense is real to the viewer. ""Southern Comfort,"" by contrast, is just a movie with contrived sequences.

The commendable thing about ""Southern Comfort,"" however, is that it has a really good final Act. From the point where the protagonists encounter the one-armed Cajun at the railroad tracks the film enters into the realm of greatness. Some of the Guardsmen make their way to a small Cajun village in the swamp where a celebration is going on and they experience serious paranoia trying to figure out who's friend or foe.

Filmed on location in the swamps of Louisianna and Texas, the film runs 106 minutes.

The cast are are all good and director Walter Hill perhaps peaked with this film.

The story is slight, but effective, some National Guardsmen upset the locals whilst out on an exercise. The locals aren't happy and seek to punish the soldiers in various horrible ways. When you see this unfold you will begin to see that maybe this film was an influence on the first Rambo film and even perhaps Predator.

In Platoon, it's the Viet Cong who killed the American soldiers. In Southern Comfort, it's the Cajuns who murdered the National Guardsmen.

What supposed to be a suspenseful movie turned out to be a bland picture. The acting look stiff, fake and unemotional. I was never scared during the whole film. In one scene, a Guardsman was so frightened that he went crazy. He cut and painted himself just like an Indian who was going to war. And yet the act did not stir up any suspense or emotion at all. On the contrary, the similar scene in Predator is truly gripping.

876204,5,6304435878,"This film came out just as I was finishing a six-year stint with the Louisiana National Guard, so I eagerly went to see it soon after its release. I enjoyed it so much then that I bought a copy on DVD when reminded of it after I bought ""Deliverance"".

Though there are surface similarities, Southern Comfort is not Deliverance Louisiana-style, though it may have attracted much the same viewers.

I won't rehash the story to a great extent, but I want to point out a few errors in the film before singing its hosannahs. First of all, if the Guard unit started its exercise in the Catahoula swamp and was supposed to pass through the Great Dismal Swamp (they called it the Great Primordial Swamp in the film) to a rendezvous with another unit, there would have been precious few Cajuns as those swamps are north of the Red River. Most Cajuns live south of that river and west of the Mississippi. Secondly, the interstate which ""Casper"" kept referring to would have been Interstate 20, 100 miles to the north and they'd have crossed many other roads before that. The type of swamp the unit was in would be far more likely south of Interstate 10, 100 miles to the south of where the movie placed them. Finally, there would probably have been at least a couple of the troops who could speak Cajun French. My unit, based at Pineville LA, had a good mix of North Louisiana ""rednecks"" as Cajuns referred to them and South Louisiana ""coon-asses"" as the Cajuns called themselves. A lot of the Cajun guys were fluent in Cajun French. As for the troopers themselves, we did have one guy in our unit reminiscent of the wild-eyed punk in the film who got the real trouble started by firing blanks at the Cajun trappers, but beyond that they were a decent bunch of men and women.

With that straightened out, lets talk about the movie. This is a great story about men under stress, how they interact and how they respond to fear. Some keep their heads, some snivel and whine, while others go berserk. You have prototypes of all three in this film. Texas Guard transferee Powers Boothe is the most level-headed of the group, you somehow know that he is going to make it.

The Cajuns themselves are shown as pretty one-dimensional characters until the end, but that's because these particular Cajuns live life in the shadows and are involved in many activities of questionable legality. Only at the end, when Boothe and Carradine seemingly have saved themselves and find themselves in the middle of a real Mardi Gras, is the fun-loving devil may care side of the Cajun soul bared.

That one-armed Cajun trapper who was captured and tortured by the guardsmen spared Boothe and Carradine near the end and gave them directions out of the swamp, but probably only because Boothe had saved him from further torture and he recognised that both guardsmen were essentially decent men. But, as the trapper warns them, the others are not as nice as he is.

Apart from the unlikely storyline itself, you will be transfixed by this Southern-Fried Film Noir. You have people from the outside world pitted against an insular and seemingly peculiar minority. You have the unrelenting gloom of the setting, whether it be in the swamp and all its clues of impending doom, or at the bayou-side Mardi Gras with all sinister symbolism that keeps up the suspense and the viewer on edge. The dark and gloomy atmosphere is sustained by the brooding and mysterious soundtrack by Ry Cooder.

I heartily recommend Southern Comfort to anyone who enjoys dark action films, to those for whom the swamps of Louisiana stir a mixture of curiosity and dread, and for anyone who has not been to backwoods Louisiana who might like to see what a real Cajun party sans tourists may be like.",1157414400,43,3737,4.661608497723824

876206,3,6304435878,"Watching the Keith Carradine/Powers Boothe vehicle"" Southern Comfort"" is a bit like eating a big bowl of vanilla ice cream-- yoiu pretty much know what you're in for, no real surprises, but it can still be enjoyable as hell if that's what you're in the mood for.

  The characters are all walking cliches-- the smart outsider, too intellectual for the ignorant rednecks he's stuck with (Boothe) the good ol' boy who's brighter than he lets on (Carradine), the hip black urbanite surrounded by crackers, the sidekick hispanic, the religious whacko, and the badass redneck who thinks the rules were made for other people. Oh, and let's not forget the halfwit ninety-day wonder of a CO, who everybody wants to see fragged, and finally, the obligatory inscrutable cajuns, at the same time both evil for attacking our boys in green, and sympathetic because ""they are just defending their homeland/they got attacked first.""

  To say that this is a thinly veiled, ham-handed commentary on the Vietnam war would be to give the director far too much credit for subtlety. While the action is steady, the character development is pretty nonexistant, and the audience finds itself repeatedly asking itself ""why the hell did he do THAT???""

  Having said all that, the movie remains one of my favorite guilty pleasures. It is, to be sure, not a great film, but it remains a good movie. The action is relentless, the pacing good, and once you get past the cookie-cutter nature of the characters, the character interaction is entertaining. The most likeable figure in the movie is the one-armed cajun, who finally breaks into English, and tells Boothe to do what the audience has been shouting at the screen for three-quarters of the movie.

As much as for any other reason, the movie is well worth the ride for the slinky, swampwater soundtrack, provided very admirably by Ry Cooder (using, among other things, a seven foot long steel guitar.) It is another example of the inexplicable nature of Hollywood that this, of all cooder's soundtracks, has never been released as an album-- go figure!

876209,5,6304435878,"Whatver I say about this film, I can't admit to being objective about it because I adore it so much.  At this point, I have probably watched it about 15 times over the years so I feel something of an expert on it.
Since others have written some very well written reviews of ""Southern Comfort"" I don't want to repeat what they say however a few points require clarification.
First, what this film is about.  It is not, in my opinion, merely about the traditional urban/rural divide. That divide exists in the film as it does in real life.  But that is not the point of the film.  Nor is it an anti-white or anti-Southern screed.  Although it takes place in the South it could take place just about anywhere when one realizes what the film is really about. Also both the ""survivors"" and the ""villains"" in the film are white Southerners.  The ""survivors"" being two Lousiana National Guardsman - Spencer (Kieth Carradine) and Hardin (Powers Boothe).  The ""villains"" being Cajun fisherman/hunters out in the swamps of Lousiana.
No, what ""Southern Comfort"" is really about is what happens when arrogant fools invade another people's land and start indulging in violent and hostile acts, including destroying the livelihood of the indigeneous native people (e.g. cutting their fishing nets and stealing their boats), shooting at, seizing, and taking prisoner innocent locals, blowing up their homes, abusing and torturing them (sounds all to familiar), and then wondering why they are hated so much and why the native people attack them.  The message is really that simple.
It was captured in a short dialogue after the ""survivors"" are shown to be the last two left among the guardsmen.  When they are confronted by a shotgun toting one armed Cajun (who was previously their prisoner) brilliantly played by the late Brion James, Hardin asks the Cajun, ""Do you mind telling us what this [the war with the guardsmen] is all about?""  The Cajun responds, ""It's real simple. This is our land. We live back here and no one f***s with us here."" For that reason the advertising slogan for the film - ""The Land of Hospitality...unless you don't belong"" - is wrong.  It should have read ""The Land of Hospitality...unless you misbehave and start mistreating and abusing the locals!""
If the guardsman hadn't behaved badly then they would not have had much trouble with the locals in the first place. Also, the Cajuns in the small town at the end of the film came across as quite normal and hospitable to me.  Only the ""swamp rat"" Cajuns come across as threatening and THEY were only fighting back against violent intruders.  So I have to disagree with the assessment by some that the film is anti-Cajun, anti-white, or anti-Southern.  On the contrary, one of the ""heroes"" (i.e., survivors) is a white Southerner from Baton Rouge (Spencer played by Keith Carradine).  As for the Cajuns shown in the small town, they were not actors. They were real people that were shown honestly and fairly - enjoying good food, good company, good music, and dancing.
To sum up, ""Southern Comfort"" is an outstanding and extraordinary film in its own right. The acting is persuasive and very convincing, especially from Fred Ward who plays a very menancing type and, of course, the much underrated and underappreciated Powers Boothe who plays the ""outsider"" from El Paso, Texas.  The direction by Walter Hill is superb. The cinematography from the first frame to the last by Andrew Laszlo is lush, rich, and luxuriant. (It makes me want to visit the Lousiana bayou to see it for myself.)  And last, but not least, the music composed and arranged (and played) by Ry Cooder is both mysterious and seductive.  Few films have ever enjoyed such a perfect marriage between image and music as ""Southern Comfort.""  The only other film that has this quality that immediately comes to mind is Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" which featured the hypnotically beautiful zither music by Anton Karas.  Karas and Cooder both share an indescribable special quality that is evident in both films.
The DVD transfer is outstanding. The only disappointment is the lack of any meaningful extras.  Other than the original trailer there is nothing else.  Okay, this is a budget priced DVD but still this film deserves better. I hope that MGM will see the light and re-release ""Southern Comfort"" with some useful extras like filmographies/biographies, behind the scenes photos, a ""making of"" documentary, and especially an expert commentary.  This film definitely deserves it. Halliwell's Film Guide gives it four stars and if you know anything about Halliwell's you know how difficult it is for any film to get four stars.
So on a scale of one to five stars, I give the film five stars but the DVD four stars.  Nevertheless because I love this film so much and wish it had a larger audience I will rate it five stars for Amazon.",1085529600,27,4864,4.846618357487923
876286,4,6304435878,"Walter Hill's 1981 film ""Southern Comfort"" slightly resembles other ""hillbillies gone wild"" type films like ""Deliverance"" and H.G. Lewis's ""2000 Maniacs."" Hill's filmography contains a few memorable films (""The Warriors, ""48 Hours"") and even more forgettable pictures (""Extreme Prejudice,"" ""Red Heat""). Considering the man's body of work, I am willing to wager that ""Southern Comfort"" is his best film, an effort where nearly everything gels into a magnificent whole. Technically, the film is wonderfully brilliant, filled with compelling and well-developed characters, tremendous scenery and ominous atmosphere, menacing villains, and an incredible music score from Ry Cooder. Notice, however, that I said ""nearly everything."" I have serious problems with several of the philosophical tenets that lay over every part of the picture like a wet blanket. Perhaps some of the issues I had with Hill's project weren't as apparent in 1981 as they are now. Whatever the case, ""Southern Comfort"" is a racist film loaded with sectionalism, irrational fears, and scurrilous stereotyping. ""If your claims are true,"" you might ask, ""why have I not heard about this film before?"" Good question. The answer, if you want one, concerns racism directed against whites.
The plot is deceptively simple. Set in the watery recesses of the Louisiana bayous, ""Southern Comfort"" tells the tale of a squad of National Guardsmen who encounter way more than they imagined after running into a trio of Cajuns during a routine training mission. When the guardsmen realize they are lost in the swamps, they decide to steal some poachers' canoes they find on a riverbank. Big mistake. As the weekend warriors float away, they notice the Cajuns watching them from the shoreline. One of the dunces in the outfit rattles off a burst of blanks from his machine gun as a sort of joke. The Cajuns don't know the gun isn't real, and one of them promptly plants a bullet into the head of the squad leader (Peter Coyote in one of his shortest film roles) from an amazing distance. The soldiers, horribly surprised by such a bloody incident, make it to shore and begin worrying about how to get out of the bayou. The compass, the radio, and the only map went down with the canoes, thus effectively trapping the men behind enemy lines. The Cajuns track the soldiers down and dispatch them with dogs, traps, falling trees, and gunfire. As the squad rapidly dwindles, the only hope is to keep going and find a way out. Hindering the quest for civilization are tensions within the group between two city boys (Powers Boothe and Keith Carradine) and two rednecks (Fred Ward and Lewis Smith).
""Southern Comfort"" is an enjoyable film in many respects. The excellent cast takes most of the credit for the success of the film. Powers Boothe-great as always-plays main character Charles Hardin, a soldier who recently transferred into the Louisiana Guard from Texas. He's a city boy who despises rednecks, hates the South, and has a hard time accepting the behavior he sees from some of his squad mates. Keith Carradine plays a Louisiana city boy, Spencer, who befriends Hardin even as he feels pressure from his fellow soldiers to conform. The best performance in the film comes from Fred Ward. Ward plays sinister redneck soldier Lonnie Reece, a man who readily takes to violence in any situation. He's the one who brought along a box of live ammo, who tortures a Cajun captive, and who opposes Hardin. You'll recognize several other actors in the film, including Brion James as a Cajun, Franklyn Seales and T.K. Carter as guardsmen, and Alan Autry as the unstable Corporal ""Coach"" Bowden. The cast makes the movie, and ultimately saves it considering the overtones of racism and hatred in the script.
The film's prejudice against poor white southerners becomes apparent very quickly. The bad guys in the film are always rural types like Lonnie Reece or the Cajuns. Moreover, the film presents these characters as dangerously unbalanced types prone to fits of irrational violence (Reece's threats with his gun and knife, Bowden's firebombing of the Cajun trapper's home) or bouts of mental instability (Bowden's retreat into insanity). There certainly isn't any sympathy for the Cajuns in any part of the film. ""Southern Comfort"" presents them as filthy savages barely capable of speaking. Sure, these swamp dwellers started killing the soldiers, but they only did so after the squad stole their boats and one idiot opened up on them with a machine gun full of blanks. In fact, the guy who fired the blanks in jest is of course one of the rural rednecks in the outfit. At the end of the film, Hardin and Spencer end up in a Cajun town out in the boonies. The fear on Hardin's face underscores the fear urban dwellers should always have when confronted with a group of ""dumb hicks"" out in the sticks. Heck, these folks don't even have a phone! What rural stereotypes! On the other hand, the city boy Hardin-and to a lesser extent Spencer-always come across as saner, more sure of themselves, and knowledgeable. So not only do we see anti-white racism, we also get the old urban-rural sectionalism that has defined the development of the United States since its inception.
I'm still going to give the movie a good grade if for no other reason than its opulent cinematography, the wonderful performances, and that great Cajun music at the end of the film. I just didn't care for the pro-urban, hate the rurals propaganda. As though cities are safer and cleaner! Thanks once again go to MGM for releasing a DVD without any extras. All you get here is a widescreen transfer and a trailer. I recommend ""Southern Comfort"" wholeheartedly as long as you recognize the film for what it truly is: an intriguing story infused with questionable philosophical beliefs.

876288,4,6304435878,"This is one of those flicks where even though you may know what's gonna happen, it still has your belly all wound up real tight with tension, simply because you just don't know when or how it's gonna happen.  It's a very formulaic movie with the stereotypical characters, yet that is quickly overlooked as the director does a nice job with the element of surprise and realism.
The movie is essentially about a bunch of wanna-be National Guards sent out on a routine weekend mission in the swamps of Louisiana, only to find themselves at war with some mean locals.  When water appears where land should be, the troop has no choice but to borrow some unattended boats belonging to some Cajun locals.  Of course, things go awry when the troop member, plagued with idiocy, shoots a round of blanks at the locals for sheer fun.  Things heat up real fast as the wanna-be guards begin the fight for survival in an unknown territory with only blanks.  Some scenes get you so riled up, you'll be at the edge of your seat shouting ""what the . . . !""  Unfortunately, the captain and another member sometimes come across as poor actors, but depending on how you see it, that could be explained as an approach to portray realistic men who just don't know what the heck they're doing.  Afterall, from the beginning, the Sergeant pleads with them to act like real soldiers for once in their life.
The film seems to work best as a ""survival of the fittest"" story instead of a macho-type, action-packed war movie.  The eerie swamp certainly contributes to many nerve-racking moments.  Slightly puzzling ending, but still a relatively good film.  Certainly above standard.",1067731200,2,1654,4.711805555555555
876289,5,6304435878,"This tautly-told tale of the explosive mix of subcultures under extreme conditions is a gem seldom discussed in movie circles, but is indeed a near-cult favorite of Vietnam vets who recognize the allegorical message of its gritty and ironic twists of plot associated with the casual and almost nonchalant attitudes of several Louisiana National Guard reservists off on a weekend military exercise during the early 1970s in the foreboding and eerie bayou country. Famed action director Walter Hill wastes little time in setting the dilemma into motion, and by disobeying orders and ""improvising"" a way across a large river by ""borrowing"" some Cajun moon-shiners' boats, the squad soon finds itself engaged in escalating misunderstanding and quite plausible sequences of violence, murder, and mayhem.
For anyone ever in the military of that era, it is a profoundly accurate depiction of just how easily disorganized, untrained, and undisciplined troops who are poorly indoctrinated and even more poorly led can find itself disastrously out of control under circumstances they can no longer positively influence. Moreover, left to their own devices,and slowly decimated through casualties inflicted by their erstwile opponents, they unnecessarily and fatefully add to their own predicament by taking action that makes their predicament much worse. They also find, to their horror, that relatively untrained civilians with guns and attitude can be formidable opponents. The stealth, familiarity with the terrain, and downright viciousness employed by the local Cajun moon-shiners makes this a captivating study in how slender are the threads that binds us together in a large and pluralistic society such as ours. Speaking of terrain, the way in which Hill uses the topography and atmosphere of the swamps and savannas of the bayou make it an essential and unpredictable aspect to their efforts to extricate themselves from this background of madness.
In what is perhaps the best-delivered performance of his many-faceted career, Powers Boothe provides a rational coda to the irrational aggression swirling around him as Hardin, a white collared and college educated trooper who has only recently joined the unit, and whose efforts to corral the others that he characterizes as rednecks, into a more cohesive fighting force finally work to their advantage. Fred Ward is also excellent here, as is Keith Carradine, Peter Coyote, and Alan Autry, who later gained fame as the resident stud-muffin southern boy featured in the TV series version of ""Heat Of The Night"". Also an essential ingredient in delivering a movie with a knockout punch is Ry Cooder's haunting score, which provides a wonderful mix of southern twang and Cajun chords in accompanying this extremely well told tale. For anyone interested in an allegorical approach to our Vietnam troubles told interestingly and provocatively, I can highly recommend the movie, and am glad it is finally out in DVD. Enjoy!",1065225600,64,2967,5.382795698924731
876290,5,6304435878,"This is a relatively short film (105 minutes) which is tightly organized and brilliantly directed by Walter Hill who co-authored the screenplay with producer David Giler. It focuses on nine members of the Louisiana National Guard who, during a field training session in 1973, find themselves in armed conflict with swamp residents whom the ""weekend warriors"" have provoked. Almost immediately, it becomes obvious that the Guardsmen lack the leadership, experience, and weapons they need so they begin an escape journey through totally unfamiliar and naturally perilous territory, pursued by the wily and hostile Cajuns. In certain respects, the swamp becomes the main character. The Guardsmen's fear is intensified by the fact that their maps are useless. They have no idea where they are, much less in which direction to proceed. As they slog along, they are picked off one at a time. Eventually....
The acting is generally first-rate. Powers Boothe (Hardin) and Fred Ward (Reece) are especially noteworthy, with Boothe portraying someone who is solid, sensible, practical, and mature in sharp contrast to Ward's character whose attitude and behavior suggest a potentially dangerous psychosis. Keith Carradine (Spencer) is less impressive, perhaps because his character throughout much of the film seems so laid-back, indifferent, almost aloof. Peter Coyote (Poole) makes a brief but memorable appearance. Others in the cast are OK. Special mention should be made of Ry Cooder's musical score which is most impressive when integrated with festive activities in a Cajun village. The tone of the celebration is juxtaposed in stunning contrast with the terror which has consumed the reservists.
Frankly, I am unable to explain why, when I inquire, so few of my countless ""film buff"" friends have even heard of this film, much less seen it. Those who then act on my strong recommendation and see it tell me later how much they enjoyed it. Veterans of the Viet Nam War indicate that it reminds them of their own experiences with the Viet Cong. Some of the veterans compare this film with Platoon.

876292,4,6304435878,"Nine National Guardsmen on a routine weekend training mission suddenly find themselves out of their depth when they come into conflict with a group of Cajun hunters. What begins as a misconceived practical joke (Stucky, played by character actor Lewis Smith shoots blanks at them from the boats they've ""borrowed"" from them to get across a flooded trail), escalates into a full blown war between the two groups. The Cajuns begin hunting the soliders who are armed only with blanks and one round of real bullets.

Walter Hill's taunt direction and script (based on Michael Kane's original script and rewritten with long time collaborator David Giler)bring this backwoods Apocalypse Now to life. While it integrates elements of Delieverence, Apocalypse Now and a number of 50's b-movie aspects into its clever script, Southern Comfort is far from derivative due to the direction, photography and strong acting.

Powers Boothe and Fred Ward (in an early major role)virtually steal the movie from star Keith Carradine. Boothe a surpremely talented underused performer, shines in his role as Hardin the recent Texas transplant. The cast of character actors features strong performances from Peter Coyote (in a pre-E.T. performance) and Brion James (Blade Runner)as well. The interaction of these bickering weekend warriors makes the picture come to life. The setting makes this all the more believable as many males of adult age chose the National Guard to the alternative of serving in Vietnam (the film is set in 1973).

The transfer is very good. There's not a lot of analog artifacts and there's little of the compression problems that one has come to expect from budget priced DVDs. While the film is given a bare bones (it's a companion to MGM's Midnite Movie series)presentation with only foreign language tracks, subtitles and the original trailer, it is presented in its original aspect ratio. The sound is quite good as well and is true to its original stereo soundtrack.

876386,5,6304435878,"SOUTHERN COMFORT is one of Walter Hill's best films. Set in the Louisiana bayous of 1973 a group of National Guardsmen tangle with local Cajuns who systematically hunt them down. I suppose this is all meant to be symbolic of America's foray into Vietnam but these Guardsmen are depicted as an undisciplined group of the most obnoxious and unsympathetic screen incarnations of stupidity I have ever seen. Screenwriters David Giler, Michael Kane and Walter Hill provide no insight into the motivations of the Guardsmen or their Cajun pursuers. Instead of being concerned about the characters from a human-interest perspective the viewer develops a prurient concern in just exactly how they will meet their demise. I ordinarily like Walter Hill's films for their sheer visual energy, which he usually backs up with an equal dose of visual character development. I think that Hill is one of our most underrated directors but SOUTHERN COMFORT looks more like an experiment into allegorical territory of political events that went terribly wrong. Oddly this film looks more akin to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and that is the only saving grace that SOUTHERN COMFORT can muster. As the Guardsmen become disoriented and lost into the bleakness of the bayous the whole film takes on an aura of paranoia, fear and despair. The images created seem like they come from the darkest regions of the psyche. Also very odd is how effectively these disturbing images were created. However, this visual aura becomes equally undone by the shallowness of the central characters as was the case with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the viewer is left with style and no substance.",1013990400,,1649,5.043956043956044

876393,5,6304435878,"'Southern Comfort' is frequently viewed as being an allegory to the Vietnam War.  This is not entirely true.
Although there are references to Vietnam in the film and the stock squad-of-grunts-patrolling-the-jungle motif, in reality the film touches two essential elements of the Anglo-American psyche, beliefs that are rooted all the way back in Colonial days.
The first belief is in the American citizen-soldier, the 'minute-man' who (unlike mercenary professional soldiers) bears arms and submits to military discipline only because he believes in God and Country, and is willing to drop his plow and bear arms to defend his family and property.
The second is the old Puritan hatred of North America's vast wilderness areas, the deep-seated idea that the dark woods must be the abode of Satan, and therefore the forests and anyone living in them is evil.
So you take a squad of these good old-fashioned National Guardsmen, put them in the primeval Lousiana bayou on a training exercise and watch what develops.
Although it is easy to draw parrallels with Vietnam in 'Southern Comfort,' (in fact, when I first saw it on t.v. several years ago I came in halfway and first thought it was in Vietnam), I find it is a much more disturbing film if the viewer keeps in mind that it is set in (relatively) modern day America and questions the validity of our nation's perception of itself, independent of any foriegn influences.",992044800,,1422,4.974789915966387
