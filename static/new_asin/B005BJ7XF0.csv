4643786,4,B005BJ7XF0,"Could have used some BluRay high def action, but oh well. Lots of camera angles, great set and of course the cube is a face-melter. If you haven't seen DeadMau5 live, or you want a memento from the 2010 tour, get this. And if you like dance music and want to scoop on all the bangin tracks, follow effin kenney on twitter.",1315785600,,322,4.209677419354839
4643787,5,B005BJ7XF0,"Deadmau5 is the god of all electronic artists! this dvd kicks ass, even with the editing problems. I just went to a deadmau5 show last night and it was absolutely incredible. This is a must buy dvd that if you don't get, you must be a hater.",1314403200,,241,4.148936170212766
4643788,3,B005BJ7XF0,"This DVD was disappointing.  I have followed Deadmau5 and his music and seen him numerous times, but this DVD does him no justice. I gave this 3 stars solely because it's still a fantastic show, and for that 'touch-screen' Arguru sequence which i had never seen. The audio quality is borderline terrible. I love live music and own several concerts on DVD and BluRay. Deadmau5 is probably my favorite DJ at the moment, but this DVD will never compare to Tiestos: live @ Cophgn. The editing in this DVD was almost annoying, with random cuts, way too much audience footage (not to mention SAME random people), and the interview was dull. I cant say 'i hate it', but i wouldn't pay more than ..$10 for it (shipping included).  Sorry Mau5, better luck next time.  I still catch your shows! <3",1313971200,6,787,4.607142857142857
4643789,3,B005BJ7XF0,"This was an epic performance by Deadmau5, as you can expect.  All of the tracks performed were amazing, with epic visuals.  You can't expect anything less.  Having said that, whoever the hell cut and edited the video's must have been a newbie.  I was dizzy just from the damn intro!  It cuts from one camera angle to the next, to the next, to the next, to the next within seconds of each other.  It almost ruined it for me.  This is the reason why I give 3/5 stars.

Oh, one more thing, the extra interview was stupid (Nothing against deadmau5 of coars!).",1313452800,8,555,4.372549019607843
8463992,5,B005BJ7XF0,"One of my most favorite DVD's.  The energy and drive are high energy and the video-light show is hypnotic...  If you dig Deadmau5, get this!",1439164800,,140,4.56
8463993,5,B005BJ7XF0,I dare any of you who talk crap about this dvd to give it another watch while high - specifically right before the needs a ladder part. Maybe take a huff of duster right before that. You will see some crazy s***. Seriously.,1423612800,,223,4.209302325581396
8463994,5,B005BJ7XF0,This was a gift for my boyfriend.  He loved it.  He loves Deadmau5 so this was the perfect gift for him.,1393718400,,104,3.9047619047619047
8463995,5,B005BJ7XF0,my son loved it asked for it for Christmas and was glad to purchase it for him.  nice to purchase here,1358121600,,102,3.857142857142857
8463996,5,B005BJ7XF0,"Deadmau5 puts on a fantastic performance, with a great playlist and new technology.  He even fixes a WIndows Error and gets a backup computer up and running (a great feat under presssure)!  I think for these reasons it gets a 5-star ranking.",1356307200,,241,4.714285714285714
8463997,5,B005BJ7XF0,AFTER WATCHING THE MEOWINGTON HAX VID I HAD TO GET EARLS COURT THE LIGHT SHOW AND MUSIC IS KILLER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE OF THIS,1352073600,,132,3.925925925925926
8463998,4,B005BJ7XF0,"The audio quality sounds NOTHING like the original songs. The pitch is down lower than it should be. If you rip ""Right this Second"" from the bonus footage, you can manually change the pitch to fit the 128 bpm mark. Not a big problem, but it really should not be here.

  Many people think that the guys filming should pay more attention to the performance than the crowd, and they do have a point. But I think 1 or 2 glances at the crowd is fine. Other than that, it's a good buy.

4/5.",1335052800,,486,4.138297872340425
8463999,2,B005BJ7XF0,"It's as simple as this, if you like Deadmau5 - you will have a hard time finding your money's worth in this DVD. All the songs are pitched down. Period.
It's hard to enjoy a DVD of an artist you enjoy when said artist's songs aren't represented accurately. This entire DVD sounds like someone's pitched down the songs on youtube to avoid copyright infringement.

Furthermore, the camerawork can't be criticized enough. It seems like Ultramusic was more interested in trying to show what a great, big party Deadmau5 shows are - ignoring the beautiful lightshow in favor of a bunch of random dudes. During the opening song, THEY DON'T EVEN SHOW FOOTAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE YOU ARE LISTENING TO. They show a montage of footage from OTHER SONGS. Which is just, infuriating; especially so because most of this montage is still just concert attendees and not Deadmau5 himself.

Before you buy this DVD - know that the songs you know and love are not in their intended pitches - and that the beautiful lightshow you come to expect from a Mau5 show plays sidekick to footage of a bunch of British dudes standing around watching Deadmau5 off-camera.",1323907200,3,1139,4.776649746192893
8464000,2,B005BJ7XF0,"I love Deadmau5.  I think he's one of the greatest artists on the planet right now, and was hoping that this DVD would successfully convey the spirit of Deadmau5 live.

The DVD is a huge failure.  The main reason is the camerawork.  I am honestly not sure if the cameraman/men knew that they were filming a live concert.  It's ridiculous, literally (I mean literally) 90% of the footage consists of random shots of the crowd doing absolutely nothing.  There are times when you just want to yell at the DVD to show the stage, it's insane.

The DVD doesn't convey what Deadmau5 is like live, but it is indeed hard to express something like that through video, so that's kind of a given.  The audio sounds fine, but not as amazing as it is live of course.

The timelapse was the only thing on the DVD I found interesting.  Don't waste your money, I would say.

I love you Deadmau5, but your DVD sucks.",1318636800,2,898,4.414634146341464
8464001,2,B005BJ7XF0,The music is great but the video editing is terrible to say the least.  I bought this DVD as I have been unable to make a live show. The editing makes it hard to appreciate the amazing visuals and stage show. For half the intro the camera is panning around the crowd instead of showing the stage/screen. You are better off just downloading the music from beat port or buying the 4X4=12 CD and watching youtube  clips. Hopefully he releases an HD version of the Meowington Haxs tour but has a different editor.,1316044800,,509,4.462365591397849
