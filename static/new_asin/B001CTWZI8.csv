8289216,5,B001CTWZI8,The Christmas story is the best story ever written.  This animation will give just a little different twist on the story.  I could not take my eyes away from the screen and have watched this numerous time.,1238025600,,205,4.513513513513513
8289217,4,B001CTWZI8,Somtimes money and riches can become all consuming when we forget about the real meaning of Christmas. A gift a babe born in a manger. Some parts are intense for 4 and under. The movie held the kids attention and at some points went overboard with drama. All and all it has a life lesson and we need all the help we can get now a days with our kids where violence is all around.,1223078400,,378,4.053333333333334
