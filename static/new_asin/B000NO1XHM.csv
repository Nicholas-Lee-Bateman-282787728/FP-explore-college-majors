8180239,4,B000NO1XHM,"This program is a very competent look at the development of biological weapons from WWI through the entry into force of the Bio Weapons Convention in the mid-1970""s.  It is also a chilling education in the dangers of weaponizing biological agents.
It does not deal with chemical weapons, except in passing, and it does not speak to more recent bio scares, such as the 2001 anthrax mailings, or the implications of bio warfare in an age of asymmetrical warfare.",1391990400,,460,4.822784810126582
