8358046,1,B0029OL13K,"Not at all happy with it for the cost.  It is too much like another one he already had out, so I had already seen and paid for most of the same show.  Not worth the money. He needs some new material.",1470268800,,199,3.7142857142857144

8358052,2,B0029OL13K,"The grand kids and I watched today for the first time  and it was a "" major disappointment""  This video is  47 minutes of heavily edited material from what I am guessing was one of his first shows on the strip.  It was taken with only two camera's and both  the sound and picture quality were noticeably lacking.  This never would have made it onto network TV because of the obvious poor quality.  I would bet that copies of his appearances on America's Got Talent would have been head and shoulders better.
I noticed some folks gave this almost rave reviews and five stars..  So please take this review as just one opinion.",1421280000,2,624,4.460176991150442
