4270795,5,B0046MVVTM,"This review is for the Bluray release of McHale's Navy: The Movies (2014) from Madman, an Australian import (Region 4) which is playable on some later model Region 1 players.  Perhaps it is an error, but Amazon indicates that this release is a Region 2 Bluray, which is not playable on a Region 1 player.

Based on the TV comedy McHale's Navy (1962-66), the two films on the disc are McHale's Navy (1964), and McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force (1965).  While the TV series was produced in black and white for its entire four season run, these movies are in color, and look quite stunning by comparison, as a fabulous job of restoration has been done.  The transfers are anamorphic, and in high definition, the colors are rich and saturated, with a high level of sharpness.  Those accustomed to the rather flat images found of the Shout Factory DVD releases, are in for a very pleasant surprise.

Released in 1964, McHale's Navy features Ernest Borgnine (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poseidon-Adventure/dp/B007RFJCN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poseidon Adventure</a>), Tim Conway (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Carol-Burnett-Show/dp/B009I23DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Carol Burnett Show</a>), Joe Flynn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Million-Dollar-Duck/dp/B00077BPGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Million Dollar Duck</a>), and most of the primary cast members from the series.  Set in the south Pacific, the crew of PT-73 find themselves massively in debt, after suffering a major loss in a gambling scheme.  To settle the debt, Commander McHale (Borgnine) considers marriage to a local businesswoman.  Winning a horserace becomes an option, but that won't be easy, as a suspicious Captain Binghamton (Flynn) is always watching.

Busy filming&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flight-of-the-Phoenix/dp/B00008MTVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flight of the Phoenix</a>, Ernest Borgnine was unable to appear in McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force.  In McHale's absence, the crew of PT-73 get involved with the Russian navy, and Ensign Parker (Conway) is mistaken for an Air Force general's son.  Captain Binghamton and Lt. Carpenter (Bob Hastings), are also caught up in the deception.  The film is highlighted by memorable scenes featuring Parker and Binghamton trapped in a flight trainer, and later in a jeep, hanging from an Air Force cargo plane in flight.  Most of the primary cast returns, although their roles are greatly reduced, and the film also features Jean Hale (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Like-Flint/dp/B000067J15/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Like Flint</a>), Susan Silo, and Ted Bessell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-Girl/dp/B000EQ5PTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That Girl</a>).

While featuring great new video transfers, the bonus features are a little sparse, with each film featuring a photo gallery of stills and promotional materials, and an isolated soundtrack featuring the music of composer Jerry Fielding (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mechanic/dp/B001CDG64I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mechanic</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bring-Me-the-Head-of-Alfredo-Garcia/dp/B001CBEV38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</a>), who scored both films.  Some of Fielding's themes, would also be used for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogan-s-Heroes/dp/B002L9N4O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogan's Heroes</a>.

Although it could have been improved, this release still deserves high marks for the superior quality high definition transfers, and for providing value to the fans, by including both films in a single release, instead of issuing them separately.",1411344000,,4015,7.194672131147541

8417382,5,B0046MVVTM,"I had purchased the 2 McHale's Navy movies from Amazon a few years ago when the were released on Shout. The video & audio remastering  of the negatives are excellent, in my opinion. I've always wanted them to be released on the Blu-ray format, so I e-mailed Universal/MCA  a couple of times and they replied no, it wasn't the time.
Also, I like to say that I have a Samsung Blu-Ray player from 2012, and ordered the Blu-ray  import version to see if it plays, to my surprise, it does. On the back of the case, it mentions Region, A, B, C. Thank you  Mad Man",1509148800,,557,4.226415094339623
8417383,4,B0046MVVTM,Isnt this just wonderful another american series that cant be played in the united states these video companies make me sick. Now its region free its about time.,1467158400,,161,4.785714285714286
8417384,5,B0046MVVTM,"A magnificent set that really makes me appreciate McHale's Navy in Technicolor. It's too bad the 1962-66 abc series didn't have it's 4th (1965-66) season in color (the season when many programs on all 3 American networks switched to color). Sequel McHale's Navy Joins The Air Force (1965) is just as good as McHale's Navy (1964) , though McHale and Gruber were absent. The rest of the crew (including Happy Haines a year after he left the series) and other cast members, rise to the occaision. You can't go wrong with this double-header of adventurous hilarity.",1465084800,,561,4.854166666666667

8417387,5,B0046MVVTM,"These two movies continue on the hijinks of McHale and his crew. I saw them both at the theatre as a kid and wasn't disappointed then or the blue rays today. The second movie - McHale's Navy Joins the Airforce - doesn't include Borgnine, but is still a winner with Tim Conway and Joe Flynn carrying the comedy to great heights. What a comedy team they would have made.",1434931200,,368,4.3478260869565215

8417389,5,B0046MVVTM,"I'd been looking for ""McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force"" for a long time, and had only seen very expensive VHS tapes. I did have a DVD of the first movie, which can be ordered as a made-on-demand title where they burn your copy when you order it. This was actually more than I was expecting:
-This is an Australian disc, it has only been officially released there (and based on the fine print, New Zealand too).
-To clear up any confusion, the back lists regions A, B, and C, which should mean it will work in any player. Because they are 1080p/24 transfers, it is a universal video standard and PAL/NTSC won't be a problem. Works great in my Region A player in the US.
-Solid HD transfers, especially considering that these are rather niche titles. I've seen better, but still leaps and bounds above DVD. Better than I expected, especially with both on the same disc.
-Audio for each title is uncompressed PCM stereo sound. While these aren't major audio presentations, and a Dolby Digital track would have probably sounded fine, it is still nice to see uncompressed audio when possible.
-Both films give you the option to listen to an isolated score/effects track. These tracks are compressed using Dolby Digital. I don't see much of a point here. Isolated score would be one thing, to just hear the music, but the fact that it includes the sound effects just turns it into the same as muting the dialogue. Still it was nice of them to include any extra that they had on hand, and is more effort than even many bigger releases get.
-It includes a booklet with a couple of pages on each film, discussing Borgnine's absence from the second one etc. I really get the feeling that this was put out by people who cared, not just something they got the rights to really cheap and slapped on a disc, which is what I would have thought this would be.

I really love the show, and the movies are great. The first one has more character driven comedy, though the second one (without Borgnine) is my favorite of the two. My favorite parts of the show were the quarrels between Captain Binghamton and Ensign Parker. The second movie is chock full of that. The first has more story to it etc, and many would say it was the better of the two. It is interesting to see the crew in color (and not the badly colorized episodes of the show), and getting used to the comedy without the laugh track takes a few minutes if you're used to the show. It is funny how I can tune out the laugh track and find it annoying when I do notice it, but when it is gone, things feel weird all the same.

If you're a fan of the show, I'd say grab this while you can!",1421020800,4,2633,4.371428571428571
