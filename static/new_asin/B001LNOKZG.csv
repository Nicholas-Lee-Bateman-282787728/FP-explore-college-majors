this video to be quite profound.  The video doesn't take sides one way or another.  It was refreshing to view an event, which had a major impact on my life, that wasn't underlined by the Vietnam antiwar sentiments that were so popular in 1968.  It revealed the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the fighting spirit on both sides.
Personally I find war to be a senseless waste of youth and a negative use of a nation's resources.  A true warrior will always seek a peaceful solution to war if the option is provided.  Yet this same warrior will fight for what he feels his nation believes in.  I believe this spirit of the North Vietnamese Army and the United States was openly displayed in this video.
Lastly, I feel you had to be there to fully appreciate the message of this video.  I am not proclaiming to be a ""war monger"", but I did my duty as an American United States Marine.  I could have run away like many of my friends did to avoid this conflict.  I didn't always agree with some of the policies we were ordered to follow yet one can do his/her duty as an American or United States Marine and still be proud of it.",1273449600,6,1213,4.239130434782608
