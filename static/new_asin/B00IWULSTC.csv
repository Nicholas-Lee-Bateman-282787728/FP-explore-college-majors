6300496,3,B00IWULSTC,"For starters, it's a little too early to judge this kind of really different (On broadcast tv) thing. My first instinct on watching the first one was that the content was kinda shabby, seeing cartoons on a science show. Probably because of one of the cartoonistic producers. Of course none of these folks are anything close to Carl Sagan. Anyway considering commercial television it's better than nothing. But it's too early to tell. Could go one way or the other. Why didn't they do it on a network more exprienced with science progamming. YEA it's the cartoons, the original didn't need them, they had at least a reality to point to.",1395792000,24,635,4.72972972972973
6300497,3,B00IWULSTC,"The continuity and content in this series so far is real simple and goes into little depth.  Lots of cute animation and a ""Disneyesque"" lines for the characters!  Certainly, it serves as a good general introduction to some basic questions in physics and astronomy, but the treatment is very elementary and presents no particular challenge to anyone with a solid undergraduate liberal arts education at the college level.  Very good, however, for middle school.  I say ""so far""; maybe the situation will improve.",1395532800,30,511,5.120481927710843

6300506,5,B00IWULSTC,"Neil de Grasse Tyson is the man. We love him. If he was doing videos on how to sing the alphabet song, or how to tie your shoes, or how turn on a light switch, we'd still watch him !!! But, lucky for us, he made an incredibly easy-to-follow ""movie"" on physics, chemistry, astronomy, with modern visual effects. ""Cosmos"" touches a bit on so many aspects of astronomy, and science, that we can then jump off, on our own, and study the bits that we are extra curious about. He is a great speaker, presenter, and role model.

""Cosmos"" should be in every school; pre, elementary, middle, and high school. Science is for everyone; science is not only for scientists.

We would like to give more than 5 stars. Six stars. Seven stars. A million stars. A nebula. 5 nebulas. 100 nebulas. Neil, how many nebulas are there?",1520899200,,811,4.472972972972973

6300508,5,B00IWULSTC,"I stumbled onto this series several days ago and I am so happy that I did. This is one if not the most brilliant and visually stunning productions about time, space and the universe I've have ever seen in my life. Neil Degrasse Tyson takes us on a fascinating journey about the universe and how every living being on this planet came to be. I'm currently on episode 4 which has me enthralled and hypnotized as Neil transports us through the far reaches of the universe in the ship of imagination. The visualizations are so captivating and stunning I cant take my eyes away from the screen for one second. Neil's explanation of complex scientific jargon in layman's terms leaves the viewer with a solid grasp and understanding of scientific phenomena. This series should be required viewing for every science class in America in my opinion.",1520812800,,839,4.7534246575342465
6300509,5,B00IWULSTC,"The discs come in a plastic snap case. They play fine.

The series is terrific. Cosmos (2014) with Neil deGrasse Tyson builds on the original Cosmos (1980) with Carl Sagan. Ive seen Neil Tyson in other shows and hes great.

CAUTION: The discs I bought for the Carl Sagan 1980 Cosmos won't play on U.S. players. I bought the discs on Amazon and there weren't any warnings, saying the discs weren't Region 1. Thats why I gave the original Cosmos three stars on Amazon. I had to play the series on a computer that recognizes all regions.

If you love astronomy I recommend the History channels The Universe (2007-2012) series, which I bought on discs, although the folding cardboard and plastic contraption the discs came in doesnt hold the discs very well.

If you like good space fiction you might like some of the following. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From the Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination. If you like any of these you might also like Manhattan (2014-2015), Granite Flats (2013-2015) or Taken (2002). All three series are set during WWII or shortly after. They are about secret government programs. Manhattan is about making the first atomic bomb, like the movie Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Taken is about UFOs and alien visitors, sort of a fictionalized version of Project Blue Book. And Granite Flats is about the experimental drug program MKUltra (the CIA mind control program).

All of the above series have great story arcs. They start and finish strong and have great middles. One difference is the smoking and drinking. There is smoking and drinking in almost every scene in Manhattan, which was set during the era when soldiers received packs of cigarettes with their meal rations. Ever been around a chain smoker? In Taken theres a scene where Crawford says his doctor prescribed cigarettes for hypertension. Imagine that. I don't remember any smoking in Granite Flats, but that might just be my poor memory.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,3459,5.098939929328622

6300519,1,B00IWULSTC,"My wife and I bought this hoping to get a good scientific look at the marvels and mysteries of the universe. What we actually got in this documentary series was a rather twisted and deranged system of beliefs that were based solely on imagination, not observable or verifiable scientific fact. It was really a system of religion. They had their own version of god, their own creation account (not based on observable or verifiable scientific facts), their own priesthood, their own doctrine (again not based on observable or verifiable scientific facts), their own plan of redemption, and their own form of church discipline and excommunication.

There will always be disagreements about origins in this world, and there is a time and place for discussion about those disagreements. But when people like this pretend to do science while they are actually engaged in indoctrinating people into their own worldview based on mere theory and speculation, it does great harm to both theological discussion and to true science.

I had high hopes, but this was shameful. It went in the trash.",1512172800,3,1085,5.055865921787709

6300527,3,B00IWULSTC,"After finishing the season, Im not sure if the primary purpose was to educate, entertain, or present the historical relationship between religion and science. These are big subjects to tackle, and overall I think the writers tried to jam too much into a 1-season TV series.

Pros:
-The cosmic time calendar was a creative way to help grasp and understand the life of the universe.
-The topics were interesting to learn about.
-Loved the explanation in E12 about the sources of CO2 in our atmosphere (volcanoes vs fossil fuels).
-The visuals were enjoyable.

Cons:
-Slow moving, mixing storyline with scientific subjects. (-1/2 star)
-With research on the multiverse being all the rage now, was expecting to hear more about the topic. (-1/2 star)
-For the ~9hrs of runtime, in my opinion there could have been more info and less fluff. (-1/2 star)
-The producers painted religious history with a broad, negative brush. (-1/2 star)

I knew going in that there would be some atheistic/agnostic partiality, but it was off putting how much it seemed like science was being pitted against religion. As well, there unfortunately seemed to be gaps in understanding of religious beliefs, religious history, and the history of science. Search for Fr. Robert Barron Cosmos for a ~10min video outlining what I mean.

Also, if you're not closed-minded, Why Were Catholic by Trent Horn is a well-written, easy-to-read, comprehensive book summarizing many religious topics and reasons to believe.

Or remain ignorant. And risk winding up in Hell. Forever. ;p

My friends, from personal experience, I understand how alluring the black and white, objective nature of science can be. Science has attracted me as far back as I can remember, and I was agnostic until my mid twenties. But I hope that someday you will come to know that God loves you, that life with God is so much richer, and science also becomes even more wonderful. Ill be praying for you. Please pray for me as well.

6300528,5,B00IWULSTC,"Like his predecessor and mentor Carl Sagan, Tyson does a fantastic job of explaining crucial physics for the modern world. Without laboring the points, he demonstrates how throughout history, the mad pursuit of power destroyed civilizations. The production is superb in every respect! Music, graphics, CGI, editing, incredible camera work... are all excellent. This should be required viewing for every human on the planet, but especially the so-called ""leaders"" who make horrible decisions through their ignorance or blatant corruption.

With continuing insanities of wars and escalating idiocies from the ignorant egotistical orangoutang at 1600, more people MUST see this!
With the demonstrable effects of man-made global warming causing hurricanes, higher sea levels, and even more terrifying CO2 rise, we need a mass of informed people to quell this tide of corporate sponsored ignorance.

This series, like Sagan's, is part of the cure. It's essential viewing, and very plausibly, might be one of the few things that help us survive.",1507766400,3,1039,5.528301886792453

For many years, I've been a fan of the original ""Cosmos"" series with Carl Sagan.  When I bought this version with Neil deGrasse Tyson, I was skeptical that it would measure up.  The very reasonable price tag, however, convinced me to take a chance.  I was not disappointed.  Even though the format was very similar, this new ""Cosmos"" explored new areas of wonder and did so with a flair that made every minute interesting.  Like Sagan's masterpiece, this one was accessible to all viewers, not simply those with expertise in the sciences.

Opening and closing the series in the same settings as the original was also way past pleasing.  Mr. Tyson's pace of speech is thankfully not ""in your face"" fast as so many things are today.  I don't think anyone misses Carl's ""billions and billions"" phrase that he repeated many times in the original.  And the kicker is the pauses Neil injects at the conclusions of a point that gives the viewer time to contemplate what he has said.  There are a lot of changes and updates from the original, reflecting current knowledge of things like Black Holes.

6300576,2,B00IWULSTC,"If you like Christian bashing, this is for you.

I prefer similar programs done by Professor Brian Cox.  An enjoyable aspect of Professor Brian Cox is that he stays on subject.  No politics, and no criticizing people of faith. I have no idea about his politics or religion. These are always the best teachers.

If you are an atheist you will probably enjoy this Cosmos presentation more.",1490313600,,387,4.731343283582089
6300577,5,B00IWULSTC,"Neil Degrasse Tyson delivers.  Explaining things on a laymans level, Tyson presents this topic well.  Many reviewers criticize him and the material for being amateurish, on a childs level.  Perhaps that was the point! To help even youngsters understand and even enjoy learning about Astronomy, its necessary to bring it down from a scholars level.  That said, there is much value even an adult can appreciate.

I also found it to be a fitting tribute to the late Carl Sagan.

That said, this BD (Blu-ray Disc) presentation was very well done. The stunning visuals and rich audio really pop.  Crisp, clear, nearly 3D quality on a flat-screen TV nearly puts you there. Subject matter takes the viewer from the very reaches of the universe to the infinitesimal microscopic life. Each episode is so engrossing and informative; its over before it started.  Tyson takes you on a trip with his Ship of the Imagination. This is one of the few TV shows of this era I found myself eagerly awaiting each weeks episode. It is a shame there were only 13 episodes.

Brannon Braga (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Enterprise, Voyager; Threshold, 24, etc.) directed and was Executive Producer.

Alan Sylvestri  composed the fitting musical score.

The packaging was done well. Discs are available on plastic pages in the typical blue BD case. This makes disc access easy, unlike some which are packaged on a spindle.

If you find Astronomy fascinating, I have no doubt this will be a worthy addition to your collection",1490227200,4,1502,4.8893280632411065

6300607,5,B00IWULSTC,"This remake of the Carl Sagan-fronted classic ""Cosmos"" had some pretty big shoes to fill, and a lot to love up to. Backed by Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane and produced/directed by Star Trek's Brannon Braga, the newest iteration of ""Cosmos"" delivers mightily. Host Neil DeGrasse Tyson has his own personal connection with Sagan, having written to him as a child and spent a day working with him -- an experience that stoked the fires of passion for learning about astronomy and physics which seems to never have left Tyson, even to this day. ""Cosmos"" is quite clearly a labor of love for him, as it is for Sagan's widow Ann Druyan, who has written a number of the episodes herself.

The special effects in Sagan's original series were groundbreaking for their time, but are of course quite dated when compared to what can be accomplished today. Tyson's ""Cosmos"" contains jaw-dropping vistas and panoramas, from the spectacle of galaxies colliding, all the may down to the sub-atomic level. For those with high-definition TVs, the Blu-Ray is a must purchase, as the visuals are nothing short of stunning. But the real heart of the show, just as it has always been, is that sense of wonder which we all feel when looking skyward on a dark, starry night and contemplating our existence and place in the cosmos. Taking a whistle-stop journey from the dawn of creation to the ends of the universe itself, ""Cosmos"" will delight, inspire,and enthrall you. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1482710400,,1483,4.861660079051384

6300651,2,B00IWULSTC,"This is an interesting series, never have I seen an educational documentary with such an obvious bias, it has a thinly-veiled anti-religious agenda. It uses misrepresentation of the facts, shoddy reasoning and half-truths in expressing this agenda. It also comments on political issues and creates a false impression science and religion being at war. Some of the science is solid, but there was a failure to acknowledge the major problems with the Neo-Darwinian paradigm. Comments on the multiverse theory as being a viable possibility (very speculative indeed) This series smacks of plain old propaganda. Only in the US could such a documentary as this be taken seriously, let alone be shown in schools.

That said, when you wade through the excrement and poor fact checking, the series is still visually stunning and Neil DeGrasse-Tyson is a brilliant communicator (or propaganda minister, take your pick).

6300756,3,B00IWULSTC,"I recently watched Car Sagan's Cosmos for the first time. It was staggering in it's brilliance. It talked about ancient history and the wonders of the universe, with amazing insight and respect. It did talk about Evolution, but mostly with a very light touch that someone like me with a great love of science and a deep faith in God could largely acknowledge without taking offense (it was at least clear and well-thought out using the knowledge available at the time). The phrase ""Evolution is not a theory, it is fact."" elicited a roar of laughter due to the ridiculousness of the statement, but I have enough respect for other people's beliefs to acknowledge that other people are entitled to their own religion (and make no mistake, that which cannot be dis-proven in a person's mind, including the Theory of Evolution, is a religion). Anyway, even if you wished to avoid a long lecture about the origins of life according to an atheist, most of that was crammed into a single episode you could just skip if you wanted to. And everything else about the original Cosmos was absolutely amazing, including the writing, narration, special effects, cinematography, music, historical detail.

That brings us to this Cosmos

Neil Degrasse Tyson is no Carl Sagan, but everyone already knows that. His narration, though largely friendly and amiable, lacks the dramatic weight, authority, and sheer entertainment of Carl Sagan. It's a heavy role to fill, and I don't blame the man for not being quite up to it. The beautifully filmed historical portions of Cosmos have unfortunately here been replaced with animated features that look a bit low-budget (Saturday morning cartoon quality). They are not, however, lacking in sincerity or dramatic story-telling. Strangely enough, some of them are actually quite a bit better than the rest of the show (particularly the story of man who discovered/invented the electric motor, and the man who discovered the danger of leaded gasoline and took on the big American companies profiting from a public health risk). These portions obviously lack the realism of something with live-action, but on a budget they were at least done with the right motivation.

The episodes themselves are a bit of a mixed bag. NDT makes some wonderfully encouraging statements about how the only important thing in science is seeking the truth, then goes on to tell the stories of how the Science Powers the Be repeatedly ignored people because of their social status. He makes broad statements about evolution, at times mocking religious faiths, then seems sincere when talking about ""creation"". I'm not sure if he is trying to acknowledge religions, mock them, or throw them a bone. It is irritating to see that this show, like most ""science"" shows has absolutely no problem with repeatedly referring to theories as facts (Fossil Fuels coming from Fossils is NOT a fact, but only an American Theory, to cite just one example) and and then mocking people for adherence to their own beliefs, which like the very things he is spouting as fact, are also theories. Ordinarily all that would make this just another science show, as it's pretty common for nature shows etc to repeatedly refer to evolution and then in the next breath say a creature was ""designed ingeniously"", but I expected more consistency from the Cosmos name.

The music in the show is okay, and the special effects aren't bad, but they are both nowhere near the awesome level of the first Cosmos. The big message in the original Cosmos was the threat of nuclear war, and it was heavy-hitting. The big message here is global-warming. And I do appreciate that the point that global warming is a genuine threat is argued intelligently, if perhaps a tad condescendingly.

My final thoughts: The ""Ship of the imagination"" in the original Cosmos was cool. In this show it's silly looking. There's some ridiculous blind optimism in this show, but maybe kids could use some more of that. And as for evolution vs creation? I would LOVE to see the experts (Scientists not zealots) go at it in an intelligent debate that shows the evidence on both sides (at least there are now a few science documentaries that give the creation believing scientists a voice). Until that day comes, I sincerely wish that documentaries like this either briefly acknowledged both viewpoints and moved on, or leave the subject out altogether.",1448755200,,4393,4.955223880597015

6300766,5,B00IWULSTC,"This magnificent tour-de-force, 4 DVD, compilation is a fitting follow-up to Carl Sagan's epic TV series of the same name. The narration by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is superb, even better than Sagan's sometimes irritating nasal tones. Several collaborators from Sagan's COSMOS, including Ann Druyan, Steven Soter and Seth MacFarlane are back for this look at the mysteries of the COSMOS and our place in it.

This 4 disc presentation is divided into 13 thrilling episodes which continue ""to transport you across the universe of space and time."" It includes the seldom, if ever, told stories of men and women who have made major contributions to the understanding of various aspects of our ""universe.""

6300790,1,B00IWULSTC,"I'm watching a ""science"" series on Netflix with Chase. The series opens explaining to my 5-year old that they will only be presenting facts proven by the experimental and observable tests of science and that they will ""reject the ones that fail.""

Then, with no uncertainty, they open up with an illustration of earth and say ""here's what the earth looked like 250 million years ago.""

Not what it 'could' have looked like, or 'might' have looked like, or what it was assessed to have looked like. They're positive this is what it looked like with no further explanation to its viewers. Just accept it as truth.

This is the third series I've started that has opened with nonsense - ridiculous unknowable statements made with absolute certainty all while claiming to be presenting scientific FACT. The last one (I think produced by Discovery) did a drive-by list of animals that used to be other animals. Dolphins used to be wolves, humans used to be apes, ants used to be dogs, blah, blah, blah.

No explanation. No questions. No uncertainty. Just accept it.

Add politics and money to it and is it REALLY that hard to understand why skeptics like myself exist? I'm not skeptical that science exists. I also don't think that God and science are mutually exclusive. Science has done great things for us, but it's our jobs, regardless of what the smartest person in the room tells you, to be skeptical and question everything. This mentality is actually the driving force behind science in the first place.

6300796,3,B00IWULSTC,"I watched the original Cosmos by Carl Sagan and was captivated by pretty everything in it. When I googled out (kind of by accident) this new series and saw Neil deGrasse Tyson (I've seen the guy once on YouTube) is the host, I thought the series is a major update over the original Cosmos and the material is well worth seeing.

Now, after I've watched all the new Cosmos, I'd say it's OK, but not as good as the original series. The new Cosmos follows the format of 13 episodes (keeping similar episode length) as the original series, and seems to me to suggest to replace the original series. Yet I think it should be watched as an update over the original Cosmos: all the original series stuff is still relevant, the original series tells it all in a compelling way, while the new Cosmos adds new relevant and interesting stuff, part of which (climate change) calling for immediate human action. Thinking of the new series as an update, I'd liked it to be shorter (less episodes) than the original - and with less repetitions of essentially the same content.

Neil is a very good host, provides good explanations in easy-to-digest style. Still, for me (Lithuanian), Neil's speech gets too quick and words get unclear from time to time. I rewind a bit and watch again, but only with partial success. I know dubbing or subtitles might help, but these would worsen the original experience.

The Ship of the Imagination, from it's outside, is great. From inside, I feel it is a bit ""hellish"" in style.

The series present very interesting stuff about the event horizon and interpretations of what it might be inside a black hole, different universes. There are compelling explanations of human-caused heating of the climate, promising propositions of employing solar energy.

I perceive some subjects (i.e. unleaded fuel, electromagnetism, heating of the climate) in the series to be linked less to cosmos (in the sense of stars and evolution) and more to general science and human life. Still, according to Sagan's description of cosmos, these subjects (and more) can be counted in. The climate change subject is very relevant, and I'm happy the series this caliber pass the message loud and clear.

For me, the animation (however good) in the new series feels not as nice as real-actor historical scenes in the original series. I perceive some animations needless (i.e. of two guys from Greece in Episode 6) and ""disney'ish"" (rather unsuitable for this type of show; i.e. molecule factory in Episode 6). ""Live"" scientists appearing next to Neil in the Ship of the Imagination look miserable and exhibit-like. Visual effects are cool and very realistic, but I think it'd be no harm to leave part of them out and let viewer's imagination do the job.

I agree with the other reviewer, that the story line in new Cosmos is not smooth, there are jumps here and there. I equally agree that motorbike ride episode is more interesting and the music is more memorable in the original series.

I like the extras - especially the ones from Library of Congress and Comic Con. These deliver some of Carl Sagan memories, and help to understand, why the new series was released at the time it was, and what is its real purpose.

To summarize, this is serious, compelling, relevant and professionally made show for the general public, presenting science in easy-to-digest style. Such good science shows come out rarely, so I'd recommend you watch it. Not separately, but in addition to Carl Sagan's original Cosmos.",1442275200,6,3500,4.839464882943144

6300816,3,B00IWULSTC,"This show has some important things to say about our planet and conveys what's happening to our world in more transparent, clearer, more convincing terms than I've seen before.  People of faith - you know, something like 70-90% of the world population, if studies are accurate - will have to endure an seemingly arrogant host who comes off intent on using his celebrity to promote his own personal bias.  More credible scientists, objective and learned enough to distinguish fact from theory may also find they want to turn their head in shame when they see some theories so blatantly misrepresented as absolute proven truths.

While the less objective aspects of the production cause one to question a lot of the other things they have to say, we ultimately felt it had some very worthwhile, if not imperative lessons to teach in the end.  Even if the first few episodes were way too presumptive and one-sided.  Sorry, but closed-minded science is just as bad as closed-minded religious zealotry.  And there is an obvious agenda that so permeates a number of early episodes, it makes it hard to forget even later on.

I'd also comment that I felt the CG in the show has been over-hyped.  We watched the entire series on Blu-ray - the best quality currently available.  While the non-CG footage looks great, the CG is just mediocre 10 year old typical TV series quality (think Stargate Atlantis).  It doesn't compare to cinema effects designed to be convincing on a much larger screen, nor even the level of TV effects commonly found today in shows like Game of Thrones.  Don't expect the CG to prove very wowing, much less convincing, on larger consumer displays, especially front projection.",1439942400,9,1693,4.86411149825784

6300863,3,B00IWULSTC,"A OK show, with many good parts scattered among the not so well done.  Neil Degrasse Tyson is no Carl Sagan, not by a long shot, though I never really expected anyone to be.  This show focuses in many ways on the the social or cultural rather than science, which is fine such as it is, but again, there is less focus on actual SCIENCE than the original.  It is very obvious that was a large focus of this version.  It may have been better if they had avoided ""re-doing"" what could not really be done better, like the half-baked space ship journey. The old version is better, even without the effects in my opinion. One example is the poorly re-done discussion of the speed of light. Sagan EXPLAINED  Einstein's thought experiment, and explained in detail how light is red or blue shifted, as well as all of the oddities you would likely encounter if you could travel that fast. Neil Degrasse Tyson's version involves a cute Italian girl riding a motorcycle in space- and riding and riding. He never does get to any explanation. More-women-on-a-motorcycle riding,  Still no explanation.  I found myself wanting to get a copy of the original to show my kid, as we watched this ""update"" together.

I admit, there were some very good sections.  The episode on how the discovery of the world was being poisoned with lead was really a side discovery, by an extremely careful researcher trying to figure out how his measurements kept being contaminated.  The hand cataloging of star types.  THAT is great science.

An OK attempt, but nothing compared to the original, and not really and ""update"" nor real ""continuation"" of the original.  Good for what it is.  Better if you never saw Sagan's Cosmos.",1433030400,4,1692,4.691525423728813

""This [scientific] adventure is made possible by generations of searchers [who] strictly adhered to a simple set of rules:

[1] Test ideas by experiment and observation.
[2] Build on those ideas that pass the test.  Reject the ones that fail.
[3] Follow the evidence wherever it leads.
[4] Question everything.

Accept these [rules] and the cosmos [meaning `universe'] is yours.""

The above is said by the host of this outstanding science documentary series, an update and follow-up to the 1980 original television series (entitled ""Cosmos: A Personal Voyage"") that was co-written by and hosted by astrophysicist, astrobiologist, astronomer, cosmologist Carl Sagan (1934 to 1996) on PBS and considered a milestone for science documentaries.  (The words that title this review were said by Sagan at the beginning of the original series and are again said by him at the beginning of this updated series.)

This updated series was written by Ann Druyan, Sagan's widow and astrophysicist Steven Soter.  (These two also helped Sagan write the original series.)

It is hosted by astrophysicist and cosmologist Neil deGrasse Tyson who, as a 17-year old student, met for a day and was inspired by Sagan.  (What a role model for the young Tyson!!)

Among this new series' executive producers are the multi-talented Seth MacFarlane whose financial investment was instrumental in bringing this show to television.

This series loosely follows the same 13-episode format and storytelling approach that the original series used, including the ""Ship of the Imagination"" and the ""Cosmic Calender,"" but features information updated since the 1980 original series along with extensive and mesmerizing computer generated graphics and animation footage as well as fantastic background music augmenting Tyson's excellent narration.

Some of the voice actors for the animated characters include Seth MacFarlane, Kirsten Dunst, Cary Elwes, Richard Gere, Marlee Matlin, and Star Trek's Patrick Stewart.

Each of the four discs of this series has an extra.  My favourite: ""Celebrating Carl Sagan.""

I enjoyed this new series immensely.  It was through the extras that I learned about Anne Druyan, Neil Tyson, and Seth MacFarlane.  I think, if Carl Sagan were still alive, he would have been quite impressed by his wife and the once 17-year-old student that looked up to him.  Personally, I was deeply impressed by Seth MacFarlane who was only 7-years old when the original series was televised.  I think Carl Sagan would have regarded MacFarlane as a good friend and science visionary considering his immense contributions to the series.

Finally, potential viewers be forewarned!  This science documentary contains no hocus pocus, abracadabra, or the supernatural.  It contains only evidence-based and observational science--science at its best.

In conclusion, this is an updated series of the original ""Cosmos"" series that was presented by the great science communicator Carl Sagan.  I leave you with five simple rules that are presented at the end of this updated series and what every critically-thinking person should remember:

(1) Question authority.  No idea is true just because someone says so
(2) Think for yourself.  Question yourself
(3) Don't believe anything just because you want too.  Believing something doesn't make it so
(4) Test ideas by the evidence gained from observation and experiment.  If a favourite idea fails a well-designed test, it's wrong.
(5) Follow the evidence wherever it leads.  If you have no evidence, reserve judgement.  Remember you could be wrong.

If you want to ever learn about the world around you, it doesn't matter what your age or education level is, you will come away from this series with far more awe and wonder about the world and universe you live in than you ever thought possible.

Some of the greatest moments of Humanity (both the well-known and the obscure moments) are re-visited in such exquisite and grand detail that at times I was moved to tears at the boundless drive and imagination of the human race. No other TV series has left me feeling like this is 1 planet filled with 1 people, humans, all in a grand, millennia long journey towards a bright and beautiful future.

Also, no other series has also left me with the knowledge of just how precarious that future is, and always has been. The emotions that this series can bring forth is the reason TV exists in the first place. If you love learning, you cannot bypass this series.",1429747200,,984,4.425414364640884

6300912,5,B00IWULSTC,"I will openly admit, Neil Degrasse Tyson is no Carl Sagan. The original Cosmos was one of the single greatest series every produced for television and a large part of that was due to Carl Sagan. He was just an exceptional speaker and his excitement for astronomy was infectious. That opening 15 minutes of the first episode was simply breathtaking. Here are 2 of my favorite statements made during that opening:

The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a great height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.

""in a ship of the imagination, unfettered by ordinary limits of speed and size, drawn by the music of cosmic harmonies. It can take us anywhere in space and time. Perfect as a snowflake, organic as a dandelion seed, it will carry us to worlds of dreams and worlds of facts. Come with me. . . .""

It wasn't the background or some amazing CGI that made that opening so powerful, it was Carl Sagan's passion and his ability to convey that passion though his incredible speaking ability. I am a HUGE fan of Neil Degrasse Tyson, but he just doesn't convey that same sense of passion that Sagan did. He has a much more monotone method of speaking so you really didn't get that same level of passion or excitement that the original series gave you.

That being said, this updated version of Cosmos was still brilliant and Neil Degrasse Tyson did a great job with the series. We have learned so much more since the original Cosmos aired so there was a legitimate need for this updated version. This series was just hugely entertaining, incredibly interesting, and the updated graphics/CGI were absolutely mind bending. These kinds of programs get kids interested in astronomy and this updated version of Cosmos was just a massive success all the way around. The people behind this series, many of which were behind the original series, should be very proud of their accomplishment. Just an outstanding job all the way around.

The bottom line - I immediately purchased this as soon as it was made available and have watched it multiple times since then. I am a space junkie and an amateur backyard astronomer and I can never get enough quality space documentaries. This really is a brilliant series all the way around and I can't possibly give it a higher recommendation. I know Sagan would have been 100% satisfied with this updated version and that is really the best compliment I can give this series. In all honesty, this series should be part of every public schools science curriculum. Yes, its that good!

6300916,5,B00IWULSTC,"I very much remember the original Cosmos series with Carl Sagan. They had the bar set rather high for this updated version. But the script was written by Ann Druyan, Carl's wife. Astonomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, while a still a teenager when invited by the late Carl Sagan to visit him at Cornel University, became the only logical choice as program host.

I was somewhat put off by the animations at first, but I have changed my mind. It was a good technical consideration. Live actors and real sets today would have been dreadfully expensive and, if not performed properly, hokey at best. The updated astronomical graphics, special effects and music was a real treat if not spectacular.

Was it just me or did Neal's voice and cadence sound a lot like Carl Sagan himself?

As an amateur astronomer of 37 years, there were no real surprises in the history or what was revealed about the Universe. Even after more than a dozen viewings now, I still appreciate the profundity of the material presented and experience more than my share of ""wow"" moments yet. It is THAT good!

With the appalling level of ignorance of the sciences, like astronomy, among lay people I would make viewing this program mandatory. What was revealed was truly that profound.",1428624000,,1248,4.763888888888889

6300918,1,B00IWULSTC,"The entire universe is one vast school that demands further investigating using endless explorations designed to gradually peel away layer upon layer of hidden obstacles leading to new revelations of discovery that exist now only as dark shadows we haven't tripped over yet. It's too bad this TV show's featured lecturer doesn't delve deeper into those cosmically significant mysteries that most atheists and agnostics simply refuse to accept since FAITH is the only price of admission, one apparently they are unwilling to pay for an enhanced awareness and a deeper understanding of those meanings and values that are of the utmost importance since they deal with revealed spiritual truths on equal terms with the evolving truths of scientific discovery. Neil deGrasse Tyson was once quoted as saying ""The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it."" This same concept also applies to the existence of God regardless of whether or not any planetary mortal from any of the trillions of inhabited planets out there (including ours) accepts this as being the existential truth that will always survive any scrutiny stemming from any experiential participant in the cosmos. He also said ""If that's how you wanna invoke your evidence for god, then god is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance, thats getting smaller, smaller and smaller as time goes on."" The phrase ""evidence for god"" reveals one of the obstacles that differentiates the atheist or agnostic scientist from one who believes in God. As a defensive argument against this pre-conceived notion of fallaciousness that God does not spiritually exist without material evidence of His existence, I would argue that the existence of the universe and its many living inhabitants transcends through faith the foolish and unreasonable demands for any other ""evidence"" of The First Cause and Center, our Creator Father who was sipping His morning coffee a few billion trillions of years ago (as we know time) for in Him we all live, move and have our being! God is the One who created all of us and keeps us living whether or not Neil or myself or anyone reading this wants to believe it. Without God, there would be no such thing as reality. If God withdrew from His active participation in the cosmos, the universe as we know it would immediately collapse and we would cease to exist. How can an Infinite Being reveal Himself to the finite creature? Jesus is the answer to that question. Through the mystery of incarnation by which this planetary bestowal of our Creator Son was made possible, we were given the gift of the living revelation of God that only occurs once in the career of every inhabited planet where a Son of God appears as a man among men.",1428537600,11,2751,4.918279569892473

I can't begin to express how much this type of educational broadcasting is sorely needed in our society. Especially one that caters to the young and the old. Allow me to preface by saying I consider myself an avid reader and at least somewhat proficient in matters regarding the physical universe. However, this show blows my mind! It definitely succeeds in showing an individual their place and role in the cosmos. I truly appreciate the steps taken to present the subject material in an ""easy to understand"" approach that appeals to all ages. The host, Neil D. Tyson, a well-known astrophysicist whose personal appreciation and dedication to the expansion of science is clearly seen in several episodes. As a caveat, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there are a couple of occasions where the host is critical of religion and its undeniable involvement in the history of some of humanities greatest scientific achievements. Personally, I applaud their efforts. Coming from a former religious background, I understand only too well the tactics generally used to discredit or deny the legitimacy of ideas that contradict the established theocracy. In short, I highly recommend this series.

6300976,3,B00IWULSTC,"Cosmos has high production values, and a Christian like me is happy to see God's glory in nature put on display, even if the play-by-play comes from a different worldview. I can't help but like Neil deGrasse Tyson; his excitement is infectious. It's clear why he's become the heir of Carl Sagan's popularizing work.

I'll use this little review to focus on one broad theme in Cosmosscientismand one little but important vignette inside itthe story of Giordano Bruno.

Scientism is excessive belief in the power of scientific knowledge and techniques.  Thats kind of funnythe very definition of scientism is belief, not knowledge. And yet adherents of scientism commonly claimin the words of one of scientisms leaders, Richard DawkinsFaith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence.

But scientism is a faith, a worldview, like any religion. Atheistic, materialistic scientism even has saints and martyrs, just like other belief systems. Cosmos introduces us to one: Giordano Bruno (c. 15481600). As Cosmos tells it in a series of (high-quality) animations, Bruno was persecuted by cartoonishly wicked Christian clerics for daring to suggest that the universe might be infinite, and that the stars might have their own planets. The way Cosmos tells it, Bruno was burned at the stake for his crimes against Christian dogma, becoming one of the first people to die for the one true Science.

Brunoand Galileo, and othersare often made to fit what historian of science Lawrence Principe of Johns Hopkins calls a widespread myth, namely that during the 16th and 17th centuries and during the Middle Ages, there wasa camp of scientists struggling to break free of the repression of religionists. Principe calls stories like the one Cosmos tells about Bruno folkloristic fabrications.

Instead of religion and science being at war in the Renaissance period, Principe says, the investigators of nature were themselves religious people, and many clergy members were among them. In fact, theological motivationsthe desire to read [divine] messages in the Book of Natureprovided the single greatest driving force for scientific inquiry throughout the entire early modern period.

Principe shows in his book The Scientific Revolution that Christianity didn't hinder science; it propelled it. As well it should haveand still should, because science is a God-created good.

I resist the effort of naturalistic, materialistic, scientism to steal the mantle of ""science"" and the cultural cachet it has developed. But I find it interesting that they feel they must cast themselves as the latest chapter in a romantic story of the progress of light against darkness. Science is not wholly different from religion.",1425254400,,2741,5.299539170506913

6301015,5,B00IWULSTC,"As someone who is not an expert in the hard sciences, I found this series to be wonderfully enlightening! I loved the way Neil spoke so passionately about our universe! There is a deep sense of awe and respect there. He and Carl Sagan both spoke so poetically, it definitely sparked in me a strong interest in astrophysics as a science and a spirituality. I had read in Carl Sagan's original book that he had written the book and created the series as a way to reach out to the general public and to get us excited about our universe, which I feel he and Ann Druyan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson have accomplished with this series. It helped to have them update the graphics and CGI in these reboot to reach a more cinematically sophisticated audience.

There have been some criticisms about this series of Cosmos that I will address here:

1) Animation: I've read that some reviewers thought the animation style was a little low-tech and creepy, and some would've preferred Pixar. I can definitely understand that, although, I found the style to be a balance between something that both adults and children could watch. For me, Pixar would've strayed too far into the kiddie realm.

2) Dumbed down science: I mentioned in the first paragraph that the series and book were originally meant for the lay public, people who aren't experts in the field. Even if some of the information presented is debatable, Neil encourages people to always question what you're being told, which I believe is a huge hallmark of research and exploration in the sciences.

3) Cosmos is pushing anti-religion agenda: I saw only hints of it, but maybe I'm biased because I read Carl Sagan's book first. He does not hold back on his views of religion. Compared to Carl, Neil was extremely mild in the way he presented his view.

4) The only thing I smirked at was the episode where a hot female motorcyclist was used to demonstrate the speed of sound and light. It was slightly cheesy, but easy to overlook.

Overall, I think they accomplished what they were going for with this series. If anything, it makes me want to pick up more docu-series and explore more!",1423526400,,2133,4.659574468085107

6301032,5,B00IWULSTC,"I would say a religion should be based on this, except any religion based on it would instantly devour itself on logic principle alone. Religion requires faith, which is inherent acceptance and belief in a thing without substantative evidence. Religion is the collection of people who individually claiming to ""know"" a thing to be true, specifically *without* evidence. Indeed, the more one points out this lack of evidence, the more the faithful dig into their own delusions.
The content of Cosmos: a Spacetime Odyssey, and Dr. Neil ""Just Neal, not doctor"" deGrasse Tyson's delivery of it is, and are, pure fact and art, written by numbers of such simple, logical beauty they can only be truly appreciated by the individual who has his or her eyes open, literally, to the message. Every point made from start to finish of this wonderfully crafted production was holds merit and historical significance, while presenting facts - *true facts* (the kind that speak for themselves, as compared to religious ""facts"" of comparable standing that usually require a bit of persuasive techniques to sell. Truth can't be truly sold). These facts come from all of human history and concurrent, consensus-driven, scientifica fact backed by years of scrutiny and nay-saying; and repeated, repeatable tests and results that monolithically guide our species into the future, even in the face of multitudes of those who appear incapable of figuring it out: ""Well, I can't understand it, so it must be untrue."" Or, my favorite ""God didn't say it, so it must be untrue."" Well, I believe in god, sure, only I also call it nature. I believe in the cosmos thanks to Cosmos. I don't need faith.

6301041,5,B00IWULSTC,"This rating is for the DVD set of four DVD's with 13 episodes total, DVD 1 with four episodes and the remaining DVD's having three episodes each.  Why is this important?  Organizing the DVD's in this way and naming each episode shows the order in which they can be viewed or re-viewed out of order.  Very good use of space, not cluttered at all as the DVD's, of course come in a single flip case with good plastic holders for all the DVD's inside.  The same introduction is played for each episode, which is fine because it is a short musical introduction about the beauty of life in the cosmos, not a problem at all.  The music repeats throughout, once again not boring in the slightest since it's part of the entire series, all related to the same general subject of life in the cosmos.  Without giving anything away, the viewer is transported both to the microscopic to the cosmic level of understanding and then seeing the places where we live and what we understand of those places, including our life-giving planet.  There is nothing short of the imagination so it's ok to let go of not being the one to think of it first.  One further note, the sixth star of this five star rating is the perfectly done animations throughout, so helpful in explaining concepts and stories, just exquisite!

Here are the caveats.  If you don't want a review of the history of science and the scientific method,  look into ""How the Universe Works,"" instead.  This sets a lot of context on how we have arrived at our contemporary understanding of the universe, which I feel is justified but which some will enjoy less.  Be prepared for time devoted to sharp criticism of creationism and the long antagonism of religious systems toward science.  And be prepared for a bit of hero worship of Carl Sagan.

My favorite thing about the show is every episode has a profile / narrative about a real world historic scientist which makes it incredibly interesting.

Also, I bought / watched it because I grew up on the original Cosmos, and I know this is a controversial statement, but I actually think this is better than the orginal Carl Sagan series (which is also excellent, btw).

6301096,3,B00IWULSTC,"Much of the new Cosmos series is much to my liking, and yet their persists an aftertaste . . . like inter-dental bits of bitter onion from a Chinese banquet. It's that persistent Giordano Bruno myth. Bruno was not a guy who'd feel comfortable with modern science. He believed in the magical powers of the Egyptian god Thoth.  Giordano's supposed insights into the cosmos are not his, at all. He borrowed from the writings of Roman poet and philosopher,  Titus Lucretius Carus (1st century BCE), and Neo-Platonist Marsillio Ficino (15th century). What happened at Oxford University portrayed in Odyssey's cartoon was not a question of heresy as Bruno claimed. It was about  plagiarism.  Oxford's archived records tell of learned university professors recognizing Bruno's talk as Ficino's. Not wining their approval, Bruno sought the support of Queen Elizabeth and Sir Philip Sydney with flattery. Then off to the power of Rome to win fame and approval. I can not honor the execution of Bruno. But hardly a sacred martyrdom. Sixteen century papacy was an institution of political power recently ruled by the less than pious Medici and Borgia clans. In 1600 Pope Clement VIII's attention was directed toward uniting European Kingdoms, both Catholic and Protestant, to fight the Muslim, Ottoman Empire. Bruno came at the very wrong time to criticize Christian orthodoxy. Bruno's story is neither a case for heroic science nor religious folly.",1420416000,11,1438,5.1587982832618025

6301116,2,B00IWULSTC,"I came to see if the reviews agreed with my disappointment in this series. At first I was a little surprised to see how many 5 Star reviews had been awarded. After further thought, I guess I shouldnt have been surprised as this series was already on TV, so most of those that purchased the DVDs had a chance to preview the product and surely knew they liked the show.
I remember being captivated by Carl Sagan in the original series and watched about 4 hours or the recent NGC marathon of this series hoping to experience the same. I don't know if Carl spoiled it for me, Ive learned more or this is just dumbed down to the point that it isn't very interesting. For example, I just learned that the horizon isn't really there. There is no edge.  The host has the job of trying to make this and an abundance of other rather elementary observations interesting, and in my opinion, isn't he really up to it although he does give it a good try. There are some interesting tidbits here and there, but Ive seen more interesting presentations of the same information on other programs.
Anyway, I just posted this as a warning to those like me that were looking for Cosmos part II. Id recommend watching a few episodes on TV before parting with your money.

6301118,5,B00IWULSTC,"What Neil successfully deliver in this series is his capability to communicate the idea, concept, story and reasoning behind each science topic

I always find my self alienated when trying to follow others science related video or TV programs, they start at high level and continue to disconnect from the viewer

Neil manage to keep the viewer passion and curiosity engaged in each episode, bringing enough information and knowledge to his viewer who does not require bachelor degree or something similar.

He did not afraid to said what science unable to proof yet, neither did he hesitant to open up story about wrong concept in the past.

6301176,5,B00IWULSTC,"As most know this is a reboot of the 1980s PBS series created by Carl Sagan.  It is not so much even a reboot but a continuation and update of the series.  The series was written by Sagan's widow Ann Druyan, who also co-wrote the original series with him, and hosted by Astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson.  He, like Sagan was during his time, is one of the most well known, if not the most well known and popular scientists of his time.  It was produced by Family Guy creator, science and space enthusiast Seth MacFarlane.

Tyson, like Sagan has a gift for breaking the science down into understandable parts so anyone, from a grade school child to a scientist or engineer can understand what he is talking about.  The show does a very good job of presenting the science without all the technical jargon and mathematics, yet not talking down to the audience either.  The one place where a more technical or detailed explanation would have been better is the time scale of the cosmic calendar.  They do say that a month represents about 40,000,000 years, but should have pointed out what anyone who has taken a chemistry or physics class that required doing unit conversion/dimensional analysis could figure out, that an hour would then be about 1.6 million years, a minute about 27,000 years etc, so when they were saying things happened on a certain day of a certain month it was more clear that represented a range of time, not January 31st as we think of it.  Since the show was not being broadcast on the science channel or PBS, but trying to appeal to a wider audience adding that would have made that part of it clearer.

The show also does a wonderful job of telling the history of some of the people behind some of the greatest scientific discoveries.  This is done mainly through animations, which I will admit when I watched the show during its run on TV I did not really like, but was not bothered by upon a second viewing.  One of the great things is that it did not just focus on the ""easy"" people like Newton and Einstein, but discussed Faraday and Maxwell, without whom we would not have electricity or all the electronic devices we use, Keppler and Halley, and Hooke (whom everyone who has taken a math or engineering class has had the pleasure or displeasure of encountering the spring equation named after him).  The show also highlighted many women whose contributions are not well known because they were in a male dominated profession many years ago.

The show was certainly heavy on Astronomy, but also talked about other topics including the more ""controversial"" ones (which are really only controversial because of idiot politicians who are pandering to their constituents who want to hear what they believe echoed back to them, and special interest groups) like climate change and evolution.  The shows devoted to climate change give probably the best layman's explanation for what is happening, and why it is dangerous I have seen.  It is really the one part of the series that did not ignore science deniers and, rightly, pretend they do not exist.  It took the arguments that many who deny climate change is happening give and refuted them point by point.

It likened the whole argument to that of the push to get lead out of gasoline decades ago and the oil/gas industry's attempt to refute the dangers of leaded gasoline.  It also showed there were papers being written as far back as 1958, included a clip of an old white guy from around that time (who I am sure some would accuse of being a part of today's liberal agenda), and a clip from the original Cosmos series with Sagan, all warning of the exact same issues with the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere back then that are being warned of today.  It also showed that some of the things they were saying could happen as a result have indeed started to happen.  It was the only topic that the series really argued with the ""other side.""  Otherwise it treated the other side as irrelevant and just aimed the show at those who wanted to learn and did not try to change the mind of anyone who did not.

The show also, in many spots, paid homage to Carl Sagan and the original series.  The best part in my opinion was in the final episode in which his ""pale blue dot"" narrative was played as the camera zoomed away from Earth and ended on the picture of Earth as a tiny speck as photographed by the Voyager probe when it was beyond Neptune's orbit.

As for those discs themselves, the show looks and sounds fantastic on Blu Ray as you would expect.  It also has about 2 hrs of extra content including a 40 min making of special, the comic con panel discussion in which the series was announced, and a half hour long tribute to Carl Sagan where Ann Druyan, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and Seth MacFarlane discussed Sagan's influence, the original series, and what they hoped to accomplish with the new series.  Definitely a lot there to keep those who like going through the bonus material happy.",1417824000,6,4982,4.587373167981962

6301210,5,B00IWULSTC,"This is a really good documentary that captivated my entire family! The children, aged 6 through 14, were full of follow on questions as we watched each episode. The historical references added the valuable element of human history to the science. The animation and audio is also first class. You know its a good programme when the adults are learning a lot, and the children want to keep watching episode after episode. Highly recommended quality family edutainment.",1416873600,,467,5.077922077922078
6301211,4,B00IWULSTC,"Definitely a must see, and the host did a great job filling in for Carl Sagan, but sadly this show is far from perfect. There are a few serious flaws. 1) The Star-Wars-like sound track becomes nauseating when played over and over. Just seems like it's tryingway  too hard. 2) The intro with the Universe being a (highly toxic if you know iridology) eyeball gets really old after you've seen it more than once. Just not interesting enough to watch 16 times (super long intro too). 3) Worst of all - there is perhaps no greater example of Government propaganda in action than the way this movie tries to push the Global Warming myth. Note that I have eaten mostly organic for 20 years, write for Natural News and other health sites, and am a gardener. But let's hear from the pro-GMO crowd how I want to destroy the world with CO2. This show demonizes coal, the auto industry, pushes the concept of ""Cosmic citizen (global governance)"", mentions Al Gore's ""consensus on climate change"", and seems to continuously force politics into what should be science. The show almost seems to try to counter what was obviously forced from above, with quotes like ""Venus did not have humans driving gas guzzlers but nature can still cause the greenhouse effect on its own"". Shame on the Government trolls who poisoned this movie for their own political gain.",1416873600,2,1344,4.719148936170213
6301212,4,B00IWULSTC,"I loved the Carl Sagan 'Cosmos' and I always thought Neil Degrasse Tyson was the right person to redo it.  And he is.  But the stylistic graphics can throw you off.  Its a shoebox style, and I don't like that so much.",1416873600,,217,4.119047619047619

6301218,5,B00IWULSTC,"This was a gift for my husband.  He LVES it! I think what is more surprising is that I LVE it!  We were both so taken with the series, that when he saw this, he asked if I would get it for him, as a gift.  I didn't hesitate.  What I love about this program is that it makes science interesting - fascinating, really.  One is learning without being aware that they are LEARNING, if you know what I mean.  It's learning via the entertainment route.  Neil deGrasse Tyson should get MAJOR kudos [and a medal] for making subject matter that I remember MANY of my generation dreading in school, actually becoming, ""must-see t.v."" for the kids of this generation!  I truly believe that material like this should be a part of mandatory curriculum in schools.  What a wonderful aid this would be for teachers! The photography and presentation of material is simply stunning! Neil adds insightful information as well as thought-provoking questions and ideas to the format of the program as well. He TRULY is a rock star! Had THIS series been available to me when I was a youngster, I would have taken more of an interest in science, and I mean that!  I think the way that Dr. Tyson explains very complex theories and scientific ideas in a way that is ""user friendly"", so to speak, coupled with the stellar imagery in each installment, helped to break down the mystery and bridge what was for me, for so long, a massive gap into the appeal of  SCIENCE as one's life-work or WHY anyone would want to go into this field. No longer.  I get it.  Dr. Tyson is a masterful teacher, and I know what that looks like, because I am married to one. ;-)  Don't hesitate to buy this! As someone who was NEVER big on science, I can tell you that this is quality viewing! It's fascinating - so glad we can watch it again and again!  Worth the price of admission!",1416614400,2,1836,4.406528189910979

6301221,5,B00IWULSTC,"This is a good series.  The Dr. who does the naration is not a man of God, but to me all he says and all he talks about proves in every way there is a God who made all this happen.  He never gets into the math of how it could have happened by chance, but I did and it is not possible useing anybodies numbers.  Man is not here for a few trillion years by only chance and oh yeah and then the sun is burned out.",1416528000,,410,3.6363636363636362

6301223,3,B00IWULSTC,"Except for one aspect, I really enjoyed this series. It portrayed really well some of the most fascinating achievements of scientific persons, namely in the fields of physics and astronomy. The visualizations on the cosmos were phenomenal, offering a perspective on the universe and our place in it that would be impossible without amazing computer graphics.

As a scientist myself, I did not appreciate the time wasted by this show to debase religion and belief in God. That theme was: 1) inconsistent with the other messages in the show, such that many of the scientists, like Newton, were believers in God, and 2) anti-progressive, not considering the potential for a believing scientist, only that someone is either an ignorant believer or an enlightened scientist. That view is pretty narrow and thoughtless.

But those parts aside, I really liked the show.",1416528000,18,862,5.15
6301224,5,B00IWULSTC,"The only thing that would have made this better is if they'd reanimated Carl Sagan.  I guess they did animate him though, so that's going to have to be close enough.

I do wish they'd re-release the original on blu-ray though.  I'd buy that in a heartbeat.",1416441600,,256,4.404255319148936

Otherwise the series is fantastic. Too bad for me that the only installments I didn't watch on TV are on disk 4 of my set. Seems to be divine intervention. The series was on sale so I don't feel too bad about it.

Edited: PS... for some hilarious reading please check out the comment to this post as well as many of the comments to everyone else who had the audacity to give the lord savior Neil deGrasse Tyson a 1 rating. There seem to be many deGrasse Tyson groupies around here chastising us ""1"" raters. And people thought fundie Christians were bad. This must be where all the youtube anti Christian trolls ended up.

6301240,5,B00IWULSTC,I watched every episode in real time and thought it was not only thought provoking but also intellectually stimulating. The science was clearly presented so that everyone could understand it without being overly simplistic. Too bad there are so many people who refuse to open their minds to new possibilities or would rather listen to pseudo-science being offered up as facts. Their uninformed opinions on the series pale in comparison to the actual science that is presented. I'd watch it again and again on Blu-Ray.,1415836800,,517,5.094117647058823

I was excited seeing the previews but after watching 2 episodes on Fox television (and keep falling asleep) this past summer I couldn't make my self continue watching the rest episodes.

6301254,5,B00IWULSTC,"Having grown up in the 70's, and having adored the original Cosmos series with Carl Sagan, I was eagerly anticipating the remake with Dr. Tyson...and I had my expectations exceeded immensely. With a 35-year update on everything from what we know about the universe to special effects to the Hubble, this series will leave you in wonder and awe of the universe around you, both big and small. Dr. Tyson is the heir apparent to Dr. Sagan, and he is a host filled with wonder, which he conveys admirably on screen. With a mix of real scenes, computer-generated graphics that look life-like, and animated historical stories, this series delves into equal parts education and exploration, with the limits only those of your imagination. If you saw the original series, and wondered what it would have looked like with modern-day technology...this series is for you. If you've ever looked up at the night sky, or through the lens of a microscope, and felt wonder at what you saw...this series is for you. If you prefer to use your brain rather than put in neutral by watching yet another inane reality show...this series is for you.

My little 8 year old granddaughter loved it. If it didn't contain the animations I doubt it would have interested her. Sure, for science majors this isn't particularly enlightening, but it is a celebration of the Universe and the magic it gives to our lives. It is a welcome diversion to the tons of garbage we have to listen to about the origin of the universe put forth by the religious community. It's comments on how the  7 Billion people are contributing to the demise of the rest of the animal kingdom are welcome in a world dominated by selfish and rich people.",1414800000,2,703,4.535433070866142

6301294,2,B00IWULSTC,"Wow. This blu- ray series definitely shows how far society has fallen into the religious worship of Evolution.
I watched the first 2 discs and it seems like every time Neil Tyson talks about real proven science on this show he adds a whole bunch of his Evolution beliefs in there. He also hints many times that Evolution is a fact. LOL!!  Therefore destroying the program and turning it into a faith program instead of science.
It would have been nice if they just stuck with science and logic.  1 star for good picture and sound. Another 1 added for comedy.

6301298,5,B00IWULSTC,"This series is visually beautiful, and Neil Degrasse Tyson conveys the information well. It is not Carl Sagan's Cosmos, however, it is a worthy update. Tyson is an excellent, well spoken, and approachable host, with a wealth of fascinating experiences and knowledge, which, much like Sagan, go far beyond ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey""'s bounds. Looking into Tyson's background, and previous work really enhanced, and furthered, experience with this series, and I would urge others to also investigate his NOVA specials and even interview appearances.
Most importantly, to me, was the emphasis on questioning, and not taking things as fact, even when they come from figures of authority, including this series, and Neil Degrasse Tyson.
The emphasis on individuals developing critical (but not blindly contrarian) lines of thought, questioning, research, and exploration was excellent. This appears most noticeably during segments which focus on often under recognized determined, inquisitive, and relentless people who have contributed greatly to our scientific knowledge, but are still obscure.",1412640000,,1094,5.7592592592592595

There is obvious difference between presentation between Tyson, who's more passionate and engaging, and Sagan who pulls you in with his soothing and free flowing language, but each makes me want to know more and engages my curiosity. I am happy that I ordered the whole Cosmos series and would recommend it to anyone who has even slightest interest in science. I also recommend, for those who did not, to watch Sagan's version it's worth it.",1412380800,,566,5.031914893617022

6301325,1,B00IWULSTC,"This production was a major disappointment to me.  (I am talking about the Fox Network broadcast.)  The original Cosmos series aimed high, they assumed a literate and engaged audience.  This is apparently Astronomy for Homer J. Simpson.  Just about every single thing was wrong with this production.  The original Cosmos series did not attempt to ""popularize"" astronomy by dumbing it down to a series of mindless cartoons and computer graphics.  I recall in the original Carl Sagan used the term ""rheological deformation"" while examining some photographs with a young female graduate student.  Slightly obnoxious showing off by Top TV Scientist of the 1970's, sure, and fewer than one in a hundred audience members knew what he was talking about. (The concept of rheological deformation is not further explored.) There's absolutely no chance of any of that here.  If a concept or idea cannot be made simple enough to explain to an inattentive high school freshman, it is shoehorned into a clatter of computer graphics and hand waving.

If you are interested in astronomy, but intimidated by its apparent obtuseness and jargon, buy any popular illustrated book or watch the very good History Channel series, ""The Universe"".  If you want to expose a young person to astronomy, for heaven's sake, and the young person's intellectual development, avoid this series like poison.  If you are literate and attentive, you will probably be pulling your hair out and screaming five minutes into watching this gawdawful series.  At least you were warned.

That the utter triviality and idiocy of this presentation is employed in the service of mendacious political correctness only amplifies its annoying effect.  This is stylish anti-science, neo-lysenkoism embraced by the inept producers, writers, directors and most prominently, the Host, the Apostle of Political Correctness and the Lord Protector of the ahistorical and contrafactual narrative.  They construct a series of strawmen arguments, which they cannot even bring themselves to engage.  They dispose of these strawmen of their own construction by merely dismissing them.  Apparently, they are training their acolytes to learn to dismiss (rather than engage) challenges to the one, true, holy, and apostolic Liberal Faith.",1411257600,36,2274,5.378531073446328

6301331,5,B00IWULSTC,"I read all the one star reviews for a good laugh. Clearly these are people who don't understand what the scientific method is nor do they have the desire to find out. They live in an exclusive world where only those who think, act and look like they do is acceptable. It means nothing to them that the very science they criticize is what they benefit from every day.

Were it not for science, the very reviews they submitted on this thing called the internet would not be possible. Were it not for science, the lights in their homes, the airplanes they ride, the cell phones they talk on and the television shows they watch (most likely FOX NEWS) would not be possible. Had it not been for those people (scientists among them) willing to think outside the confines of intolerance and ignorance, we would still be in the Dark Ages when survival of - not the fittest - but the most cruel ruled our world.

They call Cosmos politics yet they use politics to promote their own beliefs as well. I can countenance a persons belief. Everyone has that right. But I will never countenance hypocrisy. As my Pastor often preaches... 'the harlot will get into heaven before the hypocrite will'.

Do they not see that every scientific discovery serves as testimony to how much grander and more beautiful is God than our minds could ever have possibly imagined?

It soothes you as you listen, making you comfortable to hear more.
It was like taking a trip to the planetarium, which I love visiting the one we have here at McMaster University. For only $5 you can learn about the system we live in and beyond.
Even though space is the main topic, the show focuses on Earth too. It shows us why we are the way we are and tries to show us how it all began. That's no easy feat when even science is not quite clear on it.

Intellectually it would suit, and perhaps benefit and interest, an eight-year old, but its tedious anti-Catholicism makes it wholly unsuitable for young minds (we are given an anti-Catholic horror cartoon, slit-eyed clerics with skull faces in stygian locales, however little that might have to do with space-time and subatomic particles).

6301386,1,B00IWULSTC,"Mr. Tyson has a nice speaking voice and manner, but he is certainly no replacement for Carl Sagan.  The topics covered are arranged very poorly, and he jumps from astronomy to physics to biology to anthropology and to history in a most disconcerting way.  Most viewers would, I'm sure, much prefer a more linear approach, as in The History of the World in Two Hours.  Tyson's presentation is at about a 10th grade level, give or take.  He doesn't hide his Leftist political views, making it clear that he believes in anthropogenic global warming, even though the data has been fudged and there has been no warming for 17 years!  His comparison of the Earth's situation with that of Venus amounts to almost scientific malpractice; he is oblivious to the carbon cycle and the negative feedback loop involving CO2:  the more CO2, the more food, the more plants, the more animals, the less CO2.  In addition, he spouts the usual ""modern physics"" nonsense of the nuclear theory of the atom, the illogic of Quantum Mechanics, and the absurdity of the Big Bang, black holes, and worm holes.  All in all, I cannot recommend this work.  You would be better off reading the Random House Encyclopedia, with all of its illustrations (if not videos), and which is very, very nicely organized, then slogging through this series of videos.",1409616000,29,1324,4.797356828193832

The combination of sight and sound is simply stunning.  Shockingly so.  These are high bit-rate disks that expose the compression of 720p Fox broadcasts.

My wife and I were mesmerized, pulled inside the picture and enveloped by top-notch audio (60"" Sony SXRD with Atlantic Technology 5.2 system).  I found myself just shaking my head, asking my wife if it was really this amazing.

Every night, another episode. A monumental event without the searchlights.  At home.  Transported around the world and across the universe.  We just watched The Lost Worlds of Planet Earth.  Near the end is a series of pictures of people from around the world in our infinite diversity.  The detail and color (and content) was achingly moving.  Words fail me.

6301420,4,B00IWULSTC,"I gave this updated edition of Cosmos four stars because it's a well-written, gorgeous and compelling introduction to science. I would have loved to give it the fifth star but didn't because it is also unnecessarily anti-religion.

As for the science: the original Cosmos had a significant impact on me, and I was ecstatic when I learned an update was in the works.  As much as I loved the original series, an update was needed to discuss all of the new information that scientists have made available since 1980.  This time the image of our incomprehensibly large universe as one bubble in a possible multiverse waterfall did it for me: my mind just melted and I was left happily speechless after I saw that one.  Ann Druyan, Steven Soter, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brannon Braga, Mitchell Cannold and everyone else involved in creating this important work have my sincere gratitude.

That being said, this edition is clearly aimed at high school students.  Ann Druyan and Steven Soter have chosen to continue Carl Sagan's unfortunate habit of presenting religion in unrealistically negative terms.  They do reference Michael Faraday's faith as a source of strength, but the series largely shows how fundamentalist literalism has caused religious individuals to make mistake after mistake.  Additionally, there is no acknowledgement that fully practicing a religion inevitably requires a disciplined contemplation of ethics and philosophy.  It's unfortunate that the series didn't do more to show today's students that scientific learning isn't necessarily antithetical to religious devotion.",1408665600,4,1588,5.3453815261044175

While visiting the USA ten years ago I was privileged to meet with her and to tour Cornell University where Carl had lectured. It was also with sadness that I visited his last resting place. Carl Sagan was my mentor and the reason why I got into Astronomy, I shall never forget him.

Neil de Grasse Tyson together with Ann Druyan have produced a wonderful new version of COSMOS, which truly follows in the footsteps of a very great and noble Astronomer.

Host Neil deGrasse Tyson comes at much of the same material from Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" from different angles, and with more advanced technologies to present more advanced concepts and knowledge than we had 30 years ago.  Think of this series as a ""supplement"" to the original show, as different historical figures in the world of science are presented (rather than rehash the excellent live-action profiles of the scientists presented in the original), this time in 2-D cartoon animation.  While politely not naming-names, Tyson devotes some portion of each episode effectively debunking the pseudo-scientific (and I'm being KIND with that term!) arguments of religious fundamentalists attempting to discredit already unanimously accepted scientific facts, thus giving an already exciting show the extra gloss of being ""controversial,""  heh-heh!

6301454,4,B00IWULSTC,"A fascinating documentary series with only one glaring drawback. Host Neil DeGrasse Tyson keeps the scientific facts at worst engaging and at best mesmerizing. Early on, he shares a touching anecdote about his personal connection to Carl Sagan that ranks among the most stunning tributes in television history. The subject matter ranges from evolution to stellar movement, flowing with graceful ease from one field of study to the next without jangling the nerves, and effortlessly covers the entire lifespan of the universe. The visual effects are remarkable and Alan Silvestri's sweeping score is lush and riveting. But I can't give it five stars. Why? Because of the seeming thousands of cartoon vignettes. This has the feel of a docudrama, which is great, but presenting the ""drama"" parts as cartoons (also other fleeting images throughout the series), poorly animated and atrociously voiced, seems to serve only two purposes. One: to get kids interested in the program, which, if they're not into this kind of thing to begin with, humorless educational cartoons aren't going to help. Two: to justify Seth MacFarlane having his name on it (the painfully wooden animation is produced by MacFarlane collaborator Kara Vallow, but its shoddy quality doesn't resemble any prior works by either of them). I've never seen the original (it's high on my watch list), so I can't make any comparisons, but if you want to learn and can stand the lousy animated asides, I do recommend this. Or, if you find yourself drawn to said asides, keep an ear out for Cary Elwes, and the voice of Hermes Conrad from ""Futurama.""",1407888000,,1608,5.048872180451128
6301455,5,B00IWULSTC,"Watched this on TV and had to get it as soon as it came out on Blu-ray (my first ever DVD buy was the complete original Carl Sagan Cosmos, so it was fitting that the Tyson-presented Cosmos should be my first Blu-ray purchase). Awesome packaging, four discs in a box that looks like it should have only one. Now, on to watch it again.",1407888000,,333,4.21875

6301457,5,B00IWULSTC,"We followed this when it was televised recently and wanted to have the video. It's gorgeously filmed and richly narrated by  Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson. We saw the originally Carl Sagan Cosmos which concentrated on evolution. This series caught us up to date with what is current knowledge about space. For aspiring young woman scientists, he does focus some on their findings. E",1407888000,,376,4.968253968253968
6301458,5,B00IWULSTC,"Probably the best television mini-series I've ever seen!  After watching it live, I just had to have the DVD's to watch it again and again.  There is so much information and education about every topic from the Big Bang Theory to the actions/reactions within cells that it's hard to take it all in just watching it once.  Neil Degrasse Tyson is an amazing host - love that voice!",1407888000,,379,4.544117647058823

6301468,5,B00IWULSTC,"I was genuinely curious about those who rated this with 1& 2 stars and what I found was that people were so nitpicky and immature that a general complaint from them was about the animation style.

I initially wondered if I would like this even half as much as I loved Carl Sagan's, and I was so blissfully surprised when I did. In my eyes, no one can ever replace Sagan and Tyson doesn't try to IMHO, as he successfully delievered so much information and knowledge in very digestible manner. I wish absolutely every child on the planet could have access to this.

To the naysayers who feel like they're being ""preached at"" - honestly, you all REALLY need to be preached at, then you'd learn the difference between preaching and a valiant call to be more aware of the environment.

To everyone else, waste no more time in picking up a copy of this. Pick up a few if you can and share them around.",1407715200,,895,4.379518072289157
6301469,5,B00IWULSTC,"Great show. I usually can't stand Neil Degrasse Tyson but he's 'calmed down' a lot (if that's the right wording) for this show. He's playing the role perfectly. I can't believe how much this show blasts religion on FOX, for all places, and I absolutely love it. I also like how it says that science and religion CAN work together (for the religious), and everything doesn't have to be as black as white as people want things to be. Great show that Carl Sagan would be proud of. Much much better than the garbage 'Through the Wormhole' which I tried watching 5-6 episodes of and couldn't even sit through a whole episode.",1407715200,,620,4.544642857142857

6301473,5,B00IWULSTC,"I was a big fan of the original Cosmos series. This one has all the whiz-bang special effects that weren't possible in Carl Sagan's day, plus Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is able to explain complex scientific principles in a way that they can be (mostly) understood by the layman. And he hasn't lost his sense of wonder.

I had watched most of these episodes on TV, but I bought the set because I would like to watch it again at my leisure. Each episode is packed with so much information that it's hard to absorb it all in one sitting if you don't have a scientific background.

I felt that this version was every bit as informational and entertaining. Dr. Tyson did an excellent job of filling Carl Sagan's shoes. It was interesting to find that it was Carl Sagan who put Neil Degrasse Tyson on his carrer path of Astronomy. Both Tyson and Sagan are great showmen, revealing to us the many wonders of our Universe.

Some may think it is overkill to have both Cosmos and Cosmos a Spacetime Odyssey, but I considered it a ""two volume"" work. I was not disappointed.",1407542400,,610,4.648148148148148

That our species has come this far is a hopeful sign in the midst of so much war over religions; so much ignorance and blind, ego driven politics by ours and other governments around the world. It should be must viewing for all of us and mandated for education starting at a very young age.
This is our home, our only home. We cannot continue to rape it for all it's materials that have brought us life. Fracking, oil drilling, mining ever deeper into the planet we breath and eat from will shorten ours and future generations existence. The sun, our star has everything we need for energy.

The visuals are breathtaking and the writing is superb! Dr. Tyson explains everything so well and its comprehensive enough for anyone. If you want your kids (or you!) to better understand science and the discoveries that have been made so far, I can't think of a better way - let alone program - to do so. And if you get hooked as I did, I also highly recommend Dr. Tyson's podcast StarTalk Radio. Insightful, funny and free! Bill Nye the Science Guy makes appearances on the podcast in case he's coming to mind :) Don't think twice about watching this series!! You'll be glad you did!",1406592000,,711,4.696
6301550,2,B00IWULSTC,"Certainly not as good as the original, the updated ""Cosmos"" is just too politically correct and not enough science.  Now, as someone who received his education at Caltech, I know I am not the target audience for this program.  An updated show on the universe is certainly a good idea.  However, it strays from the point.
For example, a discussion of the measurement of the age of the earth is relevant.  A prolonged discussion of the scientist's subsequent fight with the oil companies to remove leaded gasoline, while it might be a good episode for an episode on NOVA, is out of place in a discussion of the universe and simply is toadying to the present administration's policy of bashing corporations.  Similarly, the prolonged discussion on global warming is just political correctness as the catastrophic computer models from the 1990s fail to have any basis in reality.  The global warming models are failing and would not be seriously considered today if they weren't being used for an excuse to create a carbon tax, which would cause a catastrophe in the American economy.
Although the science is good and a show to acquaint the general public with science is a good idea, it should be without political propaganda. In this regard, the current incarnation of Cosmos is a failure.
Just a final note.  They could have done a lot better with the animated discussion of historical figures.  They are so poorly done, they look like they were done by the guys on South Park.",1406592000,12,1476,4.8063241106719365

When Neil Tyson introduced his version of Cosmos, I had high hopes in light of his professional background and his story of actually meeting and getting encouragement from Sagan himself. Tyson has his own style, which is unlike Sagan. Tyson is more soft-spoken than Sagan was, but is just as intellectual. He is just as effective a teacher as Sagan was, a master at revealing the most difficult concepts to average people in an easy, lighthearted manner.

All this in a calm, soothing demeanor to give you a true, nonpressured way of learning.
I never truly understood the greenhouse effect on earth, why leaded gasoline was bad and why we exclusively use unleaded, as well as, numerous other topic that make you think in a different way, where you don't mind thinking about it, unlike society's pressure on us to recognize these issues.

6301583,1,B00IWULSTC,"In the episode on black holes, Tyson said: ""An entire universe could exist within a black hole"".  In the Astronomy magazine (August issue, 2014), David Eicher wrote that this is simply a nonsense!  A black hole would pull you into a proton string at the event horizon and then you'd be crushed by the gravity as you approached the singularity.  And not just you, but any other object in the universe would have same destiny, nothing can ""exist"" in the black hole.  Kip Thorne, one of the leading authorities on black holes says, black hole may start as compacting a matter, but the matter is gone, completely destroyed and no longer exists.  So, Tyson's Cosmos is not only religion bashing and cgi spectacle, but scientifically inaccurate, too.  Even in his own field of study!!!  The amount of inaccurate info on evolution theory that he propagandized and pronounced is unbelievable!  As Bob  Berman said in the (same issue) of Astronomy magazine, some astrophysicists are atheists and agnostics, some are religious, despite Tyson's efforts to suggest otherwise.  However, there is no doubt that atheist left really liked this entertainment show (that's what it really is),....it got honored with 12 Emmy nominations, go figure!",1406160000,17,1229,5.069651741293533

6301608,1,B00IWULSTC,"I was incredibly disappointed with the degree of bias apparent in what should be a straightforward  if not inspirational  series of science documentaries. As example: in the very first episode, the series misrepresents the prosecution of a Catholic heretic, Giordano Bruno, as if his punishment was due to radically advanced scientific beliefs when a quick check of Wikipedia shows, in fact, that his punishment traced to theological disputes (e.g., his pantheism, anti-trinitarianism). And this is only one example. In fact, a degree of distortion permeates subsequent episodes in much the same sloppy manner. Although I am not a Catholic, and don't feel personal umbrage at the slight, this kind of shoddy distortion of history is no better than propaganda for ""Scientism."" To this is added the third-rate animation commissioned for the series.

Neil DeGrasse Tyson has a way of teaching creative minds to not only begin to grasp the truly awesome workings of the origin of the universe, but to carefully weave the personal story of how real humans, some you have heard of and some not, discovered, and continue to discover, this through the ages.

6301629,5,B00IWULSTC,"Carl Sagan's original ""Cosmos"" is a classic television series that deserves to be on Blu-Ray where it would sit next to Neil Degrasse Tyson's new ""Cosmos."" Degrasse, using new computer generated graphics not available to Sagan, neatly updates the original series for a new generation of viewers. Sagan's widow was heavily involved in the production of this series, as she was in the original, and the continuity is apparent. In an age when the findings of science are being ignored by the nation's politicians, and the teaching of science is being disputed by some religious organizations apparently intent on perpetuating ignorance among people, this series should be required viewing.",1405728000,,686,5.302752293577981

6301632,5,B00IWULSTC,"Awesome graphics! Fantastic update of Carl Sagan's original series. My wife and I often talk about how we are getting to a point where computer generated images (CGI) can create some amazing images, but in this show they were wise to pick and chose when to go with a fancy CGI image and when to go with a cartoon to tell a human tale. Even the cartoonist was really good!

My physics teacher in high-school would always tell us the human story of the person who made the discovery or first performed the experiment that we were about to perform ourselves and that made his teaching style incredibly engaging.
I have learned a lot of science over the years and my wife is a high-school biology teacher and we BOTH thought this series was well done! My wife is even planning on using some of the genetics sections of the show in her classroom.

6301667,4,B00IWULSTC,"Content: Certain episodes are triumphs of presentation (particularly the leaded gas and global warming episodes). Others are a bit scattershot and frustrate by jumping around between subjects too quickly. Overall, a very entertaining show that provides a wide survey of current science, the scientific method, and science history. This doesn't go as deep as some documentary shows (such as Brian Greene's Nova specials or Neil Shubin's PBS shows on evolution), but it is a good show for whetting the scientific appetite.

The Blu-Ray: Video and audio quality are generally excellent, with loads of fine detail. Black levels do fluctuate a bit, but colors are always vibrant. Outdoor HD shots are typically better than space footage, which shows the most variability in quality.

The extras are rather lackluster. Only one episode receives a commentary. The lone making of documentary is pretty good, if a bit self-congratulatory. The interactive cosmic calendar is a waste of time and effort - too cumbersome to enjoy using, not enough content within it. I really would have liked to see deleted scenes, or perhaps additional spotlight documentaries on certain topics.

In sum, this is a good buy to get a layperson interested in science. It will entertain but probably not completely satisfy someone who has already delved into the topic matter in other formats.",1405382400,2,1363,5.243119266055046

The imagination, and the look itself is enough to draw a respectable audience into the world of science as it stands today. I believe that the world public needs to have some awareness of what is going on in the world because it effects all whether we benefit or not. The approach to the science involved in this documentary, seems to be design for any viewer, in other words you do not need to be a scientist to understand. In viewing the shows consider the reality of science never being exact, but a way of looking at things that can be explain through science to some degree.

6301695,3,B00IWULSTC,"This is an interesting show and the animations certainly make the show a bit more interesting than some science shows can be. However, when I consider that there is a Ship of the Imagination, I wonder how much of the show is based on imagination rather than observable science. Certain things can be cited as ""This is..."" rather than ""It is considered..."" (i.e. fact rather than possibility). It was fun to hear guest stars play some of the voices (e.g. Patrick Stewart).

The show at times seemed to aim at creating an emotional pull in some episodes. For example, the first episode puts Giordano Bruno as a martyr for his astronomical views killed by the Catholics. The Catholics did kill him but it was primarily because he denied the Trinity and other church doctrines, not because he said [the universe is infinite as God is infinite], as the show portrays. In a later episode, Clair Patterson, who gave today's calculation of the age of the earth, also discovered that lead is poisonous to humans and made a campaign against loading our consumable products with lead. This episode seems to devote a large amount of time to this lead portion (I think to make the age of the earth more believable since it was the same person). I think emotions can be a good thing but not when they are what make the ""facts"" seem credible.

I am a creationist and am not afraid of the show and rather enjoyed the show (though there were a few parts that I felt were unnecessary). Part of the reason I say this is because there were parts in the show where he clearly gave credibility to creationists but did it so subtly that few would notice. For example, in a grand canyon episode, he uses several minutes of CG to separate layers of the canyon and says that each layer took quite a few years to form. However, he then continues in a few seconds to state that if there was a catastrophic event, this time frame could be shrunk dramatically. I think he was supporting a catastrophic flood theory there. In another segment, he speaks of how the species of dog came about. He says that men selected wolves and they eventually domesticated into dogs, calling this artificial selection. He then argues that natural selection could create all of life given more time than artificial selection. He says it takes thousands of years for a wolf to become a dog but then says that it only took the last two centuries almost all the breeds that we have today to form. Why is it ridiculous for dogs to come from two animals four thousand years ago if this is the case?

I like the show when it provides observational science and explains how it works (e.g. the pendulum example where it just about touches his nose is quite fun). However, to take this and say therefore, the historical science operated xyz (or to simply say, this is how it happened without giving any evidence) is not a part of the show that I like. This show does give a good view of what macro-evolutionists believe but it is difficult to parse through what is science and what is simply the interpretation/imagination of that science. Some things I see no reason to disagree with and some things I do. It's good for all to watch, provided that you do not turn off your brain when the pretty graphics or cartoons come on the screen and then consider everything as fact.

I do not own this DVD set but am basing my review on watching the series through Hulu.",1405209600,10,3404,4.530081300813008

6301698,5,B00IWULSTC,"The most fantastic show! Eloquent and soundly expressive of scientific principles. There are a number of things that can be said about this show and so it shall be said.

The Good
We start where it began so many years ago and there is a timeline of extraordinary progress from that point. This Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is in many ways an extension of the original series. The personal journey of Carl Sagan was turned over to the Odyssey of hard facts as we know them today. Neil deGrasse Tyson takes the torch from Carl Sagan to expand our understanding of science and the people throughout human history who practiced its guiding principles.

We explore stars, earths of the past and the future, the natures of time, light, sound, speeds, spectrum, evolution, the microscopic and microcosmic. Every base is touched here and the ideals of a freedom to question authority. Science is the measure of how free we are and Neil gives us a narrative of a bright human future.

The Bad (Minor)
There is some repetition that ate into the show. Such as repeating the idea of a cosmic calendar in numerous episodes. Though these repetitions are viewed in the industry as necessary for communicating to those who didn't start watching the show on the episode that explained the item or concept initially. Though this aspect of the show is akin to picking nits.

The (Not Really) Bad?
Throughout the whole show there have been a series of animated sequences that people have said is unimpressive and in some respects they are right. However this should not be a reason to dislike the show, sense the content is still solid. The animations as they are were a economy measure for the show and indeed the overall budget was tight.

In the original Cosmos there were actors and extravagant film stages, with costumes, makeup stylists and the overall works of a well funded documentary film in those days. Some people are asking why that wasn't done in this reboot. Short answer - Money.

Summery
There is more to say about this show but the overall meaning of the show is the idea of science. Science is the pursuit of the truth. A means to understanding the Cosmos on a human level of understanding. There maybe things that are unknowable but these things could in time be exposed to us, via the geniuses that rise among us or the sudden accidental discovery of some new quirk of nature.

The show is good at sweeping up our emotions and exposing our buried curiosity. This has always been the primary objective of Cosmos: To inspire us to curiosity and discovery of the nature of the Cosmos. Through this endeavor of discovery we also discover ourselves.",1405209600,2,2644,4.70995670995671

 it is a marvalous inner experience. I learned a lot from it that I did not know and at the same time updated my own
 knowledge. The presentation was put in laymens terms that allows even a newcomer to understand Tysons presentation
 with ease. Great filming and teaching. Good for the entire family. I will watch Cosmos again many times in the future.

6301716,4,B00IWULSTC,"The history of science in this video is great. But these videos DID NOT give a veiw of the universe as it really is. We live in a universe of pure limitations and requirements of energy mass @ the speed of light in a vacuum of space and time in the midst of infinity. Existence is always trying to equalize and fill all space, and its had forever to do it. To have an edge or a hole in existence is as absurd as thinking that you could make a big hole in the ocean and not expect the water to fill in. Existence and all that it does is the affect of pre-existing  energy mass @ the speed of C at its limitation at every moment, contained in a volume of space the size of sub atomic particles. These particles maintain their motion from a complete environmental mass effect at the static of the constant of the speed light. Perpetual  by gravity in a re cyclic nature  of  natural fluid mechs of changing densities as energy diminished with distance .These particles are always shoulder to shoulder with each other  to infinity, requiring a complete environmental mass effect of equilibrium to trap energy @ the speed of C  in a spinning ring . With out a complete environment of mass you don't have a medium for equilibrium cause and effect any ware.

6301804,5,B00IWULSTC,"A visually stunning update of the late Carl Sagan's tour de force original.  I've only watched about half the episodes to date, but Tyson does an excellent job explaining the latest cosmological theories, as well as the classical topics such as relativity and quantum mechanics.

I know some people will take offense at the concluding episode, which speaks to global warming. It does seem the amounts of man-made CO2 and other greenhouse gases pale in comparison to that produced naturally.  But as pointed out by Tyson (and Sagan's ""nuclear winter"" previously), Earth is in a delicate radiation balance, or dynamic thermal equilibrium, between a heat source, or the sun - and a heat sink, or space.  As chaos theory teaches, a small change in such a dynamic balance can be amplified to a huge consequence - such as the famous ""butterfly"" effect.  This is not a 'linear' system by any stretch of the imagination.  So when one of the restoring force limits are exceeded, the whole system can tilt out of balance until a new local minima is reached, which may not be very suitable for human habitation.",1404604800,,1100,4.824468085106383

I consider him my new teacher next to Carl.

The Production Team has done an outstanding job on this project and it is a major compliment not only to the progress of science in general but to Carl Sagan specifically. The story of our world and its universe is mind boggling to say the least, but Mr. Tyson et al have been able to explain so much of this complicated star stuff and break it down into simpler terms for the rest of us non astrophysicists. Mr. Tyson's words glide gently across many sacred religious beliefs without offending anyone but he asks you to take a closer look at your world around you. Look again at the sky, the oceans, the Grand Canyons of our world and others, and to realize the geological process you see around you took 14.5 Billion (14.5x9) years.

The United States has become 95% scientifically illiterate. 1 in 4 people believe the sun orbits the earth. In a world where everything we interact with, from our device to our food, is made with science, understanding isn't just important, it's mandatory. Global Warming is real, Evolution is real, these are not things up for debate. We do not tell our children with their malleable minds lies just because we choose not to believe in them. That's actively destroying our future. In a world where people are marching to stop the science that will help sustain our population, and refusing the medicine that protects us from the worst diseases, we cannot risk generations going through grudgingly boring science classes, destroying the beauty and magnificence that Science has to offer. What amazing discoveries we have made, why it matters, these untold stories are what really muse our spirits and humble ourselves. The Human Race needs to have a lot more Humility. Our children must stay humble, and they must be skeptical, and intelligent, and we shouldn't bamboozle them. They deserve better, we deserve better, so we shouldn't bamboozle ourselves. Let's change the world. Let's communicate science to them in a way that shows them how ominously beautiful the universe really is. Let's help them understand why prejudice and beliefs shrouded large portions of history and kept us in the dark. And let's do it for Carl Sagan. - Von Halford",1404432000,6,1577,5.069230769230769

The series does a fantastic job blending actual footage, CGI, and cartoon re-enactments to both tell a story and educate the viewer.  I watched the series on Fox, I've now bought the blu-ray, and I hope to eventually share this with my kids in the hopes that it will excite them the way it excited me.

There is no ""multi-format"" it's all BluRay. Come to find out I needed to purchase another $90 software package to make the BluRay work on my computer. This is because Sony owns BluRay and like they always do, they put you in a bind. They also flash around that you get so much more content with the BluRay version which is again untrue. I decided to trash this and BluRay. Sony has again left a bad taste just like when they secretly loaded a root kit on my computer and had to take it off when they were discovered.

Her imprint on the script is by far the best part of the new series.  With her collaborator Steven Soter, they have created a very impressive patchwork narrative that binds biology, astrophysics, and cultural heritage in much the same way as the original Cosmos series.

The other production elements do not live up to the very high standard set by the script.  In some cases (such as the animation that accompanies the discussion of photosynthesis), the clash between word and image is so strident that at times I would suggest you close your eyes.  The production houses involved do very good work (notably Tippett Studios, which turns in characteristically nuanced 3D CGI work), but the director was clearly not able to control the resources at his disposal and the result is an enormous amount of squandered potential.",1404259200,,967,5.056603773584905

6301836,2,B00IWULSTC,"The script and Dr. Tyson's delivery of it sounded as if he was addressing a middle school class of Intro to Science 101
Every episode of the series seemed padded or squeezed to make it to fit into a thirteen-week long chain of commercial breaks.
The animation that was promised raised my expectations but it was greatly oversold.
I didn't expect Pixar quality animation but this had a dark and gloomy Scooby-Do look and was as wooden as the Flintstones.
Executive producer Seth MacFarlane got his start on the Flintstones and is creator of several wildly successful animations including ""Family Guy"" among others.  I've never seen any of them.  I only wish they had paid the extra bucks and given the job to Pixar the subject matter is worthy of such respect.  Pixar probably said they were busy turning out another Academy Award winning feature film, but feel free to call back in ten or fifty years

I won't even broach Dr. T's decent into ""climate change""  He has already scared the crap out of us by saying some day the sun's going to explode and swallow the whole Solar System so who cares about a little climate change?
The subject is irrelevant to the topic of Cosmos it would be better served in a natural history film from Al Gore and his accolytes to preach.  They should go to China to preach instead of scolding me for not riding a bicycle to work as did the Chinese 40-years ago.

6301848,5,B00IWULSTC,"Watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos is what helped driving me towards science. Sagan's original series was a masterpiece. It is still a classic although many aspects of science have developed further. This is understandable and the reason why science is humanity's most powerful and successful activity. Tyson's (and Druyan's) Cosmos is also a masterpiece. Using very interesting stories about a number of scientists, supported by modern CGI and incredible videography, the standard for future shows of this nature has been raised. What is more important, the treatment drives home many of the fascinating aspects of science, its discoveries, its role, its importance, the human factor, and of course the constant conflict with snake-oil salespeople who realize their role in life is diminished by its discoveries and, thus, attack its findings defensively. I am convinced the new Cosmos is already spurring the scientists of the future. If I could meet the producers of the series, I would tell them: ""Thank you. Thank you very much for the work you have done for science and rational thought. Thank you for keeping the candle lit, for it is still dark around here."" As I look over many of the reviews I see way too many snake-oil salespeople and know-nothings that attack this work for no other reason than it removes the curtains from their make-believe fantasies. While I understand the source for their defensiveness, I wonder how deeply they have actually thought about the importance of science, rational thinking, and evidence-supported wisdom. For one, if they are so anti-science what are they doing online, using the tools and fruits of science? To willingly participate in modern lifestyle and yet attack the reason for what makes that lifestyle possible is not just hypocritical, it is delusional. It is like claiming to be a vegetarian while ordering a medium-rare Filet Mignon at a steakhouse. How about being truthful to yourselves? You may fool yourself, but you're not fooling us.

6301852,5,B00IWULSTC,"We don't have satellite or cable TV, so we watched the over-the-air broadcasts of Cosmos, and were fascinated by them despite the low resolution, static on the TV image and so many commercials. I was anxious to see the entire series again so I ordered the Blu-Ray version of the series and have greatly enjoyed seeing the series again in crisp and beautiful high resolution.

It seems that the relatively small ratio of people who give this series very low ratings have one or more of just several objections: they don't believe that the Earth is as old as it is, for religious reasons; they object to the scientific material and assessment of the carbon dioxide we're adding to the atmosphere and its implications for the global warming we're experiencing, for ideological (almost religious) reasons; and an objection to the ""theory"" of evolution, for religious reasons.

I have a couple questions for the religious people who believe that the Earth is only 6-10 thousand years old-- How did Noah and his family collect and place on the ark the many tiny or microscopic animals on Earth at that time, all the insects, the tiny tardigrades, all the bacteria and other microscopic organisms? And since the flood covered the world and must have killed all the land plants from both submersion and the poisonous effects of the dissolved salts in ocean water, and since plants weren't included in the species to be saved by the ark, why do we have the great diversity of plants that exist today? Did they all evolve after Noah and the Flood?

Cosmos is an extremely good series that accomplishes the astonishing feat of being appealing and fascinatingly educational to both adults and children. It is a great asset to us as a society. Thank you to everyone involved in its production.

On the Sunday nights this show was on Fox I parked my teenage boys in front of the television, usually with some grumbling. The one small complaint I had was the editing or abrupt cutting to commercials on Fox. In one moment your seeing life affirming stories about the creation of our planet the next a Tide commercial. With the the DVD set you won't have to worry about that. You'll have uninterupted journeys with Dr. Tyson and his ship of the imagination as he shows us how the universe was created and expanded. There are also many interesting stories about the early pioneers of scientific discovery. They are recreated nicely with animation. In the first episode Dr. Tyson shares with us how he, a teenager and an aspring scientist came to meet and be inspired by Dr. Sagan, the creator of the original series on PBS back in the late 70s.

As with Carl Sagan, however, he also did not consider the fact that the ""Big Bang"" did not just simply make matter appear, a Supreme Being, a Creator, a God decided to start it all.",1403481600,,437,4.576923076923077
6301862,5,B00IWULSTC,"This reimagining of Carl Sagan's 1980's TV adaptation of his bestselling book retains some of the devices, most notably the silvery, gleaming spaceship that takes it's host, and viewers, anywhere you can imagine. New host Neil deGrasse Tyson is an excellent choice, a respected, bona fide scientist with charisma to burn and a face you can trust (I think he rates a 10 on the Cronkite index). The writers and producers let the narrative flow in the same, almost meandering way the first series did, but the transition from subject to subject has a cohesion to it that belies a carefully plotted narrative. The CGI, of course, means that visually, this new 'Cosmos' is far more free in it's ability to explore the universe: from the seemingly endless depths of Jupiter's atmosphere, to the methane lakes of Titan, from muons and gluons to quarks and electrons, from hydrogen nebula's to brown dwarfs to white giants; from binary stars, neutron stars, and supernova's to quasars and black holes... well, you get the point.

Although these topics have been covered in other science-based shows, few have covered the breadth and depth of topics Cosmos does in such an appealing and accessible manner. Having a producer like Brannon Braga, who was a writer and showrunner for Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise, certainly helps when it comes to making a series about science and space interesting. And having a producer like Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy, certainly helps when it comes to... well, getting Fox to throw money at you, I guess. The money was obviously important, as every episode of this informative, and above all, entertaining look at our universe feels big, monumental.

While I would have liked to see a more classic style and a higher frame-rate for the cartoon sequences that recreate milestone moments in science history, I liked the decision to use animation instead of live-action scenes; the shift to animation serves as a metaphorical reminder that history is not a science, often relying on ancient accounts that survived through versed poetry subjected to a multi-generational game of 'Telephone'. The return to modern science topics is signaled by the return to modern technological advances like digital cameras and CGI. Old school cell-animation in a classic style would illustrate the philosophical divide more clearly, but this, however, is so minor it doesn't merit mentioning -- my contrarion nature demands I look for faults until I find them, but 'Cosmos' provides little game for fault-hunters... the cheaper, trendier Flash animation works fine with the superbly written tales of science history, adding another perspective to the visionary scope of the show.

There are actually quite a few shows devoted to similar subject matter; 'The Universe' is a good example. I've found most of them a bit elementary for anyone who considers themselves scientifically literate, and very repetitive. Every gap usually signals a commercial break from the broadcast run, and is followed by a completely unnecessary recap of the previous segment, making it feel as though every two steps forward triggers one step back. 'Cosmos' is a welcome addition to a higher class of science-based program, of which the PBS series 'Nova' has long been the gold standard; in particular, the instalments presented by physicist Brian Greene, such as 'The Elegant Universe', an adaptation of his best-selling book, have been stunning examples of material that appeals to both relative newcomers and viewers with a subscription to 'Discover' or 'Scientific American'. There are also some recent series that did for 'nature shows' what 'Cosmos' does for 'science shows'; like 'Nova', 'National Geographic' has long been the best in its class, but the BBC series 'Planet Earth', 'Blue Planet' and 'Life' were exciting and ambitious television 'events', using cutting-edge cinematography and cameras with an IMAX-caliber frame-rate. It's not really fair, however, to compare 'Cosmos' to anything except the original. I'm just glad no one replaced Neil Degrasse Tyson with Oprah Winfrey*.

[*When 'Life' was released for North American audiences, veteran narrator David Attenborough was replaced by Oprah. Anyone buying the DVD or Blu-ray can choose between the original UK or US versions, which also differ regarding episode length; the American episodes are shorter to accommodate commercials.)",1403481600,6,4446,5.27542372881356

The production values to truly world class. Tyson is a fantastic star nearly (though not quite as great as) Sagan himself.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  The religious lunatics who condemn it as unbalanced are not being fair to it.

6301889,5,B00IWULSTC,"I always seek 'truth,' and I won't be a sucker for some preacher trying to sell me bible baloney, while living off the ignorant believers who pay their salary.  Every year lately, the percentage of atheists in this country increases.  Public schools, television, the Internet increase the amount of science available to the public.  And while it's difficult to divorce yourself from the ignorance of previous generations, it's essential to our nation that science prevails, and religious dogma fades into the past along with idolatry and animism.

I purchased Sagan's original series, and I watched this full series on television.  I plan on purchasing this in blu-ray in the coming weeks.  I didn't like the first episode in this series, and it took me a while to enjoy the animation style, but overall, I was captivated with this series, and I enjoyed following the science.

Stop believing those men standing at the front of your churches.  They are there to make money off your ignorance.  And treat the bible as you would any work of old, science fiction.  Religion allows you to stop thinking, and just rest your mind on the propaganda of those relying upon your fears and ignorance.  And, by all means, stop the child abuse of making your children believe religious mumbo-jumbo.  Start being concerned with this life, instead of spending your time worrying about an afterlife that will never be there, in my opinion.  Eventually, you'll just be a bag of bones, and the molecules that were once you, will be returned to the machinery of the universe.",1402963200,8,1556,4.893129770992366

Sadly, the original Cosmos does not hold up well visually even while the content is still brilliant. Neil Degrasse Tyson, Ann Druyan, and of course Seth MacFarlane help create a visually stunning upgrade that keeps much of the wonder of the original series. I can only hope that in our age of science illiteracy and willful ignorance that this show will again inspire and motivate a generation of scientists to carry us all forward.

It's took both simple and complex scientific theories and made them accessible to public masses.  With this update brings with it the extra knowledge and discovery that has happened in the intervening years.

Neil Degrasse Tyson takes the helm this time around and does an amazing job of bringing to live many of the wonderful mysteries of our world and beyond.

I eagerly awaited each Sunday evening to see what wonders I would learn and pre-ordered the Blu-ray as soon as it became available.

The original Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan, while arguably more poetic and eloquent, had its own fair share of detractors. Thankfully the majority of those who watched, purchased and rated this series can see the value of its contents.

I submit that anyone who rates this series poorly or labels it propaganda simply isn't capable of accepting humanities true place on earth. Climate change shouldn't be a dirty word and given the fact that this series tackles the topic sufficiently I won't beat that drum here. If you can approach this series without your ego front and center it is beautiful and uplifting.

How he can explain extremely hard to understand concepts and boil them down to the basics, and build them back up again to explain to everyone is astounding. The man knows his science, and how to reach people. And that is never more evident than in this series. He does Sagan well in his turn as the host of science. You'll learn so much from this. A must own for anyone who appreciates science.",1402963200,2,521,4.381443298969073
6301894,3,B00IWULSTC,"Really, it's a 2-star series, maybe even a 1-star if you hold it up in comparison to Carl Sagan's original, but I'll give it an extra star because Neil de Grasse Tyson was an excellent host and narrator. He makes this at least bearable.

Unfortunately, the episodes meander all over the place, jumping from one part of the solar system or universe to another, then to animated historical skits, interspersed with a lot of impressive-but-pointless CG effects. Other series like 'The Universe' and 'How The Universe Works' at least managed to stay on topic and follow a discernible train of thought.

If you're a fan of the original, or of good space documentaries, I guess this is worth having, but lower your expectations. It's okay, but not great. Also, it does get a bit preachy at times on some contemporary political issues (secularism, climate change), which will turn some people off and may even end up dating the program in a bad way.",1402790400,21,942,4.773006134969325

Carl Sagan would be most proud of what his young apprentice (Dr. Tyson) has brought forward.  The people who continue to foolishly deny man's contribution to global warming and the religious nut jobs who laughingly believe the entire universe is only 6,000 years old receive a well earned trouncing by the professionalism of this series.  I sincerely hope there is a part two forthcoming at some future point.  Whether there is or not . . . we have this fine body of work.

Just that the world took millions of years for Humans to exist. The  global warming idiots again, don't look at the facts.  97% of scientists know the Facts and the rest are blind to the truth.

This is a series that you can watch with your children and it will definitely awaken the curious scientist in them too.  It combines stunning special effects with animation to bring history and the unknown to life. What is more brilliant about the series is that it explores astronomy, physics, and quantum mechanics to biology, archeology, and geography.  It covers it all so well!

6301916,5,B00IWULSTC,"I remember being a very young kid and catching the original Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan.  I was just stunned by it and it opened up my imagination to a whole new world.  It started a fascination with the Universe and the nature of the human mind that has stayed with me well until adulthood.  I often would watch the Sagan series again, even now.

I do miss Carl Sagan and type this as I look up at a framed poster I have of him in my office.  He touched so many lives and opened up so many minds.  Neil Degrasse Tyson has this same gift to explain the wonders of the universe.  I have long been a Tyson fan after hearing him speak.  Then once he published, ""A Death by Black Hole,"" I became a super fan of his.  I often thought he reminded me a bit of Sagan by reading his writings and listening to him speak.  When I found out Cosmos was going to be remade with Tyson as host, I was overjoyed.  This remake was long over due and I am glad that one of my other favorite people, Seth MacFarlane, had a hand in this recreation.

Upon watching the series, I got a little choked up seeing Carl's face return to the screen.  From then on my eyes were glued to the screen as Tyson took us on another journey via the Space Ship of the Imagination.  The series was wonderfully done and explained hard to grasp concepts in an amazingly simple yet effective way.  I knew halfway through the series I would purchase this as soon as it came out.  I have shared the series with my 7 year old niece and it seems to have the same spellbinding effect on her that the original did on me.

I realize that is a pretty bold statement, but it is easily justified.  Cosmos is science for the non-scientific.  It is the single best tool I have seen for explaining the wonders and marvels of our universe to the lay person.  If you are a scientifically adept person with an average college education, this may, at first, appear to be too simple for you.  However, the way in which the ideas and facts are presented will reinforce what you already know.  It is a program for all.  If you are scientifically ignorant (not a crime, and certainly fixable), you really need to watch this.

Bold and brilliant.
The show tackles not just the universe and astronomy, but biology, botany, geography, anthropology, and of course a lot of history.  How did our planet form?  Why does our solar system orbit the center of our galaxy?  How did people actual create the current species of dogs that exist today?  These and hundreds of other questions are explained in beautiful, amazing graphics that would have been impossible even ten years ago.  Do you want to know why the sky is blue or how light, in general works, know is your chance to not only understand, but to understand to the point where you can actually educate others.

Relevant and necessary.
Like the original series, Cosmos explains our universe.  However, it has been updated to to showcase the latest scientific discoveries and cleverly juxtaposes current knowledge with the history of a particular subject.  Nothing is old or out-dated.  It is new and fresh. Cosmos is also a much needed reprieve from all of the crazy fictional pseudo-science that has been propagating all forms of media over the past few decades.  From alien autopsies to young flat earth ""scholars,"" we have been bombarded with imbeciles on a global level.  Cosmos takes real science and brings it into peoples' homes.

And then there is Neil Degrasse Tyson.
One of the things that made the late Carl Sagan a hero to much of the world was his ability to take the complex and explain it.  Sagan was also brilliant at debunking crazy ideas that were nothing more that fabricated nonsense.  Neil Degrasse Tyson carries on that role and does a more than admirable job of it. Speaking with authority from years of experience and education, he exemplifies how today's scientific community needs to act.  There has been a major disconnect between the scientific community and the rest of the world.  Cosmos reconnects us all.  Reality has a new spokesperson.

This is a must for every DVD collection.  In fact, I would say it is a must for every household in America, Period!",1402531200,10,2762,4.745798319327731
6301918,5,B00IWULSTC,"COSMOS is a phenomenal series, and then some!  Neil deGrasse Tyson is simply brilliant in passionately describing, in layman's terms, all the science and facts in how this universe came to be.  Even my 9 year old daughter watched many episodes with me, and I explained to her what we were watching.  The episode on adverse climate change and global warming was very educational (and disturbing), especially as related to anthropogenic climate change facts.

It address many questions we have about the Universe but also touches on issues that affect the human population today. In the original, it was filmed during the time of the cold war which threatened human civilization as we knew it. Today, the show focused on our current world-issue of global warming. You can complain and stomp your feet all you want but that doesn't change the fact that global warming is real and this show properly and effectively provided us with insight into these issues and how we may come to fix them.

This show provided us with great insight into how the universe works and how we should cherish our place in it. It truly implores you to seek knowledge first and to question everything. This show feeds the natural curiosity that arrises in all of us. Good job Cosmos team.",1402444800,13,924,4.6

Learning SHOULD be fun, and when you learn while being entertained, that's even better, and for me--more effective.  Neil Degrasse Tyson is the rock star of science and I only wish there were many, many more of him.  He breaks the complex down into more easily digestible pieces for those of us who are not astrophysicists.  His enthusiasm and delivery makes me want to learn more.  He and the entire COSMOS team should be applauded for that.

6301927,2,B00IWULSTC,"While the special effects are fun to watch, the show relies too much on the imagination and not enough on actual testable data.  It has also left a lot of historical data on key individuals that they claim were on the side of evolution when they actually were men and women of great faith in God as creator and Lord. There is a definite bias towards evolutionary THEORY and stating evolutionary claims as fact.  Why are they so afraid of showing how creationists interpret the same evidence? is it because that the evidence lines up best with creationists than evolutionists? What I would like is a show that explains both arguments in detail and with equal conviction and then allow people to make a better educated decision as to which one best suits the evidence left behind in geology, fossils, and the universe.",1402444800,13,816,4.699300699300699

6301929,4,B00IWULSTC,"This is a good series if you are a history buff. It shows the very interesting development of people and ideas throughout history. For example it discusses the change in thinking from an Earth centered universe to a Sun centered solar system that is 1 tiny part of a larger universe. It discusses how the Church forbid such talk as herecy and how astronomers overcame that. In other episodes it talks about how different researchers knew each other or mentored each other and that lets you see how ideas grew over generations.

It's all very interesting stuff. But it's not the physics show I thought it was going to be. It's a little light on the science compared to the original series. It doesn't ignore the science. It just doesn't go into deep detail on it. So it will talk about the larger concept of how gravity affects the movement of the planets and how the study of gravity developed, but not a lot of detail on how gravity works.

This isn't a complaint by any means. The historical aspect of the people in science history is absolutely facinating. The whole show is a great look into humanity's past.

All in all it's well worth watching, but watch it for the history of physics and astronomy, not the science of it.",1402444800,12,1228,4.547511312217194

All of the concepts are explained clearly, with jaw-dropping visual aids and clear language. The science is strong and promotes open mindedness. Even the most controversial topics are approached with overwhelming crystal clear evidence. You would have to be willfully ignorant to think this show has anything to do I with political beliefs.

6301938,4,B00IWULSTC,"Neil is a good choice for a new Cosmos.  He learned and knew Carl Sagan at first hand.  I was skeptical of why they should do this actually. In the end, I was right; the new cosmos can only bring more historical details that Carl Sagan couldn't get to.  And, Neil Tyson can't get through everything either, as shown by the fact that he doesn't cover some of the great things Carl Sagan shows.

Carl Sagan's Cosmos was not that great in terms of physics and cosmology.  I suppose the treatment of how stars operate can't get beyond the basics because to do so requires programming computers.  The original insights were confirmed by those working on the same computers that worked on the hydrogen bomb(not just the original atomic bomb, a fission bomb, but a hydrogen bomg is a fusion bomb; and, of course, fusion is the core reaction of how stars work).  On the life science side, I'm once again a little bit disappointed.  Carl Sagan started by a great finding about Chinese crabs; Neil's didn't really improve on this.  He did something great about how the real science of the eye is a major sticking point for creationists(you know they'll never accept this).  Maybe, I don't remember all the science Neil points out, but seems to me that Neil's new Cosmos is mostly giving new historical things and hence new scientific morals.

Neil's knew historical details are great at times; mostly about Isaac Newton and Halley.  I keep thinking that he got this by the new biography of Isaac Newton by James Gleick(who became famous by his first book about Chaos theory).  I haven't read James Gleick's book about Isaac Newton, but I'm sure it's good; I have read his Chaos theory book many times.  Where there hasn't been such a major new work at James Gleick's chaos, Neil's new historical details are not that great and new in my opinion.

While Carl Sagan's also found a great book that allowed him to make two essential episodes(episode 3 and 7, about Kepler and the Greeks respectively), just like Neil found James Gleick's book on Isaac Newton I suspect, Carl Sagan made an improvement on Arthur Koestler's ""Sleepwalkers.""  Carl Sagan found an odd omission of Democritus.  Carl Sagan also made some great literature about fire, which he only gives some of it in episode 7 about the Greeks. Democritus didn't believe in god in quite the same way as Plato, and so Plato and other Pythagorean descendents of the time tried to wright him out of the history records. But, in criticizing him, they typicaly allowed someone like Carl Sagan to decode what happened historically.

- other value of Carl Sagan and now Neil Tyson's Cosmos is that of making videos of what science has shown of the human adventure.

The amount of great science documentaries is pretty low. There's of course Carl Sagan's Cosmos and now Neil's new Cosmos. Before Carl Sagan's Cosmos, there was Jacob Bronowski's Ascent of Man(1974). And even James Burke's Connections was broadcast in 1978. Jacob Bronowski's documentary covered from Australopithacines to Cave painters to the agricultural revolution(episode 2). I don't want to wright much more about Jacob Bronowski's account of the scientific awakening of mankind here. James Burke mostly covers the fall of the Roman empire and events of the Medieval Europe that led to the industrial revolution.  Carl Sagan makes a great episode about what's generally considered the classical Greeks(the Greek history is a bit more complex; but the classical Greek period can be split between pre-Athenian city states and pirates to Athens; Carl Sagan doesn't really go into Athenian events).

My point is that all these scientific humanist videos covers different periods and so they all have their value.  Question is what hasnen't been covered?",1402358400,11,3758,4.894321766561514
6301939,2,B00IWULSTC,"Dr. DeGrasse -Tyson becomes very tiresome.  He has a tendecy to try to create too much enthusiam with his style ... great for kids or maybe in limited amounts of him.  Yes the graphcs were awful.  Not always a fan of Sagan's monotone delivery but better than Tyson.

If you haven't seen it, what the heck are you waiting for? The price is very modest for this 13 part (plus extras) series. A stunning and movingly crafted history of how we came to be here and the great brilliance, courage, sacrifice and cost of how we came to figure so much of it out.

Decades ago Carl Sagan helped stoke the fire in the heart of a young man already dedicated to exploring the cosmos, and that young man, Neil Degrasse Tyson, has always shown himself to be Carl's worthy successor. Never more so than in this moving series. Working with Carl's widow and original 'Cosmos' collaborator, Ann Druyan, this new 'Cosmos' series hosted by Tyson is the perfect bookend to that classic series.",1402358400,12,828,4.594594594594595

Neil Degrasse Tyson takes you on an impeccable adventure along a spacecraft he coins as ""the ship of the imagination,"" which can take you anywhere in space and time. Throughout the series, he shows you around the universe (with respect to the past, present, and future). We encounter a wide variety of objects, from atoms, to black holes.

The last episode in particular (which aired earlier tonight) was particularly good in how it repeatedly bashed religion without ever mentioning religion by name.  What Tyson said toward the end was true and perhaps the main point of the series: don't believe what anyone says, even him... go and find out for yourself (or something to that effect).  Read. Think logically.  Just because you want something to be true does not mean that it is true.  I'm not sure how many times I would care to re-watch the series.  For me, it wasn't that type of program.

The storyline is like a symphony, slowly building to a great climax then bringing us down lightly only to take us into new direction.
The graphics and animation is incredible! The music helps convey the wonder that was so important in the original series as well as this one. The opening title sequence reduces me to tears its so beautiful. Through the animation we get to see what life was like for Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and many other scientists. Of course my favorite episode is ""Sisters of the Sun,"" all about a group of women researchers under Edward Charles Pickering's mentorship that cataloged the stars.
I thought I would hate the episode on Climate Change, ""The World Set Free,"" as it is a topic that makes me very angry yet depressed. Yet this show is so magical the episode left me feeling hopeful that our species will have the fortitude to overcome this issue.

Neil Degrasse Tyson is a master narrator; using stunning special effects, very easy to understand analogies and an obvious love and passion for the subject to grant the viewer an accelerated insight into complex scientific fact and theory. The journeys you go on, watching the show, are a perfect marriage of science and storytelling, ending in a grand wonderment of the universe we live in. The show also pays high homage to those exceptional men and women that made all of these fantastic achievements, giving inspiration to the up and coming visionaries of the future.

They all talk about reading the Bible for ""actual information"" or how childish the animation was - completely unsound reasons. The only valid bad review is the one saying he was expecting an Astronomy show and it is definitively not an astronomy show, so under that situation I can understand the rating. But for everybody else that is not looking for an astronomy-only focused show, I highly recommend this series. Not only it presents the evidence supporting the science claims, it presents the history behind it - actual, documented history. I'm so glad it was showed in mainstream TV, to reach as much people as possible. It is entertaining even to experts, but the main audience are the nonexperts, and it is done in a way that people of all ages can follow and understand it (so I completely like the animated scenes, as kids will enjoy them and learn from it at the same time).",1401494400,13,963,4.572254335260116

What I mean by this is that he makes too many faulty, uncritical claims about the nature of the scientific enterprise and its ontological implications; that he strays too much beyond the bounds of his expertise.

6301966,5,B00IWULSTC,"I'll begin by saying the reason I gave Cosmos a five star is because the content and message of the show delivers nothing but the truth. The truth of our current understanding of ourselves and the universe. The producer, director writers and host were considerate in bringing history and a detailed explanation of each subject matter. This is important fir the audience they are trying to reach, people who are not science savvy and people who have curiosity and skepticism in them. I gave i five star because I would like it to continue to be attractive to future generation, in maybe years from now someone curious might be looking to some science show here on amazon. I would like them to find this show on top, alongside shows like the original Cosmos with Carl Sagan, Wonders of the Universe by Brian Cox and science shows like Into the Wormhole. By Morgan Freeman. I highly recommend it.

My only disappointment is that Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the inspiring people I've known, it seems in this show he was held back by following the producer and script. The Dr Tyson in this show is not the 100%, in terms of his wit, passionate opinions and powerful deliveries. Try searching for his speech and talks in youtube, he is completely different. Somehow the producer, writers and director of this show missed on an opportunity on unleashing the real Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, it would have been hell of a show.",1401321600,37,1416,4.664
6301967,5,B00IWULSTC,"I worried at first that this series would only re-present the Sagan program with up-dated information. There had already been such a set of the Cosmos series released, so I feared that this might be a fairly dull re-hashing of what we, the lovers of the original series, had already seen. I'm sure that most people who watch this series keep up fairly well with modern advances in scientific discovery, so another run-through of the original series with minor upgrades to the facts would have been almost unnecessary.  I was pleasantly surprised that the series has been re-imagined to include the work of lesser-known scientific researchers. Rather than disliking the animated interludes, I find them delightful. They've modernized Cosmos without ignoring some of the delights of the original, including the ship that can travel anywhere and see things at every scale. I notice that the set has been re-named Season One.....I'm hoping  this means if  the ratings are sufficient then this will only be the first of many examinations of the frontiers of the scientific knowledge.

6301968,4,B00IWULSTC,"Amazing, the special effects and the host, Dr. Neil deGrausse Tyson. The cartoons drag on a bit too much compared to how material was presented by Dr. Carl Sagan, so many years ago. The subject matter visits many science disciplines, and is not bent on astronomy/astrophysics, as much as I would prefer. The music pales in comparison, too; but it works for me. Other than that, to me, some of the material drags a bit; and seems melodramatic. Even my father, the one responsible for my documentary addiction, said the first few episodes were boring. Overall, and once up to speed, I have found this series to be one of my favorites. I'd say watch a few episodes before you buy, because we have so many choices today. I give this series an B+.

Further comparisons between Cosmos of today and the Cosmos of the '70's/80's- Graphics overall are better today, yet the older one's were effective enough. A+. The cartoons I already mentioned, dialogue and animation; whereas Dr. Sagan often visited a set/location (rendered or real) and told the story on-camera. B. The music is neither intrusive nor awful; to me, it pales in comparison to the eerie electronic, gorgeous classical, and mixed-bag of traditional sounding fare of the original.

I have rarely given a one-star review, and it would have been a zero-star review if that had been possible.

I was so disappointed with this series.  Perhaps it was because I was so profoundly affected by the Carl Sagan series and nothing could ever compare to it.  The Odyssey is littered with pro-AGW sentiment, which turned me off instantly.  What happened to the cosmos, the universe, quantum physics?  All of the fascinating advances in our knowledge since Dr. Sagan left us.  I wouldn't be so judgmental of Odyssey if the producers had been honest about it and gave the series a name more appropriate - something like:  ""Earth:  An Odyssey"".

6301984,5,B00IWULSTC,"I grew up a child of the 80's, with a fascination for the twinkling lights in the night sky above me.  I read what I could from my elementary school's library, but a lot of it didn't come together in a complete picture until Cosmos opened that door and made me better understand our place in the grand scheme of everything.

If you are looking for hard science and numbers, this isn't where you should be looking.  There are text books and hard documentaries a-plenty on public television.  This show however is a great primer for those who are looking at an easy way to introduce a younger audience to the wonders of science, nature, and human history as it relates to our place in the universe.  If watched with said younger audience, it would certainly help to spark questions that perhaps would get them to think a little more about the bigger world around them.

Even if you are someone who already has a firm grasp of the cosmos at large, there is a lot to appreciate in some of its history and nature lessons which even I found, while perhaps not profoundly educational, a good refresher and still managed to learn a thing or two about some key people and events.  Can most people honestly claim to know everything about Ibn al-Haytham, tardigrades, or Marie Tharp?

A direct comparison with the original 1980 broadcast of this voice of the universe is inevitable, however Neil deGrasse Tyson is no Carl Sagan and Alan Silvestri is no Vangelis.  I do not mean to say that Neil and Alan are in some way lessers of Carl and Vangelis, but rather, their purpose is a little bit different.

The original Cosmos had a musical quality about its presentation with Carl Sagan as its vocals, a delivery I describe as being a heart moving experience that makes you think.  Listening to the music and hearing Carl's own written words from his seminal work is something to be personally felt to understand.  But there is a certain nostalgia to the sensation that may be a bit passe for some younger generations.

Cosmos 2014 however has a more direct, practical approach to its delivery.  It's not trying to tug at those same emotional notes right off the bat and it's certainly not trying to capture the magic the same way and I greatly appreciate that.  It does connect to the original series on a personal level (Neil deGrasse Tyson's first meeting with Carl Sagan)  and uses some of the same imagery from time to time (Ship of the Imagination, the opening cliffside scene, the cosmic calendar).  Various topics about the age of the universe, nature, and science are covered in its own informative but not too heavy way, which is again perfect for a general audience, providing enough general answers but leaving plenty of room for independent discovery for the curious.

The musical score too is not as heavy was it was in the original series, accompaying the narrative without being very emotional except maybe in a few key moments when it wants to be.  It is somewhat repetitive however, which is fine since it's not trying to carry the series.

This is definitely not the same Cosmos of yesteryear.  But it does not try to be, which is perfectly fine by me.  Perhaps some day soon when my nephews finally look up at the night sky and can ask me what those twinkling lights are, I'll let them decide which approach to the Cosmos they prefer.

(There IS a series out there that has a much more ""Cosmos 1980"" feel that was done in very recent years, which I also deeply appreciate, but out of deference to this series I will not mention directly in this review.)",1399507200,41,3560,4.589257503949447

6301986,5,B00IWULSTC,The TV series is dazzling--except for the commercials.  I counted 30 in one hour. I will buy the DVD for my grandson if someone can promise that the commercials are out of it.  Tyson is a brilliant communicator as well as astrophysicist.,1399420800,9,237,4.619047619047619
6301987,4,B00IWULSTC,"Tyson is great, the production is great.  The visuals are stunning, but the only negative is that the broadcast had commercials every ten minutes.  It should have been broadcasted on PBS as the original COSMOS was but since Seth Macfarlane has ties to FOX, I guess he shopped it there first.  This kind of brings it more into commercial television which lessens the amount of minutes of the broadcast.  I am hoping the DVD makes up with extended episode minutes.

Glad to see that Ann Druyan was again an integral part of the production.

It's difficult not to make a comparison to Sagan here, but I really tried not to.  Although many of the general themes are the same as the original, the presentation and visuals are quite different and much more elaborate.  I had been concerned initially that the use of CGI would compete as it so often does in mainstream movies these days, but they compliment this series rather than take over in my opinion. Tyson and Sagan are different, but both are World Science teachers and both respected.  Tyson has the knowledge, insight into the topics discussed as well as charisma and the childlike wonder we all loved in Sagan.  Sagan can't be replaced, but keep an open mind here if you had like myself watched the original Cosmos.

I enjoyed the animations that really brought some of the scientists stories to life, especially Newton, Faraday just to name a few.
Also the topic of the Cosmic Perspective, Hall of Extinction, and again the Cosmic Calendar, gave a good reminder of just how short our lives are compared to the billions of years of cosmic events.

Tyson has a whole new generation of fans and he is as great of a teacher and Mentor as Sagan :)",1397520000,38,1697,4.62
6301988,5,B00IWULSTC,"I heard about this project a year ago and have been waiting patiently for its release. Being spearheaded by Neil Degrasse Tyson, Ann Druyan, and Seth Macfarlane, I knew this show was in good hands:

Tyson is one of the most famous astrophysicists alive. His involvement in NOVA and his podcast 'Startalk' have made him a rockstar among the scientific-literate youth. Ann Druyan (who co-wrote the original Cosmos) helped produce and write this revamp. Seth Macfarlane, better known for starting the show Family Guy, it seems has always been interested in science...this revamped version of Cosmos came about when Seth ran into Tyson at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences. Who woulda thought?

Now onto the show:

In the first episode, you are invited aboard the Ship of the Imagination. It's a sleek vessel that allows Tyson and the viewer to go anywhere: from the edge of the universe to the nucleus of an atom. It's a fantastic way to get to the places that Tyson is describing in the narration.

The cinematography is jaw dropping. 3D renderings of galaxies, nebulae, asteroid fields, atoms, storms on Jupiter, etc are scattered throughout each show...and they look 100% real. There are moments where animated cartoons are used, usually representing a story about past scientists or philosophers...I thought the cartoon animations would detract from the shows grandeur, but that doesn't seem to be the case - the animations are beautiful and tasteful.

The music score, by Alan Silvestri, is perfect for this series. Silvestri has scored soundtracks for movies like Contact, Castaway, Forrest Gump...and for Cosmos he has used his talent to create yet another fantastic score. It gives the show a perfect sound to go along with the visuals...you'll see (hear) this in the first episode when you take a tour of the universe.

The science is mind-blowing. Neil Degrasse Tyson clearly talks you through each scientific tidbit, allowing even the youngest developing minds to understand intricate ideas, theories, and laws. Most who graduated high school (and college) will already know about most of the science talked about in this show, but this is a great refresher.

In addition to making it easy for you to understand the science, Tyson urges the viewer to continue the charge of the scientific revolution. He makes it clear that ANY viewer could be the next Einstein, Darwin, or Newton...it just takes one spark of inspiration and the next great idea will be born.

Cosmos is one of the most important television shows to ever grace the airwaves. No doubt it will inspire teachers to educate more clearly, inspire students to learn, and allow everyone to appreciate the vast beauty and complexity of the universe we live in.

As the show goes on, I will continue to update this post with my likes and possible dislikes (though I doubt I'll find anything I dislike). I will also update my post when the Blu-ray is released. For now, I just want everyone to know how great this show is.

BLU RAY REVIEW:

The picture and audio quality is mindblowing - every little star is noticeable, even the smallest bacterium is full of detail. This is the quality I expect from blu-ray, but this detail also spotlights the care and precision that went into this show (the special effects mirror that of a high-budget Hollywood film).

The audio is crisp and deep. If you have a sound system, definitely use it when watching Cosmos.

The packaging is great (even has a little Cosmic Calender printed on an inside flap). The menu screen is slightly difficult to navigate - the words on the screen are very small (I have near perfect vision and I have to squint to read the show titles on my 42"" television).

My main gripe with this release is that it didn't come with a digital copy (even one that we could download from the web). This is a show I'd love to have on my tablet, but I'm more or less confined to just watching it at home now.

Regardless, if you have a blu-ray player and are remotely interested in Cosmos, it's worth the plunge. Never before has a show brought me to such an emotional level: Cosmos isn't just about science, it's also about the grandeur of the universe. And in blu-ray, it's like having a front row seat to all that is, was, and ever will be.

The Army paid for some of my college and the Navy paid for some of my husband's.

I sure hope this makes many understand how beautiful and fascinating and astounding our universe truly is. Paraphrasing Einstein: 'our problems cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which they were created.' I would say it's nearly impossible to  begin with so many people lacking basic scientific literacy. A million times thank you to Druyan, Tyson, MacFarlane, of course Sagan, and everyone else who made this happen.",1396310400,306,890,5.283687943262412
6301993,5,B00IWULSTC,"The best science show on TV ever! Yes, the show is basic and has some animation. No, the show was not made for ""solid undergraduate liberal arts educated people."" This show is trying to reach out to the greatest audience possible. I saw the original version of the show and even though I loved the information, the presentation put me to sleep. This new version of the show is easy to understand. They are not trying to preach to the converted (me included). Some 80-something % of Americans still believe in god, so a ""dumbing"" down of the material is very necessary. Since most Americans are already ""dumb,"" hopefully this show will teach a wider audience than the original did. Until most people in the world start to believe in REALITY vs MYTHOLOGY, this will continue to be necessary.",1395878400,36,789,4.683453237410072
6301994,5,B00IWULSTC,"I remember with great fondness the first Cosmos and eagerly anticipated this new version.  I am impressed with this remake.  I was really worried, because Fox and science seem like uneasy bedfellows, but so far Neil seems to be running things the way he wants.  A lot of the presentation is so beautiful it should qualify as art.

Although I myself am not learning much new science (but actually a great deal of the history of science) this show is not aimed at scientists.  The show is aimed at the curious, from age 7 to nearly dead.  It is about not only science but really about  the scientific method and the glorious exploration of the world around us.  Along the way, Neil does two things I did not expect.  He outlines a great deal about scientists lives and he takes direct aim at creationist pet ""facts"".  In the first three episodes he has dismantled many creationists favorite ""go to"" arguments.  He systematically outlined the evolution of the eye (this is a big favorite of creationists, who argue the eye is too complex to have evolved), hit on the whole issue of the common ancestors of apes and men, and delineated the age of comets, which does not jive with the young earth view.  And he does it deftly and with not so subtle jabs,  calling the  story of the universe and our place in it the ""greatest story ever told"".  Type that phrase into google, and the entire first page of results are references to Jesus, or movies about Jesus.  Not science.  But Neil seems determined to change that viewpoint.

If you have kids between age 8 and 18, this should be required family viewing.  Unless you are a creationist, if so you better avoid Cosmos because this show will cause your children to ask you uncomfortable questions.",1395792000,334,1740,4.590909090909091

8645875,5,B00IWULSTC,"Scientists have been criticized for not communicating effectively with the general public. Carl Sagan's ambitious 13-part series on the universe and our place in it, ""Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,"" was the first, highly successful TV popularization of the science of astrophysics. No doubt, many scientists today can thank Sagan for the initial spark that ignited their careers. ""Cosmos"" was written by Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan (whom Sagan later married), and Steven Soter; it was presented by Sagan.

In this series, Sagan offered much to learn about mind-blowing discoveries of which most of the USA population is still unaware--nearly four decades after it first lit up TV screens. But he went further, outlining how scientists in the past, with limited tools, developed ingenious methods for supporting their theories (or in some cases, not). So throughout the series, we have this neat alternation between traveling though space on ""the space ship of the imagination""--a trip of discovery--and these short stories on the history of science. And here is my only criticism--the history-of-science portions could come across a bit dry and boring to some viewers.

The series reflected two of Sagan's basic values: wonder and skepticism. If more people in the USA had viewed it in the 1980, perhaps our culture wouldn't be in such a massive mess as it is in today--more people would embrace the wonder of discovery, be thinking critically, and would understand the scientific method. Although Neil DeGrasse Tyson's 2014 series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" was designed as a successor to Sagan's ""Cosmos,"" Tyson took a different approach that was perhaps more entertaining, but in my view, less informative and cohesive.

It is easy to forget that digital recording was not available when this series was produced, nor did high-definition color TV exist as we know it today. The remastering of the series to Blu-ray format, incorporating significant digital improvements, greatly enhances the viewing experience. And the music track featuring several original pieces by Vangelis fits the content perfectly--""Comet 16"" being one of my favorite pieces.",1525478400,,2146,5.362017804154303
