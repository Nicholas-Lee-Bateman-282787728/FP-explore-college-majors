Lovely animation, I recommend using it as an alternative form of meditation, it takes you to higher states. Watch it with an open mind and from the heart.",1355270400,2,325,4.52542372881356

8337389,5,B001R5ESVY,Fantastic journeys (5) communicating the evolvement of Planet Earth and visitations assisting the repair of our energy fields.
