2818703,5,B000PGTPH8,"This show, during the first season was nothing short of spectacular.  The second season tries to pick up on the incredible emotion that ended the first season.  In the new season, Caesar (for fairly obvious reasons) is not the plot moving character, Mark Antony is.  Played by the fantastic James Purefoy, Antony is a tragically flawed, brutal character.  Vorenus also has become a much colder character.  Simon Woods takes over the role of Octavian mid-way through the season.  This happened to demonstrate time lapses, but that was the only slightly sub-par part of the series.  Max Pirkis was much better then Woods, but he is sufficient.  The second season is fantastic, and the only sad part is was that Caesar had to die (Ciaran Hinds was simply AMAZING in season 1).  James Purefoy alone makes the season worth buying.",1178323200,16,825,4.877697841726619
2818740,5,B000PGTPH8,The only thing that I did not like about Rome was that it was too short. I have watched this series more than 20 times. It is that good. It shows historical occurrences but also combines what could have been real life events in the lower classes and the upper classes. It is absolutely fantastic. It is violent at times and there are some graphic sexual content but that just adds to the story. I really wish this had been on for at least 10 years so there be more episodes to watch.,1519171200,2,483,4.204301075268817

My favorite characters in the series were Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus. I was a little unhappy that this was only two seasons. I could have invested myself for at least another two!",1516233600,,448,4.345238095238095

2818762,4,B000PGTPH8,"Not bad, but really long. I found some lengths in this part 2. However, the fact is that the representation of what Rome could be then seems very realistic in terms of clothings, way of living, atmosphere, and landscapes. This series is pretty fascinating because we have been marked for so long by antiquity (just remember your first History book among other examples). Did our societies changed that much after all? We are still in this relationship between the dominant and the dominated, aren't we? Violence, cruelty, sex (no modesty at the time), religion and politic are pretty well represented (or at least what it conform to our imaginary perception of it based on what we saw, read or heard..) and give a good illustration of human gender, all backgrounds confounded. One can see that there were a lot of efforts made to transcript the daily life from Caesar to Octavian's throne access. A lot of researches first probably, but the result is here, and it is a premiere according to me. The story based on historical facts is also interesting even if sometimes it is long, too much nearly. Many of these heroes would have died much earlier in real life. I doubt a guy like Pullo could have done all these campaigns and stay alive, but that is ok. All in all I really recommend it. Details are amazing.",1512950400,,1309,4.670995670995671

2818768,2,B000PGTPH8,"Idiotic over-sped/simplified cookie-cutter cartoonish buffoonery full of plot holes and historic inaccuracies.

Let me give you an example:

I complained that HBO Romes portrayal of the Battle of Pharsalus as a 5-second blurry montage. Now, having seen season 2s portrayal of the Battle of Philippi, I only wish the latter was a blurry montage. I am trying to understand what was the thinking of whoever was in charge of producing that idiocy.

What happened in real life:

Battle day 1:

Mark Anthony + Octavian vs. Brutus + Cassius. The two forces arrange themselves in defensive positions and try to lure each other out of them. Not being idiots, each side refuses to be goaded. Then Mark Anthony attempts to secretly flank Cassius by moving his forces through a marsh. Cassius realizes too late, responds with too few forces, his army is destroyed.

Meanwhile, Brutuss troops are tired of his cautious approach. This attitude will bite him in the butt later, but today it wins him the battle. They decide to just wing it and storm Octavians position. Their unplanned attack catches Octavians forces by surprise, and they're destroyed. Octavian craps his pants while hiding in a swamp (true story).

So, technically its a draw. Except Cassius doesnt realize what happened on Brutuss side (that the latter won) and, thinking that Brutus was killed, commits suicide. Pretty much the rest of the history of the Western world is arguably strongly influenced by this one mistake.

What follows is 20 days during which Brutus builds fortifications making it impossible for Mark Anthony and Octavian to charge his position. Two sides maneuver against each other in positional warfare reminiscent of WWI (or US Civil War). Brutus's fleet intercepts Anthonys reinforcements and destroys them. MA and Octavian are about to starve.

But, the troops don't respect Brutus (the less respected commander comparing to the now-dead Cassius) and take his positional tactics for cowardice. They force him to charge Mark Anthonys lines, and his army is predictably destroyed. (The same happened to Pompey vs. Caesar btw.) He commits a suicide, and the Republic is dead with him. This is pretty similar to how Southern generals were mistrustful of Robert E. Lees and Longstreets positional warfare, eventually forcing them to commit Pickets Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg, losing the war.

I mean, this is an awesome battle. You have tactics, strategy, human emotion, chance and luck, etc. You can make a whole movie about it alone, like they did with Gettysburg.

HBO Romes version:

The two armies stupidly clash against each other, head-on. Chaos ensues. Mark Anthony is sitting on a horse eating a loaf of bread. Octavian asks: Whats going on? Anthony answers: No idea. Throws away bread and decides to charge with his cavalry, explaining: When in doubt, attack. Octavian doesnt want to charge, but, seeing his buddy Agrippas sour look, says, Whatever. Go ahead. Agrippa and two other horsemen (!) charge.

Meanwhile, Cassius is being pierced by arrows in a turtle formation. Then he decides for some reason to just charge a cloud of dust. He is brought, dying, to Brutus. When asked What happened, he says, You know, I am not sure, and dies. Brutus takes off his armor and charges against the attacking line of soldiers, being stabbed to death, Julius Caesarstyle.

Now, tell me: who came up with this idiocy? Showing *nothing* is better than showing this. Showing an excerpt from Shakespeares Julius Caesar would be better. Replacing the two sides with Japanese samurai and Vikings would be more realistic than what HBO came up with.",1510617600,,3629,5.056951423785595

2818783,3,B000PGTPH8,"One of the better history-themed series in recent TV. But I did worry about the writing at the end of season 1 when they rushed Caesar's demise, and the writing in season 2 does come down a peg or two. The storylines are less suspenseful than in the first season, and not woven together as nicely. By midseason it was feeling a bit like a soap opera set in ancient Rome, and I began to lose interest in who was sleeping with whom, who was betraying whom, etc. Still, though not as good as season 1, it pulled itself together often enough to keep me watching to the end.",1506297600,,569,4.229357798165138

2818788,4,B000PGTPH8,It's a shame that the series ended after season 2 because I feel things were just starting to get warmed up.

There is evidence that all this stuff is as old as the Romans, but no evidence,  as far as my fellow scholars know as well as I myself are aware of, that Octavian, for example, habitually beat his sexual partners for his own sexual pleasure, as the screenplay here has him say. While it's no surprise that a made-for-HBO Television programme ramps up the frequent gratuitous violence and vigilante thug justice in a show, I was thinking it would have been just as easy for the same care to get historical details right in costuming and props (which is done pretty well here) would be applied to probable dialog and characters instead of the extreme liberties taken with made-up character traits of well known historical figures such as Attia, Octavian, and, Brutus. Probably if I knew less about actual Roman history, I would enjoy the show a little more.

2818926,5,B000PGTPH8,"As good as the first season, though from a slightly different angle, with Marcus and Titas really coming into their own. James Purefoy just chews up the scenery whenever he's on screen and even Livia is forced to concede precedence to Attia.

An added bonus to this series is that when it ends, you can move directly forward some 20 not too terribly noteworthy years and begin watching ""I, Claudius"" which takes the story of the early Empire from there.",1484697600,,453,4.6625

This is an accurately detailed show with lots of attention to details of ancient Rome so that you will get a great sense of the marvelous achievements of the Romans.  The show is fairly historically accurate too so that you meet many of the major players in Roman history from its Golden Era and afterwards into its decline.  The tragedies and ironies of these Roman lives couldn't be better written in a fictional novel.  Of course, some details that were unknown were filled in by the shows writers.  However, I have to hand it to the writers and the entire crew of this show for doing such a great job of bringing Ancient Rome and these characters to life in an exceptional show.

Best female (Attia), best bromance, best romance (vorenus) and Marc Antony is right up there with Al Swearengen, Marlo Stanfield and Phil Leotardo for best antagonist.

This is totally my opinion but it also seems the series forms a perfect television trilogy: Pompey vs. Caesar (1.1 - 1.8); King Caesar and Consul Antony's brief rule (1.9 - 2.3); the rise of First Citizen Augustus (2.4 - 2.10)",1481846400,,544,4.849462365591398

""They're just Servila's minions, this is all her doing."" - Atia

Four EPIC Stars. In Season 2 of the very-expensive, HBO/BBC TV series, ""Rome"", the producers continue to present their storylines set against the general historical backdrop of people, nations, major events, the culture, and architecture of the era. They present rivalries, friendships, internal intrigue, competing families, warring armies, and amorous relationships. The imaginatively-depicted, very carnal, capital city of Rome is the center piece location of the story although the storyline goes as far afield, location-wise, as Egypt, as expected. The costly mini-series ran for two seasons, was shot on an enormous series of sets, and was cancelled, although many fans wanted a third season. Season 1 was rumored to cost $100Million. The first three seasons shot were cut down to two, losing some historical flow, because of the historically knowledgeable British audience. Some shortcomings are: the actors are not too 'Roman' in appearance and the battles are certainly not epic, as the producers get right to the point of who won and who lost each battle and move quickly to the aftermaths.

In Season 1, it was Caesar versus Pompey as rivals for control of the Roman empire with a great deal of political maneuvering going on among the members of the Senate, the competing families, friends, enemies, soldiers, and citizens. Then at the end of S-1, Caesar is murdered in the Senate by Brutus and cohorts. The trials, tribulations, and complex friendship of two fictional soldiers, Vorenus and Pullo, continue as Vorenus makes a terrible decision after his wife's death in S1. The fortunes of four families continue to be followed as political and social situations arise across the city.  The power struggle between Servila and Atia and their families affects all of Rome and some of the known world at the time. There is one very unique character transformation as two actors play one role. All heading towards a monumental end with the depiction of the fate of two unlikely competitors and the ultimate winner of everything. Produced by William J. Macdonald, John Milius, and Bruno Heller. This is a forerunner of the ""Game of Thrones"" big-scale types of historical TV epics. Starring an outstanding cast of Kevin McKidd, Ray Stevenson, Simon Woods, Polly Walker, James Purefoy, Kerry Condon, Max Pirkis, Tobias Menzies, Indira Varma, Lindsay Duncan, and more. Carnality, profanity, violence. Four IMPERIAL Stars. (An HBO/ BBC production. Rated TV-MA. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray. 10-one hour episodes.)",1480550400,4,2576,5.247572815533981

Most of this story is true and based on fact, and this series skillfully shows the ruthless and cunning moves behind grasps for power and money in ancient Rome.  Acting in this series is superb as real life historical figures are brought to light with all their flaws and a few strengths (flaws are far more interesting)!!!

The last few episodes of season 2 are epic!  But it does drag a little bit in the middle of the season.  Keep watching though, its worth it.  And even the ""weaker shows"" in the middle of the season are still very good television!  Every episode of this show is very, very good.  Its just some are better than others, and the middle of season 2 is slightly less good.

Season 1, on the other hand, is magnificent throughout.  Plus season 1 and season 2 tell very seperate stories.  So I say, just start with season 2, then go back and watch season one.  It's the best way to watch the show.",1478908800,7,796,4.268456375838926

Not only that, but I showed it to my grandparents, and they ended up loving it too, and I bought them the DVDs, and now they've watched it countless times as well.

In season 1 he seemed more engaged with those around him and was more passionate about Rome itself. In season 2 he is rather aloof and calculating; more concerned about being imperial. Overall, though, it was a well produced series. I could have done without some of the gratuitous sex and violence, however.",1474243200,,432,4.851351351351352

One of the best things EVER from HBO or on TV generally",1471392000,,146,3.9
2820622,5,B000PGTPH8,Great Show !!! Series should have run longer.,1471392000,,45,4.75
2820623,5,B000PGTPH8,"Authentic, moving and great moral intelligence. Much, much better than any other historical drama about Rome that I have seen. Season 1 is amazing! For me, while it is not quite as miraculously good and powerful as 2001, Barry Lyndon, or In the Mood for Love (a few of my absolute all-time favorites), it is really only just a hair off. I am still surprised that something this good got made.

The sets are gorgeous. They also incorporate a great deal of scholarly details about Rome. Having been to Rome and being someone who is fascinated about ancient Rome, seeing the sets are a real treat.

The best choice made by the show (I assume it is the script writer's) is to focus on two ordinary Roman soldiers who are brave, reasonably good
and very relate-able.  The problem I have had with all the other Roman historical dramas is that the central, powerful characters are all really unsympathetic to me because they seem like power-mad bastards.  Probably they were a lot worse.  But even after the script writers have done their best to soft soap the central characters what was true is still detectable.  As a result I really couldn't care who gets whom and usually got bored stiff.

By placing Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus at the center, the show manages to go on with a big heart and a high level of moral intelligence.  That contrasts with the power struggles and makes the historical characters and goings-on more compelling.  I imagine that the director Michael Apted had a lot to do with the great sense of decency, that way of splitting the attention between the great and the little, without doing disservice to either,  that undergirds the show and makes it so wonderful.

** Spoiler**
One small example:  Julius Caesar asks the Egyptians to impale two heads of his enemies on the palace gate.  While a conventional show might have simply shown the heads on the spikes overlooking the gates to conclude the episode.  Michael Apted shows 5 Roman soldiers go outside the gate. Two climb onto the shoulders of two others who stand beneath them. The fifth then tosses the heads successively to the soldiers at the top, so that the heads can get impaled correctly.  All this is done in a practiced, matter-of-fact, ""we do a good job come what may"" fashion.  And it really makes you think... we think the powerful are what matters, but where would they be without the little guys, the soldiers, who actually do the head impaling and do it correctly?  What did the soldiers tell themselves about their day jobs.  Did they think it was fun? Or did they not like it because it takes forever to wash the blood off because the soap in Egypt is no good? Did they get trained in head paling?  It is just wonderful to be prompted to think about all these ordinary people who made the historical events possible.

P.S.
For me, the show worked best when it sticks close to the historical account.  I thought Octavia was the weakest character, because they essentially made her up.  But there was a real Octavia and she was utterly different from the show's depiction.  The historical Octavia (not Mark Anthony) had Cicero's hands, head and tongue pinned up on the senate house door because Cicero spoke out (and published speeches) against Anthony.  Once you know that, it is hard to accept the show's Octavia.  Atia appears to be a composite of other conniving Roman women described in the historical record, not the real Atia of whom we know next to nothing, so that worked okay for me.

The show, inexplicably to my mind, skips some very juicy historical details. For example, one historical source said that, during the 9 months or so Julius Caesar spent in Egypt, he was ""every man's woman and every woman's man."" (Caesar, being a patrician Roman, practiced Greek mores, which were considerably more relaxed than the stricter heterosexual mores of today.)  I would have enjoyed seeing a brief montage featuring the incomparable Ciara Hinds on this theme.  And I imagine it would have done wonders for the show's ratings.  Alas, nothing.

Another example, Octavius, or Caesar Augustus, was such a horrid thug during the civil wars that in one instance he plucked the eye balls out of one of his opponents.  I thought the show was foreshadowing this episode by showing the young Octavius beating a subdued enemy to death during episode 1.  But it seems to have ran out of time during season 2 and skipped that.  That left Octavius entirely too angelic looking.

Finally, some histories say the Roman legions sometimes marched while singing lurid and lewd songs about their Generals.  Sulla's soldiers marched while singing about Sulla having one testicle. (He in fact had two but allowed the song to show he had a sense of humor and was a good chap.)  Caesar's sang about his male (and female) sexual partners.  I always liked these stories.  To me, they explain a lot about how the Roman legions were so successful for so long. The soldiers were perfectly willing to die upon command, even commands they don't understand or agree with, but they were also totally at ease publicly making fun of their commander's personal life (not his competence to command). I understand one cannot show this kind of detail in a Hollywood movie or in an ABC show, but on HBO... that would have been perfect! Alas, nothing.

Mostly though, I just wish someone would restart the show, get the old team back, and let them make more of it.  Season 2 was too compressed.  There is a lot of Roman history. And I for one would be happy to pay to see all of it, both before and after the Gallic wars, if it is done by this team.",1471305600,2,5607,4.663275686673448

2820817,4,B000PGTPH8,"This is the second season of the TV show ROME that I've watched, and feel it is as good as the first season. There's a bit of transition in characters between season 1 and 2. That's because one of the main characters in season 1, Gauis Julius Ceasar, is murdered in the Roman Senate. This is not a spoiler alert, as this fact is well-document in all of the Roman history books I've read over the years. One of the great things about this TV show is that it's faithful to the actual historical facts of what happened in Ancient Rome, circa 1 A.D. Julius Ceasar's role as head of the Roman Republic is turned over to his odopted son (his nephew) Ocatavian Ceasar. You start to see the young Octavian (he's in his early 20's) mature into the Roman Emperor Augustus, the official name he took on later in his term as ruler of Rome. Excellent casting throughtout, in particular the beautiful but always scheming Attia (Octavian's mother). Several other characters that are very well portrayed are the Roman Centurian and the Roman soldier throught which we see most of the action.

All in all a very engaging slice of history, although some of the minor characters had a few weaknesses: too much time spent on Attia for example. But the major characters were very well portrayed. Anthony was very well acted and believable, although I would have liked to have seen his first wife. Octavian was brilliant, cunning, and lethal as he was in history. The only faulty portrayal was Cleopatra; she was much more capable and intelligent in reality. The character here was dull and manipulative. However, all things considered the series had many episodes and showed the times and the people extremely well. I wish there were more series of this caliber available.

I highly recommend it to all that like historical drama--for this series offers the best any drama can offer: another time's take on life and ambition in a most matter-of-fact manner that maybe reflects the sanguine minds and lives of these Romans portrayed.  The lives of Pullo and Vorenus and their ultimate fidelity to their Roman leaders reflects what the shows makers wanted to portray: a time when loyalty meant everything to the greatness that was Rome. And the greater tragedy that Mark Antony did not realize he owed his allegiance to Rome, not Egypt.",1469232000,,703,4.899159663865547

2821431,4,B000PGTPH8,"I will be the first to admit that I know little about this era in history other than what I have watched in films and TV. I've seen history slaughtered in miniseries of this sort so I understand the distain the history buffs would have.  However, I found the series to be very entertaining. The actors who played Pullo and Vorenus played off each other brilliantly. There really were two centurions in the Roman army who went by that name and also garnered fame from an event that displayed their heroism and gallantry, much like in the series. However, these two characters took on a life of their own and added much to the overall presentation.

In fact, all the characters were vastly interesting, even with the lack of any historical accuracy. The setting was very well done and I believe there was an attempt to show life as it was then given what is available to us through archeological record and written history. Yes, there were liberties taken even here but it worked for this series.

I didn't find it it slow at all but I wish there had been less ""over-the-top"" bloody violence. I spent a good deal of time covering my eyes until my boyfriend gave me the ""all clear"".",1464825600,2,1179,4.525821596244131

2821489,4,B000PGTPH8,"For a tv show, the series Rome was way above the usual tripe (as most of the Sunday night HBO shows have been). I found it interesting how the actor who played Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds, I think his name was) even looks like contemporary busts of the real Caesar.

They did play around with some facts for the series, but then again, it was a fictional series- still, it was about 90% accurate, so the producers did a pretty good job balancing history with entertainment. Besides, there's always some history geek like myself who'll quibble about that anyway, so they may as well give it a try.

The only thing I did not like in this series was how they handled Lucius Vorenus and his whole self loathing act and how it affected his ruling of the Palatine. It was a worthwhile sub plot to follow, but how it was presented just didn't feel real to me. I did like, however, how both the Vorenus and Pullo characters were named from Caesar's book on his conquest of Gaul: they were the only 2 legionnaires whose names were mentioned. Stuff like that makes this history geek warm all over.

So anyway, if you're interested in watching an entertaining series, Rome certainly maintained HBO's streak of excellent Sunday night viewing, and was even reasonably accurate historically as well. Vorenus may not have been believable during the second season, but it didn't lessen my appreciation of the overall story so much that I wouldn't recommend Rome as a show worth watching.",1464480000,5,1471,4.671814671814672

I have to admit, I was very shocked at the graphics and sex scenes - almost soft porn.  Season 2 was even more graphic and sexual and found myself moving the cursor forward because it was getting a little obscene.  The story line and acting, however, is superb and I enjoyed that.  Alan Leech (who played Branson the chauffeur on Downton Abbey) was the rough and tough general, Agrippa in this series.  That would be the only character I thought was not cast correctly.  Alan Leech is a great actor, but somehow with his innocent baby face, he did not fit the part of Agrippa to me at all.  All-in-all, it was a good series but I thought the graphics and sex scenes were a little too shocking for my taste.",1463184000,,840,4.312101910828026

One of the most amazing times is human history in a thrilling, action packed, intense mini-series.

It is not completely historically accurate - get over it history nerds.

Never the less it it is very accurate from a high level perspective (Caesar did defeat Gaul, Caesar was stabbed on the Senate Floor,, Marc Antony was opposed to Octavian, Marc and Cleopatra were in love, etc). The dialogue and specifics were of course made up.

It also brings into view the raw day to day life of a an average Roman, and the stark difference of the nobility day to day. The brutality of Rome is accurately depicted.

One of the best shows you will see.",1462406400,,652,4.586206896551724

Wish they had received 5 years to do that long Roman era even more justice.",1461715200,,243,4.239130434782608
2821895,4,B000PGTPH8,4 1/2 star. Really enjoy learning the history and politics plus seeing how people lived during that time.

Pullo and Vorenus weren't always credible, popping up so conveniently when needed. However, Rome Season 2, in my view had  more effective drama than season 1. However, as a series, a very fine historic presentation. More than 2 seasons would have spoiled the its effect. One amusing feature, most key, upper class actors spoke fine English,  whereas the plebs were lower class in their speech.",1461715200,,541,4.934065934065934

It moves much faster than the first season- time wise. I suggest watching it on DVD with the pop-up information about the history of the events.

2822075,5,B000PGTPH8,"Superb series, and it just kept getting better and better as we fell in love with each of the characters. (Or fell in love with despising them!) I was sad to see it end so soon.

The casting was perfect. I fell in love with Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson for the first time watching this series. The friendship and love portrayed by these two as ""brothers"" is gut-wrenching at times. But the writers and actors did a great job of fleshing out the characters so that the bit of dry humor and wit wasn't lost on us. I found myself smiling or laughing when I least expected it.

Even though I have seen the two main actors in other great shows such as Dexter and Grey's Anatomy, I will always love and
remember them best in ""Rome.""

Side note: This IS historical fiction, portraying Rome in a time period when violence and sex were prolific. Not meant for children.",1459382400,,862,4.375

2822151,4,B000PGTPH8,"Good story telling blend of violence, nudity and sex against a somewhat historical background. Despite some scenes depicting women enjoying sex and dope, the lives of most women in Roman society were bleak in the free will department. Even ladies in the upper ranks of society skilled at manipulating their lovers and husbands were readily subject to being treated as chattel just a few steps up from their slaves.",1459209600,,414,5.0144927536231885
2822152,2,B000PGTPH8,"Second season of Rome takes more liberty with interpretation of historic events and characters than the first season. I am assuming that there is not a third season since Cesar has died, Antony and Brutus too. And, we can add Cleopatra and Cicero to the death lists. These deaths are all historic, but the character portrayals lacked conviction for me. Trying to update a 44BC character to the same ethos and pathos as someone today always doesn't work. In Season 2, for me, a history buff, it didn't work. Cleopatra and Anthony come off as the least believable for the time setting. Putting so many characters in black leathers to update their profiles was a bad idea. Creating street gangs in Rome allowing viewers to infer this time was the beginning of the Mafia is a big jump too. I continued to watch out of curiosity, but Season two did not work for me.",1459209600,,860,4.590909090909091

Much of what we are today grew out of that civilization.  The series is so well executed it puts you there in the middle of things.  I wish this series could have lasted much longer.

2822275,5,B000PGTPH8,"As a history, the ROME seasons are not entirely accurate. However, as a historical novel, they are surprisingly accurate in the feeling for the way of life.  The accurate demonstration of the ""Pater Familias"" in Octavian, and even Verenius and Pullo, portrays how western societies developed into male dominated, flawed, warlike cultures.  On a lighter level it was sad to see the demise of secondary characters within the frame of the majors'.  I would have wished for further seasons as the Rome we know today was not the Republic but the Emperial which developed after the series ended.",1458000000,,589,4.989795918367347

8191252,3,B000PGTPH8,"Worthwhile to watch for the amazing sets and costumes,BUT it is nearly ruined by the uninspiring script. By the gods couldn't they have hired some decent scriptwriters! Agreed history turns into a charade with historical fiction,but the characterization of some of history's most enigmatic characters just floundered completely with such poor quality writing. Fortunately the acting is excellent and through facial gestures and physical demeanor the viewer does somewhat experience their reality,especially  Vorenius. But kudos for the great love scenes, especially between Julius and Cleopatra. Shame writers made a monster of her in her own court where she is shooting arrows at a terrified old man. Unlikely. Could've mentioned the lighthouse of Alexandria (truth not fiction). This light impossibly could be seen at Rome showing her love for Julius Caesar and hopefully bringing him back to her. To this day they do not know what fuel she could've used for it's light to have reached Rome. The lighthouse still stands in Alexandria. And as a footnote,despite lifetimes of looking they have not found any grave or corpse of Cleopatra.",1526947200,,1137,5.351955307262569

8191255,1,B000PGTPH8,Mistakenly thought this series was produced by the History Channel.  Found out too late it was by HBO.  It is not a historical documentary.  It is just a drama set in the historical time period of  Julius Caesar.  Mostly it follows the lives of 2 roman soldiers.  Very graphic and disturbing sex and violence scenes.  Really over the top and not necessary.,1521849600,,356,4.645161290322581
