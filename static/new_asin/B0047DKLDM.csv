4284973,1,B0047DKLDM,"Unfortunately this DVD tends to freeze throughout the playing, despite having attempted playing on different DVD players! Despite the cleaning and noting no scratches plays thru and occasionally needs to be restarted to enable continuous play. Don't wast your time on this one!",1354665600,,277,5.465116279069767
4284974,5,B0047DKLDM,"Documentales/Homenajes como este mantienen nuestra tradicion salasera viva. Esto es un joya para todo salsero de tradicion. El contenido es fabuloso y la calidad del video es muy buena. Es cierto que no hay bonus features ni ninguna opcion y que el menu es bastante simple pero para mi eso no opaca la importancia de este pieza. Gracias al Banco Popular.

Quienes han tenido que colocar las canciones una por una deben intentar la opcion INICIO que aparece al final de la lista de canciones del primer menu, a la derecha de la opcion MAS.

If known would not have purchased.",1299024000,,115,4.8
4284976,3,B0047DKLDM,"As this was ""a homage"" to El Gran Combo, I expected a more complete history of the group. Former vocalists (Peyin, Rodriguez, Andy Montanez and Roberto Rohena) were absent. MArtin, who was always the happy clown, was not given proper participation either. Pictures, clips, etc of these members (and others not in the group today) would have given us a true history of the group.

In addition, the 1st. time I saw the dvd, I had to click after each song in order to get to the next one. Extremely annoying. The 2nd. time around it went automatically. I expected to have some more information in the ""Behind the Scenes"" segment. I was left with a sense of ""something's missing here"".
My friend, who's equipment is older and doesn't have a remote, was unable to view past track number 3.
Also, the interviews and takes were cut too abruptly and the writings were left on screen too short to read all.
I enjoyed all the songs and interviews, but expected more.",1296604800,,956,4.590643274853801

4284978,3,B0047DKLDM,"The overall production is good, sound quality is very good but the video quality could have been better coming from Popular.

Sobre todo cuando yo empece a tener uso de razon canciones como Vagabundo, Los Zapatos de Manacho y Eliminacion de los Feos marco mi preferencia total por el Gran Combo. Aparte tambien me hubiese gustado un concierto como tal del Gran Combo. Espero tomen en cuenta mi sugerencia y coloquen en Amazon conciertos en vivo de ese super grupo de salsa.
