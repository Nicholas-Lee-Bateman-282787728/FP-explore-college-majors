8157315,5,B000KJTBTW,"This doc was very thorough in explaining why some women choose out of hospital birth, plus this birth center looks amazing! Very inspirational & informative. I was very touched. Didn't notice a quality issue with the DVD - it is a documentary, so some noise/distraction was expected, it actually added to the organic nature of the content.",1263600000,5,339,4.964912280701754
8157316,4,B000KJTBTW,"not very good quality in the recording.  The background noises were sometimes louder than the people talking.  Especially when Ina May was talking.  But, I still enjoyed the DVD and recommend it to others who are interested in midwifery.",1185753600,6,237,5.0256410256410255
