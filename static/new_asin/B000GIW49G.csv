(The base painting is covered in about 15 seconds) From there on out is is pretty redundant. He never tells us what brush he is using and he never even says what medium his is using, though you can assume it's acrylics. We also do not get to see the source picture he is using, although he mentions it a couple of times.

  It is an awesome painting and Derek is a very talented artist. I just wish the video covered more steps in his process.",1177545600,,614,4.142857142857143
