To be honest I had never even heard of this case and so it was an eye opening reality of truth and a twisted concept of control and ones passion to free speech and the art to express oneself.

Ai Weiwei is a voice to the idea of human rights through his social commentary and criticism to a government that he believes and many believe are taking away human rights and trying to control its people by arrest and hush hush tactics and extreme measures to persons they seem fit. He is a bold artist that expresses the reality of political in nature and also an artistry that is controversial in nature and yet beautiful in all its reality.

I think the brilliance of Weiwei stance is he knows who he is, what he believes in and expresses the value of human life and the want and need of being allowed to express and also demonstrate what he and so many feel is wrong.

This is a touching documentary and a documentary that expresses the art form of how the art world can make a statement through political and cultural realities expressed through the art created.

His 71 days of detention was unlawful and despicable in every manner, particularly the mental torture inflicted upon him.  The Danish filmmakers have done the Western world a big favor in documenting the ""real"" China.  China has no freedoms, particularly for dissenters, and the legal system is a non-existent and in clear violation of the Chinese Constitution.  Even lawyers are being thrown in prison for ""subversion of state secrets"".  If you care about the decline of civilization, China is the number one money-obsessed, corrupt offender.  Ai Weiwei deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and this film clearly documents his on-going suffering.",1426032000,3,853,5.281481481481482
