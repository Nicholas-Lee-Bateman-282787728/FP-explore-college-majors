8064052,5,B0000016TK,"Terence Stamp gives an incredible performance and Ustinov delivers a riveting production of Melville's largely unread classic.

Melville is a hard read. He's very detailed and deliberate and his stories do not adapt well to the screen. Still, Ustinov grabs the essential theme of the conflict of Justice and Law and coveys it well. As big a fan as I am of Melville, Ustinov did better justice to the ending, which was overemphasized in the book.",1151107200,3,445,4.855263157894737
8064053,5,B0000016TK,"This film is unforgettable. Superb adaptation , wonderful cast Terence Stamp as Billy Budd and Robert Ryan , and the extarordinary talented Peter Ustinov carries this film to a good port.
You'll feel the unjustice in your own flesh. The depicted situations will keep you at the border of your seat.
One of the winners films in this specially and wonderfilly creative year.
A must in your collection.
We are expecting hopefully the transfer in DVD!",1088380800,13,447,4.894736842105263
8064054,5,B0000016TK,"OK. Here'e the deal: The term ""original"" for the Ustinov version is a misnomer, and the opera is not a ""remake."" Britten's opera, first produced in 1951 (and subsequently produced in a revised version in  1960) is based on Melville's novella, first published postumously in 1924  (I think?). This operatic version is a video of a recent English National  Opera production, and has little, if anything, to do with the movie.  I've  seen both versions (and read the book). Billy Budd is one of my all time  favorite operas and this is a particularly fine production. Philip  Langridge's performance is outstanding, and the staging is thoughtful and  well designed. However, Britten isn't for everyone. Billy Budd can be a bit  of an acquired taste, so know what you're getting into or keep an open mind  before taking the plunge. Certainly the rewards are great. The Ustinov  video is available for rental at various places. Terrence Stamp is  excellent. Billy is a difficult role to present believably (and Thomas  Allen, as the operatic Billy, is wonderful musically, but can't match  Stamp's marvellous, frank naievete). Because my taste in Veres runs more to  Philip Langridge than to Peter Ustinov, I didn't find Ustinov's portrayal  particularly satisfying, but this may be more of a personal preference.  The opera (with a libretto by E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier) is closer to  the original Melville with one large exception. In the opera, the officers  recognize the inevitability of hanging Billy right away and Vere remains  silent in tortured consent, whereas in the book and in the movie, Vere has  to convince the drumhead court of it's unpleasant duty to hang Billy. The  movie fleshes out Melville's narrative with additional action, though it,  too, remains fairly close to Melvilles basic idea. So, there you have the  chronology and parentage of the versions in question. If anything, there  seem to be a few elements Ustinov took from Britten/Forster rather than  from Melville.",960508800,18,1997,5.067692307692307
8064055,4,B0000016TK,"(Is The Ring just another remake?  Or Otello?  Or My Fair Lady?  What do you think this 1962 movie is, that you all seem to find so ""original""?  Surely not Melville!)
The casting in this  production is exceptional and the staging truly ""original.""  My  only qualm is with the singers' diction, especially in the larger scenes.  Unless you can get a copy of the libretto to follow, this might not be the  version for you.
I have yet to find another production, however, so this  is probably your best bet.  Maybe the DVD release will have subtitles  (English for English?  Stranger things have happened).",948585600,4,603,4.6826923076923075
8064056,5,B0000016TK,"I concur with Ms. Brown.  The black and white 1962 drama is a classic, much underappreciated today.  I've been searching for the dramatic version (with Peter Ustinov) since I saw the film on AMC many years back.  Amazon,  find and sell the dramatic version, please.  I have no interest in the  operatic rendition.",946425600,7,313,4.811320754716981
8064057,5,B0000016TK,"Like Cocorose from Florida, I am hoping that Amazon will make available the superb 1962 black and white film directed by Peter Ustinov who adapted  the story of Billy Budd from the broadway play based on Melville's novel.  Ustinov plays the captain of the 18th century navy vessel, and Terrance  Stamp is superb as Billy Budd. It is a very powerful film.",941241600,6,354,4.67741935483871
