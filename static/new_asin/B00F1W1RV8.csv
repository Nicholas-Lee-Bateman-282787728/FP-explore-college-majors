5963553,4,B00F1W1RV8,"I purchased this to play in the background during our Christmas party.  I played it on a projector and played it using a receiver and high quality bookshelf speakers.  The results were great.  The sound coming from this DVD is better than what I could get out of a CD.  Very rich and clear.  Plus it has some comments throughout about the group and those were a great plus of Lady Antebellum fans.

Pros:
Great Sounds
Good Picture
Great for social gathering.

Cons:
None",1388534400,2,470,4.523809523809524
