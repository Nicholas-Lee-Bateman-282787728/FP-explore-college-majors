4830260,5,B005LVEFSG,"I am playing these 4 DVDs with my Onkyo DVD Changer with HDMI cable to 52 inch Samsung TV and an optical audio cable to my Onkyo 7.1 Receiver.  The sound is great.  I am not listening to the TV speakers sound only the receiver.  These performances were from Television broadcasts made in 1989 Mikado 151 minutes, 1990 The Gondoliers 152 minutes, 1995 Patience 130 minutes and 2005 HMS Pinafore and Trial by Jury 130 minutes.  If you look closely at the performer you can see the microphones on their faces. The picture quality is consistent with TV i.e. 480i.  The DVD Changer up converts the DVDs to 1080i.  I think if you have a home theater system (5.1, 6.1 or 7.1) you will enjoy these DVDs.",1354924800,19,695,4.433070866141732
4830261,4,B005LVEFSG,"These videos are fun. They are big, glitzy, elaborate productions with good vocal performances, and beautiful sets and costumes. A down side is that they are very untrue to the original Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. It is not unusual to have a bit of topical updating to the script, and it is fun to have some witticism pop up, directed at a local personality or situation. But in this case, there is so much change to the script that, while the changes are funny, one misses the original humor which was also quite funny and, indeed, what was written. It is disappointing to wait for a favorite line and never have it occur.
  Not only the words are changed, but some of the orchestration has been changed. The enlarged arrangements fill up the Sydney Opera House, but leave one wondering whether this was  Gilbert and Sullivan or Johann Strauss.
  For long standing Savoyards of a flexible temperament, these productions are a stimulating frolic. Purists will be disappointed, and viewers new to the operettas will receive the wrong impression. I am happy to add them to my collection of other performances, but if I had the choice of only one, would go with the Opera World productions.",1341532800,4,1191,4.762135922330097
4830262,1,B005LVEFSG,The box set has such potential with the best of their works included... When we opened the first on - HMS Pinafore we were shocked at the poor quality of the recording. The sound was of such low standard that we had to turn up full ball to hear the words at which point it started distorting. The picture quality looked like it had been through the mill and back - very grainy and like it had been recorded back in the 70s. And every 30 seconds it would pause and then suddenly jump forward - such a disappointment!,1326585600,25,515,4.212121212121212
4830263,3,B005LVEFSG,"These productions are traditional, and at the price OK to have for lovers of G&S.  But the productions are a bit dumbed-down.  G&S should be played straight which emphasizes the wit, not slapstick which dumbs down the humor.  The singing is OK, costumes and sets are OK.  I would prefer to have DVDs of the D'Oyly Carte productions but can not find any.",1323648000,11,353,4.555555555555555
4830264,3,B005LVEFSG,"It looks like these were transferred from VHS which is a pity because the productions themselves look very good. The quality of the sound is mediocre and there appears to be something wrong with the aspect ratio. Overall, probably (just) worth the low price.",1323129600,14,258,4.886363636363637
8478583,5,B005LVEFSG,Best Gilbert and Sullivan value I've found. Opera Australia puts on a wonderful show.,1472774400,,85,5.142857142857143
8478584,3,B005LVEFSG,"The video quality of HMS Pinafore is excellent, the sound is good,  and the aspect ratio 16:9 full screen. All of the others performances are in the old format (I assume 4:3), grainy and will not fill the screen (could not zoom to fill screen) . Had Pinafore been as poorly recorded as the others I would have returned the set. I looked again at the listing, and it says the aspect ratio is 1.78:1 which is the same as 16:9. But ONLY Pinafore is 16:9. The others are not. Amazon should correct this so buyers know they are getting  old technology recordings of the other operettas.  Another reviewer states that the recording of Pinafore is poor.  Perhaps a newer Pinafore has been put in the set I received, but the others are still in the old format.  Had the others had the same recording quality as Pinafore, I would have given the set 5 stars.  Had Pinafore been the same poor technical quality as the others I would have given the set one star.  The performances are very good, and will not disappoint a G and S fan.",1464393600,,1022,4.375661375661376
8478585,5,B005LVEFSG,What can one say about Gilbert & Sullivan? Pure humorous entertainment. These DVDs are the next best thing to a live production.,1448409600,,128,4.863636363636363

will contact you re return/refund .  have not dared  play others.....bit too stagey..  felt production tongue in cheek and slighty superior and jokey to G&S",1390608000,2,319,5.176470588235294
8478591,5,B005LVEFSG,"You can understand the Aussis better than the Brits.  It was well acted, well sung and the sets were very clever.",1387411200,2,113,4.380952380952381
8478592,5,B005LVEFSG,"Gilbert and Sullivan can be enjoyed immensely if it is performed well with highly professional and enthusiastic cast members, great sets and brilliantly performed music.
Or it can be endured as a scholastic performance relying on the audience to perceive the humour in the words.
This production is very much one of the former, with a wonderful sense of fun projected by the entire cast coupled with excellent sets, brilliantly played music and top quality production. I particularly enjoyed the judge in Trial by Jury, performed by Anthony Warlow, whose characterizations are legendary.
My only criticism is that the sound quality is not very good, having been taken from a live stage performance.
This selection of G&S should be shown in schools to spark the interest of young people.
I would suggest that the selection should be enjoyed by all G&S fans and would make a great introduction to those who have not had the pleasure",1382400000,3,930,4.967948717948718
