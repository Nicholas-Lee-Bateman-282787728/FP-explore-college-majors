8667257,2,B00LOCLDWM,"The kids seem to like them, but these are possibly the worst knock off movies I've ever seen. Yes, they are really that bad. I bought these for a road trip, and they are so bad I stopped and bought headphones for my daughters. It was either that or a bridge embankment.",1509753600,,269,4.1923076923076925

8667261,1,B00LOCLDWM,"all these films are produced by the sand company, ""Burbank Animation Studios"". These films are not nearly as enjoyable as the ones found on the first set. The animation is below Filmation standards. The voice acting is whiny. The plots are uninspired, and the characters are unbearable. There's nothing redeemable here. Although every runtime is under an hour, each film drags. I guess I should be happy there's no singing. That is, save for The Little Mermaid, where she sings the same song 3 times. I only paid $5 for this set, which evens out to $0.50 a movie, so I probably shouldn't be complaining. You really do get what you pay for, here, folks.",1425859200,,652,4.678260869565217
