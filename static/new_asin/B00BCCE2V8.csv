5577743,5,B00BCCE2V8,Extraordinary concert.  It was to be expected.  Anything conducted by Gustavo Dudamel is guaranteed to be good.  I have enjoyed it in all its grandeur.,1371168000,3,151,4.96
5577744,5,B00BCCE2V8,"The program of the concert outstanding. The soloist, another young star delivering superb interpretation under Dudamel magic and superb orchestra.",1371168000,2,146,6.35
5577745,5,B00BCCE2V8,for turning on loud and enjoying all over the houses this is GREAT!  I have many classical recordings of these composers--but this is different. Dudamel makes it more fun!,1369612800,2,171,4.896551724137931
5577746,5,B00BCCE2V8,"I don't often feel compelled to write a review after viewing a video presentation.  But after listening to this concert, I was left no choice.  The sound quality was superb throughout.  Gautier Capucon and his cello sounded like they were sitting in my living room.  His performance was mesmerizing.

I have heard Beethoven's Fifth hundreds of times, but never quite like this version.  Gustavo Dudamel's interpretation brought a freshness that gave new life to this old war horse.  I must also praise the fine camera work that added much to my enjoyment.  I will be recommending this DVD to all my classical music friends.",1369526400,37,623,4.923076923076923
5577747,5,B00BCCE2V8,"This is an extraordinarily beautiful concert!
Gustavo Dudamel's conducting stance at Brahms's 'Variations on a theme by Joseph Haydn' and Beethoven's 5th symphony are extraordinary.
And there is this young man-Gautier Capucon. The way he plays Haydn's cello concerto is absolutely charming.
On the whole, this is a real beautiful concert.",1369008000,30,338,5.647058823529412
5577748,5,B00BCCE2V8,"Gustavo Dudamel  is one of the youngest conductors. He is so full of energy, enthusiasm and passion, that it is contagious. He inspires and challenges his young players so very much. I enjoy his talent and personality. Can't wait for his next DVD.",1405123200,,247,4.744186046511628
5577749,5,B00BCCE2V8,"Delighted with the conductor's manner, the orchestra's playing, and the opulent sound and views of the concert venue and individual players. The Haydn seemed a mite easier to record than the Brahms variations, perhaps because of the smaller orchestra. The Beethoven was very well done, and the audience's enthusiasm was richly deserved. My first view of conductor Dudamel was rewarding. We should expect great things from him.",1400284800,2,426,5.373134328358209
5577750,5,B00BCCE2V8,"The stars of the 2013 European Concert were a formerly obscure conductor from A Third World Country named Gustavo Dudamel and a handsome young cellist named Gautier Capucon. If you haven't heard about these young men, where have you been in the past five years?
The concert was held in Vienna's Spanish Riding School, where the Berlin Philharmonic played Brahms' Variations on a Theme by Haydn, Haydn's Cello Concerto No. 1 and Beethoven's 5th Symphony.
Who will be the stars in the 2014 European Concert, which is coming soon.",1387411200,,527,4.932584269662922
5577751,5,B00BCCE2V8,I have viewed this many times. Dudamel does an excellent job of bringing out the music. The setting for this concert is remarkable.,1379203200,,131,4.739130434782608
5577752,5,B00BCCE2V8,"Yes these Live DVD Concerts from Deutsche Grammophon""do really put you in the middle of things!
This was especially true of the Haydn Cello Concerto
I don't think that you would have got a better view,even if you were actually present.
Of course,our friend,Gustavo Dudamel,was really superb,especially in Beethoven,s 5th Symphony
Keep up the Good Work!",1379203200,,352,5.303571428571429
5577753,5,B00BCCE2V8,The selection of the music is excellent and the Beethoven Fifth is superb particularly with the uplifting conducting of Gustavo Dudamel.,1376524800,,136,5.523809523809524
5577754,5,B00BCCE2V8,"Gustavo Dudamel introduced the world to the spectacular  youth orchestral development in Venezuela and is now a familiar figure on the international stage. Some purists are troubled by his effervescence. I'm not a purist and I love his energy and excitement. In classical music it doesn't get much better than the Berlin Philharmonic, and The European Concert pairs  the  dynamic young maestro with some of the world's finest musicians. Their collaboration  brings us Brahms, Haydn and Beethoven climaxed  by Beethoven's 5th Symphony, which might lift you ought of your seat.",1374796800,16,575,5.344444444444444
5577755,4,B00BCCE2V8,"An excellent performance and production of superb music.  We particularly enjoyed the vitality of the conductor, and we are great Beethoven fans",1372723200,9,144,5.545454545454546
5577756,5,B00BCCE2V8,"... more for the ineluctable musicianship of the Berliner Philharmoniker, the virtuosity of cellist Gautier Capuon, and of course the three composers than for Gustavo Dudamel. Don't jump to the conclusion that I'm dissing Dudamel! I live in California! I wouldn't dare! And besides, I think Dudamel is the hottest thing since chilis habaneros. But his conducting here, especially of the Beethoven Fifth, is atypically modest and restrained, The Fifth is played with near perfection as a monument that needs no conductorial supervision. The Brahms ""Variations on a Theme by Joseph Haydn"" elicits more daring from Dudamel. No more flamboyance! Gustavo is proper and careful in demeanor throughout, as if the discipline of his orchestral forces constrains his Venezuelan ebullience. But one thing he proves in this performance: he can listen as well as lead, and that's a damned fine skill for a conductor to have. Watch the faces and postures of Dudamel and his cello soloist Capuon during the Haydn Concerto No. 1! Capuon plays entirely by memory, often with his eyes closed for extended passages, while Dudamel watches him with raptorly attention, transmitting the cellist's intention to the alertly obedient orchestra. All in all, that's how an 18th C Concerto should be led, with minimal egotism on the baton.

The sound recording is excellent. The performing space - Vienna's Spanish Riding School - gets just the right amount of camera time. What's not to like?",1371772800,11,1465,5.181434599156118
5577757,4,B00BCCE2V8,"First off, I have to admit the Berlin Philharmonic is probably one of the two or three orchestras I enjoy watching.  Their playing is full of life and it's exciting to watch the player's physicality - it makes for great entertainment to a one-time orchestral player to see players actually move to the music.  Gustavo Dudamel has a long-standing relationship with The Berlin Philharmonic and it was obvious both he and the orchestra are very comfortable with each other.  The Brahms was just right - economical but lush in all the right places.  This Haydn cello concerto performance is one of the most likable I've witnessed - not really ""Romantic"" but definitely not classically delicate.  Capucon's playing is precise and his cadenzas virtuosic - a terrific performance.  And the Beethoven was just right - having heard Dudamel's Beethoven  with the LA Philharmonic, I felt like I was listening to an old friend - he does a terrific fifth, and this was no exception. This program was perhaps a little less ""flashy"" than some of the other European Concert discs in my collection, but it was well worth watching - and I'll probably be re-watching this one with some regularity.  A very well-played concert of three old favorites in a beautiful setting.",1371513600,26,1253,4.9052132701421804
8565899,5,B00BCCE2V8,I love this performance. I watch Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 once or twice a week with a Manhattan.,1497312000,,98,4.5
8565900,5,B00BCCE2V8,Magnificent sound and very well done video in a difficult space - the arena used by the Lippezaner stallions of all places.  The mics were well placed and the cameras achieved excellence with severe limitations.  The Brahms as breathtakingly beautiful.  Caucon is such a master of the cello.  Dudamel just brings a level of electricity to the hall that is unmatched.,1464566400,3,366,4.950819672131147
8565901,5,B00BCCE2V8,Shipping was exceptional!  Thank You.  Gift for my father in law......haven't heard back whether he's listened to it or now but I am most certain that he will enjoy it.,1451433600,,168,4.566666666666666
8565902,4,B00BCCE2V8,I never got the chance to finish it!!! Everything I put it on I fell asleep. That how soporific it is! Mr. Dudes & Gautier Capuon put on a great concert.,1438819200,2,153,3.967741935483871
8565903,3,B00BCCE2V8,"The orchestra and conductor are astounding.  But the editing of each performance was more than annoying. It was chopped and edited like a modern television drama. The camera shot is 2-5 second shots pieced together. No chance to enjoy technique or the intensity of the performers. Quick glimpses of the guest performers went the same. Therefore, while the music choice and performers was top notch I can't say anything good about how the dvd was arranged. On the side, I really enjoyed the informal teaching section.",1432425600,4,516,5.0
8565904,5,B00BCCE2V8,orchestra and conductor top notch--conductor is magnificent--wonderful hands--very expressive hands and no excessive arm or hands flapping around!.  Dudamel is my favorite conductor.,1425427200,,182,6.913043478260869
8565905,5,B00BCCE2V8,Great,1420243200,,5,5.0
8565906,5,B00BCCE2V8,Excellent. This is exactly what my wife wanted. And I enjoyed it also.,1416960000,,70,4.461538461538462
8565907,5,B00BCCE2V8,"The Spanish Riding School in Vienna provided a surprisingly good venue for this program. The conducting by Dudamel is  impressive, and the Berlin Philharmonic is at their usual suburb best. The rendition of the Beethoven 5th symphony is easily the best of the five recordings, all by well known conductors and orchestras, that I possess. The Hayden cello concerto featuring Gautier Capucon is also very good and the Brahms Variations on a Theme by Hayden is certainly fully adequate. The video and audio quality is beyond reproach. I highly recommend this DVD.",1416441600,6,560,5.086956521739131
8565908,5,B00BCCE2V8,"What a treat!...
The marvelous Berliner Philarmoniker, Gustavissimo, and the Capucon brothers...Heavenly,heavenly,heavenly!...
The future of classical music is bright with musicians of this caliber!
THANK YOU...!",1412899200,,212,7.1923076923076925
