8678258,4,B00NHG1DC8,"Clearly Mr Serling's involvement was peripheral, and only for profit, but this is an entertaining entry into the 1970's slew of ""ancient mysteries"" films...Good footage and image and sound quality. Heavy emphasis on South America. Im not saying this is hard science in any way, shape, or form. It's just that this is the type of program that used to fire up my imagination as kid back in the 70's. I much prefer something old like this to the slew of video-shot nonsense they are making today...",1488153600,,495,4.7011494252873565

8678262,4,B00NHG1DC8,"Rod Sterling never disappoints. In my opinion, his name is equal to Kubrick. If you've never seen this documentary, you're in for a treat. It truly is extraordinary. Here's why:

Yes...a few of the mystical topics covered in this documentary are debated, rehashed, and sensationalized to this very day. However, much of the discerning and unsettling subject matter you may never, ever have been exposed to. Just remember it's Rod Serling we're talking about, and his approach with the perplexing and inexplicable oddities that make up the subject matter here is not a mere conspiracy theorist take. Rather, it's a scientific and intellectual perspective through the eye's of an absolutely fascinating writer, film producer, and director who invariably appreciated the bizarre and the strange. He had an uncanny way of putting words together that when heard, would put a twitch down the back of your spine. Serling's (albeit) way with this production keeps your eyes glued and you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat. His observation brings forth an interpretation of these fascinating mysteries that are baffling, uncommon and exceptionally intriguing in only a way Rod Serling could present.

I remember seeing this back in the 70's, sometime after it's initial release. I vividly remember how ""weirded out"" I was after seeing it. It definitely opened my mind to the possibilities that, things may not always be as they seem. After watching this Film Chest release, that same feeling returned. Only now, I could watch it in a new light with a few decades of experience behind me. Yet, it still fascinated and drew forth some different thoughts to those same enigmas.

The Film Chest version is presented in it's original aspect ratio of 4x3. It could have been chopped to fill a 16x9 hdtv, but at what cost? It would have been stretched, or the top / bottom cropped and a pan & scan application incorporated. Thankfully, that didn't happen. This DVD is pretty good but not great. Some of the interview footage may have been shot with a Super-8 film camera for all I know. The color isn't as vibrant as one would hope. However, the DVD appears to noticeably improve as the feature goes on. I do know that this is a rather rare document so finding a primo source film to master off-of may not even exist. However, If you're a fan of Serling, the bizarre, the unexplained, or the weird, I know you will really enjoy this DVD, as I did. There's footage that you'll see nowhere else. And it's a heck of a lot of fun to put in the disc with some friends and kill some time. But be forewarned if you watch this in the company of others: This makes you think, fosters opinions, and after a couple Rum & Coke's, be prepared to watch the sparks fly.",1416441600,7,2743,4.7343096234309625
