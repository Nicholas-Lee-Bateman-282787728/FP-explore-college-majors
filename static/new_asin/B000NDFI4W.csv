8176964,3,B000NDFI4W,"It's curious to see Le Jaguar if you have already seen Francis Weber's very funny Le Chvre, because they share so much in situations and filming, and Jean Reno and Patrick Bruel make a good pair, but Le Jaguar doesn't quite come off.  The helicopter views of the Amazon, however, are incredible.",1372896000,,295,4.673076923076923
8176965,1,B000NDFI4W,"This review is for the DVD rather than the movie.  This DVD has one of the most egregious insertions of a commercial for another film that I have ever encountered.  When you insert the disk into the player, a preview begins.  One cannot skip past it, fast forward through it, or call up the menu.  One must sit through this commercial each and every time the disk is played.  I am resigned to the fact that I must skip past commercials on most disks, but to be forced to watch a commercial on a disk that I paid for simply isn't acceptable.",1215648000,10,540,4.254901960784314
8176966,5,B000NDFI4W,"Enjoyable movie with some very impressive location work and some of the best aerial photography I've ever seen - Veber has an impressive visual sense of scale, and the film never looks less than gorgeous.",1214956800,,204,4.857142857142857
8176967,5,B000NDFI4W,"I've seen this so many times when I was younger, and I still love it. It's hilarious, there are fight scenes and a tad of romance, and a great overall theme: save the forest and its habitants!",1212624000,,192,4.216216216216216
8176968,3,B000NDFI4W,"Le Jaguar is Francis Veber's throwback to 50s-60s on-location comedy adventures, meaning there's not much comedy and not much adventure but the casting and production values carry you along regardless. Patrick Bruel needs to get out of Paris when his gambling debts are sold to East European gangsters, so agrees to go with Jean Reno's environmental activist to the Amazon to find a local chief's soul (long story) only to discover his real self in between being possessed by the spirit of the chief.

In truth there's not much going on here, but it's still an enjoyable movie with some very impressive location work and some of the best aerial photography I've ever seen - Veber has an impressive visual sense of scale, and the film never looks less than gorgeous. Vladimir Cosma's score is also superb and Patricia Velasquez makes an appealing leading lady. The film didn't live up to expectations for a Veber film (possibly because it was released locally against Mission: Impossible) and despite its good intentions can be seen as patronising towards the natives, but it's still an enjoyable diversion.",1201305600,8,1106,5.010869565217392
8176969,4,B000NDFI4W,"Fans of Jean Reno have to catch this one. Even if you aren't a fan of foreign films you will probably enjoy it. While on a mission in the city to spread the word of his people an Amazon Shaman enlists some men to help his tribe back in the jungle. Reno is great as the anthropologist helping a gambler the shaman believes is a prophet. I recommend you watch it in French with subtitles. The subtitles are slightly messed up in a few places (Amazon tribe subtitles, which aren't in English, overlap English subtitles) but the English dubbing is terrible and you can tell it isn't Reno. I'm not sure why as he speaks English. If you enjoyed ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" be sure to catch this little jewel. Good action and comedy. I highly recommend it.",1184716800,11,746,4.374100719424461
