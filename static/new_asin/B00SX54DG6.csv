8699661,2,B00SX54DG6,"Since this DVD is advertised as a collectors edition I was expecting it to include all the episodes from season 6 or at least include something special that the complete season 6 DVD didn't include. but instead it only includes 6 episodes from season 6! 2 episodes on disc 1 and 4 episodes on disc 2 and thats it! No special features or anything else that you would expect to see in a collectors edition DVD! I wish the fact that it only included six episodes was listed in the product description, which it currently isnt. Seems like a waste of time, money and materials to me! Bottom line don't buy this unless you're trying to collect all the FOP DVDs like me, otherwise just buy the complete season 6 DVD. Im only giving it 2 stars because i love FOP and I collect FOP DVDs, otherwise itd be 1 star since its useless when you can buy the complete season 6 DVD for less.",1515110400,,873,4.296969696969697
