The plot involves newbie Frankie Stein's first week at Monster High (she was just recently created by Dr. Frankenstein rather than being born), which thanks to her reliance on teen magazines for advice, is a complete disaster.  Fortunately, after finally learning her lesson, Frankie is able to repair the damage her lies had wrought.  Gently Pushed Moral: Be Honest and Be Yourself.

6508743,4,B00LWJ3OB0,"As far as i know this is the first one played on tv and it had me hooked im now obsessed with all the monster high movies. :)

FROM THE BACK OF THE DVD
The first week of school can be a total torture chamber, but Frankie Stein is about to discover how to survive her first day of Monster High with sinister style! But when she gets on the wring side if reigning fearleading queen Cleo de Nile, Frankie will discover that being her freaky fabulous self might just be the best way to plug in with her new drop dead monstrous classmates!

Its only about 30 mins long and doesnt have any bonus material.
Usually amazon has the better prices on movies but this one was a walmart exclusive and i got it from my local walmart for $5. Now i just hope theyll release scaris city of frights on dvd and of course keep making new and even more awsome monster high dvds.",1406160000,13,857,4.156626506024097
