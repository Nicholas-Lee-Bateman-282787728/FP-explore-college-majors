4713168,5,B005JTE37S,"This is an important video, well done and straight forward. As leg amputees face challenges, both physical and mental, Yoga can become a beneficial tool in the health and well-being of those facing such challenges. The video shows that Yoga, and it benefits can be performed and enjoyed regardless of leg amputation. The soldier in the video is a bilateral, above the knee amputee, performing many of the classic yoga positions. For those amputees wishing to pursue Yoga this video shows you how. The instruction is clear and easy to follow. I really like the fact that all proceeds from the sale of the video going to the Wounded Warrior Project.",1321142400,10,647,4.837837837837838
4713169,5,B005JTE37S,"I have been an above the knee amputee (my left leg) for five years and this video is exactly what I've been looking for. If you're thinking of purchasing, it's great that Amazon has a 7-day rental to try it out. I will definitely be purchasing this video.

Equipment needed:
A raised platform (and a partner) for the headstand - don't worry, that sounds way scarier than it really is
A yoga ""brick"" for one pose

The young gentleman in the video is an above the knee amputee on both legs and does the entire routine without the use of his prosthetic limbs. Because I didn't know what I was getting into, I did the routine with my prosthesis on. You would definitely get an effective yoga workout either way, though if you are an above the knee amputee you know that when you extend your limb unsupported, it bends at the knee on its own.

The gentleman in the video goes through the poses while a woman - presumably his yoga instructor - gives instruction. It is very much like being in a yoga class with another student, the whole thing very casual and somewhat unlike a normal yoga DVD in that there is no beach with crashing waves, etc. Just a simple and effective workout.

The asanas (or yoga poses) are all seated or lying down with the exception of the headstand which is only a very brief part of this video. You would be able to perform any of these positions without the use of a yoga mat and, again, the brick is only for one pose. You could even roll up a towel to get the same effect.

As for the workout I received? Challenging in a good way and I have a feeling the product will grow with me as I loosen up and become more advanced. The video is approximately 20 minutes long, but each pose is only done once (or in the case of working one side or another, twice in order to work the extra side). It would be easy to hit pause and go through each pose again to give yourself more of a workout.

Wonderful video with proceeds that go to an excellent cause!",1319414400,9,1970,4.254010695187166
4713170,5,B005JTE37S,"I have been an LBK amputee since 1999, and love, LOVE this dvd! I am new to yoga and have been searching for ways to adapt it to my needs, so I was thrilled when this dvd popped up on my search for amputee yoga. I would recommend it to any lower limb amputee; the poses are definitely challenging while being something I can achieve. I would give it 10 stars if I could! And on top of all of this, the proceeds are going to the Wounded Warriors project. You can't get any better than that!",1315958400,14,489,4.051546391752577

8476000,1,B005JTE37S,"I bought this DVD for my partner who is a recent amputee (losing one leg at the knee).  Having practiced yoga both in a studio setting with a teacher, and in the privacy of our own home using other Yoga DVD's, I was hoping that this DVD would provide the same quiet, calming, mindfulness and even-tempo-ed approach to various yoga poses with the necessary/appropriate modifications for people with amputations.  The student in the video is a double amputee (both legs), and he demonstrates the poses very capably.  Sadly, the camera work for this DVD is poor/amateurish. The camera angles often fail to show the viewer more than just a part of his body (as opposed to the actual form of the body as a whole while in a pose).  The ""teacher"" runs her student through his poses as though she is a drill sergeant and he is performing a military calisthenics regime ... it's WAY, WAY too fast!  An able bodied person would have difficulty keeping up!!  But isn't the whole idea of yoga to be fluid in movements that are made slowly and mindfully to attain a pose that is held and enjoyed for more than a second??  The setting for this DVD  is extremely ""sterile"" (a makeshift ""gym"") and in the background, are the young man's prosthetic limbs (oh, and an adorable dog wanders through as well, but I doubt his role was scripted).  Where's the peaceful vista to evoke quiet and calm??  Where's the soft, soothing music in the background??  The music is very annoying and repetitive (as in the same four chords strummed on a guitar with a bad drum back-up). The teacher's voice is also very loud and, sadly, somewhat annoying in timbre.  Both my partner and I agreed that we would prefer to watch the video with the volume ""off"".  But worst of all is the pace of the program.  Yoga is all about the gentle stretch, the calm, mindfulness and the peace attained when poses are reached and held while focusing on the breath.  There ISN'T TIME TO DO ANY OF THIS as the teacher moves almost frenetically from one pose to the next.  Given this was just about the only yoga DVD made with the amputee in mind, it was a HUGE disappointment.  Both my partner and I agree we would much prefer using one of our regular yoga DVD's and simply make our own attempts to modify the poses when necessary.  My advice ... save your money (make a separate donation to the Wounded Warrior Project) and stick with a really good Yoga DVD and simply modify the poses to meet your needs.",1419897600,9,2453,4.51131221719457
8476001,5,B005JTE37S,I am a new member of the amputee club. Still waking up at night forgetting my leg is gone and attempting to walk to the bathroom and falling flat on my face. : )  It is so hard to find exercise equipment / workout videos so I was excited to find this one.,1418688000,,255,3.811320754716981
8476002,3,B005JTE37S,This is strictly for people with both legs amputated. I was hoping it would have some variation for people with only one leg but it does not... Needs a little more explanation of product.:),1415404800,5,189,4.588235294117647
8476003,5,B005JTE37S,"Awesome work out. I'm a left above the knee amputee. I do regular Yoga workouts but have to transition into some positions with my prostetic off. Just a suggestion, I would make it longer and harder. Especially for our guys in the military who are used to working out. Also arm amputees might be a good one to work on. Glad someone is doing this. Thanks",1414713600,,353,4.363636363636363
8476004,5,B005JTE37S,"My physical therapist has said that my hip flexors muscles were too tight and were causing the lower back problems I was getting in my prosthetics. She recommended I start doing yoga, so I ordered this DVD. Since then, I've been able to get my residual limbs to lay flat on the ground when I'm laying on my back and the pain from my lower back has ceased when walking. Yoga has been a great way to improve my quality of life as a DAK amputee.",1393200000,3,442,4.151162790697675
8476005,2,B005JTE37S,"I have worked out with many videos, brands and type of training for a number of years.  I became an AKA last October and received my first prosthetic in March of this year.  I found this video undemanding and way too preschool for me.",1351468800,,234,4.295454545454546
8476006,5,B005JTE37S,"I really liked the video.  It would be nice if more could be made.  I always search for exercise videos that are all floor because I am a RAKA and it is not comfortable to me to exercise with my prosthesis on.  I swim but I needed something to tone.  This will help a lot.  There are hardly any exercise videos out there that are all floor, and you won't know until you buy them.  I would also like pilates for amputees.  I think you guys have something here but you should take if further :) thanks for making this! Rachel",1341360000,10,523,4.118811881188119
