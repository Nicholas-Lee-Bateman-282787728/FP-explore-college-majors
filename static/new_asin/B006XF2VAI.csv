5036583,5,B006XF2VAI,Our country is headed off a cliff. Anyone who thinks otherwise is being patently dishonest. This is a must-see and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Long live Atlas Shrugged...,1344470400,10,167,5.0
5036584,1,B006XF2VAI,"I have always been fascinated by the cult following that Ayn Rand and her books somehow acquired. She supposedly invented pure reason, which hasn't changed much since her death 30 years ago. This is despite the fact the topics actually based on reason, such as science, economics, history etc etc constantly change with advent of new facts. But Randians are very good at ignoring facts while claiming to be ""objective."" How Objectivist not see how they're cultist is really a feat of the human mind to deceive itself. The doc, much like her books, his hugely lacking of any academic substance other than rosy eyed telling of ayn rand's biography. In fact, there's a good amount of wrong information and outright misinformation in this documentary, such as the repeated line about overregulation causing the economic collapse of 2008. In fact, DEregulation has been the major political trend of the past 30 years. To say otherwise is being patently dishonest. The film has the tone of other religiously motivated docs and writings ive seen, casually scaring you with today's reality while simultaneously comforting the poor viewer that there are answers, and we're lucky you only have to google a single name to get them.",1344297600,27,1220,5.014778325123153
5036585,4,B006XF2VAI,"I watched this documentary to decide whether to read Atlas Schrugged (because it's so long).

As a film I found some of the music rather distracting, yet overall I felt that it was dry and not engaging. Perhaps it suffered from a bias toward Ayn Rand's philosophy, or maybe I am too skeptical of her ideas and thus of this documentary. I found the selections of testimonials to be a little too one-sided for my taste, but perhaps it is unavoidable as the goal of this film seems to be to validate Rand's philosophy rather than to arrive at a conclusion upon exploring the idea. Overall, I found this documentary pretty informative, which I believe warrants my 4 stars rather than 3. It has convinced me to attempt at Atlas Shrugged as a part of a quest to arrive at my own understanding of how society and government should work.",1337644800,4,829,4.526666666666666
5036586,5,B006XF2VAI,"Thoroughly appreciated the story behind the novel/perspective that greatly influenced my position on our economy and regulating authorities.  For those that have not read Atlas Shrugged, this well done piece will light the much needed fire under your arse.",1337644800,3,256,5.564102564102564
5036587,5,B006XF2VAI,The movie comes off as a combination of biography and documentary of the life and work of Ayn Rand.  It is wonderfully done and I remained interested throughout.  Her Prophecy and Philosophy are more clear today than ever before and not surprisingly her books continue to increase in sales as time goes on.  Liberal or conservative you need to view objectively...see if the things she wrote about in 1957 are coming to fruition today.,1337385600,2,434,4.837837837837838
5036588,5,B006XF2VAI,"If you have heard about ""Atlas Shrugged"" and Ayn Rand but haven't had the time or the patience to read the book, then this documentary is for you. It's a brief and concise account of Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism as presented in her novels ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged."" It also gives a brief account of Ayn Rand's life, the writing of ""Atlas Shrugged,"" its critical reception (universally panned) and its commercial success. It has not been out of print since it was originally published, and since the financial crisis and recession has sold several hundred thousand copies every year for the simmple reason that much of what she predicted has come true. Unless we pull back from the brink, it is very likely that the full dystopian world of ""Atlas Shrugged"" will arrive by mid-century.",1334016000,63,805,4.883211678832117
5036589,5,B006XF2VAI,This takes the book and looks at what is going on today and draws parallels.  Very interesting thing to watch after you read the book!,1333670400,5,134,4.36
5036590,5,B006XF2VAI,"the dvd that you get is standard flare. The extra interviews on the dvds are fairly short but there is no play all function to them. That is the only backdraw to the dvd for those who like this feature such as myself.
The documentary is a great primer for those interested in ayn rand and the history of her two most famous books- the fountainhead and of course- atlas shrugged. The documentary follows ayn rands path from childhood to her becoming an author and how the ideas of both the fountainhead and atlas shrugged were formed. Once the documentary gets to the publication of atlas shrugged it deals with how critics viciously panned the book yet now its reguarded by many who read it one of the best novels of the 20th century- of course don't try to argue that point with any college proffesors. The other aspect to the documentary begins to make comparisons of todays financial chaos and employnent problems to atlas shrugged which was 1st published back in the 50s. It makes for great conversation and some heated discussion to be sure when one of the aspects to raynd's belief was that religion was something one could do without. (A fact I myself have a hard time believing)- however the comparisons to the book and todays world are pretty hard to ignore and that is what makes this documentary so fascinating to watch.",1333411200,15,1331,4.620253164556962
5036591,5,B006XF2VAI,"This independently produced documentary is the story of Atlas Shrugged, including what led Rand to write it, how it was received by critics (loathed), by readers (loved), how it's remained a bestseller year after year for over half a century now and how - horrors! - the novel's scenario is being played out today in real life.  Rand said: 'Identify a society's  core philosophy and you can predict its future.'  The film early on raises the question: how did she know fifty some years ago what America was going to be like today?  And then goes on to examine the change in American thinking that took place over the course of the 20th century that led us to where we are now.  Those unfamiliar with Rand and her philosophy of Objectivism might be surprised or not agree with her ideas but there's plenty to think about here.  And you don't have to have read the book - or any Rand book - to get a lot out of it.  Highly recommended for Atlas fans and those looking to familiarize themselves with Rand's ideas and their relationship to today's headlines.",1328745600,197,1054,4.544973544973545
5036592,5,B006XF2VAI,"The documentary, at times, felt like an infomercial for the book (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but that's the only negative. It's a bit of a refresher course on Atlas, it provides great insight into Rand's goal, adds to ones understanding of the book and helps dovetail her prophecy with the world we live in today. If you took the time to read the book (which clearly was a major commitment) another 90 minutes won't be that difficult.
The documentary also walks you through Ayn Rand's life and helps the viewer understand why she wrote the book.
The movie reminded me that I need to go out and find new people who might learn from the book. As I left the theater, I actually considered reading it a third time...thankfully, I quickly came to my senses (LOL!)",1328486400,86,769,4.579710144927536

5036599,4,B006XF2VAI,"I'm surprised it took me until I was 42 years old to read this...arguably one of the most famous books written in the twentieth century.

It took me 2 months to read it, and as I got closer to the end...I found myself wanting to stretch out the ending and make it last longer.  How could this be you ask, when the paperback version is thicker than an old fashioned telephone book?

Well, I have to say - this book has changed my thinking.  Yes, you heard me right...this book has actually altered the way I think about certain things, [success, guilt and moochers to name just a few]. I realized Ayn has a point...well, several amazing points that I wish I would have been wise enough to discover on my own.

I'm so grateful to Ayn for having the guts to stick to her beliefs and write about them.  In the era this book was written, that was anything but easy to do.

And this isn't some dry, philosophical novel.  Ayn Rand has created her ""own little world"" in which her ideals of life can be put on full display.  It is truly masterful writing, full of romance and suspense.

I was raised with the thinking that Ayn describes in her book...and after finishing this book, I now look at the word ""sacrifice"" and how I apply it to my my daily life - and my thinking is much different than it used to be.

Ayn steps ""out there"" and shoots the reader straight, and although I cannot agree with ALL of her philosophies, I can embrace the differences in my thinking [and more importantly, the difference in how I'm feeling] and I have immense gratitude to the author for sharing her beliefs with the world.

Rarely do I read  book that leaves a lasting impression on my life, and it's always such a joy when I truly discover something about myself in the pages.

This is one of those books I will give to my kids for Christmas...and then find ways to help them read it and apply it to their lives.",1471910400,3,1892,4.307909604519774

5036605,5,B006XF2VAI,"This was better than I thought possible.  It gives insight into her thoughts as writing the book.

5036606,3,B006XF2VAI,"""Ayn Rand and the Prophecy of Atlas Shrugged"" gives a basic overview of Rand's literary carreer and some basic information about her philosophy and moral values and what shaped them. It tends to feel a bit too much like a promotional film at times and get a bit too heavy on contemporary politics, but that's to be expected. Those already familiar with Rand may not learn much from this film but for others it may be a good introduction.",1454025600,,437,4.544303797468355

5036619,5,B006XF2VAI,"This movie is more of a documentary of how Ayn Rand developed her theory of objectivism and how she applied it based on the changes she saw in American culture when writing The ""Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"".  It also explained her definition of ""selfishness"" and why she thought it was better than the concept of altruism which was, and still is, generally promoted by, and accepted by, our culture.  It explained how those two books were her attempt to inform the American public her vision of the future based on the way things were changing.  Alas, the message did not get received by those who could make a difference, especially the media critics.  For those of us who are paying attention, it is all too clear that her predictions were almost completely accurate.
While I understood the concepts and prophecy shown in ""Atlas Shrugged"" immediately while reading it, I did not understand Ayn Rand's background that helped her form her philosophy.  This documentary helped me further understand what she was trying to say and more importantly WHY she was trying to communicate it.  This movie is well worth the time to view it, especially if you are not willing to take the large amount of time required read ""Atlas Shrugged"".",1433808000,4,1235,4.857142857142857

5036628,5,B006XF2VAI,"I read Atlas Shrugged as a Sophmore in high school and really did not understand the significance of what Ayn Rand was trying to say...........""Prophecy"" tells you everything you need to know AND be aware of.  Being born in 1941, into a lower middle-class family was obviously a disadvantage, politically, because ""growing up in the 50's was idealic and we never looked backward.  Sadly, even though I was aware of what was happening to our country early-on [2006] I was not only ""too late smart"" but also not one of the ""young, movers & shakers"" that it would have taken to change the direction that ""the powers that be"" [government] were taking us as a country.  I would like to be able to say that I have hopes that the legacy of FDR taken to ""almost fulfillment"", by The Obamanation, will still not succeed but I'm afraid that I am seeing the glass half-empty rather than half-full. Hopefully, that is just age-related thinking.  Even though I have managed, by hard-work, perseverance, and education to raise myself to upper-middle-class, I see the retreat all too clearly now.

The movie, Atlas Shrugged, was a impossiblity from the beginning.  You cannot transfer the ideas of a ""novel with an important message"" and over 1,000 pages long, into a movie even covering 3 DVD's without trivalizing the message.",1425081600,6,1313,4.839285714285714

5036636,4,B006XF2VAI,"I read the entire book of Atlas Shrugged.  I've read much of the comments and reviews of this and find them classically predictable.  If you are liberal, you hate it!  Today we have 50% of the population living in some form off the government boob producing nothing, paying no income tax and the other 50% paying out their nose in taxes to try to support them.  The liberals call that ""altruism"".  I call it manufactured dependence.  Our deficit is now well over 18 trillion dollars but the liberals have such tunnel vision that that number doesn't even register.  It just doesn't register.  Instead of having programs to help people help themselves, the liberal wants the welfare faucet left wide open and unattended.  They don't even know that if you took every single dollar, literally every single dollar from the producing rich, you could only pay for 8 days of government spending.  Her prophecy has already come true.  We are printing money like crazy telling the masses we are fine.  You can't make a liberal accept reality when their minds are closed like a steel trap.

5036637,5,B006XF2VAI,"No one these days can read Atlas Shrugged and look at any news report and not be horrified.

I'm in my late 30's and returned to college a few years ago. We covered Ayn Rand's philosophy in one of my classes. Myself and one other student were the only ones who said, ""Ya, maybe she has something there."" Almost instantly we were shunned and looked at as monsters. I really wish I was lying about this, but it's true. We were met with comments about how selfish we both were, how we had no morals and what horrible people we were and how we will die alone. Never mind that I've been married for 19 years and counting. Never mind that I volunteer at a shelter. No, clearly I'm a monster because I want to live my life and give back as I want, not as I am currently being forced to with my tax dollars.

At this rate, I fear for the America that my nieces and nephews will inherit. I truly do. We live in Rand's fictional world right now. There's no ""Maybe in the future it might happen."" It's here and now. Never before have our rights as Americans been infringed upon like it is now. You can't speak your mind or you are branded with some negative stamp. We have people in the news now who it's been proven they are paid to Not brand companies as being ""racist."" If you give them large sums of cash you're not ""racist"" but if you don't here come the smear campaigns! Horrifyingly, people think that's apparently ok! The worst part is, it's not just happening in America.

I started primarily with her non-fiction philosophical books; yet this resurgence of her works is well founded and I'm thrilled to see all of her works getting the recognition deserved.  Especially the ""Atlas Shrugged I & II"" movies... leaving me in breathless anticipation of ""Atlas Shrugged III""  to be released late 2014; which is the most awesome chapter and captivating conclusion to the phenomenal novel!!! I highly recommend all of Ayn Rand's works with the utmost enthusiasm and respect!

It's easy to see how the manipulative mind will gravitate to such idealism, even if that ideology is fictional. It's like saying the Bible should be taken literally, then changing it to embolden and emphasize your own manifesto and point of view. Oh wait, that's what the Christians do! Watch this movie and you'll probably read the book. I reads the book when I was in High School in the 1970's, when such reading was encouraged as part of education rather than mind control.

The welfare state has driven the nation's debt to over $17T with no end to the increase of the debt in sight.

5036698,5,B006XF2VAI,"Rather that consider this as a 1000+ page book, consider it as a trilogy of three 340 page books. This is the way they are presented even though they are in a single volume. Conservatives and libertarians will love it while liberals will detest it. Why? The book reads like it is coming from today's news stories.
Two quotes and a paragraph from the book (ISBN 978-0-451-19114-4):

  ""Society is suffering fro lack of business opportunities at the moment, so we've got the right to seize such opportunities as exist. Right is whatever's good for society. 'He didn't dig that ore single-handed, did he?' cried Phillip . . .."" (page 131)

  After a catastrophic railroad disaster that killed many, including a politician: ""He had received word of the catastrophe at eight o'clock this morning . . .. The men who had been his marked cards -- in a game he knew how to play -- were gone. Clifton Locey was barricaded behind the statement of a doctor who had announced that Mr. Locey was suffering from a heart condition which made it impossible to disturb him at present."" (page 573)

  ""The reporters who came to the press conference in the office of the John Galt Line were young men who had been trained to think that their joy consisted of concealing from the world the nature of its events. It was their daily duty to serve as audience for some public figure who made utterances about the public good, in phrases carefully chosen to convey no meaning. It was their daily job to sling words together in any combination they pleased, so long as the words did not fall into a sequence saying something specific."" (page 219)

  ""There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted -- and you create a nation of law breakers -- and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the game Mr. Rearden, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with."" (page 404)

And finally:

  ""I saw the tax-collecting vermin that had grown for centuries like mildew on d'Anconia Copper, draining us by no right that anyone could name -- I saw the government regulations passed to cripple me, because I was successful, and to help my competitors, because they were loafing failures -- I saw the labor unions who won every claim against me, by reason of my ability to make their livelihood possible -- I saw that any man's desire for money he could not earn was regarded as a righteous wish, but if he earned it, it was damned as greed -- I saw the politicians who winked at me, telling me not to worry, because I could just work a little harder and out smart them all. I looked past the profits of the moment, and I saw that the harder I worked, the more I tightened the noose around my throat. I saw that my energy was being poured down the sewer, that the parasites who fed on me were being fed upon in their turn, that they were caught in their own trap -- and that there was no reason for it, no answer known to anyone, . . .. And then I saw that the whole industrial establishment of the world, with all of its transatlantic cables, its mahogany offices, it stock exchanges, its blazing electric signs, its power, its wealth -- all of it was run, not by bankers and boards of directors, but by any unshaved humanitarian in any basement beer joint, by any face pudgy with malice, who preached that virtue must be penalized for being virtue, that the purpose of ability is to serve incompetence. That man has no right to exist except for the sake of others . . .I knew it."" (page 702)

Consequently, as the story progresses the conservatives and libertarians will be saying, ""We told you so."" while the liberals will deny that we are heading in the same direction as the story leads us. While we do not have a John Galt yet, we are seeing those that are taking similar approaches as those that John Galt selected.
The only failure of the plot that I see is that even after the collapse, the producers will build it back up but the same looters will exist and the cycle will just start over. History tells us that we will continue to make the same mistakes over and over again. In fact, the US is only the most recent on the same path to decline through the path of socialism. All we can hope to do is to learn the lessons from a novel that we refuse to learn from history and delay the inevitable until we pass this onto the next generation and let them read the book and save themselves.",1357344000,6,4799,4.435227272727273

5036710,5,B006XF2VAI,"In observing the new rise of collectivism and socialism in the United States, you definitely get the feeling that Ayn Rand was absolutely correct in her books.  The takers start outnumbering the makers and things go downhill from there.  Business is demonized.  Capitalism is called evil.  People are treated as groups, not as individuals.  This is certainly the direction of the country now.

But Ayn Rand was not right about everything (her ideas on religion were biased) and there is a good chance her ""prophecies"" will not become completely accurate.  If they do, the United States will certainly become a Third World country dominated by other countries who adopted our former economic system.  My view is that we will learn our lessons from collectivism and too big and too intrusive government to eventually turn things around.  At least that is my hope.

Ayn Rand's ideas are always worth listening to.  You will broaden your mind.",1353196800,5,939,4.993548387096774
5036711,4,B006XF2VAI,"I was sick for a few days and decided to watch this documentary because I'm just very curious about how conservatives think the way they do (and why so many recommend reading Atlas Shrugged).  Also, I don't have the time or ambition to read a 1200 page book!!  The documentary itself is a high quality one and I thought the filmmakers did a good job.  It explains Rand's life, interviews many conservatives (and some moderates), and summarizes the general plot of Atlas Shrugged (along with a few passages/quotes from the book).  However, the one thing that really pisses me off is that while I'm not trying to say that Atlas Shrugged is a bad book or that Ayn Rand isn't a great philosopher/writer, how can so many conservatives interviewed in the documentary claim that the US will ""fall apart"", just based on a black and white interpretation of a piece of fiction?? To read this book and then try to apply its lessons to your life, like it's some kind of a bible, is just plain ridiculous! Lots of people think that On the Road by Jack Kerouac is a great novel, but that doesn't mean that one should search for meaning in life by doing drugs, having sex, and seeking adventure (well, I'm sure many people do, but that is a very hollow life indeed!)! If conservatives would just stop behaving like we are living in some kind of fantasy (i.e., that our world could somehow become like the one in Atlas Shrugged), maybe things would actually get accomplished in DC.

5036713,5,B006XF2VAI,"Outstanding documentary that discusses Ayn Rand's journey to America, how her life before her emigration helped shape her philosophy and how she arrived at 'Atlas Shrugged's chilling, accurate account of present-day America's dismal state of affairs.  Check out the documentary, then go read Atlas Shrugged, Fountainhead and Anthem!

On a more general note, it's confounding that people can spew hatred toward an ideal that simply encourages all people to be creative and productive.  All of Ayn Rand's works are a MUST read for American individuals if we want to develop innovative and creative pathways to a productive future for generations to come.",1352332800,6,652,5.372549019607843
5036714,5,B006XF2VAI,"I purchased the Ayn Rand video because I loved Atlas Shrugged.  The video really explains what is happening right now in America with the Democratic Party's attempt to change America to socialism/communism, which is simply turning the USA into a dictatorship with only a few people controlling all the money and giving it to their cronie pals. I am old enough to remember the USSR and their rise and fall. Don't let it happen to us.

5036715,3,B006XF2VAI,"It swiftly becomes obvious that those making this documentary are persons who think, somehow, that a novel depicting a scenario that has never happened and never will is in any way relevant to anything except its author's fantasies.  Particularly disturbing is how the nightmare vision of Rand's novel is latched onto with the same fervor the Rapture is by enthusiasts of the *Left Behind* series.

The head of the Rand institute kvetches about taxes, leading me to conclude the Randians do not even understand capitalism, which is all about exchange of goods and services.  His position is that he should not be forced to pay one dime to benefit from the American society that has made his success possible.  He doesn't seem to understand that it is not that he is being preyed upon by looters who wish to steal from him but that he is being helped by those who wish to give him that beneficial society.  All I could think was, ""What a pathetic person.""  Here we have not only a giant failed attempt to rationalize not caring about one's fellow human beings but a short-sighted failure to appreciate the benefits to ONESELF from a society that functions--or, worse, appreciation without a desire to pay for it.  Where do you think it all comes from?  You aren't entitled to, nor is it possible to have, a functioning society for free.  Who is the moocher here?

The historical information given about Rand is valuable, as are the clips of her speaking, because she is a fascinating character, but her admirers seem not to appreciate that her entire oeuvre was an overreaction to the Soviet state, a state that bore and bears little resemblance to the American one.  Hate the Soviet system all you want, but don't pretend that Western Socialism is in any way like it.  That just makes you look silly.

5036717,1,B006XF2VAI,"I was hoping for a thoughtful philosophical analysis of Rand but this 'documentary' with arguments on both sides but it really failed. Now before you jump on me and call me a stupid liberal (I'm a moderate btw), first tell me which of the interviewees in the documentary was providing any kind of counterpoints to either Rand's philosophies, or to the claims about the accuracy of her 'prophecy'.

The documentary states over and over how amazingly accurately her prophecies have come true. But how can you honestly make a claim like her prophecies of government takeover have unfolded to the word without addressing a fact like US taxes have been going down since she wrote the book?? I'm not saying she's right or wrong, but if you can't actually bring up and address pretty obvious criticisms but just assert that she's right then this is just a propaganda piece. I'm sorry. Even your run of the mill discovery channel documentary on prophets like Nostradamus will have interviewees going back and forth about how certain prophesies came true or how the prophesy was so vague that you could use any event to make it true. There was none of that in this movie. The position was that her prophesies came true 100% no argument.

The format was designed like a propaganda piece, too. It starts out with a decent background on her life and if it just stuck to that I'd have given more stars. There were claims interspersed but I figured later on there would be a section that finally analyzed things, but it just got graudally more and more pro-Rand until the last 1/3 of the movie which was almost like a political ad jumping between all the interviewees gushing at how amazing and accurate her work was with cherry picked examples. You can look at any government at any time in any country and find examples of government overreach and conclude we are on the verge of her distopian future. It's such an easy claim to make, it's no prophecy.

Again, I'm not saying the viewpoint of the movie is wrong. A documentary can either be balanced, which this one is not, or present a solid argument. It presents an argument but one full of holes, which is as good as no argument. Give me a critical analysis of points and counterpoints and maybe I'll believe you. Don't parade only pro-Rand advocates like bank ceo's, the president of the Ayn Rand foundation, and wall street manager (yes, ""Wall street manager"" was literally what they put for her name every time she talked, guess if she was pro or anti-rand) who just repeat each others' points.

If you want 90 minutes of Rand cheerleading then watch. This felt like a waste of 90 minutes.",1347235200,31,2633,4.655913978494624

5036720,5,B006XF2VAI,"This independently-produced documentary does a great job explaining who Ayn Rand was, and why her famous novel Atlas Shrugged has been getting so much attention lately. Within the span of 90 minutes, you get a good, clear overview of Ayn Rand's background and philosophy, why she wrote the novel, why it was hated by critics when it was published in 1957, and how accurate it's been in predicting the miserable state of American politics today. There are many clips from interviews from a variety of different people, and I think the selection was fairly balanced. One minor problem is that the documentary does give away some of the plot of the novel. So if you haven't read Atlas Shrugged (and you intend to), I recommend reading the book first, then seeing this documentary. One final note: I personally would have preferred more discussion of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, and her ideas on the nature of reality, knowledge, morality, human nature, and art. But I suppose that's a job for a future miniseries, not a 90-minute movie.",1346716800,6,1043,4.898305084745763

5036722,5,B006XF2VAI,"Ayn Rand predicted the kind of world that would result if her philosophy (Objectivism) was not accepted and adopted by the western world, especially the USA.  Her prophetic prose have come to pass, according to this video.  Rand predicted a world where crony capitalism would rule the USA while politicians lied to the people about what they were doing... or going to do.  She prophesied a world where people who produced anything were subject to rapacious government obligations and taxes while the economy languished in a swallow of high taxes and government restrictions.  All this has come to pass, according to Ayn Rand and the Prophecy of Atlas Shrugged.  Ayn Rand's prophecy is now upon us and we are reaping what we have sown.  She warned, in the 1960's, what would happen if the USA and the west did not depart from its course of government intrusion upon the productive people... upon the thinkers and producers... upon the free mind.  This documentary contends that all this is now a fact and we are suffering mightily because of it.

Atlas Shrugged is Ayn Rand's magnum opus; the summation of her philosophy of objectivism.  This documentary, to be really good, has to sum up that philosophy well.  Does it do that?  I think the summary of objectivism is well done, but somewhat lacking in the in depth and quality needed to fully explain her philosophy and its outcomes.  Ayn Rand was an unrestricted capitalist.  Government had to get totally out of the economic system so it can sprint along propelled by the energy of free minds.  But she was also an atheist who rejected any idea of God (god) as mystic.  She thought that production was the key reason and purpose of humanity.  The documentary does not go into Rand's ideas that throughly.  We find out she is a capitalist that demanded a minimum of government in people's lives, but we do not discover the depths of her atheism and the resulting ""production"" as purpose in human life.

Nonetheless, it does explain that Rand did predict the conflict in the west that we face today.  Reason vs. Mysticism, in Rand's term (see Philosophy, Who Needs It?).  While the documentary fails to mention Kant and his philosophy, in Rand's writings Kant is the major villain who pushed the west into its present predicament.  It is the rejection of Kantian philosophy that is necessary for us to move forward.  Because we have not rejected that philosophy, and its inherent call on mysticism and irrationally, we have failed to release the full potential of the human mind and thus stifled the one true source of human energy and advancement - the human mind.  Rand thought to release the mind one must have freedom, both political and economic.  Any restrictions on these freedoms was a restriction on the human mind and thus restricted the basic source of human resourcefulness and power.  Because we have chosen to continue and expand the restrictions on these freedoms we will suffer complete obliteration, economic and mental, at the hands of the irrationalist.

Whatever one may think, the west is having some fundamental problems and may not climb out of its self produced epistemological hole.  Was she right?  This documentary raises and, at least, points to an easily understood conflict in western philosophy.  You must be the judge; however, in the opinion of this film Rand was correct and we can now see that her warning went unheeded.  We face total annihilation of the western way of thinking because of the rejection of her philosophy and the continued acceptance of Kant.
