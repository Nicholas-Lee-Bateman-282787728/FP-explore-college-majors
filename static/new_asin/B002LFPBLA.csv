3947333,5,B002LFPBLA,"I had never heard of this movie before I started watching it on Parables TV. I had just watched several Christian films and most of them left me wishing for a bit more, a ""je ne sais quoi"" that would leave me more satisfied. I didn't have high hopes that The River Within was going to satiate that unknown itch. It was produced by Cloud Ten Pictures but nobody's names I saw anywhere in cast or crew was familiar to me. So I set sail from the starting point since I had nothing better to do. When I disembarked about 100 minutes later, I knew what that nameless longing within me. The movie was about letting the river of life flow from us, the river of living water. God is not interested in big name casts or huge budgets or exquisite movie sets. To tell you the truth, the most sophisticated computer graphics don't impress Him in the least. His goal for Christian media is to point the way to Him for all unbelievers and those believers who risk being spewed out of His mouth. This movie hit the sweet spot, especially when the pastor of the church learns what it really means to be a shepherd as opposed to an administrator, preacher, or businessman. And one actor, Josh Odor(Lauri) impressed me enough that I have put his name on my list of potential thespians to recruit for my own films, should my dreams ever materialize.",1357776000,,1330,4.4105691056910565
3947334,5,B002LFPBLA,"My husband and I really enjoyed this film.  As many in our generation, we have mixed feelings about our own breed--Christians.  We usually approach anything with a marked Christian message with a little bit of caution, because sometimes the ""religious feel"" almost washes out the true charisma and Spirit of Jesus and what He came to do in and through humanity.  It seems that pretty much anything we humans touch becomes a bit marred, but the message of love despite our imperfection and brokenness shines through in this movie.  In The River Within, the good ol' religion actually comes to contact with some realistic issues of family pain and human suffering--causing anyone who has a heart to look inside and see his or her own speck.  Thanks, Zack and everyone involved!",1312588800,4,775,4.885496183206107
3947335,5,B002LFPBLA,"i love this movie, it show the purpose of the christians in this world, and how we could help our youth to follow jesus way.",1311897600,,124,4.0
3947336,2,B002LFPBLA,"Professional cinematography is lacking in this movie along with a not well tied together story line. A lot of video shots were right in the face of the people speaking and some shots looked liked the camera was sitting on a table while the people spoke. The title is misleading too; other than the main character occasionally visiting the river which impacted his father, I could not figure out any other meaning to the river within. I would describe this movie as a 2nd rate, family movie and really cannot recommend it.",1284768000,,521,4.673913043478261
3947337,5,B002LFPBLA,"This film was made by a bunch of young people just out of college. I think it's really well made. The content is REALLY deep and deals with a lot of major issues that more people need to pay attention to. It left a couple issues open that I thought should have been better explained, but overall it was a great story and very interesting. I would highly recommend it.",1274832000,6,367,4.257142857142857
3947338,3,B002LFPBLA,"After watching the trailer I had some high hopes this would really minister to our young people.  I admit I hadn't watched the film before showing it to our young people, but after watching the trailer I didn't think that would be necessary, my bad.  I had introduced the film as one that would speak to the adjustments that are some times necessary when walking with God, from our plans to His.  At the end I was able to talk to our young people, but the way the movie was made there was an aspect that overshadowed that thought in the film that had to be addressed.  The aspect was a problem that we often see and one that needs to be addressed in the church, but it was not one that the trailer gives you any hint about.  I would say that the film could be a positive ministry tool, but I would recommned any leader watching it first so that you would be properly prepared to address the different issues the film touches on.  Don't make the same mistake I did and just watch the trailer and think you've got it.  Ya live and learn.",1268265600,9,1035,4.223350253807107
3947339,5,B002LFPBLA,"This movie was well done, not exactly as i expected but actually better. i would recommend it if you are looking for films regarding finding God's path for your life but the main message seems to be that we need live what God has placed inside of us.",1268006400,10,250,4.229166666666667
3947340,5,B002LFPBLA,This movie is very touching and all members of a church should watch it. One of the messages of the film is don't forget that members of churches have needs and are not perfect. Don't fill up the pews just to get numbers and not take care of the flock that is there. Great movie,1267401600,12,278,4.072727272727272

3947422,5,B002LFPBLA,"Not at all what I had expected, much, much better. Sometimes we as a church spend all our time trying to help those outside of the church and kind of neglect our brothers and sisters in Christ. This movie focused on that. Even Christians struggle with the plan that God has for them. Great movie.",1473465600,,296,4.4

3947427,5,B002LFPBLA,"This Christian film is great! It takes place in a small town and deals with real church issues (such as confessing gross sin). It draws conclusions consistent with Scripture. Josh Odor plays the somewhat unwilling youth pastor, and he shows real concern for the teens under his care. My favorite scene is when Josh takes a troubled teen swimming, however the teen's confession of his problem in the youth service is a close second. The lack of church support for the teen results in his overdose and Josh's resulting rescue of him. The main pastor has a change of heart on support for believers, which results in Josh's decision to stay on as youth pastor. This movie is on the list of my favorite 50 movies of all time!",1416960000,,720,4.589147286821706

't all movies be like that. Made for the whole family",1361923200,2,124,4.9523809523809526
3947430,2,B002LFPBLA,"Movie drug a little and the message was not exactly scriptural (unless you believe that water baptist actually saves anyone's soul).  The movie just ended without any real ending (like they ran out of film).  Characters were introduced and never developed.  Some characters did not seem to have any purpose to moving the story along.

It was ok to see once as a family film, but I would probably not ever see it again.  It would be better to rent this movie than to buy it as I did.",1360281600,2,482,4.370786516853933
