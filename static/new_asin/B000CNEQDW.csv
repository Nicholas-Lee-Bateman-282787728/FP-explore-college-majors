8099730,4,B000CNEQDW,the concert was really good despite of their aging looks..sad to say that their performance was a bit different during their haydays.the higher tone and pitch is unreachable..above all air supply.. is air supply no matter what.the sound quality is good and the video is not bad at all.,1340841600,,285,4.836734693877551
8099731,5,B000CNEQDW,"I put the DVD in my U.S. blu-ray player and it did not play.  So I looked at the back cover and it indicated it was the PAL version (which plays in Europe, but not the U.S.).  So no big deal, I just popped the DVD into my multi-region DVD player and it worked.  One of the audio choices also did not seem to work, but the other two were fine.  DVD quality is about the same as the newer DVDs on 1080 high def TV; do expect it to be grainy on the background and the dark scenes.

I enjoyed the concert and you can play it straight through or watch it with the interviews.  I actually like watching it with the interviews because it gave interesting personal insights from the duo.  If you are an ""Airhead,"" a fervent fan, then by all means add this to your musical collection.

In 1975, Graham Russell, an Englishman, met Russell Hitchcock, an Australian in Australia.  In 2005, they performed and recorded this DVD concert in Canada.  So they have been working together for over 30 years now.  I think they sounded good and were entertaining, but do not expect them to sound the same as they did when they were younger.  With this in mind, I give them five stars.  Someone wrote that Russell Hitchcock, the main lead, doesn't seem to be able to reach the high notes anymore (true), but I think his voice seems to have mellowed.  There's also a nice version of ""Lost in Love"".",1313884800,,1375,4.299610894941634
8099732,5,B000CNEQDW,"I was hesitant to purchase this due to other reviews, but I am very satisfied.  Love the videos and the interviews by Russell and Graham regarding the songs.  I am an ""airhead"" so I love anything AirSupply.  Well worth the price.  Thanks",1307059200,3,237,4.571428571428571
