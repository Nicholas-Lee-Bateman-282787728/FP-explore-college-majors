2871156,5,B000ROA018,"The Miami Dolphin teams featured in these DVDs are historic since they were firsts to win championship by perfect season 17-0, and their second championship provided feat of first to appear in Superbowl 3 years in a row. Winning 2 out of 3 Superbowls was a great accomplishment. Like all of America's Game DVDs, it showcases whole season not just Superbowl highlights. And the player narratives are great, since they all felt part of something special, like part of history, and these DVDs showcase those historic seasons. Also includes funny stories, inside stories that I assume only players knew and they're telling them to veiwers.",1293148800,,635,5.057142857142857
2871157,5,B000ROA018,"As a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan, I have to say this is the definition of a ""must-have"" product. First, the materials. Boxed in a simple cardboard box, the pair of DVDs have slim DVD cases that sport a beautiful cover (an up-close shot of the respective Superbowl ring) and a DVD. You can either keep them in the box (open-ended on one side to take the DVD cases out), which is pretty durable, or keep them apart. Inside the cases you'll find quotes about how great the series is, and obviously the DVD itself, which is silk-screened with another gorgeous shot of the ring, title, etc. The back of the case is like any movie's: a little summary, shots of the three interviewees, credits and logos.

That itself makes it a worthwhile purchase. Of course, the content... is amazing. The 1973 DVD is pretty much a run of the mill America's Game chapter, which is to say pretty good: interwoven storylines, simple - yet engaging - interviews with those closest to the story (Mercury Morris, Dick Anderson and my personal favorite, Bob Kuechenberg), clips of the games, etc. But it's the '72 edition that really takes the cake. In particular, the intro - I find it a chilling compilation that sets the pace for the entire thing. You have Manny Fernandez: a strong personality and a very much down to earth guy, the mammoth that shut down rushes every year. You have Larry Csonka: the pounder, the very heart of the offense. And you have the Don: Shula, a guy that can be 100 and yet emanates the fire of a young man - which few ever have, as well. The story is one of destiny, and it feels like it, but NFL Films doesn't shy away of telling the stories of close wins and by-the-teeth escapes, like against Pittsburgh in the playoffs.

I could write a lot more... but the best way to get it, is to get it. I would definitely recommend this purchase, no questions asked.",1286150400,2,1863,4.492625368731564
2871158,5,B000ROA018,"If you think for one second you think your a Miami Dolphins fan then you have to make this a buy. Im only 23 years old so this was awesome for me, not being able to have seen the Perfect Season. If you have seen it then heres your chance to relive the moment history was made. This also includes the 1973 season and even some info on the 71' season. This just added to the love I have for Miami Dolphins and I know it will do the same for you.",1273190400,,443,3.8260869565217392
2871159,4,B000ROA018,"A must have for any Dolphins fan. Great coverage of the '72 and '73 Championship seasons. Lots of cool extras like off the field footage with players, interviews and more.

2871162,5,B000ROA018,"As a kid, I followed the Miami Dolphins whether it was the play-by-play radio broadcasts of the late and great Rick Weaver or on my black and white television set at home. In recent years, I had been trying to get a good  comprehensive history of the 'Perfect Season' in particular, but found it quite difficult to acquire. I then stumbled upon this 2 DVD set and I can tell you that this set is worth every penny of what I paid for it and more. The color and sound quality are fantastic and I know that you will be pleased as well. There is archival footage galore and plenty of great football action here, plus interviews from back then and more recent ones. The players interviewed in this set are  Larry Csonka, Manny Fernandez, Mercury Morris, Dick Anderson, Bob Keuchenberg and of course the ""Shu"" himself Don Shula. Put this one on your ""to-do"" list today, I promise you'll not be disappointed.",1207440000,4,901,4.521472392638037
2871163,5,B000ROA018,"Great recaps of the 1972 and 1973 championship seasons; one hour on each season plus lots of bonus features.  A good mix of game footage and recent interviews, briefly reviewing most games.  Players give personal recollections on training camp, Shula, play calls, Griese's injury (enter Morrall) and competing for playing time (Kiick and Morris).  More detailed profiles are given on Larry Csonka, Don Shula, Manny Fernandez, Mercury Morris, Dick Anderson and Bob Kuchenberg.  Off the field stuff includes Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Fernandez catching alligators, Shula's sense of humor (?), and Morris' personal demons (successfully dealt with).  1972 also gets into the No-Name Defense, while 1973 highlights the offensive line.  Bonus features include: Earl Morrall profile, Csonka's personal foul against Buffalo, ""Shula's Way"", knocking off the undefeated 1985 Bears, Superbowl VI (loss motivates the 1972 season), Perfect Legacy, End of an Era, Kuchenberg profile, Mercury and Sinatra, Mercury's rap song on the perfect season.  Some duplication, but overall well worthwhile, with excellent audio and visual quality.",1200700800,12,1131,5.696428571428571
