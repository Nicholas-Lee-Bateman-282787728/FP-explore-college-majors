8373994,5,B002MQXEO4,"Hosts Matt and Peter Wood de-mystify some classics tricks and show how easy it is to ""Do Some Magic."" I wish I had known a few ""Party Magic"" tricks when I was in college. It would have made breaking the ice in a new crowd a lot easier.

There are eleven tricks performed and explained on the DVD. Some tricks require special (inexpensive) props, but most are ones you can do with everyday objects - plastic cups, regular cards, envelops, etc. It's a great introduction for newbies and hobby magicians.
