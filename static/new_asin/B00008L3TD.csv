1850236,5,B00008L3TD,Although it starts out very sad.....as we all long for  this relationship...it turns into a great story.  Loved every part of it.  I watch it over and over again.,1313971200,4,162,4.517241379310345

1850240,5,B00008L3TD,"I have always loved this movie with three great actress's. Any one who is older and can relate to losing a husband then trying to start over..will like this movie. It has funny moments and tearful ones, but overall is a great movie.",1225584000,2,232,4.4186046511627906
1850241,3,B00008L3TD,It really is changed too much from the original play.  Changing characters names is just too much of a change.,1179792000,,110,4.5
1850242,5,B00008L3TD,"The Cemetery Club has been one of my favorite movies for years.  Before purchasing the movie through Amazon, I had been searching all video stores for the movie.  I wished I had thought of Amazon before searching for the movie elsewhere because it was so easy to find on Amazon and just as easy to puchase, as well.

The Cemetery Club is a movie for all ages.  It is especially fun to watch with family members.  The cast is fantastic;  Danny Aiello, Olympia Dukakis, Ellyn Bursten and Diane Ladd and Christina Ricci has a small part in the film as a young girl.

I highly recommend this movie.",1170028800,5,594,4.444444444444445

1850261,3,B00008L3TD,"Our local community theater is producing this play.  The movie is pretty good, but don't bother with it if you also want to produce it in a theater.  It's only vaguely like the actual script!",1406678400,,191,4.428571428571429

I was delighted to find it on Amazon.",1397347200,3,228,3.872340425531915
1850267,5,B00008L3TD,"I am giving this movie 5 stars because it is well acted and has a story line that most people over 55 could relate to.  I would say it is more a woman's film but Danny Aiello who plays the part of a retired cop who lost his wife is a good representative for the male viewer to also enjoy the this film.  I have watched this movie countless times over the past few years.  I recommend this movie to anyone who I feel would like to spend a few hours with people who are learning to cope with the unexpected change to their life.  There are tears, laughs but through it all friendships that help them move forward and look forward to the new journey.  You may also appreciate some of the background music that is in a few scenes.  Is this movie somewhat old fashioned yes but in a rather contemporary way and that for me makes it a movie I would and do recommend to my neighbors who are over 55.",1389484800,2,892,4.097701149425287
