8312786,5,B001JEH2NO,"Riveting documentary done in superb style. It details much more history than just the assassination of Alabama's Attorney General and the subsequent take-down of the Phenix City mob. There are outstanding interviews with many people, ex-Governor John Patterson in particular. This well-researched piece includes interesting details of the Alabama Air National Guard's role in the Bay of Pigs, and the initial friendship and later rift  between Patterson and President Kennedy.  I couldn't stop watching it for a minute.",1453248000,,519,5.641025641025641
8312787,5,B001JEH2NO,"This is a very informative documentary of our history. I have lived in phenix city for past 40 years and this DVD helps fill in some places in the town's history. This is a great companion for ""The Phenix City Story"", which is also a great movie. This DVD shows places and actual videos of some of the original thugs that ran the Phenix City mafia. I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of old time crimes and politics of the south and Phenix City Ala.",1301184000,,465,4.295454545454546
