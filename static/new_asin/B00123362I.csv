Jos Molina ""The fearless"" (Jorge Negrete), Rosario Gmez (Gloria Marn) and Rodrigo Rangel (Pepe Ortz) are three very famous bullfighters (she is the most loved) and in this movie they don't fight just bulls, but their feelings for each other!
Rosario, who never doubted her love for Jos, marries him, and Rodrigo, in a gentleman's act, respectfully, makes himself invisible, while still keeping an eye on both of his friends.
But everything goes wrong with this new couple when she gets pregnant and her husband suffers an accident. Add to that jealousy and misunderstanding and the result is major drama.
Jos always wanted to have a son so he could follow his steps becoming a great matador, but the newborn is a girl and disillusioned, leaves them both.
Rodrigo steps in for support, people start talking, and their fans claim that all three of them appear together in the arena at least one more time. Rosario rejects the idea, but finally agrees and the date is nearer every day, while everyone fears the outcome. Excellent drama!",1316649600,,1061,4.867403314917127
