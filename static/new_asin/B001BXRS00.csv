8285143,4,B001BXRS00,"THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE was one of radio's first spinoff series. Throckmorton P. (for Philharmonic) Gildersleeve had previously been a regular on the FIBBER MCGEE AND MOLLY show, but moved from McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where he took care of his late sister's home and children (Marjorie and Leroy). The family cook's name was Birdie. Over the years there were also recurring characters played by Richard Crenna, Una Merkel, Arthur Q. Bryan, Bea Benederet, Gale Gordon and others. ""Gildersleeve"" ran for eight seasons on the NBC radio network.

Season #1 of THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE radio show is contained on a single DVD. This is not a CD or mp3, but a privately manufactured standard format DVD that contains audio only. (Of historical interest: Only a handful of hours after a devastating morning attack on Pearl Harbor, ""Gildy"" still aired its regularly scheduled episode.)
