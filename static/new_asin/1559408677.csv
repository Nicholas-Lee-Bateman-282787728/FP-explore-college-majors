181497,1,1559408677,"One of the worst movies I've seen. I had high expectations: it was directed by John Woo and stars Chow Yun-Fat. Others had given it high ratings, but I cannot imagine why. Lots of bullets flying in this movie, but do no damage. Early on, one character is shot a couple times in the legs, but soon after, he's up and running around just fine. Others must be shot multiple times before they die, which makes no sense. It is a bad movie all the way around. Later another character is beaten badly and then he is shot and falls into a river, and less than one minute later he appears with Chow to warn him - he is badly wounded, almost dying - but completely dry - even though he just fell into a river. For no reason at all, the evil villain decides he must kill innocent people at a hospital. The only redeeming quality I can think of is that during a scene at the same hospital, cops try to evacuate the building by pressing the fire alarm, and thankfully, it does not drone on and on in the background, it simply goes quiet (for no reason). This movie is not just a waste of money, it's an absolute waste of time. I have not written any movie reviews before, but was compelled to in this case because it was so bad, I felt obligated to warn other potential buyers.",1495238400,,1264,4.205761316872428

181503,4,1559408677,"Yes, I do mean, YES, the stuntwork and the gunplay in HARD BOILED is freakin' awesome but the final result became (to me, obviously) ok enough already this shoulda' been over 15 minutes ago.  I was laughing at the preposterously ridiculous conclusion because I realized the John Woo direction would not stoop to killing one ""character"" while displaying this is just a movie, don't take this too seriously (not a bad thing) when our hero cop (Chow Yun-Fat) has officially turned into a gun-wielding, people saving, comic book super hero.
Dare I say I like my action movies and shootouts with at least a hint more plausibility (like, even, Die Hard had/has) with a barrage of bullets a little less ""selective"" in NOT finding their mark because our hero can't get killed.
Anyways, did I mention the freakin' stunts and shootouts were freakin' awesome?!
What a body count!  What mayhem!  Whew!  I didn't even let the endless display of hurtling bodies on sometimes obvious wires spinning and twisting through the air after another explosion deter my entertainment.  It was just too cool not too appreciate.
I gotta' mention after seeing Chow Yun-Fat again (saw The Replacement Killers first) that it is easy to see why this guy became an international star.  Also, the second-lead action star was portrayed very well and very cool by the slighter of frame but very convincing as smooth, tough guy Tony Leung.
HARD BOILED  had an effective plot twist or two and Director John Woo has a great eye for film making on display with the opening sequence of neon lit Hong Kong shone like classic noir as credits roll and our cop hero to be (with his cop partner on drums) playing some nice jazz saxophone.  Love that sh**.  Hong Kong looks awesome.  The Tea House (with those birds 'visiting') is a place you'd love to visit that you'd hate to see shot-up ...  And you can guess how that goes...

HARD BOILED boils down (sorry) to being an entertaining ride, but sometimes less is more.  One less outrageous shootout of explosions would have rated HARD BOILED better than 4 stars.
As it is the xtras are worth a peek with a couple actors (not Yun-Fat or Leung, though), Producer and Director giving interviews (if you can understand John Woo he's kind of amusing).  I liked the location filming guide segment that pointed out the Avian Flu closed the Tea House not long after completion of HARD BOILED.  No more birds permitted in Tea Houses anywhere.
Oh, and I probably never would have realized (without xtras) John Woo plays the bartender in HARD BOILED.
Another Chow Yun-Fat movie is in the foreseeable future as is a second look at Woo's Face-Off (with Travolta and Cage).",1486339200,,2666,4.752711496746204

181551,1,1559408677,"I know it's an 90's movie, but.....
The acting was really not good.  The subtitles did not match what was actually being said.  I'm Chinese, so I know.  At the first shoot out, did anyone noticed that Chow Yun Fat's character never ran out of bullets, and from two semi automatics, that he picked up off the floor from the gun dealers.  That whole sing along with the secret codes, also was a stupid scene and the singing by all three actors, sucked.  Let's put it this way, none of them could carry a tune.  Think of scratching your nails across the chalk board.  That's how irritable it was.  Stuffing cotton balls into the Babies ears?  Really, that made a difference?  John Woo's bit part of playing the Jazz Club Owner and confidant, was bad too.  I know he's the director, but he should've just performed that role.  And the name used in the English Subtitles, was Mr. Woo.  Could they not afford a character name for him?  Or did he not respond when they tried calling him another name?
Again, I know it's an 90's movie, but think of all the really well made films, like Jaws, ET, Casablanca, A Bridge Too Far, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, Pretty Woman, Year of the Dragon.......all range from the 40's through 90's.
Harboiled had the look and feel of the 80's, but it was released in 1992.  Which is a shocker, considering quality of the film, and the period, which actually made it look like the 80's.  Anyway, I feel like I've paid too much for a movie that really was not John Woo's best, perhaps, maybe, just maybe, it was his best back then.  But it's pale in comparison to even Hard Target, which was made in 1993, with Jean Claude van Damme.
I guess if you were a teenager growing up in the 90's and watching this movie, maybe it was ""wow"", but I can't see where there were any ""Wow"" moments, except when the movie was over.",1435881600,,1840,4.396449704142012

181606,4,1559408677,"""Hard Boiled"" is a razor-sharp action film directed by Hong Kong Auteur John Woo. It stars the great Chow Yun Fat as a police officer caught up in a very complicated case, trying to break up a dangerous triad gang. He crosses paths with psychopathic killers, double agents, and a beautiful brunette along the way.

The action scenes are gloriously well-shot, the violence is played out like poetry before our eyes. By the end of the film, I started to tire of the explosions and blood, but I tip my hat to Mr. Woo. He's shot a very stylish film.

Another interesting aspect of the movie, is that it doesn't sacrifice character development for the action, like so many shoot em ups do. The film establishes a good rapport between Chow Yun Fat, and the other police characters.",1394841600,,775,4.608695652173913

181619,2,1559408677,"One of John Woo's absolute best action films. What a shame that the DVD for this is so pitiful. It literally looks like it was duped from a VHS rental tape! On my HD 60"" TV the picture only fills about 3/4 of the center of the screen. Lame! The source copy is full of specks, dirt and washed out portions. Granted, this DVD is from 1998, but come on! It comes from Criterion, who are far above this public domain level of crappiness. There are a few extras that are nice, but my main reason for buying this was the movie itself, and it left me really wanting and quite disappointed. I coughed up good money for this because I really missed the movie and thought it would be a no-brainer to buy a DVD from The Criterion Collection. Whoops! Shame on me. Should have done some more research. Also, the year of this DVD's original release should have clued me to investigate further. *SIGH*

Someone needs to get off their ass and do justice to this Hong Kong action classic and issue a proper re-master of this film in high-def on Bluray. HARD BOILED deserves far, far better treatment than this. If you simply must have the movie, it's a marginally recommended buy. However, if you insist on top quality product for your collection then steer clear of this particular version. 5 stars for the film itself, but subtract 3 for the abysmal treatment it gets with this Criterion(!) release.",1388016000,3,1384,4.492063492063492

I must say the stunt men in China get away with more dangerous stunts , as for the motorcycle shoot-out , You see a guy's cycle blow up with Him still on it ! John Woo also brought the two-gun gunfight to America . The end shoot -out in the hospital is awesome , even when the Bad guys gun man who got thru most of the movie with only losing a eye at the hospital shows honor an is gunned down by His own Boss  . If anyone who plays PS3 try' Stranglehold "", this game is featured after this movie with Chow Yun Fat playing the character in this movie. The only thing I can say about this regular DVD is it's sub-titled , not English Dubbed  . I also see that Amazon uses all reviews into all of HARD BOILED DVD formats .

181623,4,1559408677,"I just finished watching the Honk Kong film Hard Boiled for the second time. As an action movie lover, I must admit that this film contains everything I adore about the genre and more.

It's a very westernized film, and essentially boils down into a 'loose-cannon cop' movie with a variety of cliches that make American action movies so damn fun.

One of the very first scenes contains one of my favorite cliches in which the chief chews out our hero for prematurely ending a case that the force has been working on for months. This cliche can also be found in the films 'Running Scared' and 'Point Break', among others. I find such cliches funny, so they don't bother me much.

The action in the film is superb. Explosions everywhere, blood flying all around, innumerable faceless bad guys to kill... what else could one want from an action movie? I tell ya, these guys from Hong Kong sure knew how to deliver the goods.

The plot is pretty interesting as well. I won't spoil it for anyone, but be sure to expect some
exciting twists and turns along the way.

181656,4,1559408677,"Hard-Boiled would be the last film John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat would work on.  It's also the last film that Woo made before leaving Hong Kong for America.  The end of the ""Herioc Bloodshed"" era of Hong Kong Cinema.

I first saw this film sometime in the earlier 90's via my grandparent's neighbors.  Their dad was from Hong Kong and in addition to good home down Chinese cooking, an added bonus was watching cool HK flicks.  Not just Woo's stuff, but those groovy HK horror films, in addition to Jackie and Samo gung-fu action comdies.

Hard-Boiled stayed with me for days after first seeing it.  It was my first John Woo movie and it was the most out of this world action gun-fu fest that I had ever seen.  There's not much I can saw about this film that has not been written up often over the years.

If you are a fan of HK Cinema/Herioc Blooshed, chances are you have seen this.  If new to the genre this is an excellent entry point.

As far as the Dragon Dynasty release is concerned; this release is much better than Woo's The Killer.  The extras are slim but have a lot of information via interviews on the background and production of the film.  The picture and sound is a four out of five.  The film itself is a five.

181703,4,1559408677,"John Woo is definitely a poet when he comes to action, and he is no stranger to this exquisite action flick. Written and directed by Woo himself, Hard Boiled is perhaps one of the best action films ever made. The gun fu sequences are so elaborate and craftily choreographed that it becomes an astonishing eye candy festival.

In Hard Boiled, Chow Yung Fat plays Tequila, an over the edge super cop that will do what he can to stop crime from covering the streets. Early in the film we are introduced to another important player in the story, Alan (Tony Leung) an undercover cop working for the triads. He as well will do the impossible to bring down the organization.

The plot is not that original, it has been seen countless times in other films. Though Woo manages to take the plot and give it a couple of surprises here and there. The real magic however lies in the action sequences; which are arguably the best in any movie I have seen. Specifically a sequence in a burning hospital, which is a single handheld camera long take. This scene believe it or not lasts 2 minutes and 42 seconds. In that long take Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung alternately fight off enemies in a deliciously frenetic choreographed scene. The way they engage in emotional dialogue is superb. The scene goes through many corridors and rooms spanning two levels of the hospital, including an intervening elevator ride.

This is definitely a movie that is needed to be scene to be believed. The plot is not exactly Shakespeare...but then again we watch these type of flicks for the action than for the plot. This is a definitely must own by any action junkie. I recommend you get the Dragon Dynasty 2 disc Edition. It includes a vast amount of special features; along with a commentary by john woo himself. The Dragon Dynasty edition has been remastered in high definition, which presents a crisp and anamorphic transfer, much better than the previous edition.

The movie is more than a little silly.  A Chinese cop named Tequila who expresses his pain by playing the saxophone (without moving his fingers, by the way) in a hole-in-the-wall jazz club?  It's as if director John Woo and co-screenwriters Barry Wong and Gordon Chan decided to throw in every convention of the tough cop genre that they could glean from American movies.  Soon, however, the talent of the cast, the good humor of the plot, and the exuberance of Woo's direction won me over.  I wouldn't place this at the apex of action films--it's over-reliance on gunplay and explosions becomes tedious at times--but it is a very enjoyable film.  I've written before that I think John Woo is overrated, but that's only because so many lionize him as a god of the cinema.  He is ""merely"" a very talented action director who can deliver a good time at the movies--and there's nothing wrong with that.",1238284800,,1160,4.624390243902439

*The video/sound quality is great.  The picture is a bit grainy, but still clean, sharp, colorful, and vivid.
*Includes a commentary and a bunch of featurettes and interviews.
*Includes English dubbing, as well as the original Chinese and optional English subtitles.
*Contains a huge amount of great action scenes.  The last hour is especially awesome; it's like a nonstop sequence of shoot-outs.  Like any John Woo movie, it has a lot of slow-motion jumping and flying and crashing-through-glass, but none of it is hoaky or cliched (no darn doves either).
*Photography is good.
*Fight scene choreography is good.
*Production design (sets, props, costumes) were good.  One of the bad guys (who incidentally only had one eye) had a way cool gun.
*The story is good.
*The characters are quite good.  They are well-acted and well-written.
*Music is not bad.
*It dawned on me, as I was watching this, that this is the predecessor to the video game ""Stranglehold."" Cool.

The Bad Things
*I think the sides of the screen may have been cut off or something.  Other people seem to have a ""skewered"" image.  Either way, there's something weird about the aspect ratio.
*Subtitles translate only the English dubbing, not the original Chinese dialogue.
*Not for the squeamish; contains lots of bloody violence, brutality, and lots of swearing.

The Questionable Things
*Some things are quite absurd (I can't remember what specifically, but I remember seeing some of the action scenes and thinking ""yeah right!"").  If you prefer movies to be totally realistic, you may wind up laughing at a lot of things.  But if you can suspend disbelief, it's not so bad.
*The first hour had some slow parts to it.

Once, I said that ""Invisible Target"" resembled ""Die Hard,"" but now I see that I spoke way too soon.  This movie is much more like a Chinese ""Die Hard,"" and it's equally thrilling, if not moreso.  Although the first hour of this movie seemed a bit long, the second hour was a non-stop extravaganza of violent action.  Above all, it was well-made and John Woo's style is most original and fresh in this film.  This DVD edition is not the best, but I found it suitable; die-hard fans, or fans of Hong Kong cinema, may be dissapointed.  Still, highly reccomended to anybody who enjoys action!",1233273600,,2293,4.853470437017995
181717,5,1559408677,"Now, I haven't owned any other version of the dvd so I really can't play judge to the quality compared to the others but I can say this, this movie itself is a masterpiece. Not many people know, or even understand that this move help give birth to some of the widely popular action film style's that are used these day's. John Woo was using these styles in his films long before this one, but this was his breakthrough work, this was his first big hit in America. And beside the very artistic action, which non of this f-ing mother f-ing I've got an ak-47 with five million people trying to kill me I empty a clip while spinning in the air and hit them all B.S like most American films. All me and my friends agree that the action is this movie as a style all its own, the acting in this move is very good. Not just Chow yun-fat though he really gives you a great performance, but Anthony Wong, a very big big asian character actor gives a very powerful performance as the villain Johnny. And if that wasn't enough Tony Leung's character is very well done giving and he does a great job to bind all the characters together. Bullet time was first brought to the front with this movie as well. And please if you just start watching this movie think I mean time is almost going to stop and bullets are going to slowly move trough the air. I want to make this clear right now, THAT IS NOT BULLET-TIME! Bullet time does slow down the action a bit so you can see more vividly the littler action within the action, but it also works not to break with the pace of the film. This is why John Woo is a great director, the only thing I have to say against this movie is, if John Woo never made it, him and Chow Yun-Fat may never became big name american actors and they might still be doing movies of this caliber, not Mission Impossible II (Woo), and Pirate's of the Caribbean III (Yun-Fat).",1228348800,,1881,4.242339832869081
181718,5,1559408677,"As has been stated before, this was John Woo's last Hong Kong cinema work before going on to Hollywood. (In a way, I wish he'd stayed, his HK cinema flicks are masterpieces) This film rightfully takes it's place as one of the greatest action movie ever made. Woo tells the tale of a man working in the Hong Kong police department, Inspector Tequila. Tequila plays at the local Jazz Bar, and, having been dumped, spends a lot of time there. The movie begins with him playing a tune that acts as a sort of theme for parts of the movie. Tequila is on a case to find gun runners smuggling Chinese weaponry into the province, and ends up killing a lieutenant in the crime organisation, but not without loosing his partner. Embittered by his loss and inability to help more in the teahouse shootout, he proceeds to disobey orders to leave the case. Meanwhile, the other protagonist, a mob killer (won't say much, it spoils a major plot twist) makes a hit on a man who betrayed his boss, Uncle Hoi, to a major competitor by the name of Johnny Wong. Alan (the killer) will play a major role, and though the film may be rated by some as a stereotypical buddy cop action movie, it's nothing of the sort. Gunfights ranging from raiding a gun shop to saving a hospital make this an electrifying epic, and a fitting swan song to Woo's HK cinema flicks. I highly recommend this, but you might want to keep the kiddies away.",1221696000,,1409,4.444015444015444
181719,5,1559408677,"A quick note on the new Dragon Dynasty edition:  To me, the skewing of the aspect ratio was quite noticeable.  I thought there was something wrong with  my TV or DVD.  Until I got on the interweb and found others were having the same issue.  The people all appear to have gained 15lbs. (maybe they all just started college).  And the use of the dubtitles is pretty bushleague considering it's a DD release.  If you have either of the previous offerings there's no need to replace them with this one unless you must have the extras.

""Hard Boiled?"" I think not. We simply like to refer to this film as ""John Woo/Chow Yun Fat: Unleashed And Fully Funded"". Because that is exactly what this film is. The Scorsese and DeNiro of Hong Kong come together for the single greatest display of cinematic action in the history of the medium. And they certainly had to go through enough to get there. ""Once A Thief"". Two ""A Better Tomorrow"" flicks. ""The Killer"". How many classics does one have to turn out in HK before they finally agree to just let you at it?

Either way, HB is a film that sees John Woo at the peak of his action powers. The action is so loose, so massive, and so intricate that it may never be matched again. What's funny to think about is that this film only has three action sequences. That's it. It just so happens that the first one is about the size of any other major action film's closing action finale. After that, they just get bigger. Once you get to the third one, you can sit back and just watch the genius unfold for over 30 minutes solid.

But there is more to this film than just the action. The story is pretty engaging. I've always thought ""The Killer"" had a bit of a silly story. The hitman doing one last job so as to pay for eye surgery was always a little cheesy (don't get me wrong, it is probably the movie that would be occupying the ""greatest action movie"" slot had ""Hard Boiled"" not been made). But the story of a rogue cop and an undercover cop playing cat and mouse and eventually coming together to set it right plays out brilliantly. Also, one thing I rarely see mentioned is just how excellent Tony Leung's performance is. *mild spoiler* When he has to kill his own guy in front of the boss to keep his cover, and walks toward his boss in slo-mo with the smile on his face and then, as soon as he passes the boss, instantly goes to the verge of tears, that is incredible. That is first-rate, all the way. No amateur or stock action star could pull off that performance. *end spolers*

While I've always thought that the action in ""The Killer"" had a little more artistry and grace to it than ""Hard Boiled"", HB's action is pretty much fueled by rage and testosterone. It's possible that there have been modern-era wars that had less shots fired than this film. But the action in this film has what must be the most creative ""bullet ballet"" sequences ever. It's one thing to just have big and long action spots. But the massive puzzle that John Woo assembles here is like a ""how-to for gun-fu"". The centerpiece of this all being the several-minute, uncut, hand-held single shot that follows our two protagonists through the hospital, into and elevator, up a floor, and out onto a new floor, all while firing guns, reloading, diving, grabbing more guns, dodging, co-ordinating, etc... It must have taken a week just to set that shot up and rehearse it. That shot should go down in the history books.

There's really nothing more to say than just buy it. Seriously. Do you like action movies that have people shooting at one another? Great. This is the best one ever made. When I dropped this movie on the arthouse dorks in my film school, even they had to admit that it surpassed any and all other action flicks ever committed to celluloid (or digital, nowadays). See, the fact that it's Asian and subtitled means you can slip it past your artsy friends. So it's a win/win for everyone. Oh yeah, and Chow has to work on keeping his girlfriend happy, too. So, it's a romance as well. Now you can watch it with your girlfriend, too. It's such a brilliant movie that everyone wins. See, how can you go wrong?

One last thing I forgot to mention, if you have a ""Y"" chromosome, it is mandated that you see this film. I heard a rumor that Jewish boys have to watch this after their Bar Mitvah to fully complete the process of becoming a man. Some African tribes send their boys into the wilderness with nothing but a spear and a portable DVD player with this film on it in order to attain the ""rights of manhood"". It doesn't matter how old you are or what you do for a living. If you haven't seen this, you're not a man, yet. I think you get the point.",1221350400,4,4681,4.385236447520184

181722,3,1559408677,"Some brief back-story: I first experienced ""Hard Boiled"" in 1997 and, like all of it's fans, my jaw hit the floor. I had never seen anything like it in my entire life. Soon after seeing it, I bought the Hard Boiled/Killer VHS pack. That followed with ""A Better Tomorrow"" on VHS and ""A Better Tomorrow 2"" on DVD. Every so often, I would see the Criterion Collection version of ""Hard Boiled"" and ""The Killer"" but not wanting to shell out the money and believing it would be around forever I never picked it up.

Fast forward to 3 years ago when I make a concerted effort to own the best DVD versions of all the films I love. Believing that Criterion did it better then anyone, that's the one I wanted and that's when I discovered it was out of print. At that moment I made a vow to myself that I wouldn't watch either ""Hard Boiled"" or ""The Killer"" again until it was re-released on a special edition DVD.

Fast forward again to this July when I look in the weekly Best Buy ad and see ""Hard Boiled: The Ultimate Edition"". As quickly as my balloon became inflated, it was popped upon going online to read these facts about it:

1. It was not going to be presented in it's original aspect ratio.

2. Instead of upgraded subtitles, it would be subtitled with the script
from the dubbed version of the film.

3. No John Woo commentary track.

4. No interview or commentary track with Chow Yun-Fat about the film.

It was also disconcerting to read that no DVD version(not even the Criterion) of this classic was without it's flaws but more on that in a bit. Weighing my options, and feeling like a sellout, I purchased the Dragon Dynasty edition of the film.

This week, I finally got around to watching it. How do I feel about my four biggest reservations now?:

1. While not visually presented in the way that it was meant to be seen,
it is a MAJOR upgrade in quality over my VHS version.

2. To not have decent subtitles is ridiculous but the ""dubtitles"" weren't
so egregious that it ruined my enjoyment of the film.

3. The 37 minute interview with John Woo on Disc 2 almost completely made
up for not having a full length commentary.

4. Chow Yun-Fat was shown doing voiceover work for the game
""Stranglehold"" but not having him speak about his experiences during
shooting still bothered me.

In addition, I had a whole new appreciation for Tony Leung's performance after this viewing. I was disappointed he was not included on any bonus features.

A couple of more things before I give my summation...the Bey Logan commentary track gave me more information about Hong Kong cinema then I was ever going to find out otherwise. His enthusiasm and knowledge of the genre made me wonder why I haven't gotten more into Hong Kong cinema beyond a few John Woo films. This makes up for a few of his assertions about the film itself which are probably off the mark. The Terrance Chang, Philip Chan, and Kwok Choi interviews are insightful and entertaining. Overall, the location guide didn't give me a sense that I was seeing where ""Hard Boiled"" was filmed but that might just be because the landscape has changed so much.

In conclusion, I can't understand why no distributor of this film has ever given it the proper DVD release it deserves. Like the back of this version says, ""Hard Boiled"" is a landmark in film history and deserves to be treated as such. Why Dragon Dynasty failed to achieve this on their crack at it is beyond me. This means that fans have to compare and contrast the 4 or 5 different editions of the film that are out there and decide which one suits their individual needs the most. Therefore, all I can say is that the Dragon Dynasty version of ""Hard Boiled"" suited my needs the best because:

1. It was major upgrade in picture quality.

2. It wasn't the dubbed version of the film, just the ""dubtitles""
  (which still bother me but not enough to not enjoy it)

3. It has some cool bonus features(if not everything that I wanted).

4. I could walk into my local Best Buy and purchase it.

Until a true ""Ultimate Edition"" comes out(if it ever does) 10, 15, 20 years from now, I will be happy with this edition. But that doesn't mean you are going to be.",1193443200,7,4168,4.456578947368421
181723,3,1559408677,"I heard so much about Hard Boiled, and felt let down. It sure puts a lot of empty casings on the floor and cars in the air, but it takes itself far too seriously considering how lame some of the dramatic scenes are.

The heroic rescue of the baby at the end while our hero kills bad guys left and right says it all: Woo wants there to be justice and nobility, but it all seems corny in light of the incredibly over-the-top violence.

The fight scenes are indeed staged very impressively, and the squib boys were working overtime, but after a while it's boring. There's just too damn much shooting! Violence works when it frightens, not when it numbs.

But, if you need to see almost a million shots fired in two hours (30 minutes too long), here's your movie.",1192320000,4,759,4.368794326241135
181724,5,1559408677,Great Hong Kong gangster movie. The most gunfire I've ever seen in any movie. I thought Chow Yun Fat was great along with Anthony Wong as the villian. It's one of my top five favorite action films. A John Woo classic.,1191974400,,217,4.317073170731708
181725,5,1559408677,Item was shipped and arrived as expected and was in perfect condition -- everything worked out as was said,1191974400,,106,4.631578947368421
181726,5,1559408677,"Chow Yun-Fat is possibly the coolest gun-toting policeman (or gangster) to ever appear in any movie!  It looks like he is having such a good time blowing the bad guys away!  Even when he's shot, and he frequently is, it doesn't slow him down or dampen his spirit.  Usually chewing on a match and flashing the famous Chow Yun-Fat smile, it's impossible not to like this guy.  I think if you're a girl, you want to be with him and if you're a guy you just want to be him! He has one of the strongest and most charismatic personalities in movies today.

Hard-Boiled is thrilling from start to finish.  I've never seen a movie in this genre take place in a hospital.  It's really a stroke of genius, because it's so unexpected and kind of taboo -- putting all those innocent people -- and babies -- in danger.  Yet, it works!  I especially like Chow Yun-Fat blowing the bad guys away while carrying a small baby who seems to be having a great time!  The baby flashes a big smile every time Chow Yun-Fat's bullet hits its target, which means the baby has a big smile on its face almost all the time.  This baby has a big future ahead of it in movies.  He's a natural!

Tony Leung is terriffic in his role and also looks gorgeous!  This movie really doesn't have a down-side.  It has interesting characters, unexpected locales and tons of bullets and dead bodies!  It's an exciting violent fun film which keeps your interest from beginning to end.  You won't be checking your watch during this movie!",1191369600,,1494,4.4338235294117645
181747,4,1559408677,"Despite his success and acclaim, I was mainly introduced to John Woo films via Mission Impossible 2, Broken Arrow and Face/Off with the latter being probably my favorite. But then anytime somebody mentioned John Woo it was always followed by acclaim for his early Hong Kong output, namely that of the Killer and Hard Boiled. Well with the latter being re-released on DVD, I thought I'd check it out and I wasn't disappointed. Although the DVD package is less-than-ideal, the film itself is a great and entertaining watch.

Tequila (I know, weird name huh?) is a cop in Hong Kong haunted by the death of his partner during a teahouse shootout. Determined to wreak havoc on the Triad members and their leader, Johnny Wong, he starts taking the fight to them. But complicating matters is Alan who is an undercover cop who's currently on the rise within the gang. So Tequila and Alan have to figure out how to bring the gang and Johnny down while trying not to get killed or Alan exposed.

I mentioned this on the Face/Off review but John Woo shares something in common with reviled director Michael Bay: regardless of their faults, they do know how to stage great action sequences. In John Woo's case, he's in full swing with his trademarks which include slow motion, characters diving while shooting and things that go boom really big. Here he's in fine form which include the teahouse shootout, a warehouse gunfight and most specially, a long climax in a crowded and hostage-held hospital. Even if the whole cop-bent-on-revenge story has been done before, got to admit these are exciting scenes to watch.

My one complaint the story itself is that at times, the pace of it kind of drags. While an action movie has to have at least some story, here it feels underdeveloped with the only real thing of merit is the odd friendship that Tequila and Alan have. They bond and bicker but can also go to town on the bad guys like nobody's business but it's the stuff inbetween such as the animosity towards Tequila by his boss just doesn't feel compelling, or the possible scenario of Alan being found out. The big scenes are the payoffs but the story I felt needed a bit more punch to give the fights more of an emotional payoff rather than just bullets everywhere.

There's times where you buy a DVD and you notice the presentation seems forgetten as long as we get the film. Who cares about shimmery film stock, print flaws or weird editing glitches (nothing major, but the film at times feels it like it pauses for a second without a layer change) not to mention the subtitles feel very lackluster with some grammatical mistakes as well as just weird translations. Most people won't notice as long as they understand the story but other people might cry foul.

It's probably not my favorite John Woo film (I haven't watched them all but so far it's Face/Off) but this is very much a close second. But then again the film's so exciting and cool that it doesn't matter where it places, it's just good anyway.",1190592000,,3001,4.6440677966101696
181748,3,1559408677,"When Hard Boiled came out as a theatrical release I was blown away. It was utterly unlike any other film I had seen up to that point. Now though it's been imitated so many times, both by Hollywood and by Woo himself, it just doesn't hold up. It plays almost as a parody of itself.

It's worth seeing because it is such an important milestone, but don't be surprised if your memory of the film is stronger than the film itself.",1186790400,4,426,4.2592592592592595
181749,4,1559408677,"This was my first experience with a movie from the ""Heroic Gun Play"" genre.  I'm not a fan of American action pictures, so I had always shied away from John Woo's Hong Kong action flicks.  I now see that I have definitely missed some great movies (I'm female, so a bunch of guys shooting guns at one another was never something I thought I would get into).  I decided to give the movie a look because Tony Leung is my favorite actor at the moment and I knew that he co-starred in the film.  Actually, Leung and Philip Kwok Choy (the killer Mad Dog in the film AND the action director) steal every scene they share with Chow Yun-Fat.  Now I want to check out some of the Shaw Bros. films Kwok Choy was in to see more of this martial arts actor.

Maybe it is the surprising emotional complexity Leung brings to the film and the exhilerating action sequences (and that the killing looks so fake), but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  As a neophyte, the commentary and 3 interviews added to my understanding and enjoyment of the film.  Since this is a cult film, I understand that die-hard fans of Woo and this particular film might be disappointed in various aspects of the presentation (this isn't a Criterion 2-disc premium treatment, afterall).  But, as an introduction to this film, to Woo 's heroic gun play pictures and to the world of Hong Kong action films, it is as good a place to start as any.  I am definitely looking forward to viewing other John Woo HK films.",1186790400,,1469,4.4275092936802976
181750,5,1559408677,"For those of you lucky enough to own the Criterion Collection edition of this movie, you might want to hold onto your copy as none of the extras from that edition are included on this one. That being said, the video and audio on this version easily surpass any previous Region 1 incarnations making this edition a must-have for fans of the movie.

The first disc features an audio commentary by Hong Kong cinema expert Bey Logan. He shows off his impressive knowledge of HK geography by pointing out which locations in the film don't exist anymore and their significance in the country's culture. Logan also dishes out interesting factoids, like the teahouse in the opening sequence was going to be demolished and this happened right after they filmed the last scene in the place! As with other commentary tracks that he has done his encyclopedic knowledge about the film and HK cinema in general is quite impressive, making for an informative track.

Disc two starts off with ""A Baptism of Fire: A Featurette with Iconic Director John Woo."" He was a big fan of Steve McQueen in Bullitt and Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry and with Hard Boiled; he wanted to create his own Dirty Harry. Woo wanted to make Chow Yun-Fat like Eastwood's iconic character but with the Asian actor's warm charisma.

""Partner in Crime: An Interview with Producer Terence Chang."" He talks about how he met Woo in the late 1970s but that they didn't start working together until ten years later. Chang also talks about the genesis of the film which was originally a psycho who kills baby (?!). Fortunately, after they filmed the teahouse shoot-out, Chang convinced Woo to discard this idea.

""Art Imitates Life: An Interview with co-star Philip Chan,"" the actor who played Tequila's boss in the film. He was real policeman before getting into film and brought that authenticity to his role. He actually ran a team of undercover cops and speaks admiringly of working with Woo.

""Mad Dog Bites Again: An Interview with Leading Villain Kwok Choi."" He talks about working with Woo on the film. Originally, he was hired to only design the action sequences but Chow Yun-Fat recommended him to play the villain's right-hand man.

""Hard Boiled Location Guide"": takes us on a fun, fascinating tour of many of the locations from the movie. Some places, like the teahouse (which is now a mall), don't exist anymore and a little historical background is given to some of the places.

Also included are two trailers, the U.S. and Hong Kong versions.

Finally, there is ""Stranglehold Video Game Mini-Making Of."" This is the John Woo-approved sequel to Hard Boiled that allows you to play Tequila. This extra shows how deeply involved he was in the game's production with Chow Yun-Fat returning to provide the voice for his character!",1185840000,27,2792,4.838574423480084
181751,5,1559408677,"Undoubtedly one of the finest action films ever made, Hard Boiled tops every single slam bang, big budget, mainstream action film you have ever seen.  Chow Yun-Fat stars as a super tough cop on the trail of the murderous triad, only to learn that an up and coming triad soldier (Tony Leung) he has his sights set on is an undercover cop who gives the term deep cover new meaning.  As loyalties shift and the bullet and body count rise, the two team up and help provide some of the most dynamic and exciting action scenes ever put to film, including a standoff at a hospital that concludes in a barrage of blood, bullets, glass, and incredible carnage.  Before he came over to America and helmed watered down mainstream action films like Broken Arrow, Mission: Impossible 2, and Paycheck (personally, the only film of his I've liked that he's made over here is Face/Off), John Woo crafted the amazing action scenes that you've heard so much about with this film.  This double disc Ultimate Edition released under the Weinstein Company's Dragon Dynasty label features a nice selection of extras (yet no commentary from Woo or Chow Yun-Fat) including an examination of how much Hard Boiled has influenced the action genre over the years.  To this day Hard Boiled remains a masterpiece, and if you're an action junkie who has never seen the film before, you need to pick this up immediately.",1185667200,4,1387,4.738589211618257

And as for the subtitles,  they seem to be pretty much the same as the Criterion version which wasn't bad, but not anamorphic.  Unless you speak fluent Cantonese, how in the hell could you ever know which version was the most accurate?  This release has the best transfer of the film to date, and I've owned four copies of it including this Dragon Dynasty edition.  The colors are rich and the the images are sharp.  This is the best version for your money, unless you want to wait for the Blu-Ray edition.  I hate it!!!",1185321600,5,774,4.536231884057971
181753,3,1559408677,"Hard Boiled is one of the best action movies ever and every John Woo film from the 1980s is golden.  Hard Boiled has been released twice in the U.S. now, once from Fox Lobrar and once from Criterion, both are now out of print.  (Of course there are numerous companies in Asia selling the film currently, thank goodness for Ebay!)  I own both versions; the Criterion one has the best features but the picture is noticiably darker.  This version of Hard Boiled from Dragon Dynasty/Wienstein Company has an amazing picture, stand out colors, well lit dark scenes, and excellent detail.  If I was juding this film on color, brighteness, and overall picture, I would give it 5 stars.

However, there is one major flaw to the film somehow slipped through the cracks.  The original film's aspect ratio is 1.85:1; wide screen tvs at home are 16:9, or 1.78:1 (Standard tvs are 4:3 or 1.33:1).  Because 1.85 is wider than 1.78:1, you will have small black bars on the top and bottom of a widescreen tv, this is normal.  For some reason, they decided to turn this movie into widscreen 16:9, and what this means is images on the sides as well as top and bottom are cut off slightly.  Imagine looking at a photograph and then zooming in about 7 percent all around, essentially this is what has happened here.  The film is still viewable, but artistic quality is compromised because the image is being cut off all around.

As for this release, the menus are good and the special features looked neat, I haven't had time to watch them yet.

Hopefully by releasing this movie many people will get to see the film for the first time.  Just be aware that the movie is not in its original format and that the image is cut off slightly on the top, bottom, and sides.",1185235200,50,1746,4.519108280254777
181754,2,1559408677,"IMPORTANT NOTE: This review was written for the Dragon Dynasty DVD VERSION of this film, but thanks to Amazon's bizarre practise of porting reviews from one product platform to another product platform with no regard to differences between them, there's a good chance you're reading this review on the Blu-ray listing for this title. Having seen the Blu-ray version, I can say with absolute certainty that it is only a VERY MODEST improvement over the DVD in terms of picture quality. While I have neither the time nor inclination to review the Blu-ray, I would direct you to the extremely informative review at DVD Beaver (dot com), and concur 100% with the ""disappointment"" label given this release. What is most puzzling is the loss of the trailer gallery available on the earlier DVD set. Strange that a format that actually holds more is, in this case, used to hold less!

The remainder of this review is for the previous DVD special edition, which the new Blu-ray does little to better:

There should be no doubt that HARD BOILED is a phenomenal action picture, one of the best ever produced in Hong Kong. Much has been written all over the internet about it in the years since it was released direct-to-video in North America in the very early 90's.

Now, some 16 years later, through any number of flawed prints, alternate edits, crummy dubs and subtitles of varying quality, not to mention several PREVIOUS special editions on DVD, each with their own pros and cons, the chance to do right by this film in so many ways is, typically, blown by the Weinstein machine and their cabal of Hong Kong cinema experts.

Oh, sure, this disc is watchable, and considering there is now a generation of teenagers out there who weren't even BORN when this was released, I'm sure there will be new fans made from watching this film. But the film ain't the problem for the rest of us.

Who in their right minds, in 2007, puts DUBTITLES on a ""premium"" special edition of possibly one of the most important Hong Kong motion pictures of all time. DUBTITLES based on a dub that was made, what, 16 years ago now? That dubbed version was indeed responsible for bringing a great many western fans into the fold, but that doesn't mean we liked it. Or any dubbing for that matter. Just because HARD BOILED is over half action sequences doesn't automatically mean the dialogue sequences are unworthy of even a moderately more accurate translation of WHAT THE CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY SAYING IN CANTONESE. Instead, they appear to have paid the receptionist a few bucks to type the original dub script verbatim into the subtitle stream.

Thankfully, far superior subtitles are still available on other, BETTER DVD releases of the film. Some of which even have an image where Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Chow Yun-fat DON'T look like they've put on about 50 pounds!! I'm no expert on aspect ratios and the like, but I know enough, and I've seen enough Chow and Leung movies to know that they don't quite look like this in real life. Gotta wonder who's bright idea it was to CROP the movie, then STRETCH it back to the proper aspect ratio. I can think of a few people who probably figured no one would notice, or if they did, that they'd just be the usual internet pedants.

If that's what I am, so be it, but for god's sake, you think a label that so eagerly wants to be viewed as the top shelf for Hong Kong and Asian movies, would actually start treating those very products with some REAL respect. But then again, look what they did with their ""edit"" of the Protector. Laughable. And to hear the commentator on that one JUSTIFY the cuts tells me where he really stands when it comes to his paymasters' wishes. This edition of HARD BOILED is another clue.

If I were just reviewing the film, I'd give it 5 stars. But since this is a DVD review, and I managed to find one at a store that broke street date, AND I'm now out about [...] for something I now know I DIDN'T NEED TO UPGRADE, the best I can muster is (a generous) two stars, largely for the interviews on the second disc, which are not bad, and the location tour, which is not without interest.

The commentary on the other hand, while not a total write-off, obviously, offers SOME interesting tidbits that are tangentially related to the film itself, but to save a list of errors and 'best guesses' that would make your eyes glaze, just dig up a copy of the old Fox Lorber DVD from and listen to this film's CREATORS, John Woo and Terence Chang contradict Dragon Dynasty's commentator on several occasions. Or listen to the track on the Criterion edition of this title, where they do the same thing (though in fairness, the Fox Lorber track may have been a longer, uncut version of the Criterion one, only minus Roger Avery and Dave Kehr). John Woo and Terence Chang MADE the film, so who should you trust? A self-anointed expert? Sure, he means well enough, and he knows more than I do (which is why I'm a lowly peon who doesn't do commentaries ;)  ), but a lot of the less film-specific stuff on this track feels awfully familiar...

Watch this disc for the movie (in Plump-o-Vision) and the interviews. Then do a little surfing to find one of the superior international versions if you really feel you need an ""ultimate edition"" in your collection, 'cause this ain't it.",1184716800,245,5309,4.589662447257384
181755,4,1559408677,"One of the best shoot 'em up, bang, bang movies that keeps you wanting more.  I happened upon this movie when it first came out on VHS(yes, I have been a fan that long) and replaced it on DVD when it was first offered on disc.  I couldn't believe how many people hadn't seen this work of art by John Woo, but after viewing it, they fell in love and had to have this movie as well.  Hang on for the ride and you won't be disappointed!!",1184025600,,434,3.9655172413793105
181756,5,1559408677,"The movies don't get much better than this, folks. John Woo (the real John Woo, not the body snatcher who made `Paycheck') brings us a true cinematic masterpiece that will leave you on the edge of your seat, salivating, and praying that the ride will never end.

""Give him one gun, and he's superman; give him two, and he's God,"" is one the characters description of Chow Yun-Fat's character Tequila; in typical John Woo fashion, he's invincible and brooding, with a tell-tale back story of sorrow and loss. Although devoid of martial arts, the slow-mo gun fights more than make up for it, and keep the movie running along a breakneck speed, a true paragon of action and intensity. Tequila is more Chow Yun-Fat than the haunted cop he's made out to be, but the rest of the characters are pretty well developed between the ample shoot outs, and there's even a neat bit about paper cranes. In fact, the paper cranes just about the most memorable scene in the movie, and are what really push the movie over the edge from just ""Great"" to ""Unforgettably SpottieOttieDopilicious"".

While Hard Boiled could have taken a wrong turn and been just a mediocre, shoot-`em-up action flick, it instead excelled, and completely redefined what ""Stylistic"" means to this genre: Just plain Cool.

The Bottom Line: With all the extras promised in this special edition, the Ultimate Edition of Hard Boiled is a must have for anyone not suffering from dementia.",1183334400,3,1440,4.821862348178137
181767,3,1559408677,"Hard Boiled was the last film John Woo did on location in Hong Kong before his eventual move to Hollywood. Part reaction to the escalating violence Hong Kong was experiencing at the time, the film pays homage to the Hong Kong Police.

Starring Chow Yun Fat and Tony Lueng as two policeman out to stop an arms smuggling triad. The two actors exhibit all of the characteristics of any actor in Woo film. Woo also uses his trademark filmmaking style and ulta violence to make his points. Look for freeze frames and Sam Peckinpaugh like slow motion throughout the film.

This is not for the squeamish or those not fond of gun violence. Approximately 100,000 blanks were fired making the film and the body count tops 200. Part of the point here is that violence affects us all. Bystanders are not spared by Woo. The only hope may lie in the next generation. Woo states in his commentary track that this is why he often employs infants in his films. Woo says that he was angered with the Hong Kong situation at the time of filming and his anger shows.

The version I viewed was the Winstar edition. The quality of the transfer was fine but the subtitling could have used some improvements. However, we find out in the commentary that Woo is not too concerned with dialogue he would rather have images tell the story. The sound is also adequate. We have a mono track that would really be improved by at least a stereo remaster. This is not the best edition of the film out there but unless you are willing to shell out the big bucks for the out of print Criterion this is the best you are likely to get.

This edition has production notes and filmographies, trailers for Hard Boiled and The Killer and an excellent commentary track by Woo and Terrence Chang.

181772,4,1559408677,"This was the last film John Woo made in Hong Kong before he left for Hollywood (which has royally screwed him over, but that's another review).  Many people debate whether Hard Boiled or The Killer are Woo's best.  My money is on The Killer, but I still really admire the hell out of this film.  It has some of the most amazing action sequences ever committed to celluloid.  Are they realistic?  Absolutely not.  One of the funniest things about Woo films is that the characters rarely, if ever, reload their guns.  The teahouse shootout is a great example.  Yun-Fat picks up the bad guys' guns, and fires at least 40 rounds or so with each gun.  Automatic guns hold 10 bullets or so in a clip, so where Yun-Fat found the extra clips is unknown at this point.  The plot of this film leaves quite a lot to be desired.  The film was a troubled production.  The original script had Tony Leung's character as a pyschotic killer who was planning on poisoning little children by tampering with baby formula.  After shooting the teahouse shootout, the film shut down for a month, and a major rewrite took place.  They ended up making Leung's character an undercover cop.  This was due to the fact that Chow Yun-Fat thought the Hong Kong public would find a baby killer too disturbing.  Woo agreed, and shut down the film (Hong Kong films are quite similar to Hollywood in that respect).  A lot of this film doesn't make an ounce of sense when Leung's character kills many people, just in order to stay in character.  I'm not really sure about that.  Thematically, the film is a mess.  But the opening shootout at the teahouse, the warehouse raid, and the utterly amazing shootout at the hospital (it lasts nearly 45 minutes, including an unbroken take of 2 minutes and 42 seconds) make this film worthwhile.  This film didn't have as much depth as Woo's other Hong Kong work, but it still manages to outdo all Hollywood films in terms of character and depth.",1167091200,2,1951,4.58092485549133

The dvd is GOOD!! It contains many trailers of previous Jonh Woo movies like The Killer and A Better Tomorrow, Jonh Woo filmoghraphy, notes from Hard Boiled, guide of Hong Kong crime films, Chinesse and English languages, audio commentary and more.

P.S: Some of the action scenes are very LONG, and of course: Chow Yun Fat also use different guns like shotguns and rifles.

181774,5,1559408677,When i first saw this movie about 5 years ago i was in a stunned awe. No way could i have waited so long to see this masterpiece. I was instantly a Chow fan and a John Woo fan. The gunfights were unbelievable-my jaw was on the floor! From the tea house to the climactic hospital bulletfest i was totally absorbed in it. Even 13 years after its release i still cant find one that measures up to it (except for maybe Woo's other great flicks The Killer and A Better Tomorrow 2) anyone who is a huge action fan like me MUST add this to their collection. this movie confirmed to the world that Chow Yun-Fat IS the world's coolest actor. The cast is perfect from Tony Leung as the seemingly lost undercover cop/triad to Phillip Kwok as the coolest badguy youll find in movies.

181775,5,1559408677,"I was all prepared to rate ""Hard Boiled"" as a slightly above average Hong Kong shoot-em-up that was entertaining but nothing that would distinguish it from similar fare.  Then director John Woo serves up an inspired finale in a hospital that has to rank as one of the most ingenious action segments in screen history.  The set-up is that some gangsters have stashed an arsenal in the hospital morgue.  The police have uncovered the operation which leads to a stand-off between them and the hoods.  Caught in between are the hospital staff, the patients, and some oh-so-cute newborn babies.  The less said the better.  Nevertheless, Woo throws out the rulebook as to what can be done in an action film.  Woo was essentially toying with us for the first hour or so in order to throw at us this delicious curveball.  I can imagine some people revulsed by this segment.  Personally, I was awestruck and grateful for an artist like Woo for taking a risk.",1131062400,,949,4.703030303030303

Many of Woo's early films deal with male bonding and this one is no different. The plot is straightforward. The local mob is engaged in gun smuggling and a new, young guy is muscling his way up. Unbeknownst to him, one of his new trigger men is an undercover cop, deep cover. Meanwhile another cop on the force ('Tequila' played by Chow Yun Fat) is a Dirty Harry kind of cop who shoots first and asks questions later and keeps endangering the undercover cop and refuses to back off despite being told by his superiors. The two cops finally hook up, and in a massive fight in a hospital that is used as part of the gun smuggling operation, get the bad guy but in the process the undercover cop dies.

I have seen this movie a dozen times and never tire of the action sequences. I am surprised Tarantino hasn't ripped off err I mean 'been influenced' by this movie. I wish Woo would remake this in English, it would be much better than some of his more recent films.

181793,4,1559408677,"While not quite as tightly plotted or emotionally compelling as John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat's magnum opus ""The Killer,"" ""Hard Boiled"" is still sure to please fans of that movie.  Much of what made ""The Killer"" such a great film is to be found here: flawed heroes, murky allegiances, and ambiguous morals are once again the order of the day in this tale of cops and criminals living on the edge.  At the same time, ""Hard Boiled"" manages to ratchet up the violence even further from its ""sister"" film, resulting in the most prolonged and intense action scenes I've ever witnessed, all filmed in Woo's signature frenetic style.  A tea house, a warehouse, and ultimately a hospital all become battlegrounds in all-out war as the cops face an enemy that makes the Mafia look like a group of middle-school bullies.
Once again, Chow takes the lead in the protagonist's role, this time portraying relentless Hong Kong inspector ""Tequila"" Yuen. In true Woo-hero fashion, Tequila can shelter a baby with one arm while shooting up a small army of bad guys with the other.  Joining him in his fight against the triads is Tony (Tony Leung) an undercover cop who's spent so much time working among gangsters that the line between the right side of the law and the wrong one is becoming blurred.  However, Tony looks like a choirboy compared to the cartoonishly villanous Johnny Wong, an up-and-coming Triad boss who would probably kill his own mother if she got in his way.  Johnny also has himself an extremely menacing sidekick in the form of a glowering, nameless enforcer who spends much of the film with a patch on one eye and still manages to give Tequila and Tony a few runs for their money.
It all comes to a head in the climactic showdown in the hospital-turned-arsenal, with the scene gradually evolving from tense standoff to full-scale shootout as the lives of hundreds of hostages hang in the balance.  As most of Hong Kong's police force provides support, the two detectives lead the way against Johnny, his cycloptic colleague, and dozens of other gun-wielding menaces.  And did I mention they have to make sure no harm comes to the adorable newborn babies in the nearby maternity ward?  Yeah, Tony and Tequila sure have their work cut out for them as they fly through the air and unleash zillions of bullets, but it makes for some scintillating watching.
On the whole, ""Hard Boiled"" is definitely an engaging experience that's more than worth the money I shelled out for it.  Much like ""The Killer,"" this movie manages to pack much more  psychological depth than the typical Hollywood shoot-'em-up with its portrayals of compromised heroes in harrowing circumstances.  And of course, it goes without saying that Woo is nearly unparelelled when it comes to putting together action set pieces.  Woo has made some moderately entertaining movies here in the States, but he hasn't managed to reach the level of his twin Hong Kong masterpieces.

Nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of bullets that are used in this film - all done to an impeccable action style that has still not been beat. If there was ever a Guinness Book of Records for the ""Most bullets shot in a film"" John Woo's Hard Boiled would be first place for a very long time. It is a terrible shame that this director has only been toned-down by Hollywood. There is not a hope that he would be allowed to do what he has done here with Hong Kong actors to the Hollywood cream of the crop. It seems that it is okay to have a Hong Kong Asian to shoot the hell out of everything but this same action when applied to Western culture would only shock and shame. The same can be said for the star of Hard Boiled - Chow Yun-Fat (Crouch Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who since moving to the West has fired less bullets in all his Hollywood films put together than he does in the first five minutes of this film. Does that really matter? In many ways - Yes it does. Unlike THEIR Hollywood films the gun violence here is not gratuitous. It is artistic and warrented. No one can come away from this film to say that have seen unjustified and unnecessary amounts of actions. It is all integral to the style and plot of this movie. Yes, innocent people do get mowed down in a hail of hot lead and yes the violence is bloody, but is that not what gun violence is? Here you see exactly what guns do to people. Forget Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" - The true message of gun control is right here! The plot is even about the dangers of gun smuggling!
One thing for sure is that there is more gratuitous gun violence in most Hollywood productions than there is here. Here we have a hard boiled cop who is assigned to tracking down gun smugglers. He is a hard boiled cop because he knows how to use his guns. His superiors are using him to fight fire with fire. The action gets going from the word go as the hard boiled cop busts a gun dealing operation. His buddy cops and innocent people get killed in the process. He then goes to extract some revenge and put the big gun runners out of business - only problem is there are literally thousands of them he must cut down. Cue unrelenting battle sequences from start to finish all done in excellent style and slow-mo. You have not seen anything like Hard Boiled before, nor will you again. The ending in the hospital is like DIE HARD with ten thousand times more suspense.
Hard Boiled is also a wonderfully acted movie with excellent first rate action direction. The story is also coherent and good, especially for an Asian production. This is every action fans wet dream. Believe me if you have not seen Hard Boiled then it is about time that you did.

181815,5,1559408677,"BEST. ACTION. MOVIE. EVER. PERIOD!  Shining endorsements aside, Hard Boiled really is one of the finest action movies ever made, and as John Woo's Hong Kong swan song, the pinnacle of his action film career.
The story is fairly simple. Tequilla, a hard boiled cop to do Mickey Spillane proud, is out to nail the head of a local gun-running triad (read: Chinese mob) over the death of his partner. He runs afoul of a planted police agent who has become so deeply entrenched in his triad cover that he even kills the head of a rival gang, and the two must eventually team up to defeat the psychotic triad boss and his gang of gun toting thugs.
The opening minutes are sheer action ecstasy as a stakeout of a local tea house quickly turns into a shootout where tons of innocent bystanders and policemen are caught in machine gun fire and that ends with a flour-covered Tequilla putting a point-blank shot into the crook's head. Talk about intense action and imagery! Later action scenes take place in one triad's smuggling warehouse (into which Tequilla drops and singlehadedly takes on and wipes out most of the bad guys) and the climatic hospital-filled-with-babies-and-invalids sequence occupying perhaps the last 45 minutes of the film.
The film delivers all anyone could want, from one-liners to intense action--and for those wanting something artistic, the film gives us Tony's (the undercover triad/cop) story of wanting to escape the darkness for somewhere it's always light, and Tequilla's mission to not fail his partner again.
As for the DVD, the video transfer is fine. However, there is not yet a 5.1 channel version out there--and since other John Woo films made in Hong Kong have 5.1 sound, I can't believe there aren't tracks out there for a suitable mix. Still, the film is so outstandingly outrageously supreme in terms of action that I STILL rate it at 5 stars overall, for to do anything less would be an insult to the film.",1057190400,2,1941,4.794029850746269

Hard Boiled is another one of John Woo's greats, created in 1991. Chow Yun Fat is a hard boiled cop, and he's hot on the trail of gun smugglers. The plot REALLY leaves a lot to be desired, but that doesn't matter. What matters is nearly half of the film is composed of relentless, hyperkinetic action.
The only negotiating is done through the barrel of a gun, and it is clearly evident in the entire film. People are killed left and right, including helpless civilians. But to the true action fan, this is a dream come true. This movie is a lesson in truly great action scenes, including the last scene in a hospital, where it is nonstop action for almost half an hour.

The action is cheoreographed by Phillip Kwok who plays Mad Dog in the film.
The cast does their job well. Chow Yun-Fat is at his superman best in this film. Woo even finds moments of laughter between him and his girlfriend. Tony Leung shares a quality with Chow Yun-Fat that I love in an actor. They can both commute emotions perfectly with their faces, and they do it without it seeming contribed or fake.

181838,5,1559408677,"This was the very first John Woo movie I ever saw. After that, I never looked at movies in the same way. This film is jam-packed with so much energy and excitement, it promises an experience that most movies rarely ever deliver(especially in the action genre).  It's just that good.  I don't want to ruin the movie for you, so I won't go into the plot much, but I will go into why it is so great.  First off, it's directed by John Woo, who is the very best director to come out of Hong Kong.  To him, a gunfight is not merely people standing around, shooting at each other; instead, it's a graceful, almost beautiful dance of death. Woo knows that the key to great action sequences is objects in motion, and he packs true emotions into them(just as all the great directors have done).  Secondly, it has Chow Yun-Fat in the lead, as the tough super-cop, Tequila.  Chow is an outstanding actor, and delivers his usual tough-guy performance as the gunslinging antihero; toothpick in his mouth, twin 45's blazing.  But, like all of the great action stars, there's more to it than that, and Chow brings something to the role that few other actors could. And lastly, Chow's costar is Tony Leung, a cold hitman who is more than he seems.  It's hard to outshine somebody like Chow Yun-Fat, but Tony Leung almost does. His performance is beyond words, and it's where most of the movie's moral themes are derived from. In closing, Hard-Boiled is the best action movie ever.  It's story may not be as complex as some of Woo's other masterpieces, but it's still better than almost any other action film.  And the action set-pieces are the best ever committed to the silver-screen. So do yourself a favor and see this movie. Now.",1051228800,4,1716,4.5602605863192185
181839,5,1559408677,"I often feel that it is a total shame that Hong Kong legend John Woo moved to the United States to start directing; if his Hong Kong magnum opus was any indication, then we might have missed out on some of the best action films ever instead of receiving movies like the dopey Face/Off and the watered down Mission Impossible 2.
Hard Boiled centers on two ""hard boiled"" cops battling a gun runner. The amazing opening shootout in a teahouse alone easily surpasses the entire action content of most American action movies, with hunderds of bullets and a couple dozen bodies being strewn about within seconds. Woo makes great use of Chow Yun-Fat here as his cop, with a .45 in each hand, quickly and with great visual flair shoots the bad guys to pieces, including an eye opening slide down a stair well. The movie would have been good for the opening shootout alone!
Of course, it doesn't stop being good there. With every sucessive action scene, the body count, brutality, and the visual bullet buffet increases three fold until a stunningly good half hour battle in a hospital that has more gun toting badguys than patients. Woo makes it all come together perfectly, often having elaborate shootouts take place in only a few takes!

From the first action sequence in a tea-house where Chow slides down a banister wielding his two pistols(front cover) to the last action sequence (30 or so minutes long) in a hospital, you are in for the greatest shoot-em up flick of all time. My best friend and I tried to keep a kill count, impossible with this movie. Despite the action and carnage there is also a real plot behind the movie and many metaphors for the life of John Woo. This was the first Chow Yun Fat flick I watched, and every film of his I have seen after has never come close to Hard Boiled.

That lot's of violence doesn't make it better. This movie makes you brutal too. If you
have made the mistake to order it then buy a romantic movie or a comedy to keep the balance.
(Example the Crazy/Beatiful a nice one.)
  And this was not that exciting action movie. Sometimes it was boring what changed to blood, and so on. The english dubbed is simple horrible.
  If you wanna buy an action movie where you are made to stick in front of the screen
 then buy a Schwarzennegger movie. If you like martial arts, buy the Royal

Jam-packed with tons o' gun fights and people getting cut down to bloody ribbons,the movie has some of the most extreme action sequences you are likely to see and is extremely well-paced. While most fans will suggest the hospital shoot-out finale as the milestone of the movie,I myself found the opening tea house shoot-out equally as entertaining and mesmerizing (though I do  also admire the finale). One can't help but be almost hypnotized by the brutal yet beautifully filmed cinematography of John Woo's films,as he is a truly visionary film-maker and one of a kind. Hard Boiled is a classic that should be in every action fans film library. And if this film isn't in your collection,do yourself a favor and buy it. Don't even rent it. Just buy it.

On a whim, I picked up ""Hard Boiled"" with Chow Yun Fat after seeing him in Crouching Tiger and taking a liking to him. I'm a big fan of explosive action films and this one is just that. If you're a fan of a lot of action, violence and explosions and want to see it stunningly choreographed, then this movie might just be for you. There is plenty of it and it is all done very well. John Woo is an excellent director and proves his skills in this film as far as the high octane action goes. My favorite scene is near the beginning when Tequila (Chow Yun Fat) is getting shot at and he slides across a table filled with flour. Excellent!
However, there was a few things I didn't like about the movie: I think the story was a little weak and a little hard to follow at times. (Keep in mind that I watched the English dub version, so the story could have lost a lot in the translation [I hate subtitles])
The dvd: The dvd is not very good. The picture is very grainy and has a lot of artifacting and scratches. The sound is low and slightly muffled. For a Hong Kong movie I guess it's not that bad, but looking at it alone, it's not very good. There are several extras to wet your whistle with though and that's always a plus.

In just one minute I was completely blown away!  I couldn't keep my self from drooling while just staring in astonishment!  The whole movie was everything I could ever hope for in an action flick.

Ruthless but with a sensitive side (renegade cop by day, musician by night) he's soon on the trail of a gang of gun smugglers. It's a fairly simple story, with just enough of a plot to sustain the viewer in between the epic gun fights and action sequences which are stunning enough to eclipse even those in ""The killer"". When Tequila's partner is killed during the first of many spectacular shoot-outs, he vows revenge. And after that there's so much action you soon lose count of the exploding cars, never mind the bodies and bullets.

181858,5,1559408677,"HARD BOILED is the last movie directed by John Woo in Hong-Kong, his native country. And the movie is a dazzling testament of this director who did more for the recognition of the cinema of Asia than Akira Kurosawa, Satiajit Ray and Kenji Mizoguchi together. Like these masters, John Woo is a writer-director, like these masters, John Woo explores the particular moral codes of his people in his films but unlike these masters, he specialized in a genre that is usually not the cup of tea of the intelligentsia : the action movie.
The Cinema of John Woo is the cinema of the last frontier. John Woo's movies are modern westerns without deserts or glorious landscapes, his movies are claustrophobic : there are more guns, more bad guys, more policemen stuck in Woo's saloons than in the whole movie production of John Ford and Howard Hawks. And when all these guys begin to shoot, John Wayne or Gary Cooper wouldn't have had the slightest chance against them. Because the John Woo hero, in order to survive, needs more than a star on his chest or God's benediction. He must cross the frontier.
He must cross a frontier, Law, Honor, Self-respect, Friendship, make your choice. The character of Allan, played by a great Tony Leung, is the perfect example of the impersonation of a John Woo hero ; he's working for the Hong-Kong police, he's an insider and should follow the moral codes, written or not, of his employer. But, in order to survive, he will have to kill in cold blood his aging boss. He has crossed the frontier but in the same time saved his own life. For the time being.

The final gun battle, with many casualties, in the hospital was just mind blowingly violent that it leaves you stunned with eyes glued to the screen.

181885,5,1559408677,"Let me start off by saying that my two favorite action movies are The Killer and Hard Boiled. Each movie is action packed and are both directed by John Woo. John Woo is one of the greatest directors of all time. He has made three of my favorite action movies, the two I mentioned above and Face/Off(NOT A HOCKEY MOVIE!!!). There is something about those two Hong Kong masterpieces that the American Face/Off just doesn't have. There is a certain kind of style and flare that is aparrent in both The Killer and Hard Boiled that Face/Off just couldn't acheive, although it is an amazing action movie nonetheless. As for which is better, The Killer or Hard Boiled, I can't say. They are both amazing in their own ways.
  Well about Hard Boiled, it has the most action ever to be seen in one movie. That is not exactly why it is one of my favorite action movies though. The amount of action in a movie does not exactly tell you how good the movie is because of a couple reasons. The first reason is that the action may not be quality action. In this case though it definitely is quality action. Next, their maybe a lot of action, but the story may be so horrible that the film may be ruined by it. However in Hard Boiled the story is good enough to not ruin the movie. The story is not amazing or anything, but it is okay enough and involves a lot of scenes that call for lots of action which makes it watchable. The action scenes are the best part and no one does a good action scene like John Woo. A good example of John Woo's directing and a story that makes the movie almost unwatchable is M:I-2. The problem with the story in that movie was that it didn't involve enough action, but the reason the movie was saved was John Woo made every non-action scene seem more interesting than it actually was. In that movie you can clearly see his directing talents... he even turned a scene where two people were originaly going to be talking into a car chase scene! In M:I-2 though you only see his talents yearning for some action where his true talents are unleashed. This movie is the most action packed movie ever, so John Woo's talents are fully unleashed. There is almost no stunt that cannot be found in Hard Boiled and almost no scene that doesn't involve action. Hard Boiled may very well be the best action movie ever made and is definitely in the top two alongside The Killer, another John Woo acion extraveganza. I must warn people out there looking to buy this movie, if you are buying a VHS of this stay away from the subtitled, the quality of the video is much worse than the dubbed. Plus I personally would rather hear people talking than have to read what they are saying. Overall though if you have a DVD player and do not own The Killer or Hard Boiled I suggest getting the two disc John Woo collection featuring those two movies, since they are, in my opinion, the two best action movies ever made.",997315200,4,2910,4.367158671586716

I asked one of my changed friends about the quality of ""Kiss Of The Dragon.""  ""It was good,"" he said. ""But it wasn't Hard Boiled good.""  That's usually the response I get now, and I have to explain to any confused parties that, no, he wasn't talking about his breakfast.

181888,5,1559408677,"Hard Boiled is the movie where the master's of modern Hong Kong cinema put together THE best action movie outside US (and you could rightly say inside the US as well).  It was this movie that finally got hollywood's full attention and brought the two over to the America.  The production value is top notch and the DVD has a cornucopia of features.
The action scenes are briskly paced from the start, and the opening scene with Chow Yun Fat going after the gun runner in the tea house is only topped by the incredible action sequence midway through the movie when Chow Yun Fat's character finally meets up with Tony Leung's under cover cop.  I'm not a big fan of spoiling the scenes, suffice to say the powerful impact of them doesn't diminish with watching. Woo's choice of using jazz was criticized in Hong Kong, but I disagree, it really adds a great flavor to the movie.  And there are no cheesy Hong Kong music cuts anywhere in the movie.  It is also a bit ironic that many critics in Hong Kong saw the movie as too dark, which I can only say compared to what Bullet to the Head or The Killer.  It just goes to show what critics know.
Tony Leung's performance as an angst driven undercover cop would have gotten him an Oscar here in my humble opinion.  It was a much better and more coherent part than Chow Yun Fat's similar character in City on Fire.  The choices he has to make, who he ends up killing torment him and you can continue to argue over the choices he made.  There is almost no 'right' choice.
Some of the themes in this movie are of course similar throughout the genre and you can't help but laugh when the classic argument about cops and criminals is lifted from just about every Clint Eastwood movie.  The ending is a bit over the top - but almost restrained compared to a Bullet to the Head. Otherwise a perfect collabaration, and having seen my share of Hong Kong movie's this is one of the few 5 stars I would give out.",996019200,,1944,4.345303867403315
181889,5,1559408677,"I watched A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, and Hard-Boiled in that order, and each one builds a momentum and quality that the next film tops. I definitely recommend watching these films in that sequence, as the intensity of stunning cinematography, action drama, and character additions deepens.
A poster said that John Woo's dialogue is juvenile - I wonder whether he knows Cantonese or can even grasp the slang and nuances of the urban language of Hong Kong. A Cantonese speaker will probably testify that his scripts are quite savvy and smart. The pity is that Hong Kong slang, as in any foreign language (depending on what's foreign to you), is untranslatable. The timing of the jokes, retorts, and reflections is hard to faithfully translate without disrupting the meaning of the characters' words. Let's just say the English translation for the film is awful. The trade-off of reading a text or even watching a movie of a language different than your own is that a lot is butchered and obscured, demeaning the art piece's full glory.
Well, John Woo himself said he doesn't know much about gangsters. He's merely using his characters - often chivalrous and struggling with their conscience - to express his philosophy of a lost world of traditional values where the believer of those values is destroyed in a heroic tragedy. It's disputable to say that his gangster characters are a parody or not; some yes, some no. The actors portray the gangsters I've come across quite well; the gangsters' grandiose, crude, and ruthless mannerisms and ethics sketch a strong parody of them. However, I don't think the characters of ""Alan"" (Ah-Long in Cantonese) or ""Joe"" in The Killer are intentional parodies. Gangstar action films sell, but a straightforward, didactic story about the loss of idealized code of honor and ethics probably won't. But a gangstar flick coupled with some mourning for the lack of forthrightness in a Social Darwinist world by some memorable cops and gangsters sells remarkably well. The main characters are tragic heroes who experience intense agony and strive for honor in a heartless environment.
I'm a big John Woo fan, so can't get too objective. All I can say is - SEE IT!",995068800,,2198,4.959349593495935
181890,4,1559408677,"And I say that without any fear of hyperbole.
In spite of the glowing reviews, Woo is in fact one of the worst directors of drama in history.  His scripts and dialog are best described as juvenile, his ""characters"" are nonsensical parodies of bad soap-opera.  Broken Arrow and Face/Off are as good as he'll ever get in terms of dialog and drama.
But his ACTION masterpiece is Hard Boiled.  As bad a dramatist as Woo is, he handles action like no one else.  He is the master, and Hard Boiled is his masterpiece.  The big problem with Hard Boiled is that people who haven't seen it think The Matrix is really good (it's actually a cheap copy).

181893,3,1559408677,"First of all I gotta admit that I'm a real big fan of John Woo's work and the film that got me started with him was Face/Off. After the in my opinion even more excellent M:I-2 I decided to give Woo's older works a shot and purchased the DVD of the much famed and almost legendary hard boiled.
As soon as I popped it into my DVD player, I instantly noticed one thing: video and audio quality of this DVD are the worst I've ever seen and heard!
As far as the video is concerned: dirty print, picture distortions, pixelization, color and contrast imbalances - you name it, this DVD's got it! My conclusion is that the DVD was actually made from an (old rental) laserdisc (that got involved into a plane-crash) without any sort of digital re-mastering. I might even say it rather looks digitally de-mastered. ;-)
The sound not only isn't much better, but even far worse. Listening to this DVD makes you wonder why you spent so much money for a 6 speaker sound system when some films are still presented in MONO! The answer of course becomes apparent very quickly: Mono sound on a DVD is just plain horrible.  With a film like Hard Boiled this really is a shame as it would richly profit from a good DD 5.1 or even DTS mix. The english dubbing of this film is so bad that's it's almost good again. (Which seems to be a common phenomenon with asian films.)Halfway though the film I switched over to the Cantonese version and, though (or maybe because) I didn't understand one word, almost liked it better. The reason for this is probably the fact that the entire dialogue of the film is plain DUMB. The only half intelligent lines are delivered by director John Woo himself, who (of course) has a cameo appearance.
After overcoming my shock over the horrible quality of the DVD itself, I managed to turn my attention to the actual movie. The main problem here in my opinion is its sheer length. Hard Boiled runs a solid 126 Minutes. About 90 of those minutes are a complete waste. Everything in this film that does not involve incredible stunts, pyrotechnics, double guns and explosive ammo, is just BAD.  The story is simply boring and quickly forgettable. The acting is probably as cheesy as you will ever see outside middle-school-plays. The only noteworthy exception of that is Tony Leung, whose performance quickly outplays Chow Yun Fat's trademark routine of 3 facial expressions. (blank/angry/smirky) You have to suffer through 90 minutes of almost unbearable bore (fortunately with some great action sequences inbetween)to finally enjoy the much-famed hospital-shootout-scene. (and, YES, it IS THAT GOOD!)
Why do I still give this film 3 stars? Because it has (except for the pigeons) all of your trademark John Woo stuff (slow-motion, still frames, intense and over-the-top stuntwork and choreography)that made me a fan of his work in the first place.  Still it should be noted that Hard Boiled is much more violent than all of Woo's Hollywood-films combined.
If there was an action-only (45 Minutes runtime), anamorphic, Dolby Digital version of this film available, I'd rate it 5 stars.
On a closing note: I bet any half-talented techie with a laserdisc player and a PC with videocapture-card and DVD-burner could make an equal or even better DVD in a matter of hours. So shame on Fox Lorber for this!",986688000,7,3306,4.736111111111111
181904,4,1559408677,"I saw this movie years ago.  John Woo is a master of the action movie.  His great directing was the only thing that saved Mission Impossible 2 from being a completely stupid film.  It's been a long time since I saw Hard-Boiled, but I remember that Chow Yun Fat was phenomenal; acrobatic and graceful even in the midst of heavy fight scenes.  The scene which stuck with me is quite near the end.  There's a hostage situation at a hospital which ends with a big gunfight between Chow Yun Fat and the criminals.  At one point he grabs up a little baby boy to save it from falling and gets winged by a bullet.  Some of his blood hits the baby.  He ducks away from the killers and stops to gently wipe away the blood and whisper soothing apologies for bleeding on the little guy.  It was an amazingly still moment of tenderness in the midst of the fast-paced violence of the gunfight. I was really impressed.",982108800,3,903,4.359281437125748
181905,4,1559408677,"Master of Action John Woo delivers once again with his hard-hitting, action-packed thriller ""Hard Boiled,"" starring Chow Yun-Fat as a veteran cop known as ""Tequila,"" Hong Kong's answer to San Francisco's own ""Dirty Harry.""  In this one, an undercover officer infiltrates a gangland Triad dealing arms, and when a rival gang threatens to take over, Tequila joins in the melee, and once it begins the action never stops until the last of the credits have rolled off into the recesses of the darkened screen.  Along the way there are tests of loyalty, mistaken identities and a staggering display of superbly choreographed violence.  There's a couple of plot twists, but it's a rather straightforward story, and as usual, Woo melds it with the action with his trademark style and perfection.  The action sequences are incredibly well staged and delivered, but so exceedingly violent that it passes beyond reality at times (especially during the climax) into a somewhat surreal state of being, only to be ultimately drawn back in again by the grounded core of the story.  It's a fine line that Woo treads successfully time after time in an arena in which many other ""action"" directors have foundered.  A consummate professional, Woo knows exactly what he wants and what works, and he doesn't quit until he gets it.  Among the directors of the ""action"" genre, he is quite simply the best there has ever been.  As the somewhat jaded and ""hard Boiled"" cop, the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat demonstrates that if Jackie Chan can team up with Chris Tucker, he most certainly could find a place at Eastwood or Gibson's side.  He has the attitude and the look that make his character credible, which helps anchor Woo's art in reality, albeit a rather violent one.  As with the ""Dirty Harry"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, it gives the audience someone to whom they can relate and root for.  And it's all buoyed with symbolism and metaphor and Woo's impeccable sense of timing and deft and sparing use of slow motion, which in his hands becomes an extremely effective tool.  The supporting cast includes Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Alan),Teresa Mo (Teresa Chang), Philip Chan (Superintendent Pang), Hoi-Shan Kwan (Mr. Hui) and Philip Kwok (Mad Dog).  The true brilliance of Woo's films lies in the fact that he never sacrifices story for action, but instead blends the two together to create a whole that is artistically rendered (his action sequences are something akin to visual poetry) and  substantial, rather than having an action film that-- like so many others of the genre-- is hollow inside.  Like his earlier film, ""The Killer,"" which also starred Yun-Fat, ""Hard Boiled"" pushes the envelope and will keep you on the edge, right along with the characters in the film, right until the very end.  As with all of Woo's movies, this one is a satisfying foray into the intense, cutting edge ""Action"" world of one of Cinema's Master directors, and a must-see for any true film buff.",978048000,2,2957,4.907630522088353

Hard Boiled, made in  Hong Kong, eclipses all of his American work by leaps and bounds.
The  plot is solid and the acting above average (I especially liked Tony Leung  as the undercover cop - his acting was particularly inspired), but what  make this movie such a great movie are the beautiful action sequences by  Woo and Chow Yun-Fat, who delivers a better performance than in his  American work as well.  It's been said many times, but the sequences are  absolutely poetic, and unlike M:I-2, original and inspired.

181923,4,1559408677,"""Hard Boiled"" is quite possibly the most violent action film ever.  Never have I seen such non-stop mayhem in my life.  But is this good?  Darn right!  Not only is this movie unbelievably violent, it is also  extremely entertaining.  The one trait that John Woo has that sets him  apart from all other action movie directors is the fact that he actually  makes a point to imbue his films with a solid story.  Now, this isn't epic  level story-telling by any means, but at least his films have a solid  foundation.  Compare that with 90% of the drek that comes from the Jerry  Bruckheimer school of action and you will see what I mean. This film is  quite often mentioned with it's sort-of sister film ""The Killer.""  While ""the Killer"" had a more fully developed and compeling  story, the action sequences and camera flourishes had a far more pedestrian  feel to them, which detracted from the enjoyment.  ""Hard Boiled""  is almost the mirror image.  It has a far more pedestrian script, but the  action sequences and camera movements have to be seen to be believed.  Many  directors in the US have tried (in vain) to capture Woo's style and grace  when filming brutal bloodbaths (slow-motion shots and an almost constantly  moving camera), but the result is often confused and incoherent (see  ""Bad Boys"" and ""Armageddon"").

[La Shou Shen Tan]

(Hong Kong - 1992)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

John Woo's electrifying crime-thriller amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its action set-pieces. As with virtually all of his post-1986 HK films, Woo generates a tangible sense of melancholy by placing honorable, chivalrous - even lovable - characters into situations where all those precious moral virtues are constantly being challenged and devalued by the greed and cynicism of our modern age. And yet, Woo was eventually persuaded to conclude his picture on an optimistic note, with the villains routed and the good guys allowed to resume their places in the grand scheme of things. It's a daring move, given everything which precedes it, but no less effective than the all-out tragedy which Woo had originally envisaged.",948412800,13,837,5.185185185185185

181943,5,1559408677,"I've already reviewed the film elsewhere so this applies strictly to this Criterion DVD edition.
Wonderful packaging, great bonus material.  The inclusion of the dubbed English version (which I've argued actually  surpasses the somewhat stiff original script) was a great idea, and the  extra material is stunning:  An essay on Hong Kong crime cinema; a library  of John Woo trailers that's simply breathtaking, showcasing Woo's  miraculous sense of monumental shot designs; a student film which, though  not as compact or amusing as, say, Martin Scorsese's ""The Big  Shave"", is still indicative of Woo's development and shows a real  sense of black humour and imagery; good commentary tracks by Woo himself  and Terence Chang (inspired choice).  Roger Avary is the only shaky element  here, his comments lacking in economy and eloquence, but merely a small  dent in a top-notch package.  Also, it's wonderful to hear Woo comment on  Philip Kwok, the unbelievably graceful, physically impressive  actor/stuntman who shines as Mad Dog in the film.
Criterion wins my  trust, making a very good film (Hard Boiled isn't one of my favourites  among Woo's oeuvre) great, and giving due attention to the fact that, as  with most of Woo's films, Hard Boiled functions both as expressive,  formalistic art and simply a thrilling action movie.",947548800,4,1333,5.2274881516587675

Frankly, aside from perhaps a couple Jackie Chan films like  ""Police Story"", I don't think any other film coming from Hong  Kong has influenced American action films so much.

Overlength is Hard Boiled's chief weakness.  After  spending over an hour in that hospital with flames all around and  innumberable men in suits getting shot, it starts to get tiring.  Chow  Yun-fat is impeccable in the lead and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is excellent,  though versatile actress Teresa Mo is wasted in a skin-deep supporting  role.
The biggest thing to commend on this video release, however, is the  dubbing.  I speak both Cantonese and English, personally, and I can tell  American viewers that the dubbed script is even better than the original,  which sounded stilted (Philip Chan Yan-kin's lines were especially forced  in the original).  The dubbed voices were acting, not just translating (as  in dubbed Jackie Chan movies such as the U.S. release Operation Condor, for  example).
