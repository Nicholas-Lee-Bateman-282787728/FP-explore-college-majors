1387478,4,B000051VS3,"This is an enjoyable, straightforward performance of the Nutcracker Ballet, which I'd rate very good overall in terms of dancing, music and video composition.  It is important to point out that this version, choreographed by Vasily Vainonen (libretto by Petipa), follows a slightly different storyline that the most common version.  In this performance, the Sugar Plum Fairy is absent, and the role of Drosselmeyer (Piotr Russanov) is far more prominent.  I won't quibble with which interpretation of the ballet is better than which other one; the story is intact and very recognizable, and a different twist here or there shouldn't keep anyone from enjoying this.

On the positive side, the amazingly clear and bright orchestral music (played before a live audience) was superb, to the point of actually being moving.  I'd be pleased with this as a CD.  The Kirov dancers all performed admirably, and the lack of any major standout in the cast didn't detract.  The pas de deux with Masha (Larissa Lezhnina) and the Prince (Victor Baranov) was very well done.  A welcome surprise was the Dance of the Mirlitons, performed by three young and impressively skilled students of the Vaganova Dance School.

On the downside, there were a few instances of image framing that cut the dancers off at the knees, which I consider a faux pas because ballet videography should make every effort to capture a dancer's entire form.  The result was some missed footwork.  The only glaring annoyance arose during the pas de deux (the highlight, it figures), which was marred by the waving silhouettes of the conductor's hands intruding into the field of view.  Unfortunate.  Also, the DVD menu is without a chapter selection mode, so that a reference back to the liner notes must be made in order to jump to a specific scene.

All things considered, the few negatives are far outweighed by a fine show.  This Nutcracker is likely to please most everyone.",1131667200,30,1937,4.972049689440993
1387479,4,B000051VS3,"Every time I play this DVD the orchestra seems to play better than the previous time. The winds are just amazing. On the other hand, the choreography, by Vasily Vainonen, is excellent, and Lezhnina and Baranov are superb in the main roles.
The only drawback of this DVD is its ""below average"" picture quality, which may be somewhat improved by watching it in ""cinema mode"" (if bright colors are enhanced, then the figures acquire a ghost or shadow). But the quality of the performance more than makes up for this drawback. Recommended.",1088812800,10,535,4.826086956521739
1387480,3,B000051VS3,"I have been trying to find a suitable production of ""The Nutcracker"" ballet to entertain my  (adult) children when we gather here at our home for the holiday season. The word tradition has crossed my mind. I have a very good home theatre set up. Upon viewing the Kirov version of this ballet, I was both pleased anddisappointed. The sound was okay  and the picture quality was so so. What shocked me was the blatent emission of several key scenes from this production. The ""growing"" Christmas tree, The woman who hid all those children under her extra large dress and the ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" episode were very annoying. While the two featured artists were quite talented, I think, given all the talent of the Kirov, other dancers should have been featured in more scenes.",995673600,14,770,4.7388059701492535
1387481,5,B000051VS3,"My granddaughter absolutely loves it. We also have a copy. In my opinion this is the best version I have ever seen. The set decoration, costumes and scenery is breath taking. A really enjoyable piece of entertainment.",1392768000,,217,4.891891891891892
1387482,5,B000051VS3,"This is my favorite Nutcracker. It has been loved in our house for many years now. When we switched to DVD, we tried to transfer the old tape, but it had blue-out areas and crackling because of age. This DVD comes with a lovely, glossy color booklet and retains all the detail of the original on TV. This version leaves out the corny food elements of the Nutcracker, including the Sugar Plum Fairy. Clara is played throughout by adult dancer Larissa Lezhnina, instead of by a little girl. The result is an enchanting light romantic fantasy, performed in splendid pastel costumes against pretty sets. The setting is vaguely very late 18th century. Highly recommended for families seeking a polished, sophisticated, yet wholesome Nutcracker.",1356739200,2,739,5.016260162601626
1387483,4,B000051VS3,"The content of the DVD was amazing, but the only flaw was that I could not play it on my computer which has DVD playing capability (Sound was coming out but had static-ish display). Could only play from a DVD player connected to TV.",1297641600,2,232,4.295454545454546
1387484,5,B000051VS3,Great video of a beautiful traditional Nutcracker.  I will enjoy watching it over and over again during the next few months right up to Christmas.,1244764800,2,146,4.84
1387485,5,B000051VS3,"There are folks in my town who have no idea what ""The Nutcracker"" is all about, nor do they know that there is even a ballet called ""The Nutcracker"". For that matter, some do not know what a ballet is. The largest metropolis, Atlanta, Ga., is a two and one half hour drive from where I live. So, it isn't too surprising to hear the word ""No"" when asking, ""have you ever seen The Nutcracker""? You probably know something about the story, since you are reading this review, but may not know about THIS version. A few things you WON'T find in this version: 1) A beautiful green Christmas tree in the Stahlbaum parlor. Instead there is a modernistic paper caricature of a tree, which later turns into a green tree and grows dimensionally. 2) Boys aggravating the girls. They are played by all girls. 3) A handsome wooden Nutcracker. Instead it is a quite ugly rag-doll. 4) Boy solders fighting the mice. They are all girls. It's OK, I love girls. 5) Computer animation. 6) Mother Gigogne and her Little Clowns 7) The Sugar-Plum Fairy. But, Masha (beautiful Larissa Lezhnina) dances her variation to the music ""The Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy"", so you are not going to miss that beautiful music, played on the celesta. An instrument heard by the public for the first time in the ""Nutcracker Suite"", before the ballet was ever performed on stage. The ballet was so long in rehearsal that Tchaikovsky was afraid someone else would get wind of the new instrument (celesta) and introduce it to the public before he did. So, he arranged a suite of the best tunes from his score, and they were performed before the ballet.

Something you WILL find in this version is the Dance of The Mirlitons (sometimes called Dance of the Reed Pipes) by three very remarkable, and adorable, children from the Vaganova (Va-GONE-ova) Dance Academy (where Balanchine, Nureyev, and Baryshnikov got their early training). Some reviewers are complaining about the tempo of the music in this ""Nutcracker"". The ""children"" mentioned above, would naturally need a slower tempo to match their experience. I'm sure Mr. Fedotov, the conductor, is experienced enough to know how to pace an orchestra for the particular dancers on the stage. The names of the children are, Tatiana Miltseva, Elena Chmil, and Artem Pykhachev. They are also featured on another DVD by the Kirov Ballet, ""Essential Ballet"", which can be found in the three ballet set by the Kirov Ballet entitled ""The magic of Russian Ballet"" (which also includes this Nutcracker, and Firebird, Petrushka, and Scheherazade).......<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-of-Russian-Ballet-The-Nutcracker-Return-of-the-Firebird-Petrushka-Scheherazade-Essential-Ballet-Kirov-Ballet/dp/B00061RZQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic of Russian Ballet / The Nutcracker, Return of the Firebird, Petrushka, Scheherazade, Essential Ballet, Kirov Ballet</a>........Each ballet is available separately including Essential Ballet. Oh, and one other thing you will get, is a nice booklet where I got some of this information.

The sets and costumes are sumptuous but on the pink side of pink. Whoever did the sets and lighting AND costumes loved pink. It's everywhere. Even the DVD keepcase is pink. This is a live production from the famous Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. Excellent sound quality, and audience participation. I believe you will like this example of classical ballet.

One other thing I would like to advise you of, DON'T believe everything you read in these reviews. Remember, these are personal (debatable) opinions, including this one. I do hope you learn something from this review, and that you find it useful...........Richard....email me.",1231200000,6,3721,5.368150684931507
1387486,3,B000051VS3,"The sets are gorgeous, music and sound is fantastic, the costumes are very well done overall, although I agree with the other criticism of the Nutcracker looking ugly and not like a nutcracker at all.  True, the children were all played by adults, and the boys were played by girls, it was a little distracting, but not a huge problem for me.  You can see the orchestra director's hands waving around sometimes, but it made me smile and reminded me that - after all - it was performed live.
My problem was that so much of the dancing seemed to drag, as though they struggled or had no power behind the movements.  The main performances were fine enough, but not very moving.  There was little emotion from the dancers' faces to pull me in or make me feel, and they generally seemed lethargic, although it was probably due more to the choreography, than the dancers' abilities.
I would not recommend this version, and if I had watched it first, I would not have bought it.  I prefer the dancing from the super-70's version with Baryshikov to this.

Overall, gorgeous sets, lovely costumes generally, wonderful orchestra and sound with live audience.
But strange lighting issues that were dim and pinkish was distracting, the dancing lacked power and emotion for me.",1198627200,2,1264,4.748858447488584
1387487,5,B000051VS3,"My 2 year old daughter loves this DVD!!  She puts on the Nutcracker anytime that she thinks of it and dances, marches, and twirls!  Great entertainment for both parents and kids!  I watch her instead of the DVD.  Even better when she wants to put on her leotard, tights, and ballet skirt!",1168992000,4,288,4.480769230769231
1387488,3,B000051VS3,"I read all the reviews for this DVD, and chose it based on that; I had decided not to go for the ""star"" power of some of the others, and this one sounded good. I was disappointed however, that the nutcracker doll did not look like a soldier, it was very ugly, and looked like some kind of chinaman laborer, with a que!  What!?  Also, the boys were all played by girls in the party scene, somewhat distracting, and why is the main character called Masha, instead of Clara? Also, the Christmas tree was white, and then in the dream it was green, and you didn't see it grow.  All these things bothered me, but the dancing and sets, and most of the costumes were good. A couple of things other people mentioned that bothered them, I either didn't notice, or didn't detract from my enjoyment as much as the other things.  I didn't notice if someone's feet were cut out of the frame, and the conductor's hands in the bottom of the frame, only reminded me that there was a live orchestra there, which is, after all, part of the performance. I kind of liked it.",1167177600,8,1053,4.32994923857868
1387489,5,B000051VS3,"I regard this version the best by far of all Nutcrackers. It makes clear that the ballet is about a young girl's awakening to sex. The phallic Christmas tree that enlarges and rises, the battle with the ""dirty"" mice who represent her fears of sexuality, and the overcoming of them via the love of a faithful prince who helps her to conquer them and send them fleeing, are all spot on. Most versions don't get or convey the sexual meaning of the ballet, but rather turn it into a anodine children's story with toys. Lezhina is marvelous, so sure in every movement, and with such energy. The way she bounds across the stage in the love duet and jumps into Baranov's arms is bravura ballet at its best. The whole thing is near perfect. Just---one is sure---as Tchaikovsy intended it.",1166918400,7,780,4.578571428571428
1387490,4,B000051VS3,"This production of Tchaikovsky's evergreen ballet ""Nutcracker"" is very fine, but I have some reservations about the camera work.  This is a wide screen production, and having a small (13 inch) television makes it difficult to watch, as many shots are taken from a distance to see the dancers on stage interacting with each other, and in a counterpoint to one another - the architecture as a whole.  I suppose the answer would be to buy a larger TV set, but this is hardly cost effective to playback of one DVD...

That said, the Kirov orchestra plays very well under conductor Fedotov, and the precision of the dancers is very engaging, especially in Act 1.  I was impressed and intrigued with the dancing of Herr Drosselmeyer.  The ""Dance of the Snowflakes"" and ""Waltz of the Flowers"" are beautiful and very moving. However, in Act 2, tempos seem really slow, especially in the ""Dance des Mirlitons"" and the omission of ""Mere Gigone and the Clowns "" (The old woman who lived in a shoe) seems curious to me:  it's one of my favorite pieces from ""Nutcracker"" and I was disappointed not to see/hear it in this production.

Still, the sound is top notch digital, warm and enveloping, and it would sound terrific on Surround Sound systems. There is much to enjoy here, and I recommend this DVD with a few reservations.",1133136000,9,1314,4.6869565217391305

7929461,4,B000051VS3,"We really enjoy this version, especially the children doing the slowed down Mirliton dance. They are superb! I don't understand some reviewer's remarks about the absence of the Sugarplum Fairy, she is there, but it is not a separate person from the main dancer girl. My only regret is this version does not contain the Mother Ginger dance, which is one of the ones we are trying to learn.",1481500800,,388,4.63768115942029

7929464,5,B000051VS3,"I'll leave the discussions of the story and the dances to those more knowledgeable, and point out a few other things that delighted me. For a start, I was reminded of Kay Thompson's ""Think Pink"" number from FUNNY FACE. My GOD, but there's a whole lotta pink here. Check out the cover of the DVD to get some idea of that. Even gayer is Act One. All the Boys in The Background have quite the little sub-plot going. Follow the guy in the dark pink coat with the white piping, as he gossips, flirts, whispers and changes partners. Someone spent a lot of time making sure that everyone had a character and a back story. Grab this baby up and have fun. It's a joy on so many levels.",1451088000,,676,4.248062015503876
7929465,3,B000051VS3,"This is a rather muted, old-fashioned  version of Tchaikovsky's well-loved ballet, filmed in 1993 at St. Petersburg's Marinsky Theatre where it had its premiere over a century ago.  Many of the sets were stunning, but it was obvious the costumes had been around for a few decades.  One of the male dancers in the Waltz of the Flowers had an obvious split up the back of his weskit.  The predominant color was pink.

Vasily Vainonen's 1934 choreography and libretto eliminate the Sugar Plum Fairy and her consort (not too unusual, nowadays).  Larissa Lezhnina (who spent most of her career with the Dutch National Ballet) dances the role of Masha and also takes over the music that would have been allotted to the Sugar Plum Fairy.  Her Nutcracker Prince is Victor Baranov.  Masha's godfather, the mysterious Herr Drosselmeyer is danced by Piotr Russanov.  The Kirov Ballet Company performs the supporting roles.

High point:  The Prince's ethereal pas de deux with Masha after he loses his really ugly Nutcracker mask.

Low point: The Persian dance was performed by women with long braids, waving scarves and doing little else for over five minutes.  A totally unsexy performance, in spite of the suggestive music.  If you want to experience a really great Persian dance, try Valery Gergiev's ""Nutcracker"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-The-Nutcracker-Complete-Ballet/dp/B00000A1GL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker - Complete Ballet</a>) which was also performed at St. Petersburg's Marinsky Theatre.

Total run time of this Nutcracker is a brisk 104 minutes.",1450483200,3,1633,5.662551440329218
7929466,4,B000051VS3,"This production of the Nutcracker ballet has become the ultimate version and unbeatable for me.  I find the choreography and the performances perfect.  It also has the best non-intrusive camera work of all the other videos I have seen.  Alas, the only problem is the very poor picture quality.

Larissa Lezhninas performance is a perfect demonstration of the art of ballet.  Both she and Viktor Baranov dance with strength and fluidity as if gliding through the stage. All other dancers are equally graceful and in perfect command of their movements. The choreography is the best I have seen and I think the dances follows the traditional theme of the Nutcracker better than other productions. All and all this version remains constantly artful and appeasing to both grown ups and children without getting silly and comical.

For years, I have been searching for the definitive Nutcracker ballet to include in my Christmas celebrations.  Of all the videos of this ballet I have seen, on DVDs and blu-ray, none has been as enjoyable as this performance.  I wish someone would re-master this recording and give it the video quality it deserves.",1449878400,2,1142,5.005291005291006

7929468,4,B000051VS3,"In this 1994 DVD, Viktor Fedotov conducts the Kirov Ballet in a live performance of the traditional Russian version of The Nutcracker, featuring Larissa Lezhnina, Viktor Baranov, and the Kirov's renowned corps de ballet. Despite shortcomings in video quality, and despite the need to explain what the Russian Nutcracker is and is not, this is among the best productions available to home viewers.

Obviously, the 20-year-old video is not as sharp as today's Blu-rays. Plus, some DVD players and TV sets might have trouble accommodating the 1.85:1 aspect ratio (the product page identifies the aspect ratio as 1.33:1, but the DVD says 1.85:1). Aside from these drawbacks, some primitive, hokey computer graphics are employed in the journey to the Land of Sweets. Such were the limits of the era.

So, then, what is a traditional Russian Nutcracker? First, we need to look at the original libretto Tchaikovsky set to music for ballet master Marius Petipa's 1892 staging of The Nutcracker, which nobody nowadays seems to follow.

In it, the Stahlbaum family is hosting a Christmas Eve party, at which their daughter Masha (the Russian diminutive of Maria) is given a nutcracker doll by her godfather Drosselmeyer, a toymaker and magician. After bedtime, Masha sneaks downstairs to check on the doll. The clock strikes midnight, Drosselmeyer appears, threatening mice come out of the woodwork, the tree grows to enormous heights as the Mouse King emerges in his evil glory, and the nutcracker -- grown to life size -- leads his soldiers into the fight.

To help protect her endangered nutcracker, Masha throws her shoe at the Mouse King, distracting him and enabling the nutcracker to stab the wicked ruler and force his minions to retreat. Then the nutcracker is transformed into a handsome prince, who leads Masha through a forest of snowflakes before transporting her to his kingdom, the Land of Sweets, where the Sugar Plum Fairy and her cavalier have been ruling in the prince's absence.

In Masha's honor, a worldwide celebration of sweets ensues, the Sugar Plum Fairy and her cavalier dance, a final waltz is performed by all the sweets, and Masha and the prince are crowned rulers of the kingdom. The ballet's closing apotheosis, as one translation of the libretto says, ""represents a large beehive with flying bees, closely guarding their riches."" The end. Masha doesn't go back home, but stays in her new kingdom.

In a 1919 revival of The Nutcracker, Russian choreographer Alexander Gorsky (the same choreographer who inserted the jester into Swan Lake) came up with the idea of turning the fantasy scenes of Act II into a dream from which Masha awakens and returns home, instead of making the Land of Sweets her final destination. Gorsky also eliminated the Sugar Plum Fairy and her cavalier and gave their dances to Masha and the Nutcracker Prince, who were played by adults instead of children -- thus introducing a romantic element not part of the 1892 original.

In 1934, Vasily Vainonen, who set out the choreography for the Waltz of the Snowflakes and the Waltz of the Flowers, included a puppet show staged by Drosselmeyer during the Christmas Party. The puppet show foreshadows the later fantasy scenes by having a prince, a princess, and a Mouse King as characters.

Thus the ""traditional"" Russian Nutcracker came to be. And it is this version that Fedotov and the Kirov present almost flawlessly.

The dancing is superior throughout. The rising of the Mouse King from what appears to be the depths of Hades is impressively frightful, as is the battle that ensues. The Waltz of the Snowflakes is delightful. The Waltz of the Flowers, with its delicate pastel coloring and stately tempo, is the highlight it should be and becomes more impressive with each viewing. Also charming is the Dance of the Mirlitons, performed by three Vaganova Dance School students.

If Lezhnina is too clearly a grown woman to be entirely convincing as the young girl of Act I, she compensates with strong acting abilities (even if she might have benefited from more practice at accurately throwing a pointe shoe). In Act II, the Sugar Plum Fairy's absence isn't detrimental because Lezhnina's performance fills the void. Her execution of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy is as good as you'll see anyone do it.

To compensate for the less-than-stellar video quality, the orchestral sound is clear and rich and full and merits special mention, rounding out an altogether praiseworthy performance whose significant shortcomings involve technical issues of DVD manufacture. I'd still like to see a performance that sticks to the original libretto, but the Kirov's Nutcracker remains a winner.",1411344000,5,4685,5.055699481865285
7929469,5,B000051VS3,I bought this as a gift for a friend who is a ballet enthusiast.  She enjoyed it very much.  It's a lush and romantic production.,1393372800,2,129,4.12
