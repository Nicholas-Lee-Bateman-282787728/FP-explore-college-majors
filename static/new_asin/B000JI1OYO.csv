The program includes:

* Close 4-part Harmony

A group of favorite radio songs included an old favorite ""Give the World a Smile,"" and ""Boundless Love.""  ""The Laughing Song,"" ""Oh Happy Day,"" and Moving Up To Gloryland"" added some lighthearted fun to the concert.

Special family segments featured Glen Payne being honored for 50 years of faithful music ministry with testimonies from his family. George Younce,his wife Clara and members of his family were interviewed in their home.
My favorite selections include:

* Thanks to Calvary
