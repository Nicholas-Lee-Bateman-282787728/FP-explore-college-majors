I was a little girl, and tagged along.  I got to meet Lucy briefly!  Everyone on the shoot seemed to be having so much fun, and it spills over into the viewing experience.  Fernando Lamas is dazzing, Satchmo is cute, and Lucy and Desi are their usual selves.  If you like Lucy, you will LOVE this TV special!",1312588800,3,463,4.4
7854853,4,6303912664,"""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" was, in essence, an hour-long version of ""I Love Lucy"". There were 13 of these ""jumbo"", one-hour Lucy episodes produced over a three-year period (1957 to 1960), with the episode on this VHS videotape being one of the funnier entries, in this writer's opinion.

""Lucy Goes To Sun Valley"" was the 5th episode in the ""Lucy-Desi"" series, originally being broadcast on network TV on April 14, 1958. It co-stars actor Fernando Lamas (as himself), who just happens to bump into Lucy and the gang at a ski resort in Sun Valley, Idaho.

Lamas is given a very funny role here, simply playing himself in some humorous situations created by that wacky redhead named Lucy.

There is one particularly-hilarious moment in the script, where Lamas and Ricky (Desi Arnaz) are having a discussion about Lucy, and neither man can seem to pronounce the word ""jealous"" with any great deal of proficiency. LOL!

This VHS video comes via CBS/FOX Home Video, and runs for about 51 minutes. Audio is a re-mixed Hi-Fi 2-Channel Stereo. English Captions are also included. The packaging also has some nice artwork, with some original publicity still photos displayed on the box.

Watch Lucy drive Fernando Lamas crazy in this home-video version of ""Lucy Goes To Sun Valley"", from the short-lived ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"".",1099612800,,1320,4.9818181818181815
7854854,5,6303912664,"I recommend this one, if you like the snow, romance, comedy, and a handsome movie star.  Reminds you of your first skiing lesson, this will bring back memories. A beautiful setting, skiing in Sun Valley, log cabin, fireplace, ski lifts, mountains, it has it all. Lucy has a handsome movie star for a private instructor,and Ricky gets jealous. You'll end up laughing.",977097600,5,366,4.903225806451613
