7944775,4,B00005M2EQ,"i totally understand when others have reviewed this dvd and commented on the sound, editing, etc but i got this for 4.00 and there is a charm to those old 80's Xmas specials like this and the osmonds, captain n tennille, etc that bring me back to that time growing up and if you don't look to hard its very easy to lose yourself in the music and scenery and the its so bad its good jokes/writing. all n all for 4.00 there are more than enough moments to warm your heart through song and of course, to see crystal back when she was in her highpoint of her career is fun!  for the low price get it and pop it in every xmas comes around to view once and its a nice reminder of the holidays :)",1354924800,2,689,3.9927536231884058
7944776,5,B00005M2EQ,"Crystal Gayles ""shines"" in this Christmas special filmed in Sweden. She sounds beautiful singing several Christmas Carols with help from her guest stars John Davidson and David Hasselhoff. The special really fills you with the Christmas spirit!",1230768000,3,244,5.621621621621622
7944777,4,B00005M2EQ,"I'm stumped by the bad reviews people have been posting on this DVD.  It is what it is - Crystal's 1987 CBS Christmas special filmed in Sweden.  She is beautiful as always of course and sings heavenly, what more could you want.  Well, I agree she is saddled with some not particularly talented guest stars, although David Hasselhoff seems like a likable California version of a good ole boy and he certainly was a good-looking hunk of man in his thirties.  He may not be the world's greatest singer, foreign record sales to the contrary, but he works well with Crystal.  It's kind of nice to see an old Christmas show on DVD in a fine print, this was likely one of the last ""old fashioned"" Christmas variety programs before they got hip and trendy and as false as a fake Christmas tree.",1134864000,16,786,4.468531468531468
7944778,2,B00005M2EQ,I've been a Crystal Gayle fan since I saw her in concert in San Diego many years ago and feel some of the songs she sang in this DVD were good.  The part where John Davidson sings to the kids outside the homes should have been cut.  I would have liked to hear more songs sung by Crystal Gayle.  It was hard to get into a flowing Christmas feeling.,1126828800,,347,4.0
