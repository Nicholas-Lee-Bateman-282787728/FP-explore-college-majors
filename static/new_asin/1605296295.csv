7800289,5,1605296295,"I Love these videos!  I've used these videos for 3 years but recently lost my videos in a move to a new home.  So I ordered some more.  This is a series of 20 minute videos that give you a good workout.  The routines are easy and repetitive so you can focus on doing the moves correctly - for maximum benefit.  I'm not terribly coordinated due to a neurological condition so I like the simplicity of the moves, unlike some videos that have complicated dance routines.  You may add small handheld weights for added intensity.  Chris and her team are great motivators which keeps you pushing on.  I am 60 years old and love these videos.  They will work for all ages because you can add handheld weights and step up your pace for a more intense workout.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prevention-2-Week-Turnaround-Strength/dp/1605296295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prevention: 2-Week Turnaround, Strength</a>",1476403200,2,949,5.534722222222222

7800293,5,1605296295,"I did the full workout today, both routines, and really enjoyed them. I used to be an advanced+ exerciser, using mostly Cathe Friedrich but with injuries, surgeries, babies, and a shift in priorities and likes/dislikes, I'm at a beginner level again. Unlike other reviews on amazon for this workouts, I am not someone that has been working out consistently for a good chunk of time unless of course you consider gardening and toddler-detail. I think for those in my position, this is an excellent DVD. I've had it in my collection for yrs but just today, finally took of the shrink wrap. I've been wanting to get back into strength workouts but I cannot for the life of me bring myself to actually use Cathe's workouts again, although I know they bring results. I want something that doesn't drive me into the ground and still leaves me with something left to give afterwards- I've got babies and a life, I no longer need nor want to be blasted after I workout. No thanks. Those days of interest are long gone. This workout fits the bill!

You'll get two 15 minute workouts. The first alternates Upper and Lower body exercises. They are sequenced in such a way that your heart rate stays elevated and thus, you cannot lift to your ""max"" like you would with gym style strength workouts. You'll get a balance challenge and if you follow the instructions about form and posture, you'll get not only a great stabilizer workout, but also a good core workout as well. The second 15 Minute workout is a Total Body w/Core routine. Like the first you do all of your standing them hit the floor for the last few minutes. More balance challenge here while keeping the heart rate up. I did have to modify the front lunges (Front lunges with shoulder presses) and do rear lunges bc I have knee issues and past surgeries; that exercise has always put too much stress on my knee joints. Other than that, even will all of my old injuries, I could do the workout as designed following either the beginner or ""make it harder"" option. I found that at time I needed those beginner option and other times I could do the challenge move.

Are you going to be featured on the cover of a fitness magazine doing this workout? No. Will it help you to build some muscle and shake things up all while progressing you at your pace? Yes! You can always increase your weights for more of a challenge as needed. If you are like me and not interested in doing the ""puke in the bucket"" workouts or if you're not interested in spending hours a day doing strenuous workouts, then please, purchase this one!",1450051200,4,2569,4.5344827586206895
7800294,4,1605296295,"This is a pretty good 30 minute total body strength workout...I wish it would've been a little longer, but all in all, it's a good workout when you don't have more than half an hour to work out. I really enjoyed the ""make it harder"" options which usually included balance/core work with each strength move. I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, and this DVD was challenging but not too hard at all. All the moves are basic and easy to follow, and the Instructor (Chris Freytag) is great at cuing. The reason I gave this 4 stars is b/c usually Chris gives a solid warm-up, but I found the warm-up on this DVD seriously lacking...I paused the dvd and gave myself a few more minutes of dynamic stretching to loosen up my muscles.",1341964800,5,733,4.518796992481203
7800295,5,1605296295,I just tried this DVD for the first time today and can say this will be one of my favorites.  I love the cues Chris gives and she moves much slower in this workout program than any other I've seen her perform.  I don't feel like I'm falling all over my feet trying to keep up with her as is the case with many of the other DVD's from her that I've used. She has two other girls in this video with her and one does a modified version which I appreciate.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a good but not overtaxing strength training workout.,1310342400,6,560,4.072727272727272
7800296,5,1605296295,"I really like this DVD, Chris is easy to follow and you work up a sweat. I usually just use Leslie Sansone walk DVDs which I really like, but I don't feel the pain like I do with this DVD. I alternate the Prevention Strength & Cardio and stick in a walk DVD a couple times a week and really feel I get a good workout.",1309392000,5,317,3.8181818181818183
