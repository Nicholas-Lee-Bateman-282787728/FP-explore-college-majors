8091889,4,B000BSZAJC,The X Division title match between Mikey Batts & Roderick Strong was a good hot back-and-forth opener. The Erick Stevens-Mikey Tenderfoot match was a nice short filler. The Florida tag team title match between Double Deuce & 911 Inc. was so-so and the finish came literally out of nowhere. The Florida Southern title match between Lex Lovett & Raven was a good spot brawl with a hot finish to boot. The Steve Madison-Vordell Walker match was a solid old school bout. The Florida Heavyweight title match between Bruce Steel & Jerry Lawler was a bad bout with a dumb DQ ending to boot. I give this event a 7 out of 10.,1358121600,,616,4.508928571428571
8091890,5,B000BSZAJC,"I'm fascinated by Quebec because they share our North American culture yet speak a different language, French. I've been studying French for a long time. This film is an excellent example of how the Qubcois relate to the United States. When the Canadians get sick of winter they escape to Florida for a few months. Some areas of Florida have even been nicknamed ""Floribec"" because a French community has formed to support the ""snowbird"" migration.

I also liked this film because it features a shabby motel which the family from Quebec renovates as their new business. I have lived next to a motel all my life so it seems like a quintessential aspect of life in America. A great deal of the film's plot concerns the motel business and how it is run.

Finally, I liked this movie because it reminds me of the 1980s comedies. ""La Florida"" is like an unknown 80s movie filtered through a slightly different culture. However the humor is classic 80s, just like any of the comedy hit films of that era.",1338595200,4,997,4.627118644067797
