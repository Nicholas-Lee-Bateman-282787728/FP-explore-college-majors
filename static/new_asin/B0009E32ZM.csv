8059320,5,B0009E32ZM,"Coach Mitaka is smooth, athletic, has a nice car, teaches tennis, has a smile that reflects light, and is a rival for Godai.  During this series, you see Godai investigate Kyoko's late husband, Kyoko getting drunk, and Kyoko's parents intervening to get her to quit.  Further, Mr. Yotsuya, whose occupation is unknown, has an episode devoted to who he is.  The Maison Ikkoku crew try to figure out this mysterious character's very existence.  Of course, whether or not Godai gets to go to college or must remain a ronin is also determined this season, but how important is that in comparison to Kyoko's love or Mr. Yotsuya's identity?

If you liked the first three seasons, you will love this one as well.  My advice is to watch it with subtitles, not the English version.",1355702400,,772,4.723880597014926
8059321,4,B0009E32ZM,"I appreciate Viz releasing the series, since it's unlikely to be a big seller for them (despite how good it is), but I wish they'd have taken the time to redo the transfer of the first few episodes in this series.  Clearly there was too much edge enhancement applied in the mastering and the quality suffers badly with blocking and breakup.  Fortunately it clears up by the end of the first disc and the rest are fine.

The subtitles are well translated, accurate and vigorous.  The voice acting, however, is ghastly and suffers from appalling miscasting.

However, it's still a wonderful soap opera anime, a very good adaptation of the fabulous manga, and if you don't fall in love with the characters, you have no heart!

Highly recommended.",1120780800,7,743,4.765625
