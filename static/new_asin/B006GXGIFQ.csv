8497939,5,B006GXGIFQ,"This movie is based on a book written by Mikhail Sholokhov in the early Stalin era (1928 - 1932) before forced collectivization and the purges.  The Russian title is Quiet Don but it is usually translated into English as Quiet Flows the Don or And Quiet Flows the Don.  But there is nothing quiet about this story which involves a tumultuous romance, war, and revolution.  There is remarkably very political propaganda in this movie except for a couple of small segments.

To understand who the Cossacks were you need to know Russia is divided into four east-west climate zones. The northernmost is the tundra which is basically uninhabitable. Russians have historically lived in the next two zones which are forest and forest-plain.  The southernmost is the steppes, a treeless plain stretching from Asia through Russia to Ukraine.  The steppes were settled by various groups of militaristic Asia nomads.  The Russians eventually conquered this area in the 18th century.

The Cossacks were escaped serfs who established self-governing farming communities at the edge of the steppes.  They were thus a frontier people and highly militarized.  This happened about 300 years from the time of the movie and about 400 years from today.  The Cossacks historically acted as mercenaries for whatever government happened to be in Moscow.  But they considered themselves to be a separate group, just like Scots in the British army.

The story here covers the Cossacks just before World War I, the war itself, the Communist Revolution, and the resulting Civil War.  The first part covers a romantic relationship between one Cossack and the wife of another Cossack.  Then the movie switches to the revolution and the various wars.  It shows the Cossacks divided at the time of the revolution between pro-Soviet and anti-Soviet segments.  This is where the propaganda comes in with the movie emphasizing that certain Cossacks realized Communism would give them freedom, equality, and land.  Of course we now know that Stalin forced all farmers including Cossacks into government collective farms and basically made them serfs again.

But the movie suddenly switches to show that the majority White Cossacks defeated the Red Cossacks and established an independent Don Republic in 1918.  Here it becomes apparent that this is the Russian version of Gone With the Wind.  The whole movie basically shows the side of the losers and the main Cossack is the Russian Rhett Butler.  Eventually the regular Red Army invades the Don Republic in 1920 and conquers it.

Modern technology eventually made the Cossacks obsolete and today their main role is as ceremonial regiments in military parades, just like the Minutemen in America.  The movie is well made with great scenes of the steppes and Cossack life.  It is very long for modern audiences at about five hours but worth the effort..",1515628800,,2867,5.100858369098712
8497940,5,B006GXGIFQ,the book is a fine novel.  the copy I received was falling apart.  The description said good condition.  the book was in tatters,1474329600,,128,4.478260869565218
8497941,3,B006GXGIFQ,"I have noting but praise for the seller of this item - they were wonderful - but alas, this movie was not so good... Visually striking, but the dialogue - Oy! Too cumbersome and poor dubbing, corny writing. Oh well, I did manage to watch the whole thing. But it was painful...",1374451200,2,276,4.326923076923077
8497942,5,B006GXGIFQ,"The acting and photography are excellent.  It is a long film so western viewers used to ""short"" 90 to 100 minute films may not have the patience to view it. The movie would have been even better if some of the sound track was based on Don Cossack genre music.  However, there are some scenes e.g. wedding when there is some folk music, dancing and singing that adds to the atmosphere.  The scenery and settings were well done.  Having spent some time recently on the Don River, filming on location adds much to the authenticity. The uniforms and most weapons appear to be of the period.  One exception (and I may be wrong): the Austrian machine-guns appear to be ""modern"" or at best WWII period.  It is a modern tragic story (compared to Elizabethan period Romeo & Juliet) of ""star-crossed"" lovers complete with ""modern"" infidelity set against the complex historical period of the Russian Revolution.  (What is probably not generally known is that the Don Cossacks declared an independent Don Republic when Nicholas II abdicated.  This republic lasted only 3 years until the Bolsheviks under Lenin's orders initiated what would now be termed ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Don region.)  The film also shows a people outside the typical western ""Cossack"" stereotype.  (Although citizens of Russia, generally Cossacks do not consider themselves ""Russian"" any more than a Scot would consider himself ""English"" although Scotland is part of Great Britain.)

It is amazing that Sholohov was able to publish the book during the Stalin era without having the main character become a ""dedicated communist"".  One thing that would have added to the disc is background on the novel.  This was done to the recent re-issue of the Soviet version, i.e. short biography of Sholohov including video clips.",1356912000,4,1782,5.0
8497943,2,B006GXGIFQ,"This is one of those films that is a European collaboration, though written and directed by Sergey Bondarchuk (They Fought For The Motherland etc) and adapted from the Nobel award winning book by novelist Mikhail Sholokov. The novel is a tale of sprawling, epic proportions that takes us on a Doctor Zhivago type adventure; this though unlike David Leans classic, limps from one sullen scene to the next, with more gaffs than you can shake a stick at.

It stars Rupert Everett as Grigory a Cossack's son who has an eye for the ladies especially married Aksinia. His infidelities are brought to light and his limping father arranges for him to marry a god fearing daughter of one of the clan. Meantime everyone has to do military service and as luck would have it the First World War breaks out giving an excuse for what started off being quite a good battle scene. But the errors pile up with the wrong type of guns, badly placed make up and blood that looks like Supermarket Own Brand Tomato Ketchup.

We have some more of Grigory's love trysts and Everett's acting is so painfully dull that I was amazed how any woman could fall for him without the aid of rohipnol . He does a lot of staring and everything he actually says comes across as about as sincere as a politician on election day. Then the Civil War kicks off and Grigory has to unconvincingly strop off again to do some more wooden acting with explosions. A word on the soundtrack, it is all dubbed very badly. It is done with the one microphone and everyone speaking in a disinterested or shouting is acting kind of way that irritates beyond reason. Whilst they are impassionately snogging their voices are the same volume as when they are just talking about snogging. They all have American accents whilst trying to make it sound like they are pronouncing their `R's' backwards to appear more Russian. Every time an animal appears we have a badly dubbed whinnying (horse) squawk (fowls) or arfing for the dogs, just to let us know an animal is on screen, it is so artificial it grates. We also have the quickest screen birth ever from the fallen (regularly) Aksinia, which is probably Russian for Slattern. This is the German version so if you can read Deutsche, then it may be better with the sound down (who am I kidding?)

It is also very disjointed and this could be explained by the fact this was a TV mini series that has been edited down to a mere three hours. It did seem an awful lot longer as I kept stopping to do urgent odd jobs like dusting the Christmas decorations or cleaning behind the downstairs lavatory, or harvesting naval fluff, so I had quite a bit of pause button time. Still I determined to finish this like a bland meal at a dinner party, but it was a chore.

There are some nice touches though, the framing of shots is exemplary and the lack of CGI commendable on the battle scenes, but the music could have worked if there was more or at least some on screen chemistry from the actors. As such the music has more passion than any of the performances and hence seems a bit over blown, but it would not have been if this was not such an am dram farce. Oh and the narrator is a tw@t too, just annoying in a sort of smug voice over way, if you had a friend who talked like that you would stop speaking to them, being told how the players feel or that there is a war is a bit shallow. God I was going to give this three stars, but on reflection two seems generous, but the cinematography was good, so on balance this is one to avoid or if you must see it then go for a rental.",1334966400,6,3563,4.377643504531722
