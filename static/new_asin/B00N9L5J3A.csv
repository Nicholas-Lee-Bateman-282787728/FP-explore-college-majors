6618727,5,B00N9L5J3A,The perfect family movie - fun for children and adults!  Special Effects were great and kids will love how the kids are the heroes.  This will definitely become a family classic at our house.,1417478400,7,191,4.588235294117647

6618732,5,B00N9L5J3A,Very enjoyable and different than watching the traditional ones.  I recommend it.,1513641600,,81,5.75
6618733,3,B00N9L5J3A,"Basically knew this going in, but...
Bad writing, bad acting
cute-ish story
And hey, It's about Christmas (mostly) and Dragons (sort of)",1513468800,,136,5.2272727272727275
6618734,5,B00N9L5J3A,"whew, finally a good christmas movie with some imagination.  This is great for a family of boys and girls.  Loved it so much.",1513382400,2,125,4.391304347826087
6618735,2,B00N9L5J3A,"I really wanted to like this from the description, but it just lacks that warm feeling you get with Christmas stories.  It never really grabbed my interest, and I felt no connection with the characters.  There are good Christmas movies out there--watch them instead.",1513382400,,266,5.0227272727272725
6618736,3,B00N9L5J3A,I like the story idea. There were parts that were endearing to me. The graphics when the girl meets the dragon nearly brought a tear to my eye. Some of the acting is pretty bad. There are parts that are laughable for the wrong reasons. Glad I watched this non-traditional Christmas flick overall.,1513296000,2,296,4.60377358490566
6618737,2,B00N9L5J3A,"Hard to sit through as adults. My husband and I thought it was awful: awful acting, makeup, special effects, storyline. The actors could not even keep the same accent. So bad at times we laughed. 2 stars because our 5-year-old enjoyed it and gave it 4 stars. He gave Paw Pups 5 stars. Too bad us adults had to sit through it with him.",1513209600,,334,4.234375

6618740,4,B00N9L5J3A,"A different type of Christmas story.  But good all the same. Just not for young children maybe age 10 and up. Too many scary parts and to me a touch of horror with the appearance of the goblins and the Ogre.  A story about orphans and even an orphan dragon.

The kids set out to find Christmas magic and run into many different obstacles on their journey.",1511654400,2,355,4.268656716417911

6618742,4,B00N9L5J3A,"This is a christmas adventure movie that children would love.  It has a touch of romance, a lot of adventure, and 5 mischievous orphans who end up saving Christmas with help from Father Christmas's son and a butt-kicking female elf.",1502496000,3,232,4.8
6618743,1,B00N9L5J3A,Bought these for my grandchildren and they all hated it. Not what I expected or what the reviews read.,1495065600,,102,4.421052631578948

6618745,1,B00N9L5J3A,Terrible movie. Not good for children to watch parents get burned alive in the first 10 minutes. Not worth the time or money,1488758400,,124,4.434782608695652

6618748,5,B00N9L5J3A,"Really good movie!! So good we had to buy it!! Great adventure, good story line! Not for little kids as some themes and characters might scare them. If tgey can handle tge wicked witch and flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz they should be able to watch. Pop some corn and settle in for some good fun!!",1485561600,2,301,4.206896551724138

6618757,1,B00N9L5J3A,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter so we waited for three months to open it and watch it and the last scene in the movie freezes and won't finish.  Way to go - you put a big black eye on the Christmas experience for a ten year old girl.,1482624000,,243,3.764705882352941
6618758,4,B00N9L5J3A,"My nine year old daughter watched this. She enjoyed watching the adventure the children in the film went on, and the idea of trying to get Christmas back. I wasn't a huge fan, but I don't always want to watch kids movies. It seemed to be appropriate for her to watch alone.",1482019200,2,273,4.269230769230769
6618759,1,B00N9L5J3A,Was very amateur. Almost laughably bad in some places. Our family quit watching it halfway through. Don't bother.,1482019200,,113,5.333333333333333

6618762,4,B00N9L5J3A,"B movie but cute, different from the normal Santa story, an adventure to rescue Christmas but without the north pole. The way the actors are not the most high level still makes it a very cute movie.",1480809600,,198,4.378378378378378
6618763,1,B00N9L5J3A,"Everyone fell asleep during the movie. Not ideal for young ones either. Creepy, possesed looking Elves, and dragons that burn people alive in the few mintues of the movie . The acting could be better. Seemed like a very low budget movie. We never made it to the end. I thought after seeing other reviews it would be similar to "" how to train your dragon"" or maybe even a Harry potter type. Not at all.",1480636800,3,401,4.2894736842105265

6618803,5,B00N9L5J3A,"My family and I enjoy this one very much, so much that it's become a holiday favorite in our household. The story is very sweet, the magic of Christmas is dying, and so a group of young orphans (who due to their poverty and status as orphans had never known the magic of Christmas themselves) set out to restore it and save it for everyone, and by doing so, these children bond into the family which they'd been lacking their whole lives. Great stuff, and the youthful cast did a terrific job. The story is excellent, the acting very strong, while the special effects range from being pretty decent to being uhmm...kind of hokey, but hey, it's clear this film was made on a firm budget, and besides, in my opinion the sometimes dubious effects only add to its charm.

It may not be for everyone, but I (and much more importantly, my children) have really bonded to this film around holiday time. It's the message, it's timeless and beautiful, that whenever you get to feeling sour or cynical about Christmas, you need to endeavor to find what it once was to you and what it will always be within a child's heart.",1452729600,2,1112,4.477832512315271

Horrible.  Truly horrible.

I know, as a parent, I'm supposed to be subjected to mediocre children's fare, but this was especially terrible, and I wish I could exact some kind of vengeance upon the creators of this dreck.",1451779200,5,410,4.652777777777778
6618806,5,B00N9L5J3A,great movie as an adult I enjoyed it. would not show it younger elementary age only because it might upset them with a scene or two.,1451520000,,132,4.115384615384615
6618807,3,B00N9L5J3A,"Almost too scary for our 7 year old boy, and SUPER cheesy. Don't let the name 'dragon' in the title fool you - we only see dragons 5 or 6 times in the entire movie. Cheesy CGI....",1451174400,,179,3.864864864864865
6618808,3,B00N9L5J3A,"I wish it had the financing of a big budget movie studio, as I think some of the annoying issues would have been smoothed out.  It definitely seems like a labor of love for the filmmaker.  Everyone 14 and up in my household thought it was 'kinda cheesy', but everyone under 14 seemed to like it.  I really wanted it to have the magic of a Sandlot or Goonies.  It tries, but misses slightly as the characters don't have time to be developed into their own personalities.  (Except maybe for Fin, who delivers some good lines).

The good:
The cinematography and landscapes are at times, breathtaking.
The score and music are at times, on par with big budget movies
The special effects are manageable.
There are decent one-liners (mostly by Fin)
I like the idea of an adventure/quest movie with kids saving Christmas
Most of the actors were decent

The bad:
The plot itself stumbles along at times
The makeup/hair on the characters is odd - inspired by Pirates of Caribbean and Peter Pan and the Lost Boys?
The movie itself seems to 'borrow' plot lines from many different movies.  My family and I made a game of how many different movie references we could pick out.  For example, cutting the beehive down to get away from bad guys (Hunger Games).
There is very little Dragon in the movie, so the title is a bit misleading.

The ugly:
There are British accents, Irish accents and regular American accents which take away from the authenticity of the time period.
The acting by some is terrible, to the point I wondered how they might be related to the director.",1451174400,5,1558,4.592057761732852

6618816,2,B00N9L5J3A,"***SPOILER WARNING***

Wow, where do I begin?

1. The cover of this movie is extremely misleading, as is the title. Like, There are no Christmas trees, there is not even a flake of snow until the very end, and the dragon has next-to-nothing to do with the whole thing - oh, one killed the main girl's parents and made her an orphan and that's why she's in an orphanage and fears dragons.
2. I'm pretty sure the writers were just ripping off parts of Lord of the Rings and How to Train Your Dragon.
3. The entire movie, it was not at all obvious that Christmas itself was under attack - halfway through, it was only apparent that Father Christmas was struggling. I feel like whoever conceived this monstrosity kind of felt like making a Christmas-themed movie, but wanted to do an ""adventure""/""fantasy"" movie the most, so they sort of just mixed those three things together.
4. What the crap is up with the wacky hair & shoddy makeup?
5. IMO, the dragons are the best actors in the movie, and really they are just overly-CG Toothless knock-offs. Oh, and the cinematography & music were the only decent parts of the whole mess.
6. THE ACCENTS. No consistency, no authenticity, no effort whatsoever. I can't even.
7. My favorite part of this movie was when Saerwen went to blow dust off of a book and like zero dust could be seen.
8. There were a few times that I could tell a scene was meant to be humorous, but I never even cracked a smile. Mostly I smirked at how horrendous the acting/script writing was.
9. I DID laugh at the Ogre's costume, Airk's inconsistent eyeliner (actually, his whole existence - SON of Father Christmas? What the flip?), and that part where the Elf Girl finished fighting the bad guys and removed her hood to reveal her identity.
10. My husband wasn't exactly watching the movie with me, but when he saw who was supposed to be Father Christmas he seriously thought it was Merlin.
11. Elf Girl fighting dragon hunters & forced romantic scenes. *Yawn*
12. So, the only reason I even got through this movie all the way to the end was because I knew it would be fun to write a good (awful?) review of the full thing.
13. Why didn't Father Christmas have reindeer? How in the heck did his wife die if he himself has lived for like a thousand years? Why does he sound Scottish? Why did the make the ultimate-predictable move and have the kids go live up North with him?
14. WHY DID THEY THROW THEIR FOOD AWAY DURING A STUPID, UNREALISTIC CHASE??
15. It doesn't help that I have seen most of these actors in other terrible-quality movies.
16. If I was the one naming this movie, I would call it ""Ayden's Adventure"", because literally 2% of it actually relates to Christmas. Mostly I wondered if it was a parody of a bunch of other fantasy/adventure shows & movies, like Bored Short TV's ""The Wand of Universal Power"", or Studio C's sketches based around LotR & Harry Potter. Frankly, it reminded me of Screen Junkie's Honest Trailer for LotR more than anything - ""walking, more walking, aaaand strolling"". I'd be more interested in watching an Honest Trailer of this movie than the actual movie itself again. It's shocking to think that this was actually passed off as a serious story.
17. The Goblins. What, did each of the Goblin actors go to Taylor Maid, pick a LotR mask & creepy clown hair and then apply those things themselves without the help of a professional or even amateur makeup artist?
18. THE SNARL. WUT. Did they take that straight from a Dr. Seuss book or something??
19. WHY DO THEY NEED A DRAGON TO FLY THEM AROUND IN A SLEIGH WHEN THEY LITERALLY TRAVELED FOR *THREE* DAYS TO GET TO WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE NORTH POLE??? Oh, to tie in the ""Christmas Dragon"" title. I get it now.
20. The only reason I am giving this movie 2 stars is because it actually isn't the worst one I have seen, so it doesn't quite deserve 1 star (Pendragon, anyone?).

Going into this movie, I was expecting it to be pretty poor quality (my little brothers & sisters watched it and were utterly confused at basically everything), but I didn't think it would be quite the mess that it is. Whoever thought this could even remotely pass as a ""Christmas"" movie needs their head examined.

I do hope that these kids go on to have good acting careers, despite the crappy parts they have played in crappy movies.

After all of that, I am severely judging the reviews for this movie that are above two stars. Maybe I just saw a different movie from everyone else. In that case, please link to the movie that you watched so that I can be enlightened!",1450569600,3,4558,4.4735576923076925

Besides, this is DEFINITELY a kids movie. I actually thought Bailee Michelle Johnson did alright, especially considering the mess of a script they had to deal with. The most graphic violence gets shown in the first 10 minutes or so (a cut arm, and some people dying in a fire), but this movie is actually rather tame. Still, bad script, gaping holes in the plot.",1450396800,3,505,4.611111111111111

Is it live-action, when it seems like it should be a cartoon? Yep. Is it more than a tad predictable? Certainly. BUT...we laughed and smirked and even cried a little bit regardless. It's cute and something different, and it made a pleasant diversion to watch together.

I am still confused on why the makeup and the costumes look as if they were borrowed from Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't think the movie was as ""dark"" as others have described it. This is coming from a Waldorf, conservative mother who researches what my daughter watches. I think 8 and up is fine, and most 6 year olds would be fine with it. The story line is great, however,  I wonder why they cast some actors with accents and others with a modern, american tone. Didn't make sense. It also bothered me why children had makeup on in the movie. That all being said, the animation was realistic and the dragon was super cute and my 11 year old daughter declared, ""This is now my new favorite movie besides Tuck Everlasting!""

While other posts I felt it had some dark points, there is no blood and gore or visual killing. I found it no more dark than many other childhood stories/fairy tales that are read to and viewed by children every day. Preview it and assure you find it fit for child, as you should do routinely, then watch it with them. I feel you won't mind viewing it a second time yourself.

Orphan and Babe-in-waiting Rosalynne (Paris Warner) plays her frenemy providing us with conflict when the film lacks bandits, goblins, and dragons.

This is a heart warming film for those that can make it through till the end. This is done by the same Utah group that has created Mythica, Survivor, Osombie, and that disaster Orc Wars which they re-titled Drangonfyre. (It was still bad under the new name.) The production lacks acting and a plot line that keeps you engaged. Of course the film is all well that ends well except for Garret (Talon G. Ackerman) who was sold into child slavery and never heard from again. What writer dropped the ball on that? Some blood in the beginning. Fight scenes become rather lame afterwards, even for a kid's film. Four people with the surname Johnson in this film. My guess is that they are all related.

6618843,2,B00N9L5J3A,"I understand that this is a low-budget, independent film, made without the aid of the major Hollywood studios and their special effects houses.  I understand that such films can't be held to the same standards of quality in terms of CGI and effects as the higher-budget films, and that some allowances have to be made.  And I understand that there are people who long to make a film of their own but don't have access to the funds, equipment, and studio system to create something up to the par of, say ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Avengers.""  But all the same, an independently-made film should STILL abide by some standard of quality, especially when it comes to acting and a coherent script.  And a low budget doesn't excuse bad writing or acting -- one doesn't need a million-dollar budget to create a well-written or well-acted movie, just as a huge budget doesn't guarantee good acting or a good script.

I can see where the makers of ""The Christmas Dragon"" honestly tried -- they wanted to make a fantasy tale with a holiday flavor to it, and the idea itself had potential.  But the execution was flawed.

In a fantasy land that closely resembles medieval Europe, a teen girl named Ayden lives with a group of orphans, having lost her parents to a dragon years ago.  The orphans face a dismal future, as children without a parent to be apprenticed to will be sold as slaves when they come of age, but Ayden keeps her friends' hopes alive by telling them tales of Father Christmas... who is being regarded as little more than a myth, as Christmas hasn't come to the land for several years now.  When a dying elf gives Ayden a crystal, telling her that the magic of the North is dying and she must find a way to save it, she gathers her fellow orphans and makes the journey to the North to find Father Christmas and save the magic there.  Along the way she must face goblins, ogres, and ruthless slave hunters... and finds unexpected allies in a thief who knows more than he lets on about the North, an elf with a fiery temper and her own connection to Father Christmas, and an injured baby dragon who just might be the key to saving Christmas.

The plot of this book is a mishmash of fantasy elements that never feel like they quite gel together.  There are some intriguing concepts, such as elves turning into goblins when they lose their magic, but they feel mostly inconsequential to the story at large.  And many elements feel rather clich, such as the crystal that gives Father Christmas his power (is it me or are crystals becoming way overused in fantasy anymore?), the evil forest, the slave hunters, etc.  Also, it's never quite made clear whether this story takes place in a fantasy world or in medieval Europe... and that raises its own set of problems.  If it's a fantasy land, how does Christmas exist there?  If it's medieval Europe, how are the fantasy elements explained?  No explanation is given.  Also, the entire film looks like it takes place in the spring or summer -- so how can it be Christmas?  Even the ""North"" looks oddly warm and lacks any sign of snow...

As mentioned before, the special effects in this film feel rather cheap.  I can understand a film like this isn't going to have enough of a budget for ""Lord of the Rings"" levels of realism, but even so, I never felt fully immersed enough in this film to forget I was watching CGI.  Said CGI looks like it comes straight out of a video game, and just looks laughable.  Also, most of the costumes and sets look rather cheap.  I'll cut the film some slack for the special effects, but still, it's jarring to look at.

Good acting probably could have saved this film, but sadly, every actor either over-emotes or is completely flat and dull.  Also, some of the actors adopt strange accents, which would have been fine had any consistency been shown... but no two accents seemed to be the same, and most of the kids don't even try.  At least the woman playing the leader of the slave hunters seemed to be enjoying herself, and played her ""obviously evil"" role with visible relish.  Everyone else seems to be hamming it up or phoning it in.

I do give the film credit for trying to be an epic fantasy with a holiday flavor -- and I will admit that I thought the dragon was cute.  But the titular dragon barely plays any role in the story itself, which makes the entire film feel like it was mis-labeled.  Perhaps ""The Christmas Crystal"" or ""The Christmas Orb"" would have been a better name, as the crystalline orb played a much larger role in the story than the dragon.  I guess the filmmakers were hoping to draw in the ""How To Train Your Dragon"" crowd...

I understand that this is an independent film that doesn't have a Hollywood budget, but I was expecting a little more effort, or at least a coherent story that wasn't quite so clich.  It's entertaining enough, but if you want a quality fantasy-themed holiday story, I would recommend ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" (the Rankin-Bass version) or the ""How To Train Your Dragon"" Christmas special ""Gift of the Night Fury.""  Save this one for if you have nothing else to watch -- though I wouldn't show it to kids under 8, as it has some frightening scenes and even onscreen deaths, especially in the first ten minutes or so.",1421193600,2,5267,4.520042194092827

6618846,1,B00N9L5J3A,"I was looking for a movie to get my grandparents for Christmas. They are devout Latter-Day-Saints so I was searching for a clean movie at Deseret Book. I had never heard of this movie before but checked the Amazon reviews. One person compared it to the Hobbit, and another person compared it to Elf. Those misleading 5-star ratings led me to spent $20 on absolute garbage. This was without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.

The movie starts off with some thieves asking a family to pay their tax to the king. The family refused and a fight pursues. While the daughter is running away she comes across some dragon eggs. A dragon then appears and injures the daughters, and sets flame to her parents and some other bad guys. The graphics are beyond bad, but I'm going to stick to the real reason I hated this movie.

Skip forward and the daughter from earlier is with her orphan friends and they are on a quest to save Christmas. They go on an adventure which is full of unexplained danger. I think my personal favorite was a band of men with makeup that makes them look like members of KISS. The epic fight scenes could be compared to such 80's movies as ""3 Ninjas"", or ""Home Alone"". The children simply have to kick an adult and they fall over defeated. It was very childish. However, this movie cannot be recommended for children. Remember, her parents go up in flames from a dragon in the first scene.

Spoilers ahead: The girl and her orphan friends then find a baby dragon. It helps them ""Save Christmas"". I guess the moral of the story was supposed to be about forgiveness. ""Even if a dragon kills your parents, not all dragons are bad. The End."" I did not feel like any of the characters are developed enough that you care what happens to them. I am at a loss as to what age group this is supposed to be for? Certainly not children, they would be too scared. Anyone older would be bored to tears.
