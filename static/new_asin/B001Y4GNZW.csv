3829599,5,B001Y4GNZW,The newer box set may have a lot of extras like interviews and such however it does not include the movie.  That was my biggest decision maker as I do own the movie but on VHS.  The artwork postcards and book that it comes with are fantastic and it also doesn't take up a ton of room on my shelf thanks to the movies being inside I nice booklet of cardboard sleeves.,1299542400,,366,4.069444444444445
3829600,5,B001Y4GNZW,"If you are a transformers fan this is a great addition to have to any dvd collection. Has lots of the shows you can watch over and over again. Its something really nice to pass down to the young ones, who may have not seen the older shows that we have.",1285372800,,252,3.9607843137254903
3829601,4,B001Y4GNZW,"Plain and simple... this is a nice Chinese Collectors Edition... of the Rhino DVDs... which means, yes, you still have to deal with those ""nostalgic"" (read, lame as h***)added sound effects... but what's different?

Well, the cool booklet has Chinese text along with nice art... and what look like some gift cards with said art, as well as a spiffy Autobot keychain... that is, unless the seller decided to keep all of that for themselves. And the actual DVD menus are mapped to the Autobot symbol, and not hard at all to figure out how to navigate, and while you get the lame sound effects, at least you also get the English audio track with them, so anyone who wanted to score the series in one shot...

... would actually be better off buying the Shout! Factory set at this point. At least they get points for including the movie...",1258761600,2,835,4.56
3829602,5,B001Y4GNZW,It's a cool set except I can't figure out how to change the movie from chinese to english. But everything else is great.,1258156800,,120,4.260869565217392
3829603,5,B001Y4GNZW,"After I owned all of He-Man, Voltron and The Thundercats episodes I really wanted the Transformers on Dvd to complete an 8:00pm 4 block.  Frustrated because I could not separate the original airng from other series. I typed in Transformers in a search engine and everything came up but what I wanted. Stumbled upon a website called Dvdbyte and finally found it. They have episode list that corresond with reasonable disc order. Then found out it is called Generation One, or G1. I waited too long and was not going to wait for the official release. I got the full 98 episodes for approximatley the same amount of dollars, very neatly packaged included with another copy of the movie, autobot key chain and cards of master drawings. Comparing the quality of both movie issues is no different. If it were not for Dvdbyte I would still be waiting. I lucked out.
 Once received  as a belated Christmas gift I was still frustrated,  as  I said before I need a region free Dvd player. I don't intend to offend anyone, but figuring out how to tranform a transformer without using the manual was easier than than playing each episode without a manual in English .
On the screen that has the Red White and Blue Autobot Face Insignia.
Cursor to its right cheekside.  Click Enter.
Then cursor and highlite the desired episode number. <12345678> The top left square is the beggining of every episode.
Each episode will default to Chinese, but it will have a bilingual switch. Every remote control is different so I can't be of more help.
  I now am watching them a second time once a weak as Friday Night Specials. Viva! Transformers.

3829604,4,B001Y4GNZW,"This is a great tin boxed set from China. All episodes and the movie with an extra disc with supplements. Also comes with some art post cards and a key chain. The overall presentation is great...the tin box itself is really nice and it comes in this cardboard box wrapped in bubblewrap. Overall...I am pleased. The only complaints i have are that each of the discs are in this protector wrap and placed in a cardboard sleeve...each together as a book. Some of my discs had small scratches. I wish they were in some sort of keep case but oh well. You have to switch over to english, but the movie doesn't come in english, just 3 different asian languages. Other than that...I like it and am pleased to have it in my collection. I still plan to buy the Shout! Factory box set. But I recommend this set as well.",1257724800,3,808,4.357615894039735

3829606,5,B001Y4GNZW,I bought this for my husband. He is a big GEEK when it comes to the Transormers. All in all they are good little shows. I recommend it to all.,1251417600,,142,3.7666666666666666
3829607,5,B001Y4GNZW,"Everything was amazing I got it a few days after I ordered it the only problem I had was the UPS guy dropped my box. Everything was in great condition though, well packaged and on time.",1249603200,3,185,4.166666666666667
8347975,5,B001Y4GNZW,"I used to sell this set several years ago and it was a nice set all four seasons , the animated movie "" all region code"" artwork, collectible key fob. All in an embossed metal case.
Comes all region code.
This is better than anything released in the US.
Occasionally they come up on eBay and are worth getting hold of. !!",1507075200,,321,4.193548387096774
8347976,1,B001Y4GNZW,"The content on the disks themselves is fine, but it really doesn't matter, since almost all of my disks now have severe disk rot and are unplayable.

The set is otherwise pretty nice, but I feel like nothing else really maters if the disks don't work anymore. Good thing Shout Factory is still selling their G1 set.",1459555200,,315,4.526315789473684
8347977,5,B001Y4GNZW,this was bought to give to someone as a gift. I am sure they loved it as I never heard a bad word back.,1414886400,,103,3.3333333333333335
8347978,3,B001Y4GNZW,"Bought this in 2007 right before the first live action movie was released for $80 (once the movie came out the price instantly doubled). Anyway, the set itself is great...except, the disks do not last. Went to view it again last week, but ink or oxidation has left huge brown blotches on half of my disks, making them unreadable/unplayable. I see another reviewer had the EXACT same problem. I STRONGLY urge any purchaser to rip these disks when they arrive to harddrive and/or better-quality DVDs.",1386115200,,498,4.870588235294117
8347979,2,B001Y4GNZW,"It didn't come with everything it said it would. It says that it comes with the shopping bag and key chain but I had to contact the seller in order to get him to send me the key chain and shopping bag but he told me he didn't have any more shopping bags, and only had one key chain so he sent me the key chain.",1383955200,,310,3.712121212121212
8347980,5,B001Y4GNZW,i gave the transformers g1 box set the five stars rating because its the box set of the shows that goes WITH THE SONY 2 DISC SET AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOX SET TO ANY TRANSFORMERS FAN.,1380240000,,188,3.973684210526316
8347981,5,B001Y4GNZW,"I grew up with these cartoons in the 80's. Lets face it 99% of anyone who is looking at these probably did. Those who didn't and are interested in it because of the 90's cartoons and the atrocious recent Bay films don't be fooled by the other garbage. This is the original, the real deal, the complete badassery that was the greatest era of cartoons. Just because what is out there now sucks, doesn't mean it always did.

It's great to see a complete collection (minus the movies of course) of the original cartoon. Great story lines, amazing animation and so on. Heck of a deal for a collector of fine anime.

I'm the Damn Batman.",1364515200,,631,4.431034482758621
8347982,3,B001Y4GNZW,"I paid about $50 for this in 2007 or 2008 and watched the first few seasons.  In 2012, I went to try and watch some episodes and the DVDs had developed dark spotches that prevented playback.  I'm not sure if it was the cardboard sleeves in which the DVDs are stored that caused this or simply poor quality DVDs.  Regardless, buyer beward.",1359849600,,338,4.419354838709677
8347983,5,B001Y4GNZW,Episodes look and sound much better. Also comes with the 1986 animated movie which shout factory is too cheap to give you. Pretty sad when even the chinese make better DVD's than you.,1358380800,,183,4.575757575757576
