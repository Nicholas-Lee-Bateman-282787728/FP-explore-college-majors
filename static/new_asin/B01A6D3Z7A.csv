8746613,3,B01A6D3Z7A,"the cover is deceptive; Sandra Bullock is in only one of these movies, and it had to be when she was in her late teens.  Its likely that it was her first movie, ever.  The rest of the movies are ok, but nothing more.",1458777600,6,216,3.8863636363636362
8746614,1,B01A6D3Z7A,"Please note that there is no closed-caption option for any of the films included on this DVD.  In fact, there are no options at all other than which film (of the eight) you want to watch.",1457049600,3,187,4.194444444444445
8746615,2,B01A6D3Z7A,"So far, watched the first 3 movies.  Definitely ""B"" movies.  Acting substandard.  Disappointed in this purchase so far.  Will continue watching to see if there are any redeeming movies.",1454716800,3,185,5.275862068965517
