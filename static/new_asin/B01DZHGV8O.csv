7727397,5,B01DZHGV8O,"I have studied yoga for more than fifty years; teaching for 20 yrs & this is the best chair yoga I have found.  Recently I discovered I have severe scoliosis & can no longer do a lot of what I used to; some days are better than others.  So I have been changing up what I do & since some mornings I feel very fragile.  This morning I did the Gentle Sequence on this dvd & it felt great to my body.  There are two people in a chair & one sitting on the floor.  The instructor has a great voice to lead the class & it is done at a perfect speed.  As I do the other sequences I will come back & add to my review.  In the meantime, if you need some chair yoga this dvd is the best.",1489881600,6,676,3.7183098591549295

7727399,3,B01DZHGV8O,"I thought this would be much more chair bound as I am disabled and was looking for yoga stretching exercises.  However, this has many poses that require a chair to lean on.  I'm sur it's fine for people who can do those things, but not exactly what I was looking for.",1486771200,5,267,4.215686274509804
7727400,5,B01DZHGV8O,"First, I really like Steve's voice -- it's soothing and nurturing!  And the background music is perfect.  (Is it possible to purchase the music soundtrack?!  Really!!)  This DVD can be used as a resource for teachers seeking guidance and new ideas when working with the older population (or, younger people who are in wheelchairs or have difficulty standing).  I've been involved with yoga for 20+ years, and often use yoga books and DVD's to find ""new material"" for my classes.  Currently, I teach 55+ classes and everyone who attends can stand... so, I'm not currently teaching ""chair yoga.""  However, when the time comes, this will be my ""go to"" DVD.  Some senior centers and 55+ communities do not have the funds for visiting yoga teachers; instead, the students or residents gather in a room and exercise with a DVD.  This DVD would work well in those situations. I appreciate that there are options of shorter & longer sequences, and of gentle/moderate/extended sequences.  This DVD yoga program could also be a welcome gift from a son or daughter -- to ""do"" when spending time with a  parent or grandparent in an assisted living community, or at the parent or grandparent's home.  I think the parent or grandparent would treasure the time spent doing something so useful and interesting with their younger family member....don't you?!!!  There is a beautiful relaxation & meditation at the end of the Gentle sequence, the 34 minute program.  Here is a lovely quote from that relaxation and meditation:  ""Your body heals and grows stronger during deep rest, and the more you let go, the more benefit you will receive from your practice today.""  Thank you, Steve, for all the work that went into this program -- it will allow so many more people to reap the awesome benefits of yoga -- which includes a sense of belonging to a healthy community, as well as bod-mind-spirit rewards.",1479340800,10,1886,4.8652037617554855
7727401,5,B01DZHGV8O,Steve Wolf takes a fresh approach to yoga allowing anyone to participate. The ability to practice yoga while seated opens up this ancient tradition to anyone with a desire to learn and grow. As the population ages the need for yoga expands. This well conceived method will benefit anyone wishing to expand their knowledge and practice regardless of physical condition. Bravo!!,1479168000,7,376,5.180327868852459
7727402,5,B01DZHGV8O,The instructor does an excellent job of walking through each of the techniques and at a speed that allows you to experience each technique in an appropriate amount of time.  The organization of the DVD is great and allows the viewer to get to specific areas of interest quickly.  Well done.,1461715200,8,290,4.666666666666667
8757396,5,B01DZHGV8O,"I received this DVD as gift. I love it! I'm 57 and in good shape. I usually run, work out at the gym and don't do much yoga activity, so this was perfect. It made me slow down and really focus, and Steve Wolf's voice is a bonus! Chair Yoga is really wonderful.",1531699200,,260,3.9245283018867925

8757398,5,B01DZHGV8O,"I heard about this chair DVD from a teacher friend who has been using it to get ideas for seniors yoga classes, and having recently purchased Mr. Wolf's ""Savasana"" CD, I thought I'd give this a try.  I wasn't disappointed.  The layout is interesting: There's a basic menu with several practice sequences arranged according to ability and duration, but also a clever ""a la carte"" menu you can use to design your own practice sessions.  I've especially enjoyed the meditation/breathing sequences.  On a lot of the segments there are two people demonstrating the chair yoga adaptation with a third person on the floor demonstrating a more traditional yoga version.  I should also mention that the background music is a cut above what you hear on a lot of these videos.  From what I've seen, so far, this DVD should hold my interest for a while.  I would buy this again.  I attached a screen shot of the main menu.",1525910400,2,910,4.679245283018868
8757399,5,B01DZHGV8O,"I have been exhausted and weak for what seems like a long time now.  I was looking for some way to positively use my body when I got this DVD.  I can't quite handle all of it, but enough so that I'm feeling some life return to me.  Steve Wolf is a wonderful teacher.",1525478400,,266,3.888888888888889

8757402,5,B01DZHGV8O,"Chair Yoga is for every body! A fabulous program for everyone that shows yoga is accessible to all. The DVD provides accommodations for those who need them and I find it most helpful as it brings my yoga practice to my office chair during my workday. Purchased at my local yoga studio, I have shared and purchased additional copies as gifts for many friends.",1512000000,,358,4.609375
