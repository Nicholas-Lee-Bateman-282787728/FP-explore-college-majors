Luca Bigazzi's photography gives us an impressionistic opening scene, perhaps derived from the art house classic Watersmith as Valerio Mastandrea plays a novelist, Guido Montani, curious about his daughter's new swimming instructor Giulia (Valeria Golino). His interest at first takes the form of self deprecating humor.  ""You told her I can't swim?  You did.  Well, it's not true.  I can float.""  Guido is writing a new novel that has overtones of Singing In The Rain, his protagonist falls in love every time it rains.  Another of his characters is a lapdancer.  How does the church view lapdancing, a parishioner wants to know - the dancer does it to impart momentary pleasure to the lonely.  Guido's protagonist also discovers that his new love, Sophia, has run off with an umbrella salesman, and the new novel seems hopeless.

Giulia is far far above her work as a swimming instructor. When the lapdancer's priest visits the lapdance club to experience what his parishioners encounter, the come on sexuality at the club is far less appealing to Bigazzi's camera than Giula's other worldly concern for her clients in the swimming pool.  It isn't gratuitous.  There's a reason for Giulia's ethereal stare.  Her history is a lurid one.  It's a moment of high comedy when the characters in Guido's new novel come together Pirandello style to help him work Giulia into the storyline.  No one ever finishes one of Guido's novels, but if he follows the story of Giulia's development, there's a chance that may finally change.

This film never found an audience.  That doesn't mean it isn't a fine film.  It means we've made a mistake.  And it may be the mark of contemporary Italian cimema as to why.  Everything, even monumental events like infidelity, murder and especially the meaning children bring to our lives, is delivered with the same understated monotone.  So accustomed are we to the histrionics in Fellini movies that we're ill prepared for the new laconic Italian cinema.  And Bigazzi's camera doesn't linger, doesn't allow us too much access, the exact quality we crave from the movies.  We demand entry into every character's innermost secrets, whereas this picture insists on giving its characters the rarest of qualities: privacy.  It's an exquisite and private ending as the attention Giulia's child turns down, is instead given to Guido's daughter.",1309824000,18,2395,5.051020408163265
8424749,5,B004D45NZG,"An excellent film, very sad. About a woman who murdered her husband, and is in prison. She is allowed to go out during the day to an indoor pool, where she is an instructor. Her daughter hates her, so she cannot get her life back together. Even though she has a lover, she commits suicide.",1526515200,,289,4.2727272727272725
8424750,5,B004D45NZG,"In Giulia non esce la sera (Giulia Doesn't Date at Night from 2009, and directed by Giuseppe Piccioni), Valeria Golino gives a poignant and moving performance as the title character, in a bold depiction of the reality that ""life,"" with all its unpredictable ""ups and downs"" can become for many people.

'Guido' ( Valerio Mastandrea), is a writer who's having problems finding inspiration for his next novel. Then one day, when he takes his daughter's place, whom no longer wants to continue with her prepaid swimming lessons; 'Guido' quickly becomes taken with the very pretty, but detached swimming instructor---'Giulia.' He soon discovers a new found inspiration in his ""muse"" (Giulia), whereby he feels drawn in by her sad but expressive face, and foreboding presence. He rightfully senses that she's a tortured and tormented soul, and in spite of everything else going on in his own life, he can't help but become captivated by 'Giulia' and she takes precedence over everything else. He soon learns and discovers the painful secret of her life, from 'Giulia' herself, and 'Guido' is moved to the very core of his being. He comes to realize that ""Love"" is what really matters in life, and no human being can live without it!

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), NR 106 mins.
I highly recommend this poignant and moving film.

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1503705600,,1405,4.995726495726496
