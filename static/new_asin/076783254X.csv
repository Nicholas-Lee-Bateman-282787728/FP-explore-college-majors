14306,1,076783254X,"I enjoy almost anything Melanie Griffith is in, but this one was too silly and unbelievable.  Her character is supposed to be a smart, tough lawyer but she does everything that would either get a real lawyer disbarred, laughed out of court -- or killed.  Beautifully shot, great sets and locations, but everybody is wasted in this dopey script.  Nina Foch is a GREAT witchy woman, but I missed John Ritter completely (fooled by the beard)and had to rewind to catch his scene in the very beginning.",983232000,,497,4.689655172413793
14307,1,076783254X,"Let's see, where to start.  Melanie Griffith is supposed to be one of the best, toughest, smartest defense attorneys in the city, but acts more like a former stripper playing at being a recent law school grad. I guess  seductive whispers, a slinky walk, and tepid one-line comebacks are all it  takes to free rapist/killers.  Realism is non-existent as she voluntarily  gives away key information/evidence to the DA and her powerful adversaries  before the trial even starts.  Her crack investigative team manages to  stumble across valuable clues at the drop of a hat without even a trace of  intelligent, logical, deductive reasoning or sleuthing.  The dialog is  absolutely inane, including an awful scene where this supposedly  hard-boiled attorney (Griffith) who has successfully defended the scum of  the earth, suddenly realizes a full five minutes into the interrogation of  her client (a major slimeball) that she believes his story--that he was  just having kinky sex, slapping his date around, and didn't really kill the  girl--and starts crying at this realization.  Supposed to be touching I'm  sure, but instead it was so out of place and baffling, I cringed while  laughing. In addition there's this weird, pointless side story about a  former client whom she got acquitted, then slept with, only to find out he  was actually guilty of rape all along.  Throughout the movie he repeatedly  calls her and taunts her through her answering machine causing her to  listen for several minutes before unplugging it, or turning it off, or  throwing it against the wall, but never doing anything that makes sense,  like changing her phone number.  Even this elicits no real emotion from  her, she basically sleepwalks through the movie.  But, worst of all, this  movie is boring--no suspense, no thrills, and I didn't care one bit about  the fortunes of any of the characters.  I have really liked Griffith in  several recent movies and do not understand this one at all, except that  she's just horribly miscast--as is everyone in this film.  In fact, why I  even devoted this much time in reviewing this escapes me--except maybe I'll  save someone a few bucks and a couple of wasted hours.",954892800,18,2197,5.002777777777778

7789006,3,076783254X,"I'd love to say it is a really good movie but it just kind of goes by at a slow pace.  Melanie Griffith is always sexy to watch but even she could not help this slow and predicable plot.  It's not a bad movie and it's not a good movie.  You have probably already seen it and just forgot.  It is a forgettable movie so spend your money and time on one of her better films.  Working Girl, A Stranger Among Us, ect.",1383004800,,412,3.9156626506024095
7789007,5,076783254X,This is one of Melanie Griffith's best movies.  It's nice to see her in a role where she isn't the dumb blonde.  She plays the part of a very intelligent attorney.,1327881600,,163,4.225806451612903
7789008,3,076783254X,"Randal Kleiser, the director of this average melodrama, is also the man who directed the classic movie, GREASE.  Hard to believe that he could go from such a high energy classic to such a low key, ultimately average thriller.
Melanie Griffith plays rather vapidly a high profile defense attorney who has just gotten city councilman John Ritter off of a rap.  Earlier in her career, however, Griffith got an accused rapist, played with fearless ham by Craig Sheffer, off and found out later while in bed with him that he did rape the girl.
Tom Berenger plays Jack, Griffith's ex husband, who is also the prosecuting attorney in the murder trial of a rising rap singer who Griffith is defending.
Nina Foch chews up the scenery as the presidential hopeful's mother, and Wade Dominguez underplays the accused rap singer whose rap songs are far from what one would call good.
At any rate, the movie moves along at a predictable pace and we know that there's more to the killing than meets the eye.
By the way, singer Huey Lewis does a pretty good job as Griffith's PI; he at least has some life to him
I Don't know whether Griffith played low key to show her inner strength, but she actually looks totally bored.
Not a waste of time, but it could have been so much better.",1086220800,,1267,4.552631578947368
7789009,2,076783254X,"I was a stupid dolt and actually thought this was a re-make of the Theresa Wright film ""Shadow of A Doubt"". But I misread the title. My stupid mistake.
The plot was a typical murder mystery, and while it was not the best told tale, I was interested in finding out ""who dunnit"". So I stuck around until the end. But there were many elements to this film that I found flawed, or just irritating.
And then there was the cast. I like Melanie Griffith. I like Tom Berenger. However, they could not redeem this film. Melanie Griffith came off as self concious of her beauty and ""super confident""--which grated on my nerves after a while. Berenger was fine in the role he had, but he didn't get a lot screen time. He really should have been billed as a supporting actor, but the impression I got from the film's advertising was that he was a CO-star. His role wasn't all that big (it was important, but not that big). Supporting actor Huey Lewis got more screen time than Berenger! (Not that I minded--I like Lewis.)
It was nice seeing Nina Foch working again too. She's been around forever, and still has what it takes to give a good performance. Also, nice score by Joel Goldsmith (Jerry Goldsmith's son). Still, I wouldn't recommend this film. Rent it if you must.
If you are a big Griffith fan, you might be tempted, but this is certainly not her best roll. Tom Berenger fans will be disappointed--his part isn't all that interesting.",1035676800,9,1431,4.507692307692308
7789010,2,076783254X,"Melanie Griffith must've been strapped for money when she agreed to do this film.  While she is quite good in it and credible in the role, her character does such stupid things -- not very smart for a supposedly smart lawyer.  In an effort to catch a murderer, she actually allows the guy she knows to be the vicious killer into her house...at night...alone...and, of course, no lights are lit so that said killer can jump out at her/us and go ""Boo!""
Well, let me go ""Boo!""  This film is too dumb to be believed.",1028246400,,512,4.368421052631579
7789011,4,076783254X,"Was very surprised how good the movie was.  Didn't have any expectations and I thought Melanie Griffith was great in her role.  There's only one part of the movie that really was cheesy and they could have done without, but all in all, it's a good thriller with some nice twists and turns.",1001635200,4,289,4.433962264150943
