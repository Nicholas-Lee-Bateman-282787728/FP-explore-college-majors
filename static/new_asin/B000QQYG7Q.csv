8196958,3,B000QQYG7Q,"I got this tape years ago in a bargain bin.  This is a single episode of the early 1950's television Flash Gordon, and as usual Steve Holland's shirt gets torn during a fist fight to expose his chest.  The shirt has a couple holes in it even at the start of the episode; maybe it was taped together.  In ""Return of the Androids"" the evildoers want to take over the universe with the previously-deactivated androids and need the three key pieces of information known only to Flash, Dale and Dr. Zarkov of the ""Galactic Bureau of Investigation.""  The ""bad guy"" is a female ruler, influenced by an alien war-lord from an outlawed planet -- not unlike how the Federation works in ""Blake's 7,"" but on a much lower budget.  This episode appears in several DVD collections.  As for this VHS offering, the contents may vary, because the copy I have makes no mention of the episode on the cardboard sleeve, open at both ends, nor on the tape itself.  The tape label is blank, other than the company logo and a copyright, ""MCMLXXXVI Kids Klassics, Inc.  New York, NY 10016"" at the bottom, with three lines in which to write in the correct information, and the spine is stamped ""H-15 HONG KONG.""  The video lacks the chapter title and the image is no better than one might expect from a tape recorded at EP speed, but in a way, given the cheapness of the series this may be appropriate.  I'll give it 3 stars for those wanting something to exercise their VHS machines, but try to find a copy for less than what an Alpha DVD costs.",1309132800,,1519,4.451263537906137
