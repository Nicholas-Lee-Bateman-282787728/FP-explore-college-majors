667589,4,6303506275,"I knew sooner or later I would find a horror film where Boris Karloff did not turn out to be the bad guy!  Set in the 18th-century, ""The Black Castle"" tells of Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene), who believes two of his friends have been murdered by the one-eyed Count von Bruno (Stephen McNally) on his Black Forest estate.  Burton arrives at the castle to investigate and discovers the Count's unhappy wife, Elga (Paula Corday) and his physician, Dr. Meissen (Karloff), are essentially prisoners.  The Count and his giant, mute henchman Gargon (Lon Chaney, Jr.), recognize Burton as the person who had them captured and tortured by natives for ivory poaching in Africa.  They decide to kill Burton during a leopard hunt.
That leopard hunt is the showpiece of this 1952 film directed by Nathan Juran, although the story continues for a while afterwards.  Greene shows why his reputation as a dashing hero of B-movies is well deserved while Karloff shows that you should never count his character out just because he gets killed.  As I indicated above, I like the fact that Karloff gets to play against type, just to confuse everybody.  ""The Black Castle"" is not a great horror film, but it is a solid effort and the leopard hunt is extremely atmospheric.  Well worth a look for fans of Karloff.",996969600,10,1295,4.7757847533632285
667590,4,6303506275,"This isn't as bad as Leonard Maltin's review would indicate. I liked this far better than the Black Room in which Karloff had the lead role. Here, Karloff has a supporting, not a staring role, but the movie is worth a  look. Sets are done nicely, music reminds you of Frankenstein, and acting  is good. Basic plot is about an evil Count who lives in a gothic castle,  and has killed two Englishmen, whom he sought revenge on. Enter Richard  Greene who is out to find what happened to them. In the process, his own  life is in 'grave' danger. I won't ruin the ending, which is as good and  suspenseful as any. Lon Chaney Jr plays a loyal brute butler, Karloff a  doctor of the Count who's not so loyal.",954460800,7,701,4.305343511450381

7849177,2,6303506275,"The Black Castle, 1952 film

It begins in olden times. One man wants to go undercover to discover the truth about a Count von Bruno in Germany. They will spend the night at an inn, The Green Man. The innkeeper does not remember Sterling and Brown. A nobleman enters and creates an argument and a sword fight. The travelers arrive at the castle. The Count imported a leopard from Africa to hunt for sport. Will Becket the Englishman join him? He meets the Counts much younger wife. The black leopard is caged and angry. Their talk tells about their history. The next day the hunters leave in pairs. One hunter falls into a trap, a deep pit. He is attacked by that leopard but a shot from the Count kills the big cat. The Count has a problem with his young wife. She was forced into this marriage. Then she screams! The next day Becket says he must return to London for business.

But later Becket is told by the doctor he must return to the castle at once! Becket is taken to the dungeon and asks about Helga. The Count knows Beckets real name. He tells about the dangers of hunting! After the Count leaves Bromley arrives with keys to free Becket and Helga. But a bell sounds the alarm! Becket and Helga find the exit, but the Count and his men stop them. The doctor gives them a drug to simulate death for ten hours. The Count is very angry! He strikes the doctor, who tells him what he did. He tried his best. The Count kills him anyway. People view the bodies of Becket and Helga before burial. The lids of the coffins are closed for burial. They are placed in a crypt. Will they be buried alive? The Count arrives and gets a surprise. Becket can now marry a widow. And so he returns to London.

This is barely average as a horror movie. It serves as an example of the effects of aristocratic power, which corrupts the holder. Does this remind you of Sir Hugo Baskerville (The Hound of the Baskervilles)? The French Revolution reduced the power of the landed aristocracy. Napoleons invasions to the East ended serfdom in Germany and Austria. Liberal economics ended serfdom in 1863 Russia, 1880's Sweden, and 1912 Hungary. Freed serfs migrated to the cities to create workers for industrial production, or to countries like America, Canada, or Australia.",1471824000,,2257,4.513447432762836
7849178,4,6303506275,"Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene- THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) goes undercover as Richard Beckett, in order to discover what happened to two of his associates. Both have vanished, and all indications are that it had something to do w/ a certain Count Karl von Bruno (Stephen McNally). Burton / Beckett sets off w/ his faithful servant to THE BLACK CASTLE. Upon his arrival at a nearby tavern, swashbuckling daring-do breaks out! Then, they're off to the accursed castle, and what a place it is! The Count is an insufferable, sadistic turd, surrounded by a cadre of D-bag cohorts. Among them is the enigmatic Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff- FRANKENSTEIN, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE MUMMY), and the lumbering behemoth, Gargon (Lon Chaney Jr.- THE WOLF MAN, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, HOUSE OF DRACULA). Of course, the Count's wife (Rita Corday) falls for Burton / Beckett, causing jealousy, treachery, and big game hunting to ensue. A decent film, from a more theatrical time. With definite allusions to THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, TBC is an excellent foray into the darker side of human nature. Karloff fans take note. He's not in it as much as one might think. Still, he's as great as ever! Well worth a viewing...",1471651200,,1206,4.916666666666667

7849184,3,6303506275,"Karloff plays a minor role in The Black Castle, a mild horror film from the early 1950s.  Our hero had a run-in with the Count (an 18th century aristocrat) who killed two of his friends in vengeance for some uprising in Africa.  Arriving incognito at the Count's castle, we get a peak into the stuffy aristocratic life of rich men and fawning women in German society.

Sure there are plot holes -- who feeds the alligators in ""that horrid room"" and why is Lon Chaney's character a mute who grins evily?

The stars of the film seem to have been cast to help with a somewhat pedestrian script.  The costumes are ornate, the castle detail elaborate.  The dark and stormy night, the black leopard and a bit of comic relief make this film entertaining, but not at the level of The Haunted Mansion.
