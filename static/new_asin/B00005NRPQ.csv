1636812,2,B00005NRPQ,"The premise of this flick is as worn as a ragged dish towel. We go with Jack Logan(Joe Lara)who plays a mission specialist who is sent to track down the predictable  lunatic(Udo Kier)who has a device called Doomsdayer capable of destroying every nuclear site on the earth with a magnetic pulse to correct all the wrongs done by this society. Presuming such a device actually exists does the audience actually care if Jack Logan with the perfectly coiffed short doo who runs around with a hand held computer, walks and talks like a monotoned wind-up toy saves the world? I doubt it. This movie insults viewer intelligence. Take the scene where Logan meets an old friend of his who for some silly reason at that moment they meet dresses like a Mexican padre, enjoys blowing things up and calls it ""art"". Being a pyromaniac isn't ""art"" nor should destruction be condoned as such. Or take the scene where the English military man is housed with this tough talking woman whose in charge of putting out agents to deter terrorists, answers the phone and says as he looking at his woman boss: ""Yes Mr. Prime Minister, no, Mr. Prime Minister..."" hangs up and says to her: ""That was the Prime Minister"". She's not stupid or  deaf nor is the audience. Utilizing the tired concept of let's save the world from distruction by equally annoying terrorists at a time when 'happy' films should be released, this dynamically dumb dud needed to be blown up in the cutting room waste basket to save the world. Now that would've been ""art""!",1013817600,6,1519,4.685393258426966

7947718,1,B00005NRPQ,"I've seen/heard better dialog and emotion in '60s era Jame Bond flicks, let alone the original lost in space show. The heroine is always treating this or that but never carries through with anything, the ""hero"" acts more like a robot then a human, in he never shows any emotion. Heck even the plot is muked up. First they claim that the bad guys ""island"" is a super fortress where they can shoot down and or destroy anything that comes at em, then next thing you know several ""nations"" are going all D-day on em by invading by sea/land/air.. Between that and an almost endless supply of pistol clips.. Give this a pass if you've got something better to do.. (like watching paint dry!)",1459123200,,684,4.524193548387097

7947724,2,B00005NRPQ,"I thought this was a cheap made for TV movie. It was like an old ""Man From UNCLE"" but without the clever parts.  The great Udo Kier bravely does his best to breath life into a comatose plot.",1428796800,,190,4.0
7947725,1,B00005NRPQ,"I should have believed the title. ""Doomsdayer"" as a title shows a real lack of imagination. That follows through the entire plot line and the characters. They could have saved a lot of production money if they had hired Flat Stanley, the cardboard cutout, to play the main roles. Jack, in the Jack in the Box commercials, displays a greater range of emotion than the actors in the movie. If I have to choose between Doomsdayer and Plan Nine from Outer Space, I will probably take a nap. Don't waste your time.",1419897600,2,509,4.543478260869565
