If you have a more commercial look(under 5'8"" in most cases), then Working the Runway probably won't help you much.  If you are about to attend a modeling convention, definately get this video as soon as possible, no matter what your look!  A good fifteen minutes is spent on things that models should already know such as investing in comp cards and what to keep in your model's bag.  The rest of the video is spent on teaching you the turns and etiquette of the runway.  There is key information for anyone who does not yet know the turns (expensive modeling schools such as Barbizon will spend hours with you practicing them) and you can really save money with this video!  If you really take the time to practice and execute the turns, you will have a huge advantage in the business over someone with no experience.  Just remember, though, that the thing that agents are looking for in a model is character and personality.  You should always be professional, but don't take it too seriously!  Photographers and clients want someone they can actually have fun with- and that alone will take you a long way.",1013212800,3,1178,4.6521739130434785

I bought this video and it truly helped me become more of a presence in any  situation. I have learned how to appear confident and feminine which is a  great plus in today's business environments. Appearence and confidence is  everything and this video has helped me to always look my best. What a  great video for all women!",953596800,6,464,4.423529411764706

After I ordered this tape I felt like I was ready to do a real fashion show, Working The Runway has not only taught me all the turns and walks of the runway but it  has made me feel more confident about my self.",945043200,3,270,4.0
