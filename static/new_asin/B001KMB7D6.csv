3666566,3,B001KMB7D6,"This movie is everything a horror should be. You got some excellect acting, energetic and likable characters, you have your mystery, questions, suspense and plenty of gore. It's got a great soundtrack too and totally worth the watch.
The plot is a young girl driving home one night runs her car off the road and doesnt realise until she gets home that she hit someone and they are stuck in her front bumper protection bar. Panicked, she doesnt know what to do, tries to help him but he attacks her and she then proceeds to protect herself and kills him.... or so she thinks. Then like Stephen Kings Creepshow 2 story ""The Hitchiker"" its a game of cat and mouse, paranoia and survival.
I think its a fun little flick, get for a Saturday night in with your mates and some popcorn. Its not the most intelligent horror movie you will find but you'll no doubt have a hell of a fun time watching it anyway. 3.5/5 from me.",1264896000,2,915,4.420118343195266
3666567,2,B001KMB7D6,"Director Edna McCallion's Hit and Run (2009) provides some thrills, but there is only a remote semblance of a credible plot.  The writers have some interesting ideas, but do not tie them together very well.  If having a sensible story matters, then you may be disappointed.

On her way home after a night featuring some drinking, Mary Murdock (Laura Breckenridge) swerves off the road, and bumps along through some trees.  A little shaken, but apparently unhurt, Mary heads home.  Later, hearing something in the garage, she is shocked to discover a body impaled on her bumper.  Mary wants to help, but when the man grabs her, she panics and beats him with a golf club until he stops moving.

Believing him dead, she hauls the body into the woods, and in a heavy rain, manages to bury it in a shallow muddy grave.  The victim is Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), a teacher who is bipolar, and has been reported as missing.  Riddled with guilt, Mary confesses the deed to her boyfriend Rick (Christopher Shand) who is surprised, but willing to help her cover up.  When she decides to return to the grave to retrieve some incriminating evidence, she makes a grim discovery, and her world spins further out of control.  Things go completely off the charts, when Emser attacks Mary at home, chewing off part of her ear, and apparently stabbing her a couple of times.  Mary feels the wind in her face, as Emser checks in at home to see his worried wife (Megan Anderson), before heading out on the road one final time.

Laura Breckenridge's performance is quite good, making the most of a script with many logical flaws, and an ending that is a physical impossibility.  What Mary does is fairly understandable, although she has a strange fetish about repairing her bumper.  After surviving the ordeal, instead of getting her wounds treated, she goes to get her Jeep fixed.

Besides having a superhuman will to live, and burning desire for revenge, Emser must have a great sense of direction.  Although gravely injured, he is still able move, track Mary back to her home, and then attack.  With incredible stamina, the guy is also apparently a hell of a sprinter.

Although delivering some scares, Hit And Run scores low marks for believability, and is definitely a lightweight entry in the horror genre.  If that's not an issue, then it probably rates at least a rental.",1258156800,,2362,4.756756756756757
3666568,5,B001KMB7D6,I watch alot of horror movies & just loved Hit and Run. Kept my interest on wanting to see what was going to happen next. I rented this movie then had to come to Amazon to buy it. I highly recommend this movie!,1239753600,7,210,3.9069767441860463
3666569,2,B001KMB7D6,"Films such as this and Stuck, which this film seems to borrow heavily from, have a difficult task laid out before them. They have to make the viewer feel for the heroines' when they have gotten behind the wheel after too much to drink and hit someone. While Mary of this film seems likeable, once she made the mistake of getting behind the wheel, my concern for her was pancaked. Fortunately, her ridiculous choice was slightly redeemed after the man she hit turns out to be quite unhinged. This is not to say that it is good she hit the man... it isn't... and most everything that happened in the film could be blamed on her reckless habits.
So, what starts out as a rather generic genre piece is rescued after she discovers that the man she thought she killed is actually not dead and he serves up a bit of frightening revenge. How, I don't want to reveal... but it was quite diabolical even if it really didn't really follow through with its promise of a gory finish.
And then it had that ending... which was ok but not great when featured with the violent turbulence beforehand. So, to sum up... a ho-hum begining, a wicked third act, and a dim conclusion... nothing to write home about.",1239667200,,1191,4.467889908256881
3666570,2,B001KMB7D6,"This film starts out with an interesting premise. In fact, its premise might almost have allowed it to advertise itself as being ""based on a true story."" There was the actual case of a woman who plowed into a man with her car, then let him die slowly impaled on her hood over a period of hours. This incident could have been the inspiration for a really good story of ghastly, ghostly revenge.

However, ""Hit and Run"" doesn't permit itself to gather any momentum from this promising material for horror. After the first half hour or so of suspense, it just runs downhill and degenerates into a rather mindless gore-fest. What's more, a lot of the acting is amateurish. And the boyfriend in the plot is scripted as such a totally unlikable lout, it's impossible to care what happens to him.

So all in all, I suggest you pass this one and leave it in your dust.",1239148800,,860,4.471337579617835
3666571,4,B001KMB7D6,"""Hit and Run"" was very reminiscent of the movie ""Stuck""..Stuck being much more clever but Hit and Run being more chilling in that the guy the girl hits with her car becomes very freaky looking and downright terrifying the further into the story you get.

What happens is a  semi drunk girl hits a guy with her car unbeknownst to her  on her way home from a bar and he winds up stuck to her bumper in her garage looking like he's half dead blood gurgling from his mouth and just plain TORE UP..
She goes inside to call 911 but hangs up thinking she will get into trouble because she had been drinking so she goes back to the garage to tell him she is going to try and help him and he lunges for her clawing at her still attached to the front bumper.

She panics and whacks him with a golf club.
Next thing you see is her pulling him off his impalement on the bumper and buries him in a shallow grave. Next her boyfriend gets involved with not so nice consequences and lets just say that the man she hit has a history of mental problems and seems impossible to kill .. the 2 play cat and mouse for what makes quite a thrilling and in my opinion pretty scary little horror film .",1238889600,15,1176,4.122270742358078
3666572,4,B001KMB7D6,"The description on the back of the DVD sounded like a good exciting story so I went for it, and it didn't disappoint either.  This is a good rollercoster type of story, full of somewhat unexpected things.  A girl drives home from a night on the town and had too much to drink.  When he loses control of her jeep it veers into a part of the nearby woods.  She seems to be lucky though and manages to drive home without getting into an accident.  But this isen't all that it seems, because without her actually noticing it, she hit a man while driving back home.  At first she dosent' notice a thing, but then when she feels that something is amiss she goes back to the garage where she parked her jeep, to find the body of a man who's severly injured.  She tried to help this man but all of a sudden he grabs her, apparently to seek his revenge for being hit by the girl.  The girl then panics and kills the man with a gulf club.  Since her parents are gone for the weekend she decided to hide the body in the nearby woods.  From here on the movie picks up speed and the suspense increases.  I don't want to give away the plot, but rest asured this one is a good thriller worth seeing. The end will baffle you.",1235520000,7,1209,4.1239316239316235
3666573,5,B001KMB7D6,"Seen lot of horror movies, this one isn't bad at all.

The actress does a good performance as Mary. Some decent twists, and Kevin Corrigan is a crazy bad villain. The girl drives home from a party and hits a man at night with her car, but she doesn't know it. SHe brings him home on her bumper, finds him, tries to help, only it ends up she kills and buries him in the woods. But he's alive and seeks revenge!",1234396800,,409,4.049382716049383

3666587,4,B001KMB7D6,"Mary (CSI Laura Breckenridge) gets a little toasted one night and happens to impale the local bipolar kindergarten teacher to the front of her vehicle. (I hate it when that happens.) Eventually the guys dies and Mary in a panic drives out to a secluded spot in New Jersey and plants him. She gets scared and makes the mistake of telling her immature boyfriend Rick (Christopher Shand) who seems more interested in scoring than helping her.

Weird things start to happen and the movie feels like a modern version of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" until the corpse starts walking around. Interesting horror film. Good job Laura. Worth a view.

3666588,5,B001KMB7D6,"I love scary movies.  And I finally had to write a review for this little gem, since I am watching it again tonight after having this movie in my possession for almost a year.  It's one of those movies that you watch when you just want to escape and be taken on a joy ride.  Where scary things happen  - to other people - and you can sit comfortably in your living room and go along with them as they try to get out of a terrible situation.  This movie is not Oscar material, but it wasn't meant to be.  We are invited to a day in the life of a spoiled rich teen out on spring break, drinking with her girlfriends and fending off her boyfriend for the night.  She drank too much and she is tired.  So she jumps in her jeep with the ridiculous headlights on the top and heads home.  She runs off the road after trying to avoid something in the road and has a bumpy few seconds of a ride, but all seems well so she continues on home.  Too bad she didn't inspect the car before going to bed.

After viewing this movie as many times as I have, I have come to appreciate the skill of the young actress, Laura Breckenridge.  She gives an amazing, natural, and spontaneous performance.  The wonderful Kevin Corrigan, the actor who plays the victim in this movie, is one of the creepiest villains I have come across in horror movies.  There is one scene where he is standing in the road, facing her jeep, and his visage is pure evil and insanity.  Scary stuff indeed.  I like the twists and turns this movie takes and I loved the ending, because by then all tables have turned.  I found it very believable and this is probably what makes it so horrible.  And fun.  I appreciate this movie for what it is - a very well made thriller, perfectly paced, that is meant to make you thankful that you aren't Mary.  No matter how many times you watch it.",1310083200,8,1838,4.1971428571428575
3666589,4,B001KMB7D6,"With a title like hit and run, it almost seems like the same ol' same ol'. Someone gets hit, and it becomes some kind of ghost or super human monster haunting the person right? Not so. From beginning to end, 'Hit and Run' has alot of different twists and turns along the way keeping your attention the whole time. The movie itself has been reviewed enough as to what it's about so I won't get into that.

  Good movie, good plot, different, never a dull moment, and definitely worth checking out. I'm glad I did.",1300924800,3,512,4.368421052631579

I'd say a bit in the style of Creepshow 2's hitch-hiker episode.
It's kind of a horror with thriller parts. Mary finds she accidentally hit and brought home a man (kevin corrigan) on her bumper, so she buries him but he's back for revenge.",1290297600,,339,4.557377049180328
3666592,1,B001KMB7D6,"Some of this review could contain spoilers - because the movie is that lame.

The movie was horrible all the way around.  The script, the acting and the music.  I found the actress who played Mary to be very annoying and flat. I was also glad the script offed Mary's boyfriend, Rick, early.  Rick's character was wooden and flat as well.  He spoke the words but they seemed spoken and lacking in emotion.  The script was horrible...Mary hits a guy with her Jeep and manages to drive all the way home with him stuck to her bumper; yet, she doesn't know it until a few hours later when she wakes up in the middle of the night due to flashbacks???  I realize it is a movie for entertainment purposes but....really??  How much suspended disbelief is the audience suppose to exert?  Oh and the sing along Mary does in the beginning on the drive home...well, I had the urge to strap her to my bumper and drive down the highway....or wait that does happen to her after all...**yawn**",1290297600,3,976,4.468926553672317
3666593,1,B001KMB7D6,"when i wasted my money on this crap i was expecting more of a good suspense/horror but it was total bore it didn't provide none of that. This boring movie was about a girl getting drunk with her friends and she drives home drunk apparently not knowing she hit someone which the man was dragging under the car the whole time she drove home, she discovers him and instead of doing the right thing like call the cops she tries to hide him while still alive, He comes back and is on a vengeful rage and starts to terrorize the girl, and to top it all off he is bipolar which makes him a even more raving psychopath. this whole movie sucked (i was hoping more of a JOYRIDE type revenge movie) and the ending was very stupid.

I can't really tell you much more then that without spoiling the plot for you. But I can tell you that the first half of the movie was going really good, then halfway through it takes a different turn then I expected, and by the time the thing was over, i really wished they had made a better ending. I was expecting and ending where it turned out she was just... well, no, I'll write about that on IMDB, not here, else it will give away what happens for those of you who haven't seen it and want to.

I'd give the first half of the movie 3 and half stars, the second half 2 and a half, and the ending 1 star. Over all, i'd say it's one of those movies that sucks you in, but leaves you disappointed by the end of it. It's not a bad movie tho, there is far worse films out there. Its a bit of a thriller and has a bit of suspense, but it's not what I would classify as a horror movie. If the trailer or plot interests you, check it out, if you are hoping it might be a brilliant film that deserves more recognition, you won't find much in this one.
