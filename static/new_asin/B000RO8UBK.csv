8201902,2,B000RO8UBK,"RELEASED TO TV in 2007 and written/directed by Pat Higgins, ""KillerKiller takes place in a ramshackle prison-asylum housing only serial killers. One morn the doors to the cells are mysteriously open, the building seems to have aged overnight and the guards have all disappeared, but an impenetrable mist encompasses the facility, preventing the small number of remaining prisoners from escaping. They start getting killed one-by-one as they bicker, fight and blame each other. Interestingly, the curvy blonde that's slaying them looks like a traditional serial killer victim: A babysitter in a shower, a camper, a cheerleader, etc.

This is a talky slasher and I was unable to make out quite a bit of the mumbled British dialogue. Too bad the DVD didn't supply subtitles because a dialogue-driven picture like this demands that the verbiage be understood. (If you're from the UK this probably won't be a problem).

The rundown hospital is a great setting for a horror flick, but there aren't enough highlights to keep ones interest. The actors who play the inmates take the material seriously and give it their all, but they're generally uninteresting protagonists and I found myself thoroughly bored by the halfway point (37 minutes). This is unfortunate because its clear that Higgins put a lot of time into the dialogue-driven script. Danielle Laws is ravishing as Helle, the killer blonde, but the film inexplicably doesnt take advantage of her presence. For a dynamic low-budget slasher that takes place in a dilapidated asylum and has great aesthetic value see Death Tunnel (2005) (see my review for details).

THE MOVIE RUNS about 76 minutes and was shot in Essex, England.

Part of a multi-pack. Not worth the time.

8201904,2,B000RO8UBK,"This film hardly meets the stardards for release. The direction and editing is quite amateurish at times. It's not scary and the death scenes are disappointing.
But the lead female is really hot, i'll give you that. Tough only in the beggining you get to see her naked (waist up only).",1260316800,,285,4.607843137254902
