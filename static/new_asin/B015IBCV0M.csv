Be warned, there are passwords on the disks and it will be very difficult for you to play these disks if you can not read and understand Japanese. They will not play on DVD players in north america unless you have it set to play japanese dvds. If you do go through the trouble to earn the passwords by defeating the puzzles and change the region code settings on your dvd player, you will be rewarded with hours upon hours of great entertainment from Ryoken, Nao, Daiuske, and ue-chang, There is a lot to take in here, a tremendous amount of video. Funny sad terrifying and rocking all in one box set! I recommend it",1468022400,,706,4.356060606060606
8733699,5,B015IBCV0M,"NEW MUSIC FROM MTH! Whats not to love? I, like others, am confused about the whole need for a password using weird symbols not found on a regular keyboard, but they were quite clear about it on their website when they advertised the album. The game and the blu ray are much easier to access if you can read and understand Japanese. My only complaint is that the CD seems to be quite short and would not stand alone as an album.",1454716800,,427,4.219512195121951
8733700,4,B015IBCV0M,"Not heard it but apparently it is password protected and you have to be able to understand to solve the puzzle to get the password. Even Japanese people have trouble with it. What a shame. Why did they do such a stupid thing?

Edit. Well, I had to buy it anyway, so I hope I can crack it! It all comes in a fancy box and you get an audio CD and various other discs.

Edit. I don't think I had to use the password. I'm on a Mac. Burned the Blu Ray a long time ago now so I'm going off memory. The DVDs don't need passwords.",1454716800,,522,3.824074074074074
