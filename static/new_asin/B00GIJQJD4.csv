8623561,1,B00GIJQJD4,"This DVD was a huge disappointment.  I expected something along the lines of Pacino's Looking For Richard that actually had insight into and  scenes from the play. I learned nothing new about Troilus.  The one good thing is that this production is only 52 minutes long.  Most of it was taken up showing the actors trying to read the translation of Shakespeare into Maori. You never get to hear Shakespeare's words.  When the documentary comes to the actual performance of the play at the Globe,  that only takes up 5 minutes - most of which the director spent cutting to the actors backstage relieved that they had struggled through it.
It also becomes obvious that Troilus and Cressida is a very poor choice for the Maoris.  T&C is a sophisticated, city play even through it takes place in Troy.  Macbeth or Henry VI, Part 3 would have been a more suitable vehicle for this rural culture.
I'm going to throw this DVD away.  I'm not bothering to donate it because I don't want another Shakespeare lover to be deceived by this work",1439856000,7,1030,4.615384615384615
