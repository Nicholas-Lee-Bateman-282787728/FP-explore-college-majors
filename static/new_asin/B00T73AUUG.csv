7002695,5,B00T73AUUG,This Season only has 13 episodes. That is why there are only 2 discs and is priced cheaper than the other episodes,1426896000,10,114,4.2272727272727275
7002696,5,B00T73AUUG,"Now doesn't Mr Ed look cool in those dark glasses..... kind of reminds me of The Fonz..... if you check the DVD cover of Happy Days - Season 6, you can see an eerie resemblance. Mr Ed's wisecracking comments and antics are a delight to watch, lots of horsing around... you don't see this 'brand' of humor nowadays.

Some Mr Ed Trivia:
When Mr. Ed was tired of working, he'd just walk off the set.
The character Mr. Ed originated in a series of magazine stories. Not only did the horse talk, he got drunk.
Mr. Ed's daily diet was twenty pounds of hay, washed down with a gallon of sweet tea.
Mr. Ed's voice was a closely guarded secret, but it was actually Allan Lane, a former cowboy star.

The following is the episode guide for season 6, originally aired in 1965-66.

1 - Ed the Counterspy  (Mike Mazurki, Jaqueline Beer))
Ed and Wilbur team up to catch a spy.
2 - Ed a Go-Go  ( Johnny Crawford, Frank Wilcox)
The neighbor's teenage son is playing loud rock 'n' roll records late at night, and it's preventing a good night's sleep for Wilbur and Carol.
3 - Coldfinger  ( Henry Brandon)
Having previously been successful in helping to apprehend Russian spies possessing stolen microfilm, Wilbur and Ed are now after them for trying to sell an American military secret.
4 - Spies Strike Back  ( Henry Brandon)
The Russian spies have stolen an unknown American secret formula, so SIA (Secret Intelligence Agency) enlists Wilbur to find out which one. Mister Ed joins him, and Carol is left wondering where Wilbur is at all hours of the night.
5 - Love and the Single Horse ( Irene Ryan as Granny Clampett)
Mister Ed writes a hot and spicy autobiography.
6 - Anybody Got a Zebra? (Victor French)
The SIA (Secret Intelligence Agency) once again enlists Wilbur to figure out how secret papers are being stolen out of filing cabinets, which are right under the agent's noses. In order to help solve the case, Mister Ed needs to speak with a monkey, so he uses a zebra as a translator.
7 - TV or Not TV
Mister Ed wins a late model color TV, and he demands that Wilbur put it in the barn.
8 - The Horse and the Pussycat
Much to Ed's dismay, Carol and Wilbur agree to cat-sit for a friend who is vacationing in Hawaii for an entire week.
9 - Don't Skin That Bear ( Bobby Diamond )
Ed wants Wilbur to get rid of a bearskin rug that was given to Carol and him by her father.
10 - Ed the Bridegroom ( John Qualen, Les Tremain)
Ed wants Wilbur to help him get married to another horse, and Carol's father thinks that Wilbur is in need of mental help.
11 - Ed and the Motorcycle (Bobby Diamond)
Ed refuses to continue to wear a saddle and he demands that Wilbur ride him bareback from now on, so Wilbur gets a motorcycle to retaliate.
12 - Cherokee Ed
When Ed discovers that he is of Cherokee descent, he refuses to participate in the Pioneer Parade. Unfortunately for Wilbur, he has already promised Carol's Dad that Ed would do it as a favor for him.
13 - Ed Goes to College
Mister Ed goes to school so he can become a veterinarian.",1424044800,31,3021,4.326855123674911
7002697,5,B00T73AUUG,"One of the great shows of years past!  Just good clean comedy and no violence and foul language.  I just wish that the producers of ""Mister Ed"" would have let Ed talk to Carol and the next door neighbors in the very last episode!  Would have been fun to see their reactions, and for them to realize the source of Wilbur's sometimes crazy behavior!  I'm glad to be able to watch Mister Ed on DVD as it takes me back to a bygone era.",1468108800,,431,4.095238095238095

7002716,5,B00T73AUUG,"Thank you for your reviews to those who posted them on AMAZON regarding Mister ED The FINAL season (6)....I was well aware that SEASON 6 was only had 1/2 a seasons amount of episodes, IF THAT and I have seen them before SO I will have FAITH in this FINAL DVD set and give it 5 STARS ahead of time!  For those reading, I have all of the FIRST FIVE SEASONS when they were sold separately/individutally :) ...and I loved / LOVE them.  I realize the complete series DVD set has all 6 seasons but I had FAITH that Wilbur would come out of the barn with a SEASON 6 sold separately/individually to honor their loyal fans who purchased Seasons 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 separately and did not want to spend/afford and entire COMPLETE set.  Touche Wilbur, Carol & Mister ED!  THOUGH I will mention for those who do not know...that the COMPLETE SET, as far as I know the first season is UNCUT episodes whereas the first season sold originally/separately/individually either the first intro PILOT episode is CUT shorter as it was in syndication OR IN FACT ALL the first season episodes ARE (?) CUT as they were in syndication.  I can't be certain of that.  Either way, I'm buying the 6th season by itself as, as much as I ADORE the Posts & their talking wise-cracking horse....the sun will come up for me tomorrow without perhaps 6 minutes (if NOT possibly 10 minutes???) cut from the first episode and/or all the first season episodes!  Eager to purchase Season 6, get in to the hay and munch some carrots as I watch it....horsey style! ;)  WHOAaaaaaaa WILBUR!!!! :O  (GOD BLESS CAROL for never realizing her husband had another NAG in his life behind her back! :)  GREAT SERIES! GREAT ACTORS! GREAT PRODUCTION VALUES! GORGEOUS CLOTHING! FABULOUS SETS!  Thank you (!) Allan Young! (You too Mister ED!)!",1431216000,7,1781,4.551724137931035
