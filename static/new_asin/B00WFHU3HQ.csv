7131659,5,B00WFHU3HQ,Atom The Amazing Zombie Killer is easily one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Such a classic! Can't wait to watch it again and again. Rock and Bowl!!,1441238400,2,164,4.5

7131661,4,B00WFHU3HQ,"Atom is a throwback to when low budget horror was both fun and extreme. This film felt like old school Peter Jackson in a new school mentality. Great film and if you are a horror fan, this is a must buy

7131663,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"Totally worth your time. Just make sure you've eaten your grilled cheese sandwich BEFORE watching. I learned this lesson the hard way. These guys spent 6 years writing, shooting, and editing this beast of a film. You can give this 180 minutes of your valuable time, if only for the amazing practical effects and sweet soundtrack.

7131665,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"This is really great movie. It takes the zombie genre and puts a new and cool take on it. You can tell that the filmmakers were passionate about this movie. It catches you right from the beginning with it's awesome theme song and continually draws you in more. It has some really cool zombie kills and two of the best I have ever seen. Not only does it have zombies it also has some cool bowling scenes in it. If you love movies like ""Chillerama"" you will definitely enjoy the hell out of this movie. If you love zombie movies this one you must see again and again. I instantly loved this movie and it was really cool seeing it. Now go see it.",1440633600,3,643,4.193548387096774
7131666,5,B00WFHU3HQ,Spoiler: This movie is so bad that it completely rocks! It knows that it is bad and makes use of that fact to insert humor that just wouldn't work in most movies. See this movie and be forever changedor something.,1440547200,3,213,4.35

7131671,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"Though I've never been a huge fan of Troma Entertainment films, I've always respected their quirky gore filled humor and their over the top slapstick style, For me TROMA films reminded me of a crazy combination of Looney Tunes and Full Moon Pictures. While I could handle these types of films in small doses, they aren't necessarily my favorite kind of B Movies, Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer is a fun film if you keep in mind of what you are signing up for. Some parts had me laughing a lot, the humor was often random and silly. If you aren't uptight about gory horror films, this might be a enjoyable movie to watch with some close friends.

Before I wrap this up I want to admit that I find Lloyd Kaufman to be absolutely amazing. He always makes me laugh in everything he is in. His appearance in Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer was the best part of the film. I just find him to be incredibly charming and he seems like one of the coolest guys in the horror industry. He is definitely on my top five list of the people I would like to meet.",1471132800,7,1045,4.277777777777778

7131675,3,B00WFHU3HQ,"Interesting little film with hits and misses.  I think for a low budget horror movie it did entertain,  I can honestly say it was like nothing Ive ever seen before.  Basically a knock on the head makes bowling Atom think that everyone is a zombie and he takes to the streets on a killing spree.  It is new and unusual and I don't think had one real zombie in the movie but I didn't even think about that til later I was anything but bored.",1466294400,,439,4.129411764705883

7131677,1,B00WFHU3HQ,"Just a really bad film.  Bad acting.  The lines were delivered one after the other like the actors were tired of waiting for each other to speak.  Bad effects.  The one guy's head looked like a Mardis Gras parade gone horribly wrong.  Bad casting.  The cops looked like highschool kids on a bender.  This film tried desperately to copy the success of Troma flicks.  But failed, atleast Troma movies are funny and while horrible have some entertainment value.  The only thing funny about this film was the fact I watched it to the end.  Good luck.",1464566400,,546,4.59375

7131684,4,B00WFHU3HQ,"Saw the premiere of this at the Starfest convention in Denver a few years ago, and I was the first ever video review of the film(also on the extras on this release). Great to see a national release of this fun romp. The filmmakers Richard and Zack are Troma Alumni and their experience reflects in this film.  It's a fun and cheesy and a great indie film. Don't miss this.",1458345600,,372,4.314285714285714
7131685,5,B00WFHU3HQ,One of the funniest and original takes on the zombie comedy genre. All the fun of a Troma style classic! The best bowling movie since Kingpin and the best brain injury movie since Regarding Henry!  A must see for any midnight movie marathon or horror fan!,1458345600,,255,4.543478260869565
7131686,2,B00WFHU3HQ,"If only it didn't have a crappy story, crappy dialog, crappy acting, crappy F/X, a bunch of pimple faced kids in it, I would have given it 3 stars.

It has a bit of cheesy movie likability, but even that is ruined by multiple racist and sexist moments, and a non stop flood of fart noises. If it had been made in the 70's before people knew better it would be horrible, but there is no excuse for that now.",1458259200,,406,4.075
7131687,2,B00WFHU3HQ,"I really wanted to like this movie. I saw the music video from The Radioactive Chicken Heads and it piqued my interest. The concept it pretty good on its own, but the execution was cringe inducing. The acting was mediocre at best. It also doesn't help that the characters were pretty awful. At least the effects weren't the worst I've seen and the cameo by Lloyd Kaufman was nice.",1457222400,,380,4.521739130434782
7131688,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"Love this movie!  With all the zombie movies out there this one is really clever.  It's got all the fun gags you come to know and love from most B-horror films, but it's got that extra something extra making it so much fun to watch!  Get it.  Watch it. Get disgusted by it.",1457049600,,273,4.09433962264151

7131692,1,B00WFHU3HQ,"Terrible Terrible Terrible. There is a term people like to use for movies like Troll 2 and The Room, that being ""So bad it's good"", but that was an unintentional outcome by the movie makers. When people set out to make a so bad it's good movie, it will end up just being plain bad 99% of the time and this is no exception. It tries way to hard and fails in all regards. Don't waste your time.

By the way, this movie is nothing like the description and cover would imply.",1453075200,,471,4.119565217391305

7131700,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"What a great B movie.  I loved this one.  It put a smile on my face and any movie that can do that is OK in my book.  Yes, it is definitely not for everyone but if you don't mind ultra low budget, schlocky, self aware, funny movies that you don't have to think too much about, then you may just like this one. I started not knowing anything about it and couldn't stop watching.  I felt like I could have made it myself with some good friends and a camera and that's not a negative thing.  It's great because that's the kind of thing that makes it fun, like knowing that these guys had an idea and they actually went all the way with it and had fun in the process.  I hope a lot of people get a chance to see it who would actually appreciate this kind of movie.  The funny thing is... I'm still thinking about it several days after watching and I keep telling people about the scenes.  That's just cool.",1447718400,3,902,4.0852272727272725
7131701,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"The concept is great!  I loved the premise of the movie and while I'm not much for zombie movies, this one had me laughing and enjoying the ""out of the box"" nature of the movie. This movie made me realize how crappy a lot of the Hollywood stuff is and how much talent there is doing lower budget movies. Buy the DVD, it's a great stocking stuffer!",1447286400,2,347,4.17910447761194
7131702,5,B00WFHU3HQ,"This movie is definitely one of my favorites. I watch many horror, gore, b-rated, etc. films and this one was one of the greatest. It has amazing gore and comedy scenes and it also has Lloyd Kaufman from Troma in it!!! Need I say any more??? I promise you it's well worth your time and money. If you are looking for a boring  mainstream and clich style movie, this isn't the one for you.

If you are looking for a high end horror flick this isn't it. This is a throw back to those great cult classic B horror flicks. It's filled with questionable acting and even more questionable effects. Down right knee slapping funny and awesome gross outs. Toss in a cameo from my favorite Babette Bombshell and I am sold.

Make a heap of popcorn, stock up on the Raisinettes, fill the fridge with adult beverages and invite some friends over to hoot, holler and toss popcorn at the screen.",1442793600,2,694,4.544
