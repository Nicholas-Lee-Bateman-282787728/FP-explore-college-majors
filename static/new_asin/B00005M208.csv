7945005,5,B00005M208,"If you're a Hopalong Cassidy fan, getting your hands on this seemingly rare treasure is wonderful. This DVD contains a pair of films from the start of the Hopalong Cassidy series. It was a little expensive compared to the initial release price, but considering its rarity, the price was worth it. I've seen it advertised for 5 times the price that I paid for it.",1307232000,,362,4.584615384615384
7945006,3,B00005M208,"He dresses all in black. He struts around with 2 pearl-handled Colt pistols. He doesn't drink. His horse can make breakfast. He's Hopalong Cassidy.  1935's hit ""Hopalong Cassidy Enters"" sparked the magic formula for veteran actor William Boyd and his long-running movie and television franchise. This double-feature DVD starts with 1936's ""Three on the Trail"", co-starring George  ""Gabby"" Hayes and one-time Broadway star Onslow Stevens as the corrupt saloon owner Pecos Kane. Stevens had an interesting Hollywood career. In 1932, he started in films as a leading man. He slipped to character parts,and became famous as mad Dr. Edleman in 1945's ""House of Dracula"". In later years, his career was adversely affected by alcohol. It is reported that his death in a convalescent home in 1977 was attributed to murder. The second movie, ""Hopalong Cassidy Returns"" is an exciting shoot-em-up. Villian Blackie Felton drags a wheelchaired cripple through town to his violent death. Hoppy swears revenge. Blackie is played by Stephen Morris, who once worked for Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. Later, he changed his name to Morris Ankrum, and appeared(often uncredited) in over 170 motion pictures. In the 1950's, Ankrum turned up consistently in low-budget monster movies. These 2 superior Cassidy episodes were filmed in the Alabama Hills, in Lone Pine, Cal., around Mt. Whitney, 400 miles north of Los Angeles. Other locations included Red Rock Canyon in the High Sierra Mountains. The DVD elements have been spruced up with digital audio and visual restoration. There's some sound drop-out, but the picture quality is amazing for 1936. William Boyd continued his very successful Hoppy films into the 1950's, ending with a TV series. He retired, but continued making live appearances for his legions of adoring young fans; almost up until his demise in 1972.",1026259200,17,1852,5.295918367346939
7945007,5,B00005M208,"Once again our silver-haired hero in black Hop-A-Long Cassidy, with the help of Johnny Nelson (Jimmy Ellison) and Windy Halliday (George ""Gabby"" Hayes), Hoppy's two trail wranglers try to feed hungry settlers during the great depression in Plainsville...Hoppy goes up against some tough polecats (Morris Ankrum) and it spells trouble...strong storyline with fast-paced action and a beautiful backdrop of Lone Pine, California...gives this film the wide open spaces with breathtaking moments.
William Boyd (Hoppy), ranked high on the list of ""Western Roundup"" heroes, riding his white steed Topper, with blazing pearl-handled six-guns, as the rustlers and outlaws reached for the sky.
Both features are top-notch film-making, outstanding directing from Nate Watt...Boyd gave his character life, his word was his bond...never quit on a friend in need and always give the other fellow an even break...this was the way of the early west...and this was the code he lived by, they'll never be another HOP-A-LONG CASSIDY!
