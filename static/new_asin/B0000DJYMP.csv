1925479,1,B0000DJYMP,"I guess that I realized it in the very beginning of the movie.  When Lance Henriksen is the star and there are no other recognizable names or faces, maybe that is a cue that you might want to see something else.  As a mystery, it does not work because what is going on becomes painfully clear pretty early in the movie.  I do not feel that it is fair to blame the actors, who incidentally do not distinguish themselves.  But, who could make something out of this simplistic yet muddled mess?  It would have been somewhat interesting if we could make some sense of each character's epiphanies, but they are so garbled and unclear that there is never any payoff.  And, on top of that, the ending (I shall not give it away) was contrived and trite.  An almost complete disappointment.",1091750400,2,781,4.49645390070922
1925480,2,B0000DJYMP,"THE INVITATION's premise is fairly simple:  Lance Henriksen stars as a man who invites eight of his friends to his remote island getaway.  In the spirit of TEN LITTLE INDIANS with somewhat of a twist, he informs them that he has been ""born again"" and also, by the way, he's poisoned each of them.  He will give them the antidote if they all confess to some hideous secret they all share that involves each other.  The script is so shoddily written, however, that it takes a long time to fully understand just what it is each of these people have done.  Also asks the question, who died and made Lance Henriksen God?  He says he's doing it for their own good, to allow them ""freedom in their lives"".  His method of freeing them however is ultimately cruel and sadistic; also the ending is predictable and the little dog is the clue to the esoteric climax.
An unusual premise given shoddy treatment.  Henriksen does fairly well, but the rest of the cast is only average at best.  Don't expect a horror movie, just a philosophical psychobabble.",1089590400,2,1041,4.583783783783784
1925481,3,B0000DJYMP,"Spoiler Alert if you hate spoilers, don't bother to read any further.
This movie was OK.  It wasn't all that good, but it wasn't terrible either.  It was predictable.  Throughout the film, I kept thinking ""there is no way this guy would bring his friends to the island and then poison them.  Just no way.  I bet he's given them something that mimics death, and they'll wake up and realize they've had a mind-blowing trip with insights into their lives"".  Yep, sure enough, that's what happens.  ""Even then, I kept thinking, ""he (Roland, Lance Henriksen's character) must be dying.  How else would he not be worrying about MASSIVE lawsuits?"".  Sure enough, he dies in the last scene, or at least is dying.  I watched it and don't hate it, it had some good scenes and I did sniffle a bit, but I don't particularly like it either.  Watch it on cable like I did.",1089072000,2,858,4.5064935064935066
1925482,1,B0000DJYMP,"This is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen.  I didn't like any of the characters and couldn't make myself care what happened to them.  It's hard to care about a bunch of adults who just sit around letting bad things happen like a bunch of ninnies.  I hated it, simply hated it.  I'm giving it one star because I think I should give the actors something for their efforts, but that is all.",1460419200,,395,4.226666666666667

1925486,5,B0000DJYMP,"It is one of those movies that has some original ideas that stir up some interest- but there are some things about it that are so amateurish, cheesy, and clumsy that for many viewers- it just won't deliver.
Personally, I love this movie, but I can't expect that everybody could.
Lance Henriksen fans will not be disappointed. This role suits him completely. The only bummer is that (except for Sarah-Jane Redmond) the actors really can't hold their own next to him, so the effect is sort of lopsided. One moment you're in the story, the next you've got Cornball City on the screen, and then you swing back to story again.

The writing is awful and Henriksen's Roland seems so incredibly unlikely, even with the back story. The compassion and hope for his friends clashes sharply with what he does to them. Henriksen pulls it off, though. Well, some of the ""dramatic effect"" camera work really seems to be *trying* to drop an egg on his performance, but that isn't what stays with you. And now I've come to the part that made me want to write this review: This movie stuck with me.
I saw it once about 6 years ago when I was home with the flu and it was free on cable. And I just never forgot it, and today it just still makes me think sometimes. So I just watched it again on Prime, and....

It's still corny.
I might have to buy it.

Roland is a memorable, disturbing, likable character. If you met someone in real life that was capable of doing what Roland does to his friends in this movie, then sorry- but human behavior says that he would never be so empathetic, and likely nothing about him would be genuine.
Roland is a total fantasy. A haunting thought, but a unicorn of a character. The rest of the film is trying so hard to grow up into a psychological thriller. And there is originality in the main concept. I feel like if it were in more capable hands, then it could be a really good film for everybody, not just Henriksen fans. (That's not a request to movie makers; Roland is solidly Henriksen for me.)
So my 5 stars are because of my experience was so enjoyable for me, even though I'm obviously qualifying that rating quite a bit.

I recommend trying out and deciding for yourself.",1457136000,,2197,4.430693069306931
1925487,5,B0000DJYMP,"The cover completely misrepresents this film. It's not horror, it's barely even a thriller. It's painfully cheesy, and incredibly overdone... and it's FANTASTIC! The emotionally-manipulative music, the half-baked philosophy, the corny dialogue, the unexplained plot points, and Lance Henriksen's joyfully smiley performance (you can tell he's having a lot of fun with this role) all combine to make this one of those films where you know it's not great, but you can't help but love it anyway. Words fail to truly describe just how spectacular this movie really is. Experience it for yourself.",1457136000,5,592,5.376344086021505

1925493,4,B0000DJYMP,"At first the plot seemed like Ten Little Indians depicted in several movies in earlier decades.  The last 15 minutes or so will very possibly change the way in which you look at your personal life and those of your surrounding friends and family.  It was such a life affirming message that after I watched it on Netflix, I ordered a copy for my personal library to circulate to my adult children and grandchildren.  It has the potential if a viewer has not become jaded by the vicissitudes of life to actually change your values and increase your happiness.  I do recommend it.",1353974400,2,577,4.572815533980583

I loved this movie...the acting is very good...The movie is uplifting and i got more from it than time wasted by viewing it. People don't believe everything a film company says about its own movies..It is not Horror..(I am a horror fan and i should know)..Yes, i think people should watch it....It might make a few think about the beauty of our lives and our world ... when the movie is over.

1925495,3,B0000DJYMP,"This movie started out with an intriguing concept: ""Fantasy Island""-type host Roland invites 6 friends to dinner, and then reveals he has poisoned them all, ""for their own good"" - because they will have to unburden themselves from the big lie upon which their lives are based, before he will give them the antidote.  He is giving them the chance to be ""born again,"" just as he was, when he had a similar experience in Peru.  He claims each person's secret is intertwined with everyone else's, as well as with his own life.  And here's where the premise falters.  For most of the guests, it's never entirely clear what their ""secret"" is, and even less clear how it ties in to everyone else's.  Yes, there are hints of interconnections, but it could have been crafted much more expertly.  I can't help but wonder if a great deal of this movie remained on the editing room floor - or was it really written this badly?  It could have been great; as it was, it was merely okay, and somewhat disappointing, although it did have a satisfactory conclusion.  Ironically the biggest ""secret"" of all ended up being Roland's, which was a nice twist.  I'll give the movie 3 stars for great performances and a good premise, but can't rate it any higher than that.",1311811200,2,1249,4.59009009009009
1925496,5,B0000DJYMP,"The only negative associated with the film may be that it is put out as horror while it is more of an uplifting film(though at it's times very twisted).
Yes, Lance poisons his friends and things get very odd and at times very twisted but he is trying to help them let go of something terrible they have done or feel they have done wrong - to leave them with a sense of peace and relief - as he felt after ingesting the poison.
Whomever said the acting is not well done is very badly mistaken. Lance's performance and several other actors were wonderful.
I have watched it several times and I recommend the film.

Addendum: It does have a bit of a religious tone to it but coming from a non-religious person, it really makes little difference as to whether the film is enjoyable.",1288396800,5,778,4.36551724137931
1925497,2,B0000DJYMP,"Let me start off by saying I like Lance Henriksen as an Actor, I like his work I don't care for this movie. It's pretty Obvious from the start, and I hate the ending. It is neither Much of a Mystery nor much Scary nor entertaining.",1284768000,2,231,4.043478260869565

1925499,5,B0000DJYMP,"A psycho who thinks and cuts through the air with an acute zen accuracy finds enlightenment from a Near Death Experience and poisons a houseful of his guests so that they can share in the vision of being peace as well.  This is absolutely the funniest movie that I have seen since Dumb & Dumber, however, if you yourself have never had an NDE or an OBE, more than likely you won't be able to capture the hilarity.  In my opinion this movie shows how insane we must seem to the atheists around us.  5 stars, don't miss this one.",1232755200,,527,4.25
1925500,1,B0000DJYMP,"You gotta be kidding.  I just WASTED 2 hours watching this dreck.  This movie is a bore, and the main character is supposed to be some kind of guru who has found all the answers?  It is a muddled mess, and never fleshes any of the characters out (you never really find out what their secrets are except in bits and pieces).  I immediately rated the movie ""HATED IT"" on Netflix.  This movie tries to be everything it is not.  And what it is is Terrible.",1225411200,,452,4.1976744186046515
1925501,3,B0000DJYMP,"An author, after coming back from a sabbatical, invites six of his friends (three men, three women) to his island paradise. The only way on and off the island is by boat. During dinner he tells them of his intimate travels to Africa and Peru.

He went on sabbatical because he had recently lost the love of his life and had become thoroughly depressed. He wore his depression on his face but would not share it. In an effort to release his pain a shaman he meets on a mountain top poisons him to help him release his pain. In his mind he died up on that mountain and was reborn.

When his guests start to become shaky and nauseous they realize their host has poisoned them as well. This does not have the desired effect he expected, especially after one of them drops to the ground a few minutes later with no pulse. Hysterical anger ensues.

I really enjoyed the movie and came upon it immediately from a comedic perspective rather than a psychological horror one. I also knew it would be a B-movie. Lance Henrikson played the lead character (although you don't see him for the first 10-15 minutes) and had me in stitches with his quirky looks of disbelief and knowing smiles.

Some of the supportive actors were a bit stereotypical and over the top. In the beginning Lance had said their secrets affected everyone else at the table but I didn't see a complete weave with everyone. Some scenes were definitely better than other ones and it was predictable. If you can catch it on tv, rent it or find it in the discount bin go for it. It is comical.",1151539200,4,1549,4.424561403508772
