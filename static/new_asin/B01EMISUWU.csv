7738812,5,B01EMISUWU,They did it again! Owlegories Vol. 3 brings back the Owl gang to learn more lessons. And your kids will laugh the entire time they are learning. The characters are so funny and the writing is superb. What a blessing to have a worry free source of entertainment. Your kids will be begging you to watch this series and you will be happy to oblige. Can't wait for the next installment from this very talented group of writers and animators.,1475366400,,437,4.475
7738813,4,B01EMISUWU,"My 3YO and 1YO grandchildren love the Owlegories series and always ask to view them when they visit. The only slight negative is that each story concludes with a biblical message from various pastors. I am never averse to a clear biblical message. However, on this case, they are not age appropriate for the cartoon audience, and the children get squirmy. For future volumes, I recommend having a completely separate chapter for the pastors' messages so that older children and parents can watch those separately. That being said, don't let that minor detail keep you from purchasing Owlegories! Great job!",1473292800,3,606,5.07

About the video (from the publisher)
You can tell a lot about an artist by what he creates. That is the theme behind Owlegories, the animated series. Owlegories teaches kids about God through the amazing things found in nature and revealed in Gods word.

The banner verse for Owlegories is Psalm 19:1-4:  ""The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.
I received Volume 3 from Fish Flix.  This Volume included
3 separate stories/episodes.

The Fire (from the publisher) episode 1. . .The Professor sends the owls to an ancient refinery to learn about pure gold and discover three ways God is like fire. Recap presented by Ben Stuart, the Executive Director of Breakaway Ministries. The KEY VERSE is Hebrews 12:28-29!

What I thought--I  enjoyed this episode.  I thought it was interesting and cool that they brought science into the story.  Not only is the message about how God is like fire there is an underlying message of forgiveness.

The Duck (from the publisher) episode 2 . . . The class travels to the swampland to meet Professor Owlesters old college roommate, Duck Dynastys Si Robertson. They learn the importance of working together and discover three great gifts given to us all by God. Recap presented by Silas Uncle Si Robertson from Duck Dynasty. The KEY VERSE is 1 Peter 4:10

What I thought-- The Duck was my favorite episode of the three.  Mainly because Silas Robertson
was the voice of 'The Duck'.

The Seasons--(from the publisher) episode 3--Our young explorers go on a high-tech adventure through a souped-up seasonal simulator where they learn three things followers of Christ can learn from the seasons. Recap presented by celebrity photographer and entrepreneur Jeremy Cowart. The KEY VERSE is Ecclesiastes 3:1

This video collection is an excellent source for parents.  The storyline and the message in each episode is a great tool for sharing God's message with our little ones and is appropriate for a wide variety of age levels.

Our family enjoyed the episodes we received and give it
a 'Thumbs Up' and a 'High 5 Stars'

My thanks to FishFlix for providing me with a complimentary copy and a giveaway copy.",1465948800,2,2469,4.821852731591449
7738816,4,B01EMISUWU,"I was impressed with this video.  I was very particular about the videos my son could watch when he was little (I still am for that matter!)  This one would have qualified.

I'm so glad I was introduced to Owlegories.  These little owls and their professor owl are a cute cast that teach valuable lessons.  One thing in particular that I liked was that these episodes were not on typical ""bible stories"" we normally see on children's videos.  They are lessons about creation that teach about God.  After the segment with the owl, another segment is a couple of minutes long reviews what the owls learned. I liked the approach.

I think this is a great teaching tool for parents and see it being used in a church setting as well, like for a children's time or Sunday School class.  I liked the length of each episode and how each one had a theme for the owls to learn about.

You definitely need to check out Owlegories.
