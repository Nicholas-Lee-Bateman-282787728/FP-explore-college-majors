8700487,4,B00T5GVE5A,"Because of years of dismal American pop music I didn't think I'd ever get into pop music again until I've seen kpop concerts of girls generation (snsd) and apink. Hearing American pop music used to leave you in a good feeling mood, anything from Motown for instance. Please bring back quality songs like that. The only exception today is perhaps Bruno Mars. Anyway because of terrible American pop I've looked towards foreign groups and i never listened to the spice girls when they were popular and that's the reason I got this concert. I must say that although this concert is good, to me it doesn't come close to the performances of snsd and apink. These groups have superior singing, dancing along with catchy songs. If you never heard kpop I urge you to get or see girls generation 3rd concert from Japan or apink's 2nd and 3rd concert.  If you don't like kpop i can only believe it's because of the kpop you've heard so far. I truly believe snsd is one of the greatest girls groups ever assembled. The language barrier will be a non issue and will leave you with that good feeling.",1529884800,,1087,4.545918367346939
