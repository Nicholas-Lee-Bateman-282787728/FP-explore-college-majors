8677115,5,B00NB2AONM,"Through all of my QiGong practice, Dr. Yang's foremost expertise in White Crane spinal movements is one of the deepest, and quite my most favorite aspect to train. Today's modern society we are keen to make certain ergonomic adjustments and can even be very particular about it. Yet how many days have passed since you haven't heard someone say something about a little tweek with their back, or forbid it be something more than that. Anyone can learn the Essence and practise of White Crane from Dr.  Yang's pragmatic methods and easy to follow organization of knowledge. We are truly lucky to have this knowledge passed down and now preserved. This helped me through serious back pain. I've passed along what I've learned from him to various soccer teams for their warm ups (as a special guest). I hope the help i have found from this information will prompt the 5 stars this work deserves and benefit your life behind what you may think possible. ( This includes my most favorite book of Dr. Yang's and possibly of all time due to its lasting impact in my life.)",1412553600,,1065,4.664893617021277
