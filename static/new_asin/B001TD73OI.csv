3788775,1,B001TD73OI,Very disappointing movie.  It's painfully slow and very boring.  It just doesn't have the same magic as the beloved Anne of Avonlea/Green Gables.  I think Sullivan should have stopped while they were ahead.  The storyline is simply not credible and poor LM Montgomery must be turning over in her grave ...,1255564800,18,305,4.921568627450981
3788776,1,B001TD73OI,"I gave this a chance, and by that I mean I watched it before writing this review. For the record, I loved the first two Sullivan Anne adaptations. The first installment was truly magical and I return to it frequently; the beginning strain of music is always enough to make me smile. The second installment (The Sequel) wasn't quite as true to the books given the challenging task of condensing ""Anne of Avonlea"", ""Anne of the Islands"" and ""Anne of Windy Poplars"" into one film (the last a charming but largely uneventful series of letters from Anne to Gil in the three years between their engagement and marriage), but I consider it a worthy adaptation in that it retains the mood, magic, and characterizations of the first film and source material (though I did miss seeing Anne and Gil in college, the ensuing drama with Roy and Christine, Patty's Place, and all the additional very memorable characters). To be fair, it would have to be a television series to remain entirely true to the books.

With regard to this fourth installment...first of all, whose bright idea was it to kill off Gilbert Blythe?! That's just WRONG. That being said, there's nothing particularly awful about this film (great scenery, solid acting), though the story is convoluted and jumps around a bit much for my taste...so long as you can get over the glaring omission of the title character herself. I don't blame Sullivan for wanting to return to magical Avonlea, but he really should've changed the names and called the film something else entirely. Even ""The Continuing Story"" (Part 3) was tolerable and that was only because Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie returned as Anne and Gil (their reunion scene in war-torn Europe was nearly enough to make me forgive the film's deviation from the books). If they wanted to continue the thread from Part 3, they would've been better off with a loose adaptation of ""Rilla of Ingleside"", the final book of the Anne stories which focuses on her children.

My single biggest problem with this story is that it re-writes history: Anne Shirley is an ORPHAN, it's a fact that shapes her indelibly. Her parents died of fever when she was a baby and she later revisits their old home (in Anne of the Islands). Anne has no memory of her parents though she loves them dearly and subsequently names two of her children after them (Walther Cuthbert and Bertha Marilla Blythe if memory serves). She does not, as this film suggests, make up the story that she is an orphan (Walter Shirley did not indirectly kill his wife in a wagon accident and become a guilt-ridden absentee father). Anne was imaginative, yes, but she was not a liar. It's also out of character and very difficult to believe that Marilla Cuthbert would ever hide Walter Shirley's letters from Anne. As it is, this installment is Anne fan fiction minus Anne and minus the magic. Perhaps someone with lesser attachment to L.M. Montgomery's Anne Shirley Blythe can appreciate ""A New Beginning"". Unfortunately, I could not.

BTW, this film is avalaible on Netflix. I did not purchase it.",1255478400,299,3066,4.803030303030303
3788777,1,B001TD73OI,"I can't believe the price of this DVD.Amazon mostly has the best price but in this case it is actually cheaper to buy it directerly from Sullivan entertainment's website. It is over $10.00 less in price.

I have seen a clip of this movie and it is so wrong,EVERYTHING has been turned around making all other Anne of Green Gables movies into lies and ruining what the original writter wrote. I love Anne of Green Gables and Sullivan Entertainment, but this just is wrong. So I will probably NEVER look at this movie.",1253664000,16,515,4.537634408602151
3788778,1,B001TD73OI,"I love Anne of Green Gables.  I've read every book written by L.M. Montgomery, practically every book about L.M. Montgomery and I've seen a number of adaptations of Anne in various forms from plays to movies.  This movie has nothing to do with Anne of Green Gables or L.M. Montgomery.  When are the producers going to stop trying to shoehorn their own ideas for characters and plot into the Green Gables name.  This isn't a horrible movie but it isn't Anne of Green Gables.  Anne is an orphan that is at the very foundation of who she is as a character.  Anne Shirley develops her imagination to deal with the often harsh conditions she has had to endure and she learns to thrive when she is placed in a loving environment.  This movie dismisses all of that and creates something that is contrary to the spirit of Anne of Green Gables.  A note to the producers, I'm not sure if you know this but L.M. Montgomery wrote a total of 8 books related directly to Anne and they were all successes and beautifully written books with endearing characters and sharp, heart felt plots, you should have used her works to create your films.  You certainly didn't improve upon them.  Rachel Lynde would definitely not approve.",1248998400,247,1212,4.595348837209302

When it says a new beginning it means just that. It's not about starting over. It's a new version of the backstory. It has a number of incidents from the later stories as if they happened prior to Anne's move to Green Gables. It makes Marilla and Anne seem less honest than they are generally portrayed.",1414972800,,495,4.625

I gave it a chance only because the stories are so dear to my heart and was left disgusted. There is no life in it - it does not come alive on your screen - you are not pulled in to it as you are with the classic movies. The lead actors are not suited even slightly to the roles, I felt nothing for any of them. Even the filming itself seemed rushed and not thought out.

The actors were all top caliber and the story was great.  I'm glad they made this movie to close the loop and finish Anne's story.

PLEASE don't listen to the negative reviews.  Enjoy it for what it is, and don't compare it to a movie that was made over 20 years ago.

3788815,3,B001TD73OI,"I really enjoy the Anne of Green Gables first two films. The third installment was not bad, despite it was not based on the books. The fourth installment (in my opinion) wasn't a good or a bad film. There was a lot of great talent from legends like Shirley Maclaine. No one can every replace Megan Follows as Anne Shirley. Like many of the reviews I have read, I was also disappointed that the character of Gilbert Blythe was killed off. The film had a lot of holes in its plots, and it did not have the magic like the first two films. However, I really enjoy the music. It is not the best of the Anne of Green Gables installments, but I think it is still good to watch.

I was surprised and excited when I learned they had created a new movie and wondered why I hadn't heard of it sooner. After watching the movie I understood why this movie wasn't widely broadcasted. While the acting was good and the image resolution was great it couldn't make up for the awful story line that had nothing to do with the original 'Anne of Green Gables' story line or time line.  They killed off a beloved character, Gilbert Blythe and turned Anne in to a liar and basically ripped apart the foundation of her history who made her who she was. Anne and Gilbert sadly aren't the only characters they destroyed in this film.
If this film wasn't associated with the 'Anne of Green Gables' series I could have liked this movie more. They totally failed at capturing the essence of this magical series which still has a lot of unused potential.",1370995200,2,944,4.52046783625731

3788842,4,B001TD73OI,"Let me start off by saying that I avoided this film for years. I read countless reviews saying how terrible it was and let other peoples opinions of this film put me off from it. The general outline of the story seemed very unappealing to me (I mean Gilbert dead? SERIOUSLY!!!!). I liked the first three films but had no interest in a film with no Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie, or any of the other actors that I knew or loved.

Since the end of Road to Avonlea it seems as though Kevin Sullivan has taken some very strong artistic liberties with regards to Anne of Green Gables. The entire third film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Of-Green-Gables-The-Continuing-Story/dp/B00005Y7AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Of Green Gables - The Continuing Story</a>&nbsp;was a original story that I honestly largely enjoyed, while others found it to be complete blasphemy. The fact of the matter was that Montgomery's works while excellent books did not translate to film very well at all, so these original films all be them not true to the story were the natural direction for Sullivan's story to take.

Well FINALLY I purchased the film in the Anne of Green Gables remastered box set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables-Remastered-Complete-Coll/dp/B006ZUMNGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables-Remastered Complete Coll</a>and I must say, I was very mad that I had not watched this film sooner. I found it largely enjoyable and had MANY throw backs to the previous films that honestly thrilled me.

The bulk of the story is that Anne now in her late 50's is involved in writing a play that is to be performed at the White Sands (yes apparently they put plays on there now)! While writing the play she goes back to Green Gables to write. We learn a couple of things during the first few minutes of the film, Anne's son Dominic from Anne 3 is missing in action, and her beloved Husband Gilbert has died. THIS WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT PILL TO SWALLOW AND IS MY MAIN REASON FOR GIVING THIS FILM 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5!! WHY POINTLESSLY KILL OFF GILBERT????

Any way sorry....We learn that Diana's family has been staying at Green Gables for the last 30 years and while packing to move out Dina's daughter discovers some of Marilla's old letters. Among these is a letter that was apparently sent to Green Gables from Anne's father....I know what your thinking...Anne's father is dead...Well not exactly in Sullivan's interpretation. And score bonus points for us getting to see Colleen Dewhurst in a flashback ;)

This sets in to advance a series of flashbacks of Anne's early years before green gables. Some of these flashbacks pull from the first novel like her time with the Thomas's. The largely original story is very disturbing and sometimes lighthearted. It tells Anne's story from the time of her mother's death up to the beginning of the first film when she's dropped off to live with the Hammond's.

The film features numerous shout-outs to previous films and other gems, like seeing Diana and Anne's families. We finally see RILLA albeit briefly and also Hetty King and Rachael Lynde! They are in their 90's and still going strong. It was very heartwarming to see both of these characters back on film!

I must tell you that I really ultimately did enjoy this film. I wasn't expecting to at all. I sat down to watch it with the mindset of, ""OK, I've seen the rest so just knock this last one out and never watch it again."" But, the film made a believer out of me. I know that it's not completely according to the books, but Sullivan's explanation of Anne's psyche is believable. It's very easy to see how a little girl may not tell the truth of exactly what happened to her parents, especially if one considers the circumstances Sullivan puts before us in this film. That said, if your a Anne purest how can't deal with anything except Montgomery's written word, then I suggest you skip this film, but if your someone with enough ""scope for the imagination,"" to be able to consider a alternative point of view. I think that you will enjoy this film and all of the throwbacks and shout-outs that it delivers.",1363392000,5,4228,4.997159090909091

3788861,1,B001TD73OI,"After receiving this DVD as a gift from someone who knows how much I love the Anne series of books and Kevin Sullivan's series, I was very excited to watch it. I was even more excited when I saw that one of my favorite actresses, Shirley Maclaine had a major role in it. Anything that Shirley would do had to be good. Well, I was wrong. I sat through the first few minutes trying to figure out what was happening, then the realization hit, my Anne was being rewritten, redesigned, ruined. Even more frustrating was watching Shirley Maclaine be part of it. Didn't she read the script before agreeing to do this? My anger grew as I watched other loved characters being brought back for emotional effect, not because it was good for the story. Mrs. Hammond, Rachel Lynde, even a spliced piece of Marilla. I can't help but think that Colleen Dewhirst would have been appalled by this adaptation. I don't know this, but I imagine if they asked Megan Follows to return as Anne, she probably refused after reading this ridiculous script. I don't mind if writers ""borrow"" from other writers for effect when it improves their story, but the stolen scenes from Jane Eyre do nothing to make this story any better. If you take away the fact that this is supposed to be the back story of Anne Shirley and just look at it as a story, it's still so badly put together that it wouldn't make it without the backbone of Montgomery's characters. Ok, correction, even with Montgomery's characters, it didn't make it. Don't waste your money on this DVD. It's not worth it. Watch the original series again. It's definitely worth watching over and over again, but throw this one out. Sorry Shirley, I guess everyone is allowed one dud. I think I'll watch Steel Magnolias now, so I can put you back on the top of my favorite actresses list. :)",1348963200,18,1819,4.548780487804878
3788862,3,B001TD73OI,"Although a book purist, I can put up with different adaptations of my favorite books, i.e. 1990's movie versions of The Secret Garden and A Little Princess compared to the books their movie story lines were based on.  However, this movie isn't just a different adaptation, it's a whole other story altogether!  Granted, I was skeptical of the movie to begin with based on the preview such as an auburn, dark red haired-Anne rather than the dark orange hair I expected to see, her over dramatization, different twists on the back story we all know and love, but hoped to be proven wrong.  After all, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only got an OK from movie reviewers, but the audience loved the film.  While Hannah Endicott-Douglas's portrayal of Anne Shirley wasn't quite as over dramatic as I feared it would be and most of the other actors did a good job, considering the story they were following, Barbara Hershey's portrayal of the spirited Anne Shirley was only passable.  Although the acting, costumes and settings were excellent, they couldn't make up for the story line.  The story's main idea is that Anne Shirley made up stories to explain her unknown past.  While Anne was imaginative and spirited, she certainly wasn't a liar and she never lived in a wealthy mansion until she stayed with Diana's Aunt Josephine.  Furthermore, why would practical Marilla Cuthbert not have shown Anne her own parents letters when Anne came of age, even with the new idea of Marilla having possessed the letters to begin with (which she hadn't, since Anne found them while searching for knowledge about her parents when she was a grown woman).  When writing a new story based on beloved, classic characters, I expect the characters and their histories to at least be mostly consistent.  The movie would have been MUCH better off if it hadn't revolved around the well-known Anne books.",1346198400,2,1885,4.8625
3788863,1,B001TD73OI,"This movie is pathetic, not only does it completely change the very nature of anne, But it even has the nerve to steal plot points from other stories and claim them as there own.

For instance when Anne goes to live at the poor house the punishment scenes are copycats of Jane Eyre. The standing Anne on the stool and forbidding others to have any contact with her, the cutting of her hair claiming that her hair is the root of the rebellion in her, even the death of a friend in the asylum.

The plot suffers from fits and starts, from blunt plot devices to annoying just-so attitudes to what just happened?

The film poses as Anne remembering the good ole days... ie stuff that doesn't really happen in the books.  It's Anne of Green Gables meets Oliver Twist and its a mess.  The acting is fine, but the plot and scenes are tried and sometimes nonsensical making you scratch your head.",1337644800,3,614,4.536363636363636
3788866,1,B001TD73OI,"Absolutely dreadful in every possible way.

This film suggests that because of a childhood scandel involving Anne's parents, that Anne lied about being an orphan her entire life. It also suggests that Marilla kept a letter from Anne's father from her, which is something that Marilla would never, ever do.

Megan Follows isn't in it. Instead, we get Barbara Hershey doing her best zombified Katherine Hepburn imitation. She breathes no life whatsoever in the character. In the extras, she even admits that she'd never seen the other 3 ""Anne"" films before she began this role, because she wanted to bring her own approach to the character. I can respect that, but when you take over a coveted role, you seriously need to at least TRY to act like the previous actress who owned that character. Barbara Hershey didn't even try. I felt like I was watching some red-haired woman named Anne who wasn't Anne Shirley Blythe.

Rachel Lynde is in it for one second, looking all of 110 years old, and her only line is, ""Bye!"" Pathetic.

Why does Kevin Sullivan feel the need to rewrite the back story of one of the most popular and endearing literary characters of all time? Isn't that a bit egotistical?  I mean, while we're at it, let's screw with Tom Sawyer's back story, or let's add things to Anna Karenina's past history, as well.

I'm not opposed to fan fiction, nor am I opposed to creating your own story and using it in a film. However, if you insist on creating your own fan fiction in order to make a film, show some respect to the original source material, at least.

And how would a small female child work in a lumber mill back then? Seriously? No way.

And the little girl playing younger Anne was truly horrible. She portrayed Anne with no subtlety at all, as though she were a hyper little girl on a sugar rush in  need of Ritalin. Just awful.

What truly irked me is that ""Road to Avonlea"" is set in 1903-1912. In the ""Anne 4 Official Movie Companion"" book that I got (but gave to someone recently) Kevin Sullivan changed the timeframe to 1907-1914 in order to coincide with ""Anne 3"" and ""Anne 4."" This is bothersome because several ""Road to Avonlea"" episodes CLEARLY state the year. In one season 3 episode the year is stated as being 1906. But according to Sullivan, it was really 1910 by that point.  *scratches head*  Huh???

Also, the film seems rushed and hurried. The so-called ""resolution"" is rather abrupt. What was up with Amelia Thomas's sudden backstabbing? That came out of nowhere. And why?

And what's the point of recreating the Lily Maid scene and the Haunted Woods scene from the first film? Why was that necessary? It completely destroys the validity of those scenes in the first ""Anne"" film.

Also, when Anne first goes to Shirley Maclaine's lavish estate, she remarks at how wonderful it is. Well, in the first ""Anne"" film, when she goes to Aunt Josephone's lavish estate, she hints that she's never seen such luxury before. This is really inconsistent, and not well thought out at all. ""That's the one consolation about being poor,"" she tells Diana. ""You have to dream all this up.""

And HOW is Hepzibah still alive in the 1940's? She would be around 120 years old! Come on, Kevin Sullivan. Now that's just BAD!

Now for the positives:

The music is breathtaking. At least the film had beautiful music in its favor.

I looooove the opening image of the older Anne lounging by the sea in the chair outside the White Sands Hotel. Just ... BEAUTIFUL (even if it isn't Megan Follows, unfortunately). It really, really makes me want to be there. Of course, the scene is ruined by Anne's memories of a mother she told everyone had died when Anne was an infant. But I like to imagine that Anne is only daydreaming about what might have been had her mom survived.

As for as positives, that's about it. My main issue is that Anne lied, and is not an orphan. That's why I hate this film. The flashback of Marilla was VERY well done, but I still hate the fact that she kept it hidden from Anne.

No, no, no, no, no. Anne WAS an orphan. It completely shaped who she was.

Unacceptable. Kevin Sullivan clearly has George Lucas Disease.

I have my issues with ""Anne 3 (The Continuing Story),"" as well, but I'd rather watch that film a million times again before I sat through thirty minutes of this monstrosity ever again.",1326585600,13,4339,4.584734799482535

3788870,1,B001TD73OI,"I heard from my sister that this movie existed and after much consideration, I borrowed it from Netflix out of curiosity. I grew up watching the first two and have read a few books in the series. I tolerated the third installment because the major principal cast from the first two reprised their roles and it still had some spirit left over. This fourth installment should never have been made for so many reasons.

I do think Kevin Sullivan was trying to squeeze water out of a stone on this one. The story is completely out of left field, especially with the new subplot of her father actually being alive and absent. This so rubbed me the wrong way because a major theme of the first two is her need to connect with other people because of her orphan upbringing. Her orphan background makes her who she is in the first two. So, I didn't buy the subplot and accept it as part of her story.

I think Kevin Sullivan made a lot of plot of decisions because the principal cast didn't return. Killing off Gilbert Blythe was one of them. As I watched it, I noticed how big of a gaping hole there was without him there. While it is an Anne of Green Gables story, Gilbert Blythe is an indeliable part of the story. Without him, I don't see the point. Barbara Hershey is a decent actress but plays Anne as a flat and boring middle-aged woman who seems even soft-spoken. Anne is not flat, nor boring, and definitely not soft-spoken.

As a stand-alone, it drug on and I ended up turning it off. I could not not compare this movie to the first two and for that, I didn't have the heart to finish it. I refuse to accept this as a viable part of the series and wish it didn't exist. The first two were fine on its own; the third was an okay addition, but the fourth was absolutely and absurdly unnecessary.",1312934400,3,1795,4.320474777448071
3788891,3,B001TD73OI,"As with other reviewers, I too am a fan of Lucy Maud Montgomery and Anne of Green Gables/Avonlea.  So much so, my family and I have traveled to Prince Edward Island to experience the magic ourselves. Come to find out, we even stayed with distant relatives of Mrs. Montgomery.  The Island, for me, is just as magical as the movies and tv shows.  With this said, this is what I have to say.

What drew me to stay watching the movie was the above, my memories of being on Prince Edward Island, the beauty, and sense of immediate peace.  That this movie did accomplish.  I must admit I could only watch about an hour of this and I turned it off.  But of the hour I watched, there were parts I really liked.  I did like the attempt of going back and seeing her past before Marilla and Matthew.  It sort of emphasized her plight before hand.  I could see why she had to have an imagination to survive where she was.

But even then, I had problems.  As one reviewer said, it jumped around a lot sometimes which made it hard to figure out what was going on.  Second, currently, my youngest is 12 years old and is very bright.  He comes up with the ""darnest things"" that just make you wonder.  I looked it up to make sure I was right, but Anne was 11 years old when she was adopted.  That was on the hairy edge of being believable of knowing such kind of language and romantic type speech.  This Anne was even younger which, for me, made it hard to believe she would be able to speak like she did.  But the actress did a wonderful job with it.  She was great in my opinion.  Her performance is what kept me watching.

As I was talking to my oldest son, who is 25 and remembers our trips to PEI, I was reminded of a tv show who's fans objected to the new series for this next reason I object to some of what happened in this movie: Star Trek - Enterprise.  I was shocked that it was the same writer that wrote this movie as the others.  You can't go back and rewrite the things that are an central parts of the original storyline.  The most obvious is suddenly Anne had been with her parents until she was ""quite old"" so to speak.  Old enough to have a relationship with her mother which greatly affected her desires and dreams of the future.  To top it off, her father was not killed, in fact, her father was responsible for her mother's death.  In Mrs. Montgomery's story and the first 3 movies, she was orphaned (as in NO parents lived at all) at the age of 3 months!  It may have been possible to change this to what Mr. Sullivan did in this movie, but I don't feel it was done in a believable way or a way acceptable to the audience.  Perhaps it would have been accepted if this memory had come rushing back in a some what traumatic fashion.  Something traumatic in the past had to have happened for her to have forgotten a memory such as this.  Just an idea.

It seemed like, at times, this movie was somewhat a remake of the first movie.  Mrs. Thomas, her mother's friend, kept reminding me of Dianna Berry. Also, a lot of Anne's words seem identical to what they were in the first movie, not age appropriate.  We didn't see Anne grow into this imagination, it was like she was suddenly like this.

Perhaps I am too big of a Meghan Fellows fan, but it is too bad that she didn't play the older Anne.  I didn't see this actress as believable as Anne.  Even depressed, in the other movies, Anne had a spirit about her.  Gilbert's death was more depressing and sad than something that would make me not believe this movie.

This movie wasn't bad, as others said.  As a movie of it's own right, it was good, not great like the others, but good.  Perhaps this movie shouldn't have been an Anne of Green Gables movie.  I think it would have been interesting to have taken a look back at Anne's life before the Cuthberts more than we have seen.  But to rewrite history, especially in the fashion it was done, made it so some fans couldn't accept it.

Neither the ""Continuing Story"" nor ""A New Beginning"" have much of anything to do with the original ""Anne of Green Gables"" or ""Anne of Avonlea"" films that were so well-made. The characters may have the same names, but they are so changed as to be utterly unrecognizable.  If you enjoyed the first two films, you should definitely avoid these as the magic just isn't there. Read Lucy Montgomery's books instead.

Mr. Sullivan, why oh why did you not tell the Anne stories as Montgomery intended?  It's obvious from the quality of the sets, scenery and cinematography that you had the money to do it, and the first two Anne films you made show you have (or at least had) the talent. Montgomery's books would have made for wonderfully entertaining films and would certainly have brought you a better reputation - not to mention income - than you now have as the man who brought new life into Anne (with the first two films) and then ruined it (with the last two films). ""Jane of Lantern Hill"" was another excellent adaptation of a Montgomery book - so you knew what to do. Why you didn't do it is as baffling as it is disappointing.

The only good thing about the ""new beginning"" film was the remarkable Hannah Endicott-Douglas. Thankfully she is getting other roles since one bad film can often destroy careers before they even begin. As for the rest of the cast, I can only say that, as with the ""Continuing Story"" film, they do their best with the poor material they have to work with, but they - and we - deserve much better.

Her father killed her mother; he was still alive and never took responsibility for her. Screenwriter and director Kevin Sullivan's account of Anne's early life was on the order of a Dickens novel, in a disgusting poor house. It portrays the Canadian governmental welfare system of the era in a pretty bad light. Very dark. Not for young children. And hard to believe that Anne could pull out of this deep pit of human misery and have become the beloved, well-adjusted girl we have all come to love.

If you want a more believable and pleasing prequel, you might have to read it. I thought that ""Before Green Gables"" by Budge Wilson. was doable, although I will warn you that it is not perfect either.  At least Budge Wilson actually used ""Anne of Green Gables"" as a basis, fleshing out the details that are provided in Anne's account of herself.

If this were not proported to be an Anne movie, it would be an OK movie, I'd give it 2-3 stars then, although there are gaps in the plot and some of the story line jumped around a bit.  Anne is an orphan, not an abandoned daughter, which shapes her whole life.  Marilla would never have withheld a letter from Anne, she would have given it to her.  I am so glad I did not spend money on this film, my local public library got a copy of it.

The actress portraying young Anne does a very good job, as does Shirley MacClaine.",1260316800,7,765,4.093959731543624
3788932,1,B001TD73OI,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie! Not only is it disturbing, but it is not true to the Anne stories written by Montgomery. The story line just makes your head spin, and you keep waiting for things to be ""straightened out"".....but they never are. Not only does this story completely deviate from what Montgomery tells us of Anne's past (I suppose the writer of this film just took liberties, and used the Anne fame and the fame of his previous Anne movies, to get away with this writing).....but it even ruins the way you look at Anne. If THIS is what Anne was really like - I want no part of her!!! A very disturbed girl that manages to get away with incredible lies, and to use the lies to get the things she wants......this is a far cry from Montgomery's Anne. When this movie arrived, my whole family could not wait to start watching it - we settled in with popcorn, and prepared to enjoy the evening. Instead, we all sat painfully in stiffness throughout the entire movie - speechless - and hoping we were not seeing what we were - and not understanding what we were seeing.......and then we all left the room agitated, and with sick feelings in the pit of our stomachs ........PLEASE stay away from this movie!!! And at best, rent it if you must see it......but please review it before you let youngsters watch - it has little or no moral value lessons in it, and will leave you confused and angry......and could even convince young children to take up lying as a method of getting what they want - or as a means to drown theirselves in denial!!!  ""A New Beginning"" is an appropriate sub-title for this movie - Sullivan has completely given Anne a ""new"" beginning (she's teetering on the brink of insanity here folks).....and TOTALLY different from what Montgomery would have given her!!! The original three movies by Sullivan of Anne (Green Gables, Avonlea, Continuing Story) are wonderful six star films - beautifully done, with excellent acting, and heartwarming characters that make you want to live life to the fullest and believe in your dreams - watch them all! Even if they deviate from the books, they are still wonderful family viewing (even my husband enjoys them). But this movie is just terrible.......stay clear of ""A New Beginning""!!!!!",1260316800,11,2266,4.693467336683417

3788934,1,B001TD73OI,"I got this in  the mail a couple days ago. I am a big ""Anne of Green Gables"" fan and loving all eight books by L.M. Montgomery, plus reading ""Before Green Gables"" when it came out, I was hoping this would be a good tale of Anne's life before coming to Green Gables. I have to say I was rather disappointed! Not only did it not follow Anne's true childhood it kept going back and forth to much, when it should've just stayed with Anne's childhood and then showed when she was older.

  I also didn't like who  the actor they picked to play Anne's father and how they switched so much of the story of Anne's beginnings around. I gave it 1 star because I  thought Hannah Endicott-Douglas superbly splendid as the young Anne Shirley, but in no way shape or form should Barbara Hershey been allowed to play the older Anne. For one she looks nothing like her and two Megan Follows should've been brought back as  the older Anne. It just didn't feel like an Anne of Green Gables movie, but some other movie that is foreign to the world and spirit of ""Anne of Green Gables.""

  I watched this last night and being the Anne fan that I am I thought I would love it! But I  didn't enjoy it at all. It didn't stick faithful to Anne's story at all for that being an orphan and made her father live. I couldn't get that wonderful warm feeling like I got from reading the books and watching the other Anne movies. Barbara Hershey shouldn't have been chosen as the older Anne and the fact that(spoiler warning) they made  Gilbert die, Marilla have letters from Annes father hidden from her and that it jumped around quite a lot made it not feel like an ""Anne of Green Gables"" movie at all.

  They should've brought Megan Follows back as Anne,  and kept Gilbert Blythe alive!!! They shouldn't have rearranged Anne's story and made it look she told falsehoods about her pass. The ending should've been how with archival footage of Matthew picking Anne up from Bright River station, the ride to Green Gables and it being decided that Anne could stay at ""Green Gables."" I wish it would've followed L.M. Montgomerys original Anne's story or the prequel book to the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series ""Before Green Gables"" by Budge Wilson. I give it 1 out 5 stars, because I didn't like how the storyline wasn't Anne at all, but the one star is for Hannah Endicott-Douglas doing good as Anne Shirley when she felt like the spirit of Anne, but Megan Follows will always be the best as Anne.

  I do wish they would've made a better version and followed the true storyline of the tale of ""Anne Shirley."" I am glad I didn't buy  this movie at all, but rented because it would've been a waste of money! They really ruined what should've been a pleasant experience and treasure for us fans of Anne. What we're they thinking? I just wish it followed more of the novel ""Before Green Gables."" and had the arcival footage be when Anne first came to Bright River station, was picked up by Matthew and headed to ""Green Gables."" Thus  wasn't the case and I guess I will have to watch the original Anne movies from the 80's and I am  reading the books again and getting the full original story as it was attended.",1259884800,18,3174,4.398972602739726
3788935,1,B001TD73OI,"Toronto-based Sullivan Productions has made a livelihood from adaptations of Canadian author L. M. Montgomery's works for the past twenty-five years. Now, I think the production company has done fine work in the past; I absolutely loved Anne of Green Gables and the first sequel to that film, Anne of Avonlea. Likewise, I really enjoyed The Road to Avonlea, the television series that was set in Anne's world and which ran for seven seasons. However, in this latest film, Sullivan has gone to the well once too often.

My first very apt reaction, while watching this film, was ""Who wrote this garbage?"" The answer is, none other than Kevin Sullivan himself, which I find puzzling. I don't see how he can have produced and directed such very fine adaptations of some of Maud Montgomery's novels, and then utterly trashed Maud's legacy with nonsense like this. The film totally re-writes Anne's entire back-story, present in both the earlier films and the original series of books. Hmmm, turns out that Anne was not an orphan after all before she came to Green Gables---she had an entirely different life and set of adventures, complete with uncaring absentee father.

There's no point in my going on about the many things wrong with this film, I'm just so disgusted with it. Thing is, perhaps this could have been a decent story if they hadn't tried to shoehorn it into the Anne franchise. If this had been about a totally different girl, coming from a background of adversity, I may have dredged up some interest in the tale. But---not without a thorough re-write first. The plot had some major holes and never did play out in a satisfactory manner. The entire final quarter of the film only raised a whole host of questions; the inconsistency-ridden finale was most unsatisfying. None of it, in the end, made any sense.

Now, the film is beautifully shot, and has a pleasant background score---but that was not nearly enough to overcome the negatives. Far as I'm concerned, Sullivan has spit on Montgomery's legacy---and not only that, he is guilty of writing a lousy script. I think that any fan of the Anne stories is probably going to want to watch this just out of curiosity, but I cannot recommend it in any way. I'm glad this was a rental and I didn't waste my money on buying a copy; if I had, I could not have in good conscience tried to re-sell it; I would have just tossed it in the bin. Ugh.",1259452800,55,2403,4.67612293144208
3788936,1,B001TD73OI,"I absolutely love the Anne of Green Gables series, so when I saw that Kevin Sullivan had made a new movie I was excited, although extremely skeptical - especially with a new actress playing Anne. Despite my skepticism I sat down to watch the movie with an open mind.

I don't even know where to begin when describing how terrible this movie was. First of all Gilbert is dead and Anne's father is still alive, which totally ruins the whole premise of Anne being an orphan. The flashbacks to Anne's childhood drag on and on. Many of the scenes are reminiscent of scenes from the original Anne of Green Gables. Such as her never having eaten ice cream before, one dress is very reminiscent of her blue puff sleeve dress. The scene with her standing on a stool as punishment seems to have come directly from Jane Eyre if I am remembering correctly. There are also quite a few age discrepancies...the housekeeper Hepzibah should have been dead at the end of the movie by my calculations (if Anne's father was 82 Hepzibah would have been well over 100). Rachel Lynde and Hattie King are also still alive well into their nineties. Anne's dramatic speeches were over the top, and seemed like a repeat from the other movies. Personally I don't mind if a movie deviates from a book, as long as it retains the overall spirit and feeling of the book. But this atrocity has absolutely none of Anne's characteristic spunk and personality. As I watched I couldn't wait for an ending. The wait was almost unbearable, and I was sorely tempted to either fast forward or to not finish watching.

I'm going to try to forget watching this movie, because it ruins the whole story that Lucy Montgomery created.

One positive note, the girl who plays Anne as a young girl does a good job with the acting.",1258934400,28,1780,4.5736677115987465
3788937,1,B001TD73OI,"It is absolutely horrible that they made this movie the way they did.  It is a dishonor to the characters L.M. Montgomery made.  I agree that she would probably be horrified at this film. Making Anne not an orphan?  Killing of Gilbert?  Getting rid of some of her children?  I mean come on...do you have no sense of right and wrong?  The third movie at least still had Gilbert in it even if it did deviate from the books, but this is too much!",1258416000,29,443,4.214285714285714
3788938,1,B001TD73OI,"As Anne said in this movie ""Christopher Columbus!!!!!"" what happened to my favorite book? ...Is Kevin Sullivan going senile? suffering from dementia? Alzheimer? If so, I am truly sorry. If not, the man deserves to be flogged! What on God's Green earth was the man thinking about????????? Destroying the foundation of Anne... and messing up with strait as an arrow Marilla! Killing off Gilbert? and where are James, Walter, Shirley, Anne (aka Nan) and Diana (the twins) and Rilla? If you're going to give Anne and Gilbert children, could you at the very least give them THEIR children?

And not only that but STEALING 2 scenes from Jane Eyre? (I believe the 1944 version with Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine): The punishment of standing on a stool for hours? and the cutting of the hair?? Oh for Pete's sakes...

I borrowed this one through NetFlix, and after suffering through... took it OFF my wishlist. I'd rather remember the Road to Avonlea series and the first 2 Anne movies (Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst version)",1256947200,145,1019,4.884393063583815
3788939,1,B001TD73OI,"If I could give it no stars I would. This was so bad, LM Montgomery must be rolling over in her grave. Boring, cliched, ripped off the Anne books, but without grace or style. Heavy handed and smarmy. Was there a poor orphan cliche he didn't use? Oh wait, she didn't get pressed into the Navy, but that was it! The real Anne isn't perfect and so long suffering. I know because I've read the books! Too bad Sullivan can't be charged with something and barred from ever doing anything Green Gables related again. Sad, because he started out well. Not sure what happened, but it isn't pretty. Or entertaining.

I put the movie on as soon as I got home and settled in for an evening of fun...I wish I had not purchased or watched this very long, depressing and at times badly acted addition to one of my favorite stories of all time! In truth is, this movie almost ruins the whole thing for me and to find out it is fiction and does not remain true to Lucy's writings was a real surprise.  What were they thinking?

The little girl playing Anne was a very good little actress and was a close second to the original Megan Follows. Shirley MacLaine was well cast as well. Barbara Hershey should have stayed home for this one as she just did not have what it takes to carry the role(I believe it is the fault of poor story writing)  Sorry Barbara, loved you in Beaches though!!  :)
