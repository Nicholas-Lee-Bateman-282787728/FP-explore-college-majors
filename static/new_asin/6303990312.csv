7858294,5,6303990312,"?Wow! What else can I say?  This is probably the best movie since Shawshank Redemption or Backdraft and/or Contact starring Jodie Foster.  The cinematographics encapsulated me in my own bubble of sheer delight and misfortune.  I'm going through tough times and I think I've finally found a movie I can trust and sleep next to (unlike that [.......] of a woman known formally as 'Lisa').  ""G. Whilliker!""'s plot is as exciting as it is life-shattering.  One minute you are in love with the chemistry of the actors and then the next you are in a coked-out haze trying to grope your way to the nearest episcopal church to find cheap salvation.  The drunkards in the film reminded me of my own goof-ball, 3-Stooges-esque uncles who molested me after binge drinking themselves into a blacked-out stupper.  The ninety minutes of ""G. Whilliker!"" (what I now refer to as my ""Transformatorial Epiphany"") have transformatized me into a new and better person. Two high tens equals 23 stars for this fine American made piece of cinema!!!",1235088000,4,1025,4.890173410404624
