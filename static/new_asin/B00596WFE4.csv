4620564,2,B00596WFE4,"This movie lacked a good script, direction,and acting. There was way to much of Ray Liotta who is the main character in this movie. Ray Lotta usually plays a  secondary actor at this time in his career. He doesn't have the charisma or acting skills to be
the lead actor when you have a boring script. The script needed a script doctor to tweak it to make it more suspenseful and interesting. If you are looking for suspense
this movie is not for you.",1316736000,,450,4.357142857142857
4620565,3,B00596WFE4,"""Twelve years ago I dated Sarah for four months, the last time we had sex was right down there. That makes me a suspect."" After finding an old girlfriend murdered Detective Jack Verdon (Liotta) is suspended from the force. After more and more women from his past end up dead he starts his own investigation. This is a movie that really surprised me. I do like Liotta and Slater but lately their movies have not been that impressive to watch. This is a huge exception. While it had all the makings of a bad TV movie this became something more. I'm not saying this is amazing or anything new, it has the same plot of many of the CSI-type shows but seemed better then those to me. While this movie was not as tense as it wanted to be it still kept me watching and I enjoyed this very much. It may have been because of no expectations but I would recommend this. Overall, a very entertaining murder mystery movie that is better then expected. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't know if I will or not

4620566,3,B00596WFE4,"Yet another serial killer story. This one's a little over-the-top gross, and I was confused but I guess I'm just too dumb. I watched it twice and I still don't know how the culprit was finding these women who all slept with the main character. I love Ray Liotta so I gave it a shot but I'll be damned if he didn't seem to take EVERY role that came his way after a certain point like maybe 2000.
He is almost ALWAYS with a woman onscreen who doesn't match his attractiveness level at all (that's no exception here; the wife is blech and the police partner he slept with is nothing to look at. I will never understand this; I have not seen all his films but the only beautiful woman I've ever seen him kiss was Madeleine Stowe). People want to see someone that handsome with someone beautiful. Well, I do. Call me shallow. His women are homely. But anyway, yeah, I watched it twice and I'm frustrated that I don't understand it. If anyone wants to explain, PLEASE fill me in!

 I really think there was a time after, say, 2000 when he stopped turning anything down! And the result is not great.",1515369600,,1092,4.321951219512195

A sad and violent tale, the end credit music was a perfect match. I always notice excellent musical tracks to movies and this one was terrific. I noticed it was attributed to Pinar Toprak, a name I am not familiar with. But the track was soleful and touched a deep place within the soul. It featured choir music, like high pitched boys choir and strings, violins and possibly a cello. I bought the track on iTunes as I often do when I come across well done music. So, the movie is indeed entertaining and whoever Pinar Toprak is, my hat is off to you!",1495065600,,686,4.4015748031496065
4620572,4,B00596WFE4,"I find it very difficult to give reviews on movies, books, and cookbooks. Movies can be all over the map and so relative, with so many variables (as with books), that it is sometimes just not truly 'fair' to give a review. A person can watch the same movie 20 times over their lifetime and glean many different things from the same exact movie depending on where they are at 'at the moment'.
I just wanted a movie with an interesting story that would keep me entertained and on my toes that would satisfy, and this one did it - for today. It might not have worked for me at any other time. Who lknows?
Funny, I'm not a fan of Ray Liotta, but I actually liked him in this. I think I was more focused on what a nightmare this was for him and truly empathizing for what he was going through in this ordeal than I was at poking holes in the story; or in some of my societal pet peeves and concerns. There are plenty of opportunities and occasions for me to 'air' those.

4620617,4,B00596WFE4,"Decent movie--if not Academy Award caliber.  Best part of the movie is that it followed its own internal logic and each revelation made perfect sense.  I was even genuinely surprised at a few of the reveals--even as one of the character's said, ""It's right in front of you.""  I'm usually good at figuring these out and it still managed to keep me engaged and guessing, almost to the end.  The worst part of the movie was the soundtrack--sound levels were uneven and sometimes the dialogue didn't quite match up, but even that small distraction did little to detract from the film.  Good storytelling and decent acting are far more important and this movie delivered.  Not an action film, not quite a police procedural, it's a good-old fashioned detective story with very little on-screen violence and no gore, but given the rather graphic descriptions of the murders (these are sex crimes), not for the faint of heart (or children) either.

Some (religious) viewers may also object to the main subject matter--the killer's motive if you will, but I can't go into more detail without spoiling the plot.",1421280000,,1101,4.887096774193548

4620627,5,B00596WFE4,I picked this movie as my third choice mainly because of the actors and a story line that might work.  After reading some of these Amazon opinions I had second thoughts and appealed to the 4 and 5 stars to get me motivated.  The acting was surprisingly good for the 22 days necessary to film it.  What impacted me was the strange connection between Ray's character and the women.  He matter-of-factly thought nothing with sleeping with 100 women.  What's the problem?  Well as we all realize any human choice and action means consequences.  In this one case an unwanted baby is born and has a bizarre upbringing with no father.  A mentally disturbed human develops and targets his absentee father.  Yikes!  Reflecting on this art should make more males evaluate choices and their consequences.

However, since this is only a DVD format, and a relatively new release, I am actually violating one of my own rules this time to warn those who might be considering buying it.

After having anticipated its arrival greatly, and typically enjoying good murder mysteries, I found this one to be severe let down. It had potential but never seemed to ignite for me.

A sick premise doesn't offend me if it is well designed and amply terminated after its exposure. This plot did neither.

4620630,3,B00596WFE4,"A murderer is stalking the streets of a town in the Pacific Northwest. The women he's been killing have a distinct pattern to them and the clues he leaves behind don't let the police know who he is, but they do realize he is a twisted individual. Each victim has their wedding ring or a piece of jewelry inserted into their vaginal area.

Ray Liotta stars as Jack Vernon one of the detectives called in on the first case. Jack immediately removes himself from the start when he recognizes the first victim. It was a woman he dated some years back and the location of the body is where they had sex the first time. This moves him to the top of the suspect list.

Told to stay off the case he of course ignores those instructions and begins looking for clues. When a second body turns up, another woman from his past that Jack slept with, the FBI arrives in the form of agent Vuckovich (Christian Slater), a smart mouthed agent who rubs Jack the wrong way and is constantly being told to back off by Jack's boss Capt. Langley (Ving Rhames). Vuckovich demands that Jack give him a list of all the women he's slept with. The list of 100 names stuns him, but then Jack was free and single for years until he got married.

Jack's marriage is doing great. His wife Ana (Gisele Fraga) is a chef who adores her husband. And while a list of 100 women may stun some, she doesn't hold it against him realizing that this was before they were married. But something or someone seems to be missing.

As information comes in Jack is cleared of any involvement and instead of suspect officially begins investigating the culprit. Each murder involves one more of Jack's past conquests, each one leaves something else that should be a clue and each one offers a Bible passage that is intended to aid Jack in catching the killer.

The clock is ticking and more women are at risk. With each passing day another could fall victim to this killer and several do. Until Jack can face his past and discover how these clues come together the killer will carry on.

This movie, made on a small budget, does offer an interesting tale. An allegory for STDs? Perhaps but I doubt it. Instead we have a tale of a man who feels regret, who feels shame and who feels guilt about having people in his past hurt by someone in the present.

Liotta does a great job here as one would expect. In recent years, he's been tossed aside into the direct for DVD market, but that only works to help movies in that genre. Slater has also been relegated to that market and done fine as well. In this movie though he's pretty much wasted in a part that should have been bigger.

By the end of the film you'll discover who the killer is, be able to piece together the parts of the puzzle that led to him and find a conclusion that will surprise you. Who he is and how he got to be who he's become is interesting and better thought out than most made for DVD mysteries.

4620633,1,B00596WFE4,"Hollywood actor Michael Rodrick says he used his childhood experience speaking in tongues at a charismatic church to help prepare him for scenes as the serial killer, John Lee, in ""The River Murders,"" a movie that was released in 2011. Ray Liota stars in the movie as Jack Verdon, a homicide detective who investigates a series of murders. Other actors include Ving Rhames, Gisele Fraga, Melora Walters and Christian Slater, who plays a caustic FBI investigator. The movie was produced by Rich Cowan, Richard Salvatore, Daniel Toll and Steve Anderson. Anderson wrote the script for the movie and Cowan directed. Anderson's short film, ""Hearts of Stone,"" was the 1987 runner-up for an Academy Award and played at the Sundance Film Festival. He followed that by working with Oliver Stone on ""South Central,"" a gritty film about gangs in South Central Los Angeles. The film follows a few black men as they become involved in neighborhood gangs, crime, drugs, prison and shattered family life.

In ""The River Murders,"" detective Liota becomes the prime suspect when the FBI discovers that he has close personal ties to all the female murder victims. The plot follows Rodrick in his role as serial killer preying on women, all of whom have known Liota. In a youtube featurette, Cowan says Rodrick was one of 40 men who were called back to read with Liota. Cowan and Anderson are interviewed about the decision to cast Rodrick in the role. Cowan says they went through about 600 actors before deciding on Rodrick. ""From the moment he came in and read with Ray, we were convinced (Rodrick) was the guy,"" Cowan said.

Liota does a credible job in his role as a detective, but there are aspects of the movie treatment that are simply not believable. During the investigation, Liota's character reveals that he has had at least 100 sex partners, including another female detective that he is working with. He was married at the time of the affair with the detective, who is fairly attractive. The investigation creates turmoil at home with his wife, which is understandable. And it's certainly not unusual to see movies about serial killers. It seems to be a favorite both on TV and the big screen. What is not believable about the movie is that Liota's character has had 100 lovers, or had sex with at least 100 women. It's not that it's not impossible for any one person. It's that in real life, for a detective with the looks of Liota, it does not seem possible. Do women fall all over unknown men who are detectives who hang out at bars - those who look like Liota - a detective who seems sincere and genuinely concerned about his partner and others? No. It's not that A-list actors can't have sex with movie star groupies who fall all over them. It's that Liota is not playing an A-list actor. He is playing an ordinary police detective.

Rodrick says he studied documentaries on psychopaths and serial killers to help him with the role. ""You start to see a pattern, that they are master manipulators,"" he said. Rodick plays the seemingly sincere, but manipulative and deadly killer well. ""He (God) has a plan for you,"" Rodrick says in one scene before he kills one of the women. Rodrick reveals he (or his family) visited a few churches growing up in  New Jersey where the charismatic churches ""spoke in tongues."" ""I was very affected by that as a teenager,"" Rodrick says. He asked the director if he could use some of his ""speaking in tongues"" experiences or characterizations on the set to psych himself into his serial killer role. Rodrick is seen psyching himself for the scene with ""speaking in tongue"" jibberish.  He sits on top of his naked female victim with her hands tied to the bedpost. ""My brothers and my sisters all have died the sins of the father,"" he says in a menacing voice. She answers in moans, her mouth stuffed with a rag. Near the end of filming Cowan asks Rodrick to record his voice for a short end of movie narration: ""Remember me. My soul will live forever in your sinner's heart. I am the way. I am the truth. I am the light. I am the resurrection.""

For Christians, the scene may be disturbing since Rodick is paraphrasing John 14:6, a New Testament passage in the Bible: Thomas said to him, ""Lord, we don't know where you are going so how can we know the way?"" Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" This is a strange element in the movie: a serial killer who quotes parts of the Bible as part of his demented character. Did Anderson do research on serial killers and find that good number of them were demented Christians who quoted scripture? Or is this an attack on the Bible and Christianity by the writer? It may be a result of the Hollywood climate toward labeling Christians as extremists. Having worked with Oliver Stone, Anderson may be someone whose intent is to either provoke or marginalize Christians. Rodrick says he used documentaries and youtube to research serial killers.

Were a majority of them Bible quoting Christians? It's doubtful. The concept should have given at least some of the actors reason think twice about accepting the roles. Why would Liota give credibility to such a role and not think about the implications? Hollywood actors can be sympathetic toward any one role they are playing, essentially disguising any truly held beliefs so that they can keep working. They can also express approval of a film that they believe in. Some have worked on Christian films where the Christian theme is obvious. Joseph Fiennes was the main actor in a 2003 film on the life of Martin Luther. Is he known in Hollywood as a practicing Lutheran or a Christian? In a tough moral climate like Hollywood, acting in a movie often means getting paid for acting in the movie and nothing more. It also may be that despite recent success for Christian producers and directors, Christians are still an easy target in Hollywood because either they don't complain or they are considered the enemy for their political or moral stance.

4620634,5,B00596WFE4,"This is a fine thriller!  It is somewhat unbelievable, but I am glad I continued viewing it.  The confrontation at the end made it all worth it. Good acting and fine atmosphere make this a must see!",1324080000,3,198,4.324324324324325
4620635,1,B00596WFE4,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The acting is poor, the story line terrible, and the theme is beyond belief. Psychopaths are giggling at the absurdity of this movie.",1323907200,2,176,4.5
4620646,3,B00596WFE4,"The guesswork in this film doesn't involve who dun it. We're shown the polite, pervasive serial killer early on. More of the guesswork revolves around why he dun it, and most of all - how he dun it. How could he know the most intimate details of the life of the detective he has targeted? How could the killer know every sexual encounter that now-mature detective had, going all the way back to high school? How could he know not only the identity of so many of the detective's many one-night stands, but also the location of each encounter?

Unfortunately, the movie becomes its own spoiler. It reveals the answer to this question about half-way through. If you aren't listening carefully, you might miss this revelation, which is made in a few incidental sentences. It's too bad that the writer decided to make this an almost throw-away part of the plot. This would have been a better movie if the killer's method of knowing had been made the heart of the film's mystery. It involves some very telling psychological insight.

There are other ways in which this movie could have been somewhat better. Once again, so much of the action centers on the clich of the different investigators' antagonism toward each other. Christian Slater, playing the FBI agent brought in on the case, is especially irritating in his automatic, over-the-top vituperations. It all makes you long for the likes of the old Dragnet and Columbo TV series, where more often than not, there was some level of respect and cooperation between the officers working on a case. Those plots weren't padded with pointless volleys of cursing.

Then the movie is somewhat marred by the inherent sexism of its plot. The detective whose exes are being picked off is asked to come up with a list of all his encounters. He judges there to be in excess of 100, and can't complete the list, either because he can't remember all his ""dates,"" or because he wants to be discrete about certain in-house alliances, however dangerous such discretion might be for the women involved.

The real sexism though comes through when we see many of the victims being absolutely, abjectly helpless once they are caught by the killer, even while they remain uninjured and unbound. One in particular remains inexplicably cringing on a bed while the killer turns his back to her and becomes absorbed in ranting out his rationale for his crimes. Why doesn't the woman even try to get away at this point? But she and other victims don't move. They seem to be transfixed into acceptance of their fate by the mere presence of a malevolent male figure.

There are two full-length commentaries on this DVD - one that includes the director, and one that includes the writer and some of the actors. I was hoping to find some discussion of these issues here. I was hoping to hear some conversation about the trouble they faced keeping Ray Liotta's character sympathetic, despite his history of one-night stands. But there isn't any such deeper discussion. Most of the commentaries consist of technical details about where blue screen was used, of rather fatuous mutual admiration, of the narration of hijinks on the set, and other such trivialities. So unless you have an unlimited amount of time, you can probably skip these extras.

Just watch the movie and take it for what it is - a somewhat suspenseful, upped version of a CSI episode, with some otherwise brilliant actors performing in these less radiant roles.",1321315200,,3449,4.807757166947724
4620647,4,B00596WFE4,Ray Liotta was excellent in this performance.  It had suspense mystery and a who done it at the end.  All the things a good mystery should have.  A movie about such a grim subject always allows the charater actor to delve into the dark side of danger and that element of suprise.,1320451200,4,279,4.326923076923077
4620648,4,B00596WFE4,I picked this movie up a couple of weeks ago and decided to watch it instead of watching the ravens get beat in Jacksonville this past Monday Night. I really enjoyed this movie even though you could tell it was a straight to DVD type deal. It had a really interesting story although at times it became a bit predictable . Christan Slater plays a real unlikeable cop I could definitely see him as my towns local cop. If you don't mind the fact that its not a huge Hollywood Blockbuster and just take a chance on it I think you'll really enjoy it,1319760000,2,544,4.240384615384615
4620649,3,B00596WFE4,"I really enjoy when Liotta does human. Obviously, I'm referring to its adjective usage. He's so often cast as the psychotic nutter or conniving monster, it's fascinating seeing him display humble and vulnerable; a person grounded with clay feet.

There's a real kindness and touching quality to him when he's not being himself, or perhaps this is an aspect of his real self that we don't get to see very often. Whatever the case, and much like his incredible work in the fantastic 2004 film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Control/dp/B00000FZL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Control</a>', I really appreciate these performances.

In this production Liotta plays Jack Verdon, a veteran police detective who finds himself at the crux of a series of murders that span the entire country. A brutal serial killer is on the loose and, one way or another, every death tracks back to him. Both his own department and the FBI have taken note - and they're looking for answers that he can't or won't supply. It's the latter option that has irked fellow law enforcement officers and placed suspicion onto Jack's actions, who seems unwilling to fully reveal his relationships to several of the victims.

It's clear he's being framed, but who can he trust? And what's really behind all the deaths?

The story itself is a cobbled patchwork of other similar films and themes, so don't expect any blindside plot shockers. Instead, if you're interested in seeing an actor going against type, then this fits into an unusual group of films that quietly blends and merges between strict definitions. In many ways this flick deviates from the action/thriller genre, under which it's categorized, and fits more into the character study of productions.

Every player on set executed solid performances with no obvious flaws or missteps; the script is reasonable, though uninspired. A passable flick that'll eat up a decent chunk of a rainy/snowy afternoon.

Personal Notes:

- The casting of Ving Rhames and Christian Slater is depressing evidence that both actors have fallen off the A-List. More surprising for Rhames, much less so for Slater who has long since jumped the shark of his own career.

Slater has been a interesting puzzle for me. Every time I've written him off - he stages a brief and memorable comeback. Recently, it was his insanely hilarious neo-hippie character in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Name-Is-Earl/dp/B000RO6JZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Name Is Earl</a>"". Undoubtedly impressing more than just myself, because soon thereafter he was given two more shots as lead actor in two different tv series. He's like the battery bunny of Hollywood, the guy keeps going and going; even though the beat is monotonously repetitive.",1319500800,6,2810,5.44367816091954
4620650,4,B00596WFE4,"If anyone other than Liotta had been in the movie it wouldnt have been worth watching. As usual the man comes through. A VERY underrated actor, partially because of a short term problem with drugs and alcohol, the man has ""cleaned up"" and even when he was having his ""problems"" I cannot recall seeing a movie that he appeared in that I didn't like.
I do recommend this movie.",1319328000,6,375,4.449275362318841
4620651,3,B00596WFE4,It's great to find a movie I want to see and can't get anywhere. Buying places for movies are drying up.,1319155200,3,104,4.0
4620652,4,B00596WFE4,"In this crime drama set in the rainy Northwest, homicide detective Liotta is the FBI's prime suspect is a series of mutilation killings. All are women he's been intimate with in the past. With plot holes large enough to drive a Humvee through and an out-of-left-field twist solution, it's saved only by the efforts of a solid cast.

Liotta's looking well-preserved, if chunky. Slater does his patented smarmy Nicholson imitation. Rhames underplays it to good effect.

For fans of these three, well worth seeing.

4620653,5,B00596WFE4,i rented this movie last week because i wanted to see if it was good enough to buy. i loved the storyline and im good at figuring out what who and why. when everyone was tryin to figure out why this guy was killing Ray Liotta's character ex girlfriends it was very easy for me when it came up that he got one of his ex's pregant and he thought it would be best if she got an abortion. right then i knew.,1318032000,,403,3.8674698795180724
4620654,3,B00596WFE4,"Wow!  Ray Liotta's cop character has had almost as many female conquests as ""Two and a Half Men's"" Charlie Harper!  Unfortunately, some of his exes are being gruesomely murdered.  Is Liotta the killer?  That's the dilemma in this slow-moving but intriguing B-movie.
Even though the killer's identity is revealed early on, his motivation is concealed but obvious at the same time.
Liotta, so good in GOODFELLAS and NARC, gives an oddly uneven performance, bouncing all over the place, underacting key scenes and overacting in lower-key moments.  He has little chemistry with his wife, an underwhelming Gisele Fragas, but has some good scenes with Ving Rhames, who is wasted as his partner.  Christian Slater drops by between his cancelled TV series to caricaturize an FBI profiler.  Michael Rodrick as the disturbed John is the most effective performer, his pretty boy looks masking a dark secret.  The religious overtone of the film is accentuated by a haunting musical score and there is some lovely Washington state scenery, even though it's always raining.
THE RIVER MURDERS often plays like an episode of 48 HOURS MYSTERY, but I got involved in its script, despite the movie's obvious flaws.  Crime enthusiasts should be entertained but it's not the most memorable of the genre's lot.",1317427200,4,1288,5.124401913875598
