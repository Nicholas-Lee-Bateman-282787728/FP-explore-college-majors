6307044,5,B00IZGPTZM,I guess you actually have to do the video for it to work. I previewed it to see if I would be able to keep up and it looks like I will. I am at about an intermediate skill level for working out.,1399420800,,194,3.5348837209302326

6307049,1,B00IZGPTZM,Was not what I expected. I was looking for a fun dance workout. The music is not good the moves are very suggestive and it was just not what I had hoped.,1456876800,2,153,3.8125

6307053,1,B00IZGPTZM,the disk stopped at the middle and needed restart. Also the contents are not too cool. Just another exercise tape. The sound and music is bad too.  Not impressed.  Wanted to return but just lazy to do that,1453852800,,205,4.368421052631579
6307054,3,B00IZGPTZM,Was supposed to be new but arrived open and re taped.,1453680000,,53,3.909090909090909

6307057,5,B00IZGPTZM,I really like the cd s,1445126400,,22,2.8333333333333335
6307058,5,B00IZGPTZM,"I am having such a kick with this workout!  Takes a while to really get down the moves so it's holding my attention.  Shaun T is personable, makes the moves easy to understand and follow.  You can just move along or really get into it for a solid workout.  Fun and fast!",1444003200,,270,4.134615384615385
6307059,5,B00IZGPTZM,great condition !,1439164800,,17,5.0
6307060,5,B00IZGPTZM,"Loved it!  If you're looking for a fun way to work out then this is the tape for you.  It is high energy, and hard work but in such a way that you hardly feel like you're working out.  That is until you start to feel that ab burn.",1431734400,,230,3.6530612244897958
6307061,5,B00IZGPTZM,Great workout......entertaining. If you have saddlebags.....the donkey kicks will whittle them away,1427846400,,99,7.333333333333333
6307062,5,B00IZGPTZM,"I LOVE this ridiculous workout?! Booty Time is SO much fun, and in the first five minutes of Hardcore Abs(assuming you're doing it properly) your abs are already on fire!",1417219200,,170,4.7
6307063,5,B00IZGPTZM,"Great workout! I LOVE Rock It Out, it's a total body burn and it's tough. I should add that it helps (but it isn't necessary) to be familiar with or to have done The 'Hip Hop Abs' workouts to get the ""tilt/tuck/tighten"" technique down. If you've done standing ab exercises before, you'll get it. Excellent seller - packed,  shipped and delivered as and when desired & described.",1411430400,4,378,4.641791044776119
6307064,3,B00IZGPTZM,definitely need to build up to it. a lot of work but hopefully will be worth it when I can invest more time in it,1410220800,,113,3.56
8646818,5,B00IZGPTZM,"Shaun T is great. He keeps you motivated. This is not for beginners, especially at my age of 53. I've done some of his other workouts until an injury left me u able to workout for 2 years. I started with an easier, low impact program from Richard Simmons. It took a couple of months, but it wasn't enough anymore. This DVD will really get me in shape. Great cardio in all 3 workouts. Rock it out is an all over body workout, with emphasis on core strengthening. Weights are used (if you like) to intensify; great arm work as well. The most challenging for me is the 6 sets of push-ups (10 reps each) followed by work in the plank position. I'll work  up to that. It's about 35 minutes. Hard-core abs is a quick 10 minute, and great abs workout. Very doable and effective for intermediate level exercisers. The 3rd workout is Booty Time and runs about 30 minutes. It's fun to do and very effective. Works the Booty, quads, and hips. I have a knee injury, so I'm careful and Shaun constantly reminds you to keep your knee in a safe position. Lunges and squats are difficult with my knee injury, so I follow the moderator, Tanya. She uses less intensity on every move throughout the entire program and I often work as she does. It's something I love about Shaun T's routines. Running is not for me, going to the gym with boring reps is not for me, but dancing and moving through this workout is fun and very effective. I highly recommend it for those who exercise at an intermediate to advanced level.",1528675200,,1498,4.388489208633094
8646819,5,B00IZGPTZM,Love it replay work all the time I really like that there are people set up to n video are are at my speed also the timer is a great tool just love the work out,1518825600,,160,3.4722222222222223
8646820,5,B00IZGPTZM,"Not what I was expecting but I love it, as always Shaun T never fails. I love the music and the warm up, easy to do if your not so in shape. If your looking for a change in your work out game try it.",1506038400,,199,3.4444444444444446

8646827,2,B00IZGPTZM,I love ShaunT.dvd's but this one just didn't do it for me.  It's kind of monotonous and seems to do closeups on body parts.  Bleh.  Not to say it isn't good but the visuals just kind of turn me off.,1469750400,2,198,3.9
