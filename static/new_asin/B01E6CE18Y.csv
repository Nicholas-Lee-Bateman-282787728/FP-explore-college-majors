7731665,3,B01E6CE18Y,This movie is more or less seems like one of thos direct to DVD knock off movies.  Fairytale/Storybook characters have come from another universe and a group of these are fighting to save the world from destruction.  The team does have some similarities to 'Suicide Squad' but it also puts its own spin on that template.  I think it's worth watching + it's free with Amazon Prime.,1482624000,,380,4.641791044776119
7731666,5,B01E6CE18Y,A fun sequel to Avengers Grimm. I'm looking forward to the next fairy tale super universe movie release.,1482624000,,104,4.833333333333333
7731667,1,B01E6CE18Y,Just didn't like it,1482624000,,19,4.0
7731668,1,B01E6CE18Y,"A really really really bad attempt to make a Suicide Squad clone. Acting on the level of bad community theater. Slightly interesting concept, but poorly written and nearly plotless destroying anything that might have been good about this movie. This is time truly wasted.",1482278400,,271,5.181818181818182
7731669,1,B01E6CE18Y,it was ok cheesy. The plot I thought was stupid the so called powers people had just lame and a way bad knock off of suicide squad would not watch this again if someone paid me to,1481241600,,179,3.864864864864865
7731670,5,B01E6CE18Y,Awesome,1480809600,,7,7.0
7731671,5,B01E6CE18Y,"I loved this movie. Sure, it was like Suicide Squad but it was fun and the plot made sense. Loved Alice, she was baller, and everyone in the cast was fun. Piper and Rumple were clearly the best characters and I loved the story because it wanted you to not understand what was going on and who was really calling the shots. And I always am impressed with a movie that is cool with saying ""eff it, let's just go for it.""",1480291200,,418,4.109756097560975
7731672,5,B01E6CE18Y,Quality Asylum movie!  Imagine Suicide Squad meets Once Upon A Time. Decent for a best worst movie marathon.,1476403200,2,108,5.0
7731673,2,B01E6CE18Y,"So I go 2 stars because Sinister was spelled right and because there were one or two characters that acted well and I liked. the story????? The dialog????? all suspect. So I will only say that 2 or 3 characters were okay the rest no so much. The ""sets"" some abandoned warehouse, i'm guessing. Most of the actors and I use the term loosely were way over the top in a bad way.",1473724800,,374,4.136986301369863
7731674,1,B01E6CE18Y,"Good storybook characters capture bad storybook characters and hold them in a big warehouse and plan to use them to fight Death, who has some unknown plan that involves the broken magic mirror. Yup, it is as bad as it sounds.

This is an Asylum film, perhaps designed to be a mockbuster of ""Suicide Squad"" which they got out a bit too soon. At first I thought this was a sequel to ""Avenger's Grim"" that no one saw, but this included characters from non-Grim stories  such as Alice in Wonderland.

In addition to being an ideal that is not completely sound, the execution was bad in acting and dialogue. It had idiotic ""boing"" noises as if it was a kid's movie.

No swearing sex, or nudity.  Good luck making it past 15 minutes.",1468022400,7,727,4.43609022556391
7731675,5,B01E6CE18Y,"I have to say, this movie is actually really cool.  And the bad guy is very funny.  I can't say more...  I'd suggest not to get affected by the low ratings others give.  It's a good movie to enjoy on a weekend night.",1509926400,,216,3.953488372093023
7731676,1,B01E6CE18Y,Very bad acting!  Turned it off after few minutes.,1505088000,,50,4.555555555555555
7731677,3,B01E6CE18Y,It's a run of the mill Asylum movie. Could have done without the goofy sound effects.,1504828800,,85,4.375
7731678,3,B01E6CE18Y,"While the germ of the idea may have come from The Suicide Squad (who took it from The Dirty Dozen, who...) it is enough of a change-up to stand on its own.  Nicely paced with decent twists and reasonable acting I enjoyed this as a 'background' movie.  The best thing about it was the complete lack of David Ayer type bombarding the viewer with gratuitous explosions.",1504569600,,366,4.53030303030303
7731679,5,B01E6CE18Y,Nice story with surprising twists. Acting wasn't bad. Rumplestiltskin was a surprise in the mix with the big bad wolf and blue beard on the side. Alice was madder than the hatter. Fun.,1499904000,,184,4.606060606060606
7731680,1,B01E6CE18Y,"I think my 4 year old son could make a better movie.  Worst actors and no plot.  The director must be deaf and blind to let this crap out on video.  I would not be proud of it at all.  Embarrassment is the right word,",1495497600,,217,3.7555555555555555
7731681,3,B01E6CE18Y,A decent take on the story book tales.  Alice from Wonderland and Goldielocks take on the evil-over lord from Hades.  A decent watchable movie.,1492646400,,143,4.916666666666667
7731682,4,B01E6CE18Y,Not bad for a fairytale type of movie. A bit comical.,1492128000,,53,3.909090909090909
7731683,4,B01E6CE18Y,"Most of the actors are great love Alice. The plot is good. I have nothing to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon so I just gave this movie a try, this movie turned out good with convincing acting and a nice story.",1490486400,,210,4.023809523809524
7731684,5,B01E6CE18Y,Dont buy into the hate.......Fables meets Grimm meets Steampunk. Freakin awesome!!!,1488326400,,83,6.636363636363637

7731687,2,B01E6CE18Y,"This was too much like a Once Upon a Time Knock Off, It brought nothing fresh or different to the table.",1485820800,,104,4.0
7731688,1,B01E6CE18Y,FELT IT WAS A CHEAP KNOCKOFF OF SUICIDE SQUAD,1485820800,,45,4.111111111111111
7731689,1,B01E6CE18Y,"Cheap ripoff of Suicide Squad. Poor script,acting,directing and special effects. Don't waste your time on this trash.",1485820800,,117,5.9411764705882355
7731690,1,B01E6CE18Y,Couldn't watch it...started to watch and got about 20 minutes in. Had to turn it off.,1485820800,,85,4.375

7731694,5,B01E6CE18Y,"Gave it 5 stars, although I admit being a little biased. My daughter is the feral cannibalistic witch.  Otherwise, it would be a 3 or 4.",1485129600,,136,4.230769230769231
7731695,1,B01E6CE18Y,I poor copy of Suicide Squad.  One of the few times I didn't finish a movie...doesn't deserve the 1 star amazon makes you give.,1485129600,,127,4.291666666666667
7731696,2,B01E6CE18Y,"Could have been a great movie,the acting a storylines were pretty good.but the cinematography and editing were weak.with just a little better lighting and sound I probably would have watched the whole thing.",1485129600,,207,5.303030303030303
7731697,4,B01E6CE18Y,Yes it was low budget. Yes some of the acting was sub par. Yes some of the special effects were so so. But it was a fun movie that I enjoyed watching. When I expected to hate it. So give it a chance.,1484611200,,199,3.6511627906976742
7731698,1,B01E6CE18Y,Bad movie all around. I got amazon prime because they had a good selection of movies but now it's 90 percent b list movies ..... do better amazon.,1484438400,,146,4.25

7731700,3,B01E6CE18Y,fairy tales and nursery rhymes made over into bad guys and heroes comic book style.  rather out there strange-wise. Has a fascination for dental appliances and weird eyebrows.,1483920000,,175,5.25

7731703,1,B01E6CE18Y,Just too weird. ..Sry.,1483574400,,22,4.75
7731704,4,B01E6CE18Y,"This is a very clever Suicide Squad meets Once Upon a Time mash up. Although cheesy and a little slow, still pretty enjoyable. One of the better indie films I've found on AP. Worth a watch for a good laugh and some fun action.",1483228800,,226,4.159090909090909
8757847,1,B01E6CE18Y,I tried to make it through this movie. This is just a bad movie. It was not about understanding of why the plot was off or lack of character development. This movie is just bad. The concept seems good. However I could not waste another minute on this movie.,1533340800,,257,4.26530612244898
8757848,1,B01E6CE18Y,May be the worst low-budget ripoff ever made.,1533081600,,45,4.75
8757849,1,B01E6CE18Y,"The acting is terrible and the dialogue is corny (but not intentionally or in an entertaining way). As some have already pointed out, Alice is absolutely dreadful and what ultimately made me give up on this movie. But don't get me wrong, everything else is bad too.",1532908800,,265,4.659574468085107
8757850,1,B01E6CE18Y,It was a lame VERY LOW budget movie.,1529625600,,36,3.625

8757852,4,B01E6CE18Y,"There are movies made for art and movies made for fun... anything from The Asylum is definitely made for fun. This is a sequel to Avengers Grimm but my friends and I gave up after 20 minutes with that one. Sinister Squad, on the other hand, stands on its own and was ridiculous, colorful, and cheesy from beginning to end. It wasn't really what I was expecting and most of us agreed that we actually enjoyed watching it just as much as we did making fun of it. It helps that this, like a lot of Asylum movies, have a good sense of humor about what they're producing. They sure lucked out with this one... who knew the mockbuster for Suicide Squad would be more fun to watch than the movie it's emulating?",1519430400,,704,4.3007518796992485
8757853,2,B01E6CE18Y,"1.5 stars really, omg the characters are stupid and man I couldn't get past Alice.",1518307200,,82,4.533333333333333
8757854,3,B01E6CE18Y,"This isn't the best movie, but it's worth watching once for free.  If the characters in the movie weren't fairy tale characters, it would make it more passable.

Even so, it's worth watching if you get it through prime.",1518220800,,219,4.589743589743589
