1520581,5,B00005JNHU,"This TV Series which was part of the ""wheel"" segmant of the 1970's NBC Sunday Night Mystery Movies is now out on DVD.  This series is based on a 1968 Clint Eastwood film called ""Coogan's Bluff"" in which a Western type lawman goes to New York City to capture a escaped criminal and Giving New York Cities finest a lesson in frontier Justice.  Finally you can now see this program uncut, and no Mr. Whipple or Cal Worthington to to interrupt your viewing.",1123286400,3,453,4.445783132530121
1520582,5,B00005JNHU,"A previous reviewer -- who didn't like this series -- described McCloud as ""a Texas cop come to the Big Apple."" I can't take this dismissive review seriously because this reviewer clearly knew very little about this outstanding series in which Dennis Weaver played a deputy marshall from Taos, New Mexico -- not Texas. The reviewer got the Big Apple part correct, though, since McCloud was on temporary assignment to the New York police department for several seasons.

Personally I loved this series because McCloud was the ultimate maverick, rescuing people and solving cases by ingenuity, persistence, and courage with little concern for the fine print in the rules. My three favorite TV adventure series were Maverick, McCloud, and Remington Steele. Fortunately, McCloud and  Remington Steele are scheduled to be available on DVD shortly. If you liked one of these series you may also like the others, as I do.",1119916800,52,914,5.086666666666667

1520764,5,B00005JNHU,"I bought this locally a couple of years ago and enjoy it more each it time I view it. I'm old enough to remember it on TV and it was one of the better programs that ran as a part of about three different limited series that were more or less being shown to see if there was a market for producing more for continuing seasons.
Having read a number of blogs about McCloud, I found some clarification about the uneven storylines of the ""first season"" on these discs. They are not actually as originally shown, in that when they were reissued, they combined parts from episodes to make them longer fit into a particular time slot. Some of the dialogue didn't make sense until I read this, but I still enjoy the results.
One drawback about this set is that the discs are all two sided which make them more vulnerable to damage. I do have a light scratch on one that I am trying to repair, but it occurs at the end of an episode, so the story is pretty much intact.
One other thing I would like to point out is that one website I researched advised that there are not likely to be any dvds produced of the rest of the initial episodes since the tapes were apparently not maintained by Universal and so cannot be remade for issue in the USA. The writer did say that a collector in Australia did have some intact tapes of the series and the episodes are in distribution currently only in Australia and New Zealand. If anyone is seriously interested in having them released in USA perhaps they could start a petition to send to Universal Studios to get them to negotiate cooperation in releasing them here. If that does not work out, do an internet search and see if you can get an AU copy and a dvd player to run them on.
I did buy ""The Return of Sam McCloud"" on Amazon recently and enjoy it as much as I do the original series.",1425427200,,1820,4.247838616714698

I was in HS during its initial release, and now with better clarity the subject and plot.  To enjoy the future you must start at the beginning [ History starts with traction]. McCloud has it all.

1520837,1,B00005JNHU,"I liked this when it was originally on TV but maybe I didn't see the first season. Maybe it got better as time went on. I like Dennis Weaver and his acting was fine. But the scripts, most of the acting, and what must have been the directing, were cheesy and overdone and I just can't go on watching it (I have watched the first few episodes).

I was the eldest of six siblings and therefore the last to get to choose.  No VCR at that time.  I only got to see McCloud on rare occasions.  Having the set is like unlimited access.

Life and times were simpler than.  McCloud has a direct and sincere way of reaching people successfully which I appreciate more now than I did then which I didn't think was possible.  McCloud is good-natured, stands up to crime and criminals, and he always gets his man!  His methods are rather unorthodox but hey, whatever works.  I had a great time watching this DVD and will order more a little at a time.  And, thank you Amazon for your great shipping.  I received the DVD in 5 days which is unheard of in Hawaii.  I ordered another DVD from Target the same day and it took 5 weeks to get here.  I just received it yesterday and have been enjoying McCloud and McMillan $ Wife for four weeks.  Amazon is the best!

For the movie that inspired McCloud, you might also want to check out Clint Eastwood's ""Coogan's Bluff"".  Some will disagree, but there is no doubting that the 1968 film loosely, if not greatly, inspired the 1970 television series.",1334361600,,396,4.486111111111111

1521029,5,B00005JNHU,"When Deputy Marshal Sam McCloud (Dennis Weaver), of Taos, NM, captures a fugitive wanted in New York City, he isn't counting on being told off to escort his prey back East (""'F I'd'a known they 's gonna extradite y'clean back t'New York I'd'a left y'there!"" he says).  But of such small things is Destiny compounded.  The Marshal's fugitive is literally kidnapped out from under his nose, and after recapturing him McCloud finds himself assigned to stay in the Big Apple and study ""big-city police methods.""  In fact it's more like showing the big city how well country methods work there.  Sam's down-home manner, careless approach to procedure, and homely saws often bewilder his reluctant partner, Sgt. Joe Broadhurst (Terry Carter), and infuriate his immediate superior, Chief Peter B. Clifford (Mark Richman in the pilot, J. D. Cannon thereafter), but he's tough, stubborn, shrewd, compassionate, a keen observer, and a close student of human nature, and somehow he always seems to get his man (or sometimes, in a nod to the developing power of Women's Lib, his woman).  Indeed, over time, though still often exasperated by him, Clifford comes to view him with more sympathy and respect (nothing succeeds like success, after all), while Sam quickly acquires a lady friend, journalist and author Chris Coughlin (Diana Muldaur), whose frequent mentions of him in her column tend to cause ""trouble in the bunkhouse,"" as Sam says.  (""Chief Clifford's jealous?""  ""Jealous ain't quite the word, try homicidal."")  46 when the series began and six years off his iconic role as Chester in ""Gunsmoke,"" Weaver was a perfect choice for the part of Marshal McCloud, which truly showcased his abilities as something other than a ""sidekick;"" his inimitable Joplin, MO, drawl and easy, lanky look made the character as much a standout as Chester ever was, and unique in the time period.  And while the 1970s ambience may seem somewhat dated, crime--and the passions that cause it--remains the same regardless of time period.  Unfortunately this two-season set only includes 11 episodes owing to the series's scheduling as part of a rotation, and while Seasons 3-4 are available in European format, Universal so far seems unwilling to release them in their native land.  All fans should bombard them with e-mails demanding more of Sam McCloud.",1323907200,4,2331,5.1078947368421055

1521031,4,B00005JNHU,"McCloud is part of the NBC Mystery Movie lineup in the 1970's. This included Columbo, Macmillan and Wife and others that were not as successful. All these shows have one important theme, cases are solved in an unorthodox manner. McCloud (Dennis Weaver) is a marshall from New Mexico and he was asked to join the NYPD to observe and share investigation techniques. It turns out the most of the cases are solved using his techniques, much to the frustration of the captain (J D Cannon) he is working with. One of his trademarks is to ride a horse to get across the city when he feels a car is impractical. Video quality is very good, the episodes look pretty intact, although I am not a great McCloud fan the plots are pretty exciting. Still like Columbo better. This disk has a bonus episode from  MacMillan and Wife. Universal always likes to put previews on Disk 1, but at least you can easily skip them by pushing menu on your DVD remote control. For the price it is a good value. This set is easy to use because Universal did split the disk sets by season and placed them in their own jacket.",1319500800,,1095,4.420792079207921

But their decision is wrong, because McCloud really found itself in season 3.

We love McCloud because of its character, humor, and action.
Although the character element is there in season 1&2, we do not see as much humor and action as we would like to see in the series.
All the masterpiece episodes such as ""The New Mexican connection"", ""The Colorado Cattle caper"", ""The Park Avenue rustlers"", ""Butch Cassidy rides again"", and the ""Alamo"" episodes are after season 3 onwards.
Their story-line is impossible without McCloud in its central character while all the stories in season 1&2 can work in any detective series.

I do hope that Universal release all the remaining seasons.  That should help the sales of season 1&2 DVD as well.

As to season 1&2 DVD, I am happy that they are finally available on DVD.

Back in the late 60's and early to mid 70's, there was no such thing as Batamaxes and VCR's so I would record TV shows on a reel-to-reel tape recorder, mostly ""It Takes A Thief"" which I believe to have every show and waiting for them to bring it out on DVD. Back in the 70's CB's were all the rage and Mc Cloud was my CB handle. I wore cowboy boots in the warehouse where I worked. The guys at work called me ""Tex"". I wore the same cowboy boots in the very first 18 hole round of golf I played.

Anyway, here's some facts for the rest of you fans, the Mc Cloud pilot came out on ""NBC Tuesday Night at the Movies Premier"" His coat was a swede coat with lambs wool lining, not a tweed. I now have to match the DVD's I have with my tapes to see if in fact they did hack and edit the heck out of them. I could go on with more, but I forget what everyone else wrote.

Back to my tapes. Because I did enjoy my TV back then, I would record all kinds of shows. Mod Squad, Hawaii 5-0, Bill Cosby comedy specials, Laugh-In with William F. Buckley. I also have the last ""Chet Huntley & David Brinkley"" news report, the list goes on and on. Who knew back then that there would be home video recorders.

1521103,5,B00005JNHU,"Producers, are you listening?

We want all the remaining seasons of McCloud. The current DVD set of seasons 1 and 2 has only served to wet our appetite. The later seasons include some of the funniest scenes of McCloud ever. First, there is McCloud investigating a stolen car ring that specializes in luxury cars. McCloud goes undercover to investigate, and then starts stealing cars himself, then calls Chief Clifford on the phone and says ""Chief, I just stole my first car""!

Next episode, McCloud takes an unauthorized trip to Rome Italy, and then calls Broadhurst from there. Broadhurst then runs in the Chief's office and shouts ""McCloud is on the phone, he is calling from Rome."" Chief says, ""Rome New York?"" Broadhurst says, ""No, Rome Italy"". Chief grabs the phone and shouts ""McCloud, what are you doing in Italy"". Later, the same thing happens, except this time from London England.

Next episode, McCloud is somewhere out west, again undercover, in a bar room with a bunch of crooks sitting at a table, when Chief Clifford (who was desperately looking for him) walks in the door. Just as Chief Clifford yells out ""McCloud""....Dennis Weaver jumps up from the table (still trying to conceal his cover to the crooks) and yells out 'Who You Callin Loud"" and decks the Chief hard in the face. A big fight results, the sheriff jumps in and says ""All right, who started this"" Someone else yells out ""He Did"" and points to the unconscious Chief Clifford lying on the floor!

There were other episodes with John Denver, including a duet with them both singing.

The women love him; the men respect him.  He has the independence of a canny country horse trader who sometimes does things his own way, prodded by his own clear perceptions of the situation, creating interesting tension between him and his superior, Chief Clifford, gruffly played by J.D.

1521170,5,B00005JNHU,"In the 1970, NBC had a Sunday mystery movie wheel. Columbo, McCloud, McMillian and Wife were the staples. After its successful openning it spawn Quincy and later Hec Ramsey (a Western mystery series which was the last series Richard Boone did for TV and not available yet on DVD!). This also spawned a Wednesday mystery wheel which didn't fare as good.

McCloud took his cue from Clint Eastwood's Coogan Bluff (1968).Eastwood was offered to play Coogan for the future NBC Mystery Movie Wheel , but turn down doing another TV  series.

Universal revamp Coogan to the talents of Dennis Weaver. And McCloud was born. This fish outta water detective who spoke country wisdom, using his country ways and laid-back approach to nab the bad guys and never gave up. The show was a hit for both Weaver and NBC. McCloud stayed with Columbo and Millian to the end of the series in 1977.

McCoud was assigned to the detective bureau headed by Chief Peter B. Clifford. One of the highlight of the show was McCloud was a foil to his chief, played richly by the late  J.D. Cannon.

I am glad this show made in to DVD. However put more McCloud out soon. I want the John Denver episode from season five. Where most of Denver's dialog is the word ""Far out!""

The addition of a McMillian and wife episode is NICE, but why use one that is on the McMillian DVD set? They should have released a show from third or fourth season. And there isn't a Dennis Weaver interview or audio commentary on this collection

So CHIEF, adios and lets Universal DVD fill the McCloud  well back up soon

1521171,4,B00005JNHU,"I always liked ""McCloud"" and was glad to see them being released on DVD. Although it's been covered by other reviewers, it's worth noting that the season one episodes are actually amalgams of two episodes cut together, normally in a fairly disjointed manner. I found the pilot interesting from an academic point of view, but the best episodes in the set are from season two, which are shown in their original versions.

One thing that I had forgotten over the years was the amount of stock footage and repeated montage shots that pad out some of the episodes. While that is a bit annoying, overall the series is still very enjoyable, and has largely aged more gracefully than most contemporaries from the era (excepting ""Columbo."") Dennis Weaver is genuinely likeable as McCloud, and is a perfect contrast to Chief Clifford (J.D. Cannon), who is my favorite of the recurring characters in the series. (""McCloud!"")

Many notable guest stars appear in the show, including Richard Dawson (who is extremely unlikable in one of the most recut of the season one episodes, ""Manhattan Manhunt""), Randolph Mantooth (from ""Emergency,"" and here seen in a much less likeable role that that of Johnny Gage), and even an evil Milton Berle who, along with Vic Tayback, star as evil theater producers in ""Give My Regrets to Broadway."" The writing and guest actors are somewhat uneven, and aside from the choppiness of the season one episodes, ""A Little Plot at Tranquil Valley"" (guest starring Burgess Meredith) is probably the weakest in overall execution. Throughout the series occasional bonuses occur such as McCloud accompanying a string quartet on his harmonica, and even singing!

The set comes with a bonus episode of ""McMillan & Wife"" which I did not get all the way through, as I find it a bit more boring and dated than ""McCloud"" and ""Columbo."" I give the set four stars. It's great to see McCloud finally on DVD, though some extras would have been nice. I would have liked to see the season one shows in their original versions, as well, but there is doubt that the original versions exist at this point.",1132790400,7,2100,4.844011142061281

The script-writing is awful. The plots are lousy. The jokes are lame, the arguing with the Chief forced, the love-making with Chris ridiculous! Not enough Terry Carter, either. The guest stars (except Julie Sommars) are given almost nothing to do!

1521174,4,B00005JNHU,"It is indeed very nice to be able to watch this fantastic series in the best quality format. However, I must agree with the other reviewers here who commented on the fact that the first season has been badly hacked. For some of you who may read this, but not understand what we mean, here's the poop.
  On September 16, 1970 NBC unveiled a new series called ""Four in One."" It was comprised of four mini-series:
  1. McCloud
  2. San Francisco International Airport
  3. Night Gallery
  4. The Psychiatrist
  Each mini-series ran for a period of six consecutive weeks. Then they were rerun on a rotation basis. They aired on Wednesday nights from 10:00 - 11:00.
  ""McCloud"" went on to the ""Mystery Movie"" series, ""San Francisco International Airport"" left the air with the ""Four in One"" series as did ""The Psychiatrist."" ""Night Gallery"" spun off into it's own series.
  On disc one, the ""Four in One"" episodes appear in 90 minute form, combining two 60 minute episodes. What a bummer!
  It would have been really great to see the original ""Four in One"" opening. I seem to remember a square with a black background, and they did something with the square, moving it around or having it morph into other things or something, it's really hard to remember because it was so long ago and I was all of 7 years old at the time. But, I seem to remember it stopped with a 4 in the box, making it look to my young mind like a child's block.
  Same with the ""Mystery Movie"" opening. Remember the guy (looked like McCloud to me) walking slowly toward the camera with a flashlight, shining it from side to side as shots for each element of the series would flash up? All the while that really neat whistling theme played. TV still had some pretty neat things at that time.
  Still, I'm glad to have this set. But, it would have been really nice to have the original openings and more importantly, the first season in its unaltered form.",1126569600,14,1922,4.494219653179191

I remember the show from it's origional run back in the early 70's, but I'd forgotten many of the details of the shows that made them fun.  Dennis Weaver is really cool as McCloud, and being from the SW myself, I like seeing a  virtuous western lawman hold his own with NY's finest.  The scenes shot in NYC are fascinating to me as I've never visited.  In one episode the unfinished second tower of the World Trade Center is very visible beside the one that was finished at the time.  I enjoyed seeing the familiar faces of actors I'd seen in other Universal shows, especially a very young Randolph Mantooth, Vince Howard, James McEachin, Raul Julia, Gregory Sierra, just to name a few.  J.D. Cannon was also perfect as the long suffering Chief Clifford.  I also like Terry Carter as McClouds's sometimes reluctant partner, but I loved the wry barbs that Sgt. Thatcher ,(James McEachin) and McCloud exchanged in The Disposal Man episode.  The dvds are sharp and clear, the captioning is nice, I enjoy this type of show so much more than the modern cop shows, I recommend it highly, especially the first two seasons that are in this set.",1126137600,9,1189,4.544600938967136
1521176,1,B00005JNHU,"We bought ""the series.""  What we got was Season 2 complete (unless any were originally 2 hours in length); the pilot tv movie McCLOUD: WHO KILLED MISS U.S.A.? bearing the syndication title PORTRAIT OF A DEAD GIRL; and three 90-minute ""movies"" each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random, unrelated one-hour episodes of the show's first season - which ran under the umbrella title, 4 IN 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix!  For those studio executives who don't understand the concept, nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing...the way it was...not frankensteined into phony movies.  If Universal had any integrity at all, they'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited, original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes...with the 4 IN 1 umbrella sequence...and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1, season 1.  I supposed next we'll have to beware of COLUMBO and other MYSTERY MOVIE 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform (and yet being sold as ""The Complete Season!""",1124841600,48,1220,4.9365853658536585
1521177,4,B00005JNHU,"A fun mystery series, ""McCloud"" was re-edited by Universal taking six 60 minute episodes and making them into three 90 minute episodes for syndication. What we have here is the syndicated version which means that footage has been cut from the episodes as they combined various episodes into one 90 minute TV movie. The show in its original format would have earned five stars for its best episodes. The original elements for the series has to exist but Universal just elected not to bother and find them and/or restore them to their original length. That's too bad as it indicates a much larger problem that seems to exist at Universal's marketing department-they just don't care. It's just product for them. Warner Home Video actually takes pride and adds extras and commentaries to most of their TV on DVD releases. They actually bring value to fans. Universal, on the other hand, has only started adding more extras recently to select titles but keeping most bare bones. I'm not so sure about season two because I haven't seen many of these in years but the first season I do recall seeing in syndication and noticing footage missing. We do get the pilot episode as well which is a big plus.

Looks like ""McCloud"" knocked the dust off his boots when he arrived on DVD. While there's some analog artifacts in the form of dirt, etc. that are evident in this transfer, the episodes look extremely good in an unforgiving format. Could they have been cleaned up a bit? Frankly, yes but their presentation is pretty solid overall. There is some digital artifacts evident but it's not a huge amount. The colors have faded a bit but overall given the age of the series ""McCloud"" looks pretty good. The mono sound doesn't offer much opportunity for improvement but that's fine as the dialog is clear and the music, despite occasional distortion, sounds good.

Universal is doing its cross promotional thing again as they did with ""Sliders: Season Three""/""Earth 2""/""Cleopatra 2525"" where episodes from other genre related shows were put on as an extra. It's a pretty cheap extra and clever marketing I just don't think it's good value for customers.  Given that most of the main actors are still alive, it's a pity that there's no retrospective documentary or discussion of the popularity of this series. Weaver can be a charming storyteller and Muldaur captivating. I'm sure if both were asked to revisit one of their popular successes they'd be willing to do so.",1124496000,23,2457,4.831353919239905
1521178,5,B00005JNHU,"As the most fanatical McCloud fan in the world (I'll arm wrestle anyone who says I'm not) it is an understatement to say that I am delighted that the series has been issued on DVD--AT LAST!  The three double-side DVD's, housed in sturdy slim cases, contain Seasons One and Two.  The episodes are arranged in chronological order, with a filler episode of ""MacMillan and Wife."" The transfer has obviously been done with some care--the series has never looked so good on TV--one can even make out the texture of the tweed in McCloud's jacket.  Despite some occasional graininess, it looks as if the series might have been filmed yesterday!  There are Spanish and English subtitles, and each episode has a helpful and informative synopsis menu.

Are the episodes complete and uncut?...well, yes and no...  First, the good news--Season Two appears to be uncut.  Nowadays, when McCloud runs on TV, the first few minutes of ""establishing scenes"" preceding the opening credits are invariably omitted.  Frequently, the ""summing up"" scenes at the end are cut, too.  These are often really funny vignettes, such as McCloud roping a crook from a moving taxicab at the beginning of ""Fifth Man in a String Quartet.""  Most of these scenes have not been shown on TV since about 1986.  They usually contribute little if anything to the central story, and were obviously cut to allow more commercials.  On the other hand, they contribute a LOT to the establishment of character.  This is important--one of the strengths of the series was that it successfully managed the tricky mixture of believable character comedy and detective story--more in the subtle manner of ""The Thin Man"" rather than the situation comedy of ""Barney Miller"".  Without this comic leavening, police dramas can become unbearably grim.  It is absolutely wonderful to have these scenes back!

It's also great to have the pilot episode, which I don't recall seeing on TV since about 1985.  Viewers will notice an inconsistency in Chris's account of how she first met McCloud.  In the first episode of Season One, Chris says that she met him while vacationing in New Mexico.  The pilot has it otherwise--their real first meeting was in New York--of course, this doesn't affect one's enjoyment.

Now, the bad news.  Season One originally consisted of six one-hour episodes.  UNIVERSAL studios later combined these into three one-and-a-half hour programs.  Contrary to the misinformation disseminated from some internet sources, these DVD's give Season One only in this later, mutilated form.  Maybe the original material no longer exists, or perhaps no one cared enough to search for it, or maybe UNIVERSAL thought no one would notice. Heaven knows how much good stuff we'll never see again.

I have never seen the first season in its original form (it's difficult to get to a TV exactly when you want to when one has been drafted into Army basic training). However, back issues of TV GUIDE are a valuable source of information.  Doubtless, much must have fallen to the cutting room floor during re-editing.  A case in point is episode two (""Horse Stealing on Fifth Avenue""), which was grafted onto episode four (""The Stage is All the World"") producing a hybrid called ""Manhattan Manhunt.""  The ""horse stealing,"" which gives ""Horse Stealing"" its title, was completely removed, and all that remains is the subplot about a drugstore bandit.

Further observations:  I don't understand the point (other than  advertising) of including an episode of ""McMillan and Wife.""  Surely there were more appropriate fillers, such as the sequel, ""The Return of Sam McCloud,"" or maybe the episode of the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries in which Weaver appears as himself filming an episode of McCloud, or ""Murder Can Hurt You"" in which Buck Owens delivers a McCloud parody as ""Sheriff Tim McSky!"" Even interviews with the cast about the making of the series would be nice--most of them are still around (update of 4/09--Weaver died a few years ago).  A recent e-mail to UNIVERSAL inquiring about the exact contents of the DVD's and offering suggestions for fillers, elicited the reply that there were ""no plans at present to issue this series on DVD.""  Make of THAT what you will...

Another caveat: check disk one carefully--I have already gone through two defective copies. On both, the second episode on side B (""Murder Arena"")froze and refused to play any further.  On the first copy, this occurred at about 36:00, and on the second, at about 49:00.  I tried two different players, both recent Toshiba models, with identical results.  Hopefully, Universal will correct this problem.

So, is this set worth your investment?--yes, definitely!  Notwithstanding my agonizing about Season One, this is probably as close as we'll ever get to having McCloud on home video.  Because of my disappointment about Season One, I had originally intended to give this release just four stars, but this series is too good for that.  Indeed, I'd give it more than five stars if Amazon's rating system allowed it!  That off my chest, it's great to have this excellent series in such a fine DVD transfer.  Despite my complaints, I wouldn't be without it, and enthusiastically recommend McCloud to viewers who are unfamiliar with the series. Now, let's have the other five seasons (Three and Four should fit nicely onto three double-sided DVD's!)--hopefully, it won't take another 35 years!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT UPDATE! I share the pain of everyone who has been frustrated by the criminal neglect of this series at the hands of Universal. The good news is that the complete series has been liscensed to an Australian company called ""Madman."" Seasons 1-4 have already been released, and 5 is promised for October of 2011. Further good news is that Season 1 is in its ORIGINAL FORM of three 50 minute episodes. The bad news is that the discs are Region 4--Australia, et al.! WHY? Still, the easy way around it is a multi-region DVD player. The transfers look at least as good as the Unversal set, and the discs are single-side, not double side, so they are less prone to manufacuting errors. Unfortunately, copyright problems with the estate of Ricky Nelson forced trimming the few snippets of his songs out of ""The New Mexico Connection,"" but at least that's better than the Scandinavian releases, which omit the episode altogther.",1123804800,120,6466,5.127862595419847

7940534,3,B00005JNHU,"Give the DVD discs a 5 star but the horrible DVD boxing a 1 star so 3 star all around. The quality is good for those years of movie and being TV movies before 1997, they would be in the 4x3 format. Did not like the Chief Clifford in the Pilot so glad they changed him from then on, too bad you can get the other 4 seasons, as some of those had some of the funniest moments in the series in those.",1512950400,,396,3.783132530120482
