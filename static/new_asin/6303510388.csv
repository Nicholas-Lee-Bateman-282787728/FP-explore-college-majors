8596927,5,6303510388,"This movie has all the ingredients missing in today's romantic comedies.  Delightful characters who develop, situations resulting from misunderstandings, snappy, quick dialogue, some light-hearted music, and  Betty Hutton at her best.  This aired on Nick@Nite's movie when the network  first opened.  I had it taped, but the tape got destroyed.  If you are a  fan of 40's movies in general, you should like this.",912643200,6,412,5.34375
