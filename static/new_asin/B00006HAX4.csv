7968722,4,B00006HAX4,"This was Hugh Cornwell's last gig with the Stranglers, and he gives a fine performance, in good voice and with some swell guitar playing. The band, backed with horn section twitching and wriggling and with more lighting than a night shuttle launch, performs a representative sampler of its career:from ""No More Heroes"" and ""Hanging Around"" to ""Toiler"" and ""Nuclear Device"" to the later stuff, including ""Always the Sun."" The short length, sixty minutes, is about the only negative here. Good stuff.",1034035200,8,498,5.160493827160494
