3133030,4,B0014FAIYS,"The Sixth Season was always the 'infamous' one for Bewitched, whereas in England, they refer it to the 'Doctor Who' Season.  Basically because Darrin secretly 'regenerates' from Dick York to Dick Sargent. I always thought it was odd the actor replacing York had the same first name.  Which tells you about how strange things happen on Bewitched.

Ironically, the TLR (Time Lord Regeneration) Effect hit Bewitched with Louise Tate and Gladys Kravitz and apparently no one really seemed to care. The truth was as Lucille Ball originally wanted Gale Gordon as Fred Mertz, Sargent was first picked for Darrin due to his subtle wild expressions.  But regrettably, due to contractual obligations neither were available at the time.

The problem I believe was with the Sixth Season was not as so much the Darrin Regeneration Effect bugging audience members, but it seemed the writers loved added new characters and such through each episode.  Though there were some new stories written, others were simply modernized rehashes of classic York episodes but with a twist.

For instance whereas Endora splits Darrin's work side and fun side in the original York season of the show, it's because she wants Samantha to have fun.  But in the Sargent version, Endora pulls the same stunt again (ironically) to help 'Durwood' be with her daughter while still attending an important business meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, Alice Ghostley returned to the fold, but this time as Esmeralda, the housemaid with botched up magic.  As with Paul Lynde, Ghostley played a mortal character.  Except in a mysteriously ironic form, Ghostley played a bumbling housekeeper who Sam helps out when Louise needs a housekeeper for her party.

But I digress, as we know Esmeralda was essentially the replacement for Aunt Clara, except out of respect to Marion Lorre, she was written as a witch with dwindling powers, who's magic was set off by sneezing, or mishandled spells.

Then there came Adam, which of course, was to coincide with Elizabeth Montgomery's real pregnancy, and also helped bring charm to the show as Erin Murphy took over the role as Tabitha.

But the real gem of this Season was Serena getting Boyce and Hart for her Cotillion.  In 1969, apparently rock stars guesting on shows was a new staple for sitcoms, and Bewitched was no exception.  Of course, Montgomery shows off her talent as Serena when singing 'Blow You a Kiss in the Wind.'  An actual song this time composed for the episode, rather than the 'If'n Song,' Serena sang in the Fourth Season.

But strangely enough, the Sixth Season mysteriously held onto its viewers.  Though the new Darrin was taken with a grain of salt, the new characters and situations focusing also on Tabitha as well as Samantha kept them watching.

Even if you're not a fan of Sargent, the other characters keep the series going and prepared the ground work for the wild global-trotting Seventh Season. Definitely give this DVD Set worth a look, because even when The Doctor was forced to change, never really hurt his series none. Even with the Sixth Doctor (strange).

Who knew a witch, mortal and Time Lord had so much in common?",1209686400,11,3151,4.929924242424242
3133031,5,B0014FAIYS,"Yes, Darrin's actor has changed.  But I have to agree and say that Dick Sargent did as good a job as Dick York did (obviously, the show went on for three seasons with Sargent!)  I haven't seen all the episodes for season six, but I have seen a few of them.  From the description of the episodes, season six promises to be as good as seasons 1-5.  Thanks for finally releasing it, just don't forget that there are still two more great seasons!",1208822400,5,442,4.289156626506024
3133032,4,B0014FAIYS,"All my life I've listened to criticism of the differences between the two Darrins on Bewitched. Get over it people. Dick York got sick and couldn't do the show anymore...Live with it. Should we be deprived the joy of three more seasons on Samantha,Endora,Maurice and all the others because of the loss of York. I don't think so. I loved loved loved Dick York in the role and I admit that his loss was a great one but I feel Dick Sargent added his own magic to the role and I fully enjoyed his time on the show. If you can't deal with the change then don't buy the other seasons but don't trash a great actor because you can't deal with the change. I have loved the other seasons on DVD and am sure I will love this one too as well as the following two.",1208131200,12,752,4.122448979591836
3133033,2,B0014FAIYS,"During the first 5 season's, we had minor changes to the cast (a different actress playing Gladys Kravitz, a different actress playing Larry Tate's wife). These changes were not as good as the original actresses, but we made due. However, the changing of the main character husband, I just can't pretend not to notice. One of the things that made the show so good was the chemistry between Montgomery (as wife) and York (as husband). While the focus was Samantha's witchcraft, York was every bit important to the show as Montgomery (if not more). York's absense left a void that could not be filled by anyone else.",1208131200,22,614,4.747663551401869
3133034,5,B0014FAIYS,"I can not believe that there is only two more seasons left. I am sad that the original Darrin is gone. He was great. Now Adam, their son, is coming into the picture and also a new Darrin. I love this show so much. It's great for the whole family and everyone will love it. I have all five seasons and am super excited for the sixth to be in my hand.",1207440000,8,349,3.861111111111111
3133035,5,B0014FAIYS,"Opening the 6th Season (1969-1970) with Dick Sergeant, replacing Dick York, was going to be both challenging and somwhat of a gamble to see if fans of the show would continue to be entralled and in love with America's (and the world's!) favorite housewife witch!  With some of the most creative and memorable episodes, showcasing all of the actors talents, the season remained a favorite with fans! Here is a list of the 30 episodes in the Season 6 dvd set!

1 Samantha and the Beanstalk - As the 1969-1970 season begins, we are greeted by an all-new Darrin Stephens (Dick Sergeant). Tabitha is jealous of the new baby and decides to run away in the storybook of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". Phyllis (Darrin's Mother) sees Jack and is very confused about what is going on. Samantha finds out that Tabitha twitched herself into the storybook and goes in to get her back. She finds Tabitha shrinking the story's giant and messing up the entire story. Samantha tells Tabitha to put everything right back where she found it and brings her home.  A fun and entertaining first episode that kicks off Season 6, and gets the viewer ready for another magical season!

Darrin uses Esmerelda's magical goof-ups to good use when he presents a unicorn as a design for the client's car company. Samantha tells Darrin that Esmerelda will only visit when she is called.

3 Samantha's Caesar Salad - Samantha wants Esmerelda to make a Caesar salad, but ends up bringing Julius Caesar instead! Samantha wants him to go home, but Caesar does not want to leave the twentieth century. So Samantha pops up Cleopatra to lure Caesar back into his own time. Darrin's client sees these two figures together and decides to use these two in her beauty ad campaign.

4 Samantha's Curious Cravings - Whenever Samantha thinks of food, it appears in her hand. Dr. Bombay helps her out with her condition, but it doesn't work because now she goes to the food!

5 ...And Something Makes Four - Samantha gives birth to her second child, Adam!  Samantha's father,  Maurice makes sure that everyone who passes by falls in love with the baby.

Maurice freezes Darrin into a mirror until the baby's name is changed. Frank and Phyllis see Darrin in the mirror and think that it is a big moneymaker. After Frank states that he hates the name that was given to the baby, Maurice releases Darrin from the mirror. Darrin comes up with a name that sticks ""Adam"".

7 To Trick or Treat or Not to Trick or Treat - Samantha is working on Halloween costumes for a UNICEF benefit. Endora is dismayed at Samantha for celebrating Halloween.

8 A Bunny for Tabitha - At Tabitha's birthday party, Uncle Arthur volunteers to do tricks. He does a classic rabbit in a hat trick, and instead of a rabbit, he pulls out a Playboy bunny! Darrin's new client, A.J. Sylvester, comes to the party with Larry and instantly falls for Bunny. When A.J. and the bunny have lunch together, A.J.'s ex-girlfriend comes up, sees him and leaves in anger. Samantha invites A.J. and Bunny to dinner and A.J. announces that they are to be engaged.

She is ordered by Sam to get rid of her before Phyllis comes by. Phyllis comes by because of a marital spat he had with Frank and meets Mother Goose.

So, Tabitha blinks up an ice cream cone, and Samantha reprimands her for using her powers and sends her to her room. Tabitha decides to create her own ""Samantha"" and goes off to the park. Gladys sees them there and asks about Adam and gets no response. Gladys calls Darrin, who calls Samantha who doesn't know what is going on. Later, Tabitha gets a stomach ache from eating too much and confesses to her real mother. Seeing that Tabitha has learned her lesson, Samantha blinks away the fake ""mother"".

20 Super Arthur - Uncle Arthur's magic is going out of whack, and Dr. Bombay helps him out by giving him a pill. This pill, however, makes Arthur become anything he thinks off. After being transformed a few times, Samantha decides to take him outside for some air. Arthur states that he feels like Superman, and all of a sudden, he has a Superman suit and flies in the air! This cause major pandemonium in the neighborhood, and Samantha convinces Darrin and Larry that it is great campaign for a client they are working with.

24 The Generation Zap - With a touch of magic, Endora turns a client's sensible daughter Dusty Harrison into a raving sex machine with the hots for Darrin. Of course, Samantha is jealous and Mr. Harrison cancels his account. Darrin is mad at Endora, but recants when word gets out that Harrison is an embezzler.

25 Okay, Who's the Wise Witch? - Samantha, Darrin, Endora and Dr. Bombay are all caught in a magical vapor lock around the house due to Samantha's non-use of powers. How will they get out of this one?

26 A Chance on Love - Mr. Dinsdale, a handsome lady-killer client falls for Samantha because she looks like Serena. Samantha tries to get the whole thing straightened out, but it only results in Darrin losing his account. Dinsdale sees the truth for himself when Samantha and Serena come together.

27 If the Shoe Pinches - A leprechaun sent by (who else?) Endora wreaks havok on Darrin by making him wear a pear of mint shoes that makes him lazy. Samantha stops him by making a potion that controls him and all other lecrechauns.

28 Mona Sammi - A picture blinked up by Endora about Samantha gives Larry the impression that Darrin is a great artist and wants him to do a picture of Louise. Samantha helps Darrin out by giving him artistic magic to create a beautiful painting of Louise, but Endora zaps it to be the ugliest thing on earth!

29 Turn on the Old Charm - Endora? Can that really be you being nice to Darrin after all these years? Nah, it's an amulet that Darrin possesses that makes her nice and courteous. Endora knows better and makes Samantha and Darrin argue with each other. Their arguments take a serious toll when Darrin is threatened with the loss of an account by a greeting card company. Endora removes the spell and Samantha saves the account by suggesting that the greeting card company rep issue insults instead of poetry.

30 Make Love, Not Hate - Dr. Bombay's latest love potion for Esmerelda makes the people around her out of control with love when she accidentally pours it in her clam dip. Luckily, the good doctor comes up with an antidote before the house turns into an orgyfest!

The season opens with Samantha pregnant with Adam - and Tabitha zapping Jack (Johnny Whitaker) right off the beanstalk in her storyboard, so that she can take his place and give her parents the son she thinks they really want.  Other highlights: the introduction of Esmeralda (Alice Ghostley) as ""Samantha's Yoo-Hoo Maid"", the wonderful ""Samantha's Cravings"" episode where every time the pregnant Sam gets pregnant food zaps into her hands, and a brilliant Halloween episode where Endora, feeling Darrin is bigoted against witches, casts a spell that slowly turns him into one (and the makeup is actually kind of creepy on Sargent, to boot).  The second half of season six isn't always quite as strong, but you still have some great episodes - the vapor lock trapping everyone who pops into the house there, so that no one can leave ... Serena ruining the careers of pop singing act Boyce and Hart long enough to have them perform at the Cosmos Cotillion ... the Leonardo da Vinci portrait of Sam's look-a-like aunt causing the Tates to believe Darrin is a gifted artist they insist much paint Louise ... Samantha developing an unquenchable appetite for food after drinking a glass of milk hexed by Esmeralda ... even a terrific Henry Gibson playing a spitefully playful leprechaun engage by Endora to cause trouble.  So Sargent or not, this is a really good season ... and as I got it, new, for 78 cents plus shipping, not only worth it but a huge bargain!",1419292800,,1809,4.807073954983923

The funny episodes my family likes are the one where Endora casts a spell on Darrin to make him agreeable to all (I like how he gets out of a speeding ticket), another where a spell causes Darrin to speak in cliches.  Another funny one has Sam giving Darrin an amulet to ward off Endoras spells.  Watch for not one but 2 double sets of parents for Tabitha!  One episode has Darrin ""split in two"" and another Tabitha clones her mother and revises the cloned version to be all about Tabitha.  This series is put onto DVD well--there is a synopsis of episodes on each box--it helps to find the episode you're looking for--and it nicely put together-you can play one episode or run the DVD all through.

3133097,5,B0014FAIYS,"While not expecting much for this season compared to the previous seasons due to changing Darrin from Dick York to Dick Sargent, I thought both had their own individual character traits that were well written into the episodes. I had seen these episodes as reruns as a kid, but I see Bewitched in a whole new perspective as an adult that allows these classic shows to be timeless and a true family comedy the whole family can enjoy and relax to.

I only wish Sony would have kept the original Screen Gems logo at the end like they did in Seasons 7 & 8 and maybe have some of the promotional commercials from Chevrolet or other products advertised when these shows were originally broadcast as an added feature in the extras. The classic cars of that era were the best part of watching these episodes because of the fact that I grew up with those cars and I am a auto buff.

Glad that these classic shows are offered on DVD without commercials since I am not a fan of what is on TV today.

I also liked that these DVDs were one sided as opposed to many two sided DVDs that are easy to fingerprint or scratch since both sides are used to view. I also liked that the DVDs have individual locations in the case and are not stacked like multi-season DVDs.",1397606400,,1250,4.333333333333333

3133101,5,B0014FAIYS,"The first season with the new ""Darrin"", Dick Sargent, a new beginning and a new baby.  I remember looking forward to the premiere of this season when I was a kid, and, although I loved Dick York's Darrin, Dick Sargent eventually grew on me.  He wasn't nearly as frenetic as Dick York, he did as good a job as he could given who he was following.  A lot of reviews I've read here say that Dick Sargent was the original choice for Darrin but couldn't do it because of contractual obligations elsewhere.  While that is true, he wasn't Bill Asher or Elizabeth Montgomery's first choice when they chose the ""Bewitched"" project to work on together.  Dick Sargent was ABC's choice when they were in charge of the show, and wanted it to be a vehicle for popular stage actress, Tammy Grimes.  Tammy Grimes balked when she read the script and thought all the special effects would be too cumbersome and time-consuming and turned down the part.  Ironically, two years later in 1966, Tammy Grimes did star in a sitcom called the ""Tammy Grimes Show"" co-starring Dick Sargent as her brother!  Thank goodness she turned down ""Bewitched"".  Who else could've played Samantha Stephens as wonderfully as Elizabeth Montgomery???",1393804800,,1208,4.797101449275362
3133102,5,B0014FAIYS,Love the video season. I bought it used and it is in very good shape. Loved the show as a kid and still do.,1392076800,,107,3.5
3133103,5,B0014FAIYS,"I miss shows like this, although some of the different natured shows on the CW are very good. Thank you",1391212800,,103,4.2
3133104,3,B0014FAIYS,"And this after a Season 3 episode where Sam promised she could never zap up another Darrin Stephens. But here we are with Dick Sargent as the new ""Derwood."" I'll say right off the bat, that I don't hate Sargent. I don't hate anyone--not even Joe Besser as a stooge, but that's a different subject entirely.

Let's just say that while watching the Season 6 episodes, I have a hard time forgetting Dick York & how great he was in the role. It's even evident in the episodes where ""Darwin"" and Endora are going at it, that I just can't help think how fun it was to watch York & Agnes Moorehead go back and forth--whereas with Sargent & Agnes it just seems like petty sniping.

And the writers for the show definitely seem to start repeating themes more often than usual. That's usually the first sign of a sitcom in trouble--i.e. the first episode that Sargent actually filmed as the new Darrin, ""Samantha's Better Halves"" which was a remake of a classic Dick York episode from Season 2.

Also repeated from a past season is the idea of Sam's father Maurice giving Darrin a charm which will grant him magic powers. Of course, this idea was brought up in what was Dick York's final episode as Darrin in Season 5 and gets stretched out into a 2-part episode in year 6--where once again we see the familiar idea of Darrin getting intoxicated with magical powers.

Season 6 also gave us the new character of Esmeralda, a bumbling but well meaning witch whose powers are past their prime (sound familiar). Basically, Esmeralda was seemingly created with the idea of filling the void left by the late, great Marion Lorne who delighted viewers of the show as Aunt Clara for the first 4 years of Bewitched.

At least the producers of the show were smart enough not to try and call Alice Ghostley the new ""Aunt Clara."" Of course, I can't help but compare Esmeralda to Clara and Clara was irreplaceable. But, there are many who would say the same for the character of Darrin Stephens.

I don't mean to sound like I'm totally slamming this year of Bewitched. I'm a longtime fan of the show and loved (for the most part) the first 5 years of the show. Maybe by the time I get to Season 7 I'll have totally warmed up to the new ""Derwood."" To put it bluntly, Dick York ain't walking back into 1164 Morning Glory Circle & I may as well get used to it.",1390348800,2,2333,4.426573426573427

3133113,3,B0014FAIYS,"I was pretty disappointed with this season and not just because of the loss of Dick York. I don't recall one original story in this entire season, it all seemed really familiar. I did enjoy ""who's the wise witch"" and maybe a couple other episodes but for the most part there is nothing new.
I hate the stupid yoo hoo maid and I cringe when I hear Samantha yelling for her because I know what kind of episode it's going to be, she is definitely no aunt Clara. Another thing is we only see the Kravitz's and Louis Tate a couple times which sucks because I like those characters.
I also think Elizabeth Montgomery did a better job with Dick York. She seems to over act with Dick Sargent or maybe he just under acts and makes her look like she is hamming it up, I'm not sure but something is different with her character. She did the best job in the first two seasons and then in the first episode of season three you can tell a distinct difference in the way she portrayed the character. By the time this season rolls around she is really getting on my nerves and if I could speak to her I'd tell her to chill the &%$# out but let's not leave out Sargent just his voice is enough to irritate me.
If it were not for the supporting characters I don't think I would have made it through this season and I hope season seven is better as I'm off to start watching it now. (I am a fan of this show and bought all 8 seasons even if it doesn't sound like it)",1370563200,3,1447,4.11660777385159

3133128,5,B0014FAIYS,"And there are more than a few reasons for this.  Perhaps first and foremost is that Tabitha stars in a good number of epsides with both cute and hilarious results.  I always loved the Tabitha episodes even as a child.  Second reason this season is so great is the writing - the episodes are even more clever than I remember them and are  in many cases, better than those of earlier seasons.  Third reason this season is indispensible is that the year is now 1969 and it is so fun to watch ""the times"" going on in the background.. the hippies, the clothing styles, the attitudes.. you watch Bewitched season 6 and you get a small time window of 1969.  Can anybody say 'psychedelic'?  Many of these episodes could have been borrowed from an acid trip, and you can't help getting the feeling that maybe the writers had been doing a little dabbling themselves, it being 1969 and all.  Fourth reason this season rocks is Dick Sargent.  Dick York was the original Darrin and I really liked him too, though I couldn't help liking the energy that Dick Sargent seemed to bring out in Samantha.  Which brings us to the fifth reason this season rocks and that is Sam herself.  She's almost sexier than she's been in previous seasons.  Again, could've just been the times or maybe it was who she was playing off of as well.  There just seemed to be a little more chemistry between her and Dick Sargent, much as I hate to imply any disrespect to the original Darrin, Dick York.  York was a little more frenetic, overly worrisome at times, and hate to admit it but I find Sargent's less overly wrought countenance to bring a smoother energy to the show.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the first 5 seasons as well, although truth be told, I found things getting a little stale by the end of season 3 and half into season 4.  I personally put this Season 6 among my other two favorite seasons - the first and second.

Before watching it I actually didn't think this season would be that great - boy, was I wrong.  Perhaps men will have more to enjoy this season than women.  Elizibeth Montgomery as Samantha is not only ravishingly beautiful, but amazingly talented as well.  It's a gas watching her do far out Serena right beside herself as the ever wholesome Samantha.  I think I've found this season's Serena more interesting and entertaining than in previous seasons as well.  Don't think of this as season 6 - think of it as season 1969 and you're on the right track.  I'm looking forward to the next two seasons as this one was a wealth of treasures for a Bewitched fan who thought he'd seen the best of it seasons ago.",1348963200,,2612,4.4411764705882355

3133134,3,B0014FAIYS,"Dick York left in mid season of Bewitched.  However, the DVD only contains episodes with Dick Sargent.  One episode, not to be found anywhere, is the one where Endora, after Samantha and Darrin (one of the last played by Dick York) have a fight, convinces Samantha that she should see what would Darrin have done if he hadn't married Samantha.  In the end, as Darrin is celebrating the night before his funeral (I mean wedding) Samantha walks into his favorite bar as Darrin is exiting.  They bump into each other and he offers to buy her a drink,  He talks with her and implies that he is not in love with his finance.  He makes her promise not to leave the bar and tells the bar tender to not let her out of his sight as he is about to call off the wedding and continue his date with Samantha.  In the end, Darrin comes home and apologizes to Samantha.  So we have lost some episodes of Bewitched and that is sad.  TV Land doesn't even show the whole season and I don't now why they cut certain episodes out.  As least we should have them offered to us in the DVD format.  I do hope they provide a new DVD with the episodes they have removed.

3133143,5,B0014FAIYS,"There are plenty of us who were delighted to get rid of the raving, abusive lunatic Darrin #1 played by Dick York. He soured the milk (and our stomachs) every time he was on the screen. His raving seemed a bit too natural for him than just acting. We couldn't have been more happy to be rid of him.

We felt bad about York's back injury and sorry he had to go through that suffering which cost him his acting career... but it still doesn't change the fact that a lot of us were glad to see Dick Sargent in his place.

This was the season which set the character Samantha free of the raving and brought in a softer, more gentle, kinder Darrin #2 played by Dick Sargent. It was also the season when we stopped getting sour stomachs from York's raving and ranting.

Once you have lived around or been subjected to a raving, abusive control freak like Darrin #1 in real life... you would understand how horrible it is to be around someone like that 365 days a year. So there was no pleasure in watching a TV show featuring a creep like that. If not for the characters of Samantha and Endora plus the entertaining magical nature of the series... the offensive nature of his condescending, overbearing, chauvinistic, controlling, raving, abuse as portrayed by York would have driven off many of the viewers. The writers also hold some responsibility of the offensive nature of York's character... but York's abusive, ranting demeanor went way beyond the script. He reveled in it.

While we wouldn't have wished York's bad back on anyone, it was the reason York finally left... otherwise there would have been 3 more seasons of York and we never would have had the pleasure of watching Darrin #2 Dick Sargent.

PS: It was interesting to learn that Erin (the actress who played Tabitha) is currently married to a man (In real life) named, Darren.",1248998400,,1838,4.574468085106383
3133144,3,B0014FAIYS,"I can't say I was delighted with this season. I never did like the new Darrin even if he was supposed to have the role in the first place and secondly, the writting was stale. It's like serving a beef wellington every night. It get's old after awhile.
It was very easy to pick up director and producer want's in this show. It came out badly as it did in the last season as well problem is- when the writting is bad anyway don't keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Maybe this show was great for it's time but after the first three seasons watching it is like watching a light house turn around and around and around. Same thing over and over again.
Maybe the show was great for it's time but the Dick Van Dyke show was before this show and it had original story and plot lines.
The saving grace (if any) for this show was Anges Moorehead. She brings sparkle to an other wise dreary script. You could make her say the same thing 100 times over (which they basically do) and she makes it sound like new!",1243209600,2,1018,4.225641025641026

3133146,5,B0014FAIYS,"Season 6 of Bewitched is a great DVD.  Dick Sargent's Darrin seems much more affectionate toward Samantha.  I noticed how almost every episode ended with a long kiss.  It seemed like the Sargent-Montgomery chemistry was greater.  My favorite episode of the season is ""Who's the Wise Witch"" where Samantha's lack of magic creates a vapor lock on the house.  First Endora then Esmeralda then Dr. Bombay get trapped inside the house.  One wonders how many witches are going to get locked in before Bombay's delightful solution.  Tommy Boyce & Bobby Hart's appearance was also a lot of fun in ""Serena Stops the Show.""  Alice Ghostly was a favorite of mine from the Jackie Gleason Show as the fiancee who'd been engaged for over a decade.  Her addition to the cast as Esmeralda was endearing.  Agnes Moorehead continued her delightful Endora.  Carol Wayne's appearance as a bunny was dingy & sweet.  My sense is that the show was reenergized in Season 6.  Enjoy!",1239235200,3,957,4.833333333333333
3133147,5,B0014FAIYS,"""Bewitched"" changed on many fronts in its 6th season, 1969-1970. The most obvious change was the replacement of Dick York by Dick Sargent as Darren. York had a serious back problem that kept him from working, and facing pressure from ABC, both Liz Montgomery and Bill Asher had no choice but to replace him. This was also the year the Ashers made Ashmont Productions. This compnay would go on to produce the remaining years of ""Bewitched"". At the end of the 5th season Elizabeth and William Asher wanted to close production, but ABC, not wanting to lose a hit show, gave them part ownership of the series and huge salary increases.
 Another change was the show's opening. There is new animation featuring Samantha on her broom, along with the new ""Darren"", and we now have an announcer saying, ""Elizabeth Montgomery in...""Bewitched"""".
 30 episodes are included with this boxset and they look clean and crisp as if they were made yesterday. However, the scripts this season started to wane, as they are not as innovative and original as the five previous seasons. Still, if you are an ardent ""Bewitched"" fan, like me, pick up this season to help complete your collection.
 On a final note, since Marion Lorne had died it was important to have a ""dumb"" witch on the show. Alice Ghostley appears this season as Esmeralda, a witch with weak powers who fades whenever she gets nervous. Her performance is both funny and outrageous.
 On a sad note, this was also the year ""Bewitched"" lost a substantial portion of their audience. This was due to the recast of a major player in the series. The show finished at #25, after being at #12 the previous year: a loss of many million viewers. The final Nielsen ratings for the 1969-1970 season was a 20.6.",1238976000,9,1742,4.720394736842105

For me neither of them made much of a difference. The best scenes for me were always centered around Endora, Samantha, and Tabitha. The three actresses were so good and funny together that he almost wasn't even needed. Endora's endless spells on Darren started getting old and boring. Another new charactor was Esmeralda a bumbling witch now that Clara was gone (the actress who played her passed away). This didn't work for me.

3133156,5,B0014FAIYS,"After viewing ""Bewitched"" the 6th season I am still impressed by how simple good creative entertainment can be.  Elizabeth Montgomery shows her talent as a comedienne in every episode and provides good fun for any age or taste.  The endless conflicts for Darren vs. the Magic World and its cast of endless tormentors for him in infinitly tormenting situations is worth the money to get and show over and over again.",1215907200,3,415,4.830985915492958

3133158,5,B0014FAIYS,"I know Dick Sargent is not Dick York, but I think he did a very fine job replacing a quite popular actor.  The show had no choice but to replace Dick York who was so physically incapacitated that he could not do the show anymore.  I would much rather have had them replace Dick York than to not have Bewitched at all.  I would not have wanted to miss Adam, the now talking and animated Tabatha, or more Bewitched magic.  Sometimes we humans have to take a lesson from the animals and just adapt.  I have season 6 and love it as much as I did the other five seasons.  I intend to eventually have a complete set.
Thank you for continuing to make this series available.

3133165,4,B0014FAIYS,"After a  shaky Season Five, the magic is back on track for a delightful  and enchanting Season Six of ""Bewitched."" Dick York was in terrible physical pain throughout his five year run; and he just couldn't continue on the show anymore. It is sad, but it is a fact, people. I wish ""fans"" would show Dick Sargent more respect. Dick Sargent did a wonderful job as well; and the show DID NOT ""jump the broomstick"" when Sargent took over the role of Darrin.  Does anyone else notice how ATTRACTIVE Dick Sargent is? He and Elizabeth Montgomery developed their own special chemistry and formed a wonderful friendship that lasted until Sargent's death in 1994. Sadly, Elizabeth Montgomery died in 1995.
  I'm not going  to get into the ""Dick York Vs. Dick Sargent"" debate; which  I've always regarded as pointless and stupid. I'll just say that Dick York as Darrin always seemed to me to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown because of Samantha's witchcraft, while Dick Sargent was exasperated by it. The transition between the two actors was handeled so subtly and smoothly as to be almost inperceptible.  The series picks up exactly where it was. Towards the end of Season 5, Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)  tells an absent Darrin over the phone that she is pregnant in ""Samantha's Good News."" At the beginning of the Season Six Opener, ""Samantha & The Beanstalk,"" Samantha is painting a crib, asking Darrin what they should name the new baby. Feeling unwanted, Tabitha (Erin Murphy) switches places with fairy tale's Jack (""Family Affair's Johnny Whittaker) and Samantha climbs up the beanstalk after her.
  Although a few plots are ""recycled"" ideas, that is actually a common practice on any long-running Series, and few shows remain as endearing or enduring as ""Bewitched."" (the 30 episodes of Season Six are Episodes #171-#200 in the Series). The excellent ""Bewitched"" writers deserve kudos and praise for keeping the basic premise so fresh and fun throughout numerous and varied production changes. The  Series quality and creativity remained high throughout Season Seven.  As another reviewer so astutely pointed out, boredom  DID NOT set in until Season Eight, the final season. But there is  no need to jump ahead or despair here.
  Season Six is especially busy and fun. Alice Ghostley (who guest-starred as maid Naomi in ""Maid To Order"" in Season Two) joins the cast as maid Esmeralda, a shy, slightly neurotic witch who keeps fading in and out. Marion Lorne, who portrayed the beloved Aunt Clara, died at the end of Season Four. Producers wanted a new character who would also ""mess up the magic"" as Clara had done-- hence, Esmeralda was created. In ""Samantha's Curious Cravings"", a very pregnant Samantha magically receives any food she thinks about. When Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox) attempts to remedy the situation, Samantha disappears whenever she thinks about food, and ""pops over"" to wherever the food is. In a related episode, the outstanding and hilarious ""Samantha's Lost Weekend,"" Samantha accidentally drinks a glass of ""magic"" milk, and can't stop eating! I always wondered if Elizabeth Montgomery had fun filming this particular episode-- because it certainly is great fun to watch! Baby Adam is born, leading to more feelings of rejection by Tabitha; which is the plot of another memorable episode titled ""Tabitha's Very Own Samantha.""
  Besides Jack & The Beanstalk, other ""house guests"" in Season Six include Julius Ceasar, The Artful Dodger, Mother Goose, and Santa Claus! After two previous visits to the North Pole, Santa (Ronald Long) and all of his Elves are stranded at Samantha and Darrin's house! Henry Gibson makes a memorable guest appearance as a mischievous leprechaun sent by Endora (Agnes Moorehead) to wreck havoc in the episode ""If The Shoe Pinches."" Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde), Daddy Maurice (Maurice Evans) and wild Cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery's other delicious Series role) also add to the fun and merriment of Season Six. After all these decades, from child to adult, ""Bewitched"" ALWAYS brings a smile to my face.",1210204800,6,4061,5.061469265367316
3133166,5,B0014FAIYS,"O.k., o.k., maybe I'm in the minority but I can't be the only person who preferred Dick Sargeant's Darrin to Dick York.  Dick York was too neuroticly played which annoyed me at times to no end.  It was hard for me to sympathize with him when Endora cast her spells on him.  Who could blame her??
  Not so with Sargeant.  Sargeant is not only better looking and sexier than York, but it is a well-known fact that Elizabeth Montgomery herself preferred him to York.  Not to mention they had excellent chemistry.  Sargeant also brings a dry wit to Darrin which York did not do.  Its much easier for me to identify with him.
  Now that that is overwith, let's get to Season Six.  This is a step up from Season Five, which because of York's illness, Darrin was missing in many episodes.  The season has some refreshingly fun episodes such as Serena singing ""I'll Blow You a Kiss in the Wind"" with Boyce and Hart, Darrin acting out cliche's, Samantha going on eating binges and the introduction of ""Yoo-Hoo Esmerelda"" and a very funny episode about the ""Mona Lisa"".
  The series had plenty of life left in it and it is a season which will disappoint no real Bewitched aficionados. Only two seasons to go for this classic series!!",1210204800,15,1223,4.52054794520548
3367527,4,B0014FAIYS,"The Sixth Season was always the 'infamous' one for Bewitched, whereas in England, they refer it to the 'Doctor Who' Season.  Basically because Darrin secretly 'regenerates' from Dick York to Dick Sargent. I always thought it was odd the actor replacing York had the same first name.  Which tells you about how strange things happen on Bewitched.

Ironically, the TLR (Time Lord Regeneration) Effect hit Bewitched with Louise Tate and Gladys Kravitz and apparently no one really seemed to care. The truth was as Lucille Ball originally wanted Gale Gordon as Fred Mertz, Sargent was first picked for Darrin due to his subtle wild expressions.  But regrettably, due to contractual obligations neither were available at the time.

The problem I believe was with the Sixth Season was not as so much the Darrin Regeneration Effect bugging audience members, but it seemed the writers loved added new characters and such through each episode.  Though there were some new stories written, others were simply modernized rehashes of classic York episodes but with a twist.

For instance whereas Endora splits Darrin's work side and fun side in the original York season of the show, it's because she wants Samantha to have fun.  But in the Sargent version, Endora pulls the same stunt again (ironically) to help 'Durwood' be with her daughter while still attending an important business meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, Alice Ghostley returned to the fold, but this time as Esmeralda, the housemaid with botched up magic.  As with Paul Lynde, Ghostley played a mortal character.  Except in a mysteriously ironic form, Ghostley played a bumbling housekeeper who Sam helps out when Louise needs a housekeeper for her party.

But I digress, as we know Esmeralda was essentially the replacement for Aunt Clara, except out of respect to Marion Lorre, she was written as a witch with dwindling powers, who's magic was set off by sneezing, or mishandled spells.

Then there came Adam, which of course, was to coincide with Elizabeth Montgomery's real pregnancy, and also helped bring charm to the show as Erin Murphy took over the role as Tabitha.

But the real gem of this Season was Serena getting Boyce and Hart for her Cotillion.  In 1969, apparently rock stars guesting on shows was a new staple for sitcoms, and Bewitched was no exception.  Of course, Montgomery shows off her talent as Serena when singing 'Blow You a Kiss in the Wind.'  An actual song this time composed for the episode, rather than the 'If'n Song,' Serena sang in the Fourth Season.

But strangely enough, the Sixth Season mysteriously held onto its viewers.  Though the new Darrin was taken with a grain of salt, the new characters and situations focusing also on Tabitha as well as Samantha kept them watching.

Even if you're not a fan of Sargent, the other characters keep the series going and prepared the ground work for the wild global-trotting Seventh Season. Definitely give this DVD Set worth a look, because even when The Doctor was forced to change, never really hurt his series none. Even with the Sixth Doctor (strange).

Who knew a witch, mortal and Time Lord had so much in common?",1209686400,11,3151,4.929924242424242
3367528,5,B0014FAIYS,"Yes, Darrin's actor has changed.  But I have to agree and say that Dick Sargent did as good a job as Dick York did (obviously, the show went on for three seasons with Sargent!)

I don't think so. I loved loved loved Dick York in the role and I admit that his loss was a great one but I feel Dick Sargent added his own magic to the role and I fully enjoyed his time on the show.

One of the things that made the show so good was the chemistry between Montgomery (as wife) and York (as husband). While the focus was Samantha's witchcraft, York was every bit important to the show as Montgomery (if not more).

With some of the most creative and memorable episodes, showcasing all of the actors talents, the season remained a favorite with fans! Here is a list of the 30 episodes in the Season 6 dvd set!

Samantha tells Tabitha to put everything right back where she found it and brings her home.  A fun and entertaining first episode that kicks off Season 6, and gets the viewer ready for another magical season!

2 Samantha's Yoo-Hoo Maid - A year after Aunt Clara passed on, Esmerelda carries on her memory by being a bumbling witch as well.

Maurice freezes Darrin into a mirror until the baby's name is changed. Frank and Phyllis see Darrin in the mirror and think that it is a big moneymaker. After Frank states that he hates the name that was given to the baby, Maurice releases Darrin from the mirror. Darrin comes up with a name that sticks ""Adam"".

7 To Trick or Treat or Not to Trick or Treat - Samantha is working on Halloween costumes for a UNICEF benefit. Endora is dismayed at Samantha for celebrating Halloween. Endora turns Darrin into a witch to get him to see the disrespect of witches on Halloween. After getting into a lot of trouble with his appearance, Darrin apologizes to Endora and she removes the spell.

8 A Bunny for Tabitha - At Tabitha's birthday party, Uncle Arthur volunteers to do tricks. He does a classic rabbit in a hat trick, and instead of a rabbit, he pulls out a Playboy bunny! Darrin's new client, A.J. Sylvester, comes to the party with Larry and instantly falls for Bunny. When A.J. and the bunny have lunch together, A.J.'s ex-girlfriend comes up, sees him and leaves in anger. Samantha invites A.J. and Bunny to dinner and A.J. announces that they are to be engaged. But that doesn't last long when Bunny's rabbit qualities finally come to light.

11 Darrin the Warlock (2) - Darrin has a ball with his newfound magical powers. With his powers, Darrin creates a stellar account with his client, Bliss, Jr. and shows Larry his powers. It isn't until Darrin meets his old friend, Dave, and decides to give up his magic.

12 Sam's Double Mother Trouble - Esmerelda is reading Mother Goose to Tabitha, and ends up sneezing up the real Mother Goose in question. She is ordered by Sam to get rid of her before Phyllis comes by. Phyllis comes by because of a marital spat he had with Frank and meets Mother Goose. Then Frank comes by and Phyllis runs up the stairs. While he is having a talk with Mother Goose, Darrin and Samantha try to tell Phyllis to go back to Frank.

13 You're So Agreeable - Endora puts a spell on Darrin, making him agreeable to everything and everyone. Of course, this results in him getting fired from McMann and Tate. Samantha finds out about the spell and tells her mother to take it off.

14 Santa Comes to Visit and Stays and Stays - Esmerelda brings up the real Santa Claus and cannot get him back to the North Pole. So Samantha blinks up his elves and sleigh and reindeer, much to the horror of Gladys, who instantly reports all that she sees to Abner, who does not listen to her.

15 Samantha's Better Halves - Samantha and Darrin have a flashback. Darrin has to go to Japan to do business with a client, but cannot leave Samantha's side when her baby is due. Endora breaks Darrin into two people: the fun Darrin and the business Darrin, with strange and hilarious results.

19 Tabitha's Very Own Samantha - Tabitha wants to go to the park, but Samantha tells her that she has a lot of chores to do around the house. So, Tabitha blinks up an ice cream cone, and Samantha reprimands her for using her powers and sends her to her room. Tabitha decides to create her own ""Samantha"" and goes off to the park. Gladys sees them there and asks about Adam and gets no response. Gladys calls Darrin, who calls Samantha who doesn't know what is going on. Later, Tabitha gets a stomach ache from eating too much and confesses to her real mother. Seeing that Tabitha has learned her lesson, Samantha blinks away the fake ""mother"".

20 Super Arthur - Uncle Arthur's magic is going out of whack, and Dr. Bombay helps him out by giving him a pill. This pill, however, makes Arthur become anything he thinks off. After being transformed a few times, Samantha decides to take him outside for some air. Arthur states that he feels like Superman, and all of a sudden, he has a Superman suit and flies in the air! This cause major pandemonium in the neighborhood, and Samantha convinces Darrin and Larry that it is great campaign for a client they are working with.

21 What Makes Darrin Run? - To give Darrin more ambition, Endora puts a spell on him giving him the push and verve that he needs. He takes it a bit too far when he takes control over an account and he and Larry was working on together. Darrin then has no time for Samantha or the children because of this spell and Samantha gets through to him by telling him that he is under a spell and to undo the damage he caused.

22 Serena Stops the Show - Serena wants Boyce and Hart to play at the Cosmos Cotillion, but they are booked ""until 1976"". Serena puts a spell on them to make them unpopular until they perform at the cotillion and sing her song. Once they perform at the Cotillion, Samantha insists Serena remove the spell.

23 Just a Kid Again - A store clerk named Bates wishes that he was a child again. Tabitha makes his wish come true when it actually happens. When Samantha finds out, she makes Tabitha take the spell off of him, but he likes being a kid. Then, Bates finds out that his girlfriend is about to go out with her boss, and proves his love for her by kicking her boss. He decides that he doesn't want to be a kid anymore, and the spell is broken.

24 The Generation Zap - With a touch of magic, Endora turns a client's sensible daughter Dusty Harrison into a raving sex machine with the hots for Darrin. Of course, Samantha is jealous and Mr. Harrison cancels his account. Darrin is mad at Endora, but recants when word gets out that Harrison is an embezzler.

25 Okay, Who's the Wise Witch? - Samantha, Darrin, Endora and Dr. Bombay are all caught in a magical vapor lock around the house due to Samantha's non-use of powers. How will they get out of this one?

26 A Chance on Love - Mr. Dinsdale, a handsome lady-killer client falls for Samantha because she looks like Serena. Samantha tries to get the whole thing straightened out, but it only results in Darrin losing his account. Dinsdale sees the truth for himself when Samantha and Serena come together.

27 If the Shoe Pinches - A leprechaun sent by (who else?) Endora wreaks havok on Darrin by making him wear a pear of mint shoes that makes him lazy. Samantha stops him by making a potion that controls him and all other lecrechauns.

28 Mona Sammi - A picture blinked up by Endora about Samantha gives Larry the impression that Darrin is a great artist and wants him to do a picture of Louise. Samantha helps Darrin out by giving him artistic magic to create a beautiful painting of Louise, but Endora zaps it to be the ugliest thing on earth!

29 Turn on the Old Charm - Endora? Can that really be you being nice to Darrin after all these years? Nah, it's an amulet that Darrin possesses that makes her nice and courteous. Endora knows better and makes Samantha and Darrin argue with each other. Their arguments take a serious toll when Darrin is threatened with the loss of an account by a greeting card company. Endora removes the spell and Samantha saves the account by suggesting that the greeting card company rep issue insults instead of poetry.

30 Make Love, Not Hate - Dr. Bombay's latest love potion for Esmerelda makes the people around her out of control with love when she accidentally pours it in her clam dip. Luckily, the good doctor comes up with an antidote before the house turns into an orgyfest!

3367569,4,B0014FAIYS,"Dick Sargent may not have been Dick York (seriously, gay or not in real life, when Sargent kisses Elizabeth Montgomery in their scenes, he just looks like he mashing his face into hers; York and Montgomery, you really felt the affection!), but his first season as ""Durwood"" actually has some strong episodes - including a few favorites of the series.  The season opens with Samantha pregnant with Adam - and Tabitha zapping Jack (Johnny Whitaker) right off the beanstalk in her storyboard, so that she can take his place and give her parents the son she thinks they really want.  Other highlights: the introduction of Esmeralda (Alice Ghostley) as ""Samantha's Yoo-Hoo Maid"", the wonderful ""Samantha's Cravings"" episode where every time the pregnant Sam gets pregnant food zaps into her hands, and a brilliant Halloween episode where Endora, feeling Darrin is bigoted against witches, casts a spell that slowly turns him into one (and the makeup is actually kind of creepy on Sargent, to boot).  The second half of season six isn't always quite as strong, but you still have some great episodes - the vapor lock trapping everyone who pops into the house there, so that no one can leave ... Serena ruining the careers of pop singing act Boyce and Hart long enough to have them perform at the Cosmos Cotillion ... the Leonardo da Vinci portrait of Sam's look-a-like aunt causing the Tates to believe Darrin is a gifted artist they insist much paint Louise ... Samantha developing an unquenchable appetite for food after drinking a glass of milk hexed by Esmeralda ... even a terrific Henry Gibson playing a spitefully playful leprechaun engage by Endora to cause trouble.  So Sargent or not, this is a really good season ... and as I got it, new, for 78 cents plus shipping, not only worth it but a huge bargain!",1419292800,,1809,4.807073954983923

The funny episodes my family likes are the one where Endora casts a spell on Darrin to make him agreeable to all (I like how he gets out of a speeding ticket), another where a spell causes Darrin to speak in cliches.  Another funny one has Sam giving Darrin an amulet to ward off Endoras spells.  Watch for not one but 2 double sets of parents for Tabitha!  One episode has Darrin ""split in two"" and another Tabitha clones her mother and revises the cloned version to be all about Tabitha.  This series is put onto DVD well--there is a synopsis of episodes on each box--it helps to find the episode you're looking for--and it nicely put together-you can play one episode or run the DVD all through.

3367594,5,B0014FAIYS,"While not expecting much for this season compared to the previous seasons due to changing Darrin from Dick York to Dick Sargent, I thought both had their own individual character traits that were well written into the episodes. I had seen these episodes as reruns as a kid, but I see Bewitched in a whole new perspective as an adult that allows these classic shows to be timeless and a true family comedy the whole family can enjoy and relax to.

I only wish Sony would have kept the original Screen Gems logo at the end like they did in Seasons 7 & 8 and maybe have some of the promotional commercials from Chevrolet or other products advertised when these shows were originally broadcast as an added feature in the extras. The classic cars of that era were the best part of watching these episodes because of the fact that I grew up with those cars and I am a auto buff.

Glad that these classic shows are offered on DVD without commercials since I am not a fan of what is on TV today.

I also liked that these DVDs were one sided as opposed to many two sided DVDs that are easy to fingerprint or scratch since both sides are used to view. I also liked that the DVDs have individual locations in the case and are not stacked like multi-season DVDs.",1397606400,,1250,4.333333333333333

3367598,5,B0014FAIYS,"The first season with the new ""Darrin"", Dick Sargent, a new beginning and a new baby.  I remember looking forward to the premiere of this season when I was a kid, and, although I loved Dick York's Darrin, Dick Sargent eventually grew on me.  He wasn't nearly as frenetic as Dick York, he did as good a job as he could given who he was following.  A lot of reviews I've read here say that Dick Sargent was the original choice for Darrin but couldn't do it because of contractual obligations elsewhere.  While that is true, he wasn't Bill Asher or Elizabeth Montgomery's first choice when they chose the ""Bewitched"" project to work on together.  Dick Sargent was ABC's choice when they were in charge of the show, and wanted it to be a vehicle for popular stage actress, Tammy Grimes.  Tammy Grimes balked when she read the script and thought all the special effects would be too cumbersome and time-consuming and turned down the part.  Ironically, two years later in 1966, Tammy Grimes did star in a sitcom called the ""Tammy Grimes Show"" co-starring Dick Sargent as her brother!  Thank goodness she turned down ""Bewitched"".  Who else could've played Samantha Stephens as wonderfully as Elizabeth Montgomery???",1393804800,,1208,4.797101449275362
3367599,5,B0014FAIYS,Love the video season. I bought it used and it is in very good shape. Loved the show as a kid and still do.,1392076800,,107,3.5
3367600,5,B0014FAIYS,"I miss shows like this, although some of the different natured shows on the CW are very good. Thank you",1391212800,,103,4.2
3367601,3,B0014FAIYS,"And this after a Season 3 episode where Sam promised she could never zap up another Darrin Stephens. But here we are with Dick Sargent as the new ""Derwood."" I'll say right off the bat, that I don't hate Sargent. I don't hate anyone--not even Joe Besser as a stooge, but that's a different subject entirely.

Let's just say that while watching the Season 6 episodes, I have a hard time forgetting Dick York & how great he was in the role. It's even evident in the episodes where ""Darwin"" and Endora are going at it, that I just can't help think how fun it was to watch York & Agnes Moorehead go back and forth--whereas with Sargent & Agnes it just seems like petty sniping.

And the writers for the show definitely seem to start repeating themes more often than usual. That's usually the first sign of a sitcom in trouble--i.e. the first episode that Sargent actually filmed as the new Darrin, ""Samantha's Better Halves"" which was a remake of a classic Dick York episode from Season 2.

Also repeated from a past season is the idea of Sam's father Maurice giving Darrin a charm which will grant him magic powers. Of course, this idea was brought up in what was Dick York's final episode as Darrin in Season 5 and gets stretched out into a 2-part episode in year 6--where once again we see the familiar idea of Darrin getting intoxicated with magical powers.

Season 6 also gave us the new character of Esmeralda, a bumbling but well meaning witch whose powers are past their prime (sound familiar). Basically, Esmeralda was seemingly created with the idea of filling the void left by the late, great Marion Lorne who delighted viewers of the show as Aunt Clara for the first 4 years of Bewitched.

At least the producers of the show were smart enough not to try and call Alice Ghostley the new ""Aunt Clara."" Of course, I can't help but compare Esmeralda to Clara and Clara was irreplaceable. But, there are many who would say the same for the character of Darrin Stephens.

I don't mean to sound like I'm totally slamming this year of Bewitched. I'm a longtime fan of the show and loved (for the most part) the first 5 years of the show. Maybe by the time I get to Season 7 I'll have totally warmed up to the new ""Derwood."" To put it bluntly, Dick York ain't walking back into 1164 Morning Glory Circle & I may as well get used to it.",1390348800,2,2333,4.426573426573427

I was so glad that I was able to watch during the year this show came out.,1375315200,,305,4.016393442622951

3367610,3,B0014FAIYS,"I was pretty disappointed with this season and not just because of the loss of Dick York. I don't recall one original story in this entire season, it all seemed really familiar. I did enjoy ""who's the wise witch"" and maybe a couple other episodes but for the most part there is nothing new.
I hate the stupid yoo hoo maid and I cringe when I hear Samantha yelling for her because I know what kind of episode it's going to be, she is definitely no aunt Clara. Another thing is we only see the Kravitz's and Louis Tate a couple times which sucks because I like those characters.
I also think Elizabeth Montgomery did a better job with Dick York. She seems to over act with Dick Sargent or maybe he just under acts and makes her look like she is hamming it up, I'm not sure but something is different with her character. She did the best job in the first two seasons and then in the first episode of season three you can tell a distinct difference in the way she portrayed the character. By the time this season rolls around she is really getting on my nerves and if I could speak to her I'd tell her to chill the &%$# out but let's not leave out Sargent just his voice is enough to irritate me.
If it were not for the supporting characters I don't think I would have made it through this season and I hope season seven is better as I'm off to start watching it now. (I am a fan of this show and bought all 8 seasons even if it doesn't sound like it)",1370563200,3,1447,4.11660777385159

3367625,5,B0014FAIYS,"And there are more than a few reasons for this.  Perhaps first and foremost is that Tabitha stars in a good number of epsides with both cute and hilarious results.  I always loved the Tabitha episodes even as a child.  Second reason this season is so great is the writing - the episodes are even more clever than I remember them and are  in many cases, better than those of earlier seasons.  Third reason this season is indispensible is that the year is now 1969 and it is so fun to watch ""the times"" going on in the background.. the hippies, the clothing styles, the attitudes.. you watch Bewitched season 6 and you get a small time window of 1969.  Can anybody say 'psychedelic'?  Many of these episodes could have been borrowed from an acid trip, and you can't help getting the feeling that maybe the writers had been doing a little dabbling themselves, it being 1969 and all.  Fourth reason this season rocks is Dick Sargent.  Dick York was the original Darrin and I really liked him too, though I couldn't help liking the energy that Dick Sargent seemed to bring out in Samantha.  Which brings us to the fifth reason this season rocks and that is Sam herself.  She's almost sexier than she's been in previous seasons.  Again, could've just been the times or maybe it was who she was playing off of as well.  There just seemed to be a little more chemistry between her and Dick Sargent, much as I hate to imply any disrespect to the original Darrin, Dick York.  York was a little more frenetic, overly worrisome at times, and hate to admit it but I find Sargent's less overly wrought countenance to bring a smoother energy to the show.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the first 5 seasons as well, although truth be told, I found things getting a little stale by the end of season 3 and half into season 4.  I personally put this Season 6 among my other two favorite seasons - the first and second.

Before watching it I actually didn't think this season would be that great - boy, was I wrong.  Perhaps men will have more to enjoy this season than women.  Elizibeth Montgomery as Samantha is not only ravishingly beautiful, but amazingly talented as well.  It's a gas watching her do far out Serena right beside herself as the ever wholesome Samantha.  I think I've found this season's Serena more interesting and entertaining than in previous seasons as well.  Don't think of this as season 6 - think of it as season 1969 and you're on the right track.  I'm looking forward to the next two seasons as this one was a wealth of treasures for a Bewitched fan who thought he'd seen the best of it seasons ago.",1348963200,,2612,4.4411764705882355
3367626,3,B0014FAIYS,"Some of the episodes in this are a bit silly. But the acting of agnes, maurice, David White and surprisingly dick sargent overcomes this.

3367631,3,B0014FAIYS,"Dick York left in mid season of Bewitched.  However, the DVD only contains episodes with Dick Sargent.  One episode, not to be found anywhere, is the one where Endora, after Samantha and Darrin (one of the last played by Dick York) have a fight, convinces Samantha that she should see what would Darrin have done if he hadn't married Samantha.  In the end, as Darrin is celebrating the night before his funeral (I mean wedding) Samantha walks into his favorite bar as Darrin is exiting.  They bump into each other and he offers to buy her a drink,  He talks with her and implies that he is not in love with his finance.  He makes her promise not to leave the bar and tells the bar tender to not let her out of his sight as he is about to call off the wedding and continue his date with Samantha.  In the end, Darrin comes home and apologizes to Samantha.  So we have lost some episodes of Bewitched and that is sad.  TV Land doesn't even show the whole season and I don't now why they cut certain episodes out.  As least we should have them offered to us in the DVD format.  I do hope they provide a new DVD with the episodes they have removed.

3367640,5,B0014FAIYS,"There are plenty of us who were delighted to get rid of the raving, abusive lunatic Darrin #1 played by Dick York. He soured the milk (and our stomachs) every time he was on the screen. His raving seemed a bit too natural for him than just acting. We couldn't have been more happy to be rid of him.

We felt bad about York's back injury and sorry he had to go through that suffering which cost him his acting career... but it still doesn't change the fact that a lot of us were glad to see Dick Sargent in his place.

This was the season which set the character Samantha free of the raving and brought in a softer, more gentle, kinder Darrin #2 played by Dick Sargent. It was also the season when we stopped getting sour stomachs from York's raving and ranting.

Once you have lived around or been subjected to a raving, abusive control freak like Darrin #1 in real life... you would understand how horrible it is to be around someone like that 365 days a year. So there was no pleasure in watching a TV show featuring a creep like that. If not for the characters of Samantha and Endora plus the entertaining magical nature of the series... the offensive nature of his condescending, overbearing, chauvinistic, controlling, raving, abuse as portrayed by York would have driven off many of the viewers. The writers also hold some responsibility of the offensive nature of York's character... but York's abusive, ranting demeanor went way beyond the script. He reveled in it.

While we wouldn't have wished York's bad back on anyone, it was the reason York finally left... otherwise there would have been 3 more seasons of York and we never would have had the pleasure of watching Darrin #2 Dick Sargent.

PS: It was interesting to learn that Erin (the actress who played Tabitha) is currently married to a man (In real life) named, Darren.",1248998400,,1838,4.574468085106383
3367641,3,B0014FAIYS,"I can't say I was delighted with this season. I never did like the new Darrin even if he was supposed to have the role in the first place and secondly, the writting was stale. It's like serving a beef wellington every night. It get's old after awhile.
It was very easy to pick up director and producer want's in this show. It came out badly as it did in the last season as well problem is- when the writting is bad anyway don't keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Maybe this show was great for it's time but after the first three seasons watching it is like watching a light house turn around and around and around. Same thing over and over again.
Maybe the show was great for it's time but the Dick Van Dyke show was before this show and it had original story and plot lines.
The saving grace (if any) for this show was Anges Moorehead. She brings sparkle to an other wise dreary script. You could make her say the same thing 100 times over (which they basically do) and she makes it sound like new!",1243209600,2,1018,4.225641025641026

3367643,5,B0014FAIYS,"Season 6 of Bewitched is a great DVD.  Dick Sargent's Darrin seems much more affectionate toward Samantha.  I noticed how almost every episode ended with a long kiss.  It seemed like the Sargent-Montgomery chemistry was greater.  My favorite episode of the season is ""Who's the Wise Witch"" where Samantha's lack of magic creates a vapor lock on the house.  First Endora then Esmeralda then Dr. Bombay get trapped inside the house.  One wonders how many witches are going to get locked in before Bombay's delightful solution.  Tommy Boyce & Bobby Hart's appearance was also a lot of fun in ""Serena Stops the Show.""  Alice Ghostly was a favorite of mine from the Jackie Gleason Show as the fiancee who'd been engaged for over a decade.  Her addition to the cast as Esmeralda was endearing.  Agnes Moorehead continued her delightful Endora.  Carol Wayne's appearance as a bunny was dingy & sweet.  My sense is that the show was reenergized in Season 6.  Enjoy!",1239235200,3,957,4.833333333333333
3367644,5,B0014FAIYS,"""Bewitched"" changed on many fronts in its 6th season, 1969-1970. The most obvious change was the replacement of Dick York by Dick Sargent as Darren. York had a serious back problem that kept him from working, and facing pressure from ABC, both Liz Montgomery and Bill Asher had no choice but to replace him. This was also the year the Ashers made Ashmont Productions. This compnay would go on to produce the remaining years of ""Bewitched"". At the end of the 5th season Elizabeth and William Asher wanted to close production, but ABC, not wanting to lose a hit show, gave them part ownership of the series and huge salary increases.
 Another change was the show's opening. There is new animation featuring Samantha on her broom, along with the new ""Darren"", and we now have an announcer saying, ""Elizabeth Montgomery in...""Bewitched"""".
 30 episodes are included with this boxset and they look clean and crisp as if they were made yesterday. However, the scripts this season started to wane, as they are not as innovative and original as the five previous seasons. Still, if you are an ardent ""Bewitched"" fan, like me, pick up this season to help complete your collection.
 On a final note, since Marion Lorne had died it was important to have a ""dumb"" witch on the show. Alice Ghostley appears this season as Esmeralda, a witch with weak powers who fades whenever she gets nervous. Her performance is both funny and outrageous.
 On a sad note, this was also the year ""Bewitched"" lost a substantial portion of their audience. This was due to the recast of a major player in the series. The show finished at #25, after being at #12 the previous year: a loss of many million viewers. The final Nielsen ratings for the 1969-1970 season was a 20.6.",1238976000,9,1742,4.720394736842105

For me neither of them made much of a difference. The best scenes for me were always centered around Endora, Samantha, and Tabitha. The three actresses were so good and funny together that he almost wasn't even needed. Endora's endless spells on Darren started getting old and boring. Another new charactor was Esmeralda a bumbling witch now that Clara was gone (the actress who played her passed away). This didn't work for me. I adored Clara who was bumbling but lovable at the same time while Esmeralda was just didn't have the same magic as Clara.",1234656000,5,728,4.785714285714286

I hate that it is said that season 7 won't be released until next year 2009 and season 8 the last season won't be released until 2010.  Its just not fair to those of us who are loyal fans.,1212883200,3,305,4.05
3367660,4,B0014FAIYS,"The episodes appear a little soft.  The colors shift from time to time, probably due to the age of the film.  Not a bad set.  Hopefully their will be an extra set when they release all of the seasons with bloopers, outtakes, flubs, etc...  I know they put together a real of these back when they were doing the series, hopefully this real has survived somewhere?  Maybe William Asher or their kids have these reals?",1212019200,3,415,4.48
3367661,5,B0014FAIYS,Good Value -- received on a timely basis -- recommended for all -- good family fun.,1211846400,2,83,4.25
3367662,4,B0014FAIYS,"After a  shaky Season Five, the magic is back on track for a delightful  and enchanting Season Six of ""Bewitched."" Dick York was in terrible physical pain throughout his five year run; and he just couldn't continue on the show anymore. It is sad, but it is a fact, people. I wish ""fans"" would show Dick Sargent more respect. Dick Sargent did a wonderful job as well; and the show DID NOT ""jump the broomstick"" when Sargent took over the role of Darrin.  Does anyone else notice how ATTRACTIVE Dick Sargent is? He and Elizabeth Montgomery developed their own special chemistry and formed a wonderful friendship that lasted until Sargent's death in 1994. Sadly, Elizabeth Montgomery died in 1995.
  I'm not going  to get into the ""Dick York Vs. Dick Sargent"" debate; which  I've always regarded as pointless and stupid. I'll just say that Dick York as Darrin always seemed to me to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown because of Samantha's witchcraft, while Dick Sargent was exasperated by it. The transition between the two actors was handeled so subtly and smoothly as to be almost inperceptible.  The series picks up exactly where it was. Towards the end of Season 5, Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)  tells an absent Darrin over the phone that she is pregnant in ""Samantha's Good News."" At the beginning of the Season Six Opener, ""Samantha & The Beanstalk,"" Samantha is painting a crib, asking Darrin what they should name the new baby. Feeling unwanted, Tabitha (Erin Murphy) switches places with fairy tale's Jack (""Family Affair's Johnny Whittaker) and Samantha climbs up the beanstalk after her.
  Although a few plots are ""recycled"" ideas, that is actually a common practice on any long-running Series, and few shows remain as endearing or enduring as ""Bewitched."" (the 30 episodes of Season Six are Episodes #171-#200 in the Series). The excellent ""Bewitched"" writers deserve kudos and praise for keeping the basic premise so fresh and fun throughout numerous and varied production changes. The  Series quality and creativity remained high throughout Season Seven.  As another reviewer so astutely pointed out, boredom  DID NOT set in until Season Eight, the final season. But there is  no need to jump ahead or despair here.
  Season Six is especially busy and fun. Alice Ghostley (who guest-starred as maid Naomi in ""Maid To Order"" in Season Two) joins the cast as maid Esmeralda, a shy, slightly neurotic witch who keeps fading in and out. Marion Lorne, who portrayed the beloved Aunt Clara, died at the end of Season Four. Producers wanted a new character who would also ""mess up the magic"" as Clara had done-- hence, Esmeralda was created. In ""Samantha's Curious Cravings"", a very pregnant Samantha magically receives any food she thinks about. When Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox) attempts to remedy the situation, Samantha disappears whenever she thinks about food, and ""pops over"" to wherever the food is. In a related episode, the outstanding and hilarious ""Samantha's Lost Weekend,"" Samantha accidentally drinks a glass of ""magic"" milk, and can't stop eating! I always wondered if Elizabeth Montgomery had fun filming this particular episode-- because it certainly is great fun to watch! Baby Adam is born, leading to more feelings of rejection by Tabitha; which is the plot of another memorable episode titled ""Tabitha's Very Own Samantha.""
  Besides Jack & The Beanstalk, other ""house guests"" in Season Six include Julius Ceasar, The Artful Dodger, Mother Goose, and Santa Claus! After two previous visits to the North Pole, Santa (Ronald Long) and all of his Elves are stranded at Samantha and Darrin's house! Henry Gibson makes a memorable guest appearance as a mischievous leprechaun sent by Endora (Agnes Moorehead) to wreck havoc in the episode ""If The Shoe Pinches."" Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde), Daddy Maurice (Maurice Evans) and wild Cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery's other delicious Series role) also add to the fun and merriment of Season Six. After all these decades, from child to adult, ""Bewitched"" ALWAYS brings a smile to my face.",1210204800,6,4061,5.061469265367316
3367663,5,B0014FAIYS,"O.k., o.k., maybe I'm in the minority but I can't be the only person who preferred Dick Sargeant's Darrin to Dick York.  Dick York was too neuroticly played which annoyed me at times to no end.  It was hard for me to sympathize with him when Endora cast her spells on him.  Who could blame her??
  Not so with Sargeant.  Sargeant is not only better looking and sexier than York, but it is a well-known fact that Elizabeth Montgomery herself preferred him to York.  Not to mention they had excellent chemistry.  Sargeant also brings a dry wit to Darrin which York did not do.  Its much easier for me to identify with him.
  Now that that is overwith, let's get to Season Six.  This is a step up from Season Five, which because of York's illness, Darrin was missing in many episodes.  The season has some refreshingly fun episodes such as Serena singing ""I'll Blow You a Kiss in the Wind"" with Boyce and Hart, Darrin acting out cliche's, Samantha going on eating binges and the introduction of ""Yoo-Hoo Esmerelda"" and a very funny episode about the ""Mona Lisa"".
  The series had plenty of life left in it and it is a season which will disappoint no real Bewitched aficionados. Only two seasons to go for this classic series!!",1210204800,15,1223,4.52054794520548
