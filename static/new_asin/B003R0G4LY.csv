8402745,3,B003R0G4LY,"First of all, this dvd was released in 2010 and must be judged in that light. Since that time, many of the cases presented here have had further developments. However, just about all of them involved interesting people and/or memorable events. As for the presentation itself, it is straight ahead without any in-depth interviews or analysis. Each case is merely presented in an almost news-like fashion. If you're expecting updates or new information, you'll most likely be disappointed. While not a bad collection, it doesn't offer anything new.  However, while it may fall a bit short overall, it does offer a wide range of many different types of people and events. That alone is worth at least one viewing.",1521417600,,710,4.966386554621849
8402746,5,B003R0G4LY,Truly happy with this purchase. From shipping to product all excellent.  Very refreshing information I didn't realize or know.,1473465600,,126,5.631578947368421
8402747,1,B003R0G4LY,"An excellent example of the kind of crime reporting which became the (sub) standard with the advent of 24/7 News.  No substance- all got cha' & grab title and a disregard for accuracy or audience intelligence.  The Ripper; Bonnie & Clyde; Mike Tyson and Sophia Loren, the only thing these four have in common are the last two are famous persons and the first two are famous crimes. Ground beef with lots of filler.",1358467200,,414,4.581081081081081

8402750,1,B003R0G4LY,I only made it through the first hour of this before I actually just threw it away.  I watched it the same day I received it. The show was very unorganized and was trying to do too much without any real reporting or consistency in information... not recommended at all...,1309305600,,271,4.42
8402751,3,B003R0G4LY,"First of all I think this DVD set is very interesting, bizarre but interesting. This 13-part series ranges from the extreme and chilling (Jack the Ripper, September 11, Black Dahlia) to the outlandish and outrageous (celebrity DUI and shoplifting scandals). You go from Al Capone to Snoop Dogg (!), from The Zodiac Killer to Martha Stewart. So it's a strange mix of cases but for every weak case (Lil' Kim, Sophia Loren) there's at least two very interesting cases. The segments are not very long, and that's what is so diappointing about this set, the entire documentary is only 5 hours long, it's disappointing when you know that most documentaries made by Mill Creek are between 7 and 9 hours long. This Documentary should have been at least 8 hours long. But this is still a very good buy, for only 10$ you can't go wrong. Buy this very interesting, entertaining ( but bizarre ) Documentary.

Here is the list of cases featured on the set:
Episode 01 - The Attempted Assassination of Ronald Reagan, Bonnie & Clyde, Martha Stewart, The Killing Fields, Terrorist Sea Suicide Bombing, Sophia Loren.
