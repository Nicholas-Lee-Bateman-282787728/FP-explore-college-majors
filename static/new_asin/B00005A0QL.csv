1410209,5,B00005A0QL,"BAIL OUT stars inter-galactic / multi-dimensional mega-god, David Hasselhoff as tennis enthusiast / bounty hunter, Roger ""W.B."" (White Bread) Donaldson. His latest job involves checking out an heiress named Nettie (Linda Blair- THE EXORCIST 1 and 2, HELL NIGHT, DEAD SLEEP). What seems like it should be an easy assignment turns into a dangerous adventure filled w/ violence, murder, and intrigue. W.B. assembles his team of professional operatives (aka: goofballs) after Nettie is kidnapped by machinegun-toting thugs. Donaldson and company must risk their lives, blow stuff up, and mimic the A-team in order to rescue Nettie. They find themselves in the middle of a war between Iranian and Colombian drug-lords! If you crave brainless action, explosions, infinite gunfire, long car chases, and unexpected full frontal nudity, then you have just entered the promised land! Co-stars John Vernon (ANIMAL HOUSE, KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE) as Nettie's father. Do not miss this blessed event!...",1390694400,4,996,5.516339869281046
1410210,1,B00005A0QL,"I like old movies and I thought ""Bailout"" was really lousy UNTIL I watched ""Deadly Drifter"", both were very, very bad and the reviewer must have taken drugs cause I didn't see what he did, I maybe forced to watch em again as some serial killer escaped my detection. These movies actually make you feel bad for the actors? !",1390348800,,323,4.4

1410212,1,B00005A0QL,"This movie is described as "" funny, and often outright silly"" but it is completely insipid. Don't waste your time or money on this one.  It's disappointing because I love David Hasselhoff.  This movie is 'WAY beneath his talent!!",1352246400,,229,4.846153846153846

A FEW FUNNY MOMENTS AND SOME OK ACTION SCENES SAVE THIS FROM BEING A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. I ONLY PAID $1 FOR THIS MOVIE AT A DOLLAR STORE AND JUDGING FROM WHAT I SAW, I PRETTY MUCH GOT WHAT I PAID FOR. CHECK IT OUT IF YOU WANT, BUT DON'T EXPECT MUCH.",1098835200,,376,4.236111111111111
