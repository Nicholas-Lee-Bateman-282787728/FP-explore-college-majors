8422005,5,B004BKGUZ4,"This drama is not a playful rom-com that's for sure!! Instead, it reminds me of the old-school drama's that put Korean entertainment on the map. Full of intrigue; the back-stabbing, constantly plotting merciless greedy two-faced characters that try to take it all from their kind-hearted associates motivates me to give this drama 5 stars!! I LOVE So Ji Sub!!!",1489104000,,360,5.11864406779661
