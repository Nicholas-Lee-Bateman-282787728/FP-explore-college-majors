8146119,4,B000ILZ6FK,"Modonna Grimes in an excellent teacher here.... you feel like you're on a 1 on 1 class. There's no slick editing, it's real & honest down to her ""WOOOPS! & ponytail fixing which I love.
The music could have been A LOT louder... that's is my only complaint. The music played was great though, some top 40 music. I love her enthusiasm, the woop! were fun, but since she does that, I couldn't turn up the volume more to hear the music.
She teaches several times in 1/2 time, then normal speed several times before moving on. Not too much slowing down so that you get bored, but not so fast you get lost. You repeat all the step learned into a routine each time you learn a new one.
The moves she chose I enjoyed. I wish all dance workouts were this pace, friendly, energetic. Sambas, african moves, cha-chas, mambos, double steps, etc. a final double turn (she even turns her back to you so you cam mirror her.) Nothing too complex, yet not lame either. I felt comfortable with as she went along & never felt frustrated.
She start with a 1 min intro asking you to do your own stretching for 5 min, the goes right into a fast mambo that she doesn't teach which scared me, but that's the only thing she doesn't teach & it's an easy move. The warm up has some simple dance moves that really stretch the arms, torso, chest, some plies, lunges, hamstring stretching, etc.
The whole routine is 35 min with the last 4 min doing the whole routine several times to really speed up the heart rate.
There's a bonus of 12 min of abs, all lying down, 95% all different style of crunches, some oblique work crunches, lower leg lifts, a 1/4 bridge w/crunch & some added push ups.
Ends with 8 min of stretching, mostly yoga style like butterfly, reclined spinal twists, etc.

You can see 2 clips of previews on youtube looking up ""maddona grimes"" & ""afro latino""",1194307200,5,1843,4.388888888888889
8146120,3,B000ILZ6FK,"Somewhat dissapointing because I like her earthy moves but routine is short.  She is easy to follow so you feel better that you are getting into. Then, just when you are getting the endorphins, it is over. There is a 10 minute abs work out at the end of the dance routine.
