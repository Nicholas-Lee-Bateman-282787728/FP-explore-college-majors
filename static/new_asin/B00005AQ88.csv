7935547,5,B00005AQ88,"To those critics who've attacked Jack London as being out of touch with ""identity politics"", this film would surely be an embarrassment.

This movie, and the Jack London story upon which it's based -- ""The Mexican"" -- go to show that London was eminently egalitarian in his social views and far ahead of his time with respect to human rights, as author Cecelia Tichi shows us in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-London-A-Writer-s-Fight-for-a-Better-America/dp/1469622661/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack London: A Writer's Fight for a Better America</a>.  Contrary to what critics such as Jeanne Campbell Reesman assert&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-London-s-Racial-Lives-A-Critical-Biography/dp/0820337811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack London's Racial Lives: A Critical Biography</a>, author and social activist Jack London had a deeply humanistic view of the world, first voiced in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-People-of-the-Abyss/dp/B0082S2B40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The People of the Abyss</a>&nbsp;and later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iron-Heel/dp/B00847CZZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iron Heel</a>&nbsp;as well as many of his short stories.

It's not especially compelling as a movie if one does not understand the context, as well as the drastic, draconian political shift that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s.  It's very important, though, because it illustrates London's desire and understanding that peoples and nations ought to have the opportunity to be free, and operate in a democratic society, something popular historian Kevin Starr seems to have missed.

London's story concerns a young Mexican who lost his family and village to Federale forces during the revolution of 1910-20.  Felipe Rivera crosses the border and finds work in a small office in El Paso, publishing political materials in support of Francisco Madero, who opposed dictator Porfirio Diaz in the 1910 elections.  An amateur boxer, Rivera earns money helping established American boxers train, donating it all to the cause.  He allies himself with ""Durango"", one of Madero's rebel leaders, and determines to earn $5000 needed to buy guns for the rebels.  To do this, he manages to get a fight, winner take all, with a local hero after showing talent as a sparring partner.  No one thinks he's much of a contender, and the fate of the revolution hangs in the balance.

Jack London's stories were frequently used a basis for screenplays and continue to be to this day (think of Indiana Jones, first conceived in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hearts-of-Three-by-Jack-London/dp/B0075LVZYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hearts of Three by Jack London</a>, 2001: A Space Odyssey, clearly outlined in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-One/dp/B0082ZFNOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red One</a>, and ""The Hunger Games"" very obviously based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iron-Heel/dp/B00847CZZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iron Heel</a>, and countless others), and prior to his copyrights expiring in 1986, he was often given credit, though not always.  ""The Fighter"" is one example of a film based on a Jack London story which was not afraid praise London for the lover of freedom he was.",1473552000,,3524,7.038901601830664

7935553,3,B00005AQ88,"Three films are in one DVD. ""The Joe Louis Story"" (1953), ""The Fighter"" (1952) and ""Fight for the Title"" (1957).

""The Joe Louis Story"" follows the life and career of Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis. Coley Wallace himself a professional boxer plays him and the actual fight footages of Louis are used for the bout scenes. The film opens with his final fight on the ring with future champion Rocky Marciano and then a fictional sportswriter played by Paul Stewart starts to recount the real story of Joe Louis with voiceovers.

I don't know to what extent the film's story could be called real. The slick narrative tells most of the major events in his amazing career, but not much about himself or his personality. This is not to say the film lacks dramatic moments - James Edwards gives authentic and touching portrayal of Joe's trainer and mentor Jack 'Chappie' Blackburn, but the film is a bit disappointing if you're looking for the reasons for the great impact that Joe Louis gave American sports and culture.

(DVD jacket has the name of Ossie Davis on its cover, but his role is small and uncredited.)

""The Fighter"" is based on Jack London's short story ""The Mexican."" A boxer named Felipe Rivera (Richard Conte) fights in the ring to win the money and buy the guns for revolution in Mexico. The story itself is basically the same as London's short, but the original's lonely hero, who is liked and understood by no one else, is significantly changed; he talks and, it seems, one lady is romantically attracted to him. The film is just an average drama with good boxing sequences at the end.

""Fight for the Title"" (that runs about 27 minutes) is actually an episode from TV series ""Star for Today."" It stars George Brenlin as disillusioned Lightweight Champion Benny Leonard who really wants to enlist in the army. A young boxer Kid Lombard is desperate to defeat the champion, but obviously Kid has no chance and Benny knows it. The story takes a surprising turn when Benny meets Kid again in the gym. It is a good story (and most probably fictional one despite the name of Benny Leonard), but too sentimental you might say. Don't miss young Michael Landon (""Little House on the Prairie"" as Kid.

This is a nice collection, but don't expect the crisp images and sound.",1200268800,3,2277,4.694235588972431
7935554,1,B00005AQ88,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie again after so many years, however, the DVD that I received was missing about the first 20 minutes, including credits.

With the missing parts, the DVD is really pretty worthless.",1192233600,6,229,4.871794871794871
7935555,3,B00005AQ88,"Ok, I was looking for the much sought after documentary to see Joe Louis in the flesh, hear him speak, watch live footage of the fights. THIS AINT IT! You are better off going to pbs.org and getting American Experience: THE FIGHT DVD PBS Joe Louis.

The actor certainly looks like a cross between Muhammed Ali and Joe Louis, the fight signs are just drama. To get a piece of history, this is not where to start your collection. But if you want to watch a 1950's movie which for me is way above my time, get it. Hope this helps",1100908800,6,526,4.207920792079208
