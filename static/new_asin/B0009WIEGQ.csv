8068442,3,B0009WIEGQ,"Feng Shui, the art of placing things to bring auspiciousness into one's life, is at the heart of ""My Lucky Star"", a comedy starring Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Miriam Yeung.

Miriam Yeung plays Yip Koo Hung, a young woman who won't start the day without first consulting horoscopes, tarot cards, and her luopan or compass.  You see, she considers herself to be the queen of misfortune.  Bad luck follows her as if it were her shadow.  Yet she remains cheerful and determined to change her lot in life.  After 3 years, she finally manages to get an appointment to see Lai Liu Po (Tony Leung), one of the top feng shui masters in Hong Kong.  However, she has to change her name and trick her way into his office because he refuses to see anybody whose surname is Yip.  Unbeknown to her, it was one of his ancestors who unintentionally lent a hand in breaking her family luck.

The movie is at its best in the first half when it focuses on the budding relationship between Yip and Lai.  Tony Leung makes a handsome and dapper Lai while Miriam Yeung's Yip is a combination of impulsiveness, kindness and naivet&eacute;.  The second half of the movie revolves around Lai's solving his family motto (and riddle): ""Know a Yip, make a loss"" and in fighting the bad guys who are intent in cursing Yip although it is not very clear why they want to get rid of her in the first place since at the beginning of the movie she did not seem to be in anybody's way.

""My Lucky Star"" is lite fare, simple and feel-good.  It is the kind of movie you may want to watch when you wish to call it a day with a smile.",1124582400,4,1590,4.316498316498317
