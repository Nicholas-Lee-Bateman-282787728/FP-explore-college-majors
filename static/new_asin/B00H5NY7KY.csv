6133586,2,B00H5NY7KY,"Of course, the first movie is great but the sequel is horrible.  The characters have the same names but are different actors and the story line is boring.  It doesn't come close to comparing to the original.  It was a waste of my money.  Just buy the original if you don't have it.",1425168000,2,281,4.245283018867925

6133709,5,B00H5NY7KY,"Imagine my surprise and delight when I found out one of the best movies ever was remade and they come packaged together for less than buying either of them separately!  In all seriousness though, the 1998 version is fun and entertaining (who doesn't love a young Tom Felton as Peagreen), even if it's not the most well made movie of all time, I still really love it after buying this ""fun pack"" and watching it again.  The updated version stays true to the spirit of the original and is definitely worth a watch, especially as at the time I'm writing this, buying the original on its own is more expensive and the remake individually is the same price.  The only thing about this combo pack, that didn't bother me, but might bother some people, is that both movies come on 1 disc; there are not individual discs for each film.",1470268800,9,826,4.493333333333333
