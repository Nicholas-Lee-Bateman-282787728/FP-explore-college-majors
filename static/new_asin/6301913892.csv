7816577,5,6301913892,"This is a wonderful comedy about a rich playboy played by Lowell Sherman who falls in love with a working girl named Helen Andrews (Irene Dunne.) With much reluctance she accepts the job of a secretary to work for him and then finds herself protecting him from a jealous husband who comes storming into his apartment with a gun.  Lowell Sherman plays wonderfully as a smooth seducer with charm and magnetism who befriends several women. Two notables are the sister of Helene Andrews played by Claudia Dell, and a married woman, Agatha Caraway played by the beautiful Mae Murray, the ""girl with bee-stung lips."" The content of the movie is quite mature and the Hollywood went ahead in producing these controversial films in the pre-code era. The story is very funny but it also deals with sexuality, teasing, infidelity, rich playboys, the influence of wealth in seducing women, etc. I very much liked the scenes in which Mae Murray appears as she steals the show with witty remarks and making unwelcome advances towards Sherman. The movie is also directed by Lowell Sherman, and written by Walter Ruben and John Lawson.  One of the witty dialogues is as follows:

Rollins, Wayne's Butler: [holding up a diamond bracelet] Er, I found this, sir.
Wayne Carter: You find the strangest things in a bachelor's apartment.
Rollins, Wayne's Butler: Do you suppose the lady lost anything else, sir?
Wayne Carter: Well, if she did, she didn't lose it here.",1406764800,2,1445,4.889795918367347

The film could use a restoration but it was very enjoyable anyway.  However, they could have cut a couple of minutes here and there and taken out a few details to put the main plot more into the spotlight; there's quite a bit going on in this picture.

When the action starts, we get a few chuckles from a scene in which a butler named Rollins (Charles Coleman) is trying to get some morning juice for his employer Wayne Carter (Lowell Sherman)--but Rollins keeps getting interrupted by endless phone calls and people ringing the doorbell. Indeed, this is the home of a very busy man--not just busy in the way of professional investing but also quite busy in terms of running around with women. In fact, Wayne has so many women conquests under his belt that he has a ""lost and found"" drawer full of diamond necklaces in his apartment and women show up out of nowhere to claim them! There's even more proof that Wayne is quite the promiscuous man: we see him pick up a woman for a romantic encounter after her taxi hits a truck and they have themselves some fun after Wayne tells his butler to take the rest of the day off!

At the same time, we also meet Helene Andrews (Irene Dunne) and her sister Lita (Claudia Dell). Helene is looking for work as a stenographer and Lita wants to be in a Broadway show. Lita also has her sights set on very wealthy men who can give her endless presents, money and gifts so she'll never have to work again, much to the chagrin of Helene who is much more sedate, conventional and reserved. It isn't long before Lita gets involved with Wayne; and Helene goes to Wayne's apartment to fetch her wayward sister. Wayne takes an immediate liking to Helene; but Helene dislikes Wayne intensely since he's a promiscuous playboy.

Of course, things get more complicated from here. Helene needs work badly; but when she discovers Wayne hired her through an employment agency to be his stenographer Helene and Wayne are off to a bad start. Wayne dares Helene to be his personal assistant after giving her a big increase in salary and Helene finally takes the job in the hopes that Wayne will actually keep his hands to himself.

I'll stop here to avoid giving away spoilers and there's more to the plot than what I've written here; suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out. Look for Mae Murray to play Mrs. Agatha Carraway, a woman who just won't take ""no"" for an answer from Wayne. Purnell Pratt plays Agatha's husband Herb very well and Noel Francis plays Janet. Ivan Lebedeff plays ""Pete,"" a dancer in a Broadway show put on by Lee Graham (Norman Kerry). Look closely and you'll also see Kitty Kelly of Ziegfeld Follies fame as Miss Clark, the first woman in the ladies' room scene.

Bachelor Apartment is wonderful for fans of the actors in it and people who like racy pre-Codes with a few surprises along the way will not be disappointed. I just wish the plot was a bit tighter with one or two less complications!",1365811200,3,3132,4.534513274336283
7816579,4,6301913892,"John Howard Lawson, later one of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, composed this screenplay which is ostensibly quite the reverse from his normal proletarian bent, but is actually deeply altered by wordsmith J. Walter Ruben to a suave and somewhat risqu (pre-Code) comedy. Fortunately, some sense of Lawson's customary concerns remains, and is dealt with nicely by Irene Dunne, co-starring with the elegant Lowell Sherman, who also directs with his usual flare in this tale of a Park Avenue man about town struggling with a raft of nubile and aggressive young creatures. An early sound film, it forms the first arrangement of what has become a basic cinema plot device, as we know it, that of the carefree unmarried man being chastened from his rollicking ways by exposure to feelings of romantic love. Cinematography by the brilliant Lee Tover is of particular value here and one should advert to the art direction of Max Ree, who garnered an Academy Award for his characteristic talent during this same year (1931) as a result of his work with CIMARRON. Although Mae Murray's flamboyance is transcendental, the acting is generally quite good, with a particularly strong and stage-accented performance from the lovely Dunne as an older sister attempting to shepherd a wayward sibling while standing her own ground against a playboy's blandishments. One of the final pieces of Sherman's tragically shortened directorial career, the film offers many admirable passages, none less so than the opening scene, with that eternal butler Charles Coleman patiently dealing with an importunate telephone and doorbell, setting the pace in a picture that never pushes too hard or tries too strenuously for its effects.",1154044800,2,1704,5.2226277372262775
7816580,4,6301913892,"I must say that I didn't expect to enjoy this movie in another sense than being an early 1930's Pre-Code talkie, an interesting rarity, featuring an early performance by later superstar Irene Dunne.
But I was surprised, because the film is rather funny, thanks to some expert performances, especially by its leading man Lowell Sherman (an actor who also directed some films); maybe he looks somewhat old for playing the ""bachelor"" to be redeemed of the title (he was 46 when he made the film), but his skill and flair for comedy is undeniable.
Also in the cast, as the girl he falls for, is Irene Dunne, in an early performance as a stenographer. We too, have the rare chance of watching silent diva Mae Murray, who only appeared in three talking pictures (this being one of them) in the early 30s. Yes, at last, I finally had the opportunity of watching the famous diva with the bee-stung lips (I'd never seen any of her more famous silent films). Here she plays an outrageously amoral flirtatious married woman, Mrs. Agatha Carraway, who's after Sherman, in spite of his constant rejections towards her affections. Her performance is affected and flamboyant, but nevertheless funny and winning.
Also in the cast beautiful Claudia Dell, as Dunne's sister, a lesser known early '30s actor, continental and debonair Ivan Lebedeff, and silent star Norman Kerry.
The out of print 1990 Turner Home Entertainment VHS edition features a rather awful copy; people from Turner Classic Movies: This early talkie needs urgent restoring!!.",1055030400,8,1528,4.97265625
7816581,3,6301913892,"An oddball film, it will only be of interest to die-hard film buffs. While entertaining one of his many lady friends, Wayne Carter (Lowell Sherman), a well-to-do Park Avenue bachelor, is interrupted by the arrival of attractive Helene Andrews (Irene Dunne, in a bizarre role).  She has come to the apartment to fetch her younger sister - who is having a tete-a-tete with the butler, not Wayne...Full of actors from the antique era of talkies, including Norman Kerry, Noel Francis, Arline Judge and Bess Flowers, this little curio will be of interest to those who are interested in seeing Mae Murray in a speaking role.  Eccentric, affected and thoroughly full of herself, Murray was 42 here (as Agatha Carraway): her once fairly successful career (in silents) would soon be over. Murray was famous for her off-screen eccentricities and haughty behaviour.  Her other feature from 1931 was a turkey entitled PEACOCK ALLEY.  In 1959, Mae wrote her autobiography: THE SELF ENCHANTED: it was not a best seller, to put it mildly.  Murray died in relative obscuriy in 1965, aged 76.",1041984000,3,1075,4.983240223463687
