8015368,5,B0001NJ9NK,"This was my favorite of the ladies styling videos.  Not only is it entertaining, there are some great moves to learn and easy to follow because she does everything facing her partner instead of facing you.
She shows three styles, the glamour girl who has more conservative, dainty moves; the city girl who wants to get exercise and have fun; and the rebel girl who's moves are more funky and surprising.
She also does play acting with her husband to show how to say no to someone, how to ask someone to dance, etc.  If her husband's expressions throughout the video don't make you laugh, you don't know how to be silly.  My 8 yr. old son wanted me to replay it for him.  If these parts are not for you simply fast forward.  The video is long and there are plenty of creative and beautiful dance moves to learn.",1373155200,,810,4.373333333333333
8015369,1,B0001NJ9NK,"This is the worst DVD that Edie has made.  this one is more about fashion and dancing to a fashion.

Millenium style yeah no problem, but not this DVD.  I would NOT recommmend buying it.

There are some other good ones. Check around",1138579200,3,232,4.325581395348837
8015370,2,B0001NJ9NK,"I was very glad to see a DVD called Ladies Styling on the market.  But I must say that I am very disappointed with the material.  Half the DVD discusses wearing hats, scarves and accessories to add something to your dancing.  And then a ten minutes about how to use a device to make you stand up straighter. Just show me the moves and how to make the moves look better!  Don't waste my time with silly names and a fashion show!",1121126400,4,427,4.170731707317073
8015371,5,B0001NJ9NK,"This video is great!  I'm an intermediate salsa dancer, but my dancing is very uninspired. Edie presents hand and footwork styling  moves for Glamor Girl (read slower/more basic), City Gurl (more advanced, faster), and Rebel Girl (advanced, very athletic, very sexy). This is stuff that I can do and won't feel unnatural. Includes tips on accessories, clothes, asking guys to dance, what to do with the agressive dancer, etc. Lots of great info, very useful!",1108080000,3,458,5.093333333333334
8015372,5,B0001NJ9NK,"At over 2 hours of material this is the longest Salsa instructional video ever produced.
This is the follow on from the World famous Ladies Styling video No. 1.
This video is amazing.
This is a must have for any female Salsa dancers no matter what you level.
We also found the video to be of interest for males who want their females to look great.
It follows a similar pattern to the first ladies styling video with sections on styling techniques that will work no matter what type of partner you have, Edie also answers a lot of questions about etiquette, style, when and when not to do certain moves, how to ask a guy to dance without looking like an idiot, how to politely say ""no"", how to deal with drunks, how and when to wear a posture brace, T-stance moves, hijacking moves.
Edie demonstrates the types of styling moves you can do, not only with different outfits, but when you're in different moods. The moves are demonstrated both on the ""One"" and the ""Two"", the moves range from Beginner through Highly Advanced.
This video is highly recommended.",1081900800,5,1057,4.568421052631579
