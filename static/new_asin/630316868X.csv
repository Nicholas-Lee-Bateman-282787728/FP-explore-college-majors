7839805,5,630316868X,"This is the best movie von Trotta ever made.  Her later ones were too overtly political, without the characters that make you care about their politics.  Not so in Die Bleierne Zeit (The Heavy Time), here called Marianne & Juliane.  Her characters are strong and believable.  The times and the mood of the times are authentically portrayed.  If you know about the Baader Meinhof terrorists and what they did, it's hard to imagine a good side to them.  They were brutal murderers.  Yet this film manages to present at least an understandable side to some of them.  When von Trotta made this movie, she was at the peak of her powers, both as writer and director.  She's written and directed some real turkeys; polemics rather than movies.  But this one is poignant and powerful, with very well-drawn characters (especially the two sisters).  Worth watching as a great film.  And also as a view from ""the other side"" of a killing time in German history.",1357862400,,950,4.725609756097561
7839806,5,630316868X,"In the early 1980's I lived for art-house films. ""Marianne & Juliane"" nearly cured me of that: My knees were knocking trying to leave the showing. No other film (for me) better portrays the love/hate bond between siblings or the experience of well-minded individuals slamming up against established political structures. What I only learned recently from trolling the internet, is that the film is based on real-life sisters and the events that transpired in their lives. The story is a series of horrors that von Troota underplays at each step. No other director could have, or would have made this film. Pair it with Fassbinder's ""The Third Generation,"" and you have a haunghting view of radical politics in Germany.

This film won several awards but never reached a wide audience. Sadly, this has been true of much of von Trotta's work until the recent ""Rossenstrasse."" For me, ""Rossenstrasse"" is powerful but von Trotta-lite. For the political seek out ""Rosa Luxemburg,"" ""Das Versprechen"" (1995) [The Promise] and two films made with her then-husband Volker Schlondorf: The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum (1975) [codirector] and ""Die Flschung"" (1981) [Circle of Deceit -coauthor] both bear her stamp. For the personal as political, ""Schwestern oder Die Balance des Glcks"" (1979) [Sisters, or the Balance of Happiness] is a don't miss.",1175990400,,1336,5.185185185185185
7839807,5,630316868X,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and I don't say that lightly.  Images from this film haunt my sleep even now, and it is a week since I've seen it.  That is the kind of impact that director Margarethe  von Trotta must have been going for -- she wanted her audience to feel this  film viscerally, which was exactly what her protagonists, the  Baader-Meinhof group, were also going for -- one should generally feel a  firebombing quite viscerally.  Von Trotta succeeds. This is the story of  two West German sisters during the politcally turbulant late 60's and early  70's.  One works within the system to reform it; the other has abandoned  all societal values and lives on the fringes as a terrorist (the film is  based on real characters).  The viewer is dropped into the story as it is  already unfolding.  Things have already gone downhill, and they're about to  get worse.  Von Trotta frames her story brilliantly and the inner portion,  a series of ongoing tableaus and flashbacks, show how each sister has  arrived to her present moral condition. This is not an easy film to watch.  It is bleak and it is harrowing.  It is simply a tragedy.  The German  title, ""The Time of Lead"", is infinitely more fitting than the  vapid English title.  There are various scenes that must remain with one.  It is as tragic as anything Goethe or Shakespeare could have imagined. But  -- stick around until the end.  Von Trotta had something  larger in mind.  It is also one of the most life-affirming movies -- not syrupy, mind you  (this film did NOT come out of Hollywood -- one must THINK about this one),  that is available.  ""Think"" is the key. The only violence one  sees in this film is after the fact, at all generational levels.  Baader-Meinhof were not the only ones inflicting violence, and bankers were  not the only ones who suffered.  Watch, and see who really suffers, and you  may rethink your entire moral outlook -- as I did, after seeing this  remarkable film.",959990400,18,1986,4.597701149425287
7839808,5,630316868X,"I first saw this video at a writing conference at Skidmore; having been a student in Germany at the time of the events described, I have to say that the film brought back with ferocious emotional impact the ambivalent  feelings of an American onlooker to the upheaval then going on in German  academic and political circles.  The film is one of the most gripping and  involving I have ever seen. It deserves a wider public.  I use it to show  my German language students what the issues at stake were during the  student revolt in Germany.",943833600,10,539,4.552083333333333
7839809,5,630316868X,"Die Bleierne Zeit (Marianne & Juliane) is a captivating film about two sisters, very different on the surface but forever linked by a common personal and political history. Von Trotta brings German history to life  with this film set in the period of the Baader-Mainhof terrorist group's  reign in Germany. A suspenseful film with a bit of conspiracy and unsolved  mystery thrown in.",933206400,7,383,5.0476190476190474
