2597357,4,B000G19OP0,"While I'd have liked a bit more direct linkage to traditional Tai Chi forms (Yang style, for instance), Rami's demonstrations and educational material are top-notch. A very valuable addition to the serious student's knowledge library.",1209600000,9,234,5.714285714285714
2597358,5,B000G19OP0,"I looked forward to the release of this video, having been very satisfied with the previous effort by Ramel Rones in Sunrise Tai Chi.  I remember being somewhat skeptical when I first reviewed Sunrise Tai Chi.  I thought it would be something akin to the light versions of Taijiquan that seem to be the latest flavor of the day.  It turned out to be a very well produced and thought out study of Taijiquan, with some excellent demonstrations of issuing power using the techniques and applications of Taijiquan.

The latest effort by Ramel Rones, with the addition of David Silver's always present high production standards as well as his input in the writing of this DVD, has resulted in an excellent training guide for beginners and advanced students.  Truly, the best offering of knowledge, through teaching or other methods, should be adaptable by both beginners and advanced students.

If you are just beginning to learn Taijiquan.  If you have been studying and practicing Taijiquan for many years.  Then this DVD will provide very relevant and usable knowledge.  The most advanced knowledge is always to be found close at hand, in the basics of the art.

The DVD comes with two disks.

Now when I look at this list of moves to practice, it looks like a lot of work.  In reality, there is even more material than expected, as the DVD covers sitting and standing versions of the techniques, as well as various applications using postures from the form to demonstrate the use of  these techniques.  Every one one of these exercises come from Taijiquan movements.  The four main energies, Ward Off, Rollback, Press and Push, are four of the original thirteen postures.  These four postures also represent the cardinal directions.  The other four directions, the diagonals, are represented by the moves Pull Down, Split, Elbow Stroke and Shoulder Stroke.  Add the directions forward, backward, left, right and center and you have the original thirteen postures of Taijiquan.

From what I've read and understood, as well as noticed during practice of the styles, is that Yang style focuses on the four cardinal moves, Ward Off, Rollback, Press and Push, and Chen style focuses on the diagonals, Pull Down, Split, Elbow Stroke and Shoulder Stroke.  Both styles use all of the thirteen, but their focus is on a different set of moves than the other.

The next Section is a Partner Demonstration, showing numerous techniques and methods for practicing the four energies of Yang Taijiquan.  The use of large and small balls also comes into play, reminiscent of some of the teaching in Taiji Ball Qigong, a DVD by Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming.  Ramel Rones, being one of Dr. Yang's senior students, has obviously grasped well the use of the Taiji Ball.

As this section uses two people, applications are more easily and freely demonstrated.  The use of the four energies is demonstrated using the partners as they attempt techniques on various parts of the body.  The energies or four postures are then demonstrated being used in combination with each other.

The two person drills are excellent and help to make the learning of Taijiquan more interactive and enjoyable.

The totality of DISK 1 was shot outdoors with great scenery and natural sounds.  At one point I thought I had a criticism of this DVD.  During the demonstration of the movements in the grassy fields, it seemed like beginning students would have a difficult time to determine if Ramel was stepping to his heel, or toe, or flat footed.  The long grass in the field made it difficult at times to see clearly the foot positions of Ramel as he demonstrated the movements.  As the placing of one's feet and the root of the practitioner is such a vital part of correct Taijiquan, I was thinking this could be a problem.  However, on DISK 2, when the moves are very clearly taught and broken down into their components, the setting is indoors and the feet positions and placement can be clearly discerned.

Now we are still on DISK 1 of this two disk set.  DISK 1 then offers a choice of three different workouts to follow along with:

STANDING WORKOUT  33 MINUTES

SITTING WORKOUT  29 MINUTES

PARTNER WORKOUT  39 MINUTES

Do not dismiss the sitting workout, it is an excellent tool for learning how to move the upper body separate than the lower body.  Many students have trouble separating the movement of the waist from the hips.  Sitting down while doing these routines greatly speeds up the learning process for differentiating hip and waist movement.  Sometimes they do move together, but to achieve the whip effect in Taijiquan, a supple and separate waist movement is essential.

DISK 2

This disk contains the classroom instruction for the techniques and exercises taught in the previous disk.  The moves are well taught and teach learning to take pressure while practicing the move, using the wall as a training tool and using partner drills to hone in on the timing and working with another one's energy.  The classroom section is well taught, as Ramel has a wonderful energy which comes through in his teaching of the skills presented on this DVD.

After working on all of the drills presented on the first disk, Ramel then presents the entire series as one continuous workout.  The moves are first done slowly, and then the speed is increased until the issuing of power becomes manifest.  Ramel gives precise breathing and energy location direction while doing these movements.  The use of walls during the movements is clearly presented in a convincing manner.

Ramel discusses how standing next to a wall while doing these techniques forces one to use the bows of the body to avoid having part of their anatomy being hindered in its movement by the pesky wall.  When one uses bows in the arms, legs front of the trunk and rear of the trunk, movement becomes circular and spiral, allowing more movement in less space.

The final section on DISK 2 is a demonstration of martial applications for the moves.  The wonderful part is that after demonstrating the techniques slowly, and then at fighting speed, the final demo at fighting speed usually involves Ramel taking the move a little further in intensity and adding some extra technique.  For example, when using one technique that employed a head lock while standing, in the final fighting speed demo of the move Ramel followed the student as he fell and applied a tight head lock type of maneuver as they both fell to the ground.

I firmly believe that if a student is just beginning their study of Taijiquan, then study this DVD before learning the form.  If you have been studying Taijiquan for years, then study this DVD for one heck of a refresher course.  In reality, an experienced practitioner will learn much from this DVD.

Kudos to Mr. Rones and Mr. Silver, as well as their teacher, Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming.",1154908800,114,7507,4.89268680445151
2597359,5,B000G19OP0,"This new program from Master Rones is even better than his first, Sunrise Tai Chi. Unlike other videos, which just shows a Tai Chi form for you to follow along with, in this program you receive detailed private instruction from the teacher in a way I have never experienced. Its really like having a one-on-one class with him, and the Tai Chi postures are broken down into much more detail than I've ever seen.

Disc one is an outdoor demonstration of dozens of stretches, warm ups, meditations, visualizations, qigong exercises, and stationary postures for strengthening the body and developing the energetic circulation. Then he moves into teaching individual Tai Chi postures broken into many routines which are practiced sitting or standing. Eventually, the postures are sequenced together into a beautifully flowing form that can be done slowly for health, or more quickly with power for martial arts.

The program emphasizes that anyone at any level of fitness or Tai Chi experience can practice along, and recommends practicing the exercises sitting in a chair. I can see how someone who is injured or infirm could gain great benefits from these routines, and maybe regain the strength to stand and continue practing.

One great aspect is how computer animation is used to show how and where the Qi energy circulates in the body.

Then, later on Disc one there is a complete Partner section, for two-person training. This really helps you to understand what the original purpose of each of the Tai Chi postures are, but again they can be practiced slowly for health, or more quickly for martial arts use.

Disc two is a classroom segment, in which he teaches each of the exercises in more detail, and shows variations for training.

I believe that this program can truly give someone a deep understanding of the art of Tai Chi Chuan, no matter what family style you practice, and that it offers powerful exercises for rejuvenation and exceptional wellness.

I'm R. H. and live in Switzerland!
I'll thank you very much for these wonderfull DVD's and book!
I've bought all of them! Why?
In Germany I had a problem with my health ( skin ) 33 years ago! No striking physician could help me!
I've study Kung Fu with the book from Michael Minick (The Kung Fu Exercise Book: Health Secrets of Ancient China) in 1976!
The results at this time were not what I hoped, but in 1998 I changed my nutrition! At this time I liked to help other people to eat
what I'm eating too but the results were not the same as for me! I've lost 20 kg in 2 month and 10 days exactly!
I'll took my book and read it after 33 years one more time ! I believe to fond the solution in the book: the transport of nutrition avec
the respiration will go to the cellules in our body and it is 100%! NORMALLY 80%!
In your book the respiration is the same and this is the reason why I've choosen your book!
In my opignon the secret of all is we have more oxygen as the others and with your book my organs are always happy! :)

In Germany I was a professional soccer ( MSV Duisburg 1979/1980 ) !
Specialists asked me often why my heart beat so slowly after a strong effort !
I coulden't answer at this time but tody I am sure it was the chineese technic of respiration!
And with your Tai Chi I can feel my lungs! I'm very very happy!

Greetings
