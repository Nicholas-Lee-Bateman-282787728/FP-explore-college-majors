7920352,5,B00004CRLD,"There are some things you like, only if you like them. There are other things that unless you totally dislike something, you have to love it. The 1995 Edinburgh Military Tattoo is the latter. Spectacle, ceremony, tradition, proficiency, setting , presentation, you have to go five stars all the way. OK I suppose the lighting could have been a little better. The film quality could be a little better with more light. But maybe that would mar the presentation. So I am sticking with five stars.

Includes the first appearance since 1957 of the nine time world champion Lothian & Borders Police, as well as performers from France (La Musique Du 42nd Regiment De Transmissions), Cairo (Egyptian Military Musical Group) and South Africa (Pipes and Drums of the Witwatersrand Rifles). The Egyptian band is a nod towards history by way of Scottish stewards who claimed to be descended from Pharaohs. France is introduced in most wry manner as ""ally of Scotland for 700 years"".

Music, marching, costumes, everything is there. And comes in sturdy protective plastic box!",1396137600,,1064,5.005649717514125
