3515712,5,B001CQS7KG,One of the best shows on the History Channel. Very Few people could be ice road truckers.,1240617600,,89,4.294117647058823
3515713,2,B001CQS7KG,"Season one was much better,too many scenes repeated,sub-titles flashed on and off faster than you could read them and too much emphasis on ""Rick the Wreck"" and his constant whining. These drivers all seem to hate each other and the show seems to focus on that. Alex seems to be the only one with a sense of humor and a good attitude. Too bad he is ill and hope he has a full recovery. I will pass if there is a season three!!",1232841600,,425,4.132530120481928
3515714,5,B001CQS7KG,"He was very specific when he requested this for Christmas and, by his own testimony, he LOVES it. Keep on truckin' I guess.",1231804800,,123,4.391304347826087
3515715,5,B001CQS7KG,AWESOME! Winter road just gets in your blood. It's like a soap opera for rednecks! I love this series and it's edge of your seat excitement even though you know they will mostly make it!,1231632000,6,186,4.3428571428571425
3515716,4,B001CQS7KG,This one is not as good as the first one. Two men that have to grow up in it.,1231632000,,77,3.1052631578947367

An eclectic group of ice road drivers, the bleeped out language, interaction between drivers and the sheer ""man vs the elements"" made for quite an enjoyable series.

Season Two was a bit of a disappointment.  The weeks depicting the gas drill rig being moved and reassembled was good but watching week after week of Hugh ""The Polar Bear"" driving a waste truck, Rick transporting dirty snow and Drew delivering candy & soda just killed the novelty of the whole series.  I'll be taking a pass on Season Two!

Notice that because this year has been in the US, all drivers are wearing seat belts; even our lovable Canadian drivers.  Perhaps next season will be in the Asian Arctic.  That would be ""cool""!",1226707200,5,1285,6.473684210526316
3515718,4,B001CQS7KG,"I got this for my husband for a Christmas gift.  It is pretty entertaining.  It is mostly just ""fluff"" T.V., but watching some of these guys whine and cry cracks me up.  The ice road itself is pretty amazing.  When it starts melting, I don't know how these guys keep driving on it to get in their last loads... Overall, I would recommend it.",1224806400,8,341,4.28125

3515733,5,B001CQS7KG,We had purchased Season One for our uncle so we had to purchase Season Two!  It was so nice to find it available on Amazon!,1389657600,,123,3.92
3515734,5,B001CQS7KG,"Gritty, edgy, daring, testing the limits of driving over 3 to 4 feet of ice. Overall a terrific show to watch.",1389484800,,110,4.285714285714286
3515735,3,B001CQS7KG,"My husband has been a trucker for over 40 years. For me, 20, so we thought this might be a fun series to watch. The first series seemed ok but a little over-dramatic. By the second season, it was clear that this series was dramatized. Sadly, many people who don't have someone close to them who drives a semi will never know how dramatized it is.
The series makes you believe that this road is exclusive to certain drivers. Not at all, the case. Wyoming roads can be much worse than the footage for this series.
Still, it can be fun to watch if you're just looking for a little waste of time.",1388016000,,592,4.247787610619469
3515736,5,B001CQS7KG,"This show is awesome. My favorite is Alex and I really enjoyed watching it; however, I started out watching it streaming on instant video through Prime but halfway through it switched to ""have to pay."" I didn't get to finish the season and had to skip to season 3. I am somewhat disappointed with shows that are part of the prime subscription changing to pay halfway through the season. Anyway, I really enjoy this show and recommend it because it is pretty neat how it all works.",1376352000,,480,4.528735632183908
3515737,3,B001CQS7KG,I grew up in a truckers family the idea of driving on ice was a cool thought.  I just get tired of the continued kiddy fighting.  Show how they work the roads and the proffesionalism of the drivers and not the playground attitude,1374451200,,229,4.3023255813953485
3515738,3,B001CQS7KG,"While the episodes were different, the cast was the same as were the events pertaining to each driver. Did not know of Alex's problems until I saw this. The problem is the narration starts to get on my nerves. Tom Beers continually uses the same old phrases, the computer generated crashes are redundant and there are a lot of , ""could haves, or wold have""s involved, but none took place. All in all it was okay.",1374364800,,412,4.434210526315789
3515739,4,B001CQS7KG,"my husband and son have really enjoyed the episodes, Its wild and crazy, but they like it, also thanks for taking the bad language out, we appreciate that.",1373846400,,155,4.571428571428571
3515740,5,B001CQS7KG,I have actually been learning things I didn't know before and have enjoyed watching this season. Gas exploration is quite an expensive thing and I was happy to see how they endeavor to protect the environment (the tundra) while doing it. It is all quite a feat considering they only have a few months out of the year to do it.,1373760000,,326,4.360655737704918
3515741,5,B001CQS7KG,"Another great season of IRT! Alex and Hugh return but take on the ice roads of Alaska, including a stretch of ice over the Arctic Ocean. New characters include, Jack, a veteran of the Alaskan ice roads, Lisa, a young lady in her second year of driving the ice roads, trying to earn the respect of her fellow drivers, and a couple of other new minor players.

Alex and Hugh find themselves at a huge disadvantage as newcomers and are treated as rookies. Hugh's hard-driving demeanor and his arrogant attitude makes it hard for him to be accepted on the Alaskan roads. Alex, on the other hand, takes it all in stride, realizing there is a lot to learn and a lot more danger on the Alaskan roads. Lisa has a goal to make it to the ""heavy-haul"" team, and she struggles through the challenges, taking two giant steps forward and then one small step back. Jack, her mentor and friend, seems happy to teach her the skills and tricks that will help her advance her career. He is a very patient and cautious, yet determined man who faces each challenge with the confidence that only years of experience on the ice roads can give him. Another great season!",1372550400,,1146,4.483253588516747
3515742,5,B001CQS7KG,"I enjoyed the show, showing you from underwater how every truck compresses the ice as they go over it. I've only watched 2 seasons, need to catch up and watch the last 3.",1366156800,,170,4.181818181818182
3515743,4,B001CQS7KG,"Always interesting to see what they haul and how they do it.  Besides the bad language, it is pretty clean for the family.  Charactors are colorful, but I liked season 1 of ice truckers a little better than season 2.  But I think if your going to do this job you should get a special stamp in your man card.",1364515200,,307,4.083333333333333
3515744,5,B001CQS7KG,Interesting following the different truck drivers through the season. Enjoy all the Alaskan scenery .great series to watch on my kindle fire hd,1363737600,,143,5.260869565217392
3515745,4,B001CQS7KG,I have only seen the haul road during the summer. Wow during the winter I knew it would be tough. is there any more like Maya.,1363737600,,126,3.8846153846153846
3515746,5,B001CQS7KG,Season 2 was an excellent season for Ice Road Truckers besides the original drivers they introduced Eric Dufrane who ran a winch truck. It gave a view of what the oilfield in Canada is really like.,1363046400,,197,4.5
3515747,5,B001CQS7KG,This is something my whole family enjoys. We all can't wait to watch the next episode. Hope this show never goes off the air.,1360800000,,125,4.25
3515748,5,B001CQS7KG,"Again, i just marvel in the risks these men and women take every time they get in a big rig! I love to watch the drama they face every day. It is very entertaining as well! I hope they come out with more and more episodes every year! I will look forward to seeing them every weekend!",1360454400,,283,3.982456140350877
3515749,4,B001CQS7KG,My grandson is crazy about IRT and will love this DVD as a gift for Christmas. I haven't viewed it so can't speak of the quality. It arrived really quickly and in good condition.,1354147200,,178,4.264705882352941
3515750,5,B001CQS7KG,"the product was amazing, there is so much detail about every driver and about how they get the ice roads ready for driving on",1350691200,,125,4.25
3515751,5,B001CQS7KG,"I was hoping for a second season with the truckers hauling more goods back on the same roads as season 1, but these guys tend to go where they're needed, transporting supplies to the natural gas rigs ACROSS THE ARCTIC OCEAN!!! One of the rigs is a bust and is being relocated and these truckers are the ones who make the move driving over barely 35 inches of ice, which is all that stands between them and their 40-ton loads(sometimes heavier)and more than 120 feet of water. It isn't like Season 1, where there are ""land bridges"" and driving over 60-feet deep lakes. The entire ROUTE is nothing but the frozen waters of the MacKenzie River and the Arctic Ocean itself!

I was hoping that Drew would make a comeback much better than Season 1, but he ends up quitting on the first day due to his impatience in waiting for a load to come in, and ends up driving a box truck around town much of the time, but he DOES end up making 9 trips across the ice anyway in a semi-truck doing grocery runs. Some would call this rather pathetic comparing to what the other guys would haul, but people gotta eat too! And he still takes the risk of running through the ice especially when it gets warmer and the ice is melting everywhere.

Hugh made the most trips, an astonishing 67, and beating the top scorer there by one more load. Most of these trips were made with some kind of vacumn truck, a VAC truck as they call it, emptying waste tanks and stuff, and one review even criticized Hugh for not having the better loads, but he's getting paid just the same and also taking the same risks, and it's a big improvement to the environment considering that the waste tanks HAVE to be emptied somehow. Hugh will take the dirty jobs, but you can tell his pride won't let him go low enough to be like Drew going around town in a 1-ton box truck.

Alex is the one I was concerned about. He did some 20-odd trips across the ice, not complaining a single bit like Rick obviously was doing the entire season, and Alex was the one who wasn't in top shape with his health either. He gets lost across the ice missing a turn and doesn't even complain about that either! He only brought the matter of his declining health to the attention of the others when it was apparent that he couldn't make one more load without it being a serious hazard to his health with his increasing illness. He is evacuated and taken back to Yellowstone, the rest of the season being a washout for him. Hugh even shows great concern for his friend by showing up for him in the hospital to be by his side.

Rick was quite the restless one this season. He'd take his truck bouncing across the ice at excessive speeds. ""They told me to drive at whatever I was comfortable with."" he explains with a grin, and you see him bouncing around his cab at those speeds, but he didn't take into consideration the fact that his TRUCK wouldn't be as comfortable taking it to the limit on those roads, and he spends some time off the road while an oil pan replacement has to be flown in for his truck, a considerable delay. He complains about the delays, complains that he's not being treated fairly, and even while grudgingly doing jobs like hauling garbage and dirty snow, he even has a bit of a Good Samaritan in him as he goes out of his way to personally help out a fellow trucker who finds out his heater is no longer working in -40 temperatures. He shadows the guy's truck and stops several times with his truck as dead-weight on the ice so the distressed trucker can go to his cab and warm up instead of freezing to death. THAT is friendship right there! But Rick gets FIRED on the LAST DAY of the season due to his impatience when his incoming cargo for the last run can't seem to get onto his flatbed trailer. Should have learned to use a winch after all, right???
 I give this season 5 stars. And only because I can't put on six or seven stars. Quite enjoyable!",1335312000,,3909,4.327421555252387
3515752,5,B001CQS7KG,"It is interesting the way the roads are maintained and kept safe for the truckers.  The truckers are entertaining-- Hugh shows patience teaching a rookie trucker, is there to do the job with no complaints,  Alex has one liners and doesn't complain about anything. Then there is Drew who comes totally unprepared and thinks he is an actor.  Bad acting and whining that turns out to be comic. Rick whines throughout the show--more bad acting. Entertaining stuff.",1321488000,,460,4.9480519480519485
3515753,4,B001CQS7KG,I love the Ice Road truckers series that I am collecting all of the series. I have series 1-3 so far and I absolutely love them,1308960000,,127,3.923076923076923
3515754,4,B001CQS7KG,"Season two is my least favorite. Too much time is spent on bad attitudes or childish activities. I like the IRT series for the whine of truck engines, not the whine of drivers. It's still interesting and entertaining as truckers take giant loads onto river and sea ice. Just keep your remote handy so you can fast forward through the out-of-cab foolishness.",1303516800,,357,4.774193548387097
3515755,4,B001CQS7KG,This can be pretty tense watching these guys and gals drive huge loads of materials over roads that are lakes and rivers in the summer time. I enjoy watching the episodes except when an occasional driver starts whining about all the bad breaks he has gotten to make up for his screw-ups. Man up Drew.,1284076800,,300,4.472727272727273
3515756,5,B001CQS7KG,This dvd set is a must for anyone who has ever driven a big rig or anyone who has ever wanted to.  It gives a great view into the lifes of the men that risk it all for the money.  It shows the beauty of the north and also the dangers.  It takes you into the cab and out onto the road for a first hand look at what its all about in the race for the cash.,1269993600,,353,3.5
3515757,3,B001CQS7KG,"I was very interested in this series after spending 12 years of my life as a long hauler.  Aside from the pseudo dramatic overdone narration it is apparent that the producers know very little about the occupation of trucking.  True, it is dangerous, but the real problems that some of these guys faced had more to do with their ineptness in driving & understanding the equipment they use on a daily basis.  The idea that someone with years & years of experience can't down shift without mashing every gear is simply unbelievable.  The arrogance of the ""Polar Bear"" in his treatment of his hired drivers & lack of willingness to accept responsibility for his own behavior destroys his own credibility.  The only driver who knew what he was doing & did it well was is Jay.  To bad we don't have more like that.  For all of the critical comments, I did enjoy the show but please get another narrator!  aka Tenderfoot  p.s.  I was a lady driver & pulled flatbed with my own truck!",1263945600,10,976,4.525714285714286
