If you have never seen a complete performance by Cirque du Soleil, you probably
will not enjoy this video.",1366675200,,189,4.428571428571429
8423211,1,B004CLX7W6,"We bought a copy of this video at the retail store in the Bellagio hotel, Las Vegas after seeing the show. On our return home we tried to play it but it had nothing on it! We tried it on blu ray and on DVD and neither could play it...just kept whirring and trying to play. We have returned it for a replacement. Just wondering whether anyone else had a similar experience? Such a disappointment because we loved the show and were really looking forward to seeing this DVD..... Hopefully we will get the replacement soon.",1326326400,2,520,4.427083333333333
