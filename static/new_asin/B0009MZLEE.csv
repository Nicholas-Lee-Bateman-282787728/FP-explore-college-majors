8063342,5,B0009MZLEE,"This video of the Carol Burnett Show - volume 27 is exactly what I was looking for and everything is just right with it. So, since this is a review of the product - I must say the video is excellent.
I'm unhappy because I believe the seller was dishonest in their pricing. Originally the video was priced at $129. The price was raised to $150. I understood that there were no others available. I purchased the video for the $150 price. When I returned to Amazon a few days after the video arrived - there was another one listed - same seller - back at the $129 price.",1281830400,,567,4.2110091743119265

From 1974: Dame Maggie Smith (from the Harry Potter movies) is guest, as well as the hilarious Tim Conway. Included: A safari couple (Carol, Harvey) must return their spoiled pet lion (Tim) to the wild (watch as Carol & Harvey break up at the end); Carol & Maggie do a funny song about the differences between Americans & Britains; army buddies (Harvey, Tim) stationed in the jungle have their friendship changed when one gets promoted (a really wacky sketch); A couple (Carol, Harvey) invite their old friend turned movie star (Maggie) over, and are more interested in sordid Hollywood cliches than facts; a blond woman's (Vicki) confession to the police turns into ""Goldilocks & the Three Bears""; and in the finale, Carol's ""cleaning lady"" character dreams of being in a lavish movie musical.
From 1976: The multi-talented Rita Moreno is guest. Included: A royal couple's (Carol, Harvey) daughter (Vicki) brings home her oddly-familiar fiancee (Tim); Rita sings & dances; a disgraced officer (Harvey) is stripped of rank, with the commanding officer (Tim) having trouble stripping his uniform; an accident-prone woman (Carol) is assigned a nurse (Rita) who's more harmful than helpful; a bank teller trainee & trainer (Vicki, Carol) are held up by a robber trainee & trainer (Tim, Harvey); and in a musical-comedy finale, Carol, Vicki & Rita play daydreaming restaurant dishwashers.
Another enjoyable ""Carol Burnett Show"" volume with quality that looks as if these two shows were filmed yesterday!",1262822400,2,1535,5.218623481781377
