8420830,1,B004ASYAAY,"This is a review of ""Triumph of the Will"" sold by Tyr Productions, aka NS88 Videos. The adage ""you get what you pay for"" was never more true than for this product. This is a home-copied disc with a hand-written label, and the quality is terrible. There are numerous skips and freezes throughout the disc, the film is out of synch with the sound (voices) by almost a second, and the picture is cut off on all four sides (this affects the subtitles). Better to spend your money on a higher quality version.",1321660800,,504,4.43010752688172
