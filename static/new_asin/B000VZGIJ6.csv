I believe there are all type of races and beings that occasionally frequent the earth or watch over and others that have bases and dwell within it all of different nautures and motives. In his take he refers to it as ""them"" or ""they"" and then us. As if they're all one and the same. I think its a matter of ego distortion. If you're not that bright you could easily be mislead, or just confirm your own doubts or debates. In these dvds he basically presents his envolvement with whatever he does and a basic over view of the situation. In this dvd he talks about nasa and their issues, global warming, and politics.",1209254400,2,777,4.256756756756757
