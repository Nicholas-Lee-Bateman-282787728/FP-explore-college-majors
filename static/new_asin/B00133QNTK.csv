3101842,3,B00133QNTK,"I enjoyed some of this low budget film.  There were a lot of fun and quirky moments.  I am not an overly religious person but I found the nasty remarks about Mary and Jesus to be mean spirited.  I realize that the movie has to be over the top for it's subject matter but it seems like it went out of it's way to paint all Christians as being hypocrites.  It also portrayed Gays as being intolerant of people who were religious.  Sort of a Homophobic vs. anti Christian mentality.  But I did give it three stars. I did like the Margaret character very much though. I wish she had more screen time. The director's other movie ""Angora Ranch"" was so much more fun and genuine.",1352592000,2,672,4.2936507936507935
3101843,5,B00133QNTK,This is a very touching and moving movie about a young gay man who lives in the hill country of Texas. The way he finally addresses his sexuality and goes on to lead a full life is more in line with reality than the usual Hollywood dramas. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend a romantic evening with their partner watching a movie by the fire with a glass of wine.,1279238400,,380,4.148648648648648
3101844,4,B00133QNTK,"Gentle, unassuming bar worker Guy suddenly finds himself in the middle of a conflict he never asked for when he discovers he is the owner of a small-town gay bar in the heart of Texas.

Thus is the basic premise of Paul Bright's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angora-Ranch/dp/B000I2J5TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angora Ranch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aaron-Albeit-a-Sex-Hero/dp/B002U1LGS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aaron...Albeit a Sex Hero</a>) ""Theft,"" a fairy tale that involves drag queens, leathermen, small town prejudice and bizarrely twisted family ties.

It is a fun romp through a tough topic. Bright, whose initial film Angora Ranch has become a sleeper hit since its DVD release, has crafted a script that mixes topical barbs with goofy comedy. Once Guy realizes that he has inherited the Golden Door Bar, George/Sister Hosanna (David DeLuca) convinces him to stand up for the community, even when the Bible Thumping Hypocrite Sister Susannah (a spot on Cynthia Schiebel) begins attacking The Golden Door and those who would patronize the place. Of course, like most bashers, the sister has other agendas and is more than willing to cast stones. As the community pushes back, she pushed harder...and so the fun carries on.

This is a positive movie about gays, and has less to do with Christian Bashing than it does with making a statement about Christian Hypocrisy. The dueling ""Onward Christian Soldiers"" scene illustrate this point wonderfully and still gets a laugh in the process. It's hard to say more without giving away the best parts of the movie, but as he did in ""Angora Ranch,"" Bright's script takes on gay topics without getting too overtly cliched all while staying positive. It presents leathermen as non-threatening (the total reverse of Cruising) and dreams of a world where this smalltown gay bar would thrive and foster a sense of community...AND take on crazy church ladies.

3101863,5,B00133QNTK,"Just finished watching ""Theft (Of The Drag Queen's Wig), a Paul Bright movie, released by Water Bearer Films.
Now in the interest of fair disclosure, Paul Bright and I are friends on Facebook, even though we have never met in person - perhaps one day....
""Theft (Of The Drag Queen's Wig) was the second feature length movie that Paul wrote, directed, and produced back in 2008.  [Catch Paul as a heckler in the opening scene at a leather bar - he's a hoot.]
Like any great comedy movie, this scene opens with a death scene - the owner of The Golden Door - a leather bar in small Texas town has a heart attack and dies on stage while trying to raise money for a worthy charity.
Handyman, accountant, and all round gopher Guy ends up as owner of the bar - something he doesn't want.
Enter a mysterious drifter who is not only a talented graffiti artist; but has a secret connection to one of the town's most prominent residents.
Also enter the scheming Christian Sister Susannah, who wants The Golden Door so that she can turn it into a television station to rival that of the fell from Grace Bakers; and who will stop at absolutely nothing to get it.
Paul Bright created a good old fashioned slapstick comedy for his second movie that is a chuckle-fest.  Bright takes a few risks by letting some of his characters grow and move on in unexpected ways.  Mild spoiler alert - the ending is happy,but not what you expect.
Strongly Recommended!
