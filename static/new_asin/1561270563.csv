183073,2,1561270563,"Pique Dame is indeed a great opera, perhaps Tchaikovsky's finest, and this production has it's good points.  The acting and staging are often compelling.  Nancy Gustafson is a joy to watch and hear as Lisa.  Felicity Palmer is wonderful as the old countess, and both Tomsky and Yeletski are well sung.  Yuri Marusin's Herman is well acted and the tenor seems thoroughly to understand the psychological nuances of this central character, however, Mr. Marusin's eccentric singing style and horrible intonation completly undermine his performance.  No matter how dramatic the interpretation, it is necessary for the tenor to sing at least some of the notes on pitch. One wonders in the duets how Nancy Gustavson coped with him. (He does much better in the Vienna State Opera production of Khovanshchina on DVD which I recommend.) I have no aversion to surrealistic sets, except that these are memorably unattractive as is the lighting.  The staging of the musically delightful pastorale in the second act is rendered uncommonly silly by the presence of dancing green sheep!  Too much of this production is hard to look at and painful to the ears.",1084406400,12,1143,5.047872340425532

183075,5,1561270563,"This set is a pleasant surprise to those who prefer to have their Russian operas performed by an all-Russian cast, on a large Russian stage (the Bolshoi is allegedly the largest in the world) in a classical Russian  production. I thought I could not enjoy Russian opera any other way until I  watched this DVD. Glyndebourne productions are on a small scale. This  enables you to savor this opera from an uncharacteristic intimate  perspective. The three major male singers are Russian. Dimitri Kharitonov's  Prince Yeletsky is noble and quite touching in his sorrow after he loses  Lisa. Sergei Leiferkus' resounding baritone is very impressive (he is Iago  in Domingo's last and best Otello set). But the real story is the tenor  Yuri Marusin. Together with Leiferkus he was one of the stars of the Kirov  in Leningrad, but here he goes in a very untraditional direction and  experiments quite boldly with the role of Herman. Marusin projects Herman's  sociopathy and ""horrifying descent into madness"" by a variety of singing  and acting techniques, the most daring of which in my opinion is his choice  of singing large parts of the role flat, with no vibrato. It lends the  voice a hostile-defiant-mad quality. Even though it occasionally sacrifices  the simple beauty of the musical line, it enables him to shade his voice in  every possible way to express the drama. It also serves to adapt as well as  to take advantage of the intimate dimensions of the production (which is  staged in box-like sets). I believe it also helps him to survive Andrew  Davis' conducting. His tempi are generally slow, exceptionally so where  Herman's role is concerned. The role of Herman is quite large, he has  almost an hour of singing, and subjecting him to such slow tempi is cruel  and unusual punishment.  The female singers are impeccable. It is a matter  of personal taste whether the lack of the unique Slavonic timbre or the  diction matters. Much has been written about the abstract modern sets. The  audio and video quality are very good.",952387200,38,2037,4.883040935672515

7796133,5,1561270563,"This was the last production in the 'old' Glyndebourne- indeed the last note of music played there. I was incredibly fortunate to hear it live - the most electrifying live opera I have ever heard. I had never heard it.before.attending the live performance. I think it is a supreme masterpiece, better than Eugene Onegin. Be sure to buy the PAL DVD (if you can get it and view it) as it is much better than the NTSC version. I have both. Strangely the US DVD release came many months before the UK release. A great advantage in retrospect of the old house was that there was no room for both TV cameras and audience. This allowed this version to be directed and balanced for  video/TV. Marusin was breathtakingly dramatic and described as the tenor 'Callas' by a producer. I totally disagree with the negative comments about his singing. Beware the VHS I have seen had no subtitles, but, of course, the DVDs do. Recaptures the event so vividly for me. The best opera on video I have yet seen. Mesmerising.

London Philharmonic in the 'pit'- world class orchestra. Sir Andrew Davis took this production to Chicago - 1992 I believe.

7796135,5,1561270563,"Sometimes one loves a performance while recommending it cautiously, which is what I must do today. The outstanding elements from Glyndebourne 1992, those that most lift this PIKOVAYA DAMA/PIQUE DAME/QUEEN OF SPADES out of the ordinary, are the classic production by Graham Vick and the lead performance by Russian tenor Yuri Marusin as Ghermann. The former I praise without reservation. There would come a time when designs such as these by Richard Hudson, angled and skewed sets for a ""descent into madness"" opera (this one, LUCIA, PURITANI, OTELLO, et cetera), with the surroundings intended to reflect a protagonist's weakening grip on reality, would become a clich&eacute;. Here, the trend was in its infancy, and Vick and Hudson manage arresting visual perspectives. The production is period-accurate, beautifully costumed and atmospherically lit. In collaboration with Vick, most of the cast is inspired to detailed acting of the kind that plays very well in a close-up format. Comparison of Nancy Gustafson's Liza and Felicity Palmer's Countess with those of fine singers Emily Magee and Ewa Podle on a recent DVD from Barcelona is a lesson in the benefits of strong direction. The Glyndebourne women are far subtler, less operatically generalized, infinitely more telling and three-dimensional. When the small behavioral moments are made to count, the big moments -- for example, Gustafson's Liza doffing her cloak and throwing herself into the river -- have greater impact.

The performance by Yuri Marusin is sure to polarize, and it is important to acknowledge that the sounds he makes are by no means beautiful. There is nothing fraudulent about Marusin, an experienced singer with a prestigious career still ongoing. But here, he is allowed to pursue daring vocal choices that will not be to all tastes: intentionally singing much of the role flat; manipulating the larynx to create a white, pressured, vibrato-free tone; moving from note to note in a slithery fashion and preceding some notes with an unsettling ""yawn."" He has a lot to say about this character, and all his vocal eccentricities combine with uninhibited, unedited acting to create a memorable portrayal of self-indulgence, obsession, and ultimately madness. For the duration of the opera, it seems to me that he *is* Ghermann, more than some singers on rival DVDs who are on better vocal behavior (Gegam Grigorian at the Kirov, Misha Didyk in Barcelona). Marusin's demented cackling at the end of Act III Scene 1, the moment we understand Ghermann has irrevocably lost his mind, is a chilling episode.

This strange and singular lead performance is near-ideally supported. Nancy Gustafson does lovely, expressive work as Liza; from the start, one likes and worries for this sweet, grave young woman. Felicity Palmer knows there is more to be gotten out of the Countess than scenery-chewing caricature. Only in her forties at the time, she is convincingly aged with bad teeth and thinning hair, and she has plenty of voice -- the singing, acting, and direction make Palmer's, along with Irina Bogacheva's in the Lev Dodin Paris production, the most satisfying performance of this role on DVD. Marie-Ange Todorovich is another excellent video-immortalized Polina, and doubles as Milovzor in the pastorale episode. Baritone Sergei Leiferkus also does double duty there as Zlatogor. This is one of three DVDs, all from 1992, in which he sings his main role, the hero's confidant Tomsky, and he is consistent across all three, a scrupulous musician with the right soldierly bearing, knowing how to phrase, color, and accent to enliven a narrative. The haunting timbre, a trifle lispy, gives his Act I solo filling in the Countess's history the quality of a great ghost story. Dimitri Kharitonov, by contrast, is a bit pallid as  Yeletsky. He makes a handsome appearance, but his acting is more diffident than anyone else's, and he does not make as much of a glorious romantic wallow of the character's famous love song as do Dmitri Hvorostovsky (a live broadcast from the Met, not on DVD) and Ludovic Tezier (two DVDs, Paris and Barcelona).

Andrew Davis's conducting is less revelatory than apposite, canny. One has a sense of all the disparate elements of this challenging score being well managed, well integrated, seamless. The London Philharmonic plays its best for him; the Glyndebourne Chorus sings out lustily, coping with the language. I quite liked the ""authentic"" ragged ensemble of a very charming youth contingent for the soldier play of the first scene (contrasting with better-drilled counterparts in Barcelona and elsewhere). Video director Peter Maniura is strikingly alert, a real collaborator. Sound and picture are dated in predictable ways for a now-20-year-old video.

This is the best performance of QUEEN OF SPADES on DVD, the most intense, the most theatrical. While I sympathize with anyone wary of Marusin's challenging singing in the principal role, I am not sure what to recommend as an alternative. All other performances have major problems. I find the 1992 Gergiev/Kirov performance (Philips) competent but stodgy, lots of standing and singing in traditional settings. A 1992 Vienna DVD conducted by Ozawa (Sony) has a tempting cast including Freni, Atlantov, and M&ouml;dl, but is ruled out for me by deep cuts to the score, and also is not much to look at. Lev Dodin's production for Paris (TDK) is splendidly sung, played, and acted, and Bogacheva's Countess is especially vivid, but the director sets the entire opera in an asylum, with confusing and monotonous results. The newest DVD, the Barcelona (Opus Arte), may be a ""safe"" choice -- traditionally sumptuous and colorful, with some great voices, but the quality of the miking does not always flatter those voices, and again the stage direction is indifferent. More than any of those, I would like to recommend the Met's 1999 television broadcast. Here, Gergiev had a better cast than his earlier one at the Kirov, with Domingo scoring a late-career triumph as Ghermann, and Elijah Moshinsky's long-serving production has both traditional opulence and astute observation. This, however, continues to be a mystifying non-release.",1384560000,4,6194,5.221105527638191
7796136,5,1561270563,"I purchased thus performance after reading the reviews here and the review in the Gramaphone Classical Music Guide 2008 (which was favourable!). I was concerned because some of the reviewers here complained about Yuri Marusin's off-pitch singing in the main role of Herman. There are brief passages where Marusin sings in key, which are quite thrilling, and his off-pitch singing is obviously deliberate, a means for getting inside the melancholic and depressed psychology of the hero of the opera as he descends into madness. The vocal approach Marusin adopted in this role mimics the wallowing, self-pitying, obsessive aspect of Tchaikovsky's music, which gives it such power and originality. Marusin's performance is therefore not only psychologically true to the character he is playing, it is also true to the spirit of Tchaikovsky's music. The other singers are excellent and sing in a conventional and expected way, but with feeling. They are a nice counterpart for Marusin's brilliant and electrifying singing. If you want an outstanding performance of a gripping opera, have no hesitation in buying this DVD.",1270857600,4,1117,5.3522727272727275
7796137,5,1561270563,"Graham Vick's production is very effective.  It combines abstract/expressionistic sets with elaborately detailed and sumptuous costumes.  This approach avoids busy-ness and kitsch while still giving an atmospheric feel.  The direction of the crowds, especially in the last scene, is really wonderful.  He combines naturalistic acting with occasional freeze frame type poses and it always works.  The singers really, really act well.  This is a total theatre experience.  I have seen parts of the Gergiev dvd on youtube and it really doesn't compare theatrically to this one, although musically it is great.  Vick's productions are almost always wonderful that way and take 'music theatre' to a new level.  On the musical side, this production is entirely satisfactory, in my opinion.  The conductor is less exciting, maybe, but the music still comes through.  Difficult parts such as the quintet in the first act are handled very cleanly.  I was not bothered by Marusin's singing in the lead role, as some reviewers are.  He sometimes gives his voice a sort of 'constricted' sound, and it maybe works less well in the love music than in the other parts of his role, but it is just a part of how he portrays the character and the music always comes through well in any case.  Marusin was actually very famous in this role and sang it everywhere.  Gustafson is not often recorded, and as Lisa she is a great actress with a sweet if small scale voice.  Most of the other principals are Russian.  Feclicity Palmer's countess is breathtaking in her big confrontation with Ghermann: she just stares at him in total puzzlement--it is very effective.  Her voice has a rich, commanding sound.

I will probably never be able to see this opera on stage, so I am glad to own such a perfect dvd of it.

Incidentally, on youtube there are clips of Domingo's Hermann with Galina Gorchakova as Lisa and the rest of a great case at the Met.  I wish the Met would release that performance on dvd as well, since the Moshinsky production is good and the singing and acting is first class.",1259452800,4,2068,4.818181818181818
7796138,5,1561270563,"I am writing this review to counter the bad ones here.  This is a great production, both vocally and theatrically.  The director's concept is wonderful and the singers are great.  I recommend this DVD over any other one of this opera.  What a joy.",1197849600,4,247,4.545454545454546
7796139,4,1561270563,"This is from a live performance at Vienna State Opera in 1992. Very dark staging. Very good musical performance. Very morbid story.... compounded by the lack of subtitle (you've better know the story before hand or understand Russian).

All the principals are wonderful. Vladimir Atlantov owned 'Hermann' and is most convincing. I dislike this character, but Atlantov is so compelling that I have to keep watching. He has big voice and he uses it well. Mirella Freni sounds 10 years younger than she looks and is a sympathetic 'Lisa.' Vladimir Chernov is also a very handsomely sung 'Prince Yeletsky' and sneers very royally. The young Vesselina Kasarova makes good impression in the cameo of 'Pauline', though dances a bit awkwardly (who cares..., nothing awkward comes out of her mouth when she sings).

But the opera stealer is Martha Moedl's 'Old Countess'. Utterly shockingly creepy... the voice is shredded but the way she uses it is strangely haunting... and as hoarse as it is, it carries somehow.

Very good performance of a morbidly haunting opera. No subtitle, though... and mine doesn't come with any synopsis either.",1169251200,4,1129,5.091891891891892
7796140,5,1561270563,"As others have noted Marusin's singing is often a terrifying struggle to get on key--but except in a few instances, it pays off with an incredibly powerful performance.

7796141,1,1561270563,"the tenor, Marusin, is more than enough reason not to bother buying or watching this DVD. He is constantly off key. Herman is the character that carries the opera so, as goes Marusin, so goes this rendition.",1116547200,6,207,4.621621621621622
