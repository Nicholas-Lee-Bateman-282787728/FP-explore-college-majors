8721522,4,B001D787WM,"In lucid video commentary, ""Coming of Age in Africa: Initiation in the Bwa Village of Dossi"" brings the art and performance tradition of an African culture to life. It is a useful instructional tool in the classroom, particularly for scholars of traditional African art. It shows art, performance and rites of passage, the transformation of the Bwa person from childhood to adulthood.  In addition, it offers useful insights on circumscribing social mores among the Bwa, including the construction of gender roles among young and old. In a few sequences, performers in the video speak French (official language of Burkina Faso), but English voiceover and supporting subtitles in those parts aptly enable a seamless viewing experience.",1243555200,4,734,5.3826086956521735
