7956912,5,B00005YF2L,"Just as a prophet of his own religion, Celi taught those who wanted to absorb his teachings free of charge. This revelation goes to the heart of the character that was Celi: free to do as he saw it to be true, not as he should have because the rules said it. He wasn't an easy teacher. He wasn't out there to win a popularity contest. Clear on his mission, he was out there to share his vision. It wasn't easy being his student either. To those strong enough to stick with him, he opened the doors to a different experience. A life changing one, to their own admission.

The book and the DVD complement each other well. The misspellings don't detract from the richness in content.

Serge Ioan, Celibidache the Young, the director, did a well rounded job in presenting a slice of Celibidache the Old - the conductor, the teacher, the philosopher. And luckily, he did it in time.

Just in time.

His father's message wasn't for the music world alone. In a time when free thinking is rapidly and irrevocably disappearing, he made an appeal to upkeep that sharp spiritual torch alive and healthy.

For, in the process, it builds character in humans and might shatter a few walls between them.",1139443200,5,1188,4.5327102803738315
7956913,5,B00005YF2L,"At a conceptual level, this DVD is about Celibidache's take on the relationships  between master and apprentice, music and its enablers, tension and resolve. Such as approached by Celibidache, these are relationships of unity whose entities resemble Yin and Yang. Sviatoslav Richter, elsewhere, put it similarly when revealing what he considered to be an achievement in painting: to be able to draw a full circle. So, Celibidache's unities are equivalent to Richter's full circle!
This DVD, with the book titled Celibidache!, offers a remarkable perspective into the iconic personality of the late Maestro Celibidache. The overall statement of the package (DVD+book) is rather remarkable--profound and honest.
The English subtitles on the DVD are mostly accurate. Few errors of translation made it into e.g. Celibidache's particular opinion about the American interprets of classical music is translated as an opinion about interprets of classical music in general.
The book is rather simple--alas misspelled. It contributes a lot less to the economy of the package compared to the DVD yet it is still worth having.
Watching this DVD, I became aware of the source of some unjust characterizations of Celibidache--chief amongst being Lebrecht's in Maestro's Myth. But, not unlike most great personalities/works Celi/this DVD feeds detractors as well as the rest.",1062806400,9,1361,5.543269230769231
