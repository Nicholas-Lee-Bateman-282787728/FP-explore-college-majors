I had my agent pull my contract for this piece of work. Unfortunately, I can not disclose any information about The Duggy Show, all inheritance parts of the ""Dream Team"" (including Mechanic Mac and Controller Josie),  and Mitch Carley LLC.

I have had fans ask me to do a, ""Reddit, Tell All- Q&A session"" but again this would be violating my contract. However, I can talk about my adaptation of the character, ""Matt""..
When I was first asked to play him, I was overwhelmed with the diversity that I would to need to bring to the table.
I heard the first offered the part to Channing Tatum but he backed out of the project because of creative differences and his overall lack of range.

After the first read, I thought to myself, wow.. Matt stands as shining example of the transformative qualities of ambition and hard work..

I had a chance to sit down with the producers, director, and language coach during pre-production meetings. We had a great opportunity  to capture the tempo of this diverse character. We concluded that if I was going bring justice to Matt, I would have to use Strasbergs Methodology to compress Leo's intensity, mixed with Joaquin Phoenix's pace but yet splash in Benicio Del Toro's mannerisms into one without overlooking Matt's dedication to his craft.
To say that it was exhausting would be an understatement. It was apparent that some of the cast and crew felt uncomfortable around me because I had to stay in-character between takes. Matt wasn't exactly an easy character to snap in and out of at the drop of a hat. The narrative of the show was to live clean, tenacious and grateful life so naturally there were kids and parents on set and I just remember having so much energy at all times it was actually draining everyone else on set.

Playing a full-bodied character like that was so rounded is once in a life time experience.
But I learned so much from this work and very grateful to be part of it.

To address the Christopher Nolan and The Dark Knight Rises rumors. Yes, those were all true. I never had the chance to talk to Nolan but after playing Matt, I thought it was apparent that I was the only option .. I recall talking to my agent and at the time other projects kept coming in that never really panned out and the Robin role slipped through the cracks.
I was waiting for my phone to ring and I looked on IMDB and somehow, Gordon-Levitt weaseled his way on the the line. I was told by many sources that it was due to a Hollywood political scandal.
I mean, we all saw the movie and all the reviews were pointing to the same conclusion.. JGL basically ruined it.. It was coming off the Dark Knight, biggest movie on the planet with a great set. But somehow he managed to ruin the entire movie and some say the entire franchise.
I have had a couple screen writers come to me now, looking to fix the Robin story-line that JGL botched. I will certainly be putting my hat in the ring for that role when the time is right.
The biggest take away I personally learned from the Duggy Show is to Dream it, Team it and work it with Duggy!
- So, as long as myself and all the fans keep believing I should be Robin.. I will work it with Duggy to make it come true!",1514851200,,3260,4.423333333333333
