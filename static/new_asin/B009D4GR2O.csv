Music by The Klezmer Conservatory Band</a>&nbsp;I just had to pick up another Rabbit Ears story, which was called ""East of the Sun West of the Moon.""  This was yet another Rabbit Ears story that has been a staple of my childhood and also one I've been DYING to see on DVD, which my wish came true (and pretty soon, I'll be grabbing all of these Rabbit Ears beauties when I get the chance to)!

""East of the Sun West of the Moon"" was told in a much more dramatic and sophisticated way that really made feel like I'm living in this MAGICAL world that is inhabited by these glorious characters!  Max Von Sydow's narration was truly magnificent to hear as he was able to bring so much drama and intensity to the story and I was LITERALLY sitting on the edge of my seat trying to see if the girl in the story would rescue her prince from the troll queen.  I also loved the artwork done by Vivienne Flesher as they were GORGEOUS to look at and it made me float on the clouds above!  All in all, ""East of the Sun West of the Moon"" is a truly wonderful video to watch if you love watching stories that deal with romance, Scandinavian folklore and magic all around!",1522540800,,1487,5.048979591836734
