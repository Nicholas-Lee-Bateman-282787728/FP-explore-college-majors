4702127,5,B005HMHPE0,"Best season yet Hank is one of the greatest characters ever created, his don't care attitude is wonderful. I don't condone his actions however. The only draw back is that Karen is really starting to become annoying, her heart must be as black as coal not to take Hank back, he tries so hard (in his own screw up way) to please her. Oh well cant wait for season 5.",1321401600,,363,4.2
4702128,4,B005HMHPE0,"I just finished watching Season 4 of Californication and although in my opinion not the best of the seasons, it is still filled with many laugh-out loud, outrageous moments that will keep die-hard Hank Moody fans begging for a 5th season. The 4th Season is primarily focused on Hank battling against accusations of rape pending from his escapade with Mia. His best friend and agent Charlie is getting along after being separated from Marci and is attempting to sleep with 100 women before he dies---problem is he is only up to #11 when the show starts. As the season progresses, you start to feel as if the show is getting slightly old and that if it is to continue it may need a radical makeover. The development of Hank's character as tragic starts to get tired, his moments of self-reflection old, and you continuously wait for some sort of big ""bang"" to happen to jolt you and Hank and the rest of the characters out of a bit of a slumber. Without giving away the ending of Season 4, I will say that it is not as dramatic as the previous seasons although does involve a ride into the sunset by both Hank and his ex-wife and daughter---although not in the same car. A good but not great or memorable season for Californication lovers.",1319932800,2,1237,4.526785714285714
4702129,5,B005HMHPE0,"This show is so Brilliant, original and keeps it real. Just when you feel like ""I want that life"", the writers (and actors) give a 'real-does' of reality. This is what happens in real life and that is why I am a big fan of the show and all the cast members. Season 4 is great and I am so happy it is now available. I also want to thank Showtime for airing this show. They are the only True network for entertainment. All the other shows offered on Showtime air are great too (see the website and you will find out).

4702131,5,B005HMHPE0,"Californication ended with a BANG and not a whimper in it's 4th season! This season still packed alot of punches to it in it's self-aware parody of the man that would rather have an awkward morning than a lonely night. Before I knew of this show, I had not come across a show this realistic, yet hilariously original in a long time, & I doubt I will again for even longer! If this truly is the last season as they say, you will be greatly missed Hank Moody. I would say more, but what's the point? If you people aren't interested & watching this show 100X more than GLEE, then the apocalypse has already happened and you're all dead on the inside anyway.",1318982400,3,654,4.32520325203252
4702132,5,B005HMHPE0,"I've watched the show from the beginning and let me tell you this, Season 4 makes the difference. I think, disaccording with the reviewer before me, that Season 4 gets really deep into the Hank Moody character. You watch it and judge yourself. Enjoy!",1316044800,5,250,4.704545454545454
4702133,4,B005HMHPE0,"For me, Californication has always been a story about the real, and not just real people, but REAL everything. Everything that happens on this show I could very well see happening in reality, especially given the setting in which it takes place in. And that's one of the many reasons why I love it and why I can connect with it on a personal level. For the majority of the show and its seasons thus far, Californication has mostly taken on a dark-comedic edge and while maintaining a serious edge throughout its plot threads, most of the time we're left laughing hysterically at the insanity the characters fall into(most of the time at their own faults).

Season 4 changes all that. And it does so near perfectly. This season takes a turn for the worse in that Hank faces the real-life consequences for his actions in prior seasons, and if anyone knows anything about character development and progression of story, a pivotal point in every story's duration is the point in which the characters feel truly lost and all hope has failed them. That's essentially what Season 4 has to offer. It's a dark time for Hank, and doesn't offer nearly as many laughs as Seasons 1 through 3.

So for anyone who's walking into this season with high expectations, you should still have them; this show is still as genius as ever, just take it with a grain of salt. It may take a few viewings to fully grasp that you're watching a drama moreover a comedy this time around. Can't wait for Season 5!",1314835200,25,1482,4.567669172932331
4702134,3,B005HMHPE0,"""Californication"" has become a disappointment. Sure, there are some hysterical moments in Season 4 (most of which involve Rob Lowe), but the big problem with this show is that there are quickly becoming fewer and fewer reasons to like the character of Hank Moody. In this season, Hank faces statutory rape charges, but because of the situation, it really isn't his fault and viewers don't hate him for what happened with Mia. However, his constant drunkenness, lack of concern for his teenage daughter, constant couplings with less than admirable women, and general inadequateness make it very hard to feel sorry for this guy. I almost don't want Hank and Karen to end up together because her character is so amazing and she could do so, so, SO much better than Hank! We'll see what Season 5 brings.",1301184000,18,799,4.839416058394161

A nice  Cameo  by Rob Lowe  and a few others that  round out this season focused in on  Hank's life at the "" Chateau Marmont.""  How very cool...how very LA ...

I always loved the fact that below the behavioral extremities Hank was an honorable guy. By the end of Season 3 there wasn't much honor left. I decided to give Season 4 a chance and found myself re-hooked. And Hank is still an honorable guy.

More than any other character I have ever encountered - fictional, historical, literary or other media - Hank loves women in the same way I do. Whoever writes his character has a direct sync with my own predilections. If you wonder if Hank is real you can know that at least one real human thinks very much like him.

I also enjoy the frank and unmodulated portrayal of masculine men.",1465689600,,739,4.548872180451128

Although I'm going to stop watching at this point, my prediction going forward is that Michael Ealy's character will continue to remain under developed in comparison to white actors on the show. In each scene, he will have the least amount of dialogue and his character will always be referred to in some type of reference connected to race.

Hank continues to prove his point of how much an idiot he is while showing little to no remorse for any of his actions.  There's little to no plot development, and the story-line clings to an overabundance of sex and drug use.  The lead characters seem almost bi-polar.  One moment they are tearing each other apart, and the next second they are slinging cheesy casual conversation leading to an up-close scene of romantic struggle fluff that is just hard to watch without checking the time.

However I still watch each episode out of desperate optimistic hope that it's just a rough patch for the writers and I'll start to see again some of the traits that previously made me love the show.  So far this whole season has been a disappointment though.",1450569600,,865,4.726666666666667

Most of the woman with the daughter in particular tend to add a humans to Hank who uses people and takes no responsibility.  Not realistic he cannot attract so many woman of all ages.

For my husband and I, it was fine. David Duchovny is brilliant and the supporting cast couldn't be better. Natscha McElhone is perfect as Hank Moody's love interest and the chemistry between Hank and Karen is undeniably the hottest I've seen on any tv show ever.

I cheated myself of some of the best work on Television at the time. Breaking far, far away from his paranoid, driven role on The X Files, David is utterly believable, even to his characters almost impossible sexual success with women. I loved every unbelievable minute of this series, and, while the first season was absolute perfection as a stand alone item, the writers manage to keep the ball in the Air season after season.

Also, the male behavior in the TV show reminds of the lifestyle and mentality of a lot of men in L.A. and San Francisco which is interesting. They do capture a very realistic but sad view of today's male and female society... BUT it does get old too. Its like...really??? Gross! Grow Up!",1390867200,,673,4.616666666666666

After signing up, all these shows aren't really free, even for the first 30 days. The only free videos are a few short interviews, which are not that interesting. However, I decided to watch ""Californication: Home Sweet Home"" due to the fact that a hot Asian (Taiwanese) chick, Camille Chen, was a co-star in the thirty-minute film.

Overall, the show/film is average. Camille is sexy in other TV shows and commercials, but she doesn't look that good in this cable TV series. What a disappointment! The worst part is that she plays a hooker and get screwed by an old guy. This can happen to any unknown actresses who want to make it in Hollywood.",1354838400,,742,4.578947368421052

David Duchovny is Hank Moody inside and out. He's funny, apologetic or tries to be, he's human who makes a ton of idiotic mistakes.

4702533,4,B005HMHPE0,"The train wreck that is Hank Moody's life continues to hurl ahead at full speed in the fourth season of Showtime's raunchfest, Californication.  The latest installment in the chronicles of the deeply flawed author finds him dealing with statutory rape charges stemming from an encounter with Mia way back in the first season.  One of the great things about this show has always been how its characters are haunted by their past transgressions and its good to see the series getting back to exploring this theme after the largely consequence free romp that was season three.

The twelve episodes of this latest season are wildly entertaining and often jaw droppingly vulgar (see the story arc involving Charlie and his realtor for further proof of this), but they are also frequently shot through with sobering flashes of sadness, regret and heartache.  For every fling that Hank engages in and every bit of booze and drugs he consumes, a part of the man he desperately wants to be seems to drift farther away.  What's most tragic about this is that Hank knows it's happening but seems unable or unwilling to make the changes needed to become the person he truly wants to be.

Yet Californication continues to brilliantly convey these themes in the guise of a series that is loose, fun and endlessly amusing.  It conveys an effortless sense of cool and good times, even though things are falling apart beneath the surface.  Just like Hank Moody himself.",1323648000,3,1452,4.873983739837398

4702535,3,B005HMHPE0,Well first i have to say Amazon delivered fast as always =). I love Amazon =). Back to Cali season 4 though.... I don't know what it is with this show but the seasons are WAY too short. Show time is just sucking the money out of people who like the show. They basically turned 1 season into two by making it 12 episodes per season. That's why I've turned to watching Fringe where you get a nice helping of like 20-24 seasons per episode and I feel that's worth my money. So since i feel like Californication season 4 didn't improve I don't know if I'd buy a season 5 if they make one.,1322956800,,584,4.086956521739131
