5115550,5,B00803PFXG,"A good movie floats my boat and here are 3 good ones.  I'm not a big collector of DVD's but when a good deal like this one comes along, I can't resist.  After watching Taking Care of Business it takes 3 days to get the song out of my head!!!  Entertaining and that's all I want from these movies.",1355616000,,296,3.983050847457627

5115552,5,B00803PFXG,"bought this for Hello Again, the story line not plausible of bringing someone back after death, but this movie is a riot, some great laughsand one is sympathetic for Shelly Longs' character, Corbin Bernsesn is great as the husband, soon not to be, and judith Ivey is fabulous as the altrnative health and occult shop owner.
Taking Care  of Business is one of James Belushi's funniest, and Mr Destiny is for anyone that loves baseball.",1354924800,,434,4.786666666666667

5115606,5,B00803PFXG,A great collection of James Belushi movies. I have always loved the movie Mr. Destiny and this triple feature was less expensive than the one movie by itself. I am very happy I made this purchase. Now only if they made it Blu-Ray.,1408320000,,230,4.372093023255814

5115621,4,B00803PFXG,I thought this was a funny and enjoyable movie. It is a very funny movie and also it is a movie that you would watch more than once.,1399248000,,132,3.75
5115622,5,B00803PFXG,"""Mr. Destiny"" is a movie that you'll never see on TBS or FX and it's one of my favorites.  It's sort of a modern-day ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but with the wry comedy that James Belushi and Jon Lovitz can deliver.  I still haven't seen ""Taking Care of Business"" or ""Hello Again"", but maybe some day.  ..... Naaaa, I'll just watch ""Mr. Destiny"" again.",1398470400,,349,4.421875
5115623,4,B00803PFXG,"You couldn't ask for better situation comedy ""Taking care of Business"" is a hoot.
Mr Destiny is a fine almost sci-fi love comedy story almost a time travel story.
This is an enjoyable story of a wife who died and through witchcraft was brought back to life a year later which created many problems for the husband.
All three movies on this disc is worth buying. They are a hoot...",1396656000,,380,4.442857142857143
5115624,4,B00803PFXG,"Mr. Destiny and Taking Care of Business are certainly not destined for classic status.  Of course, who would be expecting that?  Instead, they are great light fun and vehicles for Belushi to play his shtick.  Basically, some excellent escapist fare from the pains of reality.  Taking Care of Business is the better of the two, in my opinion, with a fine performance from Charles Grodin who really helps make the film.

I haven't watched Hello Again.",1388707200,,449,4.855263157894737
5115625,5,B00803PFXG,works fantastic thanks,1388534400,,22,6.666666666666667
5115626,1,B00803PFXG,I was excited to get this because I love Mr. Destiny but was disappointed when I received it and heard a rattling inside.  The movie was not secure in its place and was completely scratched.  Wish I could return it and get one that worked.,1387238400,2,239,4.288888888888889
5115627,5,B00803PFXG,Wanted this for 2 of the 3 older movies. Nice to be able to see after many years. Funny and lighthearted.,1383264000,3,105,4.0476190476190474
5115628,4,B00803PFXG,"I love these movies, they're very entertaining, the only thing I hate is the language in them, but I guess if I'm going to watch them I have to overlook that.  Funny Funny movies though",1382572800,,185,4.285714285714286
5115629,5,B00803PFXG,I love Mr. Destiny it is a classic movie!!! A must see! It makes you appreciate how your life turned out. :),1382054400,,108,3.9545454545454546
5115630,4,B00803PFXG,"Taking care of Business is the one I wanted most of all, since this was the only way I could get it, it's why I bought this. I have never seen either one of the other two movies. I will watch eventually. I like the idea of the prison break in Taking Care of Business, with a funny twist.",1381881600,,287,3.8813559322033897
5115631,5,B00803PFXG,SOOOOOO WORTH BUYING I LOVED EACH ONE OF THESE MOVIES WORTH WATCHING GREAT CAST IN EACH MOVIE SO I DO RECOMMEND IT,1380844800,3,114,4.2272727272727275
5115632,5,B00803PFXG,I bought this for the movie Mr. Destiny but the other 2 movies are also good.  In Mr. Destiny Larry played by James Belushi gets to see how his life would have turned out if one incident in his past 20 years ago had turned out different.  Isnt this something we all had wished for at one time or another.  Just remember the old saying be careful what you wish for.,1380067200,5,364,4.098591549295775
5115633,5,B00803PFXG,"I could not believe when I search for Hello Again on DVD it came with two fantastic bonus movies.

you;ll love this triple feature,...funny...funny...funny!",1379894400,4,296,5.061224489795919

5115635,5,B00803PFXG,"it is great to get a movie let alone 3 in one dvd.  All three are fun movies to watch and enjoy.  Very different but all enjoyable.  Won't go into detail so as not to give away the movie,  Mr Destiny is about what a man wishes for and what happens if he got it, Hello Again is about a lady who dies and her sister brings her back, strange concept in this one.  Taking Care of Business is about a prison escape so the man can go see the cubs play in the world series and his finding of book with everything in it a man needs to make his life easy.  Enjoy.",1379721600,2,554,3.8157894736842106

5115637,4,B00803PFXG,"I lucked out and got three for one.  I wanted Hello Again and got Mr. Destiny also. Have yet to see Taking care of Business, but think that James Belushi is a good actor and has a background in comedy that stands the test of time. Shelly Long ---  what to say about her except she has always delivered a fine performance in what ever film she is in.  I love her speech patterns when she is delivering the punch lines.  Can not miss with this trio.",1378080000,5,447,4.103448275862069

5115639,5,B00803PFXG,"I got this dvd for "" Hello Again"" which I had seen  on TV, but all 3 movies are fun to watch. I would recomend them for all ages, You won't be disapointed. ""Taking Care of Business"" and ""Mr. Destiny"" have lessons for us all.",1375920000,,224,3.977777777777778
5115640,3,B00803PFXG,I have only watched one of these movies so far and that is why I haven't given this a higher rating. After I finish the other two I will edit this review.,1373932800,,154,3.84375

5115644,5,B00803PFXG,"This DVD of three movies is great.  It has lots of fun and laughs.  The old fashioned kind where things were really funny, and not crass and disgusting.  This is a clean DVD with lots of hugs and good evenings ahead.",1365465600,,216,4.219512195121951

5115646,5,B00803PFXG,"This is a great trio of comedies from the Disney-folk (Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures, etc.). All have been severely underrated imho. My wife agrees w/ me...these should be given another viewing/reviewing and it's good to see them get a second chance for a fun, wacky and zany time to be had by all who choose to view them.",1363305600,,323,4.684210526315789

Hello Again was not funny, that movie was boring and stunk. The other 2 were good.",1358640000,,107,4.142857142857143
5115650,4,B00803PFXG,"I had read conflicting reviews on this title as far as the aspect ratio. I HATE MOVIES THAT HAVE BEEN REFORMATTED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE CHANGED TO ""FULL SCREEN"" WHICH IS 1.33. Since the present and future of HD TVs is 16x9, it would be stupid for any company to release reformatted movies in full screen. I was suspicious of the amazon listing because it lists the triple feature from millcreek as being released in 2012. I went to the millcreek web site and finally found that they list the official aspect ratios as 1.85:1, not 1.33 as amazon lists. I am attaching a link to a pdf on their web site if you care to judge for yourself.  This is enough for me to take a chance on this.

5115654,4,B00803PFXG,"I'm not sure if you could call this ""Triple Feature"" a Jim Belushi Retrospective or not, but there are several well-known actors and actresses in these films that make them enjoyable, even if the plots are a little thin. Mr. Destiny is my favorite because of the ""fate thing"" and the ""what-if"" scenarios going on. With name actors/actresses like Michael Caine, Rene Russo, and Linda Hamilton, you can't go wrong. And the classic cars! It was a fun film.",1356652800,,453,4.746835443037975
