8550153,5,B00ADRYH18,"This movie was great, family unity a father leaves his wife and child and comes  back years later because of a medical problem
 it caused a lot of pain,But the family forgave him  and was willing  after a while to sit down and listen before it was too late.
Robert  Mitchum  with his son and grand son it was so good .",1411948800,,318,4.048387096774194
8550154,5,B00ADRYH18,"My favorite actor! Saw this on TV back in '85 or '86, and I think this prompted ""A Family for Joe"", that came along about 5 years later. Lasted only about 5 series--which I was able to find on DVD! Sweet and funny!! So many great roles past him by. What he might have done in today's movies! ""Promises"" has good acting, including Tess Harper, and Mitchum's son and grandson. He's been away from his family for 30 years and then shows up. That's all I'm giving.....",1393027200,4,464,4.344827586206897

I feel this movie made the story line interesting and showed a way to overcome old bad feelings.
An excellent job done by the Mitchum family..... regards Movie Junky",1373328000,,268,4.8478260869565215
