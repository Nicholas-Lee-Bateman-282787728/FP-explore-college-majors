8120395,3,B000FBFYU0,"This was produced in typical Biography style, covers much of his early life and his rise into buisiness.  There is quite a bit of coverage of his early defence of the first amendment (Well someone had to do it).  This is a man who single handedly took down several members of congress and exposed hipocracy - not because of a political agenda, just because he was tired government corruption.  This is a far more interesting person than most people are aware.  I have often referred to Larry Flint as the last honest man in America.

Since this was origonally made in 1997, about the time of filming ""The People vs. Larry Flint"" there are several important events that have taken place since then related to Flint's life.  This does go into some of his political impact, but for a much more in depth look into his later life and political power have a look at ""The Right To Be Left Alone"".",1286755200,2,889,4.490683229813665
8120396,3,B000FBFYU0,"This documentary fleshes out and substantiates matters portrayed in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt.""

The documentary tries hard to be even-handed.  Hugh Hefner is seen along with anti-porn feminists like Steinem and the late Andrea Dworkin.  Usually A&E show spouses and children because parents are dead by the time their children become famous.  However, this  work interviews Flynt's father and daughters.

Flynt faced sexual molestation, false criminal accusations, as well as maiming.  Whether one is for or against pornography, one can sympathize with some of the ways that he has suffered.  I love that class is brought up in this American work when many citizens (falsely) assert that ""We're all middle-class.""

I never realized it until this, but Flynt is a redhead.  (Move over, Conan O'Brien and Carrot Top!)  While his disability is covered, the work never explains why Flynt has slurred speech.  I do not find Woody Harrelson sexy (though in ""Play It to the Bone"" he showed he had a firm, bubblicious booty) but he looked appealing wearing the American flag as Speedos.  However, seeing the real Larry Flynt wear the flag like a diaper was not erotic in the least.  (Prepared to be horrified!)

The documentary mentioned Flynt's late wife Althea.  Given the increased attention to bisexual women and HIV-positive women in the media, I really hope someone writes a biography of her or that Biography makes a work dedicated mostly to her life.",1156896000,2,1452,5.063291139240507
