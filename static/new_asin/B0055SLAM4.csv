8458627,5,B0055SLAM4,"A simple yet beautiful voyeuristic glimpse into 1970's Paris neighborhood of famed director Agnes Varda (The Beaches of Agnes / Cleo from 5 to 7 / The Gleaners and I / Vagabond). Truly intriguing and engaging.
I had seen the movie a couple of times before buying the DVD, and was so pleased by the bonus features:  Including several insider shorts on making and music and best of all a 21 minute return visit to the Rue Daguerre in 2005.",1432425600,4,437,4.4625
