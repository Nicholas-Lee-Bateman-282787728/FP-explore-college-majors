4990441,2,B006HH61Y4,"Released in 1970, ""Bigfoot"" was one of the first quasi-horror films devoted to the legendary beast-man, if not THE first. It relays the story of a couple of girls kidnapped by some bigfoot creatures and the mixed posse of country police & bikers who seek to find them.

Unfortunately, this is Grade C filmmaking all the way. For instance, the opening credits don't appear until almost the 10-minute mark. Most the scenes leading up to this are overlong time-wasters, like Joi Lansing walking up to her small plane and entering. Totally pointless! I guess they had to pad this turkey somehow, which is only 83 minutes long as it is. Also, most of the ""acting"" is laughable, and I mean that literally.

For me, the film's worthwhile for three reasons only: (1.) The gorgeous Judy Jordan in a bikini, mostly tied up to a tree (also check her out in 1973's underrated Western ""The Gatling Gun""); (2.) the cool hippie-era score; and (3.) the nostalgic badness of it all, which is sort of entertaining.

The movie was shot at Big Bear Lake and San Bernardino National Forest.

4990442,5,B006HH61Y4,I gave it a top rating because my wife and I really loved it. We felt it was defiantly worth the money. If your a Big Foot fan? Than I'm sure you'll love it too.,1375833600,,161,3.6285714285714286
4990443,5,B006HH61Y4,"To think, I've been wasting my life away, while cinematic masterworks like this have been out there! BIG FOOT is one of those rare film experiences, where every aspect lines up to perfection. As Jasper Hawkes, Sir John Carradine shows us, once again, why he is indeed a national treasure. The title creatures themselves are so well-realized, that tears streamed down my beaming face as I watched, agog! As they gathered their bikini-clad love-slaves, I could only weep w/ unbridled joy! The soundtrack, jumping flawlessly between banjos, voodoo bongos, and elevator rock, is sublime! All this, and outlaw bikers on trail-bikes too! Yes, BIG FOOT captures all that is great in film...",1364169600,3,683,5.107142857142857
4990444,3,B006HH61Y4,It was ok for a 1970s movie.  the people could be more realistic in their acting. but all in all good.,1354060800,,102,3.857142857142857
4990445,1,B006HH61Y4,Avoid this atrocity at all costs!!! This is just a VHS to DVD-R bootleg! I have been hoping someone like Code Red or Scorpian Releasing to release a legit pressed & authored DVD with Extras!,1343433600,9,190,4.457142857142857
4990446,3,B006HH61Y4,"""BIGFOOT"" ... Breeds with anything. Unfortunately, as it is with most ad campaigns, this film does not live up to the promise of the poster. There are only the slightest hints at BIGFOOT/human lovemaking. For those of us who are fans of the Sexual Sasquatch, this is only a tease. Let's see a picture with horny bigfoot who knows how to close a deal!  Also, there are way too many Mitchums in this for my taste.",1330905600,5,411,4.407894736842105
4990447,3,B006HH61Y4,"So I watched Bigfoot last night and to be honest... at times I was entertained (as in laughing), and then there were times I was totally zoned out from watching lmao!! Those ""bigfoots"" (yes, more than one), look awful lol!! And sometimes the people on screen look taller (including the captured women), look taller than these pathetic bigfoots lol! Still, i'm glad I bought it... the cover art does rock but sadly the transfer is horrible, well...bad vhs horrible but the movie does mostly take place in the daytime... but sometimes you wish the bigfoots weren't seen so much because of it lol! Also comes in full screen only. It's up to you haha. Makes for a nice conversation piece, plus, the word 'college' is spelled wrong when reading the summary on the back of the dvd lmao!! They spelled it 'collage' lol!

If you're a die-hard fan when it comes to ol' 70's Bigfoot films, than you might enjoy this one BUT this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel of Bigfoot/Sasquatch films.  Still, i found this more entertaining than some of the recent Bigfoot films that have come out in the past few years.  The only newest one I've seen and enjoyed, would be 'Abominable' made a few years back haha.  There really needs to be a good scary Bigfoot film made nowadays, seriously...",1330732800,12,1280,4.6255506607929515

8498537,3,B006HH61Y4,"Oh my.........not at all what I was expecting.  This movie is one big disorganized mess.  There are far too many characters doing far too little.  Endless yapping, not much in the way of excitement, and people inside fuzzy suits wearing Halloween masks running around trying to look like big foot and not people inside fuzzy suits.  Speaking of suits, two of the characters are wearing suits and ties as they run around the woods trying to catch big foot before he catches them and ties them to a couple of posts!!!  Besides being able to craft weapons and bury their own in nice tidy graves, these beasts can also tie knots........with clawed hands.  At one point, they end up with quite a few people tied to posts and guarded by their `baby.'  The men don't know what they're going to do to them.........as for the women (gasp) they have other plans.

This goes well beyond awful; this is whatever is left after scraping the bottom of the barrel.

As for the quality of the transfer, it's made apparent during the opening credits that something is off, names are chopped, there's a strange `shimmer' effect seen around objects.  The distortion is quite noticeable.  (I don't know that a pristine presentation would have helped matters much.  It's still an odd movie.  More horrid than horror.)

I'm keeping it anyway (if only for John Carradine's performance, which I liked).",1428278400,,1377,4.779661016949152
