5773475,3,B00D446G0W,"I am a big fan of Bollywood movies generally, but I didn't really come away from this one with a good feeling.  It was a little dark.",1386460800,,133,3.925925925925926
5773476,2,B00D446G0W,"So why the two stars, then? Because Ms. Kapoor is just about the ONLY good thing in a movie that follows every single beat of A STAR IS BORN, with hardly a variation from the innumerable Hollywood versions. Worse, her co-star Aditya Roy Kapoor's performance as the (musical) star she loves, even as his career fades and hers rises, isn't remotely in her league - while he's perfectly good when the script calls on him to be loving and supportive, he never convinces you for a second that he's a self-destructive artist who can't pull himself out of his career and life spiral. (I don't think I've seen a LESS believable drunk this side of a parochial school play!) That wouldn't be such a problem if this movie wasn't really a two-person show - with only one person doing all the heavy lifting!

Can somebody get this woman a motion picture worthy of her considerable talent? I've seen her in two films - this and TEEN PATTI - and she's been the best part of otherwise poor movies in both cases.",1383609600,,995,4.497237569060774
5773477,3,B00D446G0W,"Before I say anything about this film, I would like to mention that T-series products should not be purchased because they have too advertisements during the movie and we are forced to see their trailers before the menu comes.  I paid money for this movie, therefore, I should not be obligated to waste my time watching the damn commercials as well as ringtone advertisement or their stupid t-series logo in the upper right corner while enjoying a movie.
Now, about the movie, I loved the ending but it is not a movie or a story you will remember after a month.  It doesn't touch your heart.  The songs are not as good as the first Aashiqui.  Only three good songs and that too in the movie you don't get to hear them completely without interruption.",1379203200,6,750,4.533333333333333
5773478,4,B00D446G0W,Songs are very beautiful. And the most reason why I like this movie is less dansing scene unlike other Indian Cinemas. Also I think the situation is very real.,1375401600,2,159,4.517241379310345
5773479,4,B00D446G0W,"I started watching Bollywood movies in 2006.  I would only go back as far as 2004 because any movies before that were way too high on the cheese and over acting factor for me. As a result, my favorite actors and actresses are from that time- Saif Ali Kahn, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukerjee(?), Abhishek Bachan, Aiswarya Rai Bachan.  I quickly learned that the film industry in India has a ridiculously fast turnover.  It has only been 7 years and I really don't see any of those people on film any more.  Where did they all go?  Now I have to get used to a whole new bunch of young pretties.  The two main characters in this movie are new to me.  I have never seen them before.  However, they have done a really good job.  The story is about a handsome young singer named Rahul.  I don't know who does the actual singing in the movie but the songs are really good.  There are none of the traditional drawn out song and dance numbers but there is singing and it's great.  Anyway, Rahul is a super star but he is a serious alcoholic.  It has begun to affect his work.  By chance he meets Aarohi who is a bar singer.  She has a great voice.  Rahul sees himself on the decline and decides to occupy himself by sponsoring Aarohi and helping her become a singing success.  The chemistry between the two is very good.  There is no over acting, thank goodness.  I liked the progression of the story.  I was completely surprised by the ending because I have never seen that happen between the happy couple in a Bollywood movie.  It was surprisingly well done.  I feel like there's more to be told of the story.  I wonder if there will be a continuation.  I recommend this.",1373328000,14,1658,4.3257328990228014

5773481,4,B00D446G0W,"The Blu Ray arrived (seller was Planet Bollywood) on time and was original print in brand new sealed box. Flawless! Beautiful colors, sound and glamor typical of Bollywood of late.

 The movie is about a young singer Rahul whose once extremely successful career as a recording artist is now coming to an abrupt end because he has lost his passion for life, his art and most importantly his professional commitments because of raging alcoholism. He fritters around and finds himself in trouble even when he doesn't want to. Arohi is a simple girl with an angel's voice who once dreamed about becoming a playback singer but now has all but given up after struggling for a long time. She now sings at a shabby bar and struggles to make ends meet. One of Rahul's everyday troubles lands him in Arohi's bar. He is deeply impressed with Arohi's singing (Sun Raha Hai Na Tum in Shreya Ghoshal's voice, you will be impressed too!) and immediately develops an infatuation for her. Rahul offers Arohi to introduce her to some of his very high profile contacts in the recording industry. Arohi trusts him and quits her job. After some rocky start and hardship for Arohi that makes her doubt Rahul's trustworthiness, he does introduce her to the recording industry and her career takes off...

 Rahul's infatuation for Arohi and Arohi's grateful appreciation for Rahul slowly turns into an intensely deep and selfless love story.  Rahul wants to live again and sincerely tries to quit drinking and win his career back but struggles at both. As Rahul begins to realize his own limitations, he slips deeper into depression and tries to hold himself back from the woman he is intensely in love with, for he believes he could be a limiting factor for Arohi's now successful career. The depth of Arohi's love is very well captured in a scene where she consoles a tantrum throwing Rahul after he yells at her, pushes her out the door, and slams it behind her. With teary eyes and breaking voice but with a firm and loving tone, she consoles him and tries to lift his spirits in a way that shows the depth of her care for him and her understanding of his issues. Amazingly scripted, directed and acted out by both. Arohi begins to miss her recording studio schedules in her insistence of looking after a now unpredictable Rahul. Rahul fears that just like alcohol became the weakness that destroyed him, he is becoming the weakness that would destroy Arohi's career. He wants Arohi to be what he couldn't and would do anything to help her get there. This adds layers of complexity to their relationship.... I won't spoil it for you by telling you where all this leads them, but the end is definitely unexpected and worth waiting the 132 minutes for! If you are expecting a typical singing and dancing Bollywood fare where everyone is happy and prancing around, or wants fun for the kids, this may not be that movie.

 The songs, just like the original Aashiqui of 1990, are amazing and Shreya Ghoshal brings even the classically inclined songs amazingly to life!

 Not giving 5 stars because of the loose scenes that keep popping up annoyingly. The two leads act pretty good, but I think their talent was not utilized well here, even with the very conducive plot. Some scenes and dialogues could have been subtler. But overall a definitely recommended watch!",1372377600,4,3339,4.743103448275862
5773482,3,B00D446G0W,Excellent video and audio quality on my bluray disc. I very much enjoyed the music but the story is very depressing.,1484438400,,116,4.571428571428571

5773484,3,B00D446G0W,Lead actor was good and showed enough depth through the movie arc of story but I felt the actress seemed more like a model posing through intense scenes. She did not seem natural when crying etc but was very beautiful to just look at. The music is the best thing in this movie - the singing and the love songs with their poignant heartfelt lyrics. I also think this movie underscores the destructive spirals of alcoholism and how it has impact on the widest rings of people who surround the person with the addiction.,1475107200,,517,4.51063829787234

5773489,5,B00D446G0W,"The film opens by showing a large crowd waiting for Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapoor)  a successful musician whose career is waning because of his alcohol addiction  to perform at a stage show in Goa. After nearly completing a song, he is unexpectedly interrupted by Aryan (Salil Acharya), who was losing his career due to Rahul's, during his performance. Rahul fights him, stops his performance, and drives to a local bar. He meets Aarohi (Shraddha Kapoor), a bar singer who idolizes Rahul. After noticing Aarohi looking at a photograph of Lata Mangeshkar in the bar, he assumes that she wants to become a singer. Impressed by her simplicity and voice, Rahul promises to transform her into a singing sensation, and asks her to never perform again in bars. Aarohi leaves her job and returns to Mumbai with Rahul, who convinces record producer Saigal (Mahesh Thakur) to meet her. When Aarohi calls Rahul, he is attacked and injured by some thugs, and is unable to receive her call. His friend and manager Vivek (Shaad Randhawa) says that news of Rahul's accident should not be leaked to the media, and instead publicises a false story that Rahul has left the country to participate in stage shows. When Aarohi attempts to contact Rahul again, Vivek ignores the calls. After two months of futilely attempting to contact Rahul, a broken Aarohi is forced to sing in bars again because of her family problems.

After recovering from his injuries, Rahul vows to search for Aarohi. He learns that Aarohi is working in a bar again and that Vivek had ignored her calls without informing him. Rahul apologises to Aarohi and fires Vivek, and they meet with Saigal for the recording agreement. Rahul begins to train Aarohi, who signs a music contract to sing in films and becomes a successful playback singer. Her family and Rahul are happy, but when people begin to gossip that Rahul is using her as a servant, he relapses into alcohol addiction. Aarohi, who loves Rahul more than her career, comforts him and they spend the night together. Despite Aarohi's mother's disapproval, Aarohi moves in with Rahul and things go well until Rahul's addiction worsens, causing him to become aggressive and violent.

To help Rahul fight his alcoholism, Aarohi attempts to rehabilitate Rahul, sacrificing her singing career in doing so. After Saigal reminds them about their dream of Aarohi becoming a successful singer, Rahul orders her to focus on her work. During Aarohi's stage show, Rahul meets a journalist backstage, who accuses him of using Aarohi for pleasure and money. Furious, Rahul beats up the journalist and starts drinking. He ends up in jail, and Aarohi comes to bail him out. Rahul overhears Aarohi telling Saigal that she is going to leave her career for him and is ready to give up her celebrity status because Rahul is more important to her. Rahul understands that he has become a burden in her life, and that leaving her is his only option to save her. The next day, he bids her farewell by assuring her that he will change his lifestyle and commits suicide by jumping from a bridge.

Distraught by Rahul's death, Aarohi decides to leave her career but Vivek persuades her to stay. He reminds her that Rahul wanted her to become a successful singer and killed himself as he did not want to be a burden on her and remain an obstacle in the path of her success. Aarohi agrees, and returns to singing. Later, she signs her name as ""Aarohi Rahul Jaykar"" in a fan's handbook as a tribute to Rahul and her unsung desire to marry him. As rain starts falling, she watches the couple who took her autograph sharing a romantic moment under a jacket as she and Rahul had done when he was alive.",1467590400,,3681,4.754303599374022

5773526,5,B00D446G0W,I am in love with this movie! The music fills me with the haunting beauty of longing to hold something that you will only barely manage to briefly touch with your fingertips. It touches on two very under-talked about issues in our society: Alcoholism and Mental Illness. The bitter sweetness of this romantic tale is the biggest appeal. Watching the character slowly lose himself within draws those viewing the film into a downward spiral of desperation.
