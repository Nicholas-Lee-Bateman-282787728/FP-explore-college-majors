3555169,3,B001EI5CHS,This video has way too many breaks in it. All of the information is broken down into too many small bite size pieces.  I hope the team at Dance Crazy will redo this with an updated product and not have so many 'cuts' to each segment.,1351555200,,233,4.065217391304348
3555170,5,B001EI5CHS,"With this video, yes you can.  Very easy to follow with instructions that are visually reinforced.  Even a guy with two left feet, like me, can learn to be the dance king.  I taught my wife a few simple steps and we became the hit of the wedding party as we foxtrotted and waltzed all over the floor.  Comments I got were, ""Where did you learn to dance like that?"" and ""I didn't know you could dance like that!"".

One hint, though:  Get this video early - don't wait until the week before your wedding like I did.  You need at least a month of practice for all of the steps to become easy.  If you apply yourself just a half hour each night, you can really get the basics down pat.

Enjoy.  Make Fred and Ginger envious.",1313107200,5,720,4.1521739130434785
3555171,5,B001EI5CHS,"I bought this dvd package because I wanted to learn how to dance for my wedding. I've never been that comfortable dancing free-form, so I thought learning a structured dance would be best for me. These videos definitely show you everything and explain all the dance moves in a well organized way. The instructors gave lots of details and moved at an easy pace so it wasn't difficult to get all the steps straight. Using these videos was so helpful and I'm glad I did it. When I was looking for wedding videos I discovered that this is actually the trimmed down version of the bigger 5 DVD pack, and it's much cheaper, so you really can't beat it. It's got great moves, it's a low price, and it actually teaches you how to dance. Well worth it.",1220832000,20,743,4.391304347826087

I received this product a discounted price, in exchange for my honest review.",1470441600,,174,4.612903225806452
8298300,5,B001EI5CHS,"I purchased this set along with several others from DanceCrazy. In this set of 2 DVD's, they teach you all the basics of the Waltz, Foxtrot, Swing, and Rumba. The focus is on dancing at weddings - so this would be a perfect gift for engaged couples. It would also be helpful for anyone that feels a little awkward in social events that involve dancing. It starts from the beginning skill level and builds. I found it entertaining throughout and fun to learn. They present it well, with visual examples and detailed instruction in the four-hour course. Would recommend! I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.",1437609600,,701,4.754098360655738
8298301,5,B001EI5CHS,Outstand DVD. I can't wait to go to the wedding in a few months and show off my new moves. This is a great purchase for anyone looking to improve thier skills. The package was well packed and the build quality was great. The item description was spot on. Thanks,1437350400,,261,4.24
8298302,5,B001EI5CHS,"This is a perfect classic wedding dance DVD set to have!
We purchased this set in a promotion for testing and review.

8298303,5,B001EI5CHS,"My husband & I took ballroom / social dance lessons for a while, but then the teachers moved out of town. After attending a family wedding recently, I realized I really wanted to brush up on what we knew, and add a few more steps.  I purchased the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Dance-Mastery-System-5-DVD-Set-A-Complete-Instructional-Step-By-Step-Guide-to-Dancing-at-Your-Wedding/dp/B000P2XNKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Dance Mastery System, 5 DVD Set: A Complete Instructional Step By Step Guide to Dancing at Your Wedding</a>&nbsp;and this set as well.  This set is a subset of the other set, so if you want to learn more dances, and more steps, I suggest the other set.  If you just want to survive the wedding dance & look good, this set should do it.

They teach you  less steps for each dance(check my review for the steps included in the more complete system), but still teaches you the basics of the dances.  The dance sequences are left out, as is the tips section that appears on some of the other disks on the mastery system.  I prefer the more complete system, but this is cheaper and will get you through the dance.  The Mastery system will keep you dancing after the wedding is long over. I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review based on my actual use of this product. After using it, I will tell you, IT WORKS, and this is a bargain compared to the dance lessons we took. It's less than signing one of us up for the community classes. It would be a great gift for a bride to be (or groom to be), but it's great for anyone who wants to learn to dance.  Please let me know if this review was helpful. I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product, and I try to answer any questions left in comments.",1436227200,3,2963,5.316916488222698
8298304,5,B001EI5CHS,"My wife and I do not dance. Along comes the opportunity to try a product at a discount that can walk us through the steps, literally. This is incredible for the price! Everything is well explained and we did not feel rushed through it or anything. It was step-by-step and very helpful for us. Although we are not going out and doing the foxtrot in public yet, we are finding the steps and explanations easy to follow and are doing well so far even though we only had it for a short time. Given a couple of weeks, I am sure we would have at least three of the dances down well enough to be confident in public and look like we've been doing this for years. We are extremely happy and grateful we could get good lessons at a reasonable price because going to a dance school would be way too expensive.",1435449600,,799,4.228758169934641

8298306,3,B001EI5CHS,It is a good video tor learning to dance to older music.  Not good for learning to dance to more modern dance.,1373068800,,110,4.0
8298307,5,B001EI5CHS,"This DVD provided several hours of laughter while my daughter and her fianc, my daughter and I, and my wife and I learned some basic steps and prepared to dance at the daughter's wedding last May. Certainly none of us rivaled Fred and Ginger, but just the confidence of knowing _something_ about dance made all the difference in the world. DEFINITELY buy this if you've got an event coming up, and you want to do more that just sway back and forth on the dance floor.",1371254400,,467,4.441860465116279
8298308,4,B001EI5CHS,"The couple was very good and taught a lot of dance moves so when it comes to that, you really get your money's worth. I thought they talked a little much but that's just my opinion, some people might like that.",1360281600,,210,4.146341463414634
