3883815,5,B002ACKBTG,"I have waited and waited for mr. belevedere to come on DVD.  I enjoyed season 1 & 2, and couldn't wait to order season 3!  The 1st 2 or 3 episodes aren't that funny but the rest of the DVD are great!  Although it was only the 80's the fact that there are no cell phones or internet makes it seem like a simpler time! I'm in my fifties and a teenager watching mr. belevedere, probaly is like me watching I love lucy as a kid!  The relationship between Wesley & Mr. Belevedere is worth 10 times the price of the DVD!  They have good chemistry!  If you want my opion BUY IT!  Sadly I had to go to the shout factory to purchase season 4 because amazon didn't have it yet.",1272844800,,667,4.007575757575758
3883816,5,B002ACKBTG,"I do appreciate Shout! Factory taking otherwise forgotten TV and releasing it on dvd. Its a nice trip down nostalgia lane. But for some reason, retailers will not be carrying the remaining seasons (4-6) in stores. We are lucky though that Shout! Factory is releasing season 4 on their website this January for fans of the show that want to continue their collection. Great idea! I applaud them. Unlike other producers of DVD's who just stop after one or two seasons(Growing Pains, Who's the Boss), we finally get someone that has the customers in mind. And for those a fan of My Two Dads, they will also be doing the same thing. So I urge everyone to check out their website and purchase these items to encourage the continuation of this series and hopefully get other companies to follow in their footsteps that have otherwise given up on their product liceances.",1260403200,7,864,4.728476821192053
3883817,5,B002ACKBTG,"Unlike most television series today, Mr. Belvedere hearkens back to the family fun shows of yesteryear such as Andy Griffith, Gomer Pyle, etc.  The humor is as crisp today as it was then and leaves you with tears of laughter and joy.  This show tackled some tough subjects but ultimately, it was the love and laughter that shone through from the cast who got along off-camera to the witty script writing.

A must have for fans of 80's TV series!",1255651200,,445,4.5375
3883818,5,B002ACKBTG,Awesome beloved 80's comedy. Some of these shows I have not watch since the 80's. I loved the heartwarming trip down memory lane! Rest in peace Mr Belvedere.,1254441600,,157,4.642857142857143
3883819,5,B002ACKBTG,I always enjoyed this show when it was on tv and was thrilled when it was released on dvd.  I'm very anxious for the final seasons to be released!!,1253577600,,147,4.068965517241379
3883820,5,B002ACKBTG,"Shout Factory! serves up yet another serving of our favorite butler Mr Belvedere, with Mr Belvedere Season Three.  The eagerly awaited set doesn't disappoint.  The 22 episodes bring us yet another batch of laughter and tears in the Owens household, all with Mr Belvedere ending the day with his insightful and funny journal entries.

The episodes are all the original network episodes, all running over 23 minutes in length.  All the music featured in the episodes is included as well.  Shout! did a great job in ensuring that we get to see Mr Belvedere the way we remember him during his network run.  The episodes themselves look clear and vivid without any audio problems either.  The original opening and closing credits are included as well.  There were quite a few songs sang and played in the episodes and Shout! did great work in ensuring that they didn't get edited for this DVD.  The fans appreciate it!  Robert Goulet even guest stars and sings a few songs.  Other guest stars this season include Doris Roberts (Every Loves Raymond), Susan Anton, Dr Joyce Brothers, Bubba Smith and Tony Danza.

Season three continues to feature great episodes that don't feel dated even though this is an 80's sitcom.  Bonus features include commentary  on 6 episodes with cast emembers Ilene Graff, Rob Stone, Tracy Wells and Brice Beckham.  Unfortunatey Bob Uecker wasn't available but at least this time Tracy Wells was able to participate.  Besides, there's always next season.  The commentary tracks are fantastic, as you join the cast as they laugh and revisit Mr Belvedere.  They talk about the goings on on stage and back stage on the set, their memories of working on the show, how much of an impact the show had on the fans and even touch on an urban legend regarding Rob Stone.  You learn a lot from the commentaries and feel as though you are watching the show with the cast as they revisit Mr Belvedere.  The commentaries are on the following episodes:  Debut (aka Close Call, Kevin's Date, Pills, The Crush, The Competition and Kevin's Older Woman.

Any fan of Mr Belvedere is surely going to want this set.  The show continues to hold up well in its third season.  Even if you have never seen the show and don't have the first seasons you can still enjoy a great sitcom with clever dialogue, funny lines and some genuine moments of family problems (as Ilene Graff says all solved in half an hour of course).  Be sure to buy this set and we can hope Shout! Factory brings us season four in as quickly an amount of time as possible.  Thanks again Shout! for doing such a great job on such a great show!",1252713600,8,2610,4.656455142231947

3883834,4,B002ACKBTG,"I won't be redundant with this review and praise the Belvedere T.V. Series everybody knows and loves.  Enough has been written about that.  I purchased this DVD almost exclusively for the commentaries and extras (something that could not be found in the .AVI online torrents), and those items alone are worth the price of admission to me.  But, as a consumer, I feel I should warn potential buyers that when purchasing directly from amazon that the shipping estimates are all smoke and mirrors.  The item did arrive a day earlier than expected, which of course I was happy about, but I never received any text notifications as promised, and I upgraded to standard shipping after realizing amazon's offer of free ""Super Saver Shipping"" was a total bait and switch.  Hopefully we'll see season 5 of Belvedere from Shout Factory",1331078400,,825,4.906474820143885
3883835,4,B002ACKBTG,"I was pleased to get my copy of Mr. Belvedere season three in the timely manner that it said. In the product review it had mentioned that there was a scratch on the UPC bar, so I figured some wear and tear came from handling, no biggie. The review also mentioned it was still factory sealed. When I got my order I check for that mark on the UPC code and saw that it was deliberately scratched, with a very deep cut. I also saw that the wrapping had been put on by the individual itself, in order for that cut to have been there. Which meant that it wasn't factory sealed. I checked the set for any other damages but that was the only one, just like the produce review stated so no sense in returning it. Had no problems so far with the discs so it worked out fine.",1320883200,,764,4.066225165562914
3883836,5,B002ACKBTG,WHERE IS THE NEXT RELEASE for the 5th season?????  I want more! I WANT MORE! Mr. Belvy keeps you on your toes with his humorous wittiness.

3883837,5,B002ACKBTG,"Mr. Belvedere Season Three comes with 22 Episodes in 4 DVDs. I'm surprised and didn't know I was going to enjoy watching this Series as much as I do. Mr. Belvedere an English Butler so proper the way he moves about dealing with the Owens Family and their everyday problems and duties, even the Parents go to him for Advise, everyone listens to him, he has really taking over the House and this Family

I think is funny his interaction with the Smart Quick-Witted Youngest member of the Family, Wesley, and the way he tackles all the problems with the others two kids, I don't know how he does it? ...he always has all the meals ready and the House in order. Mr. Belvedere never gets upset or break a sweat,...I guess he was trained right! ...The Episodes are Fun to watch, it makes for Good Family Entertainment! ...Thank You D.D.",1309996800,,830,4.496688741721854

3883839,5,B002ACKBTG,"I have always loved this show.  Mr. Belvedere and Wesley were my fav characters.  They don't make shows like this anymore.  I really wish they did.

Thanks to Shout!
