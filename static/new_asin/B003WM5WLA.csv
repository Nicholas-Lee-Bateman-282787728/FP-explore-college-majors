4214205,3,B003WM5WLA,"""Dead Awake"" begins as a slow, meandering, bizarre, inexplicable story that shows us a lot and yet doesn't seem to be going anywhere. By the time we discover that the film is indeed about something, we've already passed the point at which we can still care about it. We then have to endure a twist ending that's not only painfully unoriginal, but is also deeply connected to a plot hole big enough to drive a truck through. I went through three distinct emotional stages watching this film. The first was intense dislike, for it seemed as if the film's sole purpose was to hopelessly confuse the audience. The second was a quiet, reserved sense of acceptance, and it came to me the moment I finally realized that the filmmakers were in fact aiming for something. The third was disappointment, since it was obvious that their aim was way off.

The film is a moody psychological drama that always looks muddy and out of focus. It continuously hints at the supernatural and yet never gets around to confirming or denying it until the very end, at which point all interest in the subject has passed. The main character is Dylan (Nick Stahl), an emotionally distant young man who still broods over a car accident from ten years ago. He visits the crash site every year on the anniversary of the crash, and as he explains to the detective who handled the case, something about the situation just doesn't add up. He's currently a funeral director, having given up on college and life in general. He often has trouble sleeping. He's on anxiety medications. He continuously plays with a yoyo, believing its ability to keep returning to his hand is symbolic of the mistakes that keep coming back to haunt him.

At the funeral of an old high school football acquaintance, he reunites with Natalie (Amy Smart), who was his high school sweetheart until the death of his parents. She's now the girlfriend of another high school classmate (Ben Marten), who likes to boast about his fledgling legal career and still regards Dylan as a lower life form. Despite this, it's obvious that Natalie and Dylan still have feelings for each other. And with this, we come to a bet that Dylan makes with friend and fellow funeral director, a grating Irish stereotype named Decko (Brian Lynner): If he were to fake his death and put his name in an obituary, absolutely no one would come to his funeral. The next thing we know, Dylan is lying in an open casket, waiting for someone - anyone - to show up. If there was ever an event that could only exist in the movies, this would be it.

Here enters Charlie (Rose McGowan), a full-fledged junkie. She's obsessed with death. She constantly reads the obituaries. She goes to wakes all the time. Her apartment is a nightmarish shrine of newspaper clippings and filth. At Dylan's phony wake, she rambles about the sentence, ""Jesus wept,"" which happens to be the Bible's shortest passage. For reasons never adequately explained, Dylan follows her to her apartment; through very unlikely circumstances, she becomes convinced that he's her guardian angel, that he's actually dead, and that his belief that he's still alive is merely a state of denial. She claims that the dead walk among us all the time, that Dylan is in purgatory. If he's dead, he asks her, then why is it that everyone else can see him? If you believe in it, Charlie explains, you will make it real for yourself and for others. To get out, you first have to accept that you're dead. Then you have to make peace with your life.

Where is all of this going? What message is director Omar Naim trying to send? For most of the film, I was convinced that there wouldn't be an answer to either of those questions. It builds itself up in the strangest of ways, none of which seem to connect to anything. What am I to make, for example, of an early moment when Dylan talks to a corpse in a coffin and then in an unexplained flash notices the corpse's mouth move? Is he communicating with the dead, or is he on too many medications? What about his dreams? Are they dreams at all, or are they fragmented premonitions of some sort? What about the quick flickers of light, or the sudden whispering of voices?

Although we eventually find out what the film is trying to say, much of what I just asked remains unanswered. So then why was any of it included? And then there's the ending, one that would be impossible considering all the various way it ties into important plot events. It also begs the question of whose story was really being told. I don't know who was hired to keep track of the film's continuity, but that person needs a serious crash course in the subject. And now that I've written this review, I find that I've reached a fourth emotional phase: Frustration. ""Dead Awake"" had all the right ingredients for a reliable fantasy drama, and yet they were mixed together in the wrong amounts. The result is a confused, overwrought, dingy-looking mess of a film. This may be nitpicking on my part, but I also think the title just terrible.",1291593600,18,5021,4.611856823266219

8407407,1,B003WM5WLA,"In my opinion, ""Dead Awake"" feels like a movie made by someone who doesn't like movies. There is nothing from the start to the finish of this ""film"" that is interesting.  It is hard to imagine that someone read this script and financed this movie.

I bought (yes, I bought) this film on blu-ray because I am a fan of both Amy Smart and Rose McGowan. I've watched quite a few films that feature each of these two ladies, and I have never failed to be entertained by their films.

Enter ""Dead Awake."" Confusing from the beginning, it never engaged me in any way. I didn't feel anything while watching this movie that even resembled suspense, wonder, happiness, sadness, or excitement. Maybe I felt slightly annoyed a few times, but that is about as strong of an emotion that I felt.

Nick Stahl's character was an unlikable ""Dylan Downer"" who has basically given up on life after his parents are killed in a car accident. Nothing he does makes any sense - especially the preposterous idea that he would fake his own funeral just to see if anyone would show up. Real people that suffer from depression would never consider anything so emotionally risky as this.

A down and out junkie Charlie (Rose McGowan) wanders in to his fake funeral (after the place is closed), and eventually has a conversation with Dylan's long lost love Natalie (Amy Smart) who also waits until the funeral is over to show up (yet, young Dylan continues to lie in his coffin.)  All this eventually leads to Dylan hanging out with Charlie, and rekindling his feelings for Natalie.

Natalie is engaged to a soon to be successful lawyer type who undoubtedly will give her wealth, but maybe not true love. When Dylan finds Charlie passed out in her bathroom from a drug overdose, he gets her to the hospital. Surprise! Her nurse turns out to be Natalie. So they start talking and...

Numerous coincidences link all of the main characters in a way that only a poorly written story can do. By the time it is over, I just didn't care what happened. I just wanted it to end.

Moving cameras, blurry images, hints of supernatural occurrences, poorly placed ""clues"", lame dialog, uninspired acting, and unmemorable locations all add up to 92 minutes of bad film making.

The music is stunningly terrible at times, as the editors attempt to squeeze a little emotion from these ill conceived scenes that appear on the screen.  It never works.  Instead, the music merely distracted me momentarily from the acting.  I actually laughed out loud twice when I became aware of the overbearing music.

Both Amy and Rose are much better than this material.  I'm not so sure about the top billed Nick Stahl, as I don't remember ever seeing him in anything before.  Amy Smart gives the best performance of the three leads, but it's just not enough to save such a poorly executed idea.

The blu-ray itself looks and sounds acceptable, but contains no special features (other than a few previews.)

So save your time and money. Sit this one out. But if you just have to see this film, I will be listing it on eBay in a few minutes.",1412640000,,3080,4.620183486238532
8407408,5,B003WM5WLA,I thought 'Dead Awake' was a totally cool film. Well acted... well directed... and great camera angles. ~Stefano Capone (IMDB),1393891200,,126,5.35
8407409,3,B003WM5WLA,"Underrated drama with a unique point of vieW. I've never seen Rose McGowan so touching. The plot is sometimes overcomplicated. But if you let yourself go, you might get lost in a very beautiful movie. I really enjoy the feeling of being slightly lost in a movie. Good suspense and nice twists.
Too bad the blu Ray is 'absolutely horrendous. The visual aspect is ugly (especially in the Dark scenes) and the sound mix is barely average). Which is a shame.",1388361600,,454,4.617283950617284
8407410,3,B003WM5WLA,I enjoyed this pretty good movie. But then I'm an Amy Smart fan. Thats why I bought the thing. Glad it was so cheap.,1378166400,,116,3.875
8407411,2,B003WM5WLA,"I thought this movie will be ok, but it wasn't. I like Nick Stahl in mirrors 2, and therefore thought this movie will be just as good. But it wasn't to me. It wasn't Nick Stahl; but it was who written it that did not do a good job of it.",1364169600,,237,3.6666666666666665
8407412,3,B003WM5WLA,"It takes some time to know what is going on and what this movie is really about.  The script lacks in that respect, and some of the photography is distractingly filtered. This does not take away from the performances, esp. by Nick Stahl and Rose McGowan, as an undertaker and a junkie who get mixed up in each other's lives.",1320624000,,324,4.4
8407413,5,B003WM5WLA,"I thought this movie was sad because of what happenec to Dylan's parents and the fact that ten years later he thinks that he doesn't have what he had in high school. He had Natalie he has her now,and he has Deco.",1312848000,,212,4.071428571428571
8407414,4,B003WM5WLA,"Ever wonder who would show up at your funeral?  After attending a funeral for an old high school friend and running in to his ex-girlfriend (Amy Smart) Dylan (Stahl) comes up with a plan to stage his own death and hold a funeral for himself.  When a strange crack addict (McGowan) shows up to see him his life takes a strange turn and nothing is what it seems.  This movie is hard to explain without giving anything away, but the best way I can put it is that it is a cross between the ""Sixth Sense"" and ""After. Life"".  I really enjoyed the movie and I'm not sure if it was because I had no expectations heading in or because it was actually a very good movie (if that makes sense).  This is more of a drama then horror, in the same way the ""Sixth Sense"" could be categorized either way.  I really liked the twist at the end, I honestly can predict about 95% of movies made lately and this one got me.  I was very surprised at how much I liked it.  I surprisingly give it a B+.

Would I watch it again? - I would, if only to catch clues I missed the first time.",1301356800,8,1061,4.0625
