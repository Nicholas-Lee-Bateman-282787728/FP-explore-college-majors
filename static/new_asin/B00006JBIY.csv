1779161,1,B00006JBIY,"Don't waste your money.  This is the most pathetic, up-hyped, piece of rubbish I have ever wasted my money on.  Pathetic story lines by a director who wishes to promote his artistry.
Joe - stick to your magnificent drawings - God forbid there might be a 'House of Morecock - The Twin Cocks' followed by 'House of Morecock - return of the Queen'.
I certainly got ripped off here - you wanna offer me a refund????????????????  Seriously.",1078963200,14,435,4.623376623376624
1779162,1,B00006JBIY,"When I first saw The House Of Morecock preview at thehouseofmorecock.com website, I was very excited about it, it seemed to be a very exciting animation, but now, I totally regret that I own it. The quality of this animation is really poor and cheap! The sound is even worse!
Although the storyline is acceptable, because all of us have our fantasies, it is not worth it to spend $30.00 with this DVD.
I got really disappointed because I was expecting something really cool, a better animation like you can see at Joe Phillips website, his official website has animation quality, but the DVD, please!! Really bad!!",1064966400,15,614,4.747663551401869
1779163,5,B00006JBIY,"This animated vid is a blast! (pun?) It's hip & hot & happy. Talk about safe sex. Watching this, that is. Jonas is the cool horny dude we gay or bi or curious straight guys want for a buddy. Watching this alone or with a j/o pal, you'll enjoy it. Mansex with a smile on its face. Cool.",1047513600,2,285,3.9310344827586206
1779164,5,B00006JBIY,I agree yeah the animation is not the best but come one people please it is a one of a kind and the first of its kind so let it go.  It is funny and raunchy and it made me hard a couple of times.  It you want something a little riske' and with humor and your fan of animation this movie is for you.,1042588800,5,298,3.5692307692307694
1779165,5,B00006JBIY,"The house of Morecock is the name of this video. It definitly lives up to that. I really liked it. It was fun, funny, and quite realistic. The animators didn't leave out any details. Everything you could imagine, is what these guys were doing. The characters were as if they were real live people, acting their lines. The sex scenes were realistically superb. Seeing is believing. I recommend this animated film.",1035936000,,412,4.816901408450704
1779166,5,B00006JBIY,I suppose I could say bad things but I just can't.  I've never seen gay cartoons that are this good! I first saw it at [...] and wanted it really bad.  Glad I bought it!  It's funny as heck!,1035849600,5,190,3.8205128205128207
1779167,1,B00006JBIY,"Flat, cheap animation combines with blah, unimaginative porn to produce this perfect blend of flat, cheap, blah, unimaginative animated porn.  The DVD's deceptively well-drawn cover illustration seems to be the only part of this release to which any sort of craft or care has been devoted.  Inside, there's a compendium of tired gay cliches, strung together in the form of a cartoon featuring low-budget Saturday-morning production values, and all of the subtlety of straight animated porn from the 1920s with none of the charm.  These delights are preceded by a three-minute commercial for Greenwood-Cooper calendars and other crap, during which such operations as fast-forward or menu or chapter skip (ie, LET ME OUT OF HERE) are ""not permitted at this time.""  I couldn't even find anyone to GIVE this DVD to.",1033171200,16,811,5.1679389312977095

7969906,5,B00006JBIY,"This is an entertaining erotic gay animated feature, containing 60 minutes of short adventures created and drawn by Joe Phillips. The stories tell of the adventures of one Jonas Morecock, a twentysomething blonde adventurer who travels around investigating monsters and mysteries, while having sex with every attractive young man he meets on the way - and sometimes with the monster, such as the ghost in episode 3, a merman in episode 8, and an angel and the devil in #8. There is no real horror with these monsters, and the sex is extremely graphic and unsafe, but the cartoon (as in film/TV animated cartoon) style makes it clean, amusing and entertaining, a bit like a grown-up gay Johnny Quest adventure. There are a few special features also, including an animated ""Behind the Toons"" biographical feature, and interview with Joe Phillips.

The story episodes are -
A Package for Jonas Morecock
Monster of the Lake
Ghostly Miner
The Chupacabra
Big Foot
Abduction
Gojiira
Moby Dick
Afterlife

The definition appears to be low-res, and I was watching it on my laptop, so I don't know how well it will look on a TV screen. I'm sure Joe Philips said in his interview that the original series was published on a web-site, so it may not be intended for the big screen.

7969907,2,B00006JBIY,"The animation for this video is just crappy. While the adventures that Morecock goes own are sexy, watching them in poor animation is a strain. Unless you are just a die hard fan of this series, I recommend you spend your money on something else.",1212364800,,246,4.488888888888889
7969908,1,B00006JBIY,"I am an animator, this is terrible. The images are bad, the animation is poor, the stories are ""not great""(I am watching my language), simply not something worth spending the money, I literally tossed into the trash in my recent spring cleaning. It got one star because ZERO star is not an aption, I would not give it even one star! I DON'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL!!!!",1149033600,5,364,4.447761194029851
