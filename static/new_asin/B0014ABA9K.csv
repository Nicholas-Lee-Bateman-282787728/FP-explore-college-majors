8254795,4,B0014ABA9K,"This movie's languid pace bothers some people, but it's actually hypnotic, truly CREEPY and one of the better cult thrillers of the early-80s. It's moody,  brooding, melancholy ... there is a neat twist at the end. It sort of reminds me of an X-Files-type mystery, but came 12 years before that hit show at least. If you want blood/guts/action: this ain't for you. If you're up for a thoughtful, dreamy psychological chiller: pick it up!",1251417600,5,437,4.826666666666667
8254796,1,B0014ABA9K,This is the worst movie of all time.  It's not campy.  It is just two hour of your life that you wish you could get back.  Avoid this dog at all costs.,1219190400,,151,3.65625
