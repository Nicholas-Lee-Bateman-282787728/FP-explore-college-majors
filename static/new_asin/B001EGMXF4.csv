8298011,3,B001EGMXF4,"The packaging looks nice, and yes, this is a region 1 release, and it is, but the video quality is not as good as I would have hoped. I am not sure if it is the compression used to fit the 13 episodes onto two discs, or some other problem, but the video is blurry in scenes and any camera pan movement has stepping, judder, or whatever you want to call it. It is consistent throughout all of the episodes and the judder is the same number of pauses. Hopefully a better quality release comes to us by another distributor.

Still, it is nice having it on DVD. I enjoy the show, even as an adult. I only remember the theme song and the cool cars, but I found the shows to be entertaining and the characters interesting. It's a ridiculous, yet fun concept that these teenage stunt drivers are secret agents of Pole Positon. Their cars talk and have a fix for just about everything. But that is what used to make cartoons so fun, seeing what kind of impossible situations would transpire, and what sort of crazy solutions they would come up with to get out of them. But if you don't need to see it right away, wait for a better DVD release.",1357689600,2,1135,4.25462962962963
8298012,3,B001EGMXF4,"Pole Position was created by DIC in 1984 and ran for 13 episodes. It had no back story in the pilot, but during each opening sequence during the theme song it is said that the original Pole Position team is somehow deceased, and there 3 kids are now in charge of Pole Position. A team of stunt drivers who fight crime with the aid of their cars and the super computers that run them. Tess (Lisa Lindgren))is the female lead who drives a read Mustang named Wheels, voiced by Melvin Franklin. And her brother Dan (David ""Captain Planet"" Coburn) drives around in Roadie, a blue more futuristic looking car (might be real, never seen one tho). Together with their little sister Daisy (Kaleena Kiff) and her pet .. cat? racoon? Animal of some sort named Kuma (Marilyn Schreffler) play a similar role to the story of Knight Rider where their uncle calls them via a video phone and assigns them missions to help people in need. The cars have super computers with minds of there own, and you pretty much get a cartoon version of Team Knight Rider where the cars have been described as something like Transformers, but reminds me more of M.A.S.K as they don't turn into robots, they just go from vehicles to being able to fly or ski on water with other little hidden gadgets inside to aid their journey.

Each episode is kind of like a Scooby Doo adventure, someone did something, or something has gone missing, and it's up to Shaggy, I mean Pole Position to arrive on the scene and solve the mystery/crime.

If you where a fan of M.A.S.K, Scooby Doo, Transformers or maybe even Knight Rider... you may enjoy this series. It is on two discs, contains all 13 episodes, and it reasonably prices. There are no bonus features what-so-ever. The quality is pretty good, it's been cleaned up, and the sound is as good as expected.

It's amazing seeing this show again for the first time in nearly 20 years, espcially since I only remembered one episode and one small 30 second scene, and the rest of the episode I had no memory of, but it stuck with me all these years enough for me to remember it and want to see it again. It's not a show I expected to get a DVD release, but here it is, all 13 episodes. It may not have been the greatest show of all time, but it was less annoying then alot of the old 80's show that had a small group of followers or one of those shows that just seemed better as a kid.

It's nothing spectacular, but it's a decent watch for those interested in it.",1327276800,7,2468,4.393873085339169
8298013,5,B001EGMXF4,"This set, albeit barebones, is a perfect presentation for a rare Dic effort from the early 80s.
This region 1 release from Exposure Entertainment seems to have fallen OOP. I recommend grabbing one if you love the cartoons of the era.",1303344000,6,233,4.7073170731707314
8298014,5,B001EGMXF4,"It's a bare bones set (no extras) But all the episodes are very good audio/visual quality. Perhaps if they release a ""special edition"" in the future they could include some extras like model sheets/specs of the cars. ;)",1243296000,6,219,4.7894736842105265
