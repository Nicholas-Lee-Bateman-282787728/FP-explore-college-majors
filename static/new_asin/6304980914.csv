7882983,4,6304980914,"This is a cute and fun movie with all the friends from Little Golden Book Land in it. There is Tootle the Train and Katy Caboose, with Shy Little Kitten and Scuffy the Tugboat. Plus Poky Puppy, Saggy Baggy Elephant, Tawny Scrawny Lion, and Baby Brown Bear to name most of them. There are cute songs and adventures as they work together trying to save Little Golden Book Land from a big storm that is coming. This short movie will be enjoyed by most of the family, from the very young child to the oldest parent. But the teenagers will claim they don't like it. We enjoy watching it often.",1397779200,,588,4.3545454545454545
7882984,5,6304980914,My grandson and I have watched this movie over and over and he never tires of it.  Love the story and the message it portrays.,1349827200,,126,4.04
7882985,5,6304980914,"Yes... I remember watching this movie when I was little. I just happened to be cleaning my room today and I decided to watch it. God, I loved it. I was so into trains. Anyway... Even at 16 I felt all warm and happy inside to watch this video. Tootle's the real hero no matter what you say. Sorry Scuffy :P.
Anyway, I think most children under 7 will enjoy this video. It's heartwarming and funny. Even though it is over 10 years old. I think it has to be one of my favorite cartoons ever. It's too bad it's less than a half hour long. But anyway. BUY IT!!!!",1054857600,2,557,4.072727272727272
7882986,5,6304980914,"My grandchildren (ages 2, 3, 4 & 5) love this video.  It has been replayed countless times and yet they are still entranced when they watch it.  They sing the songs, dance to the music, and cheer Scuffy on as he and his friends race the storm to save Golden Book land.",1017792000,4,268,4.134615384615385
