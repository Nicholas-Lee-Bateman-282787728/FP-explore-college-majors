7908326,5,B00000FDRT,"This is the first Amine I have ever seen, so I was skeptical at first. After watching the first boxed set series I couldn't wait to find the second. What I really love so far (I have not seen it all yet) is the portrayal of emotions. I highly recommend this for all!",1002758400,,266,4.037735849056604
7908327,4,B00000FDRT,"The three episodes on this tape were important to understanding the story but were not very exiting. Let me explain what I mean. The first episode had Miaka sick from too much stress. Hotohori decides the only thing to do is send her home to recover. So they need to travel to Taitskun's home on mount Taikyoku. On the journey there we find out that Nuriko is a man. Tamahome apologizes to Miaka for being so unfeeling before she collapsed. Then later Tamahome and Miaka have an arguement,and she runs off. She runs into a mirror world where a girl that looks exactly like her is smiling wickedly. The next has Miaka trapped in the mirror watching the other Miaka get really friendly with Hotohori, and tell tamahome and hotohori that nuriko is a man. Then she finds out that the other Miaka is a part of herself. So Miaka stabs herself to get rid of her. It works but now she is badly injured. They continue on once Miaka is revived and reach Taitskun's home.  Lastly they are greeted by Taitskun(she is an old hag) who commends Miaka for going that far to save her warriors. Then the Nyan Nyan( which ar cute little green haired girls) tend to their wounds. Miaka has lost a lot of blood and will need more,  for in order to return home she must be at full strength. Tamahome and Hotohori offer theirs and Taitskun oversee's the transfusion with her magic. Then Miaka returns home helped along by Yui. Once home Miaka tries to find Yui but has no sucess. The tape ends with Miaka calling Yui's house. Overall the episodes are important, but you don't want to watch them over and over. Some parts are fun, but are basically not very exciting. That is why I gave it a four instead of five.",978912000,2,1689,4.427652733118971
7908328,5,B00000FDRT,"Fushigi Yugi is the best anime I have ever watched! That's really saying  something about it, considering that I'm a huge fan of many other animes  too. It has everything you could ever want, action, adventure, humor,  romance, GREAT characters and character development. I'm not kidding, you  are cheating yourself out of a great time if you miss out on ANY Fushigi  Yugi vidoes OR manga! It's wonderfully entertaining, go watch it! Now I  say! (just kiddin', I can't force you to do anything, I just hope you WILL  watch it!) ^_^.",968112000,,532,4.717391304347826
7908329,5,B00000FDRT,"One of the most wonderful aniem series I've ever picked off the shelf. The storyline is so original, nothing is copied. When people Say ""El Hazard-meets The Never-Ending Story"" nuh-uh. It's it's own thing.  Kinda like Eva ain't no X-files! ^-* Keep in mind this isn't for kids. It  deals with rape and sex, nudity and violence, it isn't an innocent kids  cartoon. I'd recomend about 13-15 being the yongest age to watch it. To  watch this, clear your mind, and you'll like it. Close your mind, and  you'll hate it. If you try to put it on a level with Drago nBall Z, and  you're a boy, Fushigi Yuugi might be overlooked. Don't overlook the best  anime to hit american stores shelves. Watch this, and be hooked for an  eternity. Grow to love Miaka and Tamahome, and their love, and how some  nice people don't break them up no matter how much it's killing them  *Nuriko-chan!* and how some try to for their own selfish reasons. *Yui,  Nakago, Hotahori* BUY THIS <Fushigi Yuugi> NOW!",959299200,,981,4.548571428571429
7908330,5,B00000FDRT,"I had heard about Fushigi Yugi before, but I had never thought about it. One day I went to the store to buy a Sailor Moon Video and I thought I'd buy Fushgi Yugi, just to see what it was like. After I watched it I FOUND  OUT IT WAS AWSOME! At first it's a bit confusing, but it's really really  awsome after you understand it. I have only seen this tape, I haven't seen  the first one, but I love it anyways. I can't wait to get the next tape  it's so awsome ^_^",951264000,,462,3.831578947368421
7908331,5,B00000FDRT,"WHAT!  I am offended and shocked that anything FY related does not have 5 stars! Anything that has the words Fushigi Yuugi on it shoul be at the top. It is the best anime ever! Of course, I am a little biased, b/c it is my  fave series, but still! I have seen a ton of anime, and it is still my  favorite one.",945907200,,309,3.796875
7908332,5,B00000FDRT,The second FU video is well done (even though some of the voice acting is weak at parts) and a great mix of comedy and drama.  So far I have only seen the first two movies and I absolutly love this video.  I am a huge  anime fan so you can take my word for it.  This anime is one of the tops  and should be just as famous as Ranma 1/2.,935625600,2,335,3.5972222222222223
