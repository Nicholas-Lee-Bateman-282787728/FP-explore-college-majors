1350678,2,B00004TJSH,"I am amazed at the insipid depravity that passes for art these days. I rented these latter-day underground films expecting to encounter Kenneth Anger-ish weirdness, yet I was greeted with poorly directed, uninteresting and rather pretentious pornography. Kern is the first person I have encountered that can actually put me to sleep with his films about rape and murder.  I recommend this to anyone who would enjoy seeing Lydia Lunch disrobe every five seconds, anyone who wants to see..., anyone who is willing to sit through two hours of ""Film"" without encountering an original plot (where applicable) and anyone who is amused by shoddy acting and incompetent camera work.  I gave it two stars because ""You killed Me first"" was moderately amusing.",976147200,8,749,5.131147540983607
1350679,4,B00004TJSH,"This DVD is the collection of Kern's previous two videos with 3 additional shorts which weren't included on Hardcore Vol. 1 or 2. also there is a  photo gallery which doesn't include any new photos, only some from N.Y.  girls. any Kern fan should get this only for the 3 bonus films, nothing  else. the transfer is weak and the sound quality isn't that great but  considering that these shorts were shot on Super8 nothing could've been  done really. the films are still great and if you are not really familiar  with Kern's work they could be shocking. Lydia Lunch is in most of the  films and performs quite well. Henry Rollins in his Black Flag days makes  an appearance in Right Side of my Brain, which in my opinion is the best  film in this collection. Lydia's narration fits perfect with J.G.  Thirwell's music. Foetus, Coop Shot Cop, and Sonic Youth provide most of  the music. l'm surprised that M.Manson's ""Get your Gun"" video  wasn't included. one of his pictures is though in the gallery. overall this  is a dissent DVD. it might make some uncomfortable at times and l had some  of those moments myself. feminists should stay away from this one at any  cost.",965260800,8,1169,4.579710144927536

Yup, the seedy dank underbelly of life and the bits of it that fascinate us are showcased in grainy black & white, sort of like a deviant art school assignment meant to stir emotion, maybe even disturb you on purpose. Kern is genius in his expose of vignettes & documented visions we've all thought about & secretly wanted to see, but never had the guts to speak up about or for that matter ever knew existed in quite this manner. Kern brings a true NYC flare to his media visions & a hardcore punk/deviantly defiant edge to the already edgy-er side of alternative lifestyles. These short stories are fun too in a dark way and if you be a true voyeur, you'll be sucked in by his simplistic, yet stylized way of making films. This one has been in my personal collection since the 1990's when I first discovered it. I don't show it to anyone as I am certain common-folk won't appreciate it. I grew up on this scene though. If you love the music & feeling conveyed by such artists as Lydia Lunch, Pussygalore & Sonic Youth, this is right up your alley. Highly recommended for Charles Bukowski & William S. Burroughs fans too. Happy viewing!",1196812800,2,1292,5.070422535211268
1350693,1,B00004TJSH,"This is not avant-garde or artistic. It may be experimental, but to no productive end. Believe him when he calls it hardcore. Richard Kern takes advantage of the fact that Americans, in their schizo frenzy, will mistake this for something of social value when it was never intended as anything other than exploitation. I'm sure he had fun making these. I believe he also continues to have fun, photographing NYC girls.

I don't think that liking or disliking Kern's films should have any bearing whatsoever on one's opinion of ""the Cinema of Transgression"". He is not representative of the movement. The others are productive in their vulgarity; Kern is not. At any rate, I think it unlikely that the ""movement"" would even have a name, had it not come to fruition in the city of New York.

I think it is true that this is representative of the Lower East Side ""scene"". But it's a pretty disgusting scene, at this point really one of historical antiquity. It costs nearly $2,000 a month to rent a studio apartment in this neighborhood, and people are still moving there to dress up like Lydia Lunch. Does this sound punk rock to you???

It's a shame that Richard Kern has outlasted such superior filmmakers of the ""Cinema of Transgression"" as Nick Zedd and the Kuchar Brothers, and it is patently obvious that the reason for this is that Richard Kern is preoccupied with the most base and vacuous sexuality (heterosexuality), AND NOTHING ELSE.

1350696,4,B00004TJSH,Came on time and was good. Only thing is that the case was beat up a little in the mail but besides that good.,1120608000,2,110,3.625
1350697,4,B00004TJSH,"For those of you joining the party late, Richard Kern is a New York City based filmmaker/photographer who during the 1980's created a slew of short films that highbrow critics call ""cinema of transgression"" and everybody else calls ""some sick and twisted s***.""  By fusing the arthouse aesthetic of Godard with grindhouse horror meets porn, Kern created a look and language for the post-punk subculture that grew (festered?) in the Lower East Side at the time.  Appropriately, the soundtracks to his depraved fever dreams were often supplied by local underground acts such as Sonic Youth, Cop Shoot Cop, and especially Jim Thirlwell, a.k.a. Foetus.  His performers likewise were local art scenesters such as Lydia Lunch, Karen Finley and the late David Wojnarowicz (forgive my spelling if it's off).  For my money, though, his greatest star/diva/muse was the inimitable Lung Leg, whose drugged-out, nervous anti-acting virtually invented the ""waif look"" that models like Kate Moss would later water down for the mainstream.

The films in this collection assault the viewer with sex, violence, sex, and a general atmosphere of scuzz.  Did I mention sex?  Kern reveled in undressing his punk princesses and putting them in situations guaranteed to make doctinaire feminists howl in protest.  In ""The Evil Cameraman"" a very skinny young adult woman (who nevertheless looks about 13) is bound naked with ropes and tortured by Kern in the title roll.  It seems completely awful until you consider that the film depicts Kern as well, evil, a real scumbag.  You instead identify with the women and laugh when Kern gets his comeuppance.  Likewise, the phone-sex worker portrayed by Lydia Lunch in Kern's masterpiece ""Fingered"" is completely in control of the pathetic, depraved psychos who call her.  She even manages to menace poor hitchiker Lung Leg later on, and the latter's performance is something to behold.  Lung doesn't act so much as drift into her ""character"" like some incredibly strange ghost.  By any normal standards she's awful, but as you may guess these aren't exactly normal films.  Some, like ""Death Valley '69,"" are music videos that MTV wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole and a hazmat suit.  ""The Right Side of My Brain"" is a psychosexual monologue/rant starring Lydia Lunch during which we get to see way too much of Thirlwell and Black Flag's Henry Rollins.  The teeny-tiny ""Nazi"" is just a striptease by a woman who starts out dressed as a you-know-what.  It's contrived and brilliant at the same time.  ""You Killed Me First,"" starring Lung Leg as the rebellious teen from hell, with Finley and Wojnarowicz as equally hellish parents, doesn't hold up so well, despite Ms. Leg's weirdly atavistic ""performance.""  Here, contrivance overtakes brilliance by a mile; it's practically unwatchable.

Of course, 90% of human beings will find this entire package unwatchable.  These are extreme visions for extreme sensibilities; only hardened shock-hounds need sniff this out (and what a smell! Did something die in here or something?).  I assume if you've read this far, you're one of those freaks.  So what are you waiting for?  Amazon is a store, y'know.

Side note:  because of these films, Kern was hired by Marilyn Manson to direct his ""Lunchbox"" video, and Kern made it to MTV at last.  More recently, a friend tells me he spotted Kern's name in the photo credits of an issue of ""Barely Legal.""  (That's right, a FRIEND.  I swear I don't read that rag.  I mean it.  Stop Laughing!)  It doesn't seem likely that Kern will ever conquer Hollywood, although that would be a wonderfully sick and twisted idea worthy of one of Kern's films.",1118880000,48,3651,5.031666666666666
1350698,3,B00004TJSH,"Remember the scenes in movies like ""Less Than Zero"" when the characters go to one of those avant-garde bars where all the ""cool"" people hang out, bars where they always have those severely warped art films playing on giant television screens? I'm willing to bet those films came from the mind of someone like Richard Kern, if not Richard Kern himself. ""Hardcore"" is a collection of Kern atrocities packaged together for discerning viewers who care not a whit for such banalities as plot, acting, pacing, or editing. When I came across this DVD on yet another one of my infamous rental excursions, I figured I would give it a shot. Oops. While a few of the ""films"" on the disc inspire some interest, most of the material included in this collection went way over my head. Maybe it's because I don't live in New York City, usually can't stomach obscure, offensive art house cinema (I do love obscure, offensive cinema however--just not art house), and generally appreciate it when the director at least acknowledges the centrality of plot, acting, and pacing. Since many of the films on the disc clock in at just a few minutes, including a couple of music videos, I'm going to try something different with this review. I'm going to reproduce the notes I took when I watched the disc; I wish I could do so word for word but I can't because of the subject matter. Here goes:

Death Valley 69: gory Sonic Youth music video with murdered family and cruise missile imagery. The first of many pieces featuring Lydia Lunch.

The Right Side of My Brain: Love/hate relationship with pornographic sex and atonal sound effects. Female lead engages in internal monologue (nihilistic, of course). Again, with Lydia Lunch and also starring Henry Rollins.

You Killed Me First: Typical story of anarchist kid (Elizabeth) rebelling against family's consumerist and religious values. Ends when the disturbed kid guns her family down.

The B******: I'm censoring this one. Too far over the top to explain what it is. I'm not even going to risk spelling out the title!

The Sewing Circle: Again, I can't say what happens, but this is one intense piece. Nauseating, but interesting if you can stand body mutilation. The girl on the sewing end of the circle is wearing a ""Young Republicans"" T-shirt, too! They all flash identification at the end of the film, probably in an effort to head off an obscenity prosecution.

X is Y: People playing with firearms with telephone sound effects in the background. Music by Cop Shoot Cop.

Fingered: Lydia Lunch mans the phones in this obscene, profanity-laced ode to murder and misogyny.

Horoscope: Woman dreams of dancing with men after reading horoscope and watching ""Studs.""

Submit to Me Now: Oddballs dancing, leering at camera--lots of nonsense--guy shaving a nontraditional part of his body (!) and man ripping his own throat out, woman stabbing herself to death.

My Nightmare: Decidedly unsavory dream sequence.

The Manhattan Love Suicides: First film, Stray Dogs, about artist and persistent fan. Second film, Woman at the Wheel, about woman fighting with men in order to drive her own car (An aside here: I liked this film more than any other in the collection. It is actually quite amusing!) Third film, Thrust in Me, about necrophilia, suicide, and bathtubs. Fourth film, I Hate You Now, about deformed guy and his girlfriend.

Submit to Me: Rehash of Submit to Me Now.

The Evil Cameraman: Another misogynistic piece involving women of all races caught up in rather violent situations. The members of NOW would have a collective heart attack watching this stuff.

Get the idea? That's the best I can do considering the limitations of a public forum. All of these films together run for nearly three hours. Several of them are quite short, at four or five minutes, but The Manhattan Love Suicides consists of four films that run for nearly an hour. Kern's music videos, I must say, aren't that bad. He's obviously not directing videos for Yanni or Kenny G, though. Kern shot most of the films in black and white, probably because of the lower cost of the film stock. The stuff he did in color only serves to bring home in a more forceful way the abject depravity of the subject matter. ""Hardcore"" is definitely not for the kiddies. In fact, if you pop this one in the DVD player when the youngsters are in the room, you might hear social services knocking at your door.

It's difficult to imagine these films have a loyal following. I could see film students studying them since learning how to shoot in any cinematic format is a definite plus when gaining knowledge about the ins and outs of the profession, but just watching this to watch it? Get outta here. Only art house snobs would consider watching ""Hardcore"" a second time, probably in order to identify some deep philosophical meaning that makes them feel superior to the mindless, television watching rabble. I'll buy the notion that much of Kern's work is experimental in nature, and as such does have a certain daring in some of the pieces, but to call it high art is an insult to high art.",1102464000,45,5085,4.795428571428571
1350699,3,B00004TJSH,"I learned about Richard Kern through the back cover of Sonic Youth's EVOL album in which a scene from Submit To Me with Lung Leg was placed.  I soon fell in love with Kern's photography and jumped at the offer to buy the DVD collection when it came out.  I got it, watched it (sometimes barely) and decided I'd rather stick to the photographs.  Don't get me wrong, it's still cool, but maybe not my shtick.  Manhattan Love Suicides was probably my favorite although a few others were decent too.  If you're a diehard fan...get it.  If you're not sure...make sure before you buy.  If you've only heard of him...go with the photography first.",1035072000,9,640,4.56140350877193

7922699,5,B00004TJSH,"How many times have I watched the core group of films in this collection on a lovingly (if illicitly) burned DVD made from my now-completely-thrashed VHS copy? Um, I'm a writer, not a mathematician. I honestly couldn't say, but the simple answer is `a lot'. Are the films here simply that great, that unmissible, that life-changing? Again, a simple - if, perhaps, one that may seem confusing until I tie everything together at the end of this review - `not entirely'. `Not entirely'?! `...BUT...'.... Oh, there's a `but'. Good. Yes, there is a `but', and it's a big one. (No pun intended.) Many of the short films in this collection can almost universally be considered shocking, confusing, and, at times, disgusting - even by me. BUT (yes, there it is) that's not the point. Or perhaps that IS the point - Kern's point, as a filmmaker, at any rate. Kern is an iconic figure in the New York City underground art scene, an innovator of performance art and unapologetic provacatuerism, and the films collected here represent - as the title quite clearly implies - the `hardcore' segment of his repertoire. The films featured here include all of those found on the original VHS release - `Death Valley `69' (1986), `Right Side Of My Brain' (1984), `You Killed Me First' (1985), `The Bitches' (1992), `The Sewing Circle' (1992), `Fingered' (1986), `Submit To Me Now' (1987), `My Nightmare' (1993), `Horoscope' (1991), and `X Is Y' (1990) - and an hour's worth of additional films that have never before been commercially released, including the `Manhattan Love Suicides' trifecta (`Stray Dogs', `Woman At The Wheel', and `Trust In Me' - all from 1985), `Submit To Me' (1986), and `The Evil Cameraman' (1986).  Kern utilizes both color and black-and-white visuals - often within the construct of a single film, to provide contrasting imagery as scenes or points-of-view change - and very little dialogue, making many of these films avant garde music videos, of a sort, for an impressive collection of artists whose music is as difficult for the mainstream to digest as Kern's films: Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers, The Dream Syndicate, Wiseblood, SPK, Cop Shoot Cop, Joseph Budenholzer, Lydia Lunch, Norman Westberg of Swans, Black Snakes (featuring Kern on guitar), and J.G. Thirlwell (aka Clint Ruin, aka Foetus, aka the guy who did all those crazy-good industrial remixes for Pantera, aka just look him up and start buying his records - you'll be glad you did). The majority of the actors in these films - most of whom turn up over and over again - are members of Kern's performance art circle in some capacity, rather than people whose chosen profession is to act, which is perfectly suited to Kern's desires and the final pieces on display here. The few exceptions to this are Henry Rollins - when he was in that `scrawny bodybuilder' period and had long hair and very few tattoos - and a selection of NYC musicians/artists that include Sonic Youth, Lydia Lunch, Norman Westberg, J.G. Thirlwell, Pete Shore of Unsane, and Nick Zedd. The `performance art actors' are generally psuedonymed in some fashion - Lung Leg (ne Elizabeth Carr - aka the cover star of Sonic Youth's `EVOL' and possibly the most well-known of the bunch), Jaqui O., Jessica C., Annabelle, Squeak, Mystery Girl, Cruella DeVille, Audrey Rose, et al - and their roles vary by their abilities... and/or their proclivities. Kern's primary themes throughout `The Hardcore Collection' are graphic - and often unorthodox, by generally accepted social standards - sex; murder; grotesqueness; abandonment; disillusionment; and the popularized - if cartoonishly moribund - concept of occultism. This collection includes some scenes - and, in fact, some entire films - that are difficult at best to sit through for all but those with iron-clad dispositions, and this definitely is not a DVD the average person would want to leave lying around the house for a parent or babysitter or random co-worker to stumble across... BUT it provides an indispensible archival look at the early days of truly independent filmmaking - and kick-ass music - in New York City, along with more than a few cheap thrills (if you want to look at it that way). My verdict: `The Hardcore Collection' is essential to own and essential to view - at least once - for anyone with any interest at all in independent filmmaking, avant-garde art or music, and/or the living beast that is New York City.",1384646400,,4429,4.952956989247312

7922701,2,B00004TJSH,"There's one shot in the film ""Fingered"" which, for me, sums up my feelings about this whole collection. Here it is: a car drives down some winding road outside of Los Angeles, along or near the coast. The road is on the side of a steep mountain with dense vegetation growing through the cracks and on the outcroppings. In real life, it must have been an arresting scene, but the way it's shot, it comes across as gray, lifeless and undersaturated.

Looking at that shot, you realize how many people live their whole lives in that headspace, without a moment of reprieve. It conveys, without using sex or violence or music or even people, a species of endless bleakness.

Is this hardcore? Is this transgressive? I don't know or care. Beyond that one shot, I really didn't find anything else in this collection that gave me food for thought. Maybe this is some weakness inherent in me. Maybe this is the wrong era for these films, because there's probably not any possible fictional film you could make that is as shocking and horrifying as the nightly news. (Think about it!) But I couldn't help feeling like all the ""obscenity"" was designed to cover over their essential emptiness.

I realize that Kern was operating on a budget, and ""perfection"" was probably not an option. But even with a gargantuan budget, I'm not sure he'd have much to say, or if he would say it well. There's no way to know.",1301788800,,1398,4.606425702811245

However, there are about 3-5 shorts including the Death Valley '69 and You Killed Me First that are actually somewhat good. For the rest it was just a headache to sit through.

7922704,4,B00004TJSH,"There are 2 parts to my review. One being my opinion on the content. Two being the quality of the disc itself. I bought this dvd for the mere fact that ""Fingered"" is featured on the disc. That was my sole reason. I was interested in seeing other films by Kern that I hadn't seen, but they all fail compared to Fingered. I would have paid the same price had Fingered been the only film on the disc. The dialog is priceless. The ""acting"" is priceless. It's so bad that it is FANTASTIC. It is truely one of my most favorite films of all time. I saw this film in 1991 and had searched for my own copy for YEARS, finally acquiring a horrible VHS copy. I was so excited when I learned that I could have Kern's masterpiece on DVD. BUT...

The second part is on the media itself. The disc. There was a defect in the disc itself. I was watching the disc. Watching Fingered to be exact. A couple of minutes in, and the film started freezing and then the dvd would just stop. Finally, i took the dvd out of the player and could notice an anomaly in the disc. No other film was affected on the disc. Just FINGERED! Image my frustration. I would not have cared if the entire disc was affected accept for Fingered, but unfortunately that was not the case. So I return the disc to Amazon and request a replacement. I get the replacement in a couple of days. Lo and behold: the same issue. Obviously, this is a manufacturing problem and has nothing to do with Amazon.

So, the disc is worth buying, but you are taking a chance on a defective product.",1212969600,,1534,4.2320819112627985
