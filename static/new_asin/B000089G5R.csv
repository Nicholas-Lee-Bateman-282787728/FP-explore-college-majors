1831360,4,B000089G5R,"I just spent the weekend with my two granddaughters and one of the movies that we watched was the new Rolie Polie and we were not disappointed.  As always it was packed full of family values, love for one another and doing the right thing! Good job!
The characters were adorable and it was very colorful and full of life.  The only downside was that Pappy was not there! We missed him! A good movie to share with your little ones! Enjoy!",1055376000,4,437,4.317073170731708
1831361,4,B000089G5R,"My wife and I are very protective of our children (1-5 years old), and we don't let them watch many movies--in fact, even our oldest child has only seen about a dozen movies all the way through.  But this Rolie Polie Olie movie, like its predecessor, was not only very decent, but also actively taught positive values, like the goodness of life and love of family.  Originally a two-day rental from the video store, this is being added to our collection ASAP.",1054944000,4,459,4.585365853658536
1831362,4,B000089G5R,"My two year old is a big fan of Rolie Polie Olie and I must say that this movie was a lot better then The Great Defender of Fun movie.  This is a more up beat, happy movie with some very cute songs and a very cute story line.  It's a very retro new age way in cartoons with its' bright colors and wonderful characters!  This is a very entertaining show.  The only thing bad I have to say is that these cartoons are usually around ten to fifteen minutes in length and this is a lot longer for a child to sit through and may get bored.  But for the older kids it would be fine.",1054857600,10,575,3.8803418803418803
1831363,2,B000089G5R,"Our household loves Rolie Polie Olie. We ran right out on June 3, 2003 to purchase this dvd. What a disappointment when we sat and watched this film about ""Family frolicking fun"" and Pappy was no where in the entire movie!!! Pappy's name was not even mentioned. I'm sorry, but Rolie Polie Olie without Pappy is like popcorn without butter.",1054684800,,339,4.666666666666667

1831406,5,B000089G5R,"It's absolutely amazing how much my son loves this show. He is borderline addicted to it. Either they are using brainwashing techniques or he just really likes the show, not sure which one.

Things become sort of pathetic when you begin to use annoying words and phrases the Polies use on the show. This show also has that disgusting cutzie thing going on, where it so cutzie that it makes your average adult recoil in terror. But the children enjoy it... For some reason...",1296691200,,474,4.642857142857143

1831412,5,B000089G5R,"My kids (ages 3 and 4) LOVE this movie! We bought this move on a whim, and I was so pleasantly suprised when we watched it for the first time. The baby robots leave the ""mother ship"" and are found by the Olie family who, in trying to help them get home, fall in love with them and end up adopting them! What touched me the most was the description of the mother ship as ""a happy place where babies live until they find their forever families"". As an adoptive mother, it is very important to me for my children to have a positive view of their precious birthmothers and know that they were loved and cared for even before they were placed in our arms. The entire movie is so happy and upbeat, and my kids love all the songs. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to hear giggles and singing from their kids on roadtrips!",1091577600,9,831,4.2
1831413,5,B000089G5R,"Although not as good as the original Polie movie, Baby Bot Chase carries over the good clean fun.  My daughter does not get to watch much television or movies because most are so inappropriate.  However, the Polies are fun, upbeat, positive, overcome challenges with problem solving, they work together with family and friends, and there is no violence or shouting.  I don't mind that my little one is 'addicted' to the Polie family movies!
Also, we bought the VHS version this time, but wish we'd gone with the DVD.  The DVD does a much better job of displaying the amazing graphics in the film.",1059350400,7,596,4.701923076923077
