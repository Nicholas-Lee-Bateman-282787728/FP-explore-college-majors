8266254,1,B000YSBK6G,"""Abomination: The Evilmaker II"" truly lives up to its name. This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is relentlessly cheap, nonsensical, and features some of the worst special effects of the last fifty years. Incorporating every gothic horror clich imaginable, the film opens with some confusing backstory (in mixed color and black and white; pointless flashback fans will love this part) about an evil house, murder, and adultery, all before the opening credits roll. Because the flashbacks are anything but lucid, there is a priceless television reporter reporting on the deaths in question; he even interviews psychic ""Madame Vladmeria"" (Shannon...yes, that's her entire credit) who says the house where these deaths may or may not have taken place in is just really, really evil, prompting the exclamation from the hardened TV journalist ""Sounds like a poltergeist to me!""

The acting here is exceptionally bad, breathtaking even. The ultra-slow exposition gets under way with a candle-intensive ritual in the dark house (note the lengthy scene of total blackness, heightening the conspicuity of the darkness) in which homely Goth chicks exchange dialogue like ""Come back to the circle now!"" If you think the dialogue is poor, wait until you get a load of the next round of special effects in which one tormented soul writhes in agony and produces what appears to be tapioca pudding from under her shirt. (Just don't ask.) I also don't think it would be a spoiler to mention that glowing red eyes are a sign of demonic possession (none too subtle, I know, but perhaps the least offensive aspect of the film.)

Somehow an ex-cop named Charles (Jon Wilmot, who is totally believable in the role, and who was wrongfully drummed out of the force due to the most contrived plotpoint in history) and the women end up pursuing each other around the dark creepy house for the better part of an hour. Believe me the minutes will just crawl by. During this time there are multiple twists and turns that should be interesting but are so nonsensical as to be laughable, and some alleged sultriness gone horribly awry (hint: do not look at the tattoo or the teeth...I have never wanted to see less of a woman.) I have a question: when running for your life is it normal to curl up on a bathroom floor next to a clawfoot tub and go to sleep? Just wondering. This is the truth: my thoughts while they were going nuts in the house were to examine what a truly hideous structure it was, and to wonder to which of the cast or crew members did it belong. In particular the room with the blue ceiling had the worst roller painting I have ever seen (note the white walls with roller contact) and there are some great close-ups of some truly hideous textured carpeting as well. That is seriously what I found most interesting. If you watch the movie, you will see why.

As the movie wraps to some very unique theology (largely courtesy of Charles) we are treated to a Three Stooges variety head bonk (the highlight of the film) and one of the sisters (Rachel; Felicia Pandolfi) fights herself with the worst special effects in recent memory. The film concludes with Kathy (Kylene Wetherell, who also gets a catering credit!) pontificating a lot, ultimately closing with a seemingly tacked-on bit of tripe veritably begging for a sequel.

""Abomination"" truly is one.",1329436800,2,3376,4.805507745266781
8266255,1,B000YSBK6G,"Looks like it was filmed with an old home video camera. The story is hard to follow, not that you will care after the first 5 minutes. The girls are hideous to look at, and not in a cool goth type of way.

This movie literally looks like it was made by 6th graders or something. I can't believe a movie this cruddy actually got such a wide distribution. What a piece of garbage.

There is not one redeeming aspect for this movie. Avoid at all costs!",1283990400,,449,4.149425287356322
