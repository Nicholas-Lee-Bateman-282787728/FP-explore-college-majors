8681825,5,B00O3GUZ16,"TEENAGE STRANGLER (aka: TERROR IN THE NIGHT- 1964) jumps off w/ the titular marauder, taking down a female victim! A stocking around her neck, and an ""X"" written in lipstick on her forehead, the poor 27 year old teen is loaded into the meat wagon! Police are suitably stumped. This is all set in a small town, where everyone speaks V-E-R-Y L-O-U-D-L-Y! Sometimes, they're yelling, as if talking to my great grandfather! Anyway, who is the killer? Some crazed stocking / lipstick salesman? Or, worse still, could it have been ""one of the kids""? Could it have been ""a Bulldog""?! Meanwhile, twisting erupts at the local diner! Look out! The mega-omni hit, ""Yipe Stripes"" explodes! A cop arrives, and yells at everyone. He takes some members of the Bulldogs ""downtown"", to yell at them. Then, they yell at each other! Could ""drag racing"" be involved? Back at home, parents yell at their offspring! 32 year old Jimmy's in trouble w/ his 85 year old dad! His brother, Mikey, who sounds like Kermit T. Frog's wimpy twin, whines and moans. Could Jimmy be the strangler? Betty hopes not, as she sits w/ David Schwimmer's dad at the diner. What was the attraction of this diner? The food? No one ever seems to eat! Poor Betty! Is her boyfriend a misanthropic, murdering maniac? Oh my gosh! Another victim, garroted in her own bathtub! There's gonna be some real yelling now! Jimmy gets collared. Betty gets fretful. Mikey becomes even more of a fist-magnet! At the high school, fisticuffs break out! This all leads to the inevitable drag racing / chase scene showdown! All this, as the relentless killer strikes again! Will he never run out of lipstick? Who supplies him w/ his stockings? A local cartel? Hmmm. Do not miss the ""could-see-it-coming-from-a-million-stockings-away"" SHOCK finale! You'll be better for it!... P.S.- Stick around, as Betty gets down w/ the kids at a diner twist-a-thon!...",1513987200,,1889,4.88785046728972
