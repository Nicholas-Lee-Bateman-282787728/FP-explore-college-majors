916658,1,6304737505,"Disney under Michael Eisner has an agenda; that agenda is exhibited in this falsified version of Charles Dickens' second novel, Oliver Twist. There is no question that Dickens intended to protray Fagin as a miscreant of nearly supernatural villainy. This Eisner-Disney version has re-written Dickens in order to protray Fagin as a basically benevolent character, with Bill Sykes transformed into the principal evil-doer.

Unfortunately this mess of a movie will attract a great deal of attention due to the presence of actor Elijah Wood. But viewers seeking a film faithful to Dickens' original should access the lengthy 1985 BBC production distributed by CBS/Fox on video, or the David Lean classic on DVD.

Once again, the venerable Disney name is being misused to market an Eisner counterfeit which censors a classic work for purposes of aligning it with Eisner's twisted sense of political correctness. It should be renamed Eisner Twist.",1042156800,5,941,5.308724832214765

I watched like bits and pieces of it when it premired on the wonderful world of Disney even though I haven't seen the whole film I know it will be good. This movie takes you on a adventure that you and your family will enjoy the story starts with 10 year old Oliver Twist who is kicked out of the workhouse from begging for some more food. Soon after that Oliver is taken too live with a undertaker who has two other servants Noah and Charolette who are somewhat strict. Soon Oliver runaway's too London where he meets The Artful Dodger ( Elijah Wood) who teaches him about the rules around London and takes him under his wing with Fagain's help (Richard Drefuss) Oliver soons begins his first job at pick a pocketing. Mr. Bronalow the man whom Oliver steals from takes him home and treats him well Oliver thinks it's fair still Bill Sikes wants Oliver too help him steal something very valuable from him. Nancy and Bill scheme Oliver into sneaking into Mr. Bronalow's house and stealing his money soon Nacy dies cause of physical abuse. Soon Dodger takes Oliver where he belongs while he and Fagain get arrested for the crime commiting still Dodger knew that Oliver would be happy with Bill dead. Also Oliver discovers that Rose is his aunt and he decided's too go live with her. I love this movie cause Elijah Wood is brillant the drama in this film can leave you at the end of your seat.

Also it shows what life was like for homeless teenagers by using the Artful Doger, and Nancy. The actors and actresses did a good job in their parts.

916992,2,6304737505,"Note: The following review assumes the reader has knowledge of Charles Dickens' novel ""Oliver Twist."" Therefore, be cautioned ~~ PLOT DETAILS are revealed.

This is an approximately 90 minute Disney adaptation. It has some merits but numerous problems. To begin, the film deviates substantially from the novel. Secondly, the actors are not well-suited for their roles. This is especially true for Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Fagin.

Because the film is for children, less than 90 minutes, and low-budgeted, many characters and scenes are eliminated. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry do not exist in this production. Charles Bates, Mr. Monks, Mr. Grimwig, Toby, and Noah Claypole are also eliminated. Bulls-eye is not eliminated.

The locket also plays an important role in this production. However, because Monks is not a character, Oliver actually takes the locket with him to London, where Fagin takes the locket and keeps it `safe' for Oliver. Afterward, Oliver strives to get the locket back to prove to Mr. Brownlow and Rose Maylie that he is related to them. It is important to note that Rose is Mr. Brownlow's niece in this film adaptation. Furthermore, Oliver's mother is Mr. Brownlow's daughter. Therefore, with the locket, Oliver could prove that he is Mr. Brownlow's grandson and heir.

The film becomes slightly Shakespearean with the numerous psychological plot twists. For example, Oliver's allegiance is torn between Fagin, Sikes, Nancy, and the Dodger, each of whom abuses Oliver in some way, and Mr. Brownlow and Rose. The clearest abuse is from Sikes, who simply wants to exploit Oliver to (1) get back at Fagin, since Oliver knows where Fagin's treasure is hidden, and (2) use Oliver to rob Mr. Brownlow and/or people like him. Fagin, likewise, uses Oliver as he does other boys to rob and bring in money. Additionally, Fagin desires Oliver's locket, and does much to keep Oliver from getting it back.

Furthermore, Oliver is not so innocent in this film. Oliver does help Sikes successful job Mr. Brownlow, even without having a gun put to his head. Secondly, Oliver does attempt to pick Mr. Brownlow's pocket at the bookstore (even though the Dodger ends up being the one who actually steals the wallet). Even before meeting Fagin, Oliver attempts to snatch an apple from a stand but is caught by Dawkins. Therefore, the theme of Oliver's innate goodness is not really legitimized in this adaptation. Oliver is seen as a typical lower-class boy torn among various allegiances.

Sikes does murder Nancy in this film, although the murder takes place on a dock and not in Sikes' room. Furthermore, Sikes accidentally hangs himself in this film (one detail that makes the film better than the horrible 2007 BBC adaptation).

Sikes is pure evil in this film. With the exception possibly the 2005 adaptation, I don't think any color adaptation exists with a more menacing Sikes. Sikes glorifies in being a master criminal. Sikes does not seem to care that he killed people in his life. Even Nancy's death does not seem to have as great an affect on Sikes as in the 2005 adaptation. Immediately before Sikes hangs himself, he flaunts how he is going to outmaneuver the police and the mob below.

At the end of the film, Fagin is left to continue living his miserable misery existence. Fagin's treasure is not taken from him, although does get his locket back, which allows him to legitimize that he is Mr. Brownlow's grandson.

Overall, film, shot in 4:3 ratio, has some merits and originality. However, it is very Disneyized.

Personally, I recommend the 1985 BBC adaptation for people who seriously want the novel re-enacted as accurately as possible.
For individuals who want an interested adaptation with an excellent picture quality (2.35:1 aspect ratio), I recommend the 2005 adaptation with Barney Clark and Ben Kingley.",1265414400,2,3845,5.031446540880503
916993,4,6304737505,"I would give this review 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I've got to settle on a tentative 4. This is maybe the best family film based on Dicken's classic story of Oliver. With excessive characters and side-plots done away with in recrafting the main plot, it's less dense without being too fluffy, and it's gritty enough without being (as the novel is, at times) frighteningly violent. Most of the actors carry their parts well, except for the man who played as Bill Sykes, and the child actor who played as Oliver. Elijah Wood did good acting, with his facial expressions and body-language delivering the right emotions at the right time, and though his accent wasn't the most brilliant I've ever heard, he was entirely consistent in his usage of it, which is saying a lot! He fell short, due to misguided directing, of living up to the name of ""Artful Dodger"". It was very, very silly to have him leading around such a huge band of little theives. In real life, they would have made the police suspicious and been arrested within an hour . . . but that wasn't Wood's fault. In the book Fagin sent the boys out in either alone or in small groups. The Artful and Charley Bates were a twosome, and then when Oliver joined them they were a trio -- and the Artful always made sure they remained inconspicuous. As for Sykes, this movie's interpretation of him was so cartoonish it was all but laughable. Sykes in the book was less ranting and more cruely sarcastic, less of a raving hot-head and more coldly menacing. Though he often was hysterically violent, the creepy thing about him was that his *bite* was always worse than his *bark*. Fagin is a lost cause -- he is not Dicken's Fagin. But the actor carried well the part of the Fagin custom-made for this movie. The one thing that should definately have been changed was the potrayel of Oliver: the child actor who played him was as composed in all the filth and violence as a school-boy who just stepped off the bus.",1181692800,,1967,4.512605042016807

917049,3,6304737505,"Let me start of by saying that my title line is not prompted by any fan girlieness!

I borrowed this movie from a friend and found it much better then I had expected. Visually it was easy to look at, but not so much as to be unbeleivable. Dreyfuss was wonderful and very fun to watch. Elijah Wood lived up to what I've come to expect from his films. His portrayal of the Artful Dodger was both funny and heart breaking at same time. And his accent managed to stay in place rather well. My biggest qualm is the kid they got to play Oliver, he comes across as pretty shallow and unemotive or whiny at best. The character of Oliver was surprisingly badly written as he came across as a rather selfish little boy who cared for no one except himself and his mother's necklace. While Nancy and the Dodger both go unhappy fates ultimatly, for him.

I'd reccomend it as a fun watch, so long as you can ignore the title character!",1102291200,5,921,4.287356321839081
917050,5,6304737505,"It's not quite Dickens' classic novel, but then again, I ask you; what is?  ""Oliver Twist"" is a brilliant film despite the fact that the story is not quite the way old Charles Dickens wrote it.  When viewing this film one must remember that it was meant to appeal to a great number of people and not just to those who love literature.  It was also meant to be a family film, which is why it is not as dreary or complicated as the original novel was.

One must also remember too, that this film was originally created for television.

The cast is great, especially Elijah Wood who played the Artful Dodger and Antoine Byrne who played Nancy.  The young boy who played Oliver could have been a little better prepared for the part, but still he did a wonderful job.  I have also never seen anyone portray Fagin in such an amusing manner as Richard Dreyfuss.

Overall the film is fun as well as funny and is sure to be an enjoyment to the entire family.  For those who want to see a film that is based more closely to the novel I would suggest trying another version.",1096588800,9,1063,4.301507537688442
917051,2,6304737505,"First of all, I don't understand this widow Corney having a locket belonging to Oliver (a locket than can lead him to his family), telling him about it and not doing anything to find them. In the book, there is also a locket which is an evidence of Oliver's identity, but Oliver doesn't know anything about it till the end of the story.

So we have this Oliver travelling to London, but he looks a happy boy. The true Oliver is sad.

But I find this Oliver able to move around almost free, while he is suposed to be a menace to Fagin's gang. and at the end he can make Fagin give him his locket, telling him he would peach. I think that even the most evil characters are comical.

A film to spend your time, but as the topic says: ""The book is better"".",1094428800,4,752,4.136986301369863
917052,5,6304737505,"I have seen two other versions of Oliver Twist, the excellent BBC version, and the rather weak musical ""Oliver!"". The BBC version is the closest to the book, so if you are a fan of it, watch that one. ""Oliver!"", in my opinion, really did not get across the message of the book, nor the tragedy of the characters' lives either. If you can't stand a change from Dickens' classic, don't watch this movie. But if you are open-minded, a fan of Disney or Elijah Wood, you'll like this movie. It has all the basic outlines of the Oliver Twist story, Oliver asking for more, going to London and meeting up with Fagin, Nancy's death at the hands of Bill Sikes, et cetera. But the details are changed a great deal, for instance, Dodger's and Rose's parts are both enlarged, which I like. I read the book around the same time I saw this movie and I noticed two parts in the movie that are in the book and did not make it into the other versions.
(1) The little boy at the workhouse who says ""God bless you!"" to Oliver.
(2) The means of Bill Sikes's death: that is, slipping and catching his neck in the rope. BBC has him actually fall off the roof, while Oliver! has him shot by police(boring!).
 Elijah Wood is absolutely wonderful in this. I know his accent was not very accurate but his acting is perfect (as always). If you are a fan of his, you HAVE to watch this movie. Elijah Wood's version of this character  is very different from BBC's evil-minded follower of Fagin, Oliver!'s ridiculous clown, or the book's sneering Artful. Here is a Dodger who really comes alive, who you can sympathize with, who breaks your heart when he's taken off to jail. I agree with ""a viewer"" that it is Elijah Wood as Dodger and Antoine Byrne as Nancy who really save this film. Antoine Byrne's performance is touching, and really shows the tragedy of what Nancy's life was. If it were not for these two, this movie would not be worth watching. I've read the reviews, and I know some people love this movie, while others are furious that they dared tamper with the storyline. Keep an open mind, and give this a try!",1093651200,6,2093,4.405684754521964
917053,2,6304737505,"OLIVER TWIST, the Charles Dickens novel of crime and childhood corruption in Victorian England, is perhaps one of the most adapted works in film.  With such classic characters such as the innocent Oliver Twist, the master-thief Fagin, the touching Nancy and the comical Mr. Bumble, adapting the novel to the screen has proved to be a filmmaker and actor's dream.  Probably the best versions out today are the classic 1951 David Lean version and the merry 1968 musical version, OLIVER!  Of course, there are many other film and TV versions as well.  This 1997 version produced by Walt Disney Co. for their ""Wonderful World of Disney"" TV show is unfortunately one of the lesser versions of this classic tale despite some handsome production values.
Part of the reasoning of this low opinion stems from a rather rambling screenplay that almost completely changes the title character (played by Alex Trench) from a put-upon victim into an overly spunky and almost overly abrasive tyke.  It's not Trench's fault in that he does a good job with this rather false characterization, but he ends up seeming more suited to playing the Artful Dodger than Oliver Twist.  In contrast, Elijah Wood's performance as the Artful Dodger comes across as overly mannered and laid back.  As a result, his Dodger seems ill-equipped emotionally to be a ""street educated"" tough.
The pivotal role of Fagin, that master teacher of young pickpockets, has undergone much revision since Dickens first created him.  Originally a slimy, nasty Jewish stereotype, the character has been softened to the point of sometimes being comic relief.  Of course, this is due to modern sensibilities that have dictated the de-emphasis on racial stereotypes. That in itself isn't a bad thing as Ron Moody's masterful performance in OLIVER! showed, but Richard Dreyfus seems ill-prepared in the role.  Wandering around in a false nose and gravelly voice, Dreyfus is inconsistent in the role and turns a star turn into something merely average.  David O' Hara and Antoine Byrne are more successful in their roles of the brutal Bill Sikes and his ill-fated lover, Nancy.  Unfortunately, the screenplay gives these characters rather short shift and they don't get much of a chance to make an impression.  Indeed, the movie streamlines the classic story to an almost absurd degree with the elimination of classic characters and situations such as Mr. Bumble and Oliver's apprenticeship to the funeral parlor of the cruel Sowerberrys.
At about 90 minutes, the movie seems to go faster than it does because of the absurd trimming.  The Walt Disney Company does not do the classic story justice and leaves the viewer feeling very unsatisfied as a result.  This movie may be handsome to look at, but this is not a version that I would recommend.  Stick with the classic David Lean or 1968 musical version for a better and more satisfying experience.",1082678400,25,2896,5.027196652719665
