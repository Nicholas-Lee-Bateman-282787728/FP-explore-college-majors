8741974,5,B018AXRNGC,"I have several of Mindy's cycle workouts.  Short and Sweet was my favorite.  This has similar workouts and allows you to customize by mixing and matching.  Many reviewers complain about her chattiness.  However, the workouts provide visual cues for what to do with timers and color-coded prompts.  So once you get the hang of what to do, it is easy to turn down the volume and crank up your own playlist.",1500422400,3,404,4.633802816901408

8741978,5,B018AXRNGC,"This DVD follows the new science on interval training whereby you go fast for X seconds and then slow for Y seconds and then fast again, in intervals. Mindy goes hard, harder, hardest and ""over the top"". You get a real workout on the bike. I don't care for the music though but you can turn it off.",1465689600,5,298,4.155172413793103
