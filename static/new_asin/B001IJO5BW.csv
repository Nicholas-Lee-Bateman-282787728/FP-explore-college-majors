Loaded with wonderful art, stickers, and special features galore, this package serves as a thank you for the fans, which is sweet and rare compared to most hurried-out special editions.

The episode commentaries are the only weak point. Rich Fulcher is awful in this role, which makes it worse because he seems to dictate every conversation. It's still a must-buy for fans of the show.",1440288000,,521,4.788888888888889

3648723,4,B001IJO5BW,"The two lead characters is likeable, the music is good, and the humor is fairly decent.

This is sort of the British version of ""Flight of the Concords"" (I don't know which series occurred first).  There's music, there's humor; and there are wacky situations.  This series delves far more into fantasy and science fiction (there is a cab trip to hell, for instance).

The two lead characters are particularly good when talking to one another and when they stay in character.  I think if you check in YouTube and look up ""The Mighty Boosh"" and Jazz trance, you will get an idea as to their humor.  Here is a link (not sure if links are allowed here):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKwQ_zeRwEs  ""No one listens to jazz; just science teachers and the mentally ill.""  I should mention that the quality of the DVD picture is better than in the YouTube link.

Their humor is often quick, goofy, clever, even Monty-Pythonish from time to time; and sometimes slapstick.  Some of it works; some of it doesn't.  Enough of it works so that you will appreciate it.

I think that the first season is by far the best.  They have some good bits in the 2nd and 3rd season, but most of it can be found in the 1st season.

Speaking of which, if memory serves, the humor does not deal as much with drugs and jazz in the 1st season (so you won't mind your kids watching it); but these are targets of humor in the 2nd and 3rd seasons.

I enjoy the music as well.  Do they have a CD out yet?

No laugh track.  I like that.  That allows me to decide whether or not something is funny.

I gave this entire DVD 4 stars.  Some bits are worth 5 stars, but overall 4 stars.",1433721600,2,1648,4.387417218543046

3648726,5,B001IJO5BW,Excellent series and way far out comedy for those who like something different.  Great dialogue and music too.  I think this package with all three seasons may be out of print?  Not sure why the price is all hiked up as of now (02-16-16).,1432512000,,238,4.363636363636363

3648764,5,B001IJO5BW,"I LOVE THE BOOSH! I just wish they'd reform and do another series! This is a very complete collection with all kinds of extras I wasn't even expecting. Multiple documentaries, commentaries, the original un-aired pilot episode and so much more.",1412380800,,243,5.1
3648765,5,B001IJO5BW,"Easily one of the Best series ever created. Well worth any price to own this amazing collection. My first thought when I saw this series was, ""Wow someone made a more adult story version of Pee Wee Herman"" Now too explain I started on season three when I originally started watching the series on TV. I didn't know there had been three seasons and of course each season is set differently, looks different and just feels unique from each other season.

This series is just brilliant, unique, fun and has comedy unlike anything ever seen before. Its such a fun, creative, and original take on comedy and television. Not too mention the actors involved in this are some of the funniest comedians in the industry. Each character is so innovative and hilarious its truly amazing.

There is not much else out there in the genre to rival this series the only other show I have enjoyed as much as this series was Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. And if you love the Boosh then I am sure you Loved Darkplace.

One note of warning after enjoying this series as well as with Darkplace you will become a little jaded to the status quo of television. You will recover fast though, I suggest taking one Breaking Bad, Doctor Who, and a It's Always Sunny for help.

This show really is a Fantastic Journey through Time and Space. I know I wanted more after watching everything in this DVD set. I ended up buying all the live shows and anything else related to this series. I know Noel Fielding has another show of similar craziness but different called Luxury Comedy, that is fun as well.

I can't say enough about this show. I could ramble on and on about it, and finding another fan where I live is quite a rare and exciting experience. Fans of this show share one common trait, enjoyment of creative artistic comedy.  It is one of the greatest television shows of all time.

5 Stars!",1412208000,,1866,4.535714285714286

3648767,5,B001IJO5BW,"The funniest TV show I am aware of. Absolutely brilliant, creative, off-the-wall comedy that is actually laugh-out-loud funny at the same time as being innovative.

The whole box set is a delight, from the episodes, to the extras, (which are often hidden as Easter eggs on the main menus) to the post cards and stickers included with purchase. :) Absolutely worth the cost. This is not the sort of sitcom you watch through once and think, 'been there, done that:' the subtle & intelligent jokes mingle with the obvious & slapstick so there's always a new one-liner to notice.

So, one day out of boredom and a lack of anything new to watch I decided to sit down and see what The Mighty Boosh was all about. I became instantly addicted. It usually takes me awhile to enjoy British comedy(Are You Being Served?, Keeping Up Appearances, etc.)but not this show. The duo of Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly. They feed off of each other and appear as if they have been together forever. The stories are funny and each episode has a catchy song, not unlike The Flight of the Conchords.

This box set includes interviews and a kind of tour of how Noel Fielding and Julia Barratt got started and met and interviews with the people around the duo. The set also includes the pilot where Richard Ayoade is playing Dixon Bainbridge. Ayaode would later go on to play the shaman, Saboo in the regular series with Matt Berry assuming the Bainbridge character.

3648826,5,B001IJO5BW,"Absolutely brilliant and bizarre show that chronicles the strange adventures of Howard Moon and Vince Noir. The characters are really original and unforgettable...Old Gregg, Milky Joe, Tony Harrison(this is an outrage!!) the Crack Fox, Bob Fossil-the zoo manager who can't remember the names of the animals (elephant: ""grey leg face man, he's got legs, then another leg on his face""). There are a lot of on-going gags in the episodes and seasons: every time Howard is faced with death, he says ""I've got so much to give!"", Vince always comes to Howard's rescue (effortlessly, a lot of the time), Vince is often referred to as ""lady"", or Howard's ""ugly wife.""

I was very surprised to find out that Noel Fielding played a lot of the characters. I've seen a few interviews with him and he seems like a soft spoken, chill kind of guy and I couldn't believe that he was The Hitcher or The Spirit of Jazz, he's a pretty incredible character actor. Noel and Julian also did all of the music for the show, which is AMAZING. I'm constantly singing Old Gregg's ""Love Games"" song, ""Eels"", and the Nanageddon song,(Na-na-ged-don..Na-na-ged-don..!).

I've heard this show compared to Monty Python, Tim and Eric's Awesome Show, and Flight of the Conchords, but I really think it is totally original and something that hasn't been done before like this. To anyone who hasn't seen The Mighty Boosh before, make sure you watch the unedited versions (I'd recommend picking up this DVD set. All complete episodes, tons of extras, artwork, stickers!), not the episodes aired on Adult Swim, they cut out a lot of the episodes and you won't see it in its full glory.",1326758400,4,1645,4.829787234042553

3648829,5,B001IJO5BW,"Initially, I didn't like the Boosh. I caught them on Adult Swim and idiotically lumped them in with Tim & Eric, who have also since grown on me. But they are two entirely different creatures, particularly when seen in these, the full-length episodes that were cut when shown on AS.

Following two hipster-man-children, Vince and Howard, and their surreal adventures, The Mighty Boosh is a heir to Monty Python and The Young Ones, though perhaps less disjointed and more musical than those shows. Each season of the show revolves around a primary location (a zoo, a flat, and a shop respectively) and the strange things that occur there and really...anywhere else. A hermaphrodite mermaid, talking gorilla, guru from space and eel-tongued vagabond are just a few of the creatures they encounter throughout the show.

And the music. The brilliant, brilliant music. From rap to jazz, new wave to ""crimping"" (be prepared), almost every episode has wonderfully catchy, dirty, clever and stupid songs that will not leave your head. My coworkers and I do occasionally break into a crimp. You will too.

Also: Bob Fossil.

I've tried to get friends interested in it by directing them to clips online, but it just doesn't work. I think you need to watch a whole episode to get hooked. And, once you are sucked into it, you'll have to follow the surreal journey all the way to the end. Their insanity will help keep you sane.

My favorite episode is probably ""The Nightmare of Milky Joe"" from Series 2 / Disc 3. I don't know how many times I have caught myself singing the Milky Joe song. There is something in every episode that cracks me up, though.

If you are going to buy the Mighty Boosh DVDs, then you might as well get this special edition set. The seventh disc has bonus footage on it (gives you background on the show), and you get some stickers, artwork, and a nice box. Who wouldn't want all of that?

3648859,5,B001IJO5BW,"Is the question you'll probably ask alot if your not familiar with the Boosh.  A hysterically funny British Comedy duo, who don't seem to keep an accurate running connection between their three different series (season one Howard is older than Vince, season three they are the same age and went to school together), this of course just adds to the show.  Each season can easily stand alone or you can follow along as the boys move from zoo to shop keepers together with their friends Naboo the enigma, Bollo the gorilla and the many different characters portrayed by Rich Fulcher.
If you're not familiar with the Boosh the best way to approach this show is to watch an episode and return to it a week later even if you didn't like it, because it tends to sneak up and fascinate you against your will.  So even if you don't like it in the beginning theres a good chance that you'll be sucked down into the Boosh before you know it.",1271462400,,930,4.458823529411765

3648867,5,B001IJO5BW,"Sometimes I wonder what they have in the water in England. First they produced ""Monty Python,"" and now they have ""The Mighty Boosh.""

And while the basic description sounds like a slightly-out-of-the-ordinary sitcom, the reality is anything but. ""The Mighty Boosh: The Special Edition Seasons 1-3"" is a sitcom drizzled with acid and punched through with the surreal, where the most mundane activities become freakishly bizarre. Lots of raunchy humor, silly puppets, songs and journeys into other realms -- it's a head-trip, and you'll love every second of it.

It follows the awkward cream-poet Howard Moon (Julian Barratt) and flamboyant wacky Vince Noir (Noel Fielding). In the first season, the two guys work at a zoo called the Zooniverse, then they live together in a flat (with an extraterrestrial mystic and an ape) as they try to break into the music business, and finally Howard is employed at a boutique called the Nabootique (owned by aforementioned mystic) while Vince continues trying to break into music.

Along the way we've got the Hitcher (eels!), breeding yetis, the Spirit of Jazz, a deranged sea hermaphrodite called Old Gregg, black magic and Shaman Juice, Nanageddon, a ""Fantastic Voyage"" to save Vince from an evil jazz cell, a pair of copycats who mimic everything Vince and Howard do, the Crack Fox, a mad scientist kidnapping animals, drainpipe pants, the sapphire Egg of Mantumbi, and kangaroo boxing. And that's only SOME of it.

""The Mighty Boosh"" is your basic average sitcom... on enough acid to fry its colorful little brains and send it flying across the universe on Naboo's magic carpet. This is a universe where the moon regularly says weird and nonsensical things, an extraterrestrial shaman and a talking gorilla live in the next room, and random things happen all the time (why is Howard dressed like Gandalf?) -- and these aren't the weirdest things that go on.

As if the plots weren't surreal enough, Barratt and Fielding swathe the entire series in a sort of whimsical weirdness. Lots of strange dialogue  (""Some say he is the devil himself. Others say he is a man pretending to be the devil with green makeup and special lighting""), toilet humor (naturally), bizarre life-forms (Yetis! Wizards! Aliens! Old Gregg and his... oh, I can't say it!), weird outfits for Vine, and a casual acceptance that anything can and will happen.

But the crowning touch is Barrett and Fielding. Howard is rather fuddy-duddy, awkward and considers himself artistic, while Vince is dandyish, arrogant and has the attention span of a gnat -- and both actors are brilliant at bringing these guys to life (as well as various side roles like the moon and a pair of shamans). And Michael Fielding"" is utterly brilliant as the weirdly sedate shaman Naboo.

Surreal, trippy and utterly bizarre, ""The Mighty Boosh"" is one of those wonderfully bizarre shows doesn't even need a laugh track. I have to kiss you passionately on the mouth!",1266019200,13,2951,4.995926680244399

3648892,5,B001IJO5BW,"This is comedy for smart people - highly intelligent silliness, is how I would sum it up.  I was first introduced to this show when it showed up in my netflix recommendations.  I started with season 3, then watched seasons 1 and 2.  By the time I was done, I was ready to watch them all over again, so I decided to go ahead and buy the dvds.  Both of those are rare events - I can't remember the last time I liked something so much I wanted to watch it again immediately, and as a rule I don't buy dvds (why should I when they're so easy to rent?).  What sets this show apart for me is the range of talent of both Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt.  Noel was an art student when he and Julian first started performing together, he designs many of the costumes and the look of the show.  Julian is a very versatile musician and composes all of the music, in a wide range of styles.  This isn't just normal, everyday comedy - both of them have extremely fertile imaginations that takes them out of the humdrum into the fantastical.  In one episode they find an amulet, they push the button and end up on another planet, but when it's time to go home it doesn't work - the batteries have gone dead.  They make friends with coconuts,  spurn advances from transsexual sea creatures, and become possessed by the spirit in a voodoo jazz LP, to name a few examples.  The other thing that I love about it is that in general, it is very good-natured.  They don't make fun of people or types, or put people in difficult positions.  Noel's character, Vince Noir, does like to tease Howard Moon (Julian Barratt), but he often does it with a smile, you can feel the depth of the bond between the two of them (which is expressed more directly in various episodes - especially The Party, season 3).  It is without reserve the best entertainment I have come across in years.  I really hope they release the live dvd over here, and maybe even come back for a tour???",1255478400,19,1947,4.3076923076923075
3648893,5,B001IJO5BW,I got hooked on this show after seeing it on adult swim. I just got the box set a day early 10/12/09 and it's even better than what they show on adult swim here in the States. There's plenty of extra footage that I've already noticed and i've only gotten through disc 1 of 7. The first six discs are all three seasons and the 7th is all bonus material. Great Buy!,1255305600,5,363,4.055555555555555
3648894,5,B001IJO5BW,"If you have just been watching this on Adult Swim, you don't know what you're missing!  A number of hilarious scenes had been cut for the US broadcast, but thankfully they are still on the DVDs.",1255132800,2,194,4.388888888888889
3648895,5,B001IJO5BW,"I downloaded all three seasons from iTunes, after getting addicted to this show on Adult Swim.  The iTunes versions have extra scenes which are even more funny and weird.
From the Crack Fox to the brilliant crimping, this is the most genius show out there at the moment.  I love the ""homemade"" aspect to the sets as well - keeps it as real as howlin' Jimmy Jefferson.
This is a MUST HAVE in your collection if you like to laugh.
BOOSH - please come back LIVE to the US !!

3648897,5,B001IJO5BW,"I've got all 3 series of The Mighty Boosh and was lucky to have met them in San Diego and in LA recently. Their Live Show is indescribable but the DVD shows don't do the airing of shows currently being shown on Adult Swim (they cut too much out!!).  I cannot wait for this special edition set to arrive. Every true Boosh fan should have this in their Boosh Collection! Once the Collection arrives I can loan my Series 1,2 & 3 to turn more friends and family on to the Boosh.  Can't wait until they return to the US for a LIVE Tour!!  Don't miss getting in on the Boosh Bandwagon.  They're sure to be a HUGE hit for years to come in the States. Incredibly funny and entertaining.  The Extras, Outtakes and music on the DVDs is EPIC!! Long Live the Boosh!",1251676800,28,753,4.201388888888889

3648899,5,B001IJO5BW,I have seen all three season of The Mighty Boosh. My opinion is that Noel Fielding and Julian Barrett are the most innovative writers in British Comedy this decade. Their series is hilariously funny and addictive. I recommend it highly.,1250035200,15,236,4.925
3648900,5,B001IJO5BW,"If you can watch it, this set is totally worth it!!!  Adult swim shows these episodes all out of order and 5 minutes or more editted out of each episode on TV. Along with all the bonus features in disc, you get a small sheet of boosh stickers, neat!  I also recommend ""Spaced"" and ""The IT Crowd"" if you're looking for some hilarious British sitcoms. (Though nothing measures up to the wackiness and catchiness of this show.)

If you're in the U.S. as we are, take note that these are Region 2 discs. You can pick up a region-free player (plays discs from all regions) for around $50 here on Amazon.",1241481600,,343,4.4603174603174605
