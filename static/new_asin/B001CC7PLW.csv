3507627,4,B001CC7PLW,"MOONTIDE was Jean Gabin's Hollywood debut. It's a nicely-paced noir about a longshoreman who, when sobered up after a drinking binge, fears he may have killed a man. To keep a low profile, the dockworker takes a job on an isolated bait barge, but love comes to him unexpectedly in the form of a woman trying to drown herself.

Actress Ida Lupino (Anna) was also a successful director.

Thomas Mitchell (Tiny) originated on stage a role later played by Peter Falk on TV-- Lt. Columbo.

Claude Rains' (Nutsy) natural accent was the English dialect known as Cockney.

3507628,5,B001CC7PLW,"My first introduction to the great French movie star Jean Gabin came not from his French classics like ""Grand Illusion"" and ""Pepe Le Moko,"" but from this incredible, haunting overlooked gem -- one of the great lost classics of the 1940s -- which, thanks to Fox DVD, is no longer lost!

1942's ""Moontide,"" one of only two American-made/English-language films in which Gabin ever appeared, is not only one of the most powerful and absorbing Films Noir you'll ever see in your life, but it's brilliantly made, as well:  While the credited director of the film is Archie Mayo, Fritz Lang (""Metropolis"") directed a handful of sequences, and Salvador Dali even contributed a great, surreal ""drunk"" sequence.  The chemistry between Gabin and Ida Lupino is electric and, indeed, I can't speak highly enough about ""Moontide,"" a film which will stay with you long after the final credits have ended.  I'm excited that it has finally merited a DVD release, here in the US.

A lot of people don't understand that noir flicks are not nearly as good as they could have been because censors forced the studios to sanitize their films to suit their anal often hypocritical morals and opinions of how things should be. In spite of all that this flick is still quite good and has some very interesting elements such as A Salvador Dali dream sequence and other oddities.

3507638,5,B001CC7PLW,"Moontide is a strange and great film from 1942 that the world forgot. The mood and atmosphere of Moontide are most interesting, and the viewer will find it to be a dark story with some excellent characters. It's hard to think of another film to compare it to. It's a film that the studio put a lot of resources into producing, even though so many factors were threatening Moontide's survival (Fritz Lang quitting, Pearl Harbor happening, Jean Gabin being mostly unknown in the U.S.)

It's certainly worth watching for any one who enjoys films of the 40's. However, Moontide is not really a ""Film Noir"". For one thing, it preceeded many of the most famous Film Noirs by a few years. Second, the story doesn't exactly live in the Film Noir realm (no private detective, no Femme Fatale, no insurance fraud). And lastly, Moontide isn't meant to be a Film Noir. It's being marketed as such because of the more recent popularity of anything ""Film Noir"". But, Moontide is an excellent film regardless.

PS - The cover image on this Amazon page shows the tagline ""There's Fear In The Night!"". However, the copy we received shows the tagline ""Romance, Blackmail and Betrayal On The Waterfront!"". The rest of the cover art is the same. But we expected ""Fear In The Night!"". We also thought that there was an airplane below it.

3507640,4,B001CC7PLW,"There are a million ways, a million ways cinematically and maybe in life too, that boy meets girl, crime noir or not. Even if that ""boy"" is a not so young drifter sailor, Bobo (played by Jean Gabin last seen by this reviewer in the incredible French film, Max Ophuls' Children of Paradise), whose been around, and thinks he wants to  stay been around. Except fastened to the California waterfront like glue by his profession he is called upon to save a damsel in distress. A young woman, Anna, who serves them off the arm in some hash house (played here by Ida Lupino last seen by this reviewer in High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart and Pard) who was, at wits end for some unknown reason, sets out to drown herself. Naturally sea-worthy Gabin saves her, and the romance is on.

But wait a minute this is a crime noir as well as a boy meets girl story. And Bobo is set up to fit the frame while he was drunk by his friend Tiny, a serious ne'er do well and slightly psycho, after Tiny has killed a denizen of the waterfront over some trivial matter. So the boy meets girls setting up house (on a barge of course out on the breakwater) part keeps on getting set back by the Bobo frame-up part. All, by the way, done in high 1940s melodramatic style.

But there is more. This film's script is filled with little philosophical reflections by one and all, Bobo most of all. For Bobo about leaving the high seas adventure life and its down time waterfront dive existence and settling down. By Anna about whether she is ""worthy"" to be Bobo bride and find happiness in their cozy little barge by the breakwater. By other characters like Doc (a boat owner) and the night watchman, Nutsy (played by Claude Rains). Hell, even Tiny makes a pitch that he just needs a new life up north to break out of his psycho ways. Like I said very melodramatic but as always with Gabin you get some incredibly expressive acting and Ms. Lupino does her misspent working class unworthiness existence whine to a tee.",1321142400,2,1985,4.432876712328767

This was French superstar Jean Gabin's American film debut. He made only one more  film in America that was even less successful than this one before he returned to France for good in 1944.

Strange casting of Claude Rains, against type, doesn't fly.

I didn't buy the chemistry between Gabin and his co-star Ida Lupino. The story is dreamy, unrealistic and overly romaticized and it just doesn't gel.

3507650,5,B001CC7PLW,"Moontide is a very dark, very romantic, deliberately ""artificial"" film noir, essentially shot in studio lots. Gabin is really brillant, sometimes acting like one of the later method actors (eg. Paul Newman), with his never quiet hands, body and this french accent. Ida Lupino is typecast as an outcast, but no one can play such roles better than her (you can't believe that she only came in because Joan Bennett got pregnant). The supporting cast is excellent, you will find Thomas Mitchell as the villain (totally cast agains type, but brillant), and last but not least Claude Rains as a ""street philosopher"", commentator and good friend of Bobo the sailor (Gabin) and later Anna, his girlfried (Lupino). Good technical quality, good extras.

Nacht im Hafen (1942)
Nachtgestalten im Niemandsland, 29. Mai 2010

*** Dieser Kommentar kann Spielverderber enthalten ***

Es war einmal ein Seemann, der hie Bobo und hatte nichts als seinen Seesack und seinen Hund... Es war einmal ein Mdchen, das hie Anna und wollte nicht mehr leben... Es war einmal ein Mann, der hie Nutsy und wachte des Nachts ber die Gestrandeten, dass sie nicht zu Verlorenen werden. Es war einmal ein Mann, der hie Tiny, der folgte Bobo auf Schritt und Tritt und ward bse, als Bobo Anna liebgewonnen hatte und ihn verlassen wollte... Willkommen im sehr knstlichen, poetischen, wie ein film noir fotografierten ""Moontide"", der ein moderneres Mrchen ist. Die Namen sind - siehe oben - entweder sprechend (Nutsy, der ""weise Narr"", der ganz und gar nicht niedliche ""Tiny"", eher ein emotionales Riesenbaby) oder bestehen aus den einfachsten Kinder-Lauten (Bo-bo, An-na). Nachnamen gibt es nicht, im Falle von Anna und Nutsy auch keine Backstorys. Warum Anna sich ertrnken will, wird nie geklrt, der oft betrunkene Bobo tut aber ein Mal im Leben instinktiv das Richtige und holt sie aus dem Wasser. Von da an ist Anna einfach da. Der Film spielt in einer abgeschlossenen, auf wenige Orte beschrnkten Welt am Hafen. Ob Anna einen Mann, festen Freund, Familie oder Freunde hat, wird nie gesagt. Sie mchte sich zwar wieder ""auf den Weg"" machen, aber wir erfahren nie, wohin sie denn gehen knnte. Folglich kommt sie zu Bobo zurck, der nach durchzechter Nacht in einer kleinen Holzhtte aufgewacht ist und dort fr einen Chinesen Kder verkaufen und wohnen darf. Indem ""Moontide"" Menschen auf ihre nackte Prsenz zurckwirft und dabei zuguckt, ob sie aus dem Nichts eine Zukunft schmieden knnen, bekommt er eine elementare Kraft. Er ist ganz auf die wesentlichen Fragen des Lebens reduziert, auch in einer Kunstwelt, in die Menschen hineingeworfen werden, ""einen Platz zu finden"". Dabei kann auch eine Htte mit einem Schild ""live bait"" ein Heim werden. Und ein wilder Auenseiterhaufen ein Mikrokosmos der Gesellschaft. Anna ist (obwohl sie ""schon manches erlebt haben wird"") die Jungfrau, die nackt in diese Gesellschaft geworfen wird und ausgerechnet in Bobo ihren Prinzen findet. Die schbige Htte ist das Schloss. Tiny ist die bse Schwiegermama Bobos, die ihn nicht freigeben will und auch vor Grausamkeiten nicht zurckschreckt (der Film leistet sich hier fr 1942 ungewhnliche homoerotische Anspielungen). Nutsy ist eine Art Gott der kleinen Leute, der nach eigenem Bekunden nie schlafen muss, von dem wir genauso wenig wie von Anna erfahren, ob er ein Leben jenseits des Hafens hat, und der als Gossenphilosoph ber das Geschehen wacht sowie gelegentlich unaufdringlich und weise in es eingreift. Dies alles fhrt zu einer bewusst ""einfach"" gehaltenen Geschichte, die aber gerade deshalb eine poetische Ur-Kraft entfalten kann, die sehr berhrt. Daneben gibt es eine Krimi-Handlung. Bobo soll im Vollrausch einen Mann erwrgt haben, was ihm Leid tte - aber er wei schon, dass er gelegentlich zu unkontrollierter Brutalitt fhig ist. Tiny scheint ein Geheimnis aus Bobos Vergangenheit zu kennen, mit dem er ihn an sich binden kann. Dies alles ist mit Liebe zum Detail inszeniert - wie Bobo am Ende mit Tiny abrechnet, ist eine meisterhafte Choreographie aus Schritten, Gesten und Blicken. berhaupt, Blicke, man muss einmal auf die Schauspieler zu sprechen kommen: Jean Gabin als Bobo ist eine umwerfende Vorwegnahme guter Method Actors (auch wenn er sich vermutlich viel weniger dafr anstrengen musste). Jede Handbewegung sitzt punktgenau mit einer lssigen Nonchalance, wenn er zu Beginn seine Drinks ordert und anschlieend ohne groen Aufwand - obwohl angetrunken - einen strker wirkenden Seemann niederschlgt, aber ihm dann kumpelhaft aufhilft, weil er es schtzt, dass der andere wenigstens versucht hat, fr sein Mdchen zu kmpfen. Spter kann Gabin aber auch mit stummen Blicken alles sagen, wenn er etwa in Gesellschaft einer Hafennutte in die Kamera blickt und feststellt, dass das nicht alles in seinem Leben sein kann. Oder wenn er in Annas Scho versinkt und damit einrumt, auch einmal jemanden zu brauchen. Ida Lupino ist Anna in einer ihrer vielen Outcast-Rollen, bei der man sich gar nicht vorstellen kann, dass sie eine Ersatz-Besetzung war (Joan Bennett war schwanger geworden). Thomas Mitchell als Tiny ist gefhlte 100 kg unterdrckte Wut, Homosexualitt und kaum zu bndigender Frust, ein berzeugender Antipathietrger und brutaler Widerling, dem man aber auch das Tragische dahinter ansieht. Claude Rains ist der uerlich zunchst kaum wiederzuerkennende, etwas schrullig gekleidete Nutsy, dem man schon der markanten Stimme wegen seine Rolle als weiser Herr ber die Geschicke der kleinen Leute abnimmt. Auffllig ist ferner, dass der Film eine Reihe origineller Skurrilitten aufweist, die dem Jahr 1942 voraus waren. Tiny verdrischt Nutsy in einer Art s/m-Szene unter der Dusche mit dem Handtuch. Bobo schenkt Anna zur Hochzeit ausgerechnet das gebrauchte, auf etwas eindeutige Art aufreizende Kleid der Hafennutte (und wir empfinden das keine Sekunde als geschmacklos - die Barschaft ist begrenzt, und lngst haben wir akzeptiert, dass man auch zum Einkaufen aus dieser geschlossenen Welt nicht herauskann). Bobo hilft ab und an einem Arzt, dessen Motorboot zu reparieren - obwohl fr die Handlung unwichtig, wird darauf hingewiesen, dass dessen schne Begleitung nicht des verheirateten Arztes Frau ist und seine Geliebte schon jetzt genervt ist, dass sich der Mann als Mchtegernseebr entpuppt. Auerhalb des Mikrokosmos ist die Welt auch nicht in Ordnung. Aber in ""Moontide"" den Menschen dabei zuzusehen, wie sie mit der ihren fertig werden, ist ein ungewhnliches, poetisches und spannendes Filmerlebnis.",1234569600,3,6552,5.34593023255814
3507651,4,B001CC7PLW,"I've been working hard for years to get my hands on every one of Jean Gabin's films still available in the US. I was pleased to finally see Moontide, his first American film. It's a strange little movie, with both predictable or sentimental touches (the doctor and his girlfriend, the bar girl who really does like Gabin), and some standout twists (the Dali-esque nightmare sequence, Claude Rains as the likeable pal Nutsy whose depth of understanding is head and shoulders above everybody else's [check out that weird speech to Ida Lupino when she's wearing that hot B-girl costume!], the two Chinese -Americans who employ Gabin at their bait shack and truly become part of his small circle of friends, the desperate yet adorable Ida Lupino, and the gut-churning fog and atmospherics of the fishing town). But this is Gabin's film. Although Moontide isn't really a major motion picture, he makes it far better than it should be. His face has a way of portraying Bobo's inner demons, and the surface cheerfulness hides a load of insecurities and fear. I finally converted my sister into a Gabin fan: she was won over by his charisma as demonstrated in a small but masterful gesture - motioning with his fingers for more money from his friend Tiny in the opening bar sequence. After you see Moontide, check out his French films of the same era (I particularly love the pain of Le Jour Se Leve (Daybreak). To see Gabin is to love him.",1233532800,,1432,4.732

3507653,5,B001CC7PLW,"For those who like their film noirs earthy and raw, this one's a gem. French screen idol Jean Gabin turns in a fine, multi-textured performance as a dissolute, drunken French sailor, drinking his way up the coastline of California, who is waylaid by love, in the person of an equally hard-bitten Ida Lupino. They were made for each other, but their domestic bliss is soon threatened by the possibility that Gabin's character may be a bit darker and more violent than we'd previously imagined. There are several great character actors here, but the real doozy of a role is that of Thomas Mitchell, who is perhaps best remembered as the doddering Uncle Bill Bailey in Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" and who is quite a bit more sinister here.  This flick is pretty rough and raw, and definitely worth checking out!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1226966400,4,859,4.797297297297297
3507654,5,B001CC7PLW,"A lovely, lyrical film about the power of the ties that bind us. I see that it was nominated for an Oscar for cinematography, and it definitely shows.

Bobo (Jean Gabin) is a world traveler, a longshoreman who typically comes in to town and leaves with the tide. He is, unfortunately, a very strong man and a bit of a capricious drinker. Due to these tendencies, he has picked up a ramora fish who is unwilling to let go of his meal ticket. When Bobo goes on a bender and an old man ends up dead, the ramora (""Tiny"" played by Thomas Mitchell) tucks this nugget into his nasty little pocket to use against Bobo when the time comes. The time comes in the form of lovely frail Anna (Ida Lupino), saved from drowning. Claude Rains shows up as the conscience and soul of the whole affair. ""Nutsy"" never sleeps (""Not since 1936. Or was it 1937?"") maybe because he doesn't want to miss a second of the gorgeous love story unfolding in front of him.

The early drunk scene is truly odd and revelatory. I said to the King of Noirs ""looks like German Expressionism"". Little did I know how right that was, as Fritz Lang was replaced as the director. That makes sense with the inclusion of both Claude Rains and Jean Gabin...the whole thing rolls like a gently psychedelic germano-french new wave Noir.

Ida is lovely and the performances are first rate all around. The allegory of the sea wall, with the giant anchors along the top, should be inducing film school theses galore. Excellent. Highly recommended.",1225670400,6,1498,4.54074074074074
3507655,5,B001CC7PLW,"Moontide is marvelous!
A must for ""Noir"" fans.
The commentary is particularly fascinating.",1224115200,,90,6.0
3507656,4,B001CC7PLW,"One thing this film does feature is fine acting. From the supporting actors to the lead stars the performances in this picture are stellar. Jerome Cowan, a character actor whose film credits read like a list of 'who's who' is in top form as the doctor whose chance encounter with the principle characters proves to be life changing. Robin Raymond turns in a solid portrayal of a dance hall hustler. Even Victor Sen Yung in a role that could have played as nothing more than a stereotype is believable as the bait pedlar who more or less adopts the film's leads. Claude Rains is wonderfully empathic as the picture's resident philosopher.

But it's the principles who really shine. Ida Lupino combines a nice mixture of vulnerability and street-wise toughness to form the basis of the troubled 'Anna'. Jean Gabin, in one of his rare North American films, is fabulous. This man comes across as rough and crude, but also sweet and kind. There's never a moment when he isn't believable. Thomas Mitchell comes close to stealing the show. And if it weren't for the calibre of the performances around him, he probably would have. He is magnificent in what proves to be a rare turn as a complete heel who steps away from but never quite loses his humanity.

The cinematography by Charles G. Clarke makes excellent use of the lines the sets provide him with. The film's score (by David Buttolph and Cyril J. Mockridge) is compelling and follows the drama well. The lighting (which is uncredited) alternates between darkly atmospheric and warmly radiant according to the demands of the script. And the Directing by Archie Mayo keeps the story moving at a brisk pace. Most importantly he seems to have encouraged the players to take their characters and flesh them out.

The story, from a novel by Willard Robertson, is a good one. Screenwriter John O'Hara apparently had to change it drastically but he did it well. This is a character driven piece in the truest sense of the word. The people it portrays are flawed. Their stories are never less than compelling. They're strong and weak all at once, kind but selfish, driven by greed but never completely greedy. They're the down and out, the lost souls of society, yet as the film reveals, turn out to be anything but lost. They're characters who can be believed and felt for. Even the worst among them never becomes completely unsympathetic.

The one failing of the picture is that the quality of the sets doesn't match the quality of everything else that was done. It's not entirely the fault of the production crew. This was supposed to be a 'location' shoot but the attack on Pearl Harbour rendered the intended place off limits. After that the Studio had to 'make do', which is exactly what they did. The backdrops that depict the 'coastline' look like what they are. The basic designs are good enough but most of them lack depth. Most of the scenes set near the ocean look as if they were filmed in a tank. And the walkway that leads to the barge where Lupino and Gabin reside is close to laughable. Only the sets that were supposed to depict the indoors are any good.

That said, this is a piece that transcends its failings. The characters come across as real people and their drama could be real. The transfer to DVD is good and the extra's, especially the documentary about the making of the film, are good. It loses a star for the shoddy backdrops but this is one to have.",1223164800,6,3424,4.652892561983471
3507657,3,B001CC7PLW,"The two new additions to the Fox Film Noir series are really fun and interesting. Neither could be called strictly noir, but with lots of noirish elements, both films will reward with a first or second viewing. Road House (1948) was dubbed a ""sordid slashing melodrama,"" by one critic, and has Ida Lupino, Cornel Wilde and Richard Widmark in a love triangle dripping with lust, betrayal and violence, as well as Celeste Holm along for the ride. Widmark continues his slightly-off, mostly insane characterizations that started with Kiss Of Death, and Lupino plays a bar canary who warbles Mercer's ""One for My Baby"" with B-girl authority. Moontide (1942) also stars Lupino and is illuminated by the performance of the great French actor Jean Gabin. Deeply moody and atmospheric, with a sense of doom and fate playing over all of the action, the film, set on the docks of a Pacific seaside town, seems like a dream half remembered. Co-starring Jerome Cowan, Claude Rains and Thomas Mitchell, it's a strange---but very compelling---movie.",1222732800,3,1035,5.058479532163743
3507658,4,B001CC7PLW,"Back in 1941, director Archie Mayo (The Petrified Forest, Charley's Aunt, A Night in Casablanca) faced the unenviable task of stepping in to rescue a 20th Century Fox film project called Moontide, which had been abandoned by the great Fritz Lang not too long after shooting had begun. As one of the pioneering German expressionists, Lang was a key developer of the visual style that eventually morphed into a defining noir ""look"" (some of his pre-1940s classics like M, The Testament of Dr. Mabuse and Fury are generally considered seminal proto-noirs). Moontide was also to be the American debut for Frenchman Jean Gabin, already a major star in Europe (Pepe le Moko, The Grand Illusion, La Bete humaine). Needless to say, the pressure was on for Mayo to deliver. And ""deliver"" he did, with this moody and highly stylistic sleeper, ripe for rediscovery.

Gabin stars as Bobo, an itinerate odd-jobber (the type of character Steve Martin might call a ""ramblin' guy"") who blows into a coastal California fishing community with a parasitic sidekick named Tiny (Thomas Mitchell) in tow. Adhering to time-honored longshoreman tradition, Bobo and Tiny make a wharfside pub crawl the first order of business when they hit port. It is quickly established that the handsome, likable and free-spirited Bobo loves to party, as we watch him go merrily careening into an all-night boning and grogging fest. The next morning, Bobo appears to be suffering from a classic blackout, not quite sure why or how he ended up sacked out on an unfamiliar barge, wearing a hat that belongs to a man who has met a mysterious demise sometime during the previous evening. Taking a stroll along the beach in an attempt to clear his head, he happens upon a distraught young woman named Anna (Ida Lupino) who is attempting to drown herself in the surf. Anyone who has screened a noir or two knows what's coming next. Before we know it, Bobo and Anna are playing house in a cozy love shack (well, bait shop, technically). Of course, there is still that certain unresolved matter of Did He Or Didn't He, which provides the requisite dramatic tension for the rest of the narrative.

John O'Hara's screenplay (adapted from Willard Robertson's novel) borders on trite at times and could have done more damage to the film's rep, if it had not been for Gabin and Lupino's formidable charisma, as well as the beautifully atmospheric chiaroscuro photography (by Charles G. Clarke and Lucien Ballard) and assured direction from Mayo. There are several brilliant directorial flourishes; the montage depicting Bobo's fateful night of revelry is a particular standout. The surreal touches in that sequence were ""inspired"" by some original sketches submitted on spec by Salvatore Dali, who was slated to contribute art direction, but ended up dropping out for one reason or another. Great supporting performances abound, particularly from a nearly unrecognizable Claude Rains as a paternal waterfront philosopher who could have easily strolled off the pages of Steinbeck's Cannery Row. Moontide would make an interesting double bill with Clash by Night, another character-driven ""cannery noir"" set in a California fishing town milieu. The Fox DVD sports a great transfer and an insightful commentary track.",1221696000,23,3262,5.095327102803738

8286549,3,B001CC7PLW,"You gotta hand it to Fox for marketing ""Moontide"" as Film Noir. By doing so, they have attracted a much greater audience than might otherwise have given this film a viewing. Made in 1942, the film is a moody and atmospheric set-piece, but not noir.  It stars French superstar Jean Gabin, comparable to Spencer Tracy, an actor of enormous simplicity and range. When Gabin left Europe to escape the Nazis, he turned up in Hollywood, chasing Marlene Dietrich. Fox employed Fritz Lang to direct a film which would recreate the magic Gabin had enjoyed in his French films but there was trouble on the set, Lang was fired and Hollywood journey man Archie Mayo took over. The film works but only just.  It is easy to understand why it was a flop in 1942 when stars like Betty Grable were reaching a peak.

Gabin plays a wastrel who saves waif Ida Lupino from suicide. They fall in love and marry. Along the way, Thomas Mitchell plays Gabin's buddy, Claude Rains an intellectual hobo and Jerome Cowan a wealthy doctor. There are lots of ideas floating around, all curtailed by the censorship of the time but if you follow the subtext, you can fill in the blanks. The film suffers from a stage bound waterfront setting which detracts badly from the reality.  Gabin is an unusual hero with his bloated pudgy features and thick accent but at times, his acting is so real that he stuns. Ida Lupino is her usual tense self and very convincing. The ending is poor.

The print of the film is good and the DVD comes with a really useful documentary which explains the context - the difficulties on the set etc.",1451606400,,1594,4.559440559440559

Too much repeating of lines and too weak a story. Ida Lupino is one of my favorite actresses and even she couldn't carry this boring film.
