1047877,3,6305537801,"Upon second viewing, the flaws in ""A Walk on the Moon"" are even more evident.  A simple, entertaining story set in the Catskills circa 1969, this movie has atmosphere and heart to spare, with two realistic,  convincing performances from Liev Schrieber and Anna Paquin.  What the  movie is sorely lacking is a much-needed scene in which we see what Pearl  finds so irresistible in the Blouse Man.  We see a sexual relationship in  which one substantial conversation never seems to take place.  Because of  this, it is hard to understand her wanting to leave her family for this  man.  Diane Lane's performance is at equal turns strong and unconvincing.  Just check out her response to her husband's discovery of the affair to see  missed opportunities in her emotional range.  Liev Schreiber gives an  Oscar-worthy, subtle performance as Pearl's husband;  Anna Paquin is also  memorable as the daughter.  When all is said and done, the movie smartly  shows us the ramifications of Pearl's actions without resorting to  melodrama.  But by failing to provide us with the basis on which to  evaluate her feelings for the Blouse Man, the movie leaves a gaping hole in  its credibility.  Definitely worth seeing for the performances and overall  feel for the time period.  However, I wish the screenplay had scratched  farther below the surface.",942624000,3,1339,4.995433789954338
1047878,5,6305537801,"I saw this movie in the theater six times and bought the soundtrack - - my ultimate stamp of approval!
The emotions are heartfelt and speak volumes about the real life struggles between mothers and daughters, within  mariages and with one's own self.
The portrait of marriage is the most  compelling in that it gives life to something that often goes unsaid...  things don't have to be bad, love doesn't have to be lost, for there to be  a quiet growing apart and a whispering ""what if"" eating away at  the heart and soul of a relationship.
Likewise, a young mother, and a  teenager daughter reflect many of the same emotions - - wondering what lies  beyond their safe world, wondering how much they can get away with before  they've gone too far - - with the difference being that it is expected of  one and shameful for the other.
A sweet exploration of universal  feelings and questions. I highly reccommend it.",940550400,6,914,4.58641975308642

1047966,5,6305537801,"Pearl (Diane Lane) married Marty (Liev Schreiber) at 19.  He was her first and only.  A summer bungalow in the Catskills seems a perennial booking for the family of 4, plus Marty's mom (Tovah Feldshuh); Marty joining them most weekends. This unpretentious resort is such a richly cultural slice of working-class Jewish Americana in 1969, the summer of the Moon Walk and Woodstock. Activities are announced over the loudspeaker-- Julie Kavner is perfect and priceless at this. Not only recreational pursuits are broadcast, but also opportunities to purchase traditional foods (the knishman is on the premises) and blouses and sundries (that's an oldie but goodie) at reasonable prices. And even a girl's physical coming of age-- yes, naming names-- is proclaimed across the lake and through the pines, with much congratulatory emphasis. When the blouse man (Viggo Mortensen) cometh, he brings fabulous forbidden unannounced offerings, and what happens will produce widespread repercussions. The acting by all is top-notch, including that of Anna Paquin, as the teenage daughter.  The film is smart, amusing, emotional, and just plain really good.  And having the occasional backdrop of the music of Richie Havens is a terrific bonus. Highly recommend.",1489449600,2,1250,5.394871794871795
1047967,5,6305537801,"The story itself would be cliche if not for the perfect casting.  This is a real classic.  Even the background summer noises are natural.
I think this is my favorite movie of all the actors/ actresses in it.  Everyone is in step.  And, yes the main love story is perfect.  However,
each character's reaction to the affair is dead on too.  It really wakes you up to the fact that this encounter alters everyone's lives even though they are not the primary players.  And, the youthful beauty peaks for so many in this movie.  It also gives you an interesting perspective of the American Jewish summer experience.  The story dissects the marriage, the harmonious take on the mother in law relationship, the struggles of a young mom, the choice between romanticism and security.  The latter is something that Viggo likes to incorporate in many of his movies.  Someone always seems to grapple with living freely versus a life of stability  in Viggo's movies.  Which is better?",1488499200,,971,4.77710843373494
1047968,5,6305537801,"I would be hard-pressed to call ""A Walk on the Moon"" a major cinematic achievement, but its story of a restless housewife in a restless time is so charming, sweet-natured and nostalgic and has such a great soundtrack that I love it anyway.

In the mid-1950s, Pearl (Diane Lane) and Marty Kantrowitz (Liev Schreiber) got pregnant as teenagers at a Catskills resort where Pearl was a guest and Marty was working as a waiter. They got married. Instead of going to college and fulfilling his dream to become a scientist, Marty went to work as a TV repairman to support his wife and baby. Pearl was hardly formed enough to have dreams when she got tied down.  Now it's the summer of 1969. As they and thousands of other mostly Jewish working-class families have done every summer, the Katrowitzes load themselves, 14-year-old daughter Allison, her younger brother Danny, Marty's mother Lillian, and most of their worldly possessions into their car and leave their hot cramped apartment in New York City for one of hundreds of Catskills bungalow colonies. But there's something different in the air this summer.

As before, the women and kids enjoy are supposed to be enjoying the fresh air, the lake and the group activities. Marty and the other dads work in the city and drive up to visit their families on weekends. But Pearl has her hands full with Allison, whose burgeoning sexuality, teenager attitude and demands to attend the nearby Woodstock festival with her new boyfriend Ross challenge her at every turn. And Pearl is dealing with her own barely-contained but unarticulated discontent. Lane plays this beautifully, showing subtle traces of irritation and boredom with the gossip of the women over the mah-jongg tiles. The Summer of Love and the early years of the women's movement seem to have left this close-knit community largely untouched.

Various traveling vendors drive routes  through the bungalow colonies hawking ice cream, knishes and other items. Among them is Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen, using his real New York accent), a beautiful long-haired Norse god come to earth to sell cheap blouses off a converted school bus that folds out into a shop. Pearl is drawn to him like iron to a magnet, and they are soon embroiled in a very steamy affair. The love scenes border on fantasy porn, with Walker a straight woman's dream lover. Pearl's mother-in-law is the first to guess what's going on, but soon her whole family knows, and decisions need to be made.

The plot may seem old, but while it's no Anna Karenina, the acting and the details lift this movie out of the Lifetime Channel swamp. Viggo Mortensen can convey more with the way he holds his mouth than most actors can in a month of scenery-chewing. Even though his character is more of a symbol than a fully fleshed out person, he does wonders with it. He gives us a sweet man who truly cares about Pearl and, while he hasn't seen much of the world either, has a rich inner life and unfulfilled dreams of his own. Anna Paquin is all convincing awkwardness as Allison, who wants to push every boundary but still be safe with her family. Liev Schreiber is a saint for taking on the thankless role of doofy, loyal, decent Marty. Tovah Feldshuh, playing older than her age, brings warmth and charm to the slightly kitsch role of the near-psychic mother-in-law. The family activities and dynamics are completely believable, from loading the ironing board into the car, to the songs the family sings on the road, to the way the kids squabble over who will sleep where in the bungalow. Julie Kavner acts as an humorous unseen Greek chorus, making announcements like ""The blouse man is on the premises,"" over the camp loudspeaker. It's fascinating to look into the world of the Catskill bungalow colonies, which have sadly almost all fallen to ruin.  Finally, the music, mostly album tracks rather than hits, is used perfectly even if somewhat anachronistically (a couple of the Grateful Dead songs were from albums not released until after 1969). At the beginning, we hear Bobby Darin and Wayne Newton, then as Pearl moves into her affair with Walker, two gorgeous tracks from Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, ""Today,"" and ""Embryonic Journey,"" and Joni Mitchell's ""Cactus Tree.""  You can see the love and care that went into each frame of this movie. There are no heroes and no villains, just people trying to figure things out as they go along in a time of rapid change.",1488153600,,4451,4.839684625492772

Whoever wrote the script must have been a real city person.  Uh-hummm, --- wasps do not have stingers.  Bees have stingers.  Wasps take a little bite out of you and leave their venom.  You can swell up to about the size of a quarter with a wound that looks like a pink hill with a red dot in the center of it, not a huge red and black boo-boo like is shown in the movie.

Diane Lane gets a lot of praise for her role and deservedly so. But, for my money, the great, underrated Liev Schrieber steals the show. Without getting into the infidelity subplot and ""a woman's awakening"", the scenes where Schrieber discovers his wife's dalliance are heartbreaking and so real, it should be a textbook chapter on great acting.

Just once, just ONCE I want to see a fabulous movie where there is soul-binding attraction between a hunky free spirit & a bored & house-bound wife where the woman says FockItALL and GOES. I know, I know, the kids, the earnest husband, he's such a good man, yadda yadda. First Bridges of Madison County, & now this. I was shrieking by the end of it. PHOCCCKKKKKK. GO already! Men do it all the time, & I think Hollywood considers it ""extra sinful"" for a mom to do it.

Just ONCE. Indulge my fantasy, Someone. Please.

Now that I got that out of my system, I will say that the energy between Mortensen & Lane was just absolutely electric & captured the powerful, desperate attraction & bittersweet longing so, so well.  Incredible performances by ALL.  Every emotion mixed with its powerful opposite.

Another reviewer commented that this was the daughter's coming-of-age story, but I beg to differ. It's the mom's coming-of-age story as well, & the point seems to be that, two kids notwithstanding, she is stuck as the adolescent she was when she became pregnant. Pearl tells Marty that she ""disappeared"" over the course of the marriage, but IMHO it's not that her true self ""disappeared,"" it's that the road to discovering that true self was halted, so it never really appeared in the first place. In this way, emotionally she is in the exact same place as her daughter. She gets to return to that developmental place to get back on the path to self-identity, which Walker facilitates. I think the lesson here is that a coming-of-age can happen at any time in one's life, the corollary to which is, as Tom Robbins says in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood.""",1435104000,2,1779,4.411585365853658
1048291,4,6305537801,"Diane Lane & Viggo Mortensen really brought this story to life.

At times the plausibility was tenuous, but really most of us look for the movies as an escape from the dusty realities of everyday life.

But it wasn't like that back in 1969, I guarantee you that. I watched on live TV as Neil Armstrong took that fateful step onto our sister planet (the moon is really too big to be considered a satellite.)
1969 was something else, something else entirely. The whole world was going insane. Everything was changing. Vietnam was exploding. the ""generation gap"" was on everyone's lips. Woodstock was in the air. Hope and despair wrestled for the soul of my generation, and both won.
A Walk on the Moon captures this time in America's history perfectly, lovingly. Sensual, sweet, humming with a sense of danger, beautifully acted, this movie is one of the forgotten greats.",1428019200,,957,4.771084337349397

Enter Walker Jerome, a handsome blouse salesman who is easy on the eye, and very nice. Alison is Pearl's daughter, who has just turned 14 years old. She is willful and she is a constant reminder to Pearl about how one decision can change your life forever.

Pearl and Walker enter into an affair. He teaches her about life and having fun, however, and Pearl feel's free for the first time in a long time. However, Pearl's husband Marty soon finds out about the affair and confronts her with it.

This movie takes place during two very important events in 1969 - the moon landing and Woodstock and both events play into the movie. The music is fabulous and the story line is one that many a housewife can relate to. I'm not saying that we all jump into affairs, but there have been many things in my life that I wish had gone differently.

He wakes her up to feelings she put aside when she became a young wife and mother.  I won't say much more as you have to see how it all plays out yourself.  It could have been a boring, predictable story, but it's not.  It's about the real ways real life sometimes interferes with our dreams and it's about deciding to want what you have.

1048693,2,6305537801,"Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen are on the DVD cover and they are the only reason to watch this film.  Their charm and beauty together with the lovely title promise a magical story that unfortunately doesn't develop. The script is terribly hackneyed and predictable and it's filled with tiresome cliches.  We've seen this plot over and over. ""Marjorie Morningstar"" did it very well....the Nice, middle-class Jewish girl who was angaged to a Nice, steady boy but then was entranced by an exciting show business type,(""Noel Ehrman"", played by Gene Kelly) but eventually came to her senses and settled down to the Nice doctor. It was interestng back in the 50's but now....not-so-much.

Here we don't have Gene Kelly but we do have Viggo Motensen and that's not bad. As another reviewer wrote, ""Who wouldn't want to go to Woodstock with Viggo Mortenson?""  Poor Pearl (Diane) got pregnant the first time she slept with a boy and was trapped into marriage.  Marty, who wanted to go to college, was trapped and, being a Nice boy, gave that up, just as he gave up his microscope to help out his widowed mother years earlier....gave it all up to hack away in the back of a tv repair shop for the rest of his life.  His name reminds me of another very good 50's movie, starring Ernest Borgnine...another blue collar, dull guy stuck in a boring life somewhere out in the Boroughs.  I think these films have already been made and Mr. Goldwyn should have tried for some new material.  Sprucing it up with the moon walk was a nice try but really didn't work.

I could rant on about poor Pearl's plight...stuck there in this summer camp in the Catskills with two kids and her mother-in-law! Where the most exciting thing that happened was the visit of the Blouse Man.  Her Marty, an archetypal Nice Boy, is too weak to dare to ask for a few days off from work, although a co-worker, the one with sexy wife, gets a whole week off.  And no one could ever imagine Marty standing up to his Mamma.  And just think....just down the road...what's happening but the cultural phenomenon of the Century....Woodstock!

It is a good idea and it could have made a better movie if it hadn't been so mired down in all the cultural cliches and the stultfying sentimentality.  There are a few good scenes....of Diane and Viggo frolicking in the waterfall and at Wookstock.  Viggo looks great in green paint!  I sat through most of it but when Pearl suggested to Marty that they turn up the radio and dance I had to leave!

1048768,5,6305537801,"It was very late Saturday night, I happened to be home alone and very tired, and I wasn't at all sure that I would want to see this movie enough to remain awake past the opening few minutes.  Funny, though, I don't quite know from exactly where I got my second wind (AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF).  I've been on both sides of the main guy parts of this movie at different points in my life, and I've got to tell you that THIS FLICK HITS HOME!!!  Even the atmosphere of the wife on vacation in the mountains with the kids, while the husband has to get back to the city to work-- leaving the wife just lonely and complaining enough to feel vulnerable-- was a reality I experienced in real life, and re-experienced just as realistically while watching this movie.

  The negative reviews threw me off completely--as a movie lover, as a man with a reasonably rich sexual history to look back on, and as a clinician helping others through their own times of crisis (or LACK OF CRISIS when they should be feeling themselves in one).  In both real-life ""perpetrator"" and ""victim"" roles, I was discovering the broader reaches of joy.  I also remember undergoing the encounter with the other man, or with the man when I was the other man.  I remember how hard I struggled for that same sort of respectfulness with which the characters in this movie tried desperately to reach out to each other, and how hard it was to live up to it while I was in such pain . . . or having caused such pain.

  From having been on both sides I learned:
(1) that the ""other man"" is never victorious over the man, because the ""other man"" usually represents only the exclusive freedom of indulged fantasy for the woman; and
(2) that the ""victim"" has to come to the decision to compete with the other man for his woman's affections as a lover, not as a punitive moralistic whiner.
The lover in this movie seems to have known the first part from the git-go; the husband, on the other hand, took a while (and some memory-jogging help from a microscope his wife sent him) to warm up to that second point.  Taming jealousy (the green eyed monster) turns out to be more a matter of taming one's own, as well as everybody else's, INSECURITY.

  Even when it didn't hurt, both sides of the experience were nevertheless scary to go through--and under both circumstances, it was ridden with guilt and uncertainty about where ultimately this would all be going.  I just saw the film for the first time on Netflix, and I have promptly bought six copies for me and to share.  While over half the marriages end in divorce, Americans remain a determinedly marrying and RE-marrying people, leaving a great many of us to make our way in blended family situations.

  These days, couples are bombarded with the hollow promises of fantasy entertainment garnered  from cheap TV melodramas, which invariably leave them hard up to distinguish reality from common yearning.  Just saw on WebMD advice delivered by a supposed sexuality expert about marriage--5 ways to keep sensuality strong--and it seemed like she was cooking Hamburger Helper (in the end, offering more explanations for why we shouldn't expect mutual climax than how to reach it with each other).

  There is a vast mystery in love, which this movie seems to capture (without ever trying to bring it all down to some sort of stupid easy solution by the time the credits start rolling).  In actual point of fact, there are as many different types of love as the Eskimos have words for snow, but we nevertheless think about it as only a unidimensional topic: and that's also how we tend to talk about it, or (worst of all) do it.  It is ultimately more art than science, and one can only be taught to take the time to explore and connect with one's own inner vision for how to go about it.  That is the gift we offer to the other party in any genuinely honest embrace, and thus the conversation is on (hopefully in responsively negotiated back and forth fashion).

  I loved the movie's keen sense of proportions: the wife achieved intense frolicking with her lover, but we leave the husband and wife back together having barely achieved clumsily dancing the twist with one another--which is exactly how new beginning proceed (when we first meet our other, or when we become REacquainted with him or her).  And all this was done so tastefully in the movie, which provides role models which are sure to keep couples caught in similar dilemmas from having to seek feeling excitedly XXX ""dirty"" in order to get it on.

  Hard to believe, but cynical old Hollywood SOMETIMES DOES GET IT RIGHT!!!  Cheap-shots-from-left-field/low-ball criticisms will only set the moguls back on their heels, and back to offering us Pabulum and Silly-Putty versions of life.  When a cultural objet-d'art like this comes along, give it it's due, or shut up and get out of the way.  If we fail to exercise the discipline and generosity to do this, remember that audiences invariably get the crap they deserve.

Diane Lane, the actress that needs no words...because her face tells it all...is superb in this film.  The decisions that she faces during the period in her life that is portrayed are very real and hit close to home with many viewers.

Viggo Mortensen and Liev Schreiber are both also excellent in this movie, but the core of the story really revolves around Diane and the life decisions that she must make.

1049135,4,6305537801,"After I had seen and raved Lane's dynamic performance in `Unfaithful' I was told by many a friend to check out her riveting portrayal of, you guessed it, a cheating spouse in `A Walk on the Moon'.  My friends all claimed that she is just as impressive and just as Oscar worthy here as well, but really, all they had to do was say Diane Lane and I was sold (I just love her).  I don't know how this movie passed me by, but then again, 1999 was such a rich year for film that it is almost impossible to lay claim to seeing all of them.  `A Walk on the Moon' may be a tad predictable (okay, a lot predictable) and it may be formulaic, but the rich performances and the nicely developed script help elevate this film higher than the subject necessarily calls for.

The film tells the story of Pearl Kantrowitz, a young mother of two who is taking the summer vacation with her family to the Catskills.  Her husband Marty can only stay in segments for his profession is in high demand (he is a television repair man) beings that Armstrong is about to land on the moon and everyone and their mother wants to watch it on television.  While Marty is away, Pearl finds herself falling for Parker, a hippie `blouse salesman' who is spellbound by Pearl's good looks and obvious charm.  While Pearl struggles with her own desires she has to try and reel in her fourteen-year-old daughter Alison while avoiding the watchful eye of her mother-in-law Lillian.

`A Walk on the Moon' unfolds rather predictably, with Pearl engaging in an affair, her daughter testing the boundaries of rebellion and her poor husband uncovering the lines of deceit and falling to pieces over it all.  The script does contain some inconsistencies and improbabilities (the whole Woodstock thing, while a nice touch, was a tad unbelievable) but the wonderfully fleshed out performances and the overall honesty of the films conclusion make this a very well done film.

Diane Lane is Oscar worthy as Pearl, such a warmly constructed performance that is almost as brilliant as her `Unfaithful' turn.  In all honesty I can't for the life of me understand who she was Oscar snubbed for Meryl Streep's mediocre turning in `Music of the Heart' or Julianne Moore's overrated and boring turn in `The End of the Affair'.  Lane towers over both of those performances by creating a real woman who is devastated and confused and liberated all at the same time.  Live Schreiber, an actor for whom I am steadily becoming more and more impressed with, is amazing as Marty.  As the film progresses and he uncovers the truth we can feel his emotions crush inward, and the way he goes from one extreme to the next is believable and heartbreaking.  Anna Paquin is sensational as Alison, really matching Lane's ferocity, and Tovah Feldshuh is flawlessly moving as Marty's worrisome mother.  Viggo Mortensen, who has turned himself into a fine actor, is less than engaging here.  I've never seen the physical attraction there, so maybe that's why his character didn't sell me (in my opinion Schreiber is a much better looking man) but overall I found him underwhelming.  He didn't charm me or fascinate me as he should have in order to sell his character.

As a whole I think that `A Walk on the Moon' works very well indeed.  Sure, the script could have been tightened a bit, and Viggo could have been replaced, but almost every other element is right in line with where they should be.  Lane is a revelation (why is she Oscarless?) and Schreiber is flawless.  The honesty that `Unfaithful', the film, lacked (delving into the whole murder-thriller business was a big mistake) `A Walk on the Moon' has in spades.",1222646400,4,3652,4.664586583463339
1049187,4,6305537801,"""A Walk on the Moon"" was one of the best movie I have seen in awhile. Since my purchase of this movie I have watched it 3 times, my husband has watched it with me also and enjoyed it. Normally this is not a type of movie he would watch.",1220400000,,236,3.74
1049188,3,6305537801,"Like some other reviewers here I felt that the title A Walk on the Moon wasn't really suited to the theme of this movie, but that's just my opinion. As for the movie itself, it takes on the theme of adultery, growing pains and family life set against the backdrop of Woodstock and man's landing on the moon.

Diane Lane plays Pearl Kantrowitz who married young [to her high school sweetheart] and her husband is played  by Liev Schreiber, a T.V. repairman. They lead a typical middle-class life with their two children, 14-year-old daughter [Anna Paquin] and a young son. It is the summer of 69 and the Kantrowitz family, including grandma Bubbie[Tovah Feldshuh], head off to the Catskills where they join a bungalow colony of similar working class Jewish people and everything seems idyllic on the surface except for Pearl's dissatisfaction with her humdrum existence [""I haven't made a decision in ten years, except whether to shop at A&P or Waldbaum's""] and things are not helped by her husband's long working hours and absence.

Enter the ""Blouse Man"" aka Walker Jerome [played by pre-LOTR and Eastern Promises Viggo Mortensen] who stirs something primitive and dormant in Pearl and both engage in a summer of forbidden passion. When Pearl's husband eventually finds out, all hell breaks loose, and Pearl  has some tough decisions to make.

I felt that the script itself needed some tweaking as it often felt like a melodrama that seemed to drag in parts. What lifted the movie above melodrama however was the fine cast - Diane Lane's Pearl is well-defined as the bored and jaded housewife seeking some form of self-actualization, even if it takes the form of adultery. Viggo Mortensen brings some depth to the character of the 'other' man, Liev Shreiber does a pretty decent job as the confused and hurt husband, and there are also some other strong supporting roles. Anna Paquin plays an angry adolescent who rages against her parents yet is quite vulnerable, and Tovah Feldshuh deserves special mention as the 'all-seeing' Bubbie who can spot a disaster from miles away.

All in all, this is a pretty decent drama that could have been great if it had a stronger script. The theme of adultery is inadequately dealt with, yet on the whole, it is entertaining and the scenes of Woodstock etc make for a fun watch.",1216598400,2,2317,4.838383838383838
1049189,4,6305537801,A romantic coming of age movie where both mother and daughter grow up during the summer of love.  Fantastic sound track.,1215043200,,120,4.714285714285714
1049190,5,6305537801,"This is a well-made film on every level.  It's great how they tie in the goings-on of 1969 to work with the story.  And it does work incredibly well.  One thing I liked about it is that the performances are realistic  and it doesn't smack of Hollywood.  It left me with more of a tragic feeling than a romantic one.  You can only shake your head over the complexity of the human heart and society that it exists within.  They should have included Crosby, Stills and Nash's ""Find the Cost of Freedom"" in there just for good measure, as this movie certainly explores that.  OK, that song is not really about love affairs and their effect on families but about war..  Still, the effect of the affair on her family (the cost of freedom?) is obviously one of the themes in this movie and is in fact part of the price she (and her family) pays.  For better or for worse.

I wanted to see this after catching Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful"", which was a rollarcoaster ride.  ""A Walk On The Moon"" better fits the drama catagory, and doesn't have the edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting impact of ""Unfaithful"" though it does gently but surely pull you into its world.  Thus we care about the characters and become quite interested in the story.

And yes, it was great to see the legend of Woodstock and the late 60s play into the personal life of one family.  Neither over nor under-done, the final effect is a beleivable and involving movie that didn't exactly have me yearning for those times, but certainly gives a sense of appreciation and understanding for where people were.  While styles and current events have changed, issues of the heart perhaps haven't changed all that much.  The hippie revolution seemed to test those issues (among others), adding another interesting element as backdrop to this ancient dilemma.",1208822400,,1806,4.682539682539683

1049306,4,6305537801,"This tender film revisits the Summer of Woodstock (1969), as well as a slice of New York Jewish life from that era (the family summers in bungalow colonies in upstate New York).  If you lived through the Sixties as a teen, just the background music may make you weep.  Diane Lane is genuine and affecting as Pearl Kantlowitz, a Bronx housewife who married and had children too young, and at 32 is wondering if this is all life will ever hold for her.  Pearl is going through a bad patch, exacerbated by seeing societal changes and possibilities erupting around her.  Her rebellious 14-year-old-daughter, newly menstrual and blossoming sexually, is also going through a bad patch, which doesn't help matters, especially as Pearl can see that her daughter will likely have wider horizons than she herself did.  Pearl's loving, but somewhat stolid husband, Marty, sympathetically played by Liev Schreiber, is either unable or unwilling to address her increasingly urgent needs.  He too is trapped by their humdrum lives and early parenthood.  As was typical of the era, husbands went back to the city during the week and came back on the weekend, and wives were left alone during the week to play mah-jong and cards, look after youngsters, and spend hours at the lakeside.  This existence only throws Pearl's restless questioning into sharper relief.

Into this volatile emotional atmosphere steps a bohemian peddler called ""The Blouse Man"" (the film's original title), also sympathetically played by Viggo Mortensen.  The Blouse Man (who actually has a name, Walker Jerome) visits the bungalow colony periodically, selling clothing and odds and ends to the women out of his bus.  Walker's character could easily have degenerated into a sleazy drifter taking advantage of a disaffected housewife.  Mortensen gives Walker gentle dimension - he is truly attracted to Pearl and falls in love with her, he is intelligent, and he honestly believes in the values of the emergent counterculture - he has lost a brother in Vietnam and has reasons for distrusting the establishment.  Walker is very much the ""other"" - a kind of Golden Shaygetz (gentile man in Yiddish), blonde and extraordinarily handsome, who couldn't present more of a contrast to Pearl's nice but dull Jewish husband.  Mortensen handles this role with sensitivity - he does not pursue Pearl, it is she who makes the first move toward him, and he leaves her to set the pace of the affair.  The scene in which Walker and Pearl first have sex in the back of his bus is both erotic and touching.

Complicating matters is the presence of Pearl's mother-in-law, who lives with the family, but with whom Pearl has an affectionate, not adversarial relationship.  Played by Tovah Feldshuh, the mother-in-law (something of a local psychic who gives card- and tea-leaf readings) discerns the relationship between Pearl and Walker, and reveals it to Marty during the week by telephone, telling him to ""get your tuchas up here no matter what you gotta do"".  Whether she was right to interfere, the individual viewer may decide, but she precipitates a crisis in which Pearl and Marty must make decisions about their lives.

Some may find the tie-up here a bit too pat - but this really is a charming film, well-produced with attention to period detail, including the music (e.g., Richie Havens, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Janis Joplin).  You can tell that the writers felt real affection for the characters, exposing their foibles and errors in a detached yet humane way.  The ensemble work is fine, and that includes the children, especially Anna Paquin as Allison, the sullen teenager.  This is a quality film, worth repeat viewings and with many quietly memorable moments.",1200355200,,3741,5.038961038961039

The reason is abundantly clear during the opening credits. The jagged edges in the credit text, visible on a 19"" CRT, leave one wincing at a bad viewing experience about to be had. A viewing on any PC software such as PowerDVD reveals why this disc is so hard to look at.

1049312,5,6305537801,"I get an emotional kick out of A Walk on the Moon, its double-entendre title aside.  For me, the DVD is a winner for three reasons: 1) Viggo Mortensen plays a romantic (OK, lusty) leading man; 2) Diane Lane does her unfaithful best three years before her Academy Award-winning turn opposite Richard Gere in Unfaithful; and 3) I get to experience, albeit vicariously, a smidgen of the goings-on at summertime resorts in the Catskills. Let me work my way backward. ...

As a tween living on the East Coast in the mid-'70s, I recall my cousins' families and mine driving upstate to Sullivan County, New York, several weekends out of every summer.  Destination: Great big country house a la The Waltons. With my cousins and I belting out every lyric to sunny songs such as The Captain and Tennille's ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" and Elton John's ""Philadelphia Freedom"" as their melodies bounced around the car and out of the open windows, life felt as if it could not get any better. Approaching the Catskills, we would read aloud the colorful billboards announcing the different summer resorts. One time I got up the nerve to ask the adults in the car why we never went to any of those resorts and was told matter-of-factly that we would not be accepted there. So as I got older, I always fantasized that the Catskills resorts had to be boatloads of fun to be so exclusive and all.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Dancing-20th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000NIVJHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition)</a>, while fictional, definitely gave me a glimpse into the exciting lifestyle behind those wonderful billboards. All of this to say that when watching A Walk on the Moon, I feel like an outsider looking into a life I never had the privilege to enjoy. ...

A Walk on the Moon also has many cinematic elements in its favor: breathtaking cinematography, a painstaking attention to time and place, and authentic regional dialects and vernacular.  For those viewers who perceive the film's pacing as long and drawn-out, I challenge them with this paradigm shift: Think of the slow pacing as a metaphor for lust's fever running its course amid summer's sweltering heat. ...

Diane Lane is a force to be reckoned with when she portrays a character whose marriage just isn't working out. A Walk on the Moon predated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfaithful-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00006RCNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfaithful (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;by three years, so we viewers get a chance to see how she has perfected acting out the visceral female erotic response that perhaps many women envy. That pivotal scene at the rear of the bus, in which she and the Blouse Man seem totally oblivious to a major milestone in world history -- hence, the film's title -- is no less intense than the scene in Unfaithful when she is on the train reminiscing about quivering beneath (hunka-hunka-burnin'-love luscious) Olivier Martinez hours earlier. Watching her squirming in her seat on that train, as she alternates between bliss and angst, I felt as if I had experienced the affair! In fact, I have had to hit the Pause button on the remote, leave the room and ice down my forehead.

Lane knows how to embody a free spirit, whether in Unfaithful, in which her character double-crosses her attorney husband -- who ironically stakes his career on loyalty -- in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Tuscan-Sun-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0000VD02Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition)</a>, where American divorcee meets Fellini's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Dolce-Vita-Deluxe-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000AYNFWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Dolce Vita (Deluxe Collector's Edition)</a>, or here, in A Walk on the Moon. ...

Lastly, the No. 1 reason I love A Walk on the Moon is Viggo Mortensen in the role of the Blouse Man. His gaze alone is intense. He possesses a certain je ne sais quoi, an erotically hypnotic, intangible quality that actors such as Clark Gable, Marlon Brando and Steve McQueen translated very well on screen.  Serving as brilliant contemporary examples would be Robert DeNiro, Idris Elba and Clive Owen.  Oh, and Daniel Sunjata (oh, sing a joyous, sweet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noel/dp/B000AAF27G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noel</a>). Female actors who also have that seductive quality include Kathleen Turner and Faye Dunaway as past examples; Jessica Lange, Angelina Jolie and Vivica Fox as current examples.

I distinctly remember road trips in my family's avocado green station wagon to scenic destinations in the Smokey Mountains.  We've rented many cabins and stayed occupied for hours with simple activities, long before sophisticated entertainment crept in.  This movie unfolds in a dynamic time when the age of discovery/peace movement challenged conservative lifestyles.  Pearl (Diane Lane) is looking for something more than the ""good mother"" role she is trapped in.  Like so many women who marry young and bear children, she has been a wife and mother for what seems like a life time (married at 17), fulfilling the needs of her husband and children.  The lure of fantasy and excitement are too much to overcome and she is drawn in by the free wheeling, happy go lucky character played by Viggo Mortensen.  Lucky for her that she could experience some of the things that she completely missed out on, and still keep her family together.  I like the way the movie ends because Pearl returns to her husband with a better appreciate for life and her husband has a better appreciate for what Pearl has sacrificed to raise their family.

Perhaps this is a difference in cultures, I'm not sure, but as an Australian I found this movie to be sickeningly Disneyesque in its portrayals.  Not worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of your time over - even for Viggo.",1147132800,5,598,4.701923076923077
1049419,5,6305537801,"This is among the most underrated films I have ever seen.  The characters, the casting, the subplots, Tony Goldwyn's superb directing, I simply cannot say enough about this film.  Diane Lane was superb as a young wife and mother whose youth came to a halt when she becomes pregnant at 17 and she later has another child after her daughter.  Lane's character Pearl is an adventurer and a free spirit who is married to a good man who is, alas, unbelievably conventional, uptight, boring, and so unromantic I found myself wincing several times throughout the movie.  The scene where he confronts Pearl about the Blouse Man is so lackluster I was thinking, ""Yeah this guy seems REALLY upset"".

  And speaking of the Blouse Man.....As far as I am concerned Viggo Mortensen is the most devine man who ever graced this planet.  He is already overwhelming as an artist and an activist, but when one adds his superb acting abilities to the list he is almost unbearable.  Mortensen's role of Jerome Walker is among his best performances and by far his most sensual.  The moment Pearl meets Walker the attraction is tangible as she looks at him and sees everything she wants and everything she wanted to be.  Her affair with Walker gives her back the things that were taken away from her when she became a wife and mother.

  Mortensen is beyond temptation knocking on Pearl's door.  The way he moves, holds himself, and looks at every woman who comes into his bus is seduction itself.  He takes one look at Pearl and knows what this woman has lost and what she needs to regain the part of herself she has sacrificed.  From the moment he bites the tag off the tie-dye shirt he gives to her (one of the sexiest moves you have ever seen) you cheer for this gorgeous couple and wish that Pearl was free in order to live her dreams with this sublime man.  The love scenes in this film are beautifully done and practically set the screen on fire as Pearl abandons her barely-there inhibitions with a very obliging Walker.

  Perhaps the most intense scene in the movie is when Pearl's son is injured while Pearl is with Walker.  As they are pulling back up to the summer commune Pearl is accosted by her fellow housewives to tend to her her injured child.  As she and Walker rush to the boy's side, it is Walker (much to the dismay of Pearl's mother-in-law) who knows how to tend to the wounds and comfort the boy.  After her son is treated Pearl's husband rushes into the house and the three parties of the love triangle are in the same room.  Your heart breaks for Pearl as her anguish is written all over her face and when her husband turns to Walker and thanks him for assisting their son, you don't hurt for her you hurt with her.  It is a gut-wrenching scene that is so visual it is almost more stirring when you mute the audio.  The runner-up as the most poignant moment in this film is when Pearl's daughter watches her through a pair of binoculars at Woodstock.  Busted is the understatement of the millennium for that discovery.  Even so, Pearl looks absolutely beautiful in her joy and freedom as Walker swings her around in his arms.  Once more, Viggo Mortensen, in a low-slung pair of tight pants, no shirt, and artfully painted as he lowers Diane down and slinkily crawls on top of her.....On a lighter note, I would be thinking ""Good job Mom!""

  The ending is happy and a bummer at the same time.  I'm not going to give it away but I thought Pearl would make a different choice than what she did.  When you watch the scene with Pearl and Walker in his room you will understand what I mean.  It is in that moment Viggo Mortensen shows us what a truly superb actor he  is with naked emotion in his face, voice, and eyes.  If you loved The Bridges of Madison County, you will love a Walk on the Moon.  If you are a fan of any of the actors in this film you will love it.  If you are a Viggo fan you will need something cold to drink and if you just want to see a great movie this will certainly leave you satisfied.

It is a pivotal point for the main characters in this gentle movie. The main review states ""Although its tale of marital crisis unfolds a bit too cleanly...""  You know, I don't find it difficult to believe that there are some people left in America that are able to go beyond a crisis and find a way to reach out and hold on....that not everyone thinks a talk show or reality show way of handling life is the only way.

As one who lived as a young adult in 1969, I could see through the eyes of each character. Excellent acting and storyline. Kudos to the writer and director.

The movie made me mad, sad, and glad, bringing out all three different emotions. At times in our lives, we all are tempted to be someone we're not; and to do things we would not when our emotions get in the way. If we're mad we do one thing; if we're disappointed with life, we may take a selfish turn and do something ordinarily unthinkable, which is what happened with the character Pearl.

This movie portrays very well the emotions of daughter against mother, the emotions of this young teen experiencing the entry into womanhood, the emotions of a father and husband toward his family and his sacrifices for such. The emotions of a family unit seen in 1969 is no different than any family today.

I loved the movie. I would definately have it in my movie library. I give it two thumbs up! (By the way, the 'F' word was not used in 1969, as this movie indicates. This word is put into movies by the generation who DOES use it, thinking it has always been accepted - NOT.)

Others have found it ""slow"" or ""unconvincing."" I didn't. Though I do wish we could have seen more of the relationship between Walker and Pearl (not just the sex), you sensed that they did connect in ways other than the physical.

The most poignant moment of movie for me is when Pearl visits Walker at his house. She sees the maps on the walls of his bedroom and asks if he's been to all of these places. He seems sad, and a bit embarrassed, as he says ""no."" They seemed like kindred spirits in that moment; both longing for a life bigger and more exciting that what they had known. Perhaps that's what she saw in him (besides the fact that he's stunning and sexy).

1049517,3,6305537801,"The Kantrowitz family is heading to at retreat in the Catskills for the 4th of July in the summer of 1969. Marty (Liev Schreiber), who works in a television repair shop, is going to have to go back to work because Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are going to be walking on the moon later that month and everybody and their uncle wants to make sure they can see the big moment on their television. That means his wife, Pearl (Diane Lane), and mother, Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh, in another fine turn as a Jewish mother almost as good as her exquisite portrayal in ""Kissing Jessica Stein""), will stay at the bungalow watching over the kids, Alison (Anna Paquin) and Daniel (Bobby). Alison ""becomes a woman,"" a fact cheerfully announced over the public address system (by Julie Kavner), and goes off in search of her first kiss, her first date, and her first leaving the house to go attend a three day festival of rock music. But Alison is not the only one looking for trouble.

We learn later in ""Walk on the Moon"" that the first time Pearl and Marty made love when they were teenagers, Pearl got pregnant with Alison. Marty was going to go to college, but that dream ended and he got married and went to work. Now it is fourteen years later and when Pearl sees her daughter running off to have fun and then notices that the ""Blouse Man"" (Viggo Mortensen), announced that way when he arrives to sell blouses out of a converted bus, is noticing her, she becomes painfully aware that she has only been with one man in her entire life. Now her husband is away, and while the rest of the world is watching images being beamed back from the moon, Pearl takes her own giant leap.

The ""Blouse Man"" is really named Walker Jerome, a name, it is pointed out, that is backwards. But that hardly matters because he is, as you can plainly see, played by Viggo Mortensen, and that means Marty is going to need some help. At least he has the love and support of his mother, who makes it clear that no matter how bad the traffic is between the city and the Catskills because of the concert at Woodstock, Marty needs to get back up to the bungalow (the time it takes Marty to get from the city to the bungalow is mentioned every time he shows up). Eventually Pearl will discover that while she can run off to Woodstock or a secluded waterfall for her fun with her new lover, the world in which she lives not only has a moon on which men have walked, but a husband, a daughter, and a son. She also finds that not only does she have to explain her infidelity to those who have a right to know, but her marriage as well.

The moment of crisis in ""A Walk on the Moon"" has to do with Pearl's decision as to what she will now do with the rest of her life. Does she attempt to reconcile with her angry husband or does she live the life she never had with the new guy? My problem is not with Pearl's choice, but rather the idea that changing the music that you listen to can make everything better. I might be willing to buy that deus ex musica if it did not work so quickly, although this 1999 film has a pretty good soundtrack that features Judy Collins singing ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes?"" (for rather obvious reasons given the plot). But I end up rounding down on this one because while the script by Pamela Gray (""Music of the Heart"") finely defines the female characters and their motivations, I find Marty's actions to be motivated more by the requirements of the resolution than anything else. Given the story, this one needed to have more than Lane and Mortensen frollicing in the water, as visually compelling as that might be.",1123977600,6,3610,4.3610698365527485
1049518,4,6305537801,"A WALK ON THE MOON as written by Pamela Gray (""Music of the Heart"") and directed by actor Tony Goldman conjures up more atmosphere for the year 1969 than any film to date.  Remember Woodstock, the Jewish summer retreats in the Catskills, hippies, face and body painting, threats from the Vietnam era and promises of space habitation by the famous first walk on the moon?  It is all faithfully created here as the background for a lovely little sentimental tale about family and fidelity.

The Kantrowitz family - Pearl (Diane Lane), Marty (Liev Schreiber), Alison (Anna Paquin), Daniel (Bobby Boriello) and Marty's mother Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh) - are spending their usual summer away form New York in a Catskill settlement bungalow along with other Jewish families of the same ilk.  All seems swell, except that Marty must spend the weekdays returning to his job as a TV repairman, leaving the family under Pearl's and Lilian's care until his weekend visits.  A hippie blouse salesman Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen) peddles his wares to the settlement and casually but inevitably Pearl feels an attraction to Walker, the man of adventure who represents all the lost dreams of becoming a mother  and wife at the too early age of 17.  Life has slipped her by but feels salvageable in Walker's advances.

Woodstock is close by and Pearl and Walker spend a day of hippie love-in in the crowd, not knowing that teenage Alison is also there observing their free love antics.  This crisis event affects the family's unity and the way Pearl faces her moment of indiscretion with Marty and her children builds to a terrific climax.

Diane Lane, Viggo Mortenson, Liev Schreiber and Tovah Feldshuh completely inhabit these simple characters and pull us into accepting all aspects of the predicament of this family crisis.  The confrontation among Lane, Schreiber and Mortenson is a trio of acting not to be forgotten.  Tony Goldwyn has paced his film beautifully and proves that he has as great skill as a director as well as an actor.  The cinematography by Anthony B. Richmond  is as recreative of a special time on our history as has been captured.  This little film will stay with you long after the credits are over.

1049520,3,6305537801,"There are many similarities between this movie and the first Dirty Dancing movie. Both involve up-tight, conservative families off for a summer of fun in a New Yorky style getaway location. Both involve a female visitor becoming fond of a male worker who is much more laid back and free. Where Dirty Dancing focussed just on the young girl and how she 'became a woman', this movie focusses on the mom (Diane Lane) and how she 'regains her childhood'.

The beginning of the movie is sort of clunky, setting the stage. The family with unappreciative kids. The husband who has become boring - he doesn't even want or understand a desire to try new sexual positions. He doesn't want to talk about what is going on at work or make waves there asking for more time off. The mom sees her daughter finding a voice, flirting with guys, doing all the things she missed out on herself. They set this up rather stick-figuredly, but I get and understand the general gist. Woman trapped in her role. See the Hours movie.

Then along comes the 'blouse man', Viggo. I have a big issue with how they managed this relationship. Viggo is a friendly hippy who sells blouses to the Jewish resort inhabitants. He's equally friendly to everyone. Sure, the mom craves affection. Sure, Viggo talks to her 2 or 3 times. But then she calls him up for sex - and he shows up to be her 'back door man' without a blink? He brings her right into his back room and, even though she's talking loudly about her family and obviously having second thoughts, all he says is ""want me to stop?"" It was very artificial feeling. And almost immediately we are launched into montages of them having sex everywhere - in streams, in dales, in fields. Sure, he gets her to jump into the water. But it really seems to be all about sex.

I'm all for sex, I think sex is great. But I think it really diminishes the story. The story began as a mom who was accused of ""having no causes"" and who missed out on her childhood of flirting. So as a result she goes out for lots of sex with a guy whose name she doesn't even know until they're halfway into it? Then then crank it into overdrive with a sequence of bizarre coincidences. The daughter, running off to Woodstock (which is very poorly replicated), sees her half naked mom kissing Viggo. Later, the mom is off chatting with Viggo when her young son is almost slain by wasps, and of course Viggo shows up to take care of the kid. And we top off with the contrived-and-tense scene of the betrayed dad having to thank Viggo for that work.

I think contrived is really the word that comes to mind for most of this. There are some really meaningful nuggets in here - the talk that mom and daughter finally have, where they both become more human for a while. The fact that the daughter wants to be ""the wild teenager"" and needs the mom to be a stable force in her life, even while the daughter says she hates the mom. The dad's hurt anger at being betrayed, and the fact that he has in fact been very disappointed with his life as well but did not act out as a result. The environment is also very realistic - I remember those styles of cabins, those types of pillows and decorations. The over-use of Yiddish sayings was a little much, but they were trying to bludgeon it into our heads that this was an ethnic group of people.

Even more contrived is the finale. The movie was very Hollywood - there really was little doubt that this is how it would end up.

On the positive side, the soundtrack here is just AMAZING and right on. Diane really does a good job with the script she was given, on showing the pulls and tugs in her life, her attempts to have something more and how she is pushed back into place at each turn. To be fair, the husband does say near the end that she COULD have pushed harder if she really wanted to, to make her needs known. But she was pushing hard already and was in return being pushed down into place. Is he really saying that it's her own fault for not pushing *really* hard? Isn't that what she in fact did with Viggo, just pushed hard for something she wanted? In any case, you do see that angst and desire for fun and desire to do the right thing all conflicting within Diane.

How about Viggo? Again, this script didn't really give him much to work with. How many lines does he really get? A few ""this looks nice on you"" lines, then he shows up to be a call-on-demand gigilo, then lots of scenes of sex. A few hokey lines about ""here's the cool way to cure wasp stings"", one or two lines about travelling across the US, and it's over. There was no construction of a relationship, no sharing of ideas, no melding of minds. No staring at the stars discussing infinity. I realize romance doesn't have to be esoteric. But if it was just about wham-bam sex, the story looses a lot of its meaning. It would have been SO much more gripping if he had dreams as well, and shared those dreams with her, and those dreams were incredibly similar. It would have meant something then, that they had considered running off hand in hand.

A nice watch, but many other movies tackle this same theme with a MUCH more realistic and involving storyline.",1112832000,9,5168,4.364864864864865
1049521,3,6305537801,"Goldwyn, with platinum Hollywood credentials courtesy of being the grandson of Samuel Goldwyn (as in Metro-*Goldwyn*-Mayer), is relatively new to the directing business - this is his debut, and he's directed two others since. He is better known as an actor for his roles in *Ghost*, *The Pelican Brief* and *Nixon."" In the HBO miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon, "" Goldwyn played astronaut Neil Armstrong, first man to walk on the moon, and perhaps was inspired to base this film, called *A Walk on the Moon*, on unrelated events that occur on that famous night. Goldwyn also seemed to take a good long look at *Dirty Dancing* before he made this film - unarguably a dangerous proposition - but he seemed to be able to determine what parts of it were charming and which parts were schlock. He, thankfully, left most of the schlock on the cutting room floor. Like *Dirty Dancing*, it is the story of a Jewish family spending the summer at a resort in upstate New York. Where *Dirty Dancing* took place in 1963 as the world was just beginning to notice the changes, *Moon* is set in the summer of 1969 and the world's already on fire, but these people don't know it. Diane Lane and Liev Schreiber play Pearl and Marty Kantrowitz, a young blue-collar couple who began having children at a very young age, missing out on their own youth. As their daughter, Alison (Paquin), comes of age, she faces the inevitable gulf that separates her from her parents - it was a requirement that children felt estranged from their parents in 1969 - but her parents simply aren't that much older than she is. Life is pretty dull at the resort, with the highlights being visits from the ""Knish Man,"" the ""Ice Cream Man"" and the ""Blouse Man."" Pearl, who finds herself alone during the week while Marty goes back into the city to work, falls hard for the ""Blouse Man,"" a hippie who lives life on his own terms (the movie had the regrettable working title of *Blouse Man*). The entire resort is excited about the impending moonwalk, but Marty won't be able to make it back in time to see it with Pearl. Pearl spends the night in her own world of celestial bodies and shooting stars as she gives herself to the hippie blouse man. Meanwhile, not far away, is this event happening - no one really knows what it's about - it's called ""Woodstock."" Daughter Alison wants to go, but is forbidden to. She runs away and goes anyway, running into - who else? - her mother who has been taken there by the Blouse Man. Mom inadvertently gets dosed with acid and trips out, and daughter comes unglued over it, screaming, ""I'm the teenager! Not you! You're my mom!"" The story gets a little messy here and there, as daughter comes to terms with the fact that she may not be quite so different from her parents, and the parents come to terms with the fact that modern life has just about left them in the dust. It is a touching ending as the parents are trying to work it out between them, which seemed somehow unusual - it the Sixties most parents would have split up to ""find themselves."" It is a refreshing film, nonetheless, with a very good performance from Lane and a number a good performances from lesser-known cast members.",1106438400,15,3196,4.540727902946274
1049522,5,6305537801,"My husband and I own this movie and think it's fabulous on every level. We've watched it many times since it was first released. Diane Lane and Liev Schrieber are both marvelous actors and are able to convey so much about their emotions with small moments. Tovah Feldshuh, as the wise mother-in-law, is perfect. The changing times are believably portrayed in this story about a couple who married young in a different time and now find their world changing. (I was 18 at the time of the moon landing and Woodstock so witnessed the era firsthand.) One of the things that is so good about this movie is that all the characters are good, well-intentioned people - there is no ""bad"" guy here, even the gorgeous ""blouse man,"" played by Viggo Mortensen, is a decent guy. I love it that both Pearl and Marty, after they realize some new things about each other, are willing to try and find their way back to each other in this new world. The final scene of them dancing on the porch couldn't be better.

Despite the fact that three years after this movie, Diane Lane was in ""Unfaithful,"" they are very different movies and ""A Walk on the Moon"" is superior because it has so much heart. I can very strongly recommend this movie.",1098316800,60,1220,4.520361990950226
1049523,2,6305537801,"Diane Lane (Unfaithful, Murder At 1600) plays Pearl, a married mother with 2 kids and a working husband and a devoted mother.

Lane get's lonely, so when the new ""blouse man"", played by Aragorn, no I mean Viggo Mortensen (A Perfect Murder, Albino Alligator) comes to camp, she starts to fall for his good looks and his blouses (tee-hee)and she does end up sleeping with the man. Meanwhile, her hormonal daughter, Anna Paquin (X-Men 1,2), starts to gets signs of becoming a woman. Viggo and Lane's passion becomes more and Lane's mother finds out she is schtupping the blouse man. Her husband, Schrieber finds out and that's when it starts to become intense. A little bit slice of life, a little big of family problems, spun together into a directing debut for Tony Goldwyn (Kiss The Girls, Ghost) which can only goes so far but doesnt happen for me. I expected Schrieber to fight Viggo and Viggo takes out his LOTR sword, jumps on Hidalgo and kills Schrieber but he doesnt. Though, can you tell me if there is any women out there that would not have an affair with Viggo Mortensen? I stand corrected. Julie Kavnar (Marge Simpson on the Simpsons) is unbilled but you don't see her but you hear her voice (she's the woman who talks threw the camp's speakers)",1095292800,3,1408,4.613545816733068
1049524,2,6305537801,"Maybe it's just some quirk of fate that I seem to have watched so many films where Diane Lane was playing basically the same role -- the seemingly happily married housewife who has a hot n' sexy love affair and then returns to her loving and basically decent husband. The most famous of these is obviously ""Unfaithful"", for which she justifiably won an Oscar. But Ms. Lane had a lot of practice, because she did two nearly identical roles just a couple years before ""Unfaithful""...little known indies. One is ""Gunshy"" where her hottie lover is CSIs William Petersen...the other is this movie, ""Walk on the Moon"" with LOTRs Viggo Mortensen.
So if you dug Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful"", here is another shot to see her in basically the same situation and expressing much of the same emotion. What is it about this actress that just screams to casting directors ""Cheatin' spouse""? I have no idea...Ms. Lane is a good actress, with a nice look of faded prettiness, like a slightly over the hill cheerleader, and I liked her work in ""Unfaithful"" very much. But there she was playing a rich waspy housewife...here we are expected to accept her blonde patrician looks as a working class Jewish housewife from 1960s Brooklyn. Sorry, this does not fly. Diane Lane is the antithesis of such a character...she's physically all wrong (the attempt to give her ""kinky"" wavy dark hair is particularly off base) and she is not Meryl Streep with the accent, so it comes off forced and awkward...she goes in and out of dialect. (She has the same problem in ""Gunshy"", where she is supposed to be New Jersey mobster's gun moll.)
There is a potentionally interesting story here in the parallel between the mother's sexual awakening with her hippie lover and her 14 year old daughters sexual awakening, but the daughter (the very talented Anna Paquin from ""The Piano"") and her story are severely short-shifted in order to give maximum screen time to Lane and Mortensen. Viggo Mortensen, who comes off very wooden here although he's awesomely handsome, is basically fulfilling the part of ""bimbo boyfriend"". (Oh well, it's fair enough when women get so many bimbo roles in the movies.) There is certainly no sign of the Aragorn to come, because he's so vague, unfocused and bland that he basically registers as having no personality...this makes it very clear that he's just a sexy body for Pearl (Lane) to screw.
That leaves Liev Shrieber, the husband, as the sole sympathetic character and he does well with it. The story cuts out early enough that the audience doesn't have to deal with what will certainly be chapter two -- the bitter residue that an affair leaves even when both parties promise to forgive and forget. (And would you want to be Liev Shreber trying to compete with your wife's sexy memories of Viggo Mortensen?)
The background of a Jewish family summer camp in the Catskills is interesting but this was much better done in ""Dirty Dancing"". The real lame spot in this movie is the attempt to have the mother & lover meet up with the daughter & boyfriend at Woodstock. Actually the whole plot and setting is contrived around this point, i.e., that hippie Woodstock was actually held in the vicinity of these tacky family vacation camps. Obviously being a low budget indie, there is no ability to recreate ANYTHING about the crowds, bands, atmosphere, rain, mud or period ambiance of Woodstock...it would strain the abilities of a big budget film. So it's kinda embarassing to see them even try. It takes whatever credibility we have given the situation and basically blows it. It might have worked better and been cleverer just to have the characters talk about having BEEN at Woodstock, rather than trying to show something so enormous on such a tiny budget.(...)
Utlimately, this comes across as a sort of Lifetime TV movie and I don't mean that in a good sense. There are lots of interesting intentions here that don't work, and a LOT of excruciating dialogue between the characters...the kind that I imagine sends most male viewers to the fridge for a beer. This isn't a movie that your husband or boyfriend will enjoy or even tolerate.
Pretty much just a chance to pant over Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen a couple years before they became big stars and not a whole lot else. A very forgettable and slow paced film.",1087171200,15,4312,4.781501340482574

The music is outstanding - straying away from the obvious music you can always tie to the 60's generation, and playing lesser known, more folk music sets the mood for this film.  ""Summertime"" by Janis Joplin (Big Brother & The Holding Company) and ""Today"" and ""Embryonic Journey"" by Jefferson Airplane make the movie for me!
It's a tale of a ""by the book"" young Jewish mother who feels that she's missed her young adult years because she became a wife and mother too young.  Enter Viggo Mortensen (aka, The Blouse Man), the quiet, beautiful hippie to sweep her off her feet, and show her just what she has been missing.
If you're looking for a deep, meaningful look at real life in the 60's, this probably isn't the movie for you.  However, if you want to watch a sweet movie that will take you away to another time for a couple hours, then I'd recommend it.

I enjoyed this movie and found that it was like watching a super-sized episode of ""The Wonder Years.""  Diane Lane was good, but I found her character too similiar to the one she played in ""Unfaithful.""
I have to admit that I decided to watch this movie because of Viggo Mortensen.  However, I was disasppointed in his performance and found him very stiff and unimpressive, similar to ""A Perfect Murder.""  Cute, but not much else.  It is actually hard to believe that this is the same actor who is so incredible as Aragorn in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.
Anna Paquin is good, but I actually felt the husband, Liev Schreiber, gave the most impressive performance.  I found myself rooting for him throughout the movie and hoping that Diane Lane would get her act together.

It's a coming-of-age (the daughter, played by Anna Paquin) story; it's a tale of a marriage turning boring and of temptation knocking at the door (The Blouse Man himself, SO well played by Viggo Mortensen; it's the exploration of the responsibilities that vie with the passions of the mom who sacrificed her youth and dreams to unplanned pregnancy and early marriage (so perfectly played by the lovely Diane Lane); the rage of the mostly clueless but loving and dutiful husband (Liev Schreiber), and the incomparable Tovah Feldshuh as the wise and sassy mother-in-law who literally and figuratively smacks sense into everyone's heads.

As the first man walks on the moon, his experience coincides with this lady's first walk on the terrain of an extramarital affair. Both are free in a new frontier.

Walk on the Moons story is so much more interesting, erotic and poetic in obvious as well as subtle ways.  1st, Viggo Mortenson is a worthy temptation to stir the waters of doubt.  The writers and actors present more conflict articulating a marriage at crossroads of changing times and a couple that married too young.  There are also more interesting subplots. The husband (wearing toy cowboy attire or trying to dance to Jimi Hendrix), mother-in-law (strong and loving) and kids all add more interesting dimensions to the infidelity Diane Lane brings to the screen.  She is not all selfish addiction and has more rounded reasons for seeking really rockin bons temps with the blouse man. This added more suspense and satisfaction at the end. As enticing as Viggos eyes and voice are,  the soundtrack is rich and offers a pleasantly and sensually surprising selection of songs.

Everything about the production design of this movie is amazingly accurate - from the black and white TV's that only give you a viewable picture if you smack them on the side to the tie dye clothing. Viggo Mortensen and Diane Lane provide the gentle flames of this bittersweet (and clearly temporary ) romance. Liev Scrheiber gives one of his best performances as the betrayed husband, and Tovah Feldshuh is wonderful as the mensch mother in law. Ann Paquin does a terrific turn as the adolescent daughter - there isn't a bad performance anywhere here.
The music adds to the overall impact of the film with carefully chosen snippets of Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, Ritchie Havens, etc. Maybe this flim won't do it for those less nostalgic for the 60's, but this movie struck me as an affectionate look back at that period.

I guess this must have been a sleeper when it was released to theatres because I never heard of the film until recently.

1049663,5,6305537801,"I saw ""Unfaithful"" before this, liked it very much then, and still do.  But I wonder what kind of a review I would have given it if I had seen this movie first.  It deals with the same topic, played by the same actress.  Diane Lane is in a relatively stable marriage, but gets into a situation where she, let's say, wanders a bit.  Which is followed by the inevitable discovery and dilemma of ""What's next?"".
""Unfaithful""'s final third had an issue that I thought made it less of a good movie.  In that one, an act of violence happens between two of the three of the triangle, and I thought too much time was spent focusing on that, instead of the meat of the story, which was the infidelity.  This movie has no such problem.  In both, the straying is discovered, and in both, there are decent ""What now?"" scenes.  But this movie I think is better because there is no act of violence that becomes the unifying focus.  The infidelity remains the main issue, and it's a greater writing challenge to settle the issue without the distractions the later movie brought.
So this is the better Diane Lane infidelity movie.  You also get to see Viggo Mortenson in a role drastically different from ""G.I. Jane"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"".  From an interview I saw of him, his personality seems more in tune with ""Walk on the Moon"" that the other action films, which shows him as a pretty good actor.",1048636800,8,1389,4.429133858267717

But this movie, which suggests that producer Dustin Hoffman misses the halcyon late-Sixties Catskills, goes on to offer some wonderful portrayals and convincing dialogue. Housewife/mother Pearl (Lane) is suffering ennui as only a middle-class homemaker can, and unexpectedly finds comfort in the arms of the traveling blouse salesman (Mortensen). Her confusion, coupled with the turbulence of the encroaching Seventies (""Couldn't you set aside your beliefs for one day?"" she pleads with her activist daughter [Paquin]) is completely believable, although I was a little disconcerted by the ease with which I accepted the idea that middle-class angst is an important issue.

Meanwhile, Paquin undergoes her own adolescent revolution; her trials are understood within a larger, supportive Jewish community and its members' obvious, unreserved affection for one another.

As for Schreiber, his youth only occasionally betrays itself, and his acting keeps pace with Lane's and Paquin's (maybe my resistance to his casting is due to the lasting strength of his character in _Daytrippers_, a writer-wannabe who earnestly clings to an idea for an existential novel about a half-man, half-dog. Why he agreed to _Kate & Leopold_ is beyond me, though.)

The friend who accompanied me to _A Walk on the Moon_ was clearly bored, suggesting that this movie might unfairly become lumped into that nefarious genre of ""chick flick.""

Diane Lane's character, Pearl, goes through a transformation that is hard at times to watch.  Although her affair with Walker (the ""blouse man"" played by Viggo Mortensen) happens really quickly, without much obvious attraction between the two characters, it becomes Pearl's release, her way of re-living the teenage years she missed when she was a young, married mother.

My only complaint - the video quality of the dvd is inferior by today's standards.  No enhancement for 16x9 tvs and there is visual moire effect in a number of the scenes.  Hopefully, Miramax will get wise and give this film the quality DVD treatment it deserves.  Sound quality is pretty good, though of course not DTS.
No need to retell the story - covered in other reviews.  I concur with most reviews in the perfect acting.  I want to add extra kudos to Director Goldwyn for holding a consistent tone through difficult moments and screenwriter Gray for crackling dialog that interleaves multiple conversations at once - like real life.  What's amazing is how she never cheapshots her characters or lets her them spout easy answers - the honesty of her characters is breathtaking - a model for our own behavior.
P.S. If you were over 10 in 1969 the soundtrack alone will make you swoon.",1007683200,3,1144,4.633663366336633

It's a film about the stormy turns a family's daily life takes when wife Pearl ( Lane ) meets a charming blouse man ( Mortensen ) . Although it's clear that she does love her husband ( Schreiber ) , she fails to remain faithfull to him . At the same time her daughter ( Anna Paquin ) is slowly becoming a woman . Her first flirt with a boy takes place and the girl , full of doubts and questions tries to come in terms with her puberty . The film's biggest strength is it's cast . Lane gives a quiet , carefull perfomance as the young wife while Mortensen displays once more his poisonous charms . The heart of the film though is Liev Schreiber who gives to his character the human sensitivity he needs to seem believable . He's one of these gifted , underrated actors ( see also Don Cheadle , Ben Chaplin ) who we would never like to see leading an expensive , supernatural blockbuster movie . What makes A Walk On The Moon so special is that it talks about things and situations which could easily be true . Frightengly naturall are also the supporting actors who have been casted perfectly as everyday-people of that time . The family's unity is in danger and the viewer almost feels Pearl's frustration and agony about the future . Will her acts torn her home apart ? Director Goldwyn dezerves congratulations for risk losing the teenage audience by making a film about family values . If you ask me though , when a movie is as well written and well acted as this one , age is not a factor . As for the ending is one of the smartest , most impulsive and touching ones you'll ever get the chance to see .",997920000,41,1678,4.230529595015576

She plays Pearl, a young mother who feels that she missed her teenage life as she was married way too young. Liev Schreiber plays her husband and Viggo Mortensen is the blouse man with whom she has an affair with. Anna Paquin plays her daughter. Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy from Ghost) direct. The DVD is wonderful. The picture quality is very good and Dolby 5.1 is great during Woodstock. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the lack of extra features. The back cover of the DVD stated that extra features are: Wide Screen and Dolby 5.1. Real generous. But despite that, this DVD deserved to be purchased by any movie lovers.

1049743,5,6305537801,"In ""A Walk on the Moon,"" Diane Lane and Liev Schrieber are fantastic as a moderately stodgy, 30-ish couple, whose placid, hobbit-like life together suddenly feels incredibly boring to Diane Lane. Her early mid-life crisis is pronouncedly exacerbated by the fact that she is experiencing it during the completely insane summer of 1969, right down the road from Woodstock. Due to this personal/marital crisis, she permits the advances of ""the blouse man,"" a local travelling salesman (no smirks, please) to get bolder and bolder. She even starts initiating situations herself, which ineluctably lead to an illicit tryst, and then another, and another... This eventually blows up in her face, of course, and results in a very serious, intelligent look at a troubled marriage in troubled times, and makes the viewer think HARD about what they have in their lives that they feel lucky about, or ought to. There's also a nice little subplot about the daughter in the family coming of age, and how this dovetails with Diane Lane's own awakening.
I have to ask right off the bat -- why isn't Diane Lane better known? It makes no sense at all. I know a number of guys about my age (33) that have harbored a crush on her for decades, ever since ""A Little Romance"" in 1979. Any directors or producers out there -- what gives?!?! Keep her working! It's nice that director Tony Goldwyn took notice of her -- I believe he got his own acting start as one of Jason's victims in ""Friday the 13th, Part 6,"" so I imagine he must have a pretty well-developed sympathy gland, for fellow struggling thespians. Anyway, she's beautiful, highly gifted in her ability to communicate with gestures, and an able imitator of accents. I'm not sure what it is about her that makes her so hard to forget, visually -- she has an ability to simultaneously look shrewd and kind. That could be it. Hollywood being what it is, that shrewd look might be what gets her in trouble. She LOOKS very intelligent. Not that there aren't plenty of highly intelligent actresses out there, but intelligence isn't always one of the very first things you think of when you see them. It just doesn't lend itself to playing starry-eyes ingenues. Actually, I remember seeing in a movie once that there are three ages for actresses in Hollywood -- 1.)Babe, 2.)District Attorney, and 3.)Driving Miss Daisy. Diane Lane has one foot in each of the first two of those stages. Let's hope she sees more work.
Okay, enough gushing. Liev Shrieber is really terrific too, as the beleaguered husband Marty. I first saw Liev on film as a psychotic cop who gets possessed by a sort of demonic oil slick (yes, I'm serious) in an adaptation of a Dean Koontz book, ""Phantoms"" -- so, I wasn't expecting much here. I was very pleasantly surprised, however -- the man has range. Marty is a believable, likeable, well-developed character. Let's hope Liev keeps working, too... The supporting cast is solid as well -- Viggo Mortensen is pretty cool as a sort of free-wheeling 60s guy, who looks like a Doobie Brother who took an unfortunate career detour into apparel sales. He has a better role than you might expect -- more complex. He's a human being, not just an excuse for Diane Lane to run amok for a few weeks... Anna Paquin is terrific too -- I'm pretty sure she won an Oscar when she was about 10 or 11, so perhaps competence is not so startling coming from her.
Anyway, this is just a really nice, mature movie all around. Two thumbs up.",985305600,5,3473,4.685761047463175
1049744,2,6305537801,"The universal theme of coming to terms with the loss of youth and accepting a life of unfulfilled hopes and dreams is explored in ""A Walk On the Moon,"" directed by Tony Goldwyn.  Diane Lane stars as Pearl Kantrowitz, a thirty-one year old mother of two, the oldest of whom, Alison (Anna Paquin), is fourteen; her husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), is a square shooter who loves his wife and family and provides for them by working long hours in a shop repairing television sets.  It's the summer of `69, and while on the family's extended vacation-- during which Marty must return to work for the week-- Pearl falls into discontent, and with Woodstock about to happen a mere stone's throw from the campground/resort at which they are staying, she soon succumbs to the siren's song of the `60s:  The inhibition, freedom and free love-- all of which have been denied her since giving birth to her daughter at age seventeen.  There's an honesty to Goldwyn's film, and though he captures the sense of the times in which the story is set fairly well, he nevertheless fails to elicit much sympathy for his leading lady, Lane.  Perhaps it's because, though there is much about Pearl with which to identify, her story is just too familiar; her situation is far from being unique, and she has a decent, upper middle-class life, with a loving husband and two great kids.  The fact that she started young and that her dreams were never realized is a shame, but it's not like she's the only one to whom such a fate has befallen.  And her futile attempt at regaining her lost years comes across as somewhat shallow and decidedly unsympathetic; and without that sympathy the film sputters and finally stalls, even as Neil Armstrong is beginning his historic walk on the Moon.  There's no question that Lane is attractive, and physically she fits the role of Pearl perfectly.  But she simply doesn't possess the wherewithal to sell her character in this film.  The emotional turmoil of what Pearl is experiencing seems restricted to the surface, and she never manages that depth of feeling that would've made the necessary connection with the audience.  It's not that Lane is bad in this role, it's just that she's not that good.  There are just too many gaps in credibility and too many false moments to be overlooked.  It's as if the character throughout remained just beyond her grasp.  Liev Schreiber, on the other hand, is outstanding as Marty.  You have no trouble believing he is exactly who and what he is supposed to be.  This is a character to whom most people will be able to relate, and if only Lane had been able to evoke the same kind or response as Schreiber, it would've made a tremendous difference in the overall aspect of the film.  Anna Paquin gives a noteworthy performance as well, successfully capturing the angst of puberty while coping with an ever-changing world.  The supporting cast includes Viggo Mortensen as Walker Jerome, the traveling salesman with whom Pearl attempts to reconcile her lost youth; Tovah Feldshuh (Lilian Kantrowitz); Bobby Boriello (Daniel); Stewart Bick (Neil); Jess Platt (Herb); Star Jasper (Rhoda) and Julie Kavner (Voice of the Social Director).  There are some poignant moments in Goldwyn's film, and it does generate a certain sense of loss and longing;  but overall, ""A Walk On the Moon"" is at best a momentary diversion that comes across like a finger painting on an impressionist's canvas.  That is stays afloat at all is due mainly to Schreiber and Paquin's performances.  Other than that, this is-- unfortunately-- a rather forgettable film that never quite attains the level of drama to which it aspires.",984268800,4,3650,4.834405144694534
1049745,3,6305537801,"It's 1969 in a bungalow colony near Woodstock where husbands come up weekends to visit their wives and kids. Pearl Kantrowitz,  at 32 is the mother of a 14 year old daughter and a 5 year old son.  When a hippie salesman comes to the bungalow colony to sell blouses, she's drawn into an affair with him.  This is a time period that I'm familiar with.  I, myself, was only 30 years old then.  I, too, had children.  I also looked at the hippie world as an adventure that was somehow passing me by.  I remember those feelings and those wonder years.
Diane Lane, cast as the mother, with her confusion and mixed loyalties, played her part well.  So did the hippie lover, Viggo Mortensen, who has the kind of good looks that are sketched on the covers of romance novels.  Anna Paquen is superb as the 14 year old daughter, coming of age herself, who goes to Woodstock and sees her mother there with the hippie.  And the husband, played by Liev Shreiber is wonderful as he tries to cope with his wife's changes and his love for his family.  Cast as Pearl's Jewish mother-in-law, Tovah Feldshuh should have been better.  The role is a good one, but the Yiddish words as written in the script were awkward.
One of the reasons I hesitate to recommend this video is that the setting was artificial.  For example, in the few Woodstock scenes, the sun was always shining and it seemed to last just one short afternoon.  The real Woodstock lasted 3 days and it rained constantly.  I also thought the Jewishness and silliness of the bungalow colony was overdone.  Every single cliche and Yiddish expression were thrown in.  I found this distracting from the central human story of a family trying to cope with a changing world.  The scenes were much too long and the story moved too slowly.  Too many scenes were just talking and no action.  The plot was predictable and there were no surprises.  And I kept looking at my watch every ten minutes.
The title refers to the moon walk by the astronauts,  watched on flickering black and white television sets that summer.  It's a big theme reflecting a changing world.  But in spite of good acting and interesting story, this film tried hard, but just didn't make it.",976924800,42,2199,4.536895674300254

But all in all, the movie has nothing very fresh to say, and is  best as an exercise in nostalgia for a milieu that has never quite been  given its due.",968112000,,523,4.65934065934066
1049747,5,6305537801,"Since her debut in 1979, Diane Lane has continued to be an incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing actress.  As a BIG fan, I saw this movie just because of Diane Lane but was so blown-away at the performances of Liev  Schreiber(husband), Viggo Mortensen(""blouse man/lover"") and an  all-grown-up Anna Paquin who plays a typical rebellious teen. Together the  typical Jewish family experiences the angst of every family living in 1969-  teen sexuality, for a girl-getting your period, a love affair, and the bond  of traditions and true love.  For those of us not familiar with the Jewish  way of community, it is a very touching and endearing story.  Diane Lane  continues to be the best kept secret in Hollywood, but, I am sure, she,  herself keeps it that way, holding no ""STAR"" attitude such as  other actors making the big bucks.  You can always expect a great  ""walk on the moon"" from Diane and this movie doesn't disappoint!  This film was entirely UNDER rated with the directing talents of Tony  Goldwyn(""Ghost"") and producing skill of Dustin Hoffman. All in  all, a pleasant surprise!",959040000,12,1088,4.922651933701657

She married early and settled into  the role of wife and mother without really getting to experience her youth.  Set in 1969, the year of Woodstock and the moon walk, Pearl, her husband,  Marty, (Liev Schrieber), his mother, and their two kids travel to their  yearly campsite in the Catskills, 2 hours north of New York City. The same  cabin, the same scenery and the same people every summer, and, as usual,  Marty has to remain in the city during the week working at his dead end job  as a TV repairman to support their family. Pearl resents Marty's absence,  and yearns for the freedom of being young again. As the story unfolds,  Pearl finds herself attracted to a travelling blouse salesman who has come  into the cabin grounds to set up shop. The turning point for Pearl is that  fateful weekend of the moon walk, when Marty is unable to return from the  city because of all the TV's needing repair work. So begins a voyage of  discovery for Pearl, an awareness of her self that is paralleled well  alongside her daughter's first tentative discovery of young love,  Woodstock's discovery of free love, and a country's discovery of the world  beyond.  Diane Lane is superbly convincing as a hopeful, but despairing  young woman and she is well supported by a strong cast of supporting  actors. Anna Paquin is marvellous as the young teenage daughter, Viggo  Mortenson is believable as the sensitive, hippy lover of Pearl, and Liev  Schreiber is outstanding as the cheated husband.

1049820,5,6305537801,"What a nice change to see a film which is simple, honest and made without special effects or car chases. And not a gun in sight. Is that what the sixties was really like?
This is a charming film about the people we  used to be back when you could still smoke cigarettes, have a cocktail  after a hard day at the office and fool around without much chance of  getting a deadly disease. Although this film has a slightly serious side to  it, it is in the main, a sort of look back at those years which flew past  all too quickly and took a great many people along with them, in a sort of  flood of home improvements and cheap mountain holidays. It was all a bit of  a whirl. And then there was Woodstock and this guy walking on the moon and  things were starting to somehow, unaccountably, come apart.
Tony Goldwyn  deserves a lot of credit for even attempting to make a film like this, let  alone succeeding on his first attempt at directing. It's a very pleasing  result from A to Z and the great thing about it, apart from the absence of  gratuitous Hollywood muck, is that it just gets on with the story, with  nobody's ego getting in the road and spoiling its simplicity. Diane Lane  and Viggo Mortenson are well matched as the couple about to discover  Woodstock and experience some of its encroaching peace and love. Anna  Paquin is perfectly believable as a young kid trying to catch up with mum,  and having her eyes opened to more than the usual extent. Leif Schreiber is  possibly the best of them all in this interesting cast, as he renders a  very strong cuckolded 1960s male of the macho variety, and does so very  sensitively. Tovah Feldshuh is also very strong as his all-knowing,  all-seeing mother. A very worthwhile film, and such a change from the usual  workaday cinema coming out of the West.",956620800,2,1812,4.410876132930514

Lane seems to leap out of  the movie screen and into real life; no suspension of disbelief is  required.  I was surprised that Diane Lane was not  nominated for an  Oscar (best actress).  I felt that her role in this movie was similar to  that of Julianne Moore's in ""The End of the Affair,"" but her  performance was much better than that of Julianne's (despite the fact that  Julianne Moore is my favorite actress).  Lane portrays the conflicts of the  human heart with such remarkable plausibility.  This is the most genuine or  ""real to life"" performance which I have ever witnessed.

The chemistry between Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen was electric. I was  surprised that this movie wasn't more popular, but I think that for a  viewer to really enjoy this movie, one must have some fond  ""connection"" to the era of Woodstock. Viewers won't find  airheaded characters in this movie, and don't watch it hoping to see  bare-breasted women swaying to Woodstock music on acid trips.

As a mother of two small children, who has walked close to  the fires of temptation, I felt as though my soul was being laid out in  this film. I believe that in each of us, lies the desire to be 'free' and  'unfettered' as Lane portrays.  Her question early on in the film, ""Do  you ever feel trapped by your life?"", is one that resonates through  many women's and men's minds daily. I was totally captivated by the  performances, and was so glad to have happened upon it on the video  shelves.

I do recommend finding and reading the deleted scenes (they have yet to be released in video form and I would love to see a Directors Cut with them added). Almost all the scenes were of the Blouse Man and the cuts were awful because those scenes paint a much deeper picture of both Walker and Pearl. Second, and the reason why I only give it four stars is because the story fails to find the equilibrium necessary in good stories. If the story were to focus on the husband, Marty, as the protagonist the appropriate title would be The Emasculation of Marty. From the husbands viewpoint, Pearl is awash in self-pity and goes to great lengths to punish her husband over his failure to meet her every need. In two of the main scenes, she goes to the Blouse Man only after Marty fails, through no fault of his, to be where she wants, when she wants. The scene where Marty enters his bungalow to find the Blouse Man sitting in his chair with his family is especially painful. It is like a Norman Rockwell painting with the husband whited out and replaced with a stranger. Moreover, this occurs less than twenty-four hours after Marty confronted Pearl over the affair. All of Pearls loving looks are reserved for the Blouse Man. Not once, in the entire movie does Pearl ever tell her husband that she loves him; indeed, it is obvious that she does not really. She is only back home for the kids. That Marty could forgive her so quickly and with so little remorse on her part is where the imbalance lies. Marty is a saint, the Blouse man is freedom symbolized, but Pearl, despite being portrayed brilliantly by Diane Lane, is petty and selfish. This despite the presence of her mother-in-law who as a single mother represents Pearls future if Marty dumps her.",1522195200,,1817,4.509090909090909
