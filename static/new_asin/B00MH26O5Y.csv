6577583,5,B00MH26O5Y,"Mill Creek Entertainment put these 2 seasons together very cheaply. Discs are stacked up on one another, no subtitles, and no episode insert. To know the episodes, one has to look at the discs themselves. This is why they are able to sell it at a great price.",1414886400,24,259,4.416666666666667

6577599,4,B00MH26O5Y,I watched this series with my 12&13 year old Grandgirlies this past sumner. The innocence and good moral stories held all of our attentions. Sally Field is the perfect girl for this role. There are characters that keep the story lines interesting. And a few episodes have original songs that make those episodes priceless!,1473379200,,322,4.981481481481482
6577600,5,B00MH26O5Y,"Great Product!  I really love watching ""The Flying Nun"".  Simple, Fun, Easy-Going Entertainment.  If you want to feel good then watch Sally Field in this 60's TV series.  I wish they would release Season 3, the final season of the show so I could buy it.  Also, this 2 season DVD set comes in one DVD case with 5 DVDs.  I'm really happy with the product and bought it for less than $10.  Great deal!",1471651200,,399,4.24

6577608,5,B00MH26O5Y,"Yes, I enjoyed the ""Flying Nun# series DVDs. They are so funny and fun to watch. A young nun wears a corona hat that looks like wings. She was small and lightweight 90 pounds. Whenever there are strong winds blowing, she was able to fly on the currents. Fun to watch her fly! I love to fly too! Good clean shows!",1462147200,,312,4.131147540983607

6577613,4,B00MH26O5Y,"I did not buy this from Amazon; I came upon it while shopping and decided to see if I would like it. While I really enjoyed the first season, the second season is far more slapstick and not as much to my taste.
I know Sally Field disliked doing the series, but she really did a good job for all the goofy situations she had to get into. The idea of a little Nun that flies does seem corny and unbelievable, but then there are just as unbelievable shows about ""Strange visitors from another planet"" who come to earth and fly too, so a flying Nun isn' t  much of a stretch of the imagination really. After all, it is the theory that ""mass, plus weight, plus distribution being components of aerodynamics"" that helps aircraft to fly too. (I'm a retired airline employee who loaded planes, so I am familiar with those calculations needing to be as precise as possible).
My only reasons for the four stars is there is just too much slapstick in season 2, and the fact that only two of the three seasons have been released. Since the two season set came out ten years ago, it is doubtful they will release the third season now. However I would buy that third season too, or even a new complete season set, if that were to be made available, since I have a friend who would love to see this series too and have peaked the interest of other folks when I told them that I have added this to my collection.
And if you by chance are Catholic, as I am, don't worry about feeling scandalized by this comedy. The technical advisors were from the Catholic television review board, in place then, who made sure there was nothing that would offend.",1458950400,,1631,4.3475409836065575
6577614,5,B00MH26O5Y,Great deal great job thank you very much,1457308800,,40,4.125
6577615,5,B00MH26O5Y,So great watching the series again. I have not seen it since I was a kid and my son is loving it! He claimed he could see wires on Sally Field but I explained it was because the film is old and they are just scratches on the transfer. He has not stopped watching it since the DVD's arrived. Other actors in the show are brilliant. The idea is crazy but the actors are so good they carry it off. Fun to watch in 2016 despite being made 50 years ago.,1455494400,,448,3.934065934065934
6577616,5,B00MH26O5Y,"I family comedy for everyone!

The Flying Nun is based on 1965 book The Fifteenth Pelican. Sally Field plays Sister Bertrille who is a new nun at a convent and discovers because of her hat (which acts like wings on a plane), she can fly. It is a innocent, fun, often silly even story (situational comedy).  Although there were really 3 seasons and an hour long movie  for some reason only seasons 1 and 2 are on DVD. UNLIKE today's TV series seasons, this show has 30 episodes for 1 season and 26 for second so a total of 56.
GOOD value
Clean family fun
Simpler time and place (I am so glad to revisit that time and laugh as I did as a child watching these. Back then I thought she could really fly.

I paid full price and it is WELL worth the money, just wish I could locate the rest of the series",1455148800,,798,4.096153846153846
