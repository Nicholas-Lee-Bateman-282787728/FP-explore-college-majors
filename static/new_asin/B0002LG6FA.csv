8028848,5,B0002LG6FA,"This double-disk foreign-language no-english-subtitles DVD is the 1973-4 Russian Stop-Motion Musical TV series ""the Wizard of the City of Emeralds"", most likely the first adaptation of the Land of Oz in another language, after Aleksandr Volkov's first Russian translation of the story in 1939 and revison with illustrations in 1959.  Each disk has 5 chapters which is an episode from the TV series.  The actual appearance is of course not state-of-the-art (being the 70s) nor is it irritatingly primitive; it still looks great even in its somewhat cheap making, many times bits of the sets/props slightly move due to its move-bit-by-bit-process.  As this is a Russian adaptaion, it is different to the Original American Classic, in minor (new names and replacements) and major parts . . .
  Disk 1:  Elli (Dorothy) and her dog Totoshka live in Kansas with her Mother, unaware that Gingemma the Wicked Witch of the East has just created a Hurricane/Tornado, which separates the girl and her dog from her home (her shoes get left behind).  The Munchkins tell Villina the Good Witch of the North and she causes the storm to drop Elli and Totoshka's wagon on top of Gingemma, killing her.  Elli and Totoshka, who can now talk, see the Magic Land and are welcomed by the Munchkins and Villina.  Totoshka stops the Wicked Witch's Owl from taking the Silver Shoes and gives them to Elli, who is instructed to seek out James Goodwin the Wizard of the Emerald City at the end of the Yellow Brick Road, which Villina the Good Witch creates before disappearing.  Elli and Totoshka sing down the path until they see and save Strashela the Scarecrow from the crows and his pole.  Joining them he learns to walk and adds his own verse to the yellow brick road song until, in a forest, they meet and oil the Iron Woodchopper (he too has a name but I can't remember or pronounce it).  After his addition (to both journey and song), a large Troll/Ogre captures Elli and takes her home to eat her, only to have her friends stop him and save her . . . The friends arrive at a big river, so the Iron Woodchopper uses his (magic) axe to make a raft to get them across; Strashela gets caught stuck in the middle and a brief storm throws Elli, Totoshka and Iron woodchopper to shore.  Eventually Lion saves Strashela and joins the friends, only to have his song cut short upon seeing a field of large poppies, which puts the fleshy characters to sleep (doesn't make sense that the Iron Woodchopper should get tired!) until he and Strashela take them out and away from the poppies, only to arrive at a forest in which they battle and defeat a big saber-toothed tiger.  6 Joyous bunnies musically celebrate Lion's courageous victory . . . At Emerald City, Elli and her friends are welcomed in, only after they helped the Gate-Guardians/Soldiers save the surrounding area being turned into a desert by the Flying (No Wings, Circus-dressed) Monkeys.  The friends see the Wizard in his Circus-like Throne Room (who, in disguise and costume, appears earlier than usual here) altogether, but with each interview he changes form (Elli = Giant ?Clown-like? Head, Strashela = Mermaid, Iron Woodchopper = Rhino, Lion = Fire Ball/Light), saying that they must destroy Bastinda, the Wicked Witch of the West . . . A Wolf Patroler on guard tells Bastinda about the approaching friends and she summons the Flying Monkeys.  Elli and her friends arrive at her castle (original) and climb a ladder to enter it, when the Monkeys destroy Strashela & Iron woodchopper and capture Lion and Totoshka, leaving Elli alone and sad.  2 Winkies Slaves help restore the two destroyed friends while Bastinda (after doing a rock-n-roll song!) schemes a ""trippy"" way to get the Silver Shoes from Elli.  In the Witch's castle the Winkies and friends encounter Bastinda, who gets wet and dies, allowing Lion and Totoshka to be freed.  Elli gains the Golden Cap and the service of the Flying Monkeys, who return them to Emerald City . . . 2 different soldiers/gate-guardians are frightened at first, but Totoshka manages in getting James Goodwin out to see the friends.  He sings to them and grants their wishes with a magic act.  When he proclaims Strashela as King, the balloon accidently sets off without Elli and Totoshka, but Elli summons the Monkeys and they in turn bring Stella the Good Witch of the South to get her back home.  Elli gives the Monkeys their freedom and returns home with Totoshka to her mother (the Silver Shoes' end is somewhat original, doesn't go to Kansas yet not lost).
  Disk 2:  This next adventure takes up and combines 2 more Russian Magic Land stories: ""Urfin and the Wooden Soldiers"" and ""the 7 Underground Kings"", also having many songs.  Elli and Totoshka are singing and playing in Kansas with an 'Uncle Henry + Cap'n Bill' character when a little black bird appears with a message telling Elli about how back in the Magic Land, the Owl who once belonged to Gingemma (Wicked East Witch) has a man named Urfin (who looks like Snape from ""Harry Potter"") use Gingemma's box of magic Powder of Life to revive a Bear rug and create an army of Wooden Soldiers to conquer the Emerald City and capture Strashella, rendering Emerald City in ruins.  Iron woodchopper comes to Strashella's aid only to be captured as well . . .  So Elli, Totoshka and ""Uncle Henry/Cap'n Bill"" use a sailboat/ship (on land) to return to the Magic Land.  When the travellers get caught, Villina the Good Witch of the North (who has just witnessed Lion's capture) is asked by the little black bird to help the travellers from a trap, which she does.  After Elli's brief reunion with the 2 Munchkins, they arrive near the Emerald City, narrowly escape a dragon-like creature before rescuing Elli's friends and escaping from the dungeon  . . . After Totoshka retrieves Iron woodchopper's axe, Urfin sings his own song (most likely of his vanity and selfishness).  The Friends and Foes battle eachother in a cannonball-like duel, before the friends escape to avoid danger and capture.  The friends make a successful ambush and Urfin, who is out of magic and army, makes his escape to the Undergound, resulting in the friends' restoration of the Emerald City and its people to its former joyous glory, the Winkies giving the rescuers a new sailboat to return home . . . As Urfin travels underground, Elli and Totoshka meet a young boy who takes them in a boat to a cave where (after getting trapped) they witness a large baby bird hatching from a giant egg and a man who takes them to the Underground Palace of the 7 Underground Kings, one of which become easily manipulated by Urfin . . .  Elli sings a distraction while Totoshka finds his way back to the Magic Land's Emerald City to gain the help of Elli's friends, who once again stop Urfin's selfish plot.  The Fountain puts the Kings and Urfin at peace, allowing the man to dethrone them to avoid anyother foolishness, resulting in a Happy ending for all.
  Naturally of course I have never read the Russian 'Oz' books (but I would like to, at least the ""Wizard"" one), and that hasn't stopped me from enjoying this Russian adaptation.  The Music is just Great!  English viewers won't help but notice how Disk 2's adventure is (coincidentally) a combination of L. Frank Baum's 'Marvelous Land of Oz' (Without the Ozma-type character), and 'Dorothy & the Wizard in Oz' with a bit of 'Road to Oz' and the Fountain of the Water of Oblivian from 'Emerald City of Oz', despite this adventure being completely based on 2 Russian Magic Land stories.  Clearly the first ""Wizard"" disk is the best of the DVD.  This adaptation has MANY Original ideas, some of which influence the 1987 Cinar/Lightyear ""Wonderful"" cartoon.  Again, this adaptation (and I believe every Russian adaptation, except for the original translated book) leaves out the Journey to the South, only this time the Good Witch is brought to Elli in Emerald City by someone else's transportation instead of her own decision.  The Wizard's scenes are very clever; almost everything in the Emerald City has a Circus appearance, a glimpse into his true original character.  The Russian East Witch has a much better design and appearance than the Russian West Witch, in both film and book, and the same thing can be said for THIS Russian North Witch (who looks slightly younger instead of old) over THIS Russian South Witch (who is very fashionable and frilly-dressed).  It's easy to note while watching that as the epiosdes go on, the quality and appearance of the characters and show change from their first view.
Both Disks go for over 1 hr 30 mins resulting in 3 hrs 18 mins (unless you fast forward/skip the repeated opening titles and end credits).  I wonder how it would've gone had this been a ""Wizard only"" adaptation that included the Journey to the South (instead of Fighting Trees and China Country, there was a Flood and Search for Friends) during the 3 hr 18 m on 1 disk - most likely much more faithful and slightly better.  There are many other depictions, alterations, scenes and others that make this adaptation Worth Seeing (e.g. Gingemma East Witch lives in dark place, yet when killed, her land becomes bright and cheerful).  Although the second disk is not as great as the first, it is still great nonetheless to have on DVD.  This DVD is very enjoyable to watch and an interseting first look into the Russian alteration of Oz.",1194912000,,9403,4.746314496314496
