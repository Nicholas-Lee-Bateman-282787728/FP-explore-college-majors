8055514,4,B00083EZC8,"""Hitler's Children"" is a 1943 B&W classic and based on Gregor Ziemer's book, EDUCATION FOR DEATH. It stars Bonita Granville and Tim Holt. As a anti-Nazi propaganda film, it was a huge hit in 1943, serving to motivate Americans and their Allies in the war effort. The film is a lurid and horrific take of life in Nazi Germany--exposing atrocities rarely known at the time. Major issues addressed: lebensborn (a Nazi initiated program that encouraged the ""racially pure"" to breed children for Hitler), forced sterilization, and Hitler Youth cruelty. A must-see for anyone who is interested in WWII history.",1152921600,15,604,5.111111111111111
8055515,5,B00083EZC8,"This is what was said of Hitlers Children when it was released,and as a result,my sister and i could not see this film untill we were grown because of a scene with men and women swimming together. Seems tame now.

This is one of my favorite films,wish it were available on DVD.",1144281600,8,277,4.326923076923077
