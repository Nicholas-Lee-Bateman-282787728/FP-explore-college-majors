6685823,4,B00NYC3S78,"""Pitch Perfect 2"" (2015 release; 115 min.) opens with our beloved a cappella band the Bellas giving a performance at the Kennedy Center in the presence of President Obama, when Fat Amy encounters a 'costume malfunction' of epic proportions. As a result of this 'muffgate' incident, the Bellas are suspended but they manage to negotiate a loophole: win the a cappella world championships in Denmark, and they regain full standing. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie. Will the ladies be able to pull it off? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this sequel is the full length feature directing debut of actress-producer Elizabeth Banks (she also reprises her role as Gail, the TV commentator), and Banks does a very capable job as director. The movie is paced perfectly, and even better, remains faithful to the spirit of the first Pitch Perfect. Let's face it, if you loved the first movie, all you want to see is the return of the original gang (mostly Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson, I suppose), and find excuses for them to sing and interact. This time around, the big rival for the girls is a German band called Das Sound Machine, and I have to admit, DSM sounds and performs impressively. We are also introduced to a new member of the Bellas, Emily (played by Hailee Steinfeld, the young girl in True Grit is now a young woman). Beware: there are plenty of fairly (c)rude jokes and lines in the movie (such as: Emily's last name is Junk-Hardon, no, really) so that even thought this movie is rated PG-13, frankly I wouldn't recommend taking young kids to this. Some of the better lines come from the TC commentators (played by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins), but my favorite comes from Anna Kendrick's Beca character, when she hisses back to her DSM rivals ""aca-wedersehen, b*tches!"", ha! The music is aplenty in this, even more so than in the first Pitch Perfect, and that's just fine by me (they even find a way of brining ""Cups"" back again). Bottom line: despite the high expectations, Banks & Co. have managed to deliver exactly what the people wanted from this sequel, not a small feat. Not surprisingly, there is already talk of a Pitch perfect 3, with Rebel Wilson already signed on. For my money, if they can't find a way of keeping Anna Kendrick around, my interest in another sequel will nosedive.

I saw the first Pitch Perfect knowing next to nothing about the movie, taking a flyer when it showed on its opening weekend. That screening was not all that well attended but I vividly remember how immensely I enjoyed that movie. Flash forward 3 years: I was really looking forward to seeing PP2. The early evening screening where I saw this at today (Sunday) was PACKED, and then some. The crowd absolutely ate it up, laughing at all the right times, and giving an applause when the house lights turned on. Many of them left as the movie's end titles started to run. A shame for them as they missed a very funny bonus extra which I won't spoil here. Just stick around when the end titles start running! Meanwhile, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1431820800,39,3192,4.657801418439717
6685824,4,B00NYC3S78,"Updated:

After watching this movie a few more times, I think I will give it one more star. I still stand by what I said. It's not as good as the first, but it's better than average.
------------------------------------------------------------

The problem with having such an amazing movie with the first Pitch Perfect is that it makes any sequel that comes after it: hard to top! With this movie, I did see such great story telling and throwing a bunch of funny comedy at me. But, in the end, it's nothing compared to the magic the first movie had.

I really love the story telling in this movie. They didn't just want to bring back the Bellas with another old sing and dance competition. Nope. That would be way too easy and boring too watch. So, instead they created a new problem while having them still have to perform. We still get to see the Bellas kick out their performances in occa competitions, but this time they are doing with an all or nothing condition. Early in the movie, the Bellas made a bad choice while performing to cause them to be ban for life from Occa performing, but there is one thing that can change that and that is win the the World Finals for acapella. Okay, winning The World Finals doesn't sound that hard at first, but the movie made it that seemed to be must harder. They have stated that there has NEVER been an American team that even came close to doing so. Also, it seems that the world, itself, has America. Wow, that stakes have been set up right. Now can they do it?

Now that the Bellas know what they have to do, they actually have to do it! The Bellas biggest threat to win the worlds championships is against the German Team. To me, this is a biggest let down because they made the German Team sounded like they were unstoppable machine. I felt the movie, really wanted to show this, but I didn't see it in them. I knew the bellas can win them very easily. They made them sound like they were really going to bring it, but, they never really did. I was thinking what on earth made them so good? They sang and danced just like the other teams did? They weren't doing anything really special? All their songs were the same as other popular songs as other group sing. In fact, their dance moves weren't that great, it too marchy and too in line for my taste. So, what's so great about them? I say the movie failed to make the German Team much of a threat to anybody. In fact, they sounded really terrible at times, because I couldn't understand a lot of their songs. Maybe they should had sang some German songs too?

The movie also tried to make a new love interest with a new Fresh Bella and an another Troublemaker. She is known as a Legacy because her mom before her was a Bella and she automatically had the only way into becoming a new Bella for the group. Since, the start of the movie, the Bella had a banning for no new recruits, but as a Legacy, she can become one as it is claim as a loophole. Now the new love interest is set up as the old love interest with Becca and Jessie isn't really there anymore.

Yes, Becca and Jessie is still together, but their love is more like BF and GF been together for 3 years now, I would say. So, we really don't see them ""together"" as much, even if they were in the same room. In fact, most of the time, they are doing their own thing off screen from away from each other. lol

Another thing, you will be seeing will be a old flame being set up for a possible new relationship with Bummer and Fat Amy. These two have been tangoing around since the first movie and in this movie there no less of it. But, now will they move on from their flings and one nighters to a real solid relationship? That were it seems to be going for them, is used as the second love interest in this movie.

The movie really tried to do a lot of things as another part to this movie was Becca trying to move on from college life and getting the other Bellas to move on as well. So now, Becca is trying to go for her dream by working as an intern at a music company. She  still looking to produce music, but the thing is, she gets her shot at it, but it turns out, what she thought she was good at, mixing music together to do Mashups was not really good for becoming a music producer. It seems anyone at the company can do that stuff, so Becca has to do what is really not her talent, which is create something new an original song. Now, all this bring us back to the Legacy and her skills, which is, she is great at making original songs!

Now that all this movie has set up piece by piece up, it comes down to the world championships. The Bellas must win or be gone forever and so they must become what they once was and that is be amazing at winning. They will do this with Becca and the Legacy amazing talent, skills, and original song!

In the end, I thought this movie really had something going. It just the way the movie was made and failed to execute what they wanted to do in making a better sequel. The movie is still a great movie. Let me say that again. This is a GREAT MOVIE! In no way shape or form am I saying this is a bad movie. In fact, if you love the first movie, then you NEED to see this movie. You'll love it!!!  All I'm saying for this movie is that, it wasn't as good as the first movie. They had everything going for them story wise, but the first movie just had this one beat. Nothing can really capture the waves of laughter, and tears, excitement that the first movie did and done. They did a great job and I would pay to see another installment.",1431820800,4,5545,4.196244131455399
6685825,3,B00NYC3S78,"Pitch Perfect was a true underdog story back in 2012. The unexpected hit comedy hit during the peak of the Glee phenomenon, but was largely promoted by online campaigns and word-of-mouth, inspiring not only a best-selling soundtrack but a wave of sing-a-long screenings. It's a fun, spirited college romp in the mold of Bring ItOn; the outsiders must come together to win when everyone says they can't. So what's left to do for the eagerly-anticipated sequel?  Not much, apparently. While funny at times and those crazy Barden Bellas still cool to hang out with, Pitch Perfect 2 is like a perfectly decent cover version of its predecessor.

Pitch Perfect 2 isn't terrible or anything like that; if you dig the mash-ups of modern day hits and a few old school jams (they actually dropped A Tribe Called Quest's ""Scenario""!!!!), you'll find it's impossible not to singalong with the Bellas.  The problem is that it doesn't do anything particularly new. The characters, who we still love, are in the same place they were before, and the stakes are artificially ""higher"". Rather than merely winning the university's championship, now it's the A Capella World Championship. The challenge is bigger, but everything else is all-too familiar. It's a common issue with sequels, and frankly it doesn't matter whether it's this or a massive blockbuster like Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Elizabeth Banks pulls double-duty this time, making her directorial debut while returning as half of the snarky commentating duo alongside John Michael Higgins. They're present when the 3-time champion Bellas suffer an epic humiliation, in front of Barack and Michelle Obama no less, which becomes a national scandal. That's what happens when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) tears her too-tight clothing on a day when she's chosen to go commando. But it leaves a black mark on the entire ""sport"", and the Bellas are suspended from competition. The only way to get reinstated is to win the world championships which, you guessed it; no American a capella group has ever been able to do. Meanwhile, the senior Bellas must also prepare for life after college. Beca (Anna Kendrick) has taken an internship at a record studio where her boss (Keegan-Michael Key) is a complete lunatic. That she's looking forward while the other girls are focused on the championships causes a rift in the squad that may not be repaired. If there's any hope it will come from the group's newest member, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), an eager newcomer whose mother (Katey Sagal, in a small but effective role) was once a legendary Bella. Emily shares Beca's talent for songwriting but lacks her cynicism, which has only gotten worse with age.

Penned by Kay Cannon (who wrote the original), Pitch Perfect 2 has both too much going on and not enough. There are subplots dangled everywhere, many of them slight variations on stuff we've already seen. Fat Amy and the obnoxious Bumper (Adam Devine) continue their awkward flirtation; and Emily's journey is basically a less interesting copy of what Beca went through before. She gets a chance at love with the Treblemakers' resident magician, Benji (Ben Platt), and must learn to find her own voice. The humor is definitely more mean-spirited this time around, too, and simply doesn't connect the way it did before. Was Higgins' commentator character as viciously mean, racist and sexist last time? One Bella, who happens to be an illegal immigrant, jokes that she'll probably die trying to break back into the country. Why is that funny? Even Fat Amy's zingers don't quite have the same ""zing"". There's a desperation to the jokes this time around wasn't there before. Worse, the sense of companionship between the Bellas just isn't there, and that has always been the film's strongest asset, not the songs. Individually, the ladies fall into their roles without much variation. Hana Mae Lee is back as the quiet Asian with the disturbing non sequiturs; Alexis Knapp's character is still slutty (but much quieter this time), and so forth. Steinfeld is a solid actress with a lot of musical talent (she showed a little bit of it in Begin Again last year) but she's not yet ready to carry Pitch Perfect on her shoulders, assuming that is the plan

There are plenty of other times when the film hits just the right comedic tune, and they tend to be the big sing-off scenes. Banks shows real talents for comedic staging in a raucous battle at the home of the worlds #1 a capella fan (David Cross). Not only does it feature the surprisingly harmonic Green Bay Packers, but the Bellas' top rivals, the deathly-serious Germans known as Das Sound Machine. Their leader is so beautiful Beca can't bear to insult her: ""Your sweat smells like cinnamon! she weakly retorts. The German squad, who Fat Amy cleverly dubs ""Deutchbags"", are hilariously evil and worthy of their own spinoff. Pitch Perfect Drei, maybe?

Pitch Perfect 2 isn't going to win any points for originality, and its ""girl power"" message is basically just background noise now, but it's hard to completely hate the Barden Bellas no matter how far off-key they may be.",1431648000,54,5106,4.944055944055944
6685826,4,B00NYC3S78,"Whats it about?

Our favourite plucky female a capella group is back! But are they looking to life after college or maintaining their now-established high standards? A suspension following a wardrobe malfunction may acca-lerate their fate.

What did I think?

Generally, sequels develop the depth of characterization but the follow-up to the delightful Pitch Perfect chooses to instead make the characters more two-dimensional. Oddly it works. What do we get? A dumbing down of Beca (the lovely Ana Kendrick) and Chloe (Brittany Snow). More Fat Amy and more Lilly (Hana Mae Lees kooky Korean). Political incorrectness galore. More songs. A bigger (and better) riff-off. Over the top jokes that range from sly to outright sexist and racist. On paper, it sounds a bad idea but in the theater it was toe-tapping and almost non-stop LOLling. And I mean actually laughing out loud even as your mind is scolding you for laughing at the highly inappropriate one liners. With wonderful singing, genuine laughs and a savvy approach to directly appealing to its target demographic, PP2 will be met with acca-citement from the fanbase. As I left the preview screening, dozens of teenage girls were already animatedly talking about plans to see it again when it is released later this week.",1430870400,2,1278,5.105263157894737

6686143,3,B00NYC3S78,The first one is definitely hands down better.  A lot more singing and competition than this one.  Kind of a very very far fetched concept of the Bellas getting kicked out of acapella competitions----but then again it is a movie!,1518048000,,229,4.7

The cameos were so plentiful, it was almost a parody of cameos. (I did get emotional with the unexpected Barack and Michelle appearance, was not ready for that). The German group was hilarious. If I wrote it, Amy would get together with the German guy, and there would be more Esther Dean all the time.",1516752000,,449,4.172413793103448

That being said, despite the all-star guest ... stars... the movie was underwhelming and quite frankly a tad soulless. For all the vim and verve and showmanship, the storyline lacked heart. Also. the acapella is just subpar. That being said, if you freaking adored the first one, you'll probably think this is about 3 stars.",1515974400,,389,4.557142857142857

8681096,5,B00NYC3S78,"This sequel is very much fun to watch for me. The Music is great and the story is ok (anyway, the story is around the music). I really enjoyed the new twists and the riff-offs with bands using instruments; the sounds and songs are great. If you love Pitch Perfect 1 or 2, you very likely will enjoy this one too. Critics probably rate it lower as the story is nice but unconvincing; to me, it is pure fun and I will enjoy watching and listening to it many times (as I already have). Just consider the 'that's way too much cardio' when Fat Amy completes her action movie insert on her father's yacht. Many laughs and even more fun with the songs. Can't wait for a sequel, hopefully  it happens.",1533772800,,693,4.290076335877862
