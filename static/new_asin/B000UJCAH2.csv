Lots of silliness and good for a bunch of laughs, especially if you like low budget movies.  Don't forget to listen to the song lyrics.  The fashion announcer may teach you some new words like ""somnambulist"", and watch the ending credits after the dog plays the piano.  My favorite scene is the diner scene.  And of course Lorraine Masterson does a great job as Awesome Lotus.  There are a lot of goofy characters.

8213446,5,B000UJCAH2,"Amazing, steller, I loved it! Great characters and gags. This cinematic trash-terpiece has a good cast, and is just a well done, goofy and hilarious '80s B movie",1511568000,,161,4.785714285714286
8213447,3,B000UJCAH2,"Oy, this is one oddball of a movie! I saw about half of it many, many years ago and remembered some of the scenes. Seeing it again now, it's not as funny as I remembered but still worth checking out. If you like crazy comedies that don't take themselves seriously (e.g. ""Airplane""), chances are you will enjoy this one!",1218153600,5,319,4.423728813559322
