607721,2,6303257461,"Oh, has Ken Burns raised the standard to soaring new levels on historic documentaries!  I sent away for his ""Ken Burns Presents The West"" and received this set by mistake. Before realizing it, I'd begun watching with eager anticipation, only to realize the mistake and was floored by realization how there can exist a gap of veritable light years between the Burns' inspired, fine-honed creations and those of other documentary producers' creations.

This History Channel set, while indeed having great historic photos and informed historians sharing their storehouses of knowledge, feels disjointed and haphazard. Host Kenny Rogers - talking to us in front of a staged old west scene with hand on pistol (as if ready to plug the cameraman for challenging his space)woodenly introduces and summarizing the five, one-hour themes. If one can get past the hokum, sappy music, and - compared to Burns efforts - sloppy production values, there are some interesting facts and great photos to be gleaned.",1209513600,6,997,5.186335403726708

7841886,4,6303257461,Bought this to replace a VCR box set by the same name - it proved incomplete containing on 3 of the four VCR taped episodes.  A little disappointed that full disclosure by the manufacture of this fact wasn't clear but overall was am happy with the CD set,1456876800,,254,4.291666666666667
7841887,4,6303257461,Great DVD,1449273600,,9,4.0
7841888,3,6303257461,I found on this DVD you only get a few episodes and it's not clear enough in the description to tell you which one's they are..,1430092800,,127,3.923076923076923
7841889,5,6303257461,It came in excellent condition. The truth is always changing from one generation to another. The REAL WEST has been the best true and factual history of what really happened,1394928000,2,173,4.8
7841890,3,6303257461,"While I loved the history, the VHS tape had a tracking problem. The screen would go blank and you would have wavy lines up and down and then it would start again.",1378857600,,162,4.09375
7841891,5,6303257461,"It conveys a true feeling of the days long gone. One is tempted to turn the clock back. Despite certain shortcomings, the American was a free American.",1378252800,,151,4.62962962962963
7841892,5,6303257461,"This well written and artfully done series has a particular  appeal to me as a lifelong transplant from the Detroit area to the high prairie of northern Colorado (with the mountains on the distant horizon where they belong).

  From the opening introduction which combines stunning photography with sweeping music and presentient speech by Sitting Bull to the closing notes of the theme is a cohesive accurate representation of times long past.

  To someone who feels a creeping claustrophobia away from places where one can see from horizon to horizon, the opening alone is enough to put shivers down my spine and mirrors emotions i've long felt for my adopted country and the grandeur of vast open spaces .

  The montage of photographs and photography , combined with the informative  thought full narration of Kenny Rogers draws the watcher in to spend an hour in a time now gone forever, reluctantly returning to the present - refreshed thought full and inspired.

I have nothing but praise for this fine series and only wish I could see more like it on any topic. The narration of Mr. Rogers makes me unable to imagine anyone else - This series is a gem.",1353196800,5,1161,4.778894472361809
7841893,5,6303257461,"I watched these years ago about 20 to be exact and and I enjoyed them immensly back then. I believe that there were many more broadcast that are not on DVD, and would hope that someday they might all be offered to the public. The people that commented about the subjects on the programs were all American
West experts and their commentary helped make the show come alive. The photography was quite beautiful and the musical score seemed to fit the vast expanse
of the 19th Century West. I would like to have all 70 if someone would take the time, trouble, and labor to put them all on DVD. Terry",1338422400,8,595,4.36936936936937
7841894,5,6303257461,I got these for my husband who is a history teacher here in Texas in a small rual area. He thinks these portray the times and people accurately enough to show the students . He also can rest assured there is nothing inappropriate for his kids. He is not just a teacher of history but a student of it as well. I do not think he would have ordered with having seen on TV first. He's a hard customer to please re: history and how it it is depicted. This had to be good or else!,1330214400,5,474,3.9479166666666665
