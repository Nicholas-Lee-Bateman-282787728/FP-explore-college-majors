7723936,4,B01DT59KFI,Fascinating but a bit hard to follow at times. Great acting & true staging of many documented events. Would be great in a movie.,1501200000,,128,4.375
7723937,3,B01DT59KFI,"While this series does an excellent job of showing the horrors of slavery,
the desperate effoirts it took to escape it, and the courage of the
Underground workers, it has one serious flaw - almost all the characters, Black or
White, are looking out only for number one, almost all act on selfish motivations.
But there were Black leaders back then who had the same type of personality
as an Ellington or a Coltrane - strong smart leaders, but with a real concern for others.
I have seen only Season I, and Wikipedia tells me that Harriet Tubman appears in
Season 2, but there were other decent, even noble leaders on the King-Ellington model:
it would have been nice  - and more historically accurate - to have at least one character like that here.
  Similarly, the only preachers shown (in the first season at least) are hypocrites or fools.
Yet religion played a big role in the Underground: it was a motivator for many escaping slaves,
and the vast majority of the White 'conductors' were Evangelicals or Quakers: check out
John Brown, for instance: a Bible in one hand, a rifle in the other.
  Another problem I had was with the music:  instead of using music of the time,
all dance scenes are accompanied by modern (21st century) pop styles.  Most
Southern plantations at the time used slave orchestras, and the Black fiddler was
a major figure in the creation of jazz and that could have been shown here, instead of
the truly vapid pop selections which destroy the historical ambiance for that mioment.
  Still, this series does show the true horrors of slavery, more so even than Roots,
and deserves credit and watching  for that.",1500940800,,1638,4.695804195804196

7723943,5,B01DT59KFI,"OMG!! I'll be the first to say that I was one of the last ones to get on the boat to watch this series.  As an African American, I'm sensitive about sitting down and watching things about slavery because I never want it watered down or told from a perspective that is non representative of what really happened.  This series however has somehow told the truth in a way that is informative and entertaining.  I never thought that could be done.  It's a great series that doesn't take away from history.  Wow!!! Shame on whoever cancelled this show!! I love it!!! I wish I would have started to watch it earlier to support such a great and brace cast.  Standing ovation to everyone of them.

From the overseer to the mister and madam of the Big House. It's even told from the slave catcher and the children of the slaves point of view! Get your snacks ready, turn the TV up and be ready to be sitting on the edge of your chair for ALL 10 episodes!! I'm excitedly waiting for season 2 so that I may purchase it as well.

7724030,5,B01DT59KFI,I enjoyed watching Underground from the beginning to the end.  I can not wait to see what season 2 will bring.,1466726400,4,110,4.238095238095238
7724031,3,B01DT59KFI,"This new television series has great writing, great acting and seems to be very accurate for the period But! I don't know why the creators feel that they have to ""make a statement"" for their viewers by putting Hip-Hop and other modern rock music behind many of the scenes. Seeing the beautiful ""Great House"" of the owners of the plantation having a social gathering and dancing is one thing but the music they back the scenes with is jarring and jolts me right out of the story! I actually fast forwarded to get through those scenes that were so off kilter because of the music. I also wondered why one of the characters was wearing a more modern ball down-another thing that took me out of the drama! (watching the extras- they did that on purpose just like the hip hop music, sheesh!)  The soulful Negro spirituals and theme song are really well done and appropriate, too bad the creators were not consistent with music choices!

It really is too bad that the creators seem to care more about their own statement to the world, then drawing their viewers into this story. It is an important time in history to tell now since Roots was made a very long time ago I just wish they cared more about an important story in our history, then seemingly their own agenda of ""modernizing it"" with hip-hop music. I doubt I'll be watching season two and that's too bad because the actors and the writers did a wonderful job with season one.",1466640000,7,1429,4.513513513513513
7724032,5,B01DT59KFI,Great series. Can't wait for the next season,1466294400,,44,4.625
7724033,5,B01DT59KFI,"ok, so I know I'm late in watching this series, but that's only because I had recorded all of the episodes so that I could binge watch and then life got in the way so I'm just getting the chance to watch them......OH MY GOD, this series was soooo good!!  I was totally not expecting it to be so good. I couldn't stop watching it or talking about it with my co-workers.  I'm so excited for the entire cast, writers, producers, crew, etc...these guys put on a spectacular series. I feel like they were all destined to create something that has never been done with so much finesse and class. I experienced so many different emotions while watching; I was sad, excited, proud, and lastly in awe of how well this series was written. I can only imagine what being in a room of such talented people would be like. The cast....AWESOME!  2017 seems so far away so I'll just watch this first season over and over while anxiously awaiting season 2....I look forward to being wowed",1465948800,,970,4.468926553672317

7724036,5,B01DT59KFI,"I'm a huge television fan & I must say that this is the best series I've ever seen. For me, Underground tops them all. The subject matter alone is jarring, but the writing, the direction & the pace! My God, you truly relate to these characters and their desperate plight to obtain something most of us take for granted today - simple freedom. The pace of the show gives you an example of the life and death timing that was at stake. When you watch this show, you will truly realize how those who came before us fought like hell, bled and often died for the very freedom we enjoy today. The performances from all of the cast, especially Jurnee Smollett, Aldis Hodge, Christopher Meloni, Amirah Vann, Jessica De Gouw, Reed Diamond, Marc Blucas and so many others - will leave you speechless.

If you are an American - you must watch Underground. For anyone else who loves Liberty & freedom regardless of your nationality - you too must watch!

This is the only show ever that literally made me shout back at my television. I've never done that - ever:)",1465689600,28,1050,4.492146596858639
7724037,5,B01DT59KFI,"I truly don't think I've ever seen ANYTHING on Amazon that had perfect ratings. But boy, does this show deserve it. Underground is one of the best written and acted shows I've ever seen. It's definitely the best show on TV today. All the characters are human and feel very genuine. Within 30 seconds of turning this show on for the first time I was seriously invested in the character on screen! Definitely a show made for binge watching. The music is amazing and it's also the only period piece show/movie that has used modern music without it looking and sounding ridiculous. Underground is a good balance of emotion, excitement, history, human strength, weakness cruelty, kindness, bravery and occasionally some allegories for today's society. I really can't say enough about this show. Go watch it today!",1465516800,2,808,4.948529411764706
7724038,5,B01DT59KFI,"A landmark in American television: the first time the story of the Underground Railroad has been told on a scripted series. But it's also an action filled and thoroughly exciting show that follows a group of enslaved people escaping to freedom and that explores the psychological violence of slaver. It's a thriller, it's history, and it has a lot to say about our culture today. I think of it as ""Roots"" meets ""Oceans 11""",1465516800,2,422,4.716216216216216
7724039,3,B01DT59KFI,"I'm into 4th episode now and so far it's great! Only negative is the producer's extremely bad decision to put a post 2000 pop song with a horrible female singer's voice right on top of a 1850s posh slave owner dance party? Huh? This almost made me give up on this series! Why would anyone put a techno sounding pop song in an 1800s theme tv drama? The time period of music, the music genre, and the female singer's voice sucked to boot! Bad bad decision fellas! The 1800s slave songs sound excellent. Note to producers: Try watching Hell on Wheels and follow their lead. They always make the music (even the songs w/ modern electric guitars and drums) at least sound like it's from the 1800s. Wake up guys if you want this show to be Emmy material.
UPDATE: Sad to report that the writing is lack luster and paint by numbers in this TV series. After 3-4 episodes I could not bare to watch it anymore. Reminds me of 1970s paint by numbers writing. The acting is good but this series is mediocre average blah.",1465257600,,1006,4.385026737967914
7724040,5,B01DT59KFI,Love the story line. Dialogue is softer than the music. Very irritating.,1464566400,,72,5.083333333333333
7724041,5,B01DT59KFI,Every episode was absolutely breathtaking!!! So much so that I watched every episode live and its encore presentation immediately following. The show is not only historically accurate but it's told from a point of view that is often rarely shared. Entertaining doesn't begin to describe this series. The music sails the show along with a cast that is beyond perfect.. If you haven't seen this you need to... I'm sure you won't be disappointed...,1464393600,,445,5.027027027027027

7724043,5,B01DT59KFI,"This show is what it would look like if Baz Luhrrman and JJ Abrams had a concept baby. Exciting and unexpected, with every character, imbued with their own agency, falling along a spectrum of morality rather than the cliche extremes these stories are often told in (totally right, totally wrong, total villain, total victim).",1463270400,,325,5.037037037037037
7724044,5,B01DT59KFI,"I have been waiting for some form of media that dealt the with subject of slavery like a genre instead of a slog of a history lesson that you have to endure with the enslaved people.

FINALLY. This is it!

It's no less weighty and harrowing, but full of twists and turns and the number one thing you watch TV for, to be engrossed and entertained.  The show starts with the set-up and only gets better with each episode culminating in a very satisfying season finale. The performances are top notch, with Christopher Meloni, Johnny Ray Gill, and Amirah Vann as particular stand-outs.

Underground is setting trends.  It is the next big thing and thankfully it has already been renewed.  Hop on the Underground Railroad.  You will not regret it!",1463097600,7,743,4.6692307692307695
7724045,5,B01DT59KFI,"Just watched the series on television.  This show is:
1. Perfectly written
2. Has the very best actors in it
3. Takes you on a journey through the south, slavery, desperation, hope and pain unlike anything you've ever seen
4. Features beautiful costumes

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- It offers innovative music that occasionally jars you back into the current day then brings you back in time.

- Will help you understand where so much pain today actually comes from and why it is crucial to educate yourself on the history of many people, and how it can affect their lives, attitudes and emotions today and offer an opportunity to grow yourself about how we must treat one another as human beings if we hope to create a better future for ourselves and the generations to come.

- The season finale really occurs at the very end of the show, when the word UNDERGROUND appears on the screen, then one last scene is featured right after the word fades away.  It will blow your mind and wake you up.

Buy it for birthday and Christmas gifts - it's better than flowers.

Talk about it with your family and friends - they need to know about this show.

Support it on social media and vote for it on IMDB by rating every single episode so that the producers continue to finance this series annually.

And lastly, remember that we are all one here - what we do to others, we have done to ourselves.  Treat each other the way you want to be treated and the world will be a better place for us all.  That is the lesson here and it can never be taught enough.

You do not need to be a minority to watch this show.  You only need to be a human being who wants to be enlightened, inspired and feel more love, compassion, empathy and hope in your own life.",1463097600,36,1734,4.3478260869565215

The cast is so talented and much thanks to every person involved in the creation of this television show. It isn't your traditional storyline about slavery which is awesome! Underground is like a tasteful gumbo composed of action, suspense, romance, raw talented actors, unapologetic, happy moments, tragic moments, love, compassion, revenge, sacrifice, wisdom, courage, strength, integrity, smart, witty, and charming. I want to purchase a blu ray version, hopefully this will be an option. Music in the show is a plus too!",1462924800,17,702,5.276785714285714
