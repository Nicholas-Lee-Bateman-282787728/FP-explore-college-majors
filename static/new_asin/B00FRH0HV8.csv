6028456,4,B00FRH0HV8,"Cons:  Interlaced, and non-anamorphic.  Which is crazy for a 2014 release, but there aren't exactly a lot of options to choose from.  Other than that, the quality is pretty decent.

On the other hand, I love this movie.  It's the movie that made me fall in love with Chor Yuen's style.  It's a very solemn movie, and it feels more like a samurai film than a swordplay/wuxia flick.  There are some twists, but not to the degree of some of his other films.  The fights are pretty good, and there's plenty of them, but this movie is more about the time spent not fighting.  It's a beautiful looking film and the ending is fantastic.",1405468800,5,629,4.447368421052632

6028458,4,B00FRH0HV8,"I also love watching Chinese and Japanese action movies. However, I do not know the title of many of the ones I wish to purchase.",1403654400,,129,4.2
6028459,4,B00FRH0HV8,"Yet another ""swordsman trying to leave his past behind"" movie, and...yet another good one. It amazes me how often the Shaw Brothers studios went back to that well, and how sweet and cool it often was.

Derek Yee made himself a name with this one. He manages to pull off both the Sad, Lonely Boy and the Incredible Badass as the film demands - he has an innately noble (all that word entails) quality to him that's perfect for this film. While full of twists and plotting, this one's downbeat - don't expect the dour but rollicking feeling of, say, THE MAGIC BLADE. It's almost goth - plenty of bloodletting, darkness in the hero's soul, and no happy endings. I mentioned ...BLADE, and we get a cameo from Ti Lung as the now-retired swordsman Fu Hung Xue, as well as one from Lo Lieh as his amazing Han Tang from KILLER CLANS. A quick, strange cameo from David Chiang is almost jarring enough to mess up the flow of the movie, but it's over so quickly that it just helps hammer home the senselessness of all the killing.

It's about typical Well Go quality :/ But the movie is great.",1401494400,6,1082,4.405

8618271,4,B00FRH0HV8,"The Third Master ( Derek Yee, in the role that launched his career) is considered to be the greatest swordmaster of the day. His displays of skill and strength bring armies of challengers to his door, seeking the title for themselves. Not to be defeated, the Third Master fights evil. Totally love this movie and totally love the fight scenes. Once again the Shaw Brothers bring us a great knock down drag out fight movie. Loved it, loved the story and loved all the performers.",1509580800,,478,4.635294117647059
