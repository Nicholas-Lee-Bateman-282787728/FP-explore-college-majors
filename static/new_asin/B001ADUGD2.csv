8277179,5,B001ADUGD2,"I cannot get enough of watching this concert, and every time I see it I catch something new I didn't see the 1st time. It's just mind blowing with all the details and non- stop entertainment.  It's true that the last part of the DVD ""Yeah"" should have been put on DVD 2 then making a last DVD. Funny I was so caught up in the main concert on DVD 2 I didn't even watch the last DVD until the next day because I thought it would be as boring as the 1st DVD.  My suggesting go right to DVD 2, and yes you do have to pop in 3 for the last and best part of the concert. Then when you're bored sit down and watch DVD 1 and rest of DVD 3. It had a lot of insight on it. I like the sit down with Usher and his Mom it gives great insight into their relationship as mother and son if you're interested. Then on his summer camp how Usher and his mom sponsors unprivileged kids every summer. So to me that's interesting if you're a fan and like to know more detailed in to what else is up with Usher. Last on some reviews people speak on Usher not doing enough singing - well yeah the boy got to breathe he's only human but he can dance his ass off so it does make up for the in between times he lets the audience sing for him. Me personally I can watch that young man dance all day long.
I see that this Truth Tour concert is now being sold on Amazon for $45.77 as new. I had to go back and check to see what I paid because I didn't remember paying that much. I brought this DVD this year in Feb off Amazon site for $19.97 - New - Sold by: -importcds  - I can't wait for his next concert to come out on DVD cause I sure cannot afford to see him up front in concert, and wouldn't waste my time or money for some way back seats 2 watch him on video cam. So yes up front in front of my TV set is fine with me.",1304121600,,1795,3.7813333333333334
8277180,4,B001ADUGD2,This video was great - the only problem is that Yeah! was filmed on another disc which was kinda crazy that you have to watch another disc for the last song of the concert.  I would still recommend this video to any Usher fan.,1295049600,,226,4.136363636363637
