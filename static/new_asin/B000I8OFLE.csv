8144522,5,B000I8OFLE,"I usually am very skeptical of modernized stagings of Mozart's operas, as I find the 18th c. atmosphere simply essential to the work, both in costumes, decors and behaviors. And reconstituting an 18th c. period staging is costly in terms of costumes and scenery. Most modern opera houses don't have the vast financial resources to go authentic, and prefer to modernize with simpler and cheaper productions. The results can be bizarre, even ludicrous.

The Salzburg Festival usually can't afford period stagings and goes for the ""modern"" style. I was very cautious about the M-22 DVDs of the 2006 Festival which presented the complete collection of Mozart's operas, in itself a most remarkable and laudable achievement. It's high time to present to the world-wide public all the other operas of Mozart besides the 5 iconic ones.

I bought a few individual boxes, including this ""Il Re Pastore"". For once, I got lucky, because I found this ultra-modern production an adorable tour-de-force. But I must warn readers that already knowing this opera in advance does help to appreciate this very peculiar M-22 version. And this is an opera that very few people know at all. So the impression from a first-time exposure to ""Il Re Pastore"" through the M-22 DVD must be completely different from mine.

This is a charming, simple libretto. The crux of the plot is the very classical dilemma that excited aristocrats of the 17th and 18th c. in Europe: passion vs duty.
In this opera the action is all psychological. There is no physical violence, nor any accidents.
The emotional crises are played out in a simple, minimal, but effective decor. The stage is made to look designed for life-size marionettes with simply stylized costumes, mostly in black and white against a background of pale azure.
A curtain can close the marionette stage. In front of the curtain is an ""avant-scene"" where the same actors move around, but as real-time actors dressed in casual modern style.
I am amused every time the actors seem keen on undressing. Here we go again! But they remain at least in T-shirts (the bane of modern interpretations of opera, because they're such cheap costumes), but don't go down to underwear or nudity, which is usually overdone for shock effect in modern stagings.

The staging is thus reduced to simple life-size marionettes and the scenery to silhouettes and simple drawings on the back wall -- supposed to suggest green meadows, white sheep, and the soldiers of Alessandro's army. Without an advance knowledge of the libretto, the action must remain a bit mysterious to a first-time spectator, who has no concrete signposts or physical events to help him follow the plot . Again, it pays to already know the story intimately to be able to appreciate this modernistic staging, with its tasteful but purified and abstract concept.

Fortunately the cast includes very beautiful voices:
- First of all, of Annette Dasch, the mezzo soprano singing the soprano castrato's role of Aminta, the shepherd king. Her famous No. 10 aria ""L'amero, saro costante"" is sublimely moving and charming. She is an energetic, electric presence throughout.
- Equally outstanding is Marlis Petersen as Elisa, gifted with a superb soprano voice. She is a perfect pendant to the bubbling Annette Dasch. Their lovely duet at end of Act I, No. 7 Duetto : ""Vanne a regnar ben mio"", is a sure winner.
- Arpine Rahdjian is strong-voiced and convincing as Tamiri.
Both men are tall and dominant.
- Andreas Karasiak gives a solid interpretation of Agenore, though his occasional roughness is not in the libretto.
- And Kresimir Spicer as Alessandro does look imperial, but does not sound imperial enough. Again, in those kingly roles I always miss the voice of Gsta Winbergh, the powerful Mitridate of Ponnelle's DVD.
- Engelbrock deserves recognition as he conveys the energy of Mozart's music in his conducting, while he is also responsible for the imaginative and charming staging .
Gott sei Dank, all the arias have been preserved, and some recitatives include a bit more text than in Harnoncourt's 1995 CD.

EXCITING, ENERGIZING MUSIC WITH ALL THE FRESHNESS AND IMPETUOSITY OF YOUTH

The piece was commissioned by the Salzburg Archbishop Colloredo, who was Mozart's ""bte noire"", for a court celebration in Salzburg of a visit from Vienna by the young archduke Maximilian, the youngest son of the Empress Maria Theresa, who was 19 years old, the same age as Mozart. Mozart was given six weeks to write this opera, which was presented on April 23, 1775 as a ""serenade"" or ""cantata,"" which meant at the time that it was partly staged and partly sung in concert form.

In truth, I find the music in ""Il Re Pastore"" enchanting from beginning to end. There are so many magnificent arias in this short opera (1h 52'). It is hard to give justice to them all.
- The energetic overture is a thrilling appeal to the joy of living that only a young composer could feel and express.
- Which leads directly into Aminta's No. 1 Aria : ""Intendo amico rio"", conversing with the stream, and Elisa's No. 2 Aria : ""Alla selva, al prato, al fonte"", singing the joys of the natural and simple life of being in love.
- And their astonishingly beautiful No. 7 Duetto : ""Vanne a regnar ben mio"" sings of the tender and reassuring (even if idealized) faithfulness of lovers in tones that are so far away from the grandiose atmosphere of ""Mitridate"" or ""Lucio Silla"".
- Alessandro's great No. 9 Aria : ""Se vincendo vi rendo felici"" has exciting and powerful music, with amazing orchestral interjections.
- Notable is the No. 10 Rondo, ""L'amero, saro costante"" (Aminta), dedicated to imperishable love, one of the most exquisite arias ever composed by Mozart.
- Equally effective is the following No. 11 Aria (also a rondo) : ""Se tu di me fai dono"" (Tamiri), reproaching Agenore for his fickleness, and accusing him of giving her away.
- Which elicits Agenore's noble No. 12 Aria : ""Sol puo dir come si trova"", in a dark C Minor, describing his emotional torment at Alessandro's irresponsibly cruel decision to have Tamiri become the bride of the new king Aminta.

We will not find such delicate and spontaneous outpourings of fragile emotional passion in later works. It is because Mozart was able at 19 to produce such sensationally beautiful music that this opera is worth the attention and affection of any serious Mozart lover and its place in any complete library of his operas.

Modern conductors, as a rule, do not hesitate to make some deep but intelligent cuts in the recitatives of these early Mozart opera recordings, and, alas, occasionally of the arias as well, but fortunately, not in this Salzburg M-22 staging. This trimming helps produce vigorous and energetic performances, which must be supported by the highest quality of singers, absolutely essential if the conductor wants to capture the youthful energy, freshness and extraordinary beauty of young Mozart's opera music.

Mozart's scope of melodic inventiveness in ""Il Re Pastore"" is extraordinary, and worth investigating in depth. The orchestra is untiringly hyperactive in its independent role of commentator, questioner of the feelings expressed by the singers. Mozart ""takes an evident delight in virtuosic orchestral effects"", says Hermann Abert.

Mozart's so-called ""early music"", written before he left Salzburg for good in 1781 at the age of 25 has the appeal of the freshness of youth. The tremendous, unabating, energy of the young Mozart, his adolescent yearning for a dreamy world of beauty and love are deeply rooted in the spirit of the great decade of the 1770's when Mozart was still relatively free of cares, before he moved to Vienna and had to cope with the problems of surviving on his own and taking care of his personal and musical needs in the real world of adults.
[Which is what pushed him, most wisely, when he settled in Vienna, to get married as soon as possible and gain the daily assistance and comfort from a wife. Luck paired him with a young woman from an impoverished family of singers, Constanze Weber, with no social standing or money -- to Leopold's distress, who had always dreamt of a glorious marriage and a prestigious position as a court opera composer for his miraculously gifted son.]

This is such lovely music that one can easily watch this DVD many times. I cannot tire of this music, but of course I am an addict of young Mozart's opera music which I find irresistibly seductive in a totally different way from the later operas of the 1780's where virility, strength and grandeur become more assertive, but where the charm of youth is no longer present.
I am a strong proponent that Mozart's Early Italian Operas are worth being included in the library of any Mozart fan and repeatedly enjoyed. There is superfine and original music in there that is not heard again in the later works of Mozart.

THE THEME OF THE ASCOT RACES IN ""MY FAIR LADY"" SEEMS BORROWED FROM THE OVERTURE OF ""IL RE PASTORE""

I am always struck by the fact that in the overture there's a phrase of a few bars that sounds eerily like the music for the Ascot race in My Fair Lady.
The composer of My Fair Lady, Frederick Lowe, was born in Vienna and was a kind of prodigy pianist there. He sure knew his young Mozart, and was obviously not averse to being influenced by him (Plagiarism? Copying? Gentle influence?). This is so reassuring, and a vindication that broadcasting my enthusiasm for young Mozart's music is not preaching in the wilderness, but that it is shared by real connoisseurs.

LIBRETTO -- UNDYING LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER ALESSANDRO'S THREAT TO DISRUPT THE RELATIONSHIPS OF TWO LOVING COUPLES

On the occasion of the state visit of April 1775 by 19-year old archduke Maximilian, the ""festa teatrale"" was meant to be a lighter piece, a ""serenata"", extolling the idealized life of shepherds and nymphs in a beautiful Arcadian countryside, in the dramatic pastoral genre made so popular by Rousseau in the 18th c.
This was a framework ready-made for extolling the elevated feelings of loyalty and constant love animating noble heroic characters in rustic surroundings -- the fictions favored by aristocrats, in which they fancied seeing a reflection of their world -- already encountered by Mozart in ""Ascanio in Alba"" (and to some extent, in ""Bastien und Bastienne"" K 50, (back in 1768).

Metastasio, based in Vienna, was the undisputed master of this genre. He had written the libretto of ""Il Re Pastore"" in 1751. It has been set to music 15 times in the 18th c., besides Mozart's version. Since its first performance in Salzburg in 1775, Mozart's work was never performed again until our times. This was nothing extraordinary. It was the fate of practically all operas in the 18th c. Once performed, they were forgotten for good, making place for new works. Opera lovers were always craving for new music. Mozart's version of the Metastasio libretto is the only one being currently revived and staged.

The libretto was written in the style of ""opera seria"", it was meant to reflect formal court manners, noble sentiments, and display spectacular coloratura virtuosity. The best singers of Europe were sought out and engaged for the performance.

The plot rests, in essence, on a simple dynamic. Two couples and a ""matre de jeu"" (game master) who, unwillingly, disturbs their relations and so creates the confusion that propels the action. Same principle will be at play in ""Cosi Fan Tutte."" There is no violence, nor accidents of fate in the story. The action is all psychological.

Alessandro the Great has conquered Sidon and pushed the tyrant Strato to suicide. Alessandro learns from Agenore, a noble of the court in Sidon, that the son of the previous ruler deposed by the tyrant is now living obscurely in the countryside as a shepherd, Aminta. Alessandro, with the help of Agenore, decides to find the hidden king.
Aminta has fallen in love with a Phoenician princess, Elisa, who is also living disguised as a shepherdess in the country. Her father has just given her permission to marry Aminta.

Alessandro, aided by Agenore, discovers Aminta, and first tests the nobility of his character before offering him the crown of Sidon. Aminta shows his fine metal, and accepts his new role of king. Alessandro decides that, to make things perfect, Aminta should marry Tamiri, the daughter of the former tyrant. This decision provokes general turmoil and distress among the two key couples, and sets off the dramatic explosion in the story.

For Tamiri is secretly in love with Agenore. Aminta, deeply affected by Elisa's wild reaction at being abandoned, renounces his new kingship to return to the shepherd life for the sake of his undying love to Elisa. Tamiri reveals her love for Agenore to Alessandro. Alessandro, in an act of imperial clemency, agrees to make everybody happy, and let the two couples unite.

NUMBERS & ARIAS

Fortunately, although Hengelbrock cut out the recitatives in a few scenes (but a little less than Harnoncourt did in 1995) he kept all the 14 numbers intact.
(Quotations on matters of style below come from Hermann Abert's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/W-A-MOZART/dp/0300072236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">W.A. MOZART</a>"", 1919, transl. 2007)

There's one duetto, Aminta/Elisa, at the end of Act I, and the Quintetto/Coro at the end of Act II.
The 12 arias are allocated as follows:
- Aminta 3 arias: No. 1, No. 3, No. 10
- Alessandro 3 arias: No. 4, No. 9, No. 13
- Elisa 2 arias: No. 2, No. 8
- Tamiri 2 arias: No. 6, No. 11
- Agenore, 2 arias: No. 5, No. 12

""The arias all adopt the modern, concentrated ternary form found in `Ascanio in Alba', the only novel feature being the two rondo arias"" -- No. 10 ""L'amero, saro costante"", and No. 11 ""Se tu di me fai dono"".
The autograph score runs to 284 pages.

ACT I

The overture in C major is in one movement. ""It ends with an entirely new and wonderfully tuneful melody that leads directly into the opening scene. It is otherwise unrelated to the drama.""

No. 1 Aria : ""Intendo amico rio"" (Aminta - ANN MURRAY)

[Sc. 1 introduces the bucolic atmosphere of the work. Aminta, sitting by a stream, in the distance, flocks and shepherds. He sings to the stream.]

""I hear your soft murmuring, asking me where is my love?""

[The orchestra answers him, playing the part of the murmuring stream.]

No. 2 Aria : ""Alla selva, al prato, al fonte"" (Elisa - EVA MEI)**

[Aminta warns Elisa that Alessandro's camp is nearby. Nothing to fear, Alessandro came to free Sidon from a tyrant, and now is refusing the throne. He is looking for the rightful heir, who is said to be living unknown somewhere. She says: ""I must to mother, then back to you and our happy life together.""]

""To the forest, meadow and spring, I'll go with my beloved shepherd. Under our simple roof, we'll find joy and happiness.""

[Elisa is a princess, and Aminta will be revealed as the heir to the throne of Sidon. Both royal personages intend to lead a rustic life surrounded by herds and beautiful nature. Elisa's aria expresses this naive, innocent, hope of a simple life.]

No. 3 Aria : ""Aer tranquillo e di sereni"" (Aminta)

[Alessandro and Agenore approach Aminta. Agenore already knows Aminta is the rightful heir to the throne, but has kept silent under the former tyrant. They offer Aminta an easier life than a shepherd's. Aminta refuses, stresses his love for Elisa and the simple life. While Amita declares his disinterest in the ""grandezze"" and ""onori"" for the charms of the tranquil life, Alessandro reads in his words a hidden nobility of aristocratic origin.]

""Soft and balmy air, fresh springs and green meadows are the blessings of the shepherd. If the gods wanted to change my life, they'd also have to change my mind and my heart.""

No. 4 Aria : ""Si spande al sole in faccia"" (Alessandro - ROBERTO SACCA)

[Alessandro is convinced that the nobility of Aminta's feelings confirms their suspicions that Aminta is the right man for the throne. Alessandro is a man of war and conquests, but also of compassion and justice, and dedicated to righting wrongs.]

""Clouds hide the face of the sun, with lightnings threatening the dry earth. But the thunder turns into rain, revitalizing its breast.""

[This is the heroic military aria of Alessandro. Trumpets, winds and brass give it the required bravura tone.]

No. 5 Aria : ""Per me rispondete"" (Agenore - MARKUS SCHAEFER)**

[Agenore is a courtly character, a friend of the former legitimate king, the father of Aminta. Agenore now meets his beloved princess Tamiri, in the dress of a shepherdess, the daughter of the tyrant Straton that Alessandro has just deposed and killed. Agenore has fallen in love with Tamiri. Why should she go with Agenore, who is Alessandro's aid and follower, the general who killed her father? Does Agenore still love her? She should ask her eyes.]

""Answer for me, beautiful stars of love. If you dont' know it, who will? You have known the ways of my heart, ever since you triumphed over my freedom.""

No. 6 Aria : ""Di tante sue procelle"" (Tamiri - INGA NIELSEN)

[The gods are not so cruel as Tamiri believed. They've changed her royal station into a hut, and her purple garments into gross linen. But she has not lost her lover, and that is enough.]

""From so many torments my soul has escaped, and found peace again with my lover. The angry stars did frighten me, but my heart keeps beating with joy.""

No. 7 Duetto : ""Vanne a regnar ben mio"" (Elisa, Aminta)**

[Elisa is overjoyed that her father gave her permission to marry Aminta. Agenore arrives, with kingly attendance and bringing royal emblems. He reveals to Amira that he is the son of the former king previously driven out by the tyrant Straton, and entrusted to the care of Agenore, who had to keep the secret until the time Aminta could be safely restored as king to his father's throne. The generous heart of Alessandro, ""il gran cor d'Alessandro"", has finally made it feasible.
Elisa is overjoyed. She had always sensed in her lover the heart of a king. She pushes Aminta to go with his destiny. Aminta promises to return to her as a king.]

""Go and reign, my love, but remain faithful to your lover -- Even on the throne, I shall remain your shepherd -- Oh gods, protect our innocent love.""

[The Act ends on a note of joy and hope, in spite of the apprehensions due to the unusual and uncertain situation. The duet ""with its heartfelt and rapt expression and Rococo ornamentation, is one of the opera's finest numbers.""]

ACT II

No. 8 Aria : ""Barbaro! oh Dio mi vedi"" (Elisa)**

[Elisa goes to Alessandro's camp looking for Aminta who has been crowned king. Agenore stops her and informs her she cannot hang around trying to see her king, who must remain in attendance to Alessandro. Agenore is an experienced courtier who knows the importance of formal court ceremonial in which natural sentiments are not acceptable.]

""Oh, monster! You separate me from my lover, and forbid me to see him? You cannot show compassion for this great love? Do you still have a heart? Do you still have a soul?""

No. 9 Aria : ""Se vincendo vi rendo felici"" (Alessandro)**

[Aminta has sighted Elisa fleeing after her aria No. 8 in sc. I. He wants to go after her. Agenore now dissuades him, Aminta's new royal duties oblige him to control his feelings. Alessandro appears, and wants Aminto to change into the royal dress needed for his anointment. Aminto wants to kneel to his benefactor, but Alessandro offers him a friendly embrace. But Aminta complains, he had learnt only to guide a herd, once Alessandro gone, who is going to advise him as the new king? Heaven is going to be his guide.
In the key sc. IV, Alessandro explains his plans to Agenore for the new king Aminta, ""Ma (te 'l confesso) a pieno, soddisfatto non parto."" Alessandro wants to leave a clean situation behind and feel ""contento a pieno"" when he departs. So he announces that Tamiri is going to marry the new king, ""Or s contento a pieno partir potr. Vola a Tamiri: e dille che oggi al nuovo sovrano io dar la corona, ella la mano."" This is the key decision that sets off the explosion in the plot. Agenore, visibly paling, does not dare to speak up, but cannot hide that the news is affecting him deeply. Self-satisfied, Alessandro goes into his big aria.]

""If through my victory, I make you happy, and I leave no enemies behind, what a great day is this for me. For all my sweats in battle, I cannot ask for more reward.""

[All the following action, in sc. V to X, where ""the usual confusions ensue"", as Abert says, everybody gets upset by this planned marriage of Aminta/Tamiri, believing that his or her happiness has been destroyed.]

No. 10 Rondo : ""L'amero, saro costante"" (Aminta)***

[Aminta is distressed by the obligations of his new position. Royal purple and gold are bringing him torments. To Agenore, he confirms his decision to go with his fate. Elisa and the throne cannot be linked. He will love his assigned wife, and cannot reign without her.]

""I will love her, I shall be constant. As a faithful husband, as a faithful lover I shall breathe only for her. In her fair presence, I'll find my joy, my pleasure, and my peace.""

[Aminta is apparently reassuring Agenore about his dutiful love for his future wife, ""fido sposo"", but at the same time he asserts his enduring affection as lover, ""fido amante"", which can be construed as his expressing his irreplaceable love for Elisa.
This is not clarified in the text, so that both interpretations are acceptable. It is not even clear, in this scene VI of Act II, that Aminta has already decided in his heart's depth that he is going to renounce the throne to remain faithful to his true love.

So, the aria remains ambiguous, and can be read as chiefly a celebration of the passion of true love that will remain constant. It becomes the high point of the opera, and is the longest, lasting 8'. It is in the form ABACA. ""It reveals a genuinely Mozartian blend of fire and graceful dreaminess."" Many phrases gain special power ""through the use of powerful contrasts"" or ""impassioned syncopations"" ]

No. 11 Aria (also a rondo) : ""Se tu di me fai dono"" (Tamiri)**

[Elisa complains about the news of the wedding to Agenore, who confirms that it comes from Aminta himself. Aminta cannot oppose Alessandro's will to whom he owes his throne. Elisa is astonished to be so betrayed by Aminta. She cannot accept her fate. She will beg for mercy from men and gods, and, if denied, she will die from grief, and Aminta will be a spectator of her death.
Agenore sympathizes with Elisa's grief, when Tamiri appears. Tamiri is unhappy, and blames the meek Agenore for not speaking up. She accuses Agenore of having given her away. She commands Agenore to be present at her planned wedding.]

""If you do give me away, that I belong to another one, why is this my fault, why do you call me cruel? Act as serene as I do, you have abandoned me, and it is no insult to say that you are unfaithful.""

No. 12 Aria : ""Sol puo dir come si trova"" (Agenore)***

[Agenore is enduring the worst pains of losing his love because of Alessandro's decision]

""The only one who can tell what a lover feels in my situation is another unlucky lover who's experienced it exactly as I did. My torment is worse than all others, a despair impossible to bear.""

[This is Agenore's heroic aria, a great tenor aria, punctuated by an agitated orchestra. It is in C minor, tending ""to exclude from the repeat all the more cheerful images that had been admitted the first time around in order to intensify the pieces's somber character."" As usual, Mozart is at his best in any aria of anger, fury, revenge.]

No. 13 Aria : ""Voi che fausti ognor donate"" (Alessandro)

""You, who dispense honor, and add more leaves to my laurels, protecting gods, assist me with the motions of my heart.""

[Alessandro begs the gods to support him in his feelings and decisions ""secondate amici di anche i moti del mio cor.""]

No. 14 Quintetto : ""Viva l'invitto duce"" (Elisa, Tamiri, Aminta, Agenore, Alessandro)

[How come everybody's late for the wedding? Tamiri appears, with Agenore. Tamiri reveals that Agenore is sacrificing his love for her. Should she value her new rank above his true soul? Then Elisa appears, crying for mercy. Alessandro is robbing her of her peace, her happiness, her lover, who gave her his heart since childhood. Alessandro points out that it is Aminta the shepherd who gave her his heart, but not so the new king.

Then the climax. Aminta appears, dressed as a shepherd. He places his royal garments at Alessandro's feet, and announces his return to his flock, his pastoral life, and his freedom.
Like the great general he is, Alessandro suddenly grasps the whole situation and, to his credit, immediately acts on his new appraisal.
He decides on the spot not to break up such genuine love (""S generosi amanti non divida Alessandro""). Aminta can get his Elisa (""Eccoti, Aminta, la bella Elisa""), and Tamiri her Agenore (""Ecco, Tamiri, il tuo Agenore fedel""). Aminta and Elisa will be rulers of the kingdom, and as for Agenore and Tamiri, their exalted feelings also deserve a kingdom (""a tanta virt non manca un regno."") Alessandro will carve out a new kindgom for them somewhere.]

""Long live the duke, our guest.""

[They all sing to their lucky stars in heaven, to love, and their happiness. ""This finale consists of three choral strophes divided by two brief homophonic duets.""
The glorification goes, beyond the invited guest, beyond the figure of Alessandro, to the final victor -- true love.]

MARIA-THERESA, ARCHDUCHESS OF AUSTRIA, HOLY ROMAN EMPRESS, LAST RULER OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG, STOPPED MOZART IN HIS TRACKS AS A FULL-TIME OPERA COMPOSER

The young archduke Maximilian, in whose honor ""Il Re Pastore"" was composed, was the youngest son of the Empress Maria Theresa (1717-1780), the formidable heir to the Habsburg territories (Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Milan, Mantua, Parma, and the Austrian Netherlands that became Belgium, etc.) -- the only such female to reign over the Habsburg empire. She also became Holy Roman Empress after the death of her husband Francis I. She had 16 children, 11 sons and 5 daughters. They included Joseph II and Leopold II -- both Holy Roman Emperors who played a role in Mozart's life -- and Marie-Antoinette, the famous French queen.

The Austrian Empress Maria-Theresa had a fateful effect on Mozart's career and life. The case of Mozart's failure to be offered a position in Milan after his extraordinary successes of ""Mitridate"" in Dec. 1770, ""Ascanio in Alba"" in Oct. 1771, and ""Lucio Silla"" in Dec. 1772 -- a display of supreme opera composition skills -- and in spite of all the vigorous PR work by his father/manager Leopold, remained mysterious until the discovery of the letter from Empress Maria Theresa of Dec. 12, 1771 expressing her objection to the Mozarts because of their habits of roving throughout Europe.
This was a reply to her son Ferdinand, interested in hiring the Mozarts, following the elegant ""Ascanio in Alba"" produced in celebration of his wedding in Oct. 1771. The Empress objected as she disliked them for their behaving like ""useless people...who degrade your service when they go about the world like beggars"". Ferdinand obeyed his mother, and never offered employment to Mozart.

This proved to be a fateful decision. Maria Theresa bore the responsibility for dissuading her son, archduke Ferdinand, from hiring young Mozart in Milan who had proved to every opera connoisseur's satisfaction that he was a consummate opera composer at such a young age. Any experienced opera house manager would have thanked his luck for finding such a young superb professional composer, who held the promise of many future compositions. Maria Theresa played the black part of bad luck in Mozart's life scenario, as she, in fact, crushed the best chances he ever had to secure a stable position as a court opera composer.

THE FAILURE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT IN MILAN WAS THE MAJOR TRAGEDY OF MOZART'S LIFE, LEADING HIM INTO A CHAOTIC CAREER AS A FREE-LANCE OPERA COMPOSER WITH A REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY OF ONLY 19 COMPLETE OPERAS

One can empathize with the bitter disappointment of Leopold, who, after guiding his phenomenal son through a fairy-tale start in life, was obliged to see him flounder hopelessly in trying to establish himself as the other great opera composers had done before, like Haendel, Johann Christian Bach, Haydn, and many more obscure opera composers.
This failure of Mozart to get an appointment in Milan as a court opera composer, in spite of his incontestable superior competency, is the real tragedy of Mozart's fate.

Getting a job early in Milan in 1773 would have radically improved Mozart's career, giving him a stable and productive court position (similar to what Haendel and Johann Christian Bach enjoyed in Milan, before they moved to London), allowing him a healthier lifestyle -- with fewer stressful career and economic worries, and no need for endless travelings to promote his music -- and possibly a longer lifespan. He might also have moved directly to London after Milan, avoiding the heartaches and worries that plagued him until his death.
With a stable job at age 17, Mozart would have been good for 2 or 3 operas a year, and could have easily left us 50 to 60 operas. Instead, he was obliged to waste his prodigious talent on a mass of boring boilerplate religious texts that few people bother to listen to these days, and spend a lot of time and effort on the challenge of surviving as a free-lance composer, frantically traveling all over Europe, often with slim results.

Il Re Pastore K 208 (1775) is the last opera of Mozart's teenage years. In 8 years, from 1767 to 1775, from age 11 to 19, Mozart composed 11 operas (including ""La Betulia Liberata"" K 118, his only oratorio, but practically in full operatic form, written in the spring of 1771, after ""Mitridate"" and before ""Ascanio""). The decade of his teen years were to count as his most productive phase in life for opera. Leopold's effort to establish him as an opera composer in a great court didn't succeed.
From 1775 to 1781, for 6 long years -- when Mozart was burning with the desire to write operas, as he felt his record showed he was above all destined to write operas -- he had no commission, until the Munich court asked him to set ""Idomeneo"" K 366 to music for its Jan. 1781 carnival.
From 1781 to 1791, his ten years in Vienna, Mozart completed only 8 operas.
In all, he composed 19 operas, his total lifetime output. In addition there were fragments for 3 unfinished operas (""Zaide"" K 344 of 1779, ""L'Oca del Cairo"" K 422, and ""Lo Sposo Deluso"" K 430, both of 1784). [The 3 choruses, and interludes written for ""Thamos, King of Egypt"" are not counted as an opera ""composition"".]

This production is not impressive when compared, for instance, with the output of Alessandro Scarlatti (63 operas), Antonio Vivaldi (50 operas), Haendel (42 operas, 27 oratorios), Leonardo Vinci (37 operas in 11 years!), Johann A. Hasse (69 operas), Baldassare Galuppi (109 operas!), Christoph Gluck (49 operas), Niccolo Jommelli (81 operas), Pasquale Anfossi (68 operas, 22 oratorios), Niccolo Piccinni (113 operas!), Johann Christian Bach (40 operas), Giovanni Paisiello (94 operas), Gaetano Donizetti (75 operas), etc.

In a period of intense productivity of Italian operas in the 18th c., Mozart's output looked decidedly meager. The music world was robbed of all the operas Mozart could have given us with a little bit of better luck, and more understanding support from the Austrian Habsburgs.",1406592000,2,31661,4.829025110782865
8144523,5,B000I8OFLE,"This very early composition by Mozart was written when he was 19 and it received just one performance. This Salzburg production is the first since then. This Serenata could be described as a sort of mini-opera of the type referred to as opera seria. That means that the story is very stylised and concerns itself with the activities of Gods or of the high born such as kings, queens and ranks of nobility. This story fits that description well. The vocal line in such an opera would be seen as an opportunity for vocal display and would often be written with particular singers in mind.

Essentially the story concerns two couples who are of noble birth but are not aware of that entirely. Alexander, in his desire to leave the newly defeated countries in peace is keen to appoint a king and provide him with a wife. In so doing he correctly finds the correct king, currently believing himself to be a shepherd, but mixes up the couples so that each couple is given the wrong partner. Eventually all is sorted out, each couple gets the correct partner, Alexander leaves a peaceful situation and everyone is happy.

This production turns out to be completely enjoyable in the stylishly modern and minimalist way that so often occurs at Salzburg. The modern and very stylised production certainly does not detract from either the enjoyment or the understanding of the opera and being so stylised fits the concept well. The action takes place at two levels with a small puppet-show type of theatre setting on the stage with a curtain that can be drawn across by the singers who are also positioned front of this theatre setting on the stage. When in the 'theatre' setting that are dressed in stylised and minimalist costumes with an emphasis on black and white. Otherwise they are dressed in modern clothes thus bridging the gap between ancient and modern.

The performance is given in the university Great Hall but it could easily be mistaken for a typical school hall equipped with a small stage. This does not matter in a production of this sort.

All the singers are accurate and sing in the appropriate Mozartian style and with complete enjoyment and security. They relate well to each other and are able to act convincingly even in this stylish manner and this adds considerably to the enjoyment of the production.

The three female roles, Arminta sung by Annette Dasch, Elisa sung by Marlis Petersen and Tamiri sung by Arpine Rahdjian are typical of the quality of the new generation of young singers/actors that grace many modern productions. Andreas Karasiak as Agenore is described as having a creamy character to his voice and this is a fair description. On that basis I would describe the vocal characteristics of Kresmir Spicer as Alexander as having a gritty type of texture. Both of these men are able to sing and act fluently and make a good team with the young women.

The orchestral playing of the Balthasar-Neumann ensemble is both energetic and correctly scaled under the direction of Thomas Hengelbrock. The sound is excellent and presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo and the camera work is sympathetic, fully involving and very crisp.

This should give plenty of undemanding enjoyment - but don't expect the complexities or maturity of a Marriage of Figaro! Astonishing for a 19 year old composer though - or even one twice as old! There are nevertheless plenty of early signs that Mozart's musical language was already instinctive to him even at such an early stage in his career. Overall it seems to me that this lively and imaginative production of a very rarely performed composition is fully deserving of a 5 star rating.",1342915200,2,3645,4.803827751196172
8144524,5,B000I8OFLE,"Mozart's Il re pastore (KV 208) is hardly well known. This DVD shows that this serenata has more to it than youthfull charm and pastoral navite.

Mozart was 19 when he composed this two-act mini-opera on a libretto by the old warhorse Pietro Metastasio. The plot is from the time of Alexander the Great where we meet blue-blooded herds and an Alexander keen to give back his conquests to theire rightfull heirs. The plot is arguably less silly than many other pastorals of the time, but still a staging like that we have here gives this drama a more explicit sense of purpose.

Thomas Hengelbrock is not only conductor, he is also responsible for the staging. This proves to be a most welcome combination as it gives a sense of coherence and deep understanding of the relation between text and music that is rare.

The scenery is set against a marionette-theater whith costumes and backgrounds in black and white. It plays with the images of playing cards and underlines the message of a conflict of choice and fate, before it breaks out into a more realistic setting whith costumes in cassual clothes.

Running less than two hours and sung whith a clear vision of the characters this is a treat of a performance. Thomas Hengelbrock conducts the Balthasar-Neumann-Ensemble whith fire and gives both the instrumentalist and the singers the space they need to give the music free rein.

The singers Marlis Petersen (soprano, Elisa, a noble girl (/nymph)in love with Aminta) and Annette Dasch (mezzo-soprano, Aminta, a shepherd in love with Elisa) are particullary impressive.

The arias are clearly intended to show a rich variety of types. From Alessandro's (baryton, Kresimir Spicer) opera seria-like ""Si spande al sole in faccia"" (no. 4) to Aminta's rondeaux ""L'amer, sar costante"" (no. 10) with a ravishing violin obligato of Sebastian Hamann in a Johann-Christian-Bach-like song that also bears resemblances to later arias of Mozart's singspiels (Seraglio and Magic Flute).

Alessandro is played as a little too keen, and quite childish ruler. Agenore (tenor, Andreas Karasiak) is played as a spoilt dandy that evolves into a scincere and understanding lover. Tamiri (mezzo-soprano, Arpin Rahdjian) is a hot-blooded girl in love with Agenore.

The singers are all very convincing both musically and as actors. However Petersen and Dasch showes real stagepresence throughout and proves to be superior in every way. In adition to their good looks their voices seems to be particularly well suited to their roles.

The orchestra plays with a crisp articulation and the brass is well into the fore, with a very impressive hornplaying in some of the arias.

This is a performance wich is not easily forgotten and which I guess also makes sense for a lot of people also on an existential level.",1228176000,9,2791,5.008639308855291
8144525,5,B000I8OFLE,"This along with La Finta Semplice and La Finta Giardiniera are my favoites of the Mozart 22 series. Annette's voice is nice, but Marlis Peterson's is amazing! But together they are out of this world. Their duet is the best sounding amazing duet out of the whole series that I've heard so far.  I love that duet so much, I have listened to it over and over again.  I hope I don't burn a hole in the dvd.  Marlis's other two arias are absolutely wonderful. I just love her voice.  The simpliciy of the production is nice so you can focus on the great singing.",1203206400,8,557,4.276190476190476

8144527,4,B000I8OFLE,"Overall, a good production, spare staging but well sung, especially by the soprano Miss Marlis Petersen who appeared to have complete control over her voice which had the range and flexibility needed for a Mozart opera. A most enjoyable work.",1173484800,3,242,5.075
8144528,5,B000I8OFLE,"Halfway through this remarkable collection of all Mozart operas on DVD taped in Salzburg in 2006 comes a ravishing, miraculous ""Il Re Pastore"". This ""Pastoral Serenade"" for benevolent kings, shepherds and green landscapes has an appalling libretto. The music Mozart manages to write out of this nonsense is again nothing short of miraculous.

And the way the conductor/director Thomas Hengelbrock manages to bring these five cardboard characters to life is again nothing short of a miracle.

Hengelbrock being a musician, his production is essentially very musical, sober, sometimes on the verge of austerity. 5 singer/actors decide to ""role play"" Il Re Pastore. Every one of them is allocated a character and off they go. The stage is divided in two parts. The ""real life"", colourful bit at the forefront, and the black-and-white stage in the background, which is where most of the ensembles and arias take place. Every aspect of this production is very elegant, from the gracious silhouettes of landscape, sheep and soldiers, all screened in the background, to the superb costumes of Mirella Weingarten.

Musically, this is one of the best casts of the collection so far. Annette Dasch and Marlis Petersen have beautiful, very identifiable voices: their duet at the end of Act I is a masterpiece of balance, lyricism and team spirit: both singers listen to each other and this makes for a great feeling of ensemble. Each individual aria by these two ladies is phenomenal. Andreas Karasiak has a very agreeable tone, while Arpine Rahdjian has an ENORMOUS voice! Her first aria blows the roof away! Watch for her Wagner and her Strauss quite soon. As for Alessandro, Kresimir Spicer, he is the somewhat weak link of this great cast, I think he sings too much from the throat - he may want to alter his technique going forward.

In the pit, Thomas Hengelbrock is enthusiastic, precise, and supportive. His orchestra, the Balthasar-Neumann-Ensemble, plays with a contagious sense of energy and can be very loud when necessary!

The production is also remarkable by the energy and the attention given to the sacrificial lamb of any ""young Mozart"" opera: the recitativo secco. Great care has been put in acting them properly and playing them properly. The harpsichord of Nicolau de Figureido adds considerably to the musical beauty of the piece.

I cannot finish this review without mentioning one of the most beautiful scenes in this whole M22 collection: Aminta (Annette Dasch) sings her beautiful rondo ""L'amero, saro costante"" in front of a blue curtain. Behind it, the silhouette of the concertmeister, Sebastian Hamann, who left the pit, playing the solo violin. If this combination of beautiful singing, superb staging and fantastic music making does not move you to tears, then there is something wrong with you. Unforgettable.",1168905600,26,2831,5.130151843817788
