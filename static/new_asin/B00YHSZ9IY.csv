7214381,4,B00YHSZ9IY,"""Lambert & Stamp"" (2014 release; 117 min.) is a documentary about Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, 2 Brits best known for managing the Who for about a decade (mid-60s to mid-70s). As the documentary opens and after a few words from Pete Townsend, we are introduced to Chris Stamp, who starts telling stories of how it all began, him and Lambert in the early 60s trying to make the jump from assistant director to director. One day, they decide to shoot a movie, cinema verite-style, about an unknown band that they would manage. After looking for months for the right band, Lambert comes across a packed club full of Mods, dancing to an unknown band call the High Numbers. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

There are several factors why this is such an entertaining documentary: for one, it's a great story, I mean you can't make this stuff up! Then we are blessed to have the interviews with Chris Stamp, who turns out to be a master story teller (other interviewees include Pete Townsend, Roger and Heather Daltrey, and many others). Then we have the incredible luck that these guys were trying to shoot a movie, and hence we have all this incredible footage from the earliest days of the High Numbers/the Who (1964-65), and that alone is worth the price of admission for this documentary. There is tons of other worthwhile archive footage, such as the 1967 French TV footage, where we see Lambert give an interview in perfect French. We reach the ""Tommy""-era about 75 min. into the movie, and I was afraid that things were going to become less interesting after that, but as it turns out, that's where the fireworks are about to start... As a casual fan of the Who but an ardent fan of rock music and its history, I found this documentary absolutely worth seeing. The only negative comment that I have is that for some strange reason, the sound mix in the theater was such that at times the background music (usually of the Who) played too loudly and as a result I had trouble understanding the interviewee at times. Very strange.

""Lambert & Stamp"" opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati for what turned out to be a one week run, so I was quite lucky to see it on the last day of its run here. The early evening screening where I saw this at was surprisingly well attended. If you are a fan of the Who or of rock music history, you will not want to miss this. ""Lambert & Stamp"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1432857600,29,2506,4.5176211453744495

7214403,5,B00YHSZ9IY,"This doc covers all the stuff NOT covered in either ""The Kids Are Alright"" or ""The Amazing Journey"" about The Who's original manager's Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. It covers their history and background in archival footage and interviews with surviving members of The Who (Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey) and also Chris Stamp and Irish Jack. It is both an eye opener for the time and how (NOT) to manage a successful Rock Band! No extras on the DVD, but hopefully on the Blue Ray. A MUST for any Who fan (or potential band managers) out there. My only criticism is that not enough was mentioned about Pete Meaden (maybe that should be for another documentary altogether).

7214407,3,B00YHSZ9IY,"An abundance of interesting and pivotal Who footage saves this from being a complete bust. The film seems to have been mostly made for Chris Stamp, Pete Townshend, and Roger Daltrey. Ultimately it was frustrating much how the film slowed down as Kit & Chris meandered out of the Who's lives. As a die-hard Who fan, I thought this would have even more about how they worked together. While there are a few clips of Kit Lambert in interviews, his absence from the overall film means a lot of other people telling his story on his behalf. He's long gone, so it was the only way to make this film really.

To its credit, it does not shy away from the difficulties in their relationships, revealing insights that have not always been clear to those outside the band's inner circle - such as the story of Kit's disappointment over the TOMMY film. Overall, a somewhat mixed result bolstered by fantastic early footage of the band.",1464652800,,923,4.593939393939394

Fans of rock and roll will have no problem at all recognizing the band named The Who. Theyve been around since the sixties and were perhaps the biggest rock band behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Known for the offstage antics as well as the dynamic performances that went from small clubs to Woodstock to continued world tours, they have been one of the preeminent bands to exist. But the names Lambert and Stamp probably aren't as familiar. Thats about to change.

LAMBERT AND STAMP is a new documentary concerning the two promoters/managers who took a small town group playing local clubs and teen dances and turned them into one of the biggest bands of all times. Two young men with aspirations of becoming the newest thing on the film scene they decided in the early sixties to make a movie about the rise and fall of a modern day rock band. The band they chose was called the High Numbers, a name they ditched for them changing them to The Who.

The two men came from very different backgrounds. Chris Stamp came from a working class background and was the brother of Terence Stamp, an actor on the rise at that time. Kit Lambert came from a background of wealth and influence. While being completely different they meshed well together and their love of film is what brought them together.

As their dream of a film about a rock band took more and more of their time, as well as the band becoming more successful than expected, they abandoned the film and decided to become full time managers instead. Taking the group and changing various things about them they made them the super band that they became. At the same time it wasn't just the image that took them to a higher stratosphere but the true musical abilities of all involved as well.

The movie begins with the meeting of Lambert and Stamp and carries on past their eventual breakup with the band and then culminates with a reunion with Chris Stamp not long ago. During that time we see behind the scenes workings of the band, the problems they faced with drummer Keith Moon who was headed for self-destruction, the creative energy found in their rock opera TOMMY and more. A combination of footage taken at the time mixed with more current interviews move us back and forth in time to get a more complete look at the band and how they not only changed with the times but were affected by them as well.

More than that we are presented with a deeper knowledge of the two men that helped to make them who they are. While the focus of the film is about Lambert and Stamp the fact is that while they were influential to what became of the band it was through the band that they found their fame and fortunes as well. There is no way to tell their story without tying it together with that of The Who.

This film is one of the better documentaries Ive seen in some time. It takes the subject matter and hand and presents them, warts and all, in a way thats both interesting and informative. Before the film ends you wonder what would have happened had they taken on a different band as well as what would have happened had they done things better in the later years they had with the band.

If you're a fan of rock and roll and especially if you love The Who then youll want to make a point of seeing this film. For the truly die-hard fans it will soon be taking up a place on your shelf. A well-made movie that looks behind the curtain at the life of one of the biggest bands of all time.",1443484800,,3516,4.398461538461539

What begins as a fascinating look at the origins of one the most important musical groups of the past 40 years, devolves into a confusing story of one man's descent into his own personal hell. The storytelling is inconsistent, and, because we hear only one side of that story - Chris Stamp's version - a bit suspect. I was left feeling disappointed and with more questions than answers. Even early footage of The Who feels unsurprising and forced. Not what I expected, unfortunately. This from a life-long Who fan...",1440374400,4,611,4.719626168224299

If you have read books on The Who, and want to better understand the relationship(s) between Lambert, Stamp, and The Who, then you will definitely want to watch. The movie goes into good detail via interviews with Stamp, Townshend, and Daltrey. 40 years later, you can still see the sense of betrayal and sadness in Pete's face when he describes the beginning of the breakup between Lambert/Stamp and The Who. I have been a Whophile since 1989, and this movie lent insight into the most inspirational management The Who ever had. I am glad I bought it.

That was the home of Radio Caroline. There are a lot of references to Eton Place, but nothing like the video repeats of Caroline House. What was the relationship of Lambert and Stamp to the entity known as Radio Caroline? So much sheer rubbish has been written about Radio Caroline - including the daft and totally untrue idea that it was founded by Ronan O'Rahilly and named after Caroline Kennedy. So having Lambert and Stamp shown in the doorway of Caroline House - with The Who loading their instruments into a car outside, really, really, really raises questions about this 'fake history' of both Caroline and The Who.

8718297,5,B00YHSZ9IY,"When you see the role of the rock manager in this film you get an appreciation for this complex relationship.  In the early days of the WHO, Chris Stamp worked in the film business to pay the bills of a struggling band.  The rest is history as seen in Lambert & Stamp",1512864000,,267,4.115384615384615
8718298,5,B00YHSZ9IY,"This is a must for any Who fan! This is a great behind the scenes look at the making of one of rocks most influential bands from the 1970's. The film interviews the two surviving band members, Pete and Roger along with Chris Stamp brother of actor Terrence Stamp. You have to laugh but also applaud the determination of both Lambert&Stamp upon creating the band's image. For those who are not familiar with The Who like their rabid fans such as myself; the journey is quite interesting and gives an honest portrayal of what being in a band was like for young people looking to make it big in the music industry during the glory days of the British Invasion. Although bands such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones come to mind when speaking of that era, but The Who, The Dave Clark Five, Donovan and others are kind of left behind so to speak. This film gives an honest and humorous portrayal of what being in a band and trying to making a living at it was like.",1496275200,,964,4.361111111111111

8718300,5,B00YHSZ9IY,"Very interesting as are most things with the Who.  Might call it the blind leading the blind.  Although the managers and the band itself  may have been seat of pants flying, Pete's mind-boggling talent took them to the top.  At least the managers had the good sense to encourage him.",1489190400,,283,4.6
8718301,5,B00YHSZ9IY,"Essential for a Who fan, especially one who knows the ""official"" story backwards and forwards already. It's less about documenting things like shows (buy The Kids Are Alright for that), although there are some stunning clips I'd never seen before -- for instance, a very young Pete demoing Glittering Girl live for Kit and Chris, swoon. It delves much more deeply into the relationships, the huge role that Kit Lambert played in Pete's artistic development and how fragile the relationships that keep us going can be. Highly recommended.",1487116800,,537,5.113636363636363
