8048041,1,B0007L6W0E,"I thought I was getting a different movie from MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING, but this DVD contains ""Double Feature"" with a ""The Shadow"" movie and ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning"". It has a unauthentic looking 2-color wrapper with made in Singapore written on it. I have not opened it yet, I am not sure if DVD has anything on it. I want to return it but I would lose $$$ due to postage cost. I have been duped. DO NOT BUY. I am surprised that Amazon has this for sale.",1128038400,4,456,4.134831460674158
