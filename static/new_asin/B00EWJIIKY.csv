8610067,3,B00EWJIIKY,"The Mummy's Ghost & The Mummy's Curse, 1940 films

This set contains two horror movies from the 1940s that feature ""The Mummy"", a creature that rises from the dead past to threaten the current living. They are a sequel to the 1932 movie, the origin for these stories. A 3,000 year old preserved mummy can be brought back to life by the use of a magic potion brewed from ""tanna leaves"". Their background tells about life and its assumptions in 1940s America, as viewed by Hollywood. The 1942 Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a super-agency that controlled wages and prices for the war effort. It restricted Hollywood spending and consumption. Movies were made with lower lighting (""film noir"") to save coal and oil. Background sets were reused whenever possible. Film footage from earlier movies was recycled for lower costs. Note that recurring TV shows avoid the problem of new sets. [Do tanna leaves have a symbolic meaning?] You'll note some parallels to vampire films. An undead creature desires the life of a young maiden until he is stopped and destroyed.

""The Mummy's Ghost"" [1943] begins with a new high priest; he will travel to Mapleton to reanimate Kharis with tanna leaves so Princess Ananka can be returned for proper burial in Egypt. What will happen when the Princess arrives in the swamp? Will the plans go awry?

""The Mummy's Curse"" [1944] takes place in the swamps of Louisiana. [What happened to Mapleton, that pleasant New England town?] Kharis is once again sent to rescue Princess Ananka. Will she resist this rescue? [How were they buried in the swamp?] Will swamp water create a miraculous do-over on a muddy mummy? This was the last of these 1940s mummy movies.
