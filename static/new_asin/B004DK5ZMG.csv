4332637,5,B004DK5ZMG,"...But that's what one would suspect with Errol Flynn in the lead. His presence at the head of any cast was sufficient to lift any ""B"" project to the commendable status of an ""A"" movie.

Lloyd C. Douglas's 1936 novel, on which this film is based, was both sentimental and inspirational. It was also a very long read. In transcribing the book to screenplay, a few significant characters and sub-plots have thus been deleted; nevertheless, the filmmakers have retained the emotional impact. Any fan of Douglas's novels (including ""The Robe"") will not be disappointed.

This DVD version of ""Green Light"" is distributed by Warner Archives, which specializes in the studios' less-known and lesser-remembered titles. As is the case with most of those in the collection, Warners has released the best-available existing copy, rather than offering digitally ""cleaned-up"" versions. Since this film was produced in 1937, a viewer may discover more than the usual number of scratches and flaws in both picture and sound; however, overall, the product is, if not pristine, certainly better than just merely acceptable. And despite the occasional ""blips,"" the sound quality is amazingly clear, especially for a film produced nearly 3/4 of a century ago.

Conclusion: A ""must"" for any fan of either the star, Flynn, or the author, Douglas.",1304294400,11,1325,5.182242990654205
4332638,4,B004DK5ZMG,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""Green Light"" (20 February 1937) (85 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- When Errol Flynn insisted that Warner Bros. come up with a non-swashbuckler for his next vehicle, the result was Green Light. Based on a novel by Lloyd C. Douglas (Magnificent Obsession, The Robe etc.) --- The film tells the story of a young surgeon (Flynn) who willingly takes blame for a fatal mistake committed by an older doctor (Henry O'Neill) --- Disgraced, Flynn takes the near-suicidal assignment of testing a new vaccine for spotted fever; to ascertain the serum's effectiveness, he must expose himself to the disease --- Flynn's fiance (Anita Louise), having learned that her lover was not responsible for the older doctor's error, is reunited with Flynn as he lies recuperating from the fever --- Weaving in and out of Green Light is the kindly old spiritual leader (Cedric Hardwicke) who espouses the values of sacrifice and faith.

Green Light did acceptable box office business, but Errol Flynn was back at his sword-wielding best in his next film, The Prince and the Pauper.

8425439,4,B004DK5ZMG,"This b/w film has a very interesting and exiting story. It's about two doctors who try to find a vaccine against a disease that every spring is caused by very small insects. People who have to work on the fields died. Errol Flynn plays the role of a doctor very well. Frankly, I find him personally always in what film also he is playing in, very good.",1506038400,,352,4.268656716417911

8425445,3,B004DK5ZMG,"I enjoyed Green Light as I thoroughly enjoyed the message conveyed, ""God has a special purpose for each of us regardless of our intellectual or physical gifts, and even in view of our intellectual or physical handicaps.""  Some may think the movie outdated, even saturated in corniness, but I really thought it profound and was captivated by the performance of Sir Cedric Hardwicke.  The remainder of the cast performed extremely well, and it's difficult not to be stirred by the gallant Errol Flynn.

Personally, I should have given the film four stars, but in an attempt at objectivity, reduced it to three.  Not for everyone, but a film I'm glad I purchased.",1418601600,2,660,4.866071428571429
8425446,4,B004DK5ZMG,"In The Green Light Errol Flynn swashes no buckles, and yet he still plays a noble hero, only in a less martial profession. Writer Lloyd C. Douglas had made an impact on cinema, what with Hollywood's adaptation of his novels: Magnificent Obsession (1935), The Robe (1953), and this one, The Green Light (1937). Magnificent Obsession and Green Light share the theme of noble self-sacrifice in the medical field. FLynn fleshes out his role of brilliant young surgeon Newell Paige who assumes the blame for his senior colleague's (Henry O'Neil) bungled operation that resulted in the patient's death. After the hearing, London's Baytree Hospital has no recourse but to fire Dr. Paige.

Who knew one mustn't cut the artery so short that it couldn't be tied off proper? Dr. Paige's peers mutter about the injustice of his taking the fall, but, really, only the smitten surgery nurse Frances Ogilvie (Margaret Lindsay) was raring to expose the cover-up. And, honestly, it's Nurse Ogilvie toward whom I most readily gravitated. Margaret Lindsay does such a good job of portraying her, with her spirit and her steadfastness and her unrequited feelings. Lindsay's performance overshadows that of Anita Louise's, which may not be what the studio heads intended. Louise plays Phyllis Dexter, the sort of immature daughter of the patient who expired under the care of Dr. Paige and his senior colleague.

""You're all involved in whiskey and heroics, and you don't know what you're talking about,"" grouses Dr. Paige's bacteriologist friend as he tries to lift the despondent Paige out of the deep mopes. He also condemns him thusly: ""You're 50,000 kinds of an idiot. You're also a sentimentalist. Worse than that, you're being noble."" And maybe the bacteriologist's tough love approach works - or maybe it's the romantic complications that surface - because Dr. Newell Paige eventually seeks out a fresh start and a stab at redemption.

He relocates to Montana, to a festering valley wherein his bacteriologist friend is feverishly trying to find the cure for spotted fever. Dr. Paige makes it his mission to help his friend find the vaccine, no matter the cost, even going as far as to... well, I shouldn't say.

The references to the film's title - the ""green light"" - go so speedily by that they may escape the viewer's attention. In the book, a kindly Episcopal dean engages his visitors in lengthy conversations in which the symbology of the green traffic light is frequently raised. The green light is a metaphor for the signs given by the universe to spur on humanity's progress and potential. Whether be it time constraints or studio head preferences, screenwriter Milton Krims snipped off most of the dean's conversations and concentrated instead on the book's romantic angle which may have been the book's weakest element. The ad campaign reflected this, touting the film as ""an x-ray of unquestioning love."" Still, Sir Cedric Hardwicke has his solid moments as the dean with the crippled limbs and the serene perspective.

The Green Light was a box office hit, maybe because medical melodramas were the rage at the time, maybe because heartfelt messages about eternity and faith were popular, or maybe because Errol Flynn was well on his way to being a matinee idol. There is a strong philosophical thread concerning religion. It's up to you to decide whether it gets too preachy. I didn't think it was, because I think Sir Hardwicke plays his part well and with sincerity and with warmth. I don't know that I'll watch it again, but medical dramas aren't my bag. And I'm just not used to an Errol Flynn who does battle with a stethoscope and who doesn't sneer in the face of authority. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1391385600,4,3702,4.935794542536115
8425447,3,B004DK5ZMG,"They say it is a mistake to read a book before seeing the movie version.  No better case than here, the book which was the best seller of 1935 is butchered here like no other book to film comparison I can think of.  That being said the movie can stand on it's own merits as an acceptable little melodrama.  The book has much broader insights that I am sure were very attractive to depression era readers.  The film probably focused more on what depression era moviegoers were looking for...an attractive leading man, a romance, a little tension, and a quick pace.  If you have read the book as I did just prior to viewing the movie, you will be grossly disappointed at the complete restructuring of characters, settings, and timelines while trying to somehow hold the plot.  My advise is see the movie first and you will probably find it entertaining.  The book is a very good read though so I recommend that more highly (just not before the film).",1381104000,,948,4.541176470588235
