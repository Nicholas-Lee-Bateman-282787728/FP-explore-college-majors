8564106,4,B00B8G7H2Y,"Set in 1590, the sengoku (warring states) period of Japan, ""The Floating Castle"" (""Nobou no Shiro"") chronicles the battle of 3,000-strong ragtag warriors led by Narita NAGACHIKA, or ""Nobou""-sama, against the Toyotomi army of 20,000 warriors. The 2012 smash hit in Japan is based on a historical novel by Ryu Wada, which is inspired by the real-life battle at Oshi Jo (Oshi Castle) that still exists in Gyoda city, Saitama.

The historical drama centers on an unlikely hero Nagachika, a samurai affectionately called by local farmers ""nobou""-sama - ""nobou"" short for ""dekunobou"" meaning ""good for nothing"" or ""fool."" Being in charge of the castle under siege, Nagachika or ""Lord Bone"" thinks of not fighting at first, but changes his mind when he meets the enemy army's arrogant messenger.

Co-directed by Isshin Inudo and Shinji Higuchi, the film may contain some well-executed (and pretty bloody) combat scenes, but ""The Floating Castle"" is basically a comedy with a touch of pathos. Those who are familiar with historical figures during the sengoku era will notice the irony when Mitsunari ISHIDA in charge of the sieging army is described as a clever man, but not exactly a wise commander, a character trait that foreshadows his fate at the decisive battle at Sekigahara ten years after.

Mansai Nomura (""Onmyoji"") plays Lord ""Nobou,"" the central character that you may find either arresting or annoying. While some praise his performance as the complicated hero embodying idealism and realism, others (including some Japanese audiences) accuse him of his ""buffoonish"" acting. I for one enjoyed his acting style with his very theatrical mannerism (Mansai Nomura is a well-known Kyogen stage actor), though some might find his antics out of place.

The titular ""Floating Castle"" refers to Oshi Jo (Oshi Castle), a castle that in the film looks more like a small fortress surrounded by lakes. For this film the set was constructed in Hokkaido, and this is one of the assets of the historical drama.

Don't expect something like Takashi Miike's ""13 Assassins"" here. ""The Floating Castle"" is more a comedy than an action, and like most comedies, the content is often culture-based.",1374278400,7,2180,5.146892655367232
