He gets accepted to colledge at age 13. When there, he meets a girl and developes a crush on her. He enrolls himself in her school and creates a bad boy image to impress her. When she finds out who he really is, she gets upset. Now he has to set things right with her, and help his school win a hockey championship! This movie teaches kids to be themselves!

8288144,1,6305801797,"Genius was not what I expected. The story about boy of junior high school age who is a nuclear physicist and goes to college was contrived and grew more unrealistic as the movie progressed. The two leading young actors were appealing, but the story did not move me. There are now three or four movies with the title ""Genius."" I was looking for the latest, which my wife and I saw in a local movie theater. Don't be fooled by the title.",1468540800,,435,4.317073170731708
