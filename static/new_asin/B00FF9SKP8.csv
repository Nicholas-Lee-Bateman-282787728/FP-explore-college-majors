5986624,5,B00FF9SKP8,I had never heard of this movie before.  I saw it listed on Amazon Instant Video and decided to check it out.  I rented it then but think I am going to go back and buy it for my collection.  Excellent story line.,1387152000,,212,3.883720930232558
5986625,5,B00FF9SKP8,Love it!! The message in the end was superb!! Hope it has a part two! A MUST SEE! Peace. :),1386979200,12,91,3.6
5986626,4,B00FF9SKP8,"Great story; good acting by entire cast. So many themes -- love, marriage, career, childlessness, family, the arts, frustration, despair and triumph.",1386720000,13,149,5.818181818181818
5986627,5,B00FF9SKP8,Can't recall the last time I watched a movie twice in the same night. Storyline is interesting and thought provoking.,1386633600,6,117,4.9
5986628,2,B00FF9SKP8,The poetry promise was good but the profanity in said poetry was an extreme turnoff.  However the acting itself wasn't bad.,1386115200,7,123,4.857142857142857
5986629,5,B00FF9SKP8,"This movie was a modern day take on an old favorite, Love Jones. Although it initially came across as kinda low-budget (not a complaint, just an observation), as the movie went on, that thought quickly left my mind. I am normally overly critical of independent films, but this one was done beautifully. If you are a hopeless romantic, a neo-soul enthusiast, a fan of spoken word, and appreciate a good story about Black love, you will love this movie.",1385510400,76,451,4.7215189873417724
5986630,5,B00FF9SKP8,"Must see. Why? The story deserves our attention. It has:  Passion. Good love. Love gone bad. Words. Poems. Intelligence.
Something for mind and heart. Emotion. Plenty calisthenics (for those who enjoy action scenes). Beauty. High caliber acting. Real good music. A courageous story. Charles Murray writer, director, producer.  Actors who gave the film so much shine I saw it 3 times!",1384214400,48,383,5.262295081967213

5986674,3,B00FF9SKP8,"It was just okay. A typical black love story centered around sex and pain, with a low quality and unintelligent script for the characters. There were some pretty good parts toward the end, but it took a while to get there. The ending was a good plug to the pain of domestic violence, but the characters could have been developed so much better, and with better dialogue.",1487030400,,370,4.537313432835821
5986675,5,B00FF9SKP8,"Honestly. This is so good. Sooooo good! Omari Hardwick doesn't disappoint,so I gave it a try. Now, I watch it a lot. Its so far under the radar, that it makes me mad. REALLY good movie. Def worth it. Would buy it for friends too.",1484870400,3,229,4.111111111111111

5986691,5,B00FF9SKP8,"Ive watched this movie so many times. I was introduced to it by a friend who compared it to Love Jones. I understand the comparison and yet it is its own idea. Its a common untalked about story that doesnt disappoint in quality, acting nor feeling. Highly recommend.",1481241600,2,266,4.5625

5986697,4,B00FF9SKP8,We gave it 4 stars. We appreciated the artistry in the cinematography and the poetic flow. It displayed talent in its true form unscathed by the  over glamorized subjectification of hollywood. The story line loses a star because it fails to show realistic consequences for many poor decisions which in my humble opinion is reckless.,1468368000,,332,5.036363636363636
5986698,5,B00FF9SKP8,"I absolutely ADORE this movie!!!  I didn't wantt he movie to end!!

5986699,5,B00FF9SKP8,This is one of the best love stories I've ever seen. The language may be a bit much for some but the story-line and the chemistry between Kalindra and Curtis kept me glued to my screen. Sigh... such a good movie! :-),1466467200,2,216,4.166666666666667

5986704,3,B00FF9SKP8,"I thought this movie would be much better then it actually was. The husband was a real loser,I felt so sorry for her,trapped in a marriage that was no longer fulfilling,trying to pursue her dreams will no support from her deadbeat husband who I believe envied her passion and determination,something he no longer had. Then this fine,handsome kindred spirit comes into her life who sees her light and is only too willing to give her what she so desperately needs and she does the same for him. I gave it a 3 because it was kind of slow moving,and I thought the poetry was terrible!.",1458691200,,581,4.542857142857143
5986705,5,B00FF9SKP8,"Agree with other post, it somewhat like a modern day Love Jones. Its a interesting story line and the characters are believable.",1456704000,,128,4.863636363636363

5986732,4,B00FF9SKP8,"I honestly just love Omari Hardwick (however you spell it) in this film. He did such a great job. But I felt like they skipped parts. It went from her dissing him in one scene to already kissing him in another. It moved too fast. It didn't make sense. That transition was horrible. But if you can get past that, it is something to watch that will keep your interest",1452816000,,365,4.228571428571429

But baffled why soundtrack not available to buy, especially the song where Shanola and Omari were dancing close together under the blue moonlight.  Very very romantic song with nice beat, lyrics and vocals.  Would like to buy the song!

5986739,5,B00FF9SKP8,"I ordered this on prime movie channel. And man, it was so good.

5986782,5,B00FF9SKP8,"I thought this was a great movie.  It is refreshing to see movies similar to this one (which we do not see often) that isn't your 'typical' thug movie.  It's about the trials of life, period (regardless of race).  But the fact that this movie does a majestic job of expressing black love made it more favorable.",1436832000,,311,4.421052631578948

5986786,3,B00FF9SKP8,I thought that this movie was pretty good as far as the story line.  The actors were great.  The excessive use of profanity threw the movie off to me.  Throughout the movie I kept wondering why the writer scripted the movie with so much unnecessary profanity.  The movie could have been just as good without all the profanity.,1434412800,,326,4.568965517241379
5986787,5,B00FF9SKP8,It was the poetry that got the best of me.  I love artful movies and this one was great.  In my eyes Omari Hardwick can do no wrong and he is excellent in this movie.  Ms. Hampton did her share in carrying her role but I didn't expect anything less from her.  Its a moving story about abuse and self worth and finally finding your own path.,1434412800,,340,4.029850746268656
5986788,5,B00FF9SKP8,This is one of my favorite movies. The spoken word performances were amazing! Excellent movie and awesome love story. It did a great job on highlighting generational abuse with the different viewpoints of mother and daughter who were both in abusive marriages. The daughter chooses to leave in order to follow happiness and freedom. Omari Hardwick is the Knight in Shining Armour! I love happy endings.,1434326400,,402,5.106060606060606

5986862,5,B00FF9SKP8,"I loved this movie. This from someone who usually does not enjoy any movies. If you want to see beauty personified in the physical form of a woman....see Ms, Hampton in this movie. Her Hair was gorgeous.  If more actresses of African descent would be allowed to appear the way she did in this movie. We would resolve a lot of issues around issues of beauty and the African woman.  I thought the writing was decent and the acting was great. VERY WELLDONE !!!!",1419984000,,458,4.440476190476191

I love the theme of self-love, of growth, of letting go, of moving on, of finding your soul mate when you are focused on your own purpose.  I've watched this movie at least four times now. I had it saved on my DVR and it got accidentally deleted, so I decided to buy it. This movie perpetuates and personifies the realities of relationships in so many ways.  I appreciated th realness and candor of this  movie.  Can't wait to curl up in my bed and watch this again.",1414540800,,505,4.28421052631579
5986881,5,B00FF9SKP8,This movie is so engaging.  I really enjoyed the chemistry between the characters and the way the plot is executed.  Each actor performs their role effortlessly and convincingly enough to make you wonder if they were drawing on elements from their own lives. The combination of poetic expression and real life struggle made for a very emotional experience and will be relatable to anyone who has ever needed to use artistic activity to express feelings that could not be spoken in the midst of complicated relationships. I will watch this again.,1413849600,,545,4.978021978021978

It's not the typical ""guy meets girl, guy gets girl, guy loses girl and gets girl in the end"" mumbo jumbo. It's about growth, understanding who you are as a person, realizing your mistakes and learning from them and how you may think life is intended to go, may not always go that way.

5987106,4,B00FF9SKP8,"Beautiful poetry, beautiful leading lady and leading man, beautiful ending...just beautiful.

I also watched the movie twice because I loved the script and the chemistry between the actors. This movie dealt with some really serious domestic violence issues that were continuing from generation to generation. Also, this movie didn't wrap everything up like a romance novel where the main characters go off into happily ever after with a marriage and kids, but it was still a very nice ending that the viewer could appreciate because you knew what the leading lady was doing about her situation. In fact, you celebrate with her decisions. The leading man has some trials that he has to overcome and the closing scene hints that it seems to be moving in a positive direction as well.

Now I did watch it twice so I dealt with the language. However, it is Rated R, so what takes away from this movie is definitely the number of F bombs and MF bombs thrown around. Yes, I can expect that in the violent or argumentative situations, but........ the writers  definitely went overboard in my opinion.",1393027200,7,1093,4.834224598930481

5987200,4,B00FF9SKP8,"I'm a sucker for a love story...add poetry, passion, and hard truths...and I'm hooked!
I did think the parents situation didn't completely or neatly blend with the story, their acting was superb, but the writer shouldn't have so closely paralleled their situation of abuse with what was being vilified in Kal's marriage. That piece didn't feel as authentic to me as the other pieces of the storyline did.
I enjoyed seeing a healthy and loving relationship between Curtis and his brother and I also enjoyed smaller touches like Kal refer to her mother's friend as, ""Ma'm"". It spoke to the complexities of our characters that she could demonstrate respect for her elders, be in an abusive relationship, and dig a man who in the midst of her struggles, spoke to her being.
I'll end with this, Omari Hardwick is one of the sexiest men I've seen on the screen. Not just aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but the ear as well. The dichotomy between his intensity and gentle vulnerability came through the screen and captured me...absolutely beautiful!",1389657600,4,1045,4.909604519774011

Lover of Independent Black Films",1388793600,,411,4.426666666666667

5987243,4,B00FF9SKP8,"The ending was just what i needed and you need to watch the entire movie to get what it's really about, self-love. I would love to find the producers of this movie and ask them to take out the five minutes of the end and turn it into a PSA or something -- very powerful.

Additionally, the chemistry between the two actors, Shanola Hampton (NYC stand up!) and Omari Hardwick was amazing. It was raw and real... and I appreciate it. Life is just that not pretty always, it's raw and the profane is present. I would like to see more of this: Black Love Present on Screen with complex and complete characters showing the depth of life... of living. Of Black men being vulnerable and leaning in and saying that they need their partners. Of beautiful dark skinned women in leading roles. I am not saying that this should be the only thing that is shown I desire more of what this movie portrayed, Black love as I have experienced it. Thank you Anika MCFall and thank you to all the producers, writers, actors, assistants, stage hands... ( I think that all the types of roles that i now on a movie set!) Thank you.",1388534400,42,1108,4.378640776699029

5987246,5,B00FF9SKP8,This is a powerful movie that shows both the pain and rewards of making difficult changes.  Sometimes finding the ideal companion requires purging old ones holding back your life.,1388534400,,179,5.172413793103448
5987247,5,B00FF9SKP8,"Love this movie, the acting is excellent! I would recommend this to my friends. Stand out acting by Omari Hardwick and Shanola Hampton. This is the new Love Jones.",1388361600,,163,4.655172413793103

5987271,3,B00FF9SKP8,"This could of been a better movie. The cussing was unnessary. Poetry is a beautiful thing. You don't have to cuss. I think that it says alot about a person who cusses when they want to express themselves. Poetry should be adored by everyone, even children. So stop the cussing and find another way to express yourself. I'm tired of sisters disrespecting themselves and laying up with a man, and you are married to another. If he still lay up with you, he don't care about you, nor does he love you. Wake up people!! With those two things said, that's all I have to say. I would not buy this dvd if you don't like cussing when you hear poetry. Adultery! We see enough of that on the regular channels. Is there anyone out there trying to live like God have designed us too?",1388188800,,771,4.324137931034483

5987275,4,B00FF9SKP8,"I'm hearing the Love Jones comparison; the only similarities is the Poetry readings but it doesn't have the Love Jones Feel to me. However, it does stand on it's own as a near flawless Classic.  They got everything perfect in casting; Omari's a Beast as a leading Man.anything else would be beneath him..he makes all his leading ladies glow and magnify their Beauty. His chemistry with Shanola was really real; I felt she was infatuated with him in real life and had to remind herself she was Acting. I was immediately mesmerized by the beauty of her face in the opening sequence and braced myself for the ride..The whole Lauryn Hill vibe sold me instantly--I'm a dark, Chocolate Fanatic. However, that Bar scene woke me up and I felt the Movie was over; from there I started losing faith in the Kal character because it's very difficult to come to terms with her actions. Its not judging, it is what it is. What would have made the Movie a certified CLASSIC for me is if they would've made it a straight Boy meets girl Romance Movie and developed from there. Or made Ronnie a foggy backdrop to the story.  The Erotic Romance Novel thing I feel really took away from the the Intense chemistry between Omari and Shanola..They both have ""Heroic"" qualities I think we need to see in Afrian American films right now. Otherwise its an engaging film with exceptionally strong Acting. Despite my issues w Kal's character flaws (I wanted her to be my Dream girl So Badly)...Its a Solid film with Beautiful people..if you like your Black Sexy and Gorgeous, this is the Movie to see.",1387497600,,1573,4.634408602150538

5987277,5,B00FF9SKP8,"I loved this movie... and the fact that it involved poetry (well written poetry) was touching. The character ""Kal""...she says what women are all thinking.
