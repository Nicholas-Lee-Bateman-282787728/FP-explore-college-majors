8262416,4,B0016GOLTS,"This is an extraordinary movie, indeed. Manoj Kumar, Asha Parekh and Pran's acting are superb and the compositions of music director Ravi are nothing short of breathtaking.

On the musical side, Rafi really outshines everybody here with his melodious finale song ""Naseeb Mein"". His first two songs in this movie, namely ""Bhari Duniya"" and ""Raha Gardishon"", are certainly gems. But there is something in ""Naseeb Mein"" that does it for me. This is an immortal, unparalleled and sublime love song by Rafi at his peak. Lata is also excellent in ""Lo Aa Gaaee"", but its Rafi's unique voice that keeps resounding in your head long after watching the movie.

In a nutshell, ""Do Badan"" is a real gem of the 60's. Do not miss it, especially given the fact that nowadays movies aren't made like that anymore...",1302393600,,799,4.824817518248175
