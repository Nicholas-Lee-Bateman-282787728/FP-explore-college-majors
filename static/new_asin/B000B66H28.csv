2402839,4,B000B66H28,"I bought this DVD set because I had read that it contained a review of the reasons for the Civil War.  I was not disappointed.  This set contains three DVDs.  Particuarly the first of those has a good analysis of the reasons for the Civil War, but the others also have a good input.  The set contains an analysis of each battle of the Civil War, and although I have many DVDs accounting for the many battles, none have it wrapped up totally the way this set does.  I would recommend this DVD set to anyone interested in the reasons behind the Civil War and an analysis of every battle that took place.",1222992000,10,601,4.283185840707965

2402847,5,B000B66H28,"The Civil War was so bloody awful.  These battle sites are portrayed very well.  I've been too many of the battle fields and this DVD brings the action to  life, as horrible as it was.  Lots of extras.",1417392000,,201,4.2105263157894735

2402851,5,B000B66H28,"One of the best videos on the Civil War.  The battles, generals and strategies were thoroughly explained and events were shown in the order they happened. Very clear.",1410048000,,166,4.928571428571429

2402853,4,B000B66H28,"There is extensive content in chronological order (i.e. battles) with prologue about Generals, situations, strategies, maps, positions, outcomes and other information.  You can take it in several steps.  It includes reenactment footage with lots of shooting and canons. As stated, good or sufficient DVD quality.",1397174400,,312,5.911111111111111
2402854,5,B000B66H28,"excellent dvd of civil war battles, some history is skipped over, but this is done purposely due to time constraints I think. I love the narration by dale reed and the reenactments are really good and help put the words and situational dialogue to play. highly recommend this to anyone interested in the genre.  by far one of the best values I have had for all it offers. I have watched it many times and it doesn't get old, h",1384560000,,426,4.325
2402855,4,B000B66H28,"I would have prefered more maps during the monologue, but overall it seemed accurate. The extra comments were short and useless.",1383264000,,128,5.142857142857143
2402856,3,B000B66H28,"A good value and a decent introduction to the American Civil War. There were a few factual errors and use of a lot of stock footage,seen in other venues. But hard to beat for the price,and for a high school student studying history;this documentary fits the bill. Putting the battles in chronological order aids a student in understanding the war. Having taught history in the 1970's,this product would have been a great teaching aid. This video would make a great gift for any student studying the Civil War.",1380758400,2,509,4.795454545454546
2402857,4,B000B66H28,but not great the qualaty is not all that good but ok it covers some of the lesser none battles like south mt. so over all pretty good,1343520000,,134,3.8214285714285716
2402858,5,B000B66H28,"I bought for a fiend to watch at home and as soon as he got it he watched it and really enjoyed it, very informative and educational.",1319155200,,133,3.962962962962963
2402859,5,B000B66H28,"This is a nice chronological recounting of Civil War battles from the opening battle of First Manassas right down through the final battle at Appomattox.

The general format is as follows: First, the narrator uses large regional maps to explain the strategies and movements of the Confederate and Union armies.  Then, individual battles are examined in more detail.  An animated map of the battlefield is presented, showing the positions and movements of the two sides as they engage each other in battle.  Civil War reenactors restage the battle so we can see how it would have appeared in real life.  Many historical period photographs are presented.  Civil War historians provide expert commentary.

The DVD mostly covers the Eastern Theater.  Virtually all major battles in the East are presented, with only three exceptions: Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign is not mentioned.  The 1862 Peninsular Campaign and the 1864 Valley Campaign are mentioned only briefly.  But other than these three, everything else is covered.

The coverage of the Western Theater is much less complete.  The Battle of Shiloh is examined, and Sherman's Atlanta Campaign is recounted in detail.  Only brief mention is made of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Island Number 10 and Vicksburg.  There is no mention of the 1862 Mississippi River Campaign, the 1862 Kentucky-Tennessee Campaign, the Chattanooga Campaign, the 1864 Tennessee Campaign, or Sherman's March to the Sea.

The Far West and the Coastal War are given only spotty attention.

It should be noted that most of the Civil War took place in the East, and this DVD does an excellent job of covering that area.

I would like to encourage the producers of the Civil War Battles DVD to come out with a companion volume II that would concentrate more on the Western Theater, particularly Vicksburg and Sherman's March.  They could also fill in some of the gaps in the East (the Peninsular Campaign and the two Valley Campaigns), The Far West (Wilson's Creek, Pea Ridge, Glorieta Pass, Red River), and the Coastal War (Hampton Roads, Charleston, Plymouth, Fort Fisher, Fort Blakely).

I think any history buff or Civil War devotee would be well pleased with this DVD.  People who don't know much about the Civil War and are interested in learning more will find this DVD an excellent place to start.",1316995200,31,2328,5.044502617801047
8082249,5,B000B66H28,Nice little documentary on the Civil War. Great add to the Civil War collection.,1521504000,,80,4.785714285714286
8082250,3,B000B66H28,"The narrative by frequent THC host Dale Reed is good, and it does a good job of covering the major eastern battles (not so good with the west, not at all with the Trans-Miss) but I can't rate it any higher because of some blatantly wrong statements and for the prolonged re-enactments. For example four solid minutes of ""battle"" at the ""Mule Shoe"" (Spotsylvania) when it appears they found a hill somewhere and piled up logs to make it look like that bloody site just doesn't work for me. Personal preference, but I prefer the contemporary pictures and interviews than watching re-enactors shooting up in the air. Still not a bad dvd as it still provides an overview to some 15 or so different campaigns, an interesting introduction to the war, and a couple of separate chapters on Jackson and Grant. Only Shiloh and the Atlanta campaign get any western coverage. It also has ""play all"" for some 4 hours of continuous play. The music is never overwhelming, just the 4 minutes of gunfire.",1520726400,,987,4.67816091954023
