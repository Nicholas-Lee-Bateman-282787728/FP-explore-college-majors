8044728,5,B00075K83M,Love this DVD but I recommend that you go slower than indicated on dvd... it's an old video so bear that in mind. I have done the practice every morning for a month & LOVE IT (but I go slower pace).,1486944000,,198,3.8536585365853657

8044730,5,B00075K83M,This is an excellent DVD!  You have to take the time to watch the instruction/ educational version first. It is simplified and precise.  If you did the 30 min. daily exercises every morning - you WILL have a better back!  I wish there was another version with even more exercises!  Excellentby the way - I am a yoga instructor also.,1396396800,,332,4.483333333333333
8044731,5,B00075K83M,"Top 5 reasons this program is worth a shot:

1. It's quick. About 20 minutes for the quick version of the routine. After doing it for a week, you'll memorize the movements and then you can do this anywhere, anytime you want.

2. No special equipment required. A yoga mat and an arm strengthening band are nice to have but you can do this on the rug with your belt (or that ugly tie you'll never wear.)

3. No sun salutations or ""Namaste,"" just straight forward techniques to help your back.

4. No sweat. Admittedly, this one is probably just for me but one of the reasons I don't like to exercise everyday is the time suck. You need time to warm up, then sweat, then warm down and then shower and dress and that's 2 hours gone. You can do this in your PJs before bed and not feel like a gym rat.

5. It really helps! I've always had a weak back and then developed some leg pain after a nasty fall on icy steps. I lucked into the quick version of this routine on an exercise channel 10 years ago and I've been practicing ever since. If I go 3 days without it, I feel it. I was always avoiding activities that might hurt my back, I knew to ""lift with my legs,"" but I didn't know that my abdominal muscles were slacking off. Now my back and my abdominals are a team.",1390348800,2,1264,4.121951219512195
8044732,5,B00075K83M,"Dear One Star Rater....This DVD set does not cost $200.00. Now your concern has been addressed. It's $20, which is very reasonable.",1382140800,,131,5.0
8044733,1,B00075K83M,"I know this isn't a blog, but I'd like a reviewer to address the cost of 200. for this dvd set?",1310342400,,95,3.5714285714285716
8044734,3,B00075K83M,"I haven't had a chance to go through the 1 hour session, but the under 30-minute session went so quickly that I almost needed to hit pause in order to get into one position before she changed to the next.  If you are in a hurry and want something that will give you a bit of a workout but not give you deep stretches, the quick start might be fine.  However, if you are looking for a video with a short routine that allows you to stretch well, this is not one that I would recommend.",1280188800,,483,4.020833333333333
8044735,5,B00075K83M,"I have scoliosis in the lumbar area. My back pain was frequent and acute. After buying this DVD and doing the daily quick version 2-3 times a week, my pain slowly disappeared. I feel much better now, and I have to attribute it to this workout. Thanks Christa! I now practice yoga at a studio to complement this workout and it has truly made a difference in my life.",1241481600,7,365,4.304347826086956
8044736,5,B00075K83M,"This is very well done. The educational version of the routine is explicit in instruction, and also applies the stretches and exercises to daily life and the movement it entails. Although the bios and humor are sometines a bit much, they are done in a sincere and inoffensive manner, and in fact, simply allow the user to proceed at a gentle pace, and gain the full benefit of the work. Once viewed, it is easy to make the transition to the routine sans extras. By the time you have completed the routine, you will feel vey relaxed, but physically comfortable, energized, ready to do whatever the day calls for. Both instructors advise the user to make choices, follow their own body's guidance, and I found this to be very encouraging, and effective as well. It's a good addition to any yoga library.",1157500800,13,801,4.647887323943662
