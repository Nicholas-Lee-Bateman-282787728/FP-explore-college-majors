5621131,4,B00BH419CG,"With a name like ""The Falcon"" you might think the character is a mysterious crime fighter like ""The Shadow"" or ""The Whistler"", but ""The Falcon"" is more in the vein of ""The Saint"" or ""The Thin Man"" series -- The gentleman detective.  In fact, the first series with George Sanders was very ""The Saint"" - esque; which had The Falcon going to court because George Sanders was both The Saint and The Falcon and the powers that be didn't like the trademark infringement of The Falcon on The Saint.  Eventually Tom Conway, George Sander's brother, took over the role of The Falcon.  This collection of Tom Conway's Falcon is classy and sparkling.  It oddly seems more like a television series (again in the mode of Roger Moore's Saint), than full out movies; but fun, nonetheless.",1365292800,6,773,4.703703703703703
5621132,5,B00BH419CG,"One of my favorite DVD collections was the first septet of THE FALCON mysteries starring George Sanders and then passing the torch to his on-screen and real-life brother Tom Conway assuming the role. The first volume left me, of course, wanting to own the rest of the series. I was hoping that Warner Brothers would follow with a Volume 2, and now it has finally arrived and was definitely worth the wait.

Each one of these films here is a delight, with Conway sleuthing his way through various scenarios and proving to be an amusing lothario in each one. My particular favorite is ""The Falcon in Hollywood"", because it is not only a nifty-little mystery, but it is also a behind-the-scenes look at the RKO studio lot of the era. Very cool.

Although only 2 discs, the brief running time of each film makes for all six films to fit on the dual-layer DVDs with fine quality (and a great value!). All 6 films in the set have been remastered for the occasion, and are a distinct improvement from the fuzzy, contrasty television broadcasts (telling sign, no more cue-marks at reel changes!). Not only is the picture far improved, but the sound is robust and crystal clear, far beyond normal expectation for RKO B-pictures that are nearly 70 years old.

For any fan of The Falcon, or other mystery series of similar vintage, this collection is recommended with sincere praise.",1364601600,35,1372,4.708333333333333

The Falcon In Hollywood  1944

The Falcon's Alibi  1946
The Falcon's Adventure  1946

I've always enjoyed the old Falcon mystery movies series from the 1940's, especially after Tom Conway took over the role. This DVD set is all Tom Conway and presents his final films as the Falcon. These are all well-made films that move along at a rapid pace (especially ""The Falcon In Hollywood""), have interesting characters, and some comic relief. My favorite is ""The Falcon In San Francisco"", but there's not one of them that's a bad film, and they're fun to watch late in the evening when you don't want to see any of the ""entertainment"" offered on broadcast TV or cable.

This is a 2-DVD set with 3 films on each disc. Although the old RKO films are great, the packaging of the DVD set is below average and could have easily been made more appealing by Warner Brothers simply by choosing a more colorful lobby card for the cover. Same with the first volume that was issued last year. And I don't believe any ""restoration"" work was done on these films for DVD release.  I recorded the first four of these six films off TCM about 5 years ago onto DVD-Rs, and TCM presented them in high quality; I think the quality of what TCM presented is about as good as the official DVD release now. I'm also wondering about the final three Falcon films from 1948 and 1949, ""The Devil's Cargo"", ""Appointment With Murder"", and ""Search For Danger"", all of which starred John Calvert as the Falcon. I've never seen them, maybe they aren't worthwhile series entries, but could have been a nice bonus to include them here as a third disc which I'm sure wouldn't be any skin off anyone's teeth.

Highly recommended. If you have ever enjoyed watching just one of Tom Conway's ""Falcon"" movies or like old 1940s black and white mystery films, don't skip picking this up.

UPDATE (APRIL 2017): ""The Devil's Cargo"" with John Calvert as the Falcon has been posted on YouTube. Based on trying to watch this one film, I'd say it's just as well the  ""lost"" Falcon films remain lost. ""Devil's Cargo"" is a poverty row film production that makes the Charlie Chan Monogram films shine by every comparison (and yes, I like the Chan Monograms).",1363996800,56,2286,4.603448275862069

5621170,5,B00BH419CG,"Tom Conway took over the role of The Falcon from George Saunders, essentially from the 4th movie onward, and made it his own. And in my opinion, he made a better fit for the Falcon as well.  While the Falcon and the Co-Eds is my favorite, perhaps because it combines a lot of humor with the mystery (and gives a chuckle to anyone over 30 who's had someone younger refer to them as 'elderly'!!!), all of these movies are gems...well done, well acted, and only occasionally weak scripts.

Today's TV and movies could learn a lot from the folks that made these movies back in the day....and not just to steal plots from them (which of course, if you watch the entire series, you'll realize the studio system also 'copied' plots from other movies and books...but I guess some things never change.)

George Sanders did both characters near simultaneously with style and debonair charm. For whatever reason, his depictions as the Falcon were taken over by Tom Conway, who ended up doing a very nice job filling in for the iconic Sanders. Mr Conway's style was almost identical to that of Mr Sanders, debonair and witty. And the Falcon hardly ever met a woman he didn't try to charm. The Falcon is one of those characters that always seems able to get mixed up in crimes, murders and whatnot despite just simply minding his own business. Many beautiful women seek him out to solve the mysteries that endanger or perplex them. While there is some similarity to all the movies - people need help, Falcon saves the day, Falcon frustrates bumbling cops - there is enough difference to keep it all entertaining. And of course, it's all just a pretense to display the undeniable Falcon charm. Worthy of space on your DVD shelf (along with the Sanders collection, too!)",1379203200,13,1131,4.746192893401015

However RKO studios have provided us with six films which in their day were big hits with the public, and are still very entertaining and all quite different today.
I'm sure you'll enjoy.",1367798400,5,364,4.447761194029851

5621212,5,B00BH419CG,"I love old movies from the 30's and 40's.  These are some of the best.  I had originally seen many of these movies on HBO and Cinemax late at night and had recorded about 8 of them on VHS.  I bought the fist volume of Falcon movies when it came out and was delighted to have some of the movies I recorded now on DVD plus a few extra.  This collection replaces the rest of the VHS recordings I had upgrading them to DVD and adds a few more new ones to my collection.  It is nice to be ride of a few more old VHS tapes of movies I love that were hard to find on DVD.  There are still a few Falcon movies made back in the 40's that are not yet included, hopefully there will be a volume 3 out soon to complete the set.",1367193600,11,715,3.7972972972972974
5621213,4,B00BH419CG,"In the case of the Falcon series, Conway IS the Falcon, while brother, George Sanders, was hardly more than an early fill-in.  Sanders was my favorite Saint, but his efforts to recreate the Saint with the Falcon series wasn't his best move, but in comes Conway and the Falcon takes wing.  Get both Series 1 and 2 and judge for yourself.",1367020800,6,336,4.491803278688525
