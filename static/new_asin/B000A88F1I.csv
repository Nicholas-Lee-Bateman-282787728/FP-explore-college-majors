8076142,5,B000A88F1I,"Just watched this DVD over the weekend. Now I want to buy it!  The passion for Christ is so evident, the worship songs so inspiring, and the musical and vocal talents are amazing.  I never knew how good this group was/is.  The songs may be 'dated' due to age, but they are current as they lead to pure worship. The bonus song (which I wish was in the movie portion) Arise my Love is simply awe inspiring and goose bump creating.  I cannot say enough about this DVD.  I can only imagine what it was like to be there.  Close yourself off with God in a quiet time and enjoy the worship experience.",1517184000,,594,4.212389380530974

8076146,5,B000A88F1I,"This DVD project is absolutely anointed.  My wife and I will periodically watch it during late evening (after the kids are in bed) in order to cleanse our minds and hearts from the daily influences of the world, and to set our minds upon things above before retiring for sleep.  Alas, I was saddened to learn that two key members of NewSong (Michael O'Brien and Scotty Wilbanks) left the group not long after this project was completed.  However, the Lord directs the hearts of those who seek Him, and His ways are far above our ways.  Interestingly, I recently noticed on their website ([...]) that they have revived a 2007 Rescue tour.  Can't keep a good band down!",1196467200,2,667,4.61864406779661
8076147,5,B000A88F1I,"This is a fantastic DVD - it makes me wish I could worship within a larger venue more often.  The disc takes about 2 hours to watch, from the actual concert, to extras and bonus features.  I never realized how talented this group truly is.  Each singer and musician play several instruments, and they all play them with passion and put their whole bodies into their performances.

You get more than your money's worth for the cost of this DVD.  I suspect the cots itself is less than the ticket to get into the venue.  A very good value if you love worship music or are fans of the band.",1151193600,6,587,4.290909090909091
