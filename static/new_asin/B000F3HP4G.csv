Great!",1303516800,5,235,5.051282051282051
2550217,5,B000F3HP4G,"I have been a fan of Yuri Norshtein's work since I first saw his animation film ""The tale of tales"" at 14 years old many years ago. These animation films are very poetic, nostalgic and beautiful. They're also made using a custom-made technique that re-creates fog, perspective and facial mimics - back in the 1970s! The films are slow paced, which is rare now. I have shown and given this as a present to my friends in Spain, Denmark and USA, and they all loved it. This is the best of the best of Russian animation.",1220745600,17,516,4.385416666666667
2550218,5,B000F3HP4G,"i was in russia last summer and happened to stumble upon a children's book called ""hedgehog in the fog"".  im not fluent enough to have read the whole book, but the pictures were beautiful enough to make me buy it.  with further research i found out about the cartoon, etc, and the minute i saw it on youtube i looked everywhere for a copy to buy.
these are literally some of the most beautiful animations i have ever seen.  the stories and the characters are absolutely wonderful.  it really puts you in a beautiful place for a while.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE!!",1197331200,18,566,4.519607843137255
2550219,5,B000F3HP4G,"I love ""Triplets of Bellville"" and I admire ""Spirited Away"" but Yuri Norstein's ""Skazka skazok (Tale of Tales)"" (1979) is the pinnacle of the genre - what Tarkovsky did in Zerkalo, Norstein had also achieved in his 30 minutes film that was made 28 years ago. His incredible images accompanied by the music of Mozart, Bach, and the famous tango ""The Wayworn Sun"" - the same one Nikita Mikhalkov used in his film ""Burnt by the Sun"" - bring to life forever gone but always alive in one's heart happiness, innocence, and memory of the childhood that are indelible from the history of the country and the Artist's search for the beauty and meaning. The images or the war are absolutely heartbreaking. There are no combats on the screen but the scenes with the dancing couples, the men going to the war, and the notifications of death (""pochoronki"") flying like birds of death to waiting in hope women: mothers, wives, and sisters are unforgettable. Norstein is known for being a perfectionist - his resume besides ""Tale of Tales"" includes only five films - combined, they last less than 80 minutes:

""25th - The First Day"" (1968)(10 minutes)  is Norstein's first film which he dedicated to the first day of the October Revolution of 1917. Norstein combines poetry of V. Mayakovsky, with motifs of K. Malevich and images from K. Petrov-Vodkin, A. Deneka, V. Tatlin, S. Chehonin, P. Filonov, N. Altman, and Yuri Piminov, The score is taken from the 11th and 12th symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich.

""The Battle Of Kerjenets"" (1971) (10 minutes)  - Fresco and icon paintings in the traditions of the old Russian masters are combined with music from Rimsky Korsakov's opera ""Tale of the Invisible City Kitezh"" to describe the struggle of Russians against foreign invaders.

""Fox And Rabbit"" (1973)(12 minutes)  and ""Heron And Crane"" (1974) (10 minutes)  are based on Russian Fairy Tales. ""Heron and Crane"" marks the beginning of Norstein's collaborations with his wife, the artist Francesca Yarbusova, and a cameraman Alexander Zhukovsky.

""Hedgehog In The Fog"" (1975)(10 minutes) is considered by many along with ""Tale of Tales"" (29 minutes)  the best animated film ever made. It is ""a little fairy tale"" about a hedgehog that one evening, as usual, went to see his friend the bear cub and count the stars and on his way, got lost in the thick fog.

Every minute of every film is perfection itself. Norstein puts a piece of his heart in every single frame of his small gems. He is the Artist and the Humanist - one of the best directors ever, and not only in Animation.",1170374400,39,2561,4.813211845102506
8116810,5,B000F3HP4G,"Yuri Norstein's incredible cutout animations are all assorted in this DVD.
From children to adults, anybody would enjoy it with the painstaking but such a rewarding cutout animation maybe only Russians could be able to make.
Especially, 'Tale of Tales' would be the cream of the crop.
After watching it, everyone would agree Yuri Norstein is a Dostoevsky in cutout animation field, indeed.
A must-see.",1488326400,,401,5.184615384615385

The copies though supplied on this video are not the highest quality, I saw better versions on a PAL format DVD from Russia (no English subtitles though).
