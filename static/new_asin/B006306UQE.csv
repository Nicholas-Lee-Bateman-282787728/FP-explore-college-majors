4934162,1,B006306UQE,Although convenient.  The online video solution on my Sony XBR is of poor quality.  I would not recmmend this solution for video delivery.  I will not buy another.  The original picture is about 10% of the screen and when magnified the video quality in unacceptable.,1348876800,,266,4.844444444444444
4934163,5,B006306UQE,"I just watched All. I.Can and flamed them for their crap movie. Maybe it was ok, 2 stars tops, I gave it 1. Probably because I just watched Attack of la nina!

So this movie has rad footage, a sick soundtrack, the whole thing is funny and I loved it, watched it 5 times in the last week.

I will never watch all. I.cant again, but Attack of la nina is going on repeat for a while.

Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed unless you hate pow and hucks.",1333929600,2,457,4.0
