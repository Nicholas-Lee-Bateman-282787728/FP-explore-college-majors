8424328,4,B004CZZZ9K,A late 1950's not bad by-the-numbers plane in peril film.  Captained by a stiff-necked pilot who raises his son like he's in the army.  While struggling to keep the plane flying until they reach assistance he learns some tolerance and good parenting skills.  The plane is filled with the usual stereotypical potential crash victims.  A pretty OK time-passer.  The Sony Pictures Collection DVD-R is very good quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.,1523750400,,452,5.123287671232877
8424329,4,B004CZZZ9K,"It wasn't difficult to rope me into this people and plane in peril story . first off , I really like films about airplanes and their passengers in danger . Gary Merrill who I'd first seen in the 1950 picture All About Eve many years previously and in perhaps a dozen and a half motion pictures subsequently was a big draw . Additionally the film would afford me my second opportunity to see Nancy Davis since seeing Donovan's Brain some years back . I own a terrific boxed set of Ronald Reagan films but wanted to see some more of Nancy's film work . She has a pretty small part but is quite good in this outing .
I liked the whole film and the various characters and the need to land the airplane at sea . Although the miniature work was a bit wanting , the passengers and crew have quite good dialogue and realistic personalities and story lines . Prolific director Fred Sears does good work with a limited budget and so on . If some of the above applies to you , you may just find yourself enjoying the proceedings as well .",1518912000,,1027,4.244897959183674

8424332,3,B004CZZZ9K,"I have not yet seen this movie from 1958. However, the film is based on an actual event, known as ""Pan Am Flight 6."" -- a passenger plane ditched in the Pacific Ocean in Oct of 1956. I know, because my family was supposed to have been on that flight out of Hawaii, but we changed our tickets the day before the flight. Our families state-side saw that the flight had ditched in the ocean, and they thought we were on it! Rather a lot of excitement before my father informed everyone of our changed flight plans. If you want the true history of the heroic Captain Ogg, who saved all the passengers aboard that flight, read about it on Wikipedia. Look up ""Pan Am Flight 6"" to find out the details! ""Crash Landing,"" the film, was based on that actual 1956 event.",1408924800,4,759,4.314685314685315
8424333,4,B004CZZZ9K,"Film at first revolves around the passengers lives, as the engine trouble starts immediately into the movie, then we flashback to how everyone got here.  The rest of the film involves preparations for a water ditching on two engines, near an American destroyer that is on maneuvers in mid-ocean.  The film is very similar to other disaster movies.  Not quite as good as The High And The Mighty, but we get an actual ditching here.

The aircraft is a Douglas DC-7C, en route from Lisbon to New York, which had only been in service for a couple of years, and the airline is unnamed.  The exterior model work is fair to good by todays standards. When the plane hits the water, we are actually seeing the Lockheed R6V Constitution, so we are probably seeing footage of a radio control model used for ditching tests. The flight crew doesn't always seem as cohesive or professional as it could be, but this is for dramatic tension.  The evacuation was probably filmed on a ditching trainer that Douglas or an airline would have had for a new aircraft in service.

The ship is identified in radio call sign and on one of the motor lifeboats as DE347, but the USS Jesse Rutherford was supposedly in mothballs during this time.  Besides footage of the DE steaming around in circles, there is a shot of the actor playing the captain outside the bridge, and preparations of a motor lifeboat.  But the hull number is painted out, and the lifeboat number is obscured.",1338336000,9,1454,4.626459143968872
