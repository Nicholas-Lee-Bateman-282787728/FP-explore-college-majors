1218044,4,B00000GIHM,"This once lost film is actually quite enjoyable. The special effects that destroy New York are fantastic, however the melodramatic (And I mean MELODRAMATIC) acting and soap opera style stories detract from the over all enjoyability. Although not my favorite film, I'm glad that I own it and will forever be greatful to the lucky person who stumbled upon the lost and only print and gave it to film buffs.",981849600,7,404,4.785714285714286

1218048,4,B00000GIHM,"Early disaster film is highlighted by astonishing for the time special effects and exceptional performance by Peggy Shannon. Predates H.G.

1218049,4,B00000GIHM,"Interesting very early disaster film.  The first half covers the destruction of civilization, done with stock footage and some fairly nice model work; this section has a great feeling of urgency and rising dread.  The second half follows our hero and heroine as they become involved with a community of survivors.  (The cause of the destruction is an asteroid which passes near the earth; although that's never explicitly stated, the movie refers to an unexpected eclipse of the moon, and you get to put the pieces together yourself.)  Peggy Shannon has great screen presence.  The story was interesting, although you have a pretty good idea where it's heading, thanks to seeing similar stuff ever since; but the movie gets points for being there first.  This is much more accessible to a modern audience than the similar movie End of the World.
The restoration is lovely, with good picture and sound.",1488067200,5,901,4.973333333333334
1218050,5,B00000GIHM,This is not a review since the Kino Blu-ray hasn't been release yet but this should be a must for all who love the disaster films genre. The Blu-ray will be the first time since the 1930's that you be able to see and hear the original soundtrack in English. Also a new restoration has been done from a recently found print found in France and should blow away the old US VHS and Italian DVD that used the first found print from the 1980's with only Italian language and very poor video quality.,1486252800,2,494,4.26595744680851
1218051,5,B00000GIHM,"""Deluge"" is an historically important film.
Also cheezy and fun.
For the first time on film, New York City is destroyed by an earthquake and tidal wave.
Five minutes of well-done miniature work and rear-screen projection.

-- 1933: ""Deluge"" produced by RKO (same studio, same year as ""King Kong"")
It was a rough year for New York.
-- 1940: Republic Pictures bought the New York destruction footage and used it in ""S.O.S. Tidal Wave"", and the serials ""Dick Tracy vs Crime Inc"" (1941) and ""King of the Rocket Men"" (1949).
But they weren't interested in the rest of the film.
RKO went bankrupt later in the decade (eventually bought by Howard Hughes).
""Deluge"" was believed to be a lost film.
-- 1981: A dubbed version of ""Deluge"" was discovered in Italy: ""La Distruzione del Mondo"".
Later subtitled into English and released on VHS tape.
-- 2016: The nitrate dupe negative with the English soundtrack was discovered in a warehouse.
-- 2017: Second official release of ""Deluge"" - 84 years after the first release. Hooray!

For the curious, the entire 5 minute, 11 second destruction of New York scene from ""Deluge"" is available on-line.
The ending is very artsy.
It's from the Italian-dubbed, English subtitled VHS tape.

Decent picture (it still has a lot of scratches) and very clear soundtrack.
Kino Lorber comissioned a very well-done commentary track.
English SDH subtitles for the main film (not the bonus features).

This is an early Sidney Blackmer film, and one of the few times he played the romantic lead.
Blackmer (1895-1973) was usually typecast as the villain; often as a corrupt businessman.
If ""Deluge"" was filmed a few years later, Sidney Blackmer would have tried to swindle widows and orphans out of their newly created beachfront property.

This is very much a pre-code film.
Female star Peggy Shannon plays an Olympic swimmer, giving her an excuse to wear a bikini in much of the film (they didn't become popular in America until after World War II).
The threat of rape in post-apocalyptic New York is a major theme (termed ""molestation"" in the film).

Also included:
""Back Page"" a 1934 B-Movie (Pyramid Films) starring Peggy Shannon, whose career never really took off.
IMDB synopsis: ""Peggy Shannon plays a young female reporter who is fired from a big city newspaper, then decides to take over a troubled small town newspaper. She encounters difficulties with small town politics, getting advertisers to help keep the paper afloat, and issues with 1930's feminism...""

Plus a preview of the other major disaster film from the 1930s: ""The Hurricane"" (1937) directed by John Ford:

A Pacific Island is destroyed by a tidal wave.
More miniature work + a lot of actors getting really wet on MGM's back lot.
Starring Jon Hall, Dorothy Lamour, Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, Thomas Mitchell, C. Aubrey Smith.
Dorothy Lamour's Tahitian costume (1937) is chaste in comparison to Peggy Shannon's swimsuit (1933)
The Hollywood Production Code went into effect between the two films.

and previews from two cheesy 1970's disaster flicks: ""Avalanche""  starring Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow, and ""Meteor"" starring Sean Connery and Natalie Wood.

""Deluge"" was the first feature film directed by 22 year-old Felix Feist, who went on to a thirty year career of B-movies, short subjects and television.

1218054,2,B00000GIHM,"The destruction of the world was just meant to set up the drama concerning how various men would treat women if there were no law to influence their behavior. We have Jasper the brute, who only wants to possess the woman. A fearful creep who wants to violate her and the decent man who wants to love her. Primitive but interesting because of the age of the film.",1335744000,3,362,4.338235294117647
1218055,3,B00000GIHM,"In lieu of so many recent Armegeddon films, depicting major world wide disasters, this was one of the first. It also shares many of those uneven flaws that most films of this genre too often suffer from: Spectacular devastation scenes counterbalanced with droll melodrama.  The first twenty minutes are very tense and even frightening as scientists discover that the world's weather has gone haywire; earthquakes and gigantic floods are taking their ecological and human toll, and a brutal global storm is brewing out on the horizon.  For a change, no pseudo scientific reason for the disaster is offered, so the story takes on that dark, mysterious twilight zone aspect. The highlight is the astounding destruction of New York, as it is obliterated by one hell of a gargantuan tidal wave (ominously foreshadowing When Worlds Collide). For the time it was made, the F/X are surprisingly not that bad and show some creative ingenuity in that pre digital CGI era. I can imagine audiences being really stunned by it back then, for it has that grim, nightmarish nihilistic edge, that Hollywood usually shies away from. The major flaw is that all the mayhem occurs in the first reel, and, thus,  the rest of the story concerns a handfull of survivors and their usual melodramatic ordeals, (love triangle and all), and it all considerably pales in comparison to the compelling beginning (though it does deal slightly with the rape/murders of a few of the women.  Daring for the time, which was also at the end of that pre code era).  When your greatest scenes happen too early on, the rest will inevitably become anti climatic, and thereby hangs the film's biggest, unfortunate drawback.  Frankly, the whole film should have centered upon the destruction of the world, and all the mounting tension and sense of impending doom leading up to it.  That could have been a truly frightening classic. Nevertheless, Deluge is still quite impressive considering its age, more of a historical curio, but it is the precursor to most other disaster films that came many decades later.  I suspect that Irwin Allen may have caught this back in his school boy days, as well as those responsible for Deep Impact, Independence Day and Armegeddon. (Not that I think that highly of them, for they tend to slip more into that 'interesting failure'  grouping that far too many potentially great classics too often do).All quibbles aside, Deluge is still worth taking a keen look at, in spite of it's ""old school"" shortcomings, but as an early cinematic F/X experiment, it remarkably carves it's own innovative niche. I still feel that the great definitive classic end of the world film has still yet to be made.",1058486400,,2685,4.922566371681416
7909097,2,B00000GIHM,"I like vintage movies, but this was just awful.  From the predawn cave man attitudes to the fact it has some OK period special effects, then it just turned into another love interest melodrama.  Awful.",1514246400,,201,4.714285714285714
7909098,5,B00000GIHM,"Another restoration that shows how far we have come.  If you can stand the early silliness, there is lots to appreciate.  Not for kids--but I might have seen it as a kid, I'm so old.  The model work was delightful for its day I admit, but don't dare compare to CGI.  The Bad Guys belong in an old western.  The plot about the decay of society still works, and the townsfolk versus the gangsters has not disappeared.  Sweet to see Pre-Code semi-nudity of a lovely girl.  That would have been cut for TV Primetime.  Ah, gone but not forgotten.  Restorations rule!",1506211200,,561,4.475247524752476

7909102,4,B00000GIHM,"DELUGE is a fascinating ""lost"" film from the early sound era. Of particular interest is the extensive destruction footage, with miniatures supervised by the legendary Ned Mann.  Prior to this DVD and Blu-ray being available, the only way one could see the dynamic miniature effects was as stock shots in Republic serials.  The film itself is a rather pedestrian ""survival after the catastrophe"" tale.",1500768000,,400,5.234375
7909103,4,B00000GIHM,"BOTTOM LINE: One of cinema's earliest apocalyptic efforts. The drama is obvious and heavy-handed at times, but that's par for the course on a film this vintage. Some surprisingly decent F/X give this flick a few visual jolts. Decent bonus content, including a complete second feature, BACK PAGE, starring DELUGE co-star Peggy Shannon. If you love discovering older, obscure films then this is a real find. Recommended. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Bizarre weather patterns turn decidedly deadly, coalescing on a global scale. Inevitably, worldwide cataclysm occurs, wiping most of mankind's architectural achievements from the face of the earth. A scattered handful of battered survivors attempt to piece together society again. The narrative focuses primarily on two individuals, bound by fate to change each other's lives... and affect the lives of those around them.

THOUGHTS: I'd never heard of this film until spotting its recent release on Blu-ray here at Amazon. It's fairly standard melodrama stuff, but gets a real shot in the arm thanks to some ingenious practical visual effects which nicely detail the end of civilization. The acting is pretty obvious and stilted, but this early End Of The World epic is still an entertaining watch. You can clearly see its influence on many similarly-themed movies shot years or even decades later; right up to today, in fact. DELUGE is fun stuff, and well worth a look. Younger viewers and those with short attention spans may be bored but classic film buffs, collectors and disaster film fans are eagerly encouraged to check this one out.

THE BLU-RAY: The folks at Kino Lorber have done it again by unearthing another cinematic obscurity. The clean up is pretty impressive. For a film that's more than 85 years old, that's no small achievement. Video presentation is mostly clear & clean, with minimal crush and pixelization. Audio portion is equally clear & strong. Bonus content includes an interesting fact-filled audio commentary track by Rich Smith, some movie trailers and, best of all, a complete second feature film (BACK PAGE) that stars DELUGE's Peggy Shannon. Both features clock in at around 70 minutes.",1496534400,4,2157,5.174785100286533
7909104,4,B00000GIHM,"The blu-ray of this seldom-seen film is excellent.  And the film itself has more than a few surprises, especially given when it was made.  The SFX sequence of ""the world"" being destroyed holds up surprisingly well, and is worth getting the film for old-school SFX fans.  Definitely recommended for fans of old school films, special effects, and did I mention dystopias?  Yeah.  Give it a try -- on DVD if not on blu.",1495670400,,416,4.6438356164383565
