8302076,3,B000A88F5E,"This movie is somewhat boring, because it is about two people and all we see mostly is just two people, since they're stranded on an island, we see no one else. They fight and I guess it's suppose to be funny when they do, but then they fall in love. I think the movie falls under category of romantic comedy, but it's neither funny or romantic. Only thing good about movie is that Raquel Welch looks sexy even in her later years. Plus when bad guys arrive on the scene at the end, the action doesn't last long, and it's disappointing how bad guys get defeated too easily. I guess the bad guys were after this secret stash of cocaine or heroin, whatever drug it was, but it doesn't fit in the movie because it's suppose to be a romantic comedy.",1210809600,7,744,4.283687943262412
8302077,2,B000A88F5E,"""Paradise"" is actually the coast of Australia, where this 1989 made-for-TV adventure was filmed. Raquel Welch stars as a rich, spoiled socialite who is shipwrecked on a desert island. Her only companion is boozy, unkempt Aussie Jack Thompson. Before the film has a chance to turn into Lina Wertmuller's Swept Away (or even Gilligan's Island), Welch and Thompson are up to their necks in intrigue. Better to see ""Six Days and Seven Nights"", Same plot - better story. Better to see ""Fathom"", different Raquel - better bathing suit.",1207180800,18,529,5.0227272727272725
8302078,5,B000A88F5E,The age old story of a ship wrecked couple is given new life in this quirky and funny romance. Well Worth Seeing. I give it five stars.,1026950400,11,135,4.037037037037037
