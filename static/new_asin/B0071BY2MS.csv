8508144,4,B0071BY2MS,"This is one of the Weston Woods/ Scholastic DVD series that brings high quality children's picture books to life through animation and excellent narrators.  This one contains...
1.  Chicken Little by Ed Emberley - This is a modern, humorous take on the classic tale.  The sky is falling, the sky is falling.
2.  The Great White, Man-Eating Shark - When Norvin, a boy who looks a lot like a shark, decided to scare away all the other swimmers with a fake shark fin, he does not count on a real shark showing up.
3.  The Three Legged Cat - A cat with a peg leg wishes for more adventures, while his owner wishes for a calmer cat.  All works out well when the owners brother accidently puts the cat on his head instead of his fur hat.
4.  Dooby, Dooby, Moo - This is brilliantly read by singer Randy Travis.  All our friends from Click, Clack Moo are back in this story about Farmer Brown's animals trying out for a talent show at the county fair.
I gave this DVD four stars because it is very good, but some of the other Weston Woods DVDs are just a little better.  Nothing wrong with this one, however.",1517184000,,1101,4.305825242718447
