8634464,5,B00HQWJMD6,I first saw this movie on a flight to China in 2011.  The person next to me was watching it and I was pretty much ignoring the movie since it was in Japanese with English subtitles - was too tired to read after being on plane so long.  But I got caught up in the tale unwillingly.  I chose it and watched from the beginning.  It is a story of discovery and loyalty for a man and his dog.  The man has pretty much lived his life as others expect - never really being happy but not having the courage to change anything.  An event in his life changes that.  It's not a film for people who enjoy happy endings but it is very thought-provoking.  It makes a person think about their own life and about the choices they have made.,1419638400,,724,4.085106382978723
