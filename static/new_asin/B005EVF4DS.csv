8469092,5,B005EVF4DS,Australian Surfing History. Covers the transitional period of surfing very well. Growing up in So Cal they bring back many care free memories of surfing in the mid to late 60's. These films are very well done and should be in any true surfer's film library!! A BIG thumbs UP............,1385424000,,286,4.74
