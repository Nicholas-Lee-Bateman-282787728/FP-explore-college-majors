8351216,5,B0025VLHA4,Who can resist Tiffany Shepis and a dorm full.of zombies. Lots of cute actresses and it gets VERY bloody. . .like a zombie movie should,1518048000,,135,4.44
8351217,1,B0025VLHA4,"The movie opens with gratuitous nudity and zombie kills. We don't know where they come from, but they have abnormal strength and blueish faces. The dialouge was juvenile, in a Pee-Wee Herman sort of way. You can hear the wind whistle through the outside microphone.

The classroom scene looks like the teacher and student segment where filmed at different times as the lighting and sound vary greatly as the conversation goes back and forth. The mismatch is again repeated when Sarah is called to the admin building and speaks to an administrator of the college who looks younger than her. She sounds crisp, while the administrator sounds like he is in a fishbowl. He sits at a desk with a wooden brown top. Sarah (Ciara Richards of Chainsaw Cheerleaders) sits across from him and the desk top is white. Like the classroom, we never see the two people having the conversation together at the same time.

So pathetic it is funny.

Adrianna Eder, who play Allison is one of the movie's worst actors as she attempts to deliver trite and predictably bad lines with conviction. Andrea Owenby has a small role as the side kick of Clare.",1342224000,,1130,4.725888324873097

8351219,1,B0025VLHA4,"I love a good low budget horror movie. I can usually find something decent about most of them. This one has got me stumped for anything good to say. A few of the actresses were cute and could act on a fifth grade level. The story was laughable, the sets were unsed store rooms with no trying to disguise them and the dilogue was being read off cuecards, or so it seemed.
  The biggest problem was that the main antagonist was added after the movie was shot. You never see her with any other actor, save one, and the one is also never with the others. It shows this girl, cuts to a reaction to what she says or does, but never on camara at the same time. They would have been better off to leave her out completely. It is like she was the girl friend of the director or she was blackmailing him to get her in this.
  Please, do yourself a favor and forget this movie even exists.",1268438400,,878,4.116959064327485
8351220,2,B0025VLHA4,Only buy this one if you need to own all things zombie related.  I gave it 2 stars for effort and extra feature.,1245110400,,112,3.869565217391304
