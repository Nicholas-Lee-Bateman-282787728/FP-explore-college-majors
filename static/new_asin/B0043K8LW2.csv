4255933,5,B0043K8LW2,This shows a side of Hugh Hefner not many people know about.  A must see film for fans and critics alike!!,1346889600,,106,4.0476190476190474
4255934,4,B0043K8LW2,"I'll admit to idolizing Hefner as a kid, but as an adult I've found his persona to be somewhat grotesque.  Sure, I'd be a hypocrite if I said I wouldn't want to be his age (or any age) and have his options available to me, but I'd like to think that I'd behave differently.  Perhaps I wouldn't.

The only time I typically see film footage of Hefner is when he's gawking at his posse of babes and making weird laughing noises.  I find it kind of creepy.  The movie, however, let me see another side of him.  I was pleasantly surprised.  He's intelligent and certainly, for a period time, he was an innovator.  Moreover, I applaud him for supporting civil rights.

Some could say that this movie was made to show Hefner in a positive light.  No argument there.  Nevertheless, I'm glad that I had an opportunity to see that there's a whole lot more to the man than I had previously been exposed to.",1334016000,,895,4.363636363636363
4255935,1,B0043K8LW2,"Nothing like A Canadian funded movie to prop up a Megalomaniac's ego,The Man who always wears pajams credits himself and his softcoresmut enterprise with Everything associated with what's ""Right"" according to him and some of those interviewed,Women's rights,(Ironic),Abortion/contraceptives,and of course He won a NAACP(that should tell you how sad and radical the organization became)Award. If that doesn't make you laugh you have so-called ""Reverend""Jesse on here(Hymeytown?)I am surprised Sharpton and Cornel West was not on here? these so-called ""activists"" sold their souls and love the limelight. Then you have ""comedian"" Gregory who takes potshots and takes the usual flawed joke about The Church and little boys. Basically with the exception of a Feminist I actually agree with(I am far from a feminist supporter) and Pat Boone,And the William F Buckley Jr Interview. All you have is one sad Degenerate who thinks the world owes him accolades for everything,I am surprised he does not take credit for inventing the wheel and Mickey Mouse.",1332633600,,1046,5.462962962962963
4255936,5,B0043K8LW2,After seeing several ads in Playboy about this dvd I decided to buy it and it is one of my most favorite dvds in my library. I have watched it and was amazed at the information about Mr. Hefner I didn't know. I would say it is a must see for anyone who is interested in this man. It shows he was color blind on who was performing on his TV shows and his Playboy Clubs. He gave a chance to new talent that maybe some people never new about. I would definitely recommend buying this dvd.,1319241600,,485,4.010309278350515
4255937,4,B0043K8LW2,"Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel are more than a mere celebration of buxom women and the man who chooses them for his magazine cover.  It connects the dots on the life and times of Hugh Hefner and his contribution to popular culture.

Delving back to the 1950s origins of Playboy the documentary explores how this publication opened the doors for feminist, racial equality, and free speech.
With a wide array of commentaries from a wide cast of individuals like Gene Simmons, Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Tony Bennett, the portrait weaves is of an individual that used his new found influence to bring about change.  It is interesting to see bits from his television show and the wide range of individuals that were promoted and influenced by their relationship with Hefner.

At times the pace can be a bit slow and redundant but overall this documentary does a good job of making you think of how much our popular culture has changed within the Playboy era.

Throughout the documentary Hefner shares candid insight into his thoughts and feelings of what was going on at that particular time be it the 50s or the 10s.  At 85, Hefner still is living the dreams of the boy from the mid west who was seeking love and happiness.",1314835200,3,1227,4.683720930232558
4255938,5,B0043K8LW2,"This documentary is an eye opener on how Hef started the magazine and how Playboy, the company, shaped civil rights and women's rights in the 1950s/60s. A lot of information in this movie is also in the book Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and The American Dream by Steven Watts, with the book going into greater details, but by far an intriguing documentary. I like how the filmmaker uses cartoons based on Hef's early drawings to tell the story of Playboy and Hef's life. I was lucky enough to go to the premiere with Hef in attendance and I could see the looks on his face throughout the film, he really enjoyed it even with more criticizing points of Playboy mentioned by feminists. Definitely not the Playboy ideas/images I grew up with, but insightful to know how Playboy used to be in those time eras.",1303171200,6,801,4.569444444444445
4255939,5,B0043K8LW2,"(I originally wrote this review for Chicago's DAILY HERALD Newspaper, October 29, 2010.)

""How can he be working for the devil and God at the same time?"" asks Jenny McCarthy, Playboy Playmate of the Year 1994, author, and television personality.

She's referring, of course, to Hugh M. Hefner, the subject of the fascinating new documentary, ""Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel.""

For over 50 years, Hefner, and the iconic men's magazine he founded in 1953 have never escaped controversy and criticism. The film, written and directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Brigitte Berman, explores the humanitarian side of the man who some label a ""pornographer.""

""Humanitarian?"" you ask.

Would it surprise you to know that in 1971, ACLU of Southern California named Hefner ""Man of the Year""? In 1974, Hefner was honored for his ""profound influence on legislative and judicial thought"" by the San Francisco Criminal Bar Association? And in 1977, he received a Special Humanitarian Award from the Beverly Hills-Hollywood Chapter of the NAACP?  And that his daughter Christie, who served as CEO of Playboy Enterprises between 1982-2008, established in 1979 the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award to individuals who have made a significant contribution to the protection and enhancement of the rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution?

And how about the time when Hefner utilized his private jet, the ""Big Bunny,"" to transport a number of Vietnamese orphans around the country to deliver them to new homes? Or how he fought for racial equality in entertainment venues, breaking the color barrier for the first time so that blacks and whites could perform together on stage and on television? Or how he broke the blacklist by publishing writers who were victims of the McCarthy-era?

Would you believe that Hefner and his company have provided legal defense funds for Americans involved in freedom of speech cases, women's rights issues, sexual freedom and gay rights arguments, and minor drug offences?
But Berman doesn't sugarcoat the proceedings. Also appearing in the film are several of Hefner's long-standing opponents, such as feminist author Susan Brownmiller, who calls Hefner ""dangerous,"" Christian activist and singer Pat Boone, and Mike Wallace, who, back in the 50s, told Hefner that in 5 years the publisher would be ""doing something else.""

Using archival footage and material pulled from Hefner's vast private collection, much of which has never been seen before, Berman tells both sides of Hef's battles with the religious right, state and local governments, the FBI, and even foes as powerful as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. It's eye-opening stuff.

Most importantly, the picture is entertaining. It moves along at a brisk pace as one aspect of Hefner's life is revealed after another. A number of celebrities, authors, and politicians chime in with opinions. If you're looking for titillation, however, you won't find it here. There is plenty of nudity, in the form of photographs taken from the magazine, but there is nothing salacious or scandalous.",1290988800,22,3071,5.274590163934426

8415133,5,B0043K8LW2,I saw this documentary on TV and had to buy the DVD.  The story of how he built his empire is quite inspiring.  It was interesting to hear that he saw Playboy as competing with Esquire and that he was thrilled when Playboy's circulation eclipsed theirs.  The interviews with other people on what they think of Playboy--good and bad are very interesting.,1391299200,,353,4.661290322580645
8415134,5,B0043K8LW2,"This Documentary is very in depth. It has a slow pace but mainly because this is about Hugh Hefner the man, Not the just the ""Playboy"" Side of Him. This piece is not flashy. It is great autobiography showing the deeper side to Hef. Recommended if you want to learn more about Hugh Hefner's world. Great for any playboy collector.",1389916800,,329,4.5

8415136,5,B0043K8LW2,There were many things I did not know about this man. He's an American treasure. It's  a great documentary and a piece of American history. There should be  a college course on this man.,1369872000,,186,4.4411764705882355
8415137,4,B0043K8LW2,"Excellent documentary of Hef's life and fame, what motivated him and what led to his success. This doesn't handle everything with kid gloves as even a lot of controversial topics are presented (feminist attacks, death of Dorothy Stratten, etc.). And even Hef's detractors are interviewed and offer their opinions on him and his life's work.

Good documentary and well-needed.",1369008000,,375,5.3559322033898304

He has helped to steal the innocence of many and thousands upon thousands of young women,all for his sleazy pleasure. This man is without a doubt,one of the most vile men ever to walk this earth. I pray,that he opens his eyes and repents of his sins before it's too late.",1355616000,,384,4.422535211267606
