4257807,3,B000NW7DHI,"I bought & watched this movie mainly because i enjoy the acting of Randolph Scott as a western actor he was one the best but the D.V.D itself the quality & sound is very poor. lot of disortion.
Even though it tells you on the case that some quality has been lost  during the transfer process I was disapointed overall.
If by chance a better quality D.V.D was ever re-produced i am sure that western fans would look at paying for a better quality movie.",1375574400,2,452,4.317647058823529

4257809,3,B000NW7DHI,"After the utterly diasatrous Elstree Hill release, and me being a bit stubborn, I thought I would try this Desert Island films DVD, thinking it couldn't be worse, quality wise. Well dear reader, it isn't worse, but it ain't good. Very washed out colour, and not great sound. It is watchable however, and if I give the Elstree Hill release 1 out of 10 I would give this 6 out of 10. Hope this makes sense. (I still think for the fact it's poor quality that it is too expensive). (Oh and the film is of course very good. Can some company manage a restored/good quality print...please!!)

4257810,3,B000NW7DHI,Curious little western that tells what happened at Fort Lincoln a few days after Little Big Horn massacre (note the Lewisesque circular travelling of the inside of Fort Lincoln as Randolph Scott makes his appearance). Equally amazing is the role given to horses in 7th Cavalry. Recommended to Joseph H. Lewis completists or horsemeat amateurs.,1326240000,,343,5.254545454545455

4257812,1,B000NW7DHI,"I ordered this product from Amazon UK -- the video quality is terrible, much worse than a VHS. The picture looks as if it has been dubbed from a poor master. Poor clarity, badly faded colors, and a constant hissing sound in the audio. There's even a warning on the case saying the 'some image quality may have been lost' when the video was mastered.",1284163200,11,349,4.384615384615385
4257813,4,B000NW7DHI,"Columbia Pictures presents ""7TH CAVALRY"" (1956) (75 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring Randolph Scott, Barbara Hale, Jay C. Flippen, Frank Faylen & Leo Gordon. --- Directed by Joseph H. Lewis and released in April 1, 1951, our story line and film, Returning to Fort Lincoln, Captain Benson learns of Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn. At the inquiry as Custer's Officers blame Custer for the defeat, Benson tries to defend him. But Benson was suspiciously absent at the time of the battle and is now despised by the troops. So when an order to retrieve the bodies from the battlefield arrives, Benson volunteers for the dangerous mission of returning back into Indian territory --- Although it's nowhere near as good as the oaters Scott did with Budd Boetticher, this one nonetheless still rises above most of the other westerns from Harry Cohn, Columbia Pictures and company was putting out ... It also helps filming it out in the California pine country away from the usual Columbia ranch locations that we've seen many times before --- And Mr. Scott was secure enough in his stardom that he gave good lines and depth to the younger actors in the film.

Lewis  (Director), Harry Joe Brown  (Producer), Peter Packer  (Screenwriter), Glendon Swarthout  (Short Story Author), Ray Rennahan  (Cinematographer), Mischa Bakaleinikoff  (Composer (Music Score), Gene Havlick  (Editor),George Brooks  (Art Director) - - - - the cast includes Randolph Scott  (Capt.

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959), ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

4257817,1,B000NW7DHI,I was very disappointed in this movie. I only spent 5 minutes looking at it because the quality was so poor. Don't waste your money on this one.,1406505600,,144,4.178571428571429
4257818,4,B000NW7DHI,"The copy I viewed had great cinematography for its period of production. Acting quality also was fine, for its time, even great.

However, if directing includes such things as stage set, scenery, realism in terms of reproduction of Fort Lincoln, this was an especially poorly directed production.

Snow-capped mountain peaks just simply do not exist in the area of Fort Lincoln. Hilltops, yes, but mountain tops no. Neither are there any of the evergreen forest. Further, the structures now standing, that are rebuilt to be replicas of the original structure, were not of log cabin construction, I could go on and on but to no purpose.

My point is that 7th Cavalry is fine for entertainment but don't regard it as historical. For it definitely is not.so far a departure that I could not discard my disbelief, despite my normal fascination with Randolph Scott as an actor.

Boots & Saddles, on the other hand, is much closer to the truth, at least Libby Custer's truth,  than is 7th Cavalry.",1404518400,,991,4.840236686390533

Captain Benson returns with his bride to Fort Lincoln. He notices something wrong from a distance. It is too quiet. What happened? A woman accuses him of absence. All those men who rode with Custer are dead, along with her husband Captain James Reynolds. He finds men drunk in the stables. They are ordered to duty. The flag is lowered to half-staff. The surviving troops return. The Sioux had Winchester 73 repeating rifles and lots of ammunition. Why did it happen? One man blames Custer. Captain Benson wasn't from West Point, he had been a river boat gambler. He was recruited by Custer as a scout. Colonel Kellogg will hold a court of inquiry. Should others have been there with Custer? Col. Kellogg with inquire into the disaster. Major Reno explains his orders to save his troops. Captain Benteen explains his actions. Are they trying to blame a dead man who cant defend himself?

Colonel Kellogg speaks to his daughter about Captain Benson. She hopes to marry Tom. Captain Benson testifies about his abstention. The President orders a burial detail. Benson asks for volunteers, some don't know this. They are watched as they move to the battlefield. Benson chases one Indian, they fight. [This provides action.] The troop continues to the battlefield in spite of warnings. Benson has another fight with a trooper. [More action.] Some troopers talk about a murder; it fails. One corporal was a witness to Custers order to Benson. The troop arrives at the battlefield. Officers are placed in coffins, the others buried in place. [They were later re-buried.] Many Indians arrive. I come in peace. One Sioux brave explains their customs and beliefs. There is dissension among the troopers. Will there be another battle? The appearance of Custers horse is like an omen. The troopers mount and ride off and return to the fort. Colonel praises Captain Benson for his actions.

Custer and two other captains were promoted to Brigadier General (brevet) in June 1863. Custer helped to win the Battle of Gettysburg in July by defeating JEB Stuarts Invincibles. Custer won every battle he was in except his last one. He was considered a hero by Americans. In the 1950s there began a propaganda campaign to discredit him. You can see earlier movies how he was regarded. They Died With Their Boots On is still the best Hollywood movie. Custer was promoted to General at age 23, a record that stands today. He died at age 36, barely middle-aged. Robert M. Utleys book can educate you; there are others. Was he a vainglorious fool or a victim of President Grants Indian policy of taking Indian lands for railroads and homesteaders? It is a political question. Custer and his wife Libby are buried at West Point.

This movie has some educational parts, but is not as good as TDWTBO. It shows the Indians on horses without stirrups, historically correct. Did all the Indians have repeating rifles against the single-shot carbines of the Cavalry? You can learn more by reading a good history book than a Hollywood movie.",1485734400,,3033,4.872093023255814
