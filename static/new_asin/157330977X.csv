7798189,1,157330977X,"I agree with the other review that the 3 disc set ""The Best of Beavis and Butthead"" was complete trash!  It wasn't funny,....it was cutting room floor material that was a complete waste of money.  Troubled Youth, Feel Our Pain, Innocence Lost, Chicks N Stuff, Butt O Ween, and Beavis and Butthead Do Christmas were the names that stunk up my dvd player only twice.  I couldn't bear to watch them again because they were so pathetically worthless.",1150761600,,446,4.6923076923076925
7798190,5,157330977X,"Another worthy Beavis and Butthead Volume. I think some of these episdoes should have been on work sucks but that was the duo's first volume. I enjoyed ""Work is Death"", Just seeing Beavis getting the crap beat out of him makes me laugh for hours.""No Service"" is sort of like the 2nd ""Customers Suck"" but still worthy for my entertainment. This is a cool volume. Beavis and Butthead Rule!!!",1100908800,,389,4.6521739130434785
7798191,1,157330977X,"I am a *HUGE* Beavis and Butt-Head fan.  Needless to say I saw the ads on TV and had to order the 3-disk collection called ""Best of Beavis and Butt-head"".  I was (and still am) greately disappointed.
The collection consists of 3-disks, each with two groups of episodes.  The resultant six groups are also sold seperately as:
- Troubled youth
- Fell our pain
- Innocence lost
- Chicks n' stuff
- Butt-o-ween
- Beavis and Butt-head do Christmas.
Whoever tossed-together this collection didn't select the ""best"" episodes.  They selected probably the worst.  I don't even remember most of the episodes that appear in this collection.  I seem to recall plenty of stomach-busting B&BH episodes, but for some reason they don't appear anywhere in this collection.
The collection does not include any episode(s) with ""fire! fire!"".  How can you have a Beavis and Butt-head collection without the words ""fire! fire!""??? Don't waste your money on this garbage.  Also missing is frog baseball.
Hopefully, way back when they were on MTV you taped the truly ""best"" episodes - 'cause they ain't in this collection.  I can't say enough bad about this collection.  True Beavis and Butt-head fans will be woefully disappointed.",1055894400,3,1209,5.0
7798192,5,157330977X,all episodes on this collection get an A+. Imagine if Beavis and Butt-Head were still on. The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt-Head on TV once again. One can only imagine.,1055635200,,167,4.6
7798193,5,157330977X,"Citizen's Arrest(A-)- Good opening ep.  Here the b's make a citizen's arrest and attempt to do it again.  Hilite when the b's try to arrest a police officer.
Substitute(B+)-  Not A material, but still enjoyable.  Here the b's injure their substitute while their real teacher's injuries get worse.  Hilite when the blackboard falls on Van Driessen.
No Service(A)-  Improvement over the first two.  Here Butthead harasses Beavis on the job on a busy day at Burger World.  Hilite when Butthead orders food not on the menu.
Impotence(B)- Weakest ep on the tape.  Here the b's go to an impotence center in hopes of scoring.  Hilite when the b's arousement levels are really high.
Speech Therapy(A-)- Back into the A material.  Here the b's are sent to a speech therapy class.  Hilite when the b's find vulgarity in their teachers' exercises.
Work is Death(A)- The improvement keeps on going.  Here the b's try to get worker's compensation.  Hilite when the b's boss injures himself.
Die Fly Die(A+)- Best ep on the tape.  Here the b's destroy their house trying to get rid of a fly.  Hilite when Beavis takes a dump on the floor to lure the fly.
Tainted Meat(A)- Good finale.  Here Beavis' weiner scratching on the job causes people to get sick.  Hilite when Butthead tells Beavis to put his penis away on the drive thru speaker.
All n all I give this tape an A",1052611200,2,1356,4.649789029535865
7798194,4,157330977X,"As always, anyone who watched MTV in the 90s knows that Beavis and Butthead were a phenomena that has turned into a cult status today.  The VHS version here helps commemorate that.
This video has a few of the episodes from the MTV show, and as always they're fun to watch. The only bad thing about this is there's only a couple.  By the time you really get into the video and want to see more, it ends.  It's pretty much MTV taking advantage of the whole marketing thing by only having a few episodes per tape, but because the price has lowered to [price] it's not a bad deal.  You do have to get the others to really have a sit-down Beavis and Butthead festival and they're pretty good in combo.  They aren't released on DVD and none of the controversial ""Fire!"" ones are there -- mostly because they were sued over that whole incident.
Go ahead and get them -- they're fun.  For more of the episodes, you have to find them through downloadable engines (in poorer copies, I add) and if you're looking for Liquid Television as well, they are available on VHS and DVD -- check it out.  All in all, good, but not quite enough for one tape.  Price, however, can't be beat.",1012176000,6,1169,4.330275229357798
