6362066,5,B00JJRLG7G,Im so happy this is fianly getting a release here. Now if we can just get Mrs. Browns boys we will be doing good :-),1404000000,2,116,3.68
6362067,5,B00JJRLG7G,"It's British humour..which a lot of Americans just don't get.
It's about an openly gay couple...which a lot of people may have issues with.
It's supposed to be over the top...watch the interview with McKellen and Jacobi and hear their take on the characters.
Enjoy it...it's a comedy not a documentary.",1403827200,15,302,4.9411764705882355
6362068,5,B00JJRLG7G,"First, I love the series. Older gay couple who have been together since the Gay 70's! GOOD NEWS! THIS REGION 1 2-DISK SET INCLUDES THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!  It has ALL 7 episodes of season 1. I verified this at the shoppbs.org if you want to check for yourself.  PBS has a full episode list on it.  Buy it and Enjoy!  I have seen some negative reviews saying it is too campy!  It IS the gay Odd Couple.  Love it or leave it!  I had a chance to see it on an imported Region 2 disk from the UK.  No, the Region 2 disk will not play on a standard  US or Canadian DVD player, you need a multi region player and a TV that can handle the different frame rate of video.  Search DVD Regions on the net for the DVD Region details. Sadly, the Region 2 SINGLE disk doesn't have the Christmas special only the six regular episodes because the special had not aired in the UK when the single disk was released.  Happy Pride!",1402012800,44,909,4.107954545454546
6362069,5,B00JJRLG7G,"I haven't laughed this hard at a TV show in such a long time! This British comedy is in the same vein (sharp, witty, sarcastic) as Absolutely Fabulous. A duo (gay couple) are in a 49 year relationship and one thing that keeps them together is bantering back and forth with witty, sometimes vicious sarcasm...which some old 'queens' are known for. The supporting cast really adds flavor to the superb leading men on this show. If you are open minded enough to enjoy a show with a gay couple as leading characters, you will love this show! If you have issues with gay people, well, I would suggest you just move along.

For some people the sarcasm will be too much, but if you know any gay people, you then know that 'sharp, witty and sarcastic' comments are as gay as a rainbow flag.",1399766400,167,782,4.430555555555555
6362100,5,B00JJRLG7G,This is a hilarious show. I love the dog gag.,1522454400,,45,3.6
6362101,5,B00JJRLG7G,I knew I loved it during the first episode when I actually LOLed which is rare for sitcoms these days. Very British humor but the accents aren't hard to understand which is the case with many of the shows coming from the UK. I wish more seasons were produced.,1522195200,,259,4.3061224489795915
6362102,5,B00JJRLG7G,"So funny -- I do love British actors -- and these are the best . The timing is exquisite.  It is very theatrical, from the set to the extravagant performances.  I can understand why many don't care for it (especially Americans) but I think it's brilliant.  It is also an homage to television of the 70s, both American (think All in the Family) and British, but still very, very original and well done.  I laugh out loud at least 10 times a show (poor Balthazer) and how often does that happen?",1518652800,,493,4.384615384615385

6362108,5,B00JJRLG7G,"I am LOVING this! Beautiful acting (how can one go wrong with this cast)? Hillarious and deliciously cringeworthy at times. British TV comedy at its absolute best!

Freakishly funny in way that is genius. You should feel like a bad person after watching this...but you don't. You just laugh.",1514505600,,293,5.23404255319149
6362140,5,B00JJRLG7G,Excellent! And bears up well to repeated viewings. I hope this never leaves Amazon Prime.,1514332800,,89,5.0
6362141,2,B00JJRLG7G,"Too one note, after a few episodes series is predictable.  Lack of nuance and acting plays too deeply into stereotypes. They behave so cluelessly.  Believe a good series needs to contain one character who has a grip on reality-- the characters self absorbed.  If I want self absorption I only need to step out into the world.  Insults flying does not make a good series.",1513814400,,370,4.6461538461538465
6362142,3,B00JJRLG7G,"It's weird seeing Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) playing a comedic role after watching him in 5 seasons of Game of Thrones. He's way better in GOT, by the way. Good actors, okay script. All in all, there are better British comedies.",1513728000,,228,4.585365853658536

6362146,5,B00JJRLG7G,My only disappointment is that there won't be more shows than the 2 seasons and the series finale.  It fast became one of my favorite BBC productions.,1510963200,,150,4.555555555555555
6362147,5,B00JJRLG7G,"I suppose this could have been better, especially with the writing of Mason's character, but this is a breath of fresh air for us over-60's (OK, I'm not quite there but my siblings are).

I mean: the greats, Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen? Such fun to see them playing comedy!  And then de la Tour and Rheon - great additions.

Yes, there is a lot of cliche. Yes, I wouldn't want my children under 14 to watch it yet, and/but not because the leads are gay. Not happy w/ the stabbing of the broom handle of the near-dead dog, but it's a form of humor so I ignore.

But this is a refreshing series and wish there were more episodes; Brits do great stuff but they don't pay their actors enough!",1510876800,2,690,4.244274809160306

6362172,5,B00JJRLG7G,Wish the series did not end.  The only downside (no fault of the seller) is there is no play all option in the main menu.  After each episode plays the dvd reverts back to the main menu to choose play again.,1505865600,,207,4.024390243902439

6362178,5,B00JJRLG7G,"This is an awesome comedy staring our favorite magic man from Harry Potter Ian McKellen. Funny, sarcastic, and unrealistic portrayal of two elderly male lovers.

6362229,5,B00JJRLG7G,"Incredibly funny! Whimsical insults throughout, yet after 48 years of being together the two main characters are never able to truly leave each other. It's a love that is comfortable in its 'viciousness'. The acting is well done. Sir McKellen is glorious as an over-the-top actor, Freddie, who can barely make it in the biz and has to settle for bit parts. Sir Jacobi is brilliant as the flamboyant stay-at-home partner, Stuart, who can go toe-to-toe with Freddie. The arguments are numerous, the insults also, but it's NORMAL for them. The young straight man, Ash, is also very convincing and at times has tears in his eyes if you look close enough. His comedic timing is brilliant when dealing with the sex-starved Violet who is about 35-40 years his senior. The actress who plays her, please forgive I cannot remember her name, but she played in the Goblet of Fire as Hagrid's crush-interest, is SPLENDID as Violet. Her expressions when having no lines are the sign of a truly trained actress and I enjoy watching her as much as Freddie and Stuart. My other favorite is the character Penelope. Dementia is setting in for this character and the actress portrays her so beautifully. Seriously... consider watching this show. You will not be disappointed. Season 3 finale' is a mere one-shot episode to bring the story to a final closure, and it's not one of my favorites as the ending left me sobbing (Not in a bad way. You'll understand if you watch it. No one dies, that much I'll tell you, but it is a tad heartbreaking. Beautifully done, but heartbreaking.) With that being said, grab 'Vicious' for yourself and enjoy the hilarity! Soooo worth it!",1483401600,,1652,4.77972027972028

6362486,5,B00JJRLG7G,"Some, who are accustomed to American sitcoms, might find this less engaging than I do, but as a big buff of the English theatre scene, I find this program excellent. We have two stars of the English stage in half-hour episodes that seem like a televised image of a stage production. It is well written and brilliantly acted. The two protagonists are like any couple who have lived together for 40 years: they often get on each other's nerves and are constantly trading barbs, if not to pass the time, but then to distract from the awareness that they are completely dependent on each other. It is funny and endearing at the same time.",1467417600,,634,4.5701754385964914

This series is hilarious. Its centered around to aging queens in a very long relationship. Their banter is clever and funny. Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen were born for these roles (but then again Ian McKellen is genius in every role he portrays). The supporting characters are equally as witty. I love Iwan Rhoen (Misfits). This ranks right up there with British comedy classics such as Fawlty Towers, Absolutely Fabulous, Are You Being Served and Keeping Up Appearances.

I also grew up in Boystown and thought a series with two gay characters would be great fun, especially portrayed by two of the finest actors alive today...sadly, nothing they could do could rescue this misguided and sorely disappointing farce. The writing has moments, but the actors are so over the top they make Harvey Fierstein look like Stephen Wright. It's one thing to play an obviously gay character with flair, a la Sean Hayes on Will and Grace but this extreme exaggeration reads more like what people in Texas imagine gay men to be like, in a not-so-flattering or respectful way. Flaming queens swanning about, fanning themselves and plotzing over men young enough to be their grandsons...hilarious, right? Sadly, this should COULD be hilarious because the elements are all there, but because of the bizarre choice to do this like drag queens on crack, it was just god-awful. I am baffled by the rave reviews, I feel certain that John Waters could watch this and say, ""it's a bit much, fellas.""",1464566400,3,1224,4.751173708920188

Classically dry British humor, modernized for current culture and subject material, at it's absolute best !

6363023,2,B00JJRLG7G,"This isn't the worst sitcom I've ever seen (especially on the British side of things) but I expected so much more from a scenario like this and that is a big disapointment.

Ian McKellan and Derek Jarobi give great performances as these washed-up actors who don't care for people or even each other, but that's the only good thing I can say about the series.
The stories are forgettable, the side characters are not written as funny as the two leads (even they have a few hiccups along the way) and this scenario with two horrible people I feel was not only been done before, but SO much better.

For example: Bottom with Rik Mayall and Adrain Edmonson's characters and their situations. While extremely over-the-top and vile in their actions, you at least feel for these guys, relate to their constant strings of bad luck and poor choices, and even feel sorry at times. You really liked those characters because there's a small part of you that wants them to prevail and get what they want, even when it's a million times funnier when they don't.

Vicious doesn't do that for me. I watched the full first season expecting something other than the two leads being awesome, but got nothing. Even if people say that the second season is superior for one reason or more, I would still have no interest in viewing it. Just rent a copy of Cuckoo or Stella or Misfits or something instead. They would at least have SOMETHING other than NOTHING.",1460678400,,1438,4.609375
6363024,3,B00JJRLG7G,"This would have been a far better effort if (a) they hadn't insisted on including the tired old laugh track, which is only used when the producers feel the audience will be too dim-witted to catch the jokes otherwise, and (b) if they had played it in a less painfully camp style. McKellen does a creditable job of trying to rescue the production but Jacobi seems to think that heavy-handed one-dimensional camp is enough to serve up.

If this had been more The Dresser and less Are You Being Served it would have been both funnier and more touching. As it is, one can only regret the waste of two talented actors on a mediocre script and even less inspired direction.",1460419200,,667,4.512396694214876

6363087,4,B00JJRLG7G,"Two of my favorite actors, playing off each other with great skill, and I think having good fun into the bargain.  The only reason for not giving it the fifth star (although I debated about it) is that once in a while the insults being thrown around go a little to far to suit me. At some points they make me wince.  That won't make me stop watching, though, as the rest of the show is very funny, and the occasional (brief) sweet moment is very much worth it.
Outside of the main two, the character of Ash is a treat, also, as he never quite knows how to take those old guys.

The two main stars, McKellan and Jacobi, bicker and abuse each other just like any longtime marrieds. They have settled into a comfortable retirement that seems to entirely consist of trading barbs, but you do get the feeling that underneath their calloused exteriors the two men really do care for each other. The supporting cast lends a few zingers, too. Well recommended.",1457222400,,525,4.9772727272727275

Both Jacobi and McKellen are over the top, but exhibit the proper restraint in their roles as a couple who have been together for 48 years. The supporting cast are excellent. Performances from supporting cast members Frances de la Tour and Marcia Warren are equal to the main characters. The biggest surprise is Iwan Rheon who plays a straight young man who moves into a flat below Jacobi and McKellens' place. Many will know Rheon as the extremely sadistic Ramsay Bolton from Game of Thrones. His performance in Vicious is a completely different one than his Ramsay Bolton role and it reminds me often of how talented British actors are. Every episode is solidly funny and will leave you gasping for air or aching from laughing to hard.

Sadly, the writing is more suited to ""Are You Being Served"" (and the jokes are just as old) and doesn't take advantage of their skills.

6363597,5,B00JJRLG7G,"Vicious is my guilty pleasure - in the very best trainwreck sense.  I loved Ian McKellan and Derek Jacobi long before I saw this show, but Vicious gives them a chance to do comedy (gasp!), and they do it quite well.  The ensemble cast is remarkable, Frances de la Tour is a treasure, and Marcia Warren steals every scene she's in. Probably everyone knows a Freddie-and-Stuart - a couple who have been together for ages who have a (ahem) unique system of communication that unnerves their friends, but who also have a boundless affection for each other.  Iwan Rheon does an amazing job of playing the young, not-very-deep-but-stand-up neighbor.  The only time in three seasons that I've seen his GOT menace is when his character does some behind-the-scenes protection of Freddie and Stuart by getting rid of a predatory gym trainer. As laugh-out-loud funny as Vicious is, it's also touching, poignant, and genuine.  A must watch.",1445904000,,928,4.923076923076923

I find this series very funny and extremely well acted, but I think I would not like meeting either of these two characters in real life.

I was shocked and appalled. Especially at Sir McKellen. After all the wonderful work he has done in support of the gay community. I almost had myself half way convinced that I should watch a second episode. But I just couldn't.

6363681,1,B00JJRLG7G,"I really wanted to like this, as I love both of these actors, but this just doesn't work for me.  It's campy and stagey and over the top, and the laugh track is intrusive.  My husband and I discussed it- and under the brutal laugh track, there's actually some decent writing, but it gets lost in the overacting and the over laughing.  Gay people don't need to be portrayed this way, to be endearing, charming and funny.  They're funny without overdoing it.  The gay stereotypes are turned up about 3 notches too high.  It's not like we don't know any queens- we live near San Francisco- but I've never seen anyone that acted like this.  I guess if you just want to laugh at gay situations, this might be for you- but I'd like more nuance, and less flamboyant stereotyping.  If it had just been toned down a little, and sold without the horrendous laugh track, I think I would have liked it.  Some of the lines were adorable- but were delivered so badly, it was hard to appreciate them.",1445126400,7,985,4.427777777777778

6363708,5,B00JJRLG7G,"This is not just a very funny, quick witted and fast paced sitcom,...it is cast with some of the true greats,Sir Ian McKellen,Dereck Jacobi and France's de la Tour!...And a relative newcomer Iwan Rheon,who makes us cringe Sunday's during the seasonal run of  Game of Thrones playing the evil Ramsay!!!...that should be enough right there to get people to at the very least check this out!

When you do..what you will find is Sir Ian and Dereck Jacobi playing quick witted,sharp tongued ""old queens"" left over from the era when gay men camped it up as a matter of course...They both make it natural,but this is high camp!

The two have been spouces for over 30 years and lets just say that their relationship not only withstands,but depends on a slew of ""viscious"" barbs thrown back and forth to endure not only the aging process,but the regrets and mishaps of their long life together.  France's de la Tour is their old neurotic friend who is ever present,much to their dismay,but they wouldn't have it any other way of course..

Enter Ramsay!  I mean a 20 year old handsome boy/man that all three of our older stars fawn over..he is taking the flat upstairs,much to their delight,regardless of the fact that he is str8,way too young for any of them,with  girl problems and in need of advice and mentorship.

This is the setting for this happy,romp through innuendo and one liners and past celebrations and miseries,moved in with the day to day antics of and very odd foursome trying to get thru another day in London.  oh and BTW..THIS IS VERY BRITISH!  And very entertaining and not to be missed.  It was co created by the same who brought us ""Will and Grace""...now you know the type of humor I'm talking about...but with acid!

So,we have two of the most polished and famous and respected trained Shakespere actors in all of Britain camping it up on stage in a cross between the comedy of Will and Grace and Married with Children,..do you really want to miss this one?...I didn't think so...",1444867200,,1994,4.6657142857142855

And the acting from the supporting cast is terrific as well.
But for every hilarious moment,  another joke is awkwardly painful or falls flat. Some jokes are really funny.  Other jokes are too cruel to enjoy.
But making up for it's shortcomings,  there are a LOT of sincere touching moments.

The actors seem like they are enjoying themselves and with each insult we fall more and more in love with them. It's very well written and even though it goes through the typical comedy shenanigans you might see on a sitcom it somehow manages to upended them at the same time. There is also something particularly galvanizing about listening to a cast over 70 swearing and caring on as if they are real people and not just caricatures of themselves.

As an added bonus we do get to see Ramsay Bolton make a lot of jokes at his expense.",1443225600,,649,4.453781512605042

It is more of a play than a sitcom since almost everything happens in one room. But, we do get to see the kitchen when someone checks to see if Balthazar is still breathing.

Outstanding !  The writing an dialogue is great and now I truly am understanding the title of series...the guys are vicious but underneath all of the intelligent , perfectly crafted sarcasm...glimmers of love and dedication do come through.
I will US comedy's could write this smartly, but guess it will never happen. The language standards are different on the BBC than here and the occasional swear does actually make it much funnier than a sanitized  replacement word.  Great series, and the 4 stars continue to do an amazing job as the dialogue never gets tired as they find new ways to craft insults. Highly recommend.",1442707200,,790,4.7101449275362315

These gentlemen are a hilarious older couple who constantly exchange mean snarky comments with each other & their friends, in a truly dry British fashion. You'll notice they're a gay couple. But that seems to make their snarkiness even funnier (they remind me of the Bundys arguing on ""married with children"" - but a lot classier).
Everyone on this ensemble show is talented & bizarrely co-dependent.

Makes me want to see ""I, Claudius"" again.  If you love Ian McKellan and Derek Jacobi's work, you'll love this change of pace.  It's a riot.

I love the supporting cast, too.  All do a great job, and it's well worth your time, if you need a good laugh.  It's wicked good.  Brilliant!  Cannot WAIT for the next season!  It's only a 1/2 hour show, so it goes by too fast.  You'll love the character work.  Truly VICIOUS, and very campy.  A hoot!",1440633600,2,741,4.6875

Jacobi and McKellen are lovers who have been together 48 years when the series starts.

Add Iwan Rheon as the new neighbor, Ash, whom the boys think should be gay but isn't.... fun times.

It is so funny in places that the actors have a hard time keeping a straight face. Note: this is British comedy so they are allowed to swear on TV.  Ian McKellan is excellent in everything he does. The character of Ash is a cute one, a far cry from the actor's performances in Game of Thrones.  Derek Jacobi is a bit too 'queenly' in places but he does get some good zingers in.

The show is hilarious; it's laugh out loud funny. The cast work great together. It mixes actors from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, which is hard not to love. I think the elderly three do the best. The actor who plays Ash is a good actor. He is great in Misfits and in Game of Thrones, but I think he isn't as skilled in the sitcom setting. While the others perform masterfully, he plays Ash poorly. It doesn't feel genuine.

There is a lot of truth about being with someone this long. I have been married since 1969 and it is not that different for straight couples, the sniping stage. Part of it is that you've both just gotten old.

One aspect to this show is that both gay men are written so as to fit within just about every gay stereotype ever made. There are gay men who are not like this and I wonder if some of them might find this show a bit much for that reason. These two are so flamboyantly gay that they could mount their own Gay Pride parade.

Much as I can relate to that relationship aspect of it, I could have used something more in the show. I did like their straight young neighbor. He made a good foil for them. And, of course, Derek Jacobi and Ian McKlellan are both excellent actors. I did not like the laugh track used on this show at all. They should have shot it in front of a live audience.

For most of my life,  Ive wished for a series about Gay people that is of the high quality that Vicious is and Episode six (6) is a prime example of that high quality.

In the series, Ian Mckellen greatly plays partner Freddie who is very rough  and full of himself on the outside but caring very deeply about his partner of forty-nine (49)years, Stuart as wonderfully played by Derek Jacobi.  Ian and Derek are the stars of the series giving very humorous performancessuch GREAT actors! They are joined by Frances de la Tour (one of my favorites) who is hysterical as sex crazed Violet, the partners closest friend.

Episode six (6) is certainly a very fine sample of how great and very funny this series is.  This episode revolves around Stuart finally after forty-nine years coming out to his mom.  It has Dame Judy Dench leaving a very funny phone messageloved it!

6364995,4,B00JJRLG7G,"I really, really like this series! I read some mixed reviews about it initially in which it was criticized for being over the top.. yes it is but that's also what makes it work. The characters are eccentric but it's precisely those eccentricities that make you love them and want to watch again and again. I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because it would be nice to see more evidence of why Freddie and Steward love one another. There are times when their jabs (mainly from Freddie) cut so deeply that I wonder why Steward stays with him (there's a line become sarcasm and emotional abuse).

The friends are simply insane and I love them for that! There are times I wish I could be Ash just to take part in a small way in their crazy moments. It's always worth nothing that any fan of Game of Thrones should watch this series simply because Iwan Rheon is amazing! He creeps the heck out of me on GoT but he's completely different here and he deserves recognition for his ability to play such a completely different characters/style of actings.

Just watch it! It's fun, it's crazy, it's one of the best comedies about life, friendship, and growing old.",1425686400,,1156,4.5

I would imagine that without it the writing would have been better, more clever.  But, that's the way it is.  Lots of questions arise, most following the obvious:  Why would two people as miserable as these aged queens, and who have such a nasty repartee between them, keep on with it?  It's not like it's 1965 when being gay was still a crime in most locales and having a long term relationship was something of an acheivement (it still is, even for straight people, but still...).  The show seems to bank on the premise that if gay people play stereotypes it's okay, where having anyone else in the role would be offensive---sort of like having a show of black characters playing all the old roles and dropping racial epithets with every sentence.

The show has its humorous lines but I find it to be something of a car wreck, one looks hoping not to see anything too terrible, but one looks just the same.  And they're doing a second season.

If you'll watch anything gay (and perhaps buy every lavender or rainbow trinket you come across) this show is for you.  Otherwise I find the attraction to watching two miserable old men insult each other incomprehensible.",1424217600,5,1274,4.622222222222222

Also as a gay man and in a relationship of 28-years, I do get the humor and can relate to the characters.  That said I am a bit disappointed in the show's writing.  The character Stuart is too much alike Mr. Humphries in ""Are You Being Served?"" which is an iconic role so is a cheap knockoff. Even the telephone intro in nearly every episode gets old and is also a steal from the Humphries character. The plots are predictable and very staged at times.  They do need to diversify and the series was way too short for the first season!  I am hoping it will be a success after a mixed start because it is about time a show about older gay couples come to light.  The difference here from those portrayed in American sitcoms is the bantering humor and that is what makes it unique.  I am hoping Season 2 is much better so it will continue.",1418428800,,917,4.176136363636363

The first 2 episodes are a riot while the last 4 we, as well as the writers it seems, settle into what is the norm to explore further into what makes them who they are . . . I have to say it is a disappointment the Christmas Special isn't part of the purchase of the videos as it is on the DVD, as it was seeing this episode that brought me in, and I brought 5 others in after with each new person being part of the groups prior.

6365092,5,B00JJRLG7G,"One of the funniest comedies to come down the path in many years.  Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellan are priceless as a gay couple nearing their 50th anniversary together.  The jibes, put-downs, and just general bitchiness that these two fire at one another belie the undying love and devotion they have one for the other.  In the hands of lesser actors, the characters wouldn't come off as lovable and hilarious as these fellows.  With a solid supporting cast behind them, Vicious is well worth the expense of ownership.  If I could have given it more than five stars, I most surely would.",1416441600,,586,4.705882352941177

We had recorded it when it aired, but finally got the DVD version because the censorship rules in the USA ruin the shows; too many words are bleeped out for totally illogical reasons!",1416355200,,391,4.256756756756757

Ian and Derick are just so wonderful in there rolls makes you think that they have been a couple all along.
I am very happy to hear there is going to be a series two i can not wait till it is on dvd also.  Vicious is right and reminds me of some couples gay and straight that act that way.

I watched all episodes and then searched for Series II on both the UK and US amazon sites, but without any luck. It was a great series that ended much too abruptly as i would have enjoyed following the cast of four characters as they found themselves in further distressing circumstances. I particularly enjoyed Violet who was instantly recognized from Doc Martin ! She is a fabulous actress who added a great deal to the series. I laughed so hard that I couldn't speak when she made the call from Argentina in distress ! That could have been an excellent series all by itself.

These two brilliant actors lead a small but superb cast in a fast paced comedy about two gay men who have been together for forty-eight years. I was quite suprised that this superb comedy received mixed reviews in the UK. McKellan is Freddie, an actor who has passed his glory days, and Jacobi is Stuart. Iwan Rheon is Ashe, the young and very attractive neighbor who is straight but enjoys the company of Freddie and Stuart and their best friend Violet. Vicious is a marvelous comedy and I am so glad that there will be a second season. I do very much hope that Iwan Rheon remains in the cast as this young man is perfect as Ashe whose childhood has been anything but rosey. Vicious is hilarious!

Straights and gays alike will enjoy the cutting dialog these two actors portraying old ""queens"" as they go about their daily lives.  Older gays will recognize that how the stars act, was what really was said by many years ago.  The laughter never stops and everytime you think its calmed down, another argument between the 2 stars comes thru again.  Highly recommend this Season 1 of Vicious, and hope there will be a season 2.  Luckily, this Season 1 comes with the Christmas Show only in America, and I feel one of the best shows in the entire season.  Sit back and be prepared to laugh.",1411344000,,702,4.395348837209302

But the script is mostly really vicious, funny only if you are immune to hurt feelings and can laugh at pain. Everyone has a different sense of humor, and I have seen 'put-down' comedians that I thought were funny, such as Don Rickles. However, the love that is supposed to come out through the sarcastic comments doesn't seem genuine to me in this instance.

I wasn't all that impressed withThe first few episodes and I thought that the series might have been funnier if they were lifelong enemies instead of lovers. Then I played Disc 2. Claws an Fangs sharpened, they started in on each other and their two dinner guests. I haven't laughed so hard and for so long for years. The Christmas Episode was a scream. Derek Jacobi's Character's mother is mentioned throughout and she shows up in the Christmas Episode. I didn't  think they'd even be able to find an actress old enough to play this role. They did. The supporting cast is excellent. There's a ""straight"" friend in his twenties, an elderly Fag Hag Horn Dog and another Old Queen.

Its not the Homosexual aspect of this I like but the over the top Crotchety Old Fogy club and clash of generations. Im sure if they were an old married couple I would still get a belly laugh. About the only popular sitcom on PBS I do not care for is Keeping Up Appearances while the actress is wonderful in other parts the Bucket character just gets on my nerves. I got this because I thought the show was funny from the gut but the Language is censored by my local PBS and I wanted to hear all that was said.

But the premise is modern, two gay men with a partnership of forty eight years. We don't often see pieces with gay men ""of a certain age"", our culture is so youth driven. But these two actors, both gay men of a certain age in real life, really shine. The banter is razor sharp and in the hands of lesser skilled actors might not work, but here it does.

6365258,1,B00JJRLG7G,"When I first heard that these two Sirs were starring in a television comedy together I was ecstatic.  I knew they were both adept at comedy as I had seen Sir Derek in an episode of ""Frasier"" playing Jackson Hedley, the worst Shakespearean actor imaginable, and Sir Ian on ""Extras"" detailing how he is ""not really a wizard"".
  Regrettably the writing is juvenile, sophomoric, foolish, witless.  I hope I am not being coy here.  It smacks of grade school sniping of the following caliber of humor - ""What don't you like about me?""  ""Your face for starters"".  The British accents do not make up for the lack of humor here.  The episode in which Ash brings his girlfriend to see the two stars was especially egregious.  Comedy should be more than watching two elderly gentlemen behaving like grade school twits; it should be more than trading silly insults; it should be more than shameless mugging.  It is as though the writers overdosed on such fare as ""Three's Company,"" ""Bewitched,"" and ""Laverne and Shirley"" and decided to regurgitate it (that is, vomit it back up).  I hazard to guess that if these two fine actors were replaced by any two American actors the show would be seen for what it is - a parade of not-so-funny insults.  The humor here makes Neil Simon look like Chekov.
  I feel very badly for Sir Ian and Sir Derek (and the usually marvelous Francis La Tour) that they have to utter such vapid lines - I only hope that they are being well-compensated.  You know in ""Hamlet"" when the Danish prince confronts Gertrude and says ""What judgment would make you fly from this to this?"" (from Hamlet to Claudius)  I would ask the two stars what made them go from ""King Lear,"" ""Waiting for Godot,"" and ""No Man's Land"" to this???",1406764800,15,1733,4.596091205211726

So don't pay attention to the critics. This show is often laugh out loud funny. The humor is broad and pugnacious and frequently, well, vicious. I hate the latter in mean-girl type shows, but this is over-the-top fun. In episode 1, Violet jokes about rape in a way that didn't sit well with me, being a take-back-the-night person. After you get to know Violet better, you understand the joke better.

By the end of the seventh episode, I was fond of Freddie and Stuart, though Freddie would be horrified at the thought. Yes, Freddie, bombastic, vain and acid-tongued. He's played with much glee by Ian McKellan, whose mobile face is almost another actor -  it can carry a scene on its own.

Derek Jacobi's Stuart Bixby, one feels, is essentially nicer, and came by his barbed-tongue in self-defense, after 48 years with Freddie. Both of them, at least at home, use the hand gestures and exclamations that are stereotypical of Queens - that's the setting-back-gay-rights part. Except that after you watch this, you see Freddie Thornhill and Stuart Bixby as individuals. Who are gay. And that's the about-time-we-see-this-on-TV part.

""Vicious"" was filmed in front of a live audience, so it's real laughter that's obnoxious, not a laugh track. I figured it was filmed on stage because of the impeccable enunciation and delivery of the two stars. They were playing to an audience, with their rolled R's and rolled eyes. As a matter of fact, in a June 27, 2014 interview, McKellan told Morgan Jeffery:
"" 'It was particularly difficult for me to work out how to play to an audience of 500 people - who are in the studio with us - and play more subtly to the camera,' he said. 'I think there's a level of playing that I'm interested in getting right [this time].' McKellen also voiced his desire for there to be 'more signs of modern gay life' in the second series. 'I've heard hints that the characters are going to be getting out of the house a bit more, and I like that,' he said.""

This series 1 originally aired in England starting April 2013. Series 2 will be airing later in 2014. In the Series 1 DVD set, you get two discs with six regular episodes and one Christmas special, for 210 minutes of viewing fun. the DVD set has one Special Feature. English subtitles are available.

EDITED to add: Season 2 is now available!

Episode 1: As with every episode, it starts off with Stuart talking to his Mother on the phone (or a variation thereof). Stuart and Freddie meet Ash, the young man taking the vacant flat upstairs, and expend a lot of energy trying to figure out if he's gay. They hold a wake for their friend, Clive, and we get to meet the rest of the recurring cast, Violet, Penelope and Mason. After a particularly nasty comment to Stuart, Freddie confides to Violet, ""I never know when I've gone too far. But I'm always so glad when I do.""
Frances de la Tour plays the irrepressible Violet with a velvety seductive voice and half smile that always gives me the giggles.
Episode 2. Freddie is nervous. He's been invited to the Fan Club screening of the Dr. Who episode in which he appeared. ""Apparently, I have been voted the 10th most popular villain of all time."" He really needs a new dress coat for the event, but what's torturing him is that he thinks Stuart has found a younger man.
Episode 3. Ash helps Freddie prepare for his audition for a part in 'Downton Abby"". There's only one line, but one needs to fully understand the character before knowing how to deliver the line.
Episode 4. Stuart: ""I was thinking of going running today.""
Freddie: ""Good. Just so long as you keep going in the one direction.""
All this leads to a crisis for Stuart. As he tells Ash, ""It's not fair. I've always been the better-looking one. He's had his career. I've had my looks. And if I've lost them, I'm not sure who I am anymore.""
This has a lovely, sweet ending. But don't worry, there's plenty of comedy leading up to it, including Violet and her new depraved paramour in Argentina.
Episode 5. Ash brings his new girlfriend to dinner. It starts off great, but the best laid plans.....
Chloe: ""It's so inspiring that you've been together for so long. How do you do it?""
Freddie: ""Well, I mostly attribute it to the fact that he won't leave.""
Episode 6: Like every other episode, this one starts with a phone call from Stuart's Mother. This time, though, no one else is around, so Ash answers it, and innocently tells her, ""I suppose I'll be seeing you at the party tonight, Mrs. Bixby."" It's Stuart and Freddie's 49th anniversary party, and Stuart still hasn't told his Mother that he's gay. But never mind Stuart's Mother, Freddie expects a visit from Judi Dench. THE Judi Dench.
Episode 7 = Christmas Special. The boys host Christmas dinner with all their friends. Ash volunteers to do the cooking and Violet promises to bring her latest flame. How about a game of Truth or Dare?

DVD Special Feature, ""Interview With Cast and Crew"" (3 minutes) Commentators include Ian McKellan, Derek Jacobi, Frances de la Tour, Philip Voss (plays Mason), Marcia Warren (plays Penelope) and Iwan Rheon (plays Ash).  Frances says ""It's about time"" there was a show featuring gays. Even if it's about two fellows who aren't just  ""vicious in their own relationship. They're vicious to other people.""

A very enjoyable over-the-top show with two pros flaunting their acting chops. I'm looking forward to the second series!

6365276,5,B00JJRLG7G,"Love it!!! This sitcom is my new addiction.  It is about a homosexual couple, not a ""lovey-dovey"" couple, but one of the most bitter ones Ive ever seen on TV.  However, bitterness has never been so deliciously funny.  These two individuals have been together for ever, I believe almost 50 years, and just when you think they have finally had enough of each other, they show you that their love for each other is stronger than their petty arguments.  The acting is phenomenal, and the writing is genius.  With all the stress we have in our lives, we don't need one more reality show on TV.  So... Ill stick to shows like this one.

But --- instead we get consistently, and without explanation, ""Endeavor,"" a show which we have no interest in at all. What in the hell is happeninig at Amazon ?
Most frustrating than all else at this point is the total failure on Amazon's part to make itself available either for an explanation or solution. Forget all about finding, let alone contacting, HELP. The two phone #s we have are both non-working and it appears, despite the fact that we purchased this Episode as well as Episode One,  that Amazon has permanently caused its sudden and unexplained disappearance for many loyal Amazon Prime subcribers. In its stead, Amazon has, for absolutely no discernable reason, chosen to  replace it with a mediocre bit of crap. (At least, Amazon could have given us ""Morse"" --a much more tolerable and interesting work..)

6365299,4,B00JJRLG7G,"Uncertain is a word I might use about this series. Vicious is the tale of two Gay men, Freddie, played by Ian McKellen, and Stuart, played by Derek Jacobi. They have lived together for 48 years, but Stuart has not been able to find the 'right time' to tell his mother. Freddie and Suart live in a flat in London filled with all of their old keepsakes. In Freddie's case, it is his acting awards, in Stuart's case it is the urns of the remains of their friends who have died off.

Freddie seems the most vicious to me with his words, but they seem to make up soon after Stuart is finished pouting. Both of these characters play stereotypical Gay men. That is my dilemma, is this a good thing in this day and age? Into this flat, a young man named Ash , played by Iwan Rheon, arrives, looking for a new apartment. Since he is so handsome and young, they both quickly invite him in. Much of the first episode is guessing whether he is straight or Gay. Joining them is Stuart's friend, Violet, played by Frances de la Tour. What her role is, except to identify what their squabbles are all about, I am not sure. It may be that she provides some humour. I wonder if the young Gay crowd will be attracted to this show. I found it somewhat humorous except for the constant viciousness. But, after all the series is named, Vicious.

How about starring in a short TV sitcom series with simple premise, small cast and a laugh track? That's what has happened to both SIR Ian McKellen and SIR Derek Jacobi. And the result is this British TV series that began airing in the US this week on PBS and is being released on DVD by PBS Home Video.

As I post this review all the previous reviewers have discussed the broadcast version of the series. I was provided a copy of the DVD by PBS for review and I hope to provide you with info on the DVD and how it differs from the TV version.

First, I should point out that this show was not made for the BBC but rather for the commercial network ITV. The ""series"" was short - just six episodes (each lasting just 22 minutes) - plus there was a ""Christmas Special"" (which runs 26 minutes. This, of course allowed for commercials. Per reviews posted of the UK DVD version, the ""Christmas Special"" was not included on that release. Thankfully it is here; it is the best episode.

The plot of the series is that two outwardly gay men - McKellen and Jacobi - have been living together for nearly half a century and are now in the ""cat fighting"" period of their relationship. Though you know they really care for each other deep inside, outwardly then speak to each other with snide remarks. The show is the creation of Gary Janetti  - who was involved with ""The Family Guy"" and  ""Will & Grace"" and is filled with lots of often-funny tongue-lashing repartee.  With only one exception, all seven episodes take place on the same living room or kitchen set.  And, after the first episode (which you need to see to understand the characters - there are only six actors in the whole series) there is not much plot development.  I'm not even sure that the same lines are not reused.

I highly recommend that those interested in seeing the show wait for the DVD version for a number of reasons.
Because the shows are so short - together with the ""Christmas Special"" the running time is just 3  hours, you can easily watch the whole thing in one sitting - or maybe two.  And, as I said, some of the episodes are almost repeats of the previous ones. Then there is the editing. While I have not seen the PBS broadcast version, I am certain it was edited for language - the S-word is used often as well as the name of a particular male body part.

The actors - other than McKellen and Jacobi - are well cast with some very funny British character actors as Freddie's (McKellen) and Stuart's (Jacobi) friends and Iwan Rheon as Ash, the young  and -  to the frustration of Stuart and Freddie - straight young man who rents the apartment upstairs.

There are really two ""must see"" episodes here. The first one, which - as I said - sets up the plot- and stands on its own and the ""Christmas Special"" which (after you know the relationships between the cast members) is downright hilarious! (Especially the lines  coming from the memory-failing Penelope (Marcia Warren.)  The remaining episodes are ""just ok"" in my opinion.

All the prior reviews posted gave the DVD five stars. I can't go that far because some of the episodes didn't garner a laugh for me, but mostly because the producers felt that, rather than filming in front of a live audience (the set is not unlike that of the hit ""The Big Bang Theory""), they use a laugh track, which sounds forced.  Hence the four stars.
Oh yes, the DVD also contains one ""Special Feature"": An interview with cast and crew. Actually it's just some of the cast members promoting the show - with some scenes included - and it runs just over two minutes! Interesting but not essential. And there are English subtitles as an option, though I don't think you'll need them.

The series was renewed for a second season to be recorded in 2014. I'm hoping that the story takes them out of their living room and lets them interact with others more often. I guess we'll see.

I'l included a ""promo"" clip"" of the series - though note that the laugh track does not appear in the promo.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6365301,5,B00JJRLG7G,"Campy and biting, but a pretty simple formula with two memorable actors and a good supporting cast.  If you go into it expecting Shakespeare, you'll be disappointed.  If you go into it expecting (and have the tolerance for) a good mindless half hour escape of catty digs and crude (but often funny) jokes, you won't be disappointed.  I don't know that it'll ever be a smash hit and I'm sure it has its share of critics, but I like the lead actors, I like the old style sitcom formula they're using, and I'm not easily offended by toilet humor.",1404172800,5,543,4.4646464646464645
