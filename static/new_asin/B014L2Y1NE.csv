It is very colorful and surprisingly sharp considering it was shot in half frame Techniscope, thus robbing it of a 50% improvement had they rented the scope lens like a normal human being. But then,there are no long shots in a studio shoot like this, so they get by. Only the unkind will try to point out this film's antecedents.",1446249600,3,384,4.422535211267606

Is it possible that since I've been viewing substandard versions of this movie for years, this release by Olive Films is so stunning to me?  Could be and, TBH, I don't care.  Colors are great, I just don't care that it's letterboxed, and I don't give a damn about its lacking ""extras.""  I'm also betting that the copies I'm giving out this Christmas will also be enjoyed.",1446163200,12,538,4.505154639175258
7414506,4,B014L2Y1NE,"Well at last the long wait is finally over. A proper aspect ratio of the movie that essentially launched Amicus Productions back in 1965 has finally made it to Region 1 and on Blu-Ray too. The quality of the transfer is quite decent but having been shot in Techniscope (the poor man's Cinemascope), the film still has black bars at the top and bottom even on a wide screen TV. You would think for a Blu-Ray release there would have been an anamorphic transfer to take care of that but as an earlier reviewer warned, this was going to be a bare bones release and it is. There are no extras of any kind. No commentary, no subtitles for the hard-of-hearing, no special short features, even the chapters are poorly executed. Olive Films does make rare films available (mostly from the Paramount library - Hey! how about releasing Roger Vadim's BLOOD & ROSES on DVD/Blu-Ray) but they certainly are a no frills outfit. That's the bad news. Fortunately the good news outweighs the bad.

The good news remains the film itself. This was the first Amicus anthology and it remains one of the most engaging even if the stories are uneven and the special effects aren't all that special. The first story (of 5) about a werewolf's curse is the best from a horror standpoint while the sparring between Michael Gough and art critic Christopher Lee in the fourth story remains a delight (the identity of the mystery painter is priceless). Roy Castle's jazz voodoo sequence has dated the most but the killer plant story is truly di-vine. It's fascinating to see the young Donald Sutherland but his small town doctor story lacks bite. No matter, Peter Cushing owns this film as the title character. You can't take your eyes off him and it's a pleasure to hear him speak. The soundtrack transfer is excellent with Elizabeth Luytens' modern score adding much to the proceedings. In spite of the Blu-Ray's shortcomings, this is still the best the film has ever looked in Region 1 so I can't complain that much. The U.K. release will be more deluxe but I know this movie so well that I don't really need extras. There may be a better release down the road but for now, this one will do nicely.",1445904000,19,2170,4.607235142118863
7414507,5,B014L2Y1NE,"DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS is a 5-segment anthology film from Amicus studios. Five men on a train encounter the mysterious Dr. Schreck (Peter Cushing- THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS, HORROR EXPRESS) of the title. He tells each man's future w/ a deck of Tarot cards. Story #1 concerns an ancient manor, a werewolf, and a family curse. Story #2 is about a jazz musician who pisses off a voodoo god, inciting its wrath. The third tale is best described as a killer plant / vine movie (sort of a cousin of DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS). The fourth installment stars Christopher Lee (THE SKULL, THE OBLONG BOX) as a pompous art critic, plagued by an artist's (Michael Gough- HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM, KONGA, HORROR HOSPITAL) disembodied extremity. The final segment stars Donald Sutherland (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS '78) as a newlywed whose bride just might be a vampire.

7414511,4,B014L2Y1NE,"I am updating my earlier review of the film, now including the actual review of the DVD itself. This is a Blu-Ray release by Olive Films. The film was produced in 1964, in color, running 98 minutes long, in a 2:35:1 aspect ratio. It is NR. The quality of the image transfer is decent enough, but I was disappointed in that there are no extras whatsoever: no closed captions for the hearing impaired nor commentary. And it is a Region 1 DVD which will play on US Blu-Ray DVD players. That is about it. Below is a review of the film itself, one of my favorite classic horror anthologies.

This Amicus portmanteau film,  presents five stories within a framed story. The story begins with five gentlemen boarding a train, and all find themselves in the same carriage. Then the five men are joined by the last passenger, a rather strange man who introduces himself as Dr. Schreck (you'll have to look closely to figure out that it is horror icon Peter Cushing, wearing a beard and fake eyebrows). Interestingly, 'shreck' also means 'terror' in German, and the five passengers discover soon enough the terror that awaits them all. Shreck presents a deck of Tarot cards and each passenger picks one and in successive turns gets his fortune told.

The first story was my favorite, centering on a young architect, Jim Dawson (Neil McCallum) who finds himself being sent by his boss to the Scottish Hebrides islands to oversee some remodeling project in his old ancestral home, now occupied by a widow, Mrs. Biddulph (Ursula Howells). Jim senses something is afoot by the sinister looks that pass between the old caretaker and his young granddaughter, and also the strange sounds of a wolf howling nearby. Jim discovers much later (and to his horror) that his very life is at stake. The atmosphere and the old manor house that is the setting for this story make this segment of the anthology engaging and creepy.

The second story centers around Bill Rogers (Alan Freeman) who returns with his wife and young daughter after a family vacation only to find that there is a vine that has taken root outside their home. This vine is no ordinary plant, and seems to have murderous instincts! The third story revolves around jazz musician Biff Bailey (Roy Castle) who commits the fatal mistake of stealing a voodoo chant and adapting it for a music performance, not realizing that this blasphemous act has angered a voodoo god.

The fourth story is about ruthless art critic Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) who drives a painter to commit suicide, and later finds himself being haunted by one of the man's body parts. The last story is about Dr. Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) who returns from the Continent with a lovely young bride. Soon after they make themselves at home, Carroll and his partner, Dr. Blake (Max Adrian) find a young patient who shows evidence of being the victim of a vampire, and Blake later persuades Carroll to not only believe in vampires, but that it is Carroll's own bride who is a vampire!

The main frame basically ties in all the stories with the question - How do these five men prevent their ultimate fate? Is there a chance for escape? I thought the effects toward the end were rather cheesy and a bit of a let down (not to mention predictable), but the individual stories are actually quite watchable, though I would recommend this strictly for fans of classic and atmospheric horror (those who are only familiar with and fans of modern day horror movies will find these tales slow, lacking gore, and boring). As a fan of classic horror though, I enjoyed it!",1441152000,32,3577,4.7243589743589745

Amicus did several of these compartmentalized types of films, but none with the cast of this one, to be sure.  The best fortune reading of all is the plant one, though it's quite fake, the moving vines clearly held off-camera by film crew. Be sure to look for the easter-egg poster in the Voodoo story and the twist ending of the vampire story with Don Sutherland, too.

7414524,4,B014L2Y1NE,"These early Amicus films are great fun because they are so similar to Hammer films of the period.  ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"" is no exception and if you've only seen the film in 16mm pan-and-scan prints for TV, seeing it widescreen will be a treat.

This print looks great, and shows how good these movies look when they are spared an arbitrary ""restoration.""  Unlike the disastrous ""restoration"" done on ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" (another British Techniscope film from 1965), ""Dr. Terror"" is presented in bright, clear colors true to the director's original intent.

Although this is a blu-ray, be prepared for some softer than usual cinematography.  This is partly due to the Techniscope process (which utilized only 1/2 of a 35mm frame), and partly because the cinematographer filmed many scenes using a ""diffusion disc,"" which intentionally softens the edges of a picture for a slightly hazy effect.

Like Hammer films from the period, Amicus' early works seem to play best when set in a medieval castle or a Victorian mansion.  The sets are beautiful, the cast talented and attractive (except for gooey eyesore Donald Sutherland), and the music is moody and effective.

As all anthologies should, the film starts and ends strong, with the weakest link saved for the middle.  I'm referring to the ""Voodoo"" story, which is ruined (for me, anyway) by the presence of an obnoxious black nightclub character whose cranium is shaped like a fez.  Sambo sings two numbers which will replay in your brain for days after watching this film.  Britain's real-life jazz combo, ""Tubby Hayes Quintet,"" is featured in this story, and their cool jazz opening tune is great.  If only the producers had left the focus on them and the swinging '60s nightclub scene!

I liked this film and hope you will, too.",1482278400,10,1802,4.966666666666667

7414533,3,B014L2Y1NE,"BOTTOM LINE: While not as scary as some of its similarly-styled brethren, DR. TERROR still has a few decent chills up his sleeve... if you dare to join him for the evening! 3 STARS

THE STORY: Four train passengers sharing the same berth spend the evening investigating the darker side of the paranormal, guided by a mysterious man among them who has a deck of unusual tarot cards. The fate each sees for himself is told as a separate story, via flashback. Exactly who is the strange and enigmatic Dr. Terror? What do the four men have in common with him... and each other???

THOUGHTS: Another short story format film in the same vein as TALES FROM THE CRYPT, VAULT OF HORROR, CREEPSHOW and others. As always, it's great fun to see Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on screen together again. The other actors are serviceable enough in their roles but, disappointingly, the stories here are more light-hearted than in other films of this kind. If those movies were rated R then this entry would be a soft PG. On the plus side, the movie has good sets, lighting, photography and a decent musical score. Worth a look if you're into multi-story spook flicks.

THE BLU-RAY: The Olive Films release of DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS sports a nice, clean transfer. Solid picture with crisp focus and a strong, level soundmix. Not much in the way of annoying artifacting, pixelation or edge enhancement and minimal crush (video noise). Zero bonus features, which is a bummer, but not uncommon with films being resurrected onto Blu-ray by smaller companies like Olive Films and Kino Lorber. While it would be great to have all sorts of interesting trivial tidbits tossed in, I'm frankly just glad to see so many of these obscure titles seeing the light of day again after spending so many decades languishing in dusty film vaults - and most in such nice-looking/sounding versions, too.",1468886400,5,1876,4.783950617283951

7414544,3,B014L2Y1NE,"I love old horror films. The focus isn't about grossing people out. It's about atmosphere. It's about creating a sense of dread. ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"" an early Amicus production does a nice job on a small budget ($100,000) of creating an atmospheric minor classic that compared well to Hammer's productions. What was unique about Amicus was the anthology films that they did. These type of films rise or fall on the total strength of the majority of the stories and even the bracketing stories (some stories here are a little better than others with one story clearly an inspiration of a bad movie ""The Happening"")

I haven't viewed the British version but, if this German version is the same (I'm assuming so because it has the Pinewood Studio Restoration tag) or at least comparable I can at least speak to the restoration.  I went with the German editon which features many special features and a superior transfer of the film that is also used for the UK version. Be aware, however, that the skin tones tend a little more to yellow than the more robust tan skins in the U.S. Release--the difference comes down to color timing  but this is something you can manually adjust on your own monitor. Because of the flexibility of a no region disc, I picked the German over the UK. You don't need to know German to watch this (although there are German specific extras).

I Can't confirm which one is correct but the German does have a slight yellowish tinge which alters the skin tones so slightly.

Assembling a strong cast (Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Donald Sutherland--before fame came to him with ""M*A*S*H"") and solid director (Freddie Francis two time Oscar winner for his photography and a regular director for Hammer) and well written script. This wasn't the first British horror film to use the anthology format. ""Dead of Night"" preceded ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"".

Dr. Terror (Cushing) arrives late for a train squeezing in with a group of American and English men varying from an art critic, musician to businessmen. When he spills his Tarot cards and then offers to tell each man what his future holds--none of them pleasant.

The film is still fun--if a bit uneven--with some stories really good and others, well, not so much. Either way, the performances of Cushing, Lee, Michael Gough, Sutherland and others are still top notch even if the stories are not always great.

The Olive Films version appears to be a transfer from an inferior source when compared to the German region free release. There are a number of minor problems and clarity, depth, etc. are better for the German version(which is the Pinewood restoration but the UK release is not region free as I recall). The German version is a wee bit more expensive but Amazon Germany sells it and will ship to the U.S. It does, however, have the shot at the end of the film of the Grim Reaper. That was never part of the negative and added to the interpositive (which is why it is missing from the German and UK versions of the film which is for a restored negative).

The audio for the two versions is much closer but the German edition beats the Olive Films version ever so slightly.

The special features for this vintage films is where the German edition trumps the Olive Films release. Would it have hurt Olive films to license these? Nope. They were produced for the German market (well most of them).

We get two commentary tracks--one by the late Freddie Francis (ported over from the DVD overseas) with Jonathan Sothcott. Sothcott acts as a good moderator should--he prods Francis to remember as much as he can about the making of the film and his career.

We get a nearly one hour documentary ""House of Cards"" that goes into the details of the origin of Amicus, the film and the various performers. It's an excellent documentary with great and insightful comments (particularly about the origin of the stories for the film). It's in English so could easily have been licensed for the Olive release.

There's also a German commentary track, introduction and version of the film that played in Germany (in German naturally) that is not restored. It's pulled from a vintage 35mm print.

We also get the German opening and closing of the film. Italian opening and closing credits. We also get English, German and Italian trailers as well as a stills gallery.

So, if you are a fan of the film, the German version is the one to get unless an inferior transfer and a lack of special features appeal to you, the Olive films version is the one to get. If you want to and can spend a bit more coin, the German version is the way to go.",1454716800,4,4626,4.672816728167282

7414552,3,B014L2Y1NE,"One of the best of Amicus's Horror anthologies, Director Freddie Francis's 'DR.TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS'-1964 is finally given a stateside release by Olive Films.  This film is very dear to my heart because it was the first film I actually viewed by myself in a theater without my parents and friends at the ripe old age of ten years old. You've read the reviews about the stories over the years so now lets get to the bad news.  The transfer by Olive Films is extremely disappointing .  The abundance of grain in some of the sequences really shows and the contrast is extremely bright giving the flesh tones on the actors an amber orange tone in some scenes.  Yes , we finally have a 2.35 widescreen print, however, it was released in Technicolor/Techniscope. This negative does not look like a Technicolor transfer at all but a decent Eastmancolor print which makes buying the DVD release better than acquiring the Blu-ray.  I can't believe that some of the reviewers actually lauded this release's quality unless their monitors and computers are set differently. If you want to see the quality I am writing about, view the Kino Lorber Blu-ray of Director Mario Bava's 'THE WHIP AND THE BODY'-1963 and you will see a breathtaking technicolor transfer in comparison.  Unfortunately, this release will have to do until Paramount gives it a decent release.  Olive films also releases it with no extras, not even a trailer. Just to reiterate, the film is a five star classic but I am giving it three stars for the quality of the Blu-Ray. Overall, one of the biggest disappointments released this year so purchase the DVD instead.",1451433600,,1628,4.813620071684587

Film looks perfectly fine on Blu-ray though, and is a must have for fans of Peter Cushing and the recently deceased Christopher Lee, who are by far the best things about it. Donald Sutherland also costars.",1446508800,,405,4.71830985915493

8731266,3,B014L2Y1NE,Nostalgia made me buy this DVD.  It's not a great movie but it brings memories of one evening in 1966 when I saw the movie at a cinema theatre.  I was spookily startled towards the end of the movie when Dr. Terror showed his true face.  Face - what face?  The stories are quite interesting but it lacks a sense of terror - not thrilling or spooky enough.  Dr. Terror - where's your terror (other than at the end of the movie).,1526947200,,426,4.146341463414634

8731269,3,B014L2Y1NE,"This 1965 film was the first of the Amicus omnibus or multi-story horror pictures with a wrap-around story.  To me, it's more enjoyable for its set-up than for the execution.  Four amiable young professional men and a snooty snob assemble in a train compartment from London with a mysterious, bearded man (Peter Cushing) who agrees to tell their fortunes with Tarot cards.  The early winter evening is dark, foggy, misty, and ominous as the train rattles along.  Each fortune is visualized as a tale of supernatural terror ending in DEATH.  The yarns about the werewolf and the creeping vines are really weak.  The one about the jazz musician stealing a voodoo instrumental from Haiti is slightly better.  The story about an American doctor (Donald Sutherland) suspecting his wife is a vampire, who amazingly is untroubled by daylight, is a little better still.  The best tale has the pretentious and arrogant art critic (Christopher Lee) in an escalating feud with a painter (Michael Gough) which ends with the artist's death.  The severed hand of the painter returns to haunt the terrified critic, no matter how many times the critic seems to have disposed of it for good.  The tag line of the ambulance driver is memorable.  The film winds up with the five men seeing the truth of Dr. Terror's predictions.  This movie is somewhat fun for its concept, only scary enough to frighten small children, and directed without much flair by Freddie Francis.  Amicus would make six more horror omnibus films, the best being the final one, ""From Beyond the Grave"" (1974).  The picture, color, and sound on this Olive Films edition are great.  Recommended for showing at a children's Halloween party, as it is unlikely to give them bad dreams.",1515283200,,1735,4.914089347079038
8731270,5,B014L2Y1NE,"Being an avid Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee fan for most, if not all of their movies, this is no exception. Although, I give high marks for the movie itself and it being in HD Blu-ray, I really had hoped Scream Factory or Kino Lorber would have distributed this one. Olive films, on the other hand, is quite well known for not having any kind of special features, not even subtitles or closed captioning. They did the same thing with the original
""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with Kevin McCarthy.
The movie looks decent here on the Blu-ray format, giving it some more life. I am sure it is better than any other release beforehand. I played this back on my 55"" Ultra 4K TV and Sony Blu-ray player. Looked and sounded good.
AMICUS did a good job here with this anthology of ""terror"" stories. If you liked or loved ""Tales From The Crypt"" (which Peter also stars), then you will like or love this one, too!",1511740800,,907,4.503030303030303
8731271,1,B014L2Y1NE,"I was peeved when I opened the menu of this Olive release and discovered that to save a few bucks, nobody could be bothered to include a basic DVD feature like closed captioning or subtitles. As a viewer who's half-deaf, particularly as regards my watching of English films in which actors speak with heavy accents, I rely on these heavily to derive even the minimal enjoyment from what I'm watching. As a result, I really can't tell you if this first of the delightful Amicus portmanteau movies is any good or not, since the sound quality here also seems pretty poor. I wouldn't have minded spending a little more on this for captions. I gave this one star for Olive's presentation, not for the flick itself. Call this ""horror on the cheap.""",1506988800,3,742,4.628787878787879
