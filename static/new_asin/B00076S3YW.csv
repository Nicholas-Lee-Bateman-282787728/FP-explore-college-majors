8045120,3,B00076S3YW,I was disappointed.  I have a new puppy who was about 9 weeks old at the time.  I was most interested in house training the dog.  The only recommendation she gave was when you first bring the puppy home.  I  already had the dog at least 2 weeks when I purchased the video.  I bought it used and paid over $20 for it.  Her tip for training the dog was useless if your dog had already been allowed to walk in the house.  Most people do not get a video on training a dog until they have the dog.  The video seemed trite and unreal.  All the dogs caught on immediately it seemed.  It was not helpful to me.,1240876800,,602,3.9747899159663866
