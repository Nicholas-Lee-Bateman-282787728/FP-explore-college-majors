2681420,5,B000K0ZT88,"This is my second purchase in the series.  I purchased Level 1 before taking a tap class and found it really helped my understanding and progression in the class. I am a true beginner, never having taken a tap class prior to using this DVD series. Level 2 is a great teaching DVD as well and better than a live class because you can go at your own pace.  It is easy to follow and understand.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in tap!",1313107200,4,443,4.188235294117647
2681421,5,B000K0ZT88,"I ordered the Level1&2 for my husband. He really loved everything about these DVD! He has taken tap lessons before and found it not worth the money but when he tried these DVDs he was so impressed with the simplicity of instruction he was glad I had ordered both levels! To tell the truth, I was so mesmerized myself that I started dancing too!  This product is worth  every penny and Amazon as usual was superb with it's on or before time shipping.",1312156800,5,449,4.397590361445783
2681422,5,B000K0ZT88,"Tap Dance Made Easy Level 2 is as well made as Level 1, with clear, multiple-camera-views work and clear oral communication.

It's a joy to learn (especially at age 65) to tap from this series!

Very highly recommended.",1285891200,3,219,4.7368421052631575
2681423,4,B000K0ZT88,"I really like the split view on the screen that shows both angles of the instructors feet.  The steps are fast paced, so as a beginner I had to pause the video to get the steps right before going along with him.  This is a great video for someone who has the basics down and wants to improve their speed.",1228176000,4,304,4.05
2681424,5,B000K0ZT88,"Eli Newsom's Tap Dance Made Easy is simply awesome!  I studied tap for 10 years in my youth, but hadn't used it in years...Tap Dance Made Easy not only refreshed my memory, but taught me more detail about each step than I ever knew, making my technique better than it was in my prime!  The Level 1 DVD is great for getting a solid foundation with Tap itself and for learning the basic steps.  I use the Level 2 DVD to practice the more complicated (and impressive) steps that require enhanced footwork - it also contains realistic dance combinations,  putting all the steps together as one would in a performance or an audition.

Before I found Tap Dance Made Easy, I tried other instructional DVD's and didn't find them to be as effective.  One thing that is so helpful with Tap Dance Made Easy is the split-screen view of the instructor.  One view shows him doing the steps with his back to the camera - like you're in a real dance class!  The other view is a close-up on his feet from the side, allowing you to learn more detail about how each step is done and how each sound is made.  Another great characteristic of this DVD set is that each step is broken into its own chapter on the DVD making it easy to skip around the disc and focus on the steps you want to practice, without having to fast-forward through a lot of video.

I heard that Eli Newsom is going to release a Tap Dance Made Easy - Level 3 soon and that it will be a ""Time Step Bootcamp""!  I can't wait for this!

I highly recommend this disc and this series.  Whether you are like me and want to brush up on skills and keep them sharp, or if you are a total beginner who wants to see if you enjoy Tap Dance before investing in live classes, then the Tap Dance Made Easy series is the way to go!",1226966400,41,1765,4.201780415430267
2681425,5,B000K0ZT88,"Elis is a talent dancer/instructor, he is relaxed and encouraging. I highly recommend this dvd as it is so well done and makes learning to tap easy and fun.",1225065600,3,156,4.413793103448276
2681426,5,B000K0ZT88,"I purchased Tap Dance Made Easy Level 2 for my 12-year-old daughter's birthday.  She and a younger sister have been taking tap dancing classes at a local dance studio and found this DVD great for clarifying what they thought they knew. The split-screen view, showing a full body on one side and the close-up of his feet from another angle, helps the viewer see what's really going on.  My daughter said I should mention that the tips are very helpful.  We liked that the look is contemporary, no straw hats or canes.",1220572800,13,516,4.586956521739131
2681427,3,B000K0ZT88,"Areas for improvement are as follows.
1.  Camera work is very out of focus, but fun to watch once you get past that.
2.  It may be difficult to go to your dance lesson & request help with move ""x,"" as instructor has made specific sequences for routines and just teaches you the routine as a whole, although some moves are listed on a slide before the sequence begins.
3.  My dvd was also bought new but came with scratches on it, I'm not sure why.

I did end up keeping the dvd, because I felt that the positives outweighed the negatives (though barely).",1210636800,,554,4.298076923076923
2681428,5,B000K0ZT88,"I got the DVD from the official site and it's very good indeed, I started to tap with the first volume and it's has been a lot of fun. I'm 38 years old. Together with the DVDs you have two booklets explaining the steps. You will find them on the official site. They explain the steps in a very clear way and they are fun to read.
Eli, congratulation for the good job. Can't wait for the 3rd volume.

Instructions are very easy to follow Eli Newsom is precise. I like the idea of bein able to play one particular practice over and over until steps have been thoroughly learnt",1372550400,,206,4.421052631578948
2681445,5,B000K0ZT88,"Excellent learning tool! Very impressive and Easy to follow instructions. If you want to learn at your own pace and not in a classroom, then this is a recommended way to do so.

2681446,5,B000K0ZT88,"I got the Level 1 DVD and did so well with it, I decided to get the next level, even though I'm not ready yet. The teacher is excellent, the views make every step easy to follow. I'm tapping in my living room, alone, just to get a little bit of exercise. I'm 57 and always wanted to learn to tap, but do not want to commit to lessons as my schedule is erratic and sometimes demanding. This series of DVDs is a great solution.",1363392000,2,425,4.011764705882353
2681447,3,B000K0ZT88,"This is a good video, has nice angles, etc.  My only complaint would be that the faster sections come a little too early on; however, it is a video, so you can just go back and keep doing the slower ones until you feel ready...",1361145600,,227,4.044444444444444
2681448,3,B000K0ZT88,"I've taken tap for 3 years, and my instructor called my class ""intermediate."" I do dance DVD's for an aerobic workout, so I started with #4 of this series, the cardio workout. Some steps have different names than I learned, and some steps are new to me, so that one's challenging but fun.

 Level 2, though, is very different. My problems with it won't matter to everyone, I admit; but maybe some shoppers will want to know. The first thing I noticed is it's dark! The lighting is too subtle for me; I have trouble seeing the instructor's feet clearly enough. He demonstrates at a slower speed, but doesn't explain much; then he dances the step faster. For example, the first step is shuffles done in different positions, one of which goes side-to-side. I wanted that one slowed down more but it wasn't. I could wing it, and have fun, but maybe not do it quite right.

Also, this one instructs each step in a separate segment with a pause of several seconds in between, so use it to learn rather than to get your heart rate up.",1344297600,2,1027,4.452127659574468
