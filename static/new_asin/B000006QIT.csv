8585511,5,B000006QIT,"Anyone who has benefited from Dale Carnegie's books: ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and ""How to Stop Worrying and Start Living"", will enjoy seeing this video.  When you can see the story of the man behind the principles, it brings the material in the books to life.
In my humble opinion, Dale Carnegie has done more to help human beings deal with the problems of life than most philosophers.  His down to earth writings about things that really matter to people will be remembered for centuries.
Dale Carnegie has had an enormously positive affect on my life.  I truly love and respect this man and enjoyed the video immensely.",1010793600,8,638,4.72972972972973
