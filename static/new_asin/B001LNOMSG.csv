8318953,3,B001LNOMSG,"Here we have another copy cat James Bond Euro Spy thriller which were so prominant in the late sixties. Stewart Granger, in an extremely annoying and vindictive performance,is in Hong Kong trying to thwart the smuggling of nuclear weapons.  Throw in fetching Rosanna Schiaffino as his partner and things start moving, unfortunately ,very slowly. You will see many Euro stalwarts such as Horst Frank,and Sieghardt Rupp.  The direction by Ernst Hofbrauer is strictly by the book and the movie score by Riz Ortolani gives the movie a much needed boost. All in all, a nice time waster for a Saturday afternoon.  The quality looks like its from a 16mm print in full screen and colors fluctuate throughout.  Its nostalgic, none the less.",1276387200,5,731,4.967213114754099
