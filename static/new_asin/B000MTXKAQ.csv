8172387,4,B000MTXKAQ,I can't think of anything more enjoyable than watching a six hour defensive driving video. This one isn't too bad.,1425945600,,114,4.75
8172388,5,B000MTXKAQ,Best DD course out there! I have used this course for years!,1417824000,,60,4.083333333333333

HOWEVER: if you are using this video to complete a Defensive Driving Course, you are in for
a very frustrating and hair pulling ride!!
You better take LOTS of notes : they will ask you obscure questions about the names of the people in
  the video. write every name down and what they talked about!
  Write EVERY statistic down, you will be quizzed.
  Take notes where everything is VERY EASY to find, you only have 30 sec!!!
  If you don't have several pages of notes, you haven't taken enough

Have your birth certificate in front of you: VERY detailed questions asked! Don't assume you know what your
  parents put!
Have you physical drivers license in front of you: Don't assume YOU know what is on there! Mine was renewed a
  couple of months ago, and after 25 years, DPS left off
  my middle initial! They asked my middle initial, and I got it
  wrong! (because it wasn't there!!).I had not noticed it.

Get all info on past marriages handy: They will ask for info!!

Get all info on your vehicle ready: They will ask for info!

You only get so many wrong answers , they they kick you out and you have to pay again!!

Do not use this if you have dial-up : if you have any problems and call them, they will tell you to get
  high-speed or go to a library and watch it! (yeah, that is practical!)

Final words: It is nice to sit and home and watch in your pj's. But numerous phone calls and hand cramps from
  note taking , not so much!",1357862400,4,1547,4.28125
8172391,1,B000MTXKAQ,Not as described. Thought would be able to use for teaching defensive driving here in Georgia but not able to use.,1355356800,,114,4.476190476190476
8172392,3,B000MTXKAQ,"Wheels in Motion is a driving curriculum, all together on one DVD.  It's full of great information that the state requires that every driver knows when taking their written test.  This DVD is an ideal companion to the classroom instruction and driving time behind the wheel.  But it's not the whole story.  You can only learn so much when being passively filled with information.  I was far more impressed with the driving simulator, SimuRide Home Edition, which puts you in the driver's seat without leaving home.  The situations you experience on your PC will give you a much more effective education.",1328572800,,603,4.920792079207921
