8600675,1,B00E3P5HVA,"This dvd is a puzzle.  Rene Chateau issued two important Georges Franju features on the same day in February 2013.  Both claim to be restorations, of both image and sound.  THERESE DESQUEYROUX is satisfactory.  The 1:1.66 image almost fills the screen, as it should; the visuals are free of damage.  THOMAS L'IMPOSTEUR is inexplicably letterboxed . When I saw these films when they were new, at the National Film Theatre in London, the aspect ratio was the 'old' one of 1:1.375, which means they must have been shot full matte.  The visuals are spotty and the soundtrack apparently damaged,  with a continuous hum through  the latter part.  One wonders about the restoration claim - whether Rene Chateau merely started with a good print of THERESE and a bad one of THOMAS.  Both films are in need of  Criterion's attention.  The films are in French, without even French subtitles for 'sourds et malentants'.  Both films are available on the no-frills (no case, no extras, no booklet) Movie Detective  label.  Both offer English subtitles.  THERESE is, if not the equal of a Criterion restoration, a decent transfer.  THOMAS would be - it fills the screen, or almost: the aspect ratio is 1:1.66 - but there is a maddening thin white line where the image meets the narrow black gap - a constant distraction in the corner of one's eye.  So come on, Criterion - restore THOMAS L'IMPOSTEUR.",1388361600,,1385,4.821276595744681
