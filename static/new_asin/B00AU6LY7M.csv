5510209,5,B00AU6LY7M,I would give any John Wayne movie that he doesn't sing 5 stars.,1420243200,,63,3.923076923076923
5510210,1,B00AU6LY7M,"+All early John Wayne films are sort of treat to watch, but this release by Desert Island Films is absolutely the worst. It appears to be made from a VHS tape and I believe is a DVD-R.  I have tried to get the best copy available via Amazon and by far the best copy to date is on a 3 feature DVD by Alpha Video a pressed (DVD)  It is well worth  the money just for this film because of the quality.",1414454400,,398,3.8292682926829267
5510211,2,B00AU6LY7M,"Love John Wayne.  Love  old black & white movies.  This is not one of his best.  Movie should have been cut in half, two stories, and the actors as banditos, the accent doesn't work for me. Sounds more like an actor trying to sound like a bandito, French version.  Tore it for me, I turned it off.",1412726400,,297,4.140350877192983

It starts with a man lassoing a calf and then bulldogging; these are practical skills used in raising cattle. Then John is sent to help Hank Mason, a friend of his father. But when he arrives he is mistaken as a member of a gang of robbers and arrested. The Sheriff asks John for help as well (he saw what happened). There is a reign of terror in that area, cattle are stolen, barns are burned. This Sheriff asks John Allento work as an undercover investigator. Later five men try to drive his away, but fail. There is a chase. John gets away and meets a young lady. The five ride away when a posse of men arrive. Then the posse chases John! He is arrested and taken to town. Will these men make a hasty decision (no fair trial)? Miss Mason arrives to prevent this error. [Notice the doubled voice for singing?]

Hank Mason was last seen by Carter the banker. They are short on provisions as bandits attack any supply train; the bandits seem to know the schedule. John leads a wagon train with provisions to the valley. The gang will let them go through then attack from the rear. But there is a trap! The wagons contain men armed with rifles so the gang is driven off. [Where is the US Cavalry?] The ranchers must get their cattle to market to pay off their loans to Carters bank. [No government aid in those days.] The gang has a plan to beat up Middleton so he cant lead the herd to market. Will it succeed? The postmaster got a Wanted poster for John Allen. The gang learns about Middletown or Allen and plan to capture him and learn what hes up to.

White-faced Herefords are rounded up in preparation for the cattle drive. John Allen is brought to meet the gang. He asks about the layout, but they capture him and plan to steal the herd. John finally meets Hank Mason. Can they get untied and freed? They find horses and ride to warn the ranchers. They prepare to defend themselves. There is a lot of shooting. John rides after the gang leaders. One is shot, the other captured. They learn why the Martin gang tried to get rid of the ranchers. Hank Mason tells the good news to the other ranchers: there is a valuable mineral beneath their lands. They will go from poor to rich! [The wish of many during the Great Depression.]

This is a classic Western story about a group of small ranchers or homesteaders who are faced with theft of their land by a cattle baron or powerful banker (who represent Eastern financial interests). But with united action they can save their land or business. The Johnson County War inspired countless Western movies. The movie Shane was one of the last to use this plot. In most of John Waynes movies from the 1930s he played an undercover investigator from Washington (or Sacramento) sent to save the small farmers or ranchers from economic ruin.",1427155200,,2810,4.450485436893204
8557855,5,B00AU6LY7M,As  John Wayne fan sense childhood it is good to see his earlier work.  In this feature you can tell his is the best prepared of all the cast as was his nature to never walk onto a set and not be ready to give his best.,1425427200,,219,3.6382978723404253
