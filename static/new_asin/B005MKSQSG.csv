There is no top menu to pick which episode in the season you want to watch, meaning you have to skip through previously watched episodes to get to the next. Image quality is so poor that text displayed onscreen is blurry, much more than the first and second season DVDs that I have, even though season 7 is from 2011. The DVDs included have plain blue background pictures included on them, much different from the elaborate DVD pictures from season 1 and 2, and unlike those seasons, the season 7 box comes with no additional leaflet on the inside.

Im sad I didn't watch this when my return window was open, because I absolutely would return this in a heartbeat. Im certain I paid almost $30 for a piss poor pirated copy.

Ill include photos of the comparisons Ive made.

EDIT: at the bottom of the product description, Amazon writes: ""When sold by Amazon.com, this product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media."" This is why the quality reflects a pirated DVD. I stand by my original review and WOULD NOT recommend anyone to spend this kind of money on this home-burned DVD.",1510876800,,1250,4.596412556053812
