It is a classic and a must see for old school wrestling fans! Great nostilglia movie!",1439596800,,134,4.1923076923076925
6044421,2,B00G1L6V9Q,"I received a DVD of degraded picture quality.  The disc looks production quality.  When played, the DVD has a picture quality that looks like my brother's ""Kodak Super 8 to Betamax"" conversion, of my birth family's home movies.  From CFS Releasing.",1414195200,,248,5.0
6044422,1,B00G1L6V9Q,"Extremely poor quality source material - very dark with fuzzy, washed out colors and old VHS tape aged look - almost unwatchable. The nice cover artwork (though it's merely the poster from the film) and high price ($14.99 when released!) led me to believe this would be a quality edition. Can't believe I anxiously waited 2 - 3 months for this to hit the market and I can't imagine a lesser priced edition of this film being any worse. Do yourself a favor and spend $3.50 (currently) for the Echo Bridge edition. I've read some of the reviews on that one and sounds like it's identical quality/ non-quality.",1406419200,,607,4.62962962962963
6044423,5,B00G1L6V9Q,I am a avid WWF/AWA/WCW fan from 70s to now and this movie highlights alot of the wrestlers of the 70/80s era.,1404086400,,110,4.045454545454546
6044424,3,B00G1L6V9Q,I loved the movie but had to turn my television up all the way to barely hear it almost blowing my speakers when there was a random loud noise on the dvd.,1397088000,2,154,3.84375
6044425,5,B00G1L6V9Q,"This film does stands the test of time, die hard fans only, 5 star dvd, worth the money, great dvd.",1396051200,,99,4.0
8620101,5,B00G1L6V9Q,"What a cool piece of history, getting to see all the big names from the 80s. Some parts are serious, some are hilarious, all of it is good.",1524614400,,139,4.0

8620103,4,B00G1L6V9Q,Great old school wrestling nostalgia,1496102400,,36,6.4
8620104,5,B00G1L6V9Q,"I remember as a small child watching local wrestling and a trailer for The Wrestler was shown. I thought this film had disappeared from the face of the Earth. I remember doing an on line search for it not too long ago and found nothing.. anywhere.. I got it for nostalgia. Big fan of Bruiser and Crusher as a kid. My Uncle was actually friends with them. The quality of the transfer is a joke,but if this is the only available source,it's better than nothing.  Obviously taken from a VHS copy from somewhere. Glad I finally got to see this film. Avid wrestling fans and collectors of classic wrestling memorabilia will need to have this film in their collection.",1491091200,,662,4.563025210084033
8620105,1,B00G1L6V9Q,"Not a very 'grabbing' film. It's a film littered with 'name' wrestlers and that makes me wonder whether this film is for wrestling 'obsessives' only. The dialogue and 'acting' is rather stilted and doesn't really 'go' anywhere.
Someone in a review here mentioned that this was made 'before' wrestling went 'Hollywood'. I personally think it was made before anyone involved went to acting or film school.
Buy it if you 'must' but if you must 'buy"".",1480896000,,447,4.894736842105263
8620106,4,B00G1L6V9Q,"Hokey movie, but worth it to see the stars of yesyerday. Ric Flair in training with Chris Taylor. The Texas Outlaws (Rhodes and Murdock) Superstar Billy Graham and many many more. All from that famous barn of Verne Gagnes. Billy Robinson was at his peak and good footage of him.",1471910400,,278,4.58
8620107,5,B00G1L6V9Q,My son loves this movie!,1469750400,,24,4.0
8620108,4,B00G1L6V9Q,"i would give this a 5 star, if the quality was just a tiny bit better, im such a mark for this era in the pro wrestling business i give it a 4 star. this is a must for anyone who likes the AWA, texas outlaw, billy robinson era. vince sr. is in it, eddie graham all kinds of greats from that era.",1468454400,,295,3.6984126984126986
8620109,5,B00G1L6V9Q,older movie but very cool added it and want the same name dvd micky Rourke the wrestler to go with my 300 wrestling related dvds now as long as I can afford it bein disabled I'm not gonna buy dvd of wwe cuz I got the wwe internet site,1457222400,,234,3.795918367346939
8620110,1,B00G1L6V9Q,Quality of the transfer is awful. The pixelation makes it unwatchable.,1455062400,,70,5.454545454545454
