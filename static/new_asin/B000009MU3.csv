8363494,5,B000009MU3,"In this light-hearted modern day kung-fu comedy, a hard-to-find classic for collectors, a mischievous and naive monk (Ming Yeung) of the Shaolin Temple gets his first taste of life outside the temple. Peter Yuen has again directed a wonderful story and actors Chu Yin and Chun On star along with Yeung in this out-of-print 1995 film with English subtitles. If you ever have a chance to see this movie, definitely see it. I promise you'll want to go out and buy a copy of it for your own personal collection. Only problem is it's almost impossible to find anymore.",1193616000,,563,4.696969696969697
8363495,5,B000009MU3,"Not a movie, but documetary at best.  Don't expect acting or high picture quality, just REAL Shaolin Monks at best, showing 72 of thier most honarable techiniques.
Also features Li as a young boy, simply amazing. A must have for TRUE Kung-Fu fans.",986169600,9,247,4.744186046511628
8363496,5,B000009MU3,Great movie to appreciate the true art of Shaolin KungFu. Jet Li's kung fu is great and without tricks.,967075200,5,103,4.473684210526316
8363497,4,B000009MU3,"In the terms of action, this movie is fulfilling; a prime example of Li's famous agility and power. The only thing keeping this disc from being of  5-star quality is the somewhat mediocre acting. Don't get me wrong, it's  better acting than some martial arts movies display, but the acting gives  it the feel of a ""generic kung-fu"" movie at times. However, in  the end it is worth watching and for the true Jet Li fan, it should be a  part of your collection.",965088000,4,459,4.416666666666667
