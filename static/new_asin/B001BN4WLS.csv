It really amazes me that there are people out there who are actually trying to ratonalise the studio ripping off the fans of dynasty. Sorry but a retail price of $80 for a complete season of dynasty is not a good deal when the complete seasons of dallas are being offered for $40, do the math people! the studio would make a decent profit by issuing the entire season  for a retail price of $39.99 because THEY WOULD SELL MORE! For people who actually buy this volume, well, you deserve to be ripped off and I hope that sales are so poor that there will be no season 4 release",1218931200,7,653,4.141732283464567

3496588,1,B001BN4WLS,"I cannot find Dynasty Season 3.1 available through Amazon anymore. It is available elsewhere, but I was wondering if all of the negative reviews due to the Season Split caused someone to pay Amazon to have it pulled so that they may have some chance at selling a few copies of Season 3.2?

There have not been many TV series released in 2 boxes. Why do it to Dynasty ? This is really an insult.
I hope this is the 1st and the last time they do this and I also wish they will issue one box instead of 2 for season 3.
Dynasty is a true TV phenomena and even if the clothes are out of fashion, the haircuts way over the top and the plots sometimes really cheap, no one can deny that Dynasty is now a night soap classic.

3496612,4,B001BN4WLS,"This was a campy urban version of Dallas, but fun to follow. Dynasty tells the saga of oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), his second wife Krystle (Linda Evans) and his family. The first season was a build up for the first appearance of Blake's first wife, Alexis (Joan Collins). Alexis was a ruthless schemer. If there were such a course as Bitchology, Alexis would have had a PhD. The subplots become preposterous at times, but that makes it fun.
Krystle and Alexis clash, resulting in two cat fights in different seasons. Characters such as Krystle's golddigging niece Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) and mysterious supper club singer Dominique Devereaux (Diahann Carroll) add to the scheming. Over the top fun.",1333929600,,719,5.050420168067227

3496614,4,B001BN4WLS,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

Steven's wife Sammy Jo--who now prefers to be called Samantha (played by Heather Locklear)--returns from her New York ""modeling"" career with their baby son Danny, whom she first tries to sell to the Carrington family but settles on adoption when Blake (John Forsythe) and Krystle (Linda Evans), who still believe Steven to be dead, offer to raise the boy as their own.

Having successfully driven Jeff (John James) to the brink of crazy-town thanks to painting his office with toxic substances, Adam (Gordon Thomson) sets about getting Jeff to sign away his son's shares of Denver-Carrington...  Alexis (Joan Collins) calls her famous board meeting where she assumes joint control of ColbyCo. AND Denver-Carrington.

Steven (with the ""reconstructed"" face of Jack Coleman) returns to Denver where he wants to gain full custody of Danny; and Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) finally divorces Jeff and winds up in the arms of Krystle's ex husband, Mark (Geoffrey Scott), until Alexis cooks up one of her most delicious acts of revenge!

Sweet butler's daughter Kirby (Kathleen Beller) flies off to Reno with Jeff for an unexpected wedding, but not before she attracts the unwanted attentions of Adam, who rapes her in his apartment.  When the inevitable pregnancy arises, is it Jeff's or Adam's?  Alexis and Krystle have their famous catfight in the lily-pond, leading to Krystle's decision to move out of the Carrington mansion once and for all...

This set includes the final 12 episodes from the third season.

3496615,5,B001BN4WLS,"I loved The Dynasty series in my college years. I was glued to it and felt I knew each character personally. Later in years, I was fortunate enough to meet most of the cast in an industry setting. My only beef is how the seasons are being issued and at such a slow pace, I have not even opened any of mine yet and I own Seasons 1 through 4. I am waiting for the release of the final 5 seasons and hoping they are not split into season volumes, as some of the earlier seasons were.

3496616,1,B001BN4WLS,"As a teenager I was a huge fan of Dynasty in the second half of its 9 year run, from the mid to late '80s. However, I missed out on seeing the early seasons, and was always keen to see them, as I really used to like this show. So, after all these years, I keenly awaited the DVD releases to revisit a show I remembered fondly from over 20 years ago.
What a disappointment! The show has dated badly and was nowhere near as enjoyable as I remember it. While Season 2 had its moments, Season 3 was pretty poor. The storylines in this season became too over-the-top, sensational and hard to believe. I know the show is only a soap, and was meant to be larger than life escapism and not to be taken too seriously, but I actually found I couldn't take it seriously at all. I can go along with sensational storylines to a point, but if plots don't have some logical explanation, with some vaguely realistic reactions and dialogue from characters, and don't make some attempt to be based in the real world- even a little- then I lose interest.
The dialogue here is always dramatic and grand, and not very believable: scenes are either sentimental with characters professing their love for each other, or characters fighting, feuding and plotting. There are few in-betweens, and little mature character interaction.
The character of Adam Carrington is farcical: kidnapped at birth and raised by his kidnapper on a remote farm, he grows up to be a suave, intelligent and well-groomed lawyer who returns to the family and is accepted into it within a few episodes, with little proof of his identity (a baby's rattle!). A few episodes later, having just joined this multi-millionaire oil dynasty, he plots to murder his new brother-in-law - for little apparent reason- by painting his office with poisonous paint (the poison ends up making its victim aggressive for several episodes).
Plots are not logically worked out, they are just melodramatic and move too fast. Characters are thrown from one crisis to another, no matter how ludicrous, with each crisis being forgotten a few episodes later with no real lasting impact.
Chararacters are two dimensional, and are given little motivation for why they do the things they do: they do it either because they are ""good"" (like Krystle) or ""evil"" (like Adam.). Fallon Carrington's character is watered down this season, and has unfortunately lost its bite. The butler Joseph barely gets one dimension - he's just bland (or maybe it's just the actor playing him).
The show does have its good points, however -it must have done something right to be so popular back then. One of TV's greatest intro's and theme tunes, and John Forsythe, Linda Evans, Joan Collins and Pamela Sue Martin, who are fine actors and great to watch, and who have a good chemistry with each other. And it does have its fun moments, such as Krystle and Alexis' famous pond fight. And it also captures the greed, excess, fashion and conservativeness of the `80s well. But that's about it. If you want to watch a good `80s drama about an oil-rich feuding family, with better plots, more believable stories, and well-developed characters, buy Dallas instead.",1270771200,3,3162,4.782449725776965
3496617,3,B001BN4WLS,"Although the .... ummmm .... colorful young men who still swoon over DYNASTY tend to insist it was all ""perfect"" (except for that nasty Season 1 which was too smart and character-based and sequin-deficient to really work for them), Season 3 is where the seeds for DYNASTY's downfall were originally sewn.

Season 1, as I said, was a well-crafted drama (with a legitimate sociopolitical subtext!) although a bit too leisurely-paced, perhaps. And Krystle was still a three-dimensional character. Then, in Season 2, Joan Collins enters the picture as mysterious ex-wife Alexis living in the art studio three feet from the house, which was splashy, cleverly-conceived and well-played fun.

So imagine my shock and disappointment when Season 3 premiered and all of that was .... gone.

Suddenly, the producers had changed the tone of their burgeoning hit show, contriving a misguided, furiously-adhered-to (for six years!) static acting directive designed to make the already-poised actors seem even MORE poised (yet did the opposite) while any narrative logic in the scripts was thrown out the window, hyperbolic love/hate repartee substituting for any kind of focus or flow to the stories... At once, all the characters became equidistant from one another, knew each other equally well, spoke in interchangeable dialogue. Gone was any warranted cynicism about wealth and the wealthy, replaced with a dreadful, fawningly '80s ""rich-people-are-good/poor-people-are-horrible"" mindset. And every corner of the show is now infected.

Yes, the introduction of snarling, long-lost son Adam (well-cast with Gordon Thomson) and his vaguely incestuous relationship with mother Alexis was a good thing, and the defining storyline of the season. But even that is lessened by the fact that Alexis has been transformed overnight from the grasping and manipulative socialite she was the previous season to brilliant Empress of Industry, with no transition period shown at all. Now that she is the just-add-water Queen of the Planet, she no longer has to purr and scheme and deceive; she simply openly insults and bitches everybody out in every scene, removing the sense of intelligence and mystery she once displayed and, likewise, any sense of her enigmatic backstory. She's just a spoiled cow now. Only a cow dressed in fur.

But the biggest loss is what happens to Krystle, the golden heroine once so soulfully played by Linda Evans. Krystle had at one time provided the moral voice for this show now so contemptuous of such perspective. With the downturn in the writing in season 3, the actors' simultaneously being restrained into excessive physical rigidity, and the loss of the producers' interest in anything not reflective of Reagan's smugly mercenary value system, Krystle quickly becomes a vapid and saccharine Stepford wife and exactly the goody-goody Alexis had always (and once unjustly) accused her of. And Evans' performance suffers pointedly: her clear-eyed countenance now increasingly replaced with a cross-eyed squealing of her lines (thank goodness the new producers from Season 9 finally acknowledged this change, cleverly chalking it up to a brain injury from years before!)... Just as Vivien Leigh was born to play Scarlett O'Hara, Linda Evans and Joan Collins seemed born to play Krystle and Alexis (as Season 2 gives most vivid evidence). They were PERFECT casting. Yet as the Good Queen is neglected and trivialized in Season 3 and beyond, the Bad Queen also suffers: Alexis no longer has a valid, statured, female partner with whom to spar.

These problems continued -- and were exacerbated -- for years. All the way thru Season 8... Star appeal and middling glitz and the program's obvious potential and a formidable Spelling/ABC public relations campaign kept the show in the press and high in the ratings for a few more seasons, the poorly-resolved Moldavian Massacre early in Season 6 often cited for its eventual collapse. But this briefly-great show was REALLY killed once bleating Krystle pulled Blake off that rainy mountainside at the outset of Season 3, Blake moaning in soapy splendor, ""Krystle, I must get home!""

3496626,5,B001BN4WLS,"I really thought owning these Dynasty dvds would be anecdotal, or just something nostalgic to have as a dust collector. However, the strangest thing has happened, they have gripped me in the same riveting fashion that they did in the 80's! The steady diet of tacky Reality TV shows and teenager driven ""dramas"" in recent years really makes you appreciate the superb craftsmanship of Dyansty. Each episode reminds you that this is a skillfully engineered, over the top, melodramatic, zany, shocking, bonkers-fashion show, and a true cliffhanging super-soap. The most difficult thing was not ploppping in every single DVD one after the other! There are no characters currently on modern television with this kind of charisma and dramatically costumed physical appearances. My only chagrin is that there are no special features of which to speak of, and of course, the way the 3rd season was miserly split into two sets, sold months apart! That part sucked, but nonetheless, five stars!!!!",1227052800,3,986,5.16875
3496627,3,B001BN4WLS,"I am still put off by having the seasons broken up in two but am glad that the wait for Volume 2 wasn't interminable.  The picture quality is still excellent (much better than the faded and scratched ""Dallas"" transfers) and the episodes uncut.

Oddly, the third season of ""Dynasty"" found the show becoming a phenomenon to rival ""Dallas"" and yet I found I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons.  First of all, some of the compelling characters like Claudia and Al Corley as Steven aren't around much or at all and that's a disappointment.  Pamela Bellwood's Claudia was so great and in Volume 2 she only appears once (thankfully, Claudia does come back in Season 4.)  ""Heroes"" Jack Coleman assumes the role of Steven but seems stiff and uncomfortable connecting with his character. Other newcomers like Geoffrey Scott, Kathleen Beller and Gordon Thomson are a mixed bag.  Thomson's Adam brings the melodrama and camp up a notch but Beller's Kirby flounders in a chemistry-free relationship with Jeff and Scott, brought in as Krystle's not so ex-husband, has a storyline that loses steam as the season progresses.  I know I shouldn't compare to ""Dallas' but I did like the fact that the cast of the latter show stayed intact as long as possible. ""Dynasty"" seems to change directions every season -not that it's a bad thing and hey, the ratings told the story.

And then there's Krystle and Alexis and the lily pond.  As classic as this sequence is, I think it lacks the ferocity of the original studio battle which was the culmination of months and months of tension.  The lily pond was just an excuse to have them fight again after a brief  argument.

Does my critique mean I will be staying away from Season 4?  Heck no.  I say bring on more drama because now I'm hooked.  I just hope the wait isn't too long.",1226620800,8,1819,4.640625

And then they will stop releasing more because they will say that sales weren't good enough on Season 3 so they have decided not to release more. Well maybe it would sell more if you released the entire season. It's not like there are going to be multi-bonus features or something that requires years of preparation. It's just a straight dvd of a series that was loved world wide. And then we finally get a teaser of Dynasty with its first two seasons, wait forever, and then they try to pull this nonsense?

3496632,1,B001BN4WLS,"...rationalising that it costs money to transfer a TV show onto DVD etc., etc., etc., I don't see this happening with Dallas, a show that is about to be born again on DVD in its (full-length) tenth season! To the dissenters who tell us to stop whining...think about it!!! The splitting of seasons on DVD is outrageous and while I loved Dynasty, I for one won't get sucked into this!!!",1224028800,5,384,4.5
3496633,5,B001BN4WLS,At least the series is coming out little by little. I am a hugh fan of Dynasty and dream of owning all 9 seasons one day on dvd. I taped them on tv during the first run on vhs but those tapes are long gone and the quality on those tapes didn't last - mostly the sound went on them so I am not able to watch them anymore. I am not a fan of having to buy a split season - maybe the powers that be will learn from the sucess of the Dallas dvd sets being released season by season complete at about every 6 months or so. So far 9 seasons of Dallas are out and the 10th due in January of 09 - lets hope Dynasty will move faster and see a complete release every 6 months or so or sooner..................... Dynasty NEEDS to catch up with the Dallas dvd releases !or if worst comes to worst- release 2 vols of a season at once - I hate hanging on to see the next chapter of Dynasty.........,1223856000,3,884,3.889502762430939
3496634,5,B001BN4WLS,"Season 3 Volume 2 dvds.
Got the second volume today.

The picture quality is as good as the previous seasons. The credits are a little grainy but after that the picture is very good. Paramount have done a very good job with the remastering. The sound is crystal clear.

I've watched various scenes, and the picture is wonderful, there's so much more fine detail and texture in the costumes and set, Alexis's outfit's look particularly good.

Hope Paramount keeps up the high quality with Dynasty, just wish they would release seasons quicker.",1223596800,2,542,4.869565217391305
3496635,2,B001BN4WLS,"There are plenty of shows that release an entire season at reasonable prices. I've been collecting Dallas for $30 and under for an entire season - and they WERE the ratings CHAMP - #1 for five seasons, unlike Dynasty, which only achieved that rating for one season. The marketers are being greedy, and those who feel ripped off should not buy it so as not to encourage this sort of marketing ploy in the future. We can live without the third season of Dynasty - life will go on. If we don't draw the line somewhere, we'll be forever taken to the cleaners.",1221955200,10,555,4.398058252427185
3496636,5,B001BN4WLS,Please hurry with season 4-9.  This is taking too long to be put on DVD.  Dallas series is already on its 9th season out.  Come on Dynasty fans and lets get the ball rolling!  We need more of this 80's drama on dvd quick!!!,1221609600,11,223,4.0
3496637,5,B001BN4WLS,"I'm just as upset as everyone else that Season 3 has been split into two volumes. However, I am also happy that Dynasty is finally being released. A boycott means lack of sales, which means we won't see future seasons released. If you are upset, please write Paramount (in a civilized manner)that you support and are happy that they are releasing Dynasty, but are disappointed that seasons are being split in two.

I'm betting that since this is only the second season from Paramount, they are still testing the waters on how each season should be released. If they know enough people support Dynasty, they may revert back to full season releases.",1220140800,4,647,4.776785714285714
3496638,5,B001BN4WLS,"I really don't care what price they put on each series but I do think most people/fans would like to have each season in its entirety. Die hard fans would easily sit down & watch an entire season over a weekend once they've brought it home from the shop. If you have a ""set"" that ends mid season!? well...thats not the way it was meant to be watched! Charge what you need to charge to make you profit but PLEASE put each season out in ONE box set! The manufacturers should try ""channeling"" Krystle more & not Alexis! Be good! Not evil!",1219881600,18,535,4.254901960784314

3496640,1,B001BN4WLS,if i could wait 16 years since the show ended till the first season released in 2005-then i can wait untill the whole show released in one package with complete seasons and reasonable price.,1219190400,6,190,4.617647058823529
3496641,5,B001BN4WLS,"I don't care how they release them, just do it.  I do not mind paying a little more if the rest of the seasons come out.  Season 4 is were the series really hit its stride and became an international phenomenom.

Keep releasing and I will keep buying!

Dynasty is a great guilty pleasure!",1219017600,13,288,4.277777777777778
