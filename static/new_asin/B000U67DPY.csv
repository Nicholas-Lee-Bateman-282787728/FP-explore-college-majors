8212137,3,B000U67DPY,"1) This film has poor acting, by washed up actors and actresses, lets face it.
2) The storyline is boring and typical, completely unoriginal.....go figure.
3) Purchased this to see my crush who stars in it (not going to say her name) but her acting was very poor in it as well.

The Movie is okay if you just want something to watch and not really get into, something to pass the time sort of thing where you don't care if you miss 5 or 10 minutes of it because your mind wanders.",1396656000,,480,4.161290322580645
8212138,3,B000U67DPY,"The title of the film refers to two couples who are polar opposites. Jula Diva (Erika Amato) lives off of a trust fund and is in a band. She is pretentious and a liar. Rhonda (Shonda Farr) is her down to earth roommate who uses Jula's equipment to make documentary films which Jula insists includes her.

Our male couple consists of Scott (Joe Peracchio) A down to eath rich guy who aspires to be a writer. He lives off an allowance. His roommate is the good looking gigolo waiter Micah (David Lago) who is a sponge and like Jula is a pretentious liar.

The couples hook up with expected consequences. The one sided characters also include Skipper (K.W. Miller) Scott's despicable brother who enjoys raping the masses. All the characters are one sided and half developed, which seems to be intentional. It has mixed results.

The film is sold as a comedy, yet lacked any good funny moments. It also failed in being a dark comedy. As best as I can figure, it is an independent film for pretentious people who like independent films. You know who you are, so go watch it.

  Next time, ""Keep It Realistical !"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flourish/dp/B000JLTSH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flourish</a>",1294012800,,521,5.653846153846154
8212140,5,B000U67DPY,"I LOVE this movie. It is SO typical of the industry, and Erika Amato as Jula Diva was amazing. At times you hated Jula for her being so unaware of peoples needs besides her own, and at others you felt so sad for her because she want to be in love so badly.
Erika Amato hit that role, spot on.
I totally disagree with what one reviewer said about problems believing that the the two guys were brothers.
My own brother is so totally different from me, that most people don't believe we are brothers......pretty normal I think. Amazing movie.
I hope we see much, MUCH more of Ms. Amato.
And.....more singing!",1192752000,,605,4.410714285714286
8212141,5,B000U67DPY,"This is a charming indie movie with wonderful performances by the actors and some great music from Velvet Chain (a band of whom I am rather a large fan - so there's a little bias, there).  Erika Amato is hilarious and moving as aspiring rock goddess ""Jula Diva,"" Shonda Farr gives a lovely, understated performance as a budding filmmaker, Joseph Peracchio is very believable as the young man torn between his dreams and his family obligations, and David Lago is just a hoot as wannabe superstar, ""Micah.""  (""Just one name.  Like Cher."")  Oh, and Allison Munn is a riot as ""Tequila!""

I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for something a bit off the beaten path!",1192665600,2,668,4.627118644067797
8212142,4,B000U67DPY,"I loved it! Really, really cute. Erika Amato is terrific as the wild and wacky Jula and my second favorite was Allison Munn's 'Tequila'. She was hysterical.

I only had 2 small problems with it. First, I just had a hard time believing that Scott and Skipper were really brothers.  They were just as different as night and day.  Second -  There wasn't enough music in it. I thought with the subject matter (and the cast) there would be a lot more. Erika's singing at the beginning certainly made me wish for more.  But all in all I really loved it and I'm delighted that I bought the DVD. I'll be watching this one more than once!
