I'm 22 and I laughed just as hard as my 50 year old mother. I loved it when I was a kid and I still do. Eddie Murphy makes it very funny but the kids really sell it too. Like other reviewers I appreciated the history behind this movie with the ride at Walt Disney World and it was very cool to see the x-ray of the movie to learn the fun trivia as the movie went along. I only rented it because I don't plan to watch it several times a year, but I ended up watching it twice over the course of the rental period which was three days. It was worth the $3 for the SD rental.",1505606400,,735,3.8741721854304636

1983108,3,B0001A79G2,"Pros: funny, a delight for fans of the Haunted Mansion attraction especially.

Cons: It's not the best or the funniest film from Disney or Murphy

If you know me, then it's no secret that I am a big fan of most things Disney, especially the theme parks. So it would probably be no surprise that I was sort of excited to see this film based on my favorite Disney World attraction of the same name. Of course I was a bit skeptical; I mean this was a movie based on a theme park ride after all.

The Plot

Louisiana real estate team of Evers and Evers is made up of husband and wife Jim and Sara Evers. One day, Sara was contacted by telephone from the Gracey Mansion to come to their property for a consultation and evaluation for sale. Little did she realize that the call was made by Master Gracey's butler Ramsley, who is a ghost.

The mansion still stands after 100 or more years despite the fact that no living occupants have been there for so long. The mansion is haunted by owner, Master Gracey, his servants and 995 other ghosts who are cursed to the property since a masquerade ball in the 1900s. Back on this night, Master Gracey asked the love of his life, Elizabeth, for her hand in marriage. The night ended horribly with an apparent suicide by Elizabeth, and then by the master himself. This somehow cursed all the guests to die and be cursed to the spacious manor for all eternity.

Sara was contacted because she is believed to be the reincarnation of Elizabeth, who she looks exactly alike. If she would marry Master Gracey, then the curse would be broken and the ghosts would be able to move on into the afterlife that awaits them in Heaven.

The whole Evers crew (Jim, Sara, their son Michael & daughter Megan) drives down to the mansion on their way out of town for a weekend together. They are forced to stay the night in the mansion due to a torrential rain storm which floods the road. One by one, the family slowly becomes aware that the mansion is haunted. Jim Evers meets Madam Leota, who is the ghostly head of a gypsy woman stuck in her own crystal ball. She sends him on two scary adventures in order to break the curse of Gracey Manor and save his wife from sure death.

Analysis

It turns out that at the same time that this movie was being planned; Eddie Murphy (Jim Evers) was planning his own comedy about a haunted house. This is how he got involved in this Disney project, and it turns out that it is a good thing he did because the movie does have many laughs due to Murphy's comedy style.

Eddie Murphy's scenes with Madame Leota are very funny, especially the one where the two meet for the first time. He refers to her as the ""crazy green gypsy in the giant paperweight"". As the movie must emulate the Disneyland attraction, there is a wealth of material available to choose from. The whole graveyard scene with ghosts that will seem familiar to those who have visited the Haunted Mansion attraction are here, including the hitchhiking ghosts and the ""singing busts"" who steal the scene with their need to sing barbershop harmonies together.

The ride itself is probably OK for children five or six-years-old and up, and the film is probably OK for those same ages. Eddie Murphy says ass twice in the film, and that is the extent of the vulgarity, and by today's standards it's pretty lame, although those two words and some scary(ish) scenes earned the movie a PG rating.

The movie is a simple adventure that incorporates life and death, and even tackles the afterlife briefly of Heaven and Hell. You may hear a few people that claim to have seen it and didn't like it. But really, what's not to like? It's an Eddie Murphy adventure that deals with ghosts - it's a formula that sounds like it would be hilarious. It does work, because it is funny. It's not the funniest movie by Murphy, or the best live-action film by Disney - but it will entertain you for sure, in fact bring the whole family.",1503014400,,3935,4.44244105409154
1983109,5,B0001A79G2,I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid. I forgot how great it is! My 9 and 11 year olds love it now too. Eddie Murphy does an amazing job once again!,1501545600,,154,3.5588235294117645

Other reviewers seem to have purchased it as a way of reliving their experiences on the Haunted Mansion ride - which I've been on - and I just don't know what they are talking about as being at all similar.  Murphy's character is a dolt.  There is not an iota of substance to the script - ghosts have more substance.  As is increasingly the case with Disney films, the use of vulgar language and innuendo is about on par with the film itself.  Not funny.  Vulgar.  Hauntingly poor.",1496793600,,524,4.442105263157894

It's funny for all ages and has enough suspense to keep older family members interested without being to frightening for children (my at the time 5 year old watched it along with my 10 and 11 year old and was not scared and loved it).  There is a scene towards the end where they go into a crypt and the skeletons come alive and attack.  My then 5 year old said he didn't like that part but he didn't think it was too scary just a little bit.  The rest of the movie is filled with interesting characters, an interesting (but somewhat predictable) story line, and a lot of fun adventure.  My kids personal favorite are the singing heads.",1487980800,,688,4.34375

The family meet a creepy butler and owner and the story begins. Supernatutal events follow and we get a story. My kid (4) loved it. He loves Halloween (even more then Christmas I think). The special effect are ok. Remember it was 2003. Yes movies have been done better year before Haunted Mansion and yes Haunted Mansion was done by Disney for something like 90Million, but it was still a good movie for the family.

1983188,3,B0001A79G2,My favorite ride at Disneyland will always be The Haunted Mansion. First time I ever went to Disneyland was when I was five and I remember being so terrified yet so enchanted with The Haunted Mansion that I loved it ever since. When this movie was announced to be made I was so excited. I remember waiting for it to come out in theaters because just had to see the movie based on my favorite ride.  I can't say that this movie did it justice though. I hated how cheesy Eddie Murphy made it seem. Loved the graphics and how beautifully haunted the house looked. Jennifer Tilly was amazing has Madame Leota and the Hitchhiking ghost were great as well. But the movie itself was just ok.,1475366400,,684,4.3858267716535435

1983264,3,B0001A79G2,"Not a terrible movie, which is part of its problem.  There really needs to be a word for movies you wish were worse than they are.  ""Schadenfilm"" perhaps?  This movie is bad enough to not be worth watching, but not terrible enough to be laughable, or 'Rifftrax' fodder.  It's just a somewhat dull kids film stuffed with admittedly decent special effects.  It's only real crime is how incredibly long it takes to get to any hauntings or laughs (29 minutes).  Everything up to that more or less revolves around the work and family life of real estate agents.

It would've been 2 stars if it were not for decent performances from most of the cast.  Again, it's not a 'bad' movie, it's just not a good one either.  For kids and hardcore Disney Haunted Mansion fans, just skip the first 35 minutes or so and start from there.",1450224000,,820,4.486486486486487

It's completely PG so it's great for kids (totally corny) but Eddie Murphy is always a delight to watch. Also, they do a really good job of tying the Disney ride details into it (barbershop quartet, gypsy seer, etc.) and the house is extraordinary -- tons of rooms with lots of details. Definitely a cool unique story that represents the best of 90s-00s millennial movies.",1445126400,,632,4.495652173913044

1983348,4,B0001A79G2,"This film got generally bad reviews with the consensus being that it is ""neither funny nor scary."" Well keep in mind this movie is made for families so I think it's the perfect balance of funny and scary for that medium. There are definitely funny parts and at least one pretty scary scene for kids ( that involves a skeleton). Apparently a lot of die hard fans of the ride thought it didn't live up to their standards but I'm a fan and thought the movie was pretty good.

I'm guessing a lot of people reading the reviews on here have seen the movie already and are looking into buying the DVD and seeing what it has to offer, so no need to go into detail about the actual movie. These are the special features of the DVD, hope this is helpful in deciding whether or not to buy it... Bonus Features: The Haunted Mansion - Secrets Revealed, Anatomy of a Scene: Ghosts in the Graveyard, Disney's DVD Virtual Ride of the Haunted Mansion, Deleted Scene: Emma and Ezra, Outtakes Reel, ""Superstition"" Music Video, Audio Commentaries, Enhanced Computer Features. It also says it has DVD-Rom content: History of the attraction, wallpaper/screensavers, photo galleries, enhanced virtual tour and something where you can morph your photo into a ghost.",1434153600,,1241,4.71889400921659

There's no potty humor, burp/fart jokes and etc., no CGI talking animals, and no pointless musical numbers with the cast singing/dancing. The kids have been enjoying this film of late and the more I watch it the better it gets. On the whole, the Haunted Mansion film isn't a masterpiece to take your breath away, nor is it an especially remarkable film. It is, though, an above-average family film that is well crafted.",1430870400,,535,4.8901098901098905

1983380,4,B0001A79G2,"(Review from customer : Mohd. Shazlan Sezli)

Thank you Theme Parkology for making this wonderful title. The history, interviews and information on the characters are everything I had hope for. Pure excellent and I applaud the effort.

I could have given it 5 stars, but the ride-through segment is really a let-down.  I not fussy, I know its impossible to get absolute clarity on any handheld especially inside the dark rides but Ive seen better qualities on Youtube. The visual quality could have been better and sometimes the camera zooms-in too much that its hard to make out the targeted objects. The HM ride-through posted on Youtube scores on these counts and even has night-vision so we aren't missing out on the dark areas. That aside, bravo! Im so proud to put this among my Walt Disney collection. If you (Theme Parkology) will ever produce a special edition of this title just by improving the ride-through, Ill definitely purchase again. So far none has commented on this and I understand why. These viewers can visit Disneyland every year but me.. I live on the other side of the world and the nearest Hong Kong Disneyland has Mystic Manor, a Chinese rendition of HM but not quite the same.

Fox World Theme Park will be opening soon in my country so I don't think Ill be visiting Disneyland or WDW anytime soon but HM will always be my sweet childhood memory. For that, a big Thank you!",1422144000,,1401,4.682926829268292

1983492,3,B0001A79G2,"Haunted Mansion's problem is that it is 2 movies in one and the result is that it succeeds in being an amusing, fun little Eddie/Disney effort and not much more. It starts out being a typical Eddie vehicle: he is a harried real estate salesman with a BEAUTIFUL wife, 2 moppets, a 7 series BMW and they all end up in a spooky old house in rural Louisiana. The first half of the movie is a predictable but fun romp thru the haunted house. Then it takes a darker turn, with issues of murder, miscegenation, lost love and an attempt at body and soul snatching that just doesn't fit with the rest of the film. Most kids will love the first part and then become confused by the second part. The mansion itself is wonderfully done by Disney's Imagineers, the ghosts are believable and well acted, and Eddie is, well Eddie. The only part that may be too scary for little ones is the mausoleum scene, the rest is comedic more than frightening. Overall it does NOT deserve a 13% rating from Rotten Tomatoes: it is a fun little semi-scary movie that is for the whole family and would be a perfect Halloween or Scary Movie Night feature and for the low low price of $12 on Blu ray how can you go wrong? Could have been better if they had stuck with the initial light-hearted nature of the beginning, but still in all an enjoyable movie for family entertainment.",1382227200,,1349,4.4

1983514,5,B0001A79G2,"I know this movie is not Oscar material by any means and was panned by the critics, but I personally love this movie.  The Haunted Mansion tells the story of Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) who has become a workaholic.  Jim just can't say ""no"" to a customer interested in buying their dream home.  But his commitment to the customer is beginning to cause him to lose sight of what he loves the most: his wife, and business partner Sara,(British-born Marsha Thomason) and children Megan and Michael.  Jim lands in hot water when he misses taking Sara out to dinner for their anniversary.  To make it up to his family he promises to take them to the lake for a much-needed family vacation.  But as always, work gets in the way.  Jim and his family soon find themselves at the Gracey Mansion for a night of adventure they'll never forget.

Now, here's what I think of the movie.  I think the movie is entertaining and fun.  The actors all do a good job especially Marsha Thomason and Nathaniel Parker who plays Master Gracey.  Marsha Thomason is stunningly beautiful and brings sophistication and charm to the role.  And the ruggedly-handsome Nathaniel Parker has such a presence on screen and brings a brooding quality to the role.  The role of Jim Evers is nice change from what Eddie Murphy usually does.  Although I have to admit many of his lines seemed kind of cheesy and predictable.  With that said, don't be mislead by all the negative reviews you have read, or will read; because Disney's The Haunted Mansion is an engaging movie the whole family will enjoy.",1376006400,,1558,4.635036496350365

1983519,2,B0001A79G2,"The Haunted Mansion should be fun enough for children, but certainly not anything that spectacular that would leave them breathless. The problem I see here is that you would expect something absolutely refreshing and new when your talking about a movie inspired by such a central and classic ride as that of the Haunted mansion. Unfortunately the result seems very familiar and in fact some of the dialogue and gags are borrowed from other films. Eddie Murphy does all he can with a rather elementary and dull script. The child actors that play his children are not very good actors or it could be the fault of the director. The whole thing is kind of fun to see but it unfolds rather poorly and we find it rather hard to swallow how casually the children settle into this world of ghosts and goblins. There is a little fear for less than 10 seconds, then they suddenly get adventurous. I think this movie has enough thrills to satisfy little children and pre-teens, but for the rest of us it will seem rather cheesy and shallow.",1371772800,,1029,4.5978260869565215

You can never see his figure when you are standing in the portrait room, even though the flashing lightning attempts to illuminate it, but you can finally see an actual photo of it here.  And you even learn that one of the portraits in the portrait gallery is of this same corpse of Master Gracey.  This DVD was very informative about the makings and beginnings of the ride and shares secrets that I wasn't aware of.  And it lets you go on the complete ride through the mansion as well.  It's great to have a DVD devoted entirely to the Haunted Mansion, because most DVD's of the Disney parks seem to skip over this attraction.

When the Evers family arrived to the Mansion, the residents only consist of Master Edward Gracey(Nathaniel Parker), his butler Ramsley(Terrence Stamp)and Ramsley's servants Ezra(Wallace Shawn)and Emma(Dina Waters). Jim later suspects that Sara is in trouble and is confronted by Ramsley, who reveals to Jim that he, Master Gracey, and Ezra and Emma are ghosts and the Mansion is haunted and Sara is the key to end their curse.

1983599,3,B0001A79G2,"The Haunted Mansion stars the always funny Eddie Murphy as a real estate agent.  When his family is brought to a haunted mansion in an attempt to make a deal happen, the family soon finds they're trapped inside.  This is most certainly a haunted house-type movie for kids.  That's why there's an element of comedy (of course, that's to be expected with Eddie Murphy) and the jokes themselves are always simple and obvious.  The storyline is pretty straight forward as well so an adult such as myself wouldn't find much in the way of interest.  I was watching it for Eddie Murphy's appearance and to see how far they'd take a haunted theme.  Not very far I soon realize.

However Terence Stamp always plays SUCH a remarkably convincing bad guy that his appearance alone is pretty awesome.  His serious ghostly character combined with Eddie Murphy's unusual whacky character results in most of the humorous moments.  In fact the two of them on screen together are the high points of this adventure movie.

One unique thing about a Haunted Mansion is that the special effects are sort of cool in a Harry Potter-type way.  Heads moving inside the pictures hanging on the wall, the REALLY strange part with the statue heads singing perfectly enjoyable harmonies together, the blue-tinted ghosts that wander through the graveyard, the musical instruments that fly through the hallways and go after Eddie Murphy... these are really nice additions.  Oh and Eddie's wife is super hot, don't you think?  Yes!

For the most part, they simply ignored all aspects of the ride and made up a dopey story about a lost love and a stupid curse that never felt like a curse, then they slapped the trademark name on it, hoping that would do.  Well, it didn't do at all.  What we were mistreated to was a silly story that doesn't involve much thought, a smattering of ghosts, and a few zombies.  Eddie Murphy was definitely on autopilot but at least he registered, not so Marsha Thomason as his forgettable wife (the same holds true for Dina Waters as a ghost maid, neither made much of an impact).  Not that anyone could stand a chance going up against Terence Stamp (who seemed to think he was doing something Shakespearian).  Wallace Shawn and Jennifer Tilly relied solely on the force of their odd voices.  The children were cute.  Poor Nathaniel Parker looked as if he'd rather be doing something on Masterpiece Theatre.

It is up to her husband, Jim Evers played by Eddie Murphy, to save his family from the ghostly plans that have been hatched against them.

1983617,3,B0001A79G2,"When I first saw the previews for this movie I was really excited.  Disney did an outstanding job on ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" movie that was created/based on the Disney ride.  When Disney started promoting this and I saw it had Eddie Murphy in it I thought hmmm...interesting because I enjoyed Eddie Murphy's performance in ""Vampire In Brooklyn"".  Unfortuantely, the plot as well as Murphy's performance left me disappointed.  Maybe I had high hopes and standards for this movie to be truely ""spooky and scary"", however, that was not the case.  Murphy's comic routines in this movie are quite long and his style of humor was not good in this.  He acts like a jerk in this movie and that is a disappointment.  The rest of the actors are good especially Terrance Stamp as the main butler.  The plot at first is interesting, however towards the end it becomes quite unbelieveable and long.  That is ashame because this movie has the potential to be much more than it is or was.  Hopefully, Disney can do another remake of this movie and find the right lead actor and a good plot that compliments this great attraction at the Disney Parks.

1983620,4,B0001A79G2,"The Haunted Mansion makes for a decent, engaging Halloween watch. Eddie Murphy plays real estate agent Jim Evers, who is so bent on clinching deals and making money that he neglects his wife Sara (Marsha Thomason), and his two kids, Michael and Megan. When Sara puts her foot down one day, Jim agrees to a family weekend at the lake, but along the way he stops at a dilapidated mansion on the bayou, convincing the family that he is only going to be awhile and speak to the owner about a listing.

Well, it turns out that the mansion is haunted by inhabitants long dead, back to the days when it was a grand old house on the sprawling bayou, owned by Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker, more familiar to fans of British crime dramas as Inspector Lynley in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Inspector-Lynley-Mysteries/dp/B001D7T6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries</a>). Gracey is now long dead but continues to inhabit the mansion as a ghost, as does his butler, Ramsley (Terence Stamp in a devilishly wicked role). The pair are convinced that Sara is the reincarnation of Gracey's long-lost love Elizabeth, who apparently committed suicide long ago.

Jim and his two children quickly find out that they need to race against time to solve the mystery of Elizabeth's death and set things right before Sara is lost to them forever. They are helped along by a disembodied head in a crystal ball (Meg Tilly), and the ghosts of a chambermaid and her husband.

The effects are pretty good and kept my daughter and I engaged. This is fun Halloween entertainment for the entire family, though I think children ages 6-10 might appreciate it more than older teens.",1319932800,,1739,5.181494661921708

But Johnny Depp is prolific and can act well in a sinister role. Eddie Murphy has bombed in some of his comedies (like that hideously stupid Norbit movie), and he doesn't always do a good job with kiddie humor. He failed in Haunted Mansion because nothing he said was surprising. My other reasons for hating this film are personal, I guess. Having ridden most Disney attractions dozens of times, I applauded the Pirates movie for being loyal to the storyline you'd expect in such a setting. I expected a movie based on my beloved Mansion ride to be creepy and campy, not spoiled with stupid modern-day language like ""getting jiggy"" just so kids would lap it up. What about all of us Disneyland fans old enough to fondly reminisce? Other reviewers felt it was a bad decision to bring the setting into the twentieth century, and I agree. And a black family was jarringly out of place. I don't care what people say; this antebellum mansion should have had eccentric Southern aristocratic types living in it. Even if this movie had come out when I was a little kid, I would have been sorely disappointed by the lack of loyalty to the ride.

1983633,5,B0001A79G2,"Allow me to start by advising you to read all the reviews.  All five start ratings are well represented, so don't base your opinion on mine alone.  Of course, mine is the correct one (LOL), but it would be interesting to see other perspectives.

""The Haunted Mansion"" came out the same year as the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.  ""Pirates"" is now a trilogy, while this one has no sequel.  Not knowing or caring how it did at the box office, I will just say that the way this movie was made would make it hard for there to be a sequel that would be worth watching.  For example, ""Pirates"" was loosely based on the theme park ride, leaving more latitude to expand.  ""Haunted Mansion"" was very faithful to the theme park ride, leaving little to incorporate in later movies.

Aside of the theme park connection, there is little similarity between the movies.  ""Pirates"" is an adventure, and this is a comedy.  If you didn't realize that before, consider that Eddy Murphy is the star.  It does have some suspense in it, but it is a comedy.  I find the ending to be funny as well.

It is hard to conceive of both ""this movie is suitable to your family"" and ""Eddy Murphy is the star"" being true, but this is the case here.  As I always say, I feel parents should always accompany their children to a movie, even if it starred Barney the dinosaur (maybe especially).  If your children can handle some scary scenes, I have no problem.  There are some story lines in the movie that are more adult, but they are subtle and the children will be lost in the story.

Let me compare this with the Addams family movies by saying there isn't much a comparison.  Both mix horror and humor, but the Addams family movies were horror movies with humorous elements with the Mansion is a comedy with a ghost story setting.  The Addams family movies were darker, and Addams Family Values left a bad taste in my mouth; this is as cheery as a ghost comedy can be.  A better comparison for ""the Haunted Mansion"" would be ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.""

As I said, consult other reviews.  But I found this movie to be enjoyable.",1234569600,,2119,4.463541666666667

But amidst the scary scenes in the graveyard and in the mansion and the ominous presence of the butler, Ramsley (Terrence Stamp), there are also barrel full of laughs scenes that show a barbershop quartet of statue heads singing during the middle of the film and at the end where the Evers family drive into the sunrise as well as the appearance of the ghost couple, Emma (Dina Walters) and Ezra (Wallace Shawn).

And how much make-up does he need?  It's like watching a synthetic robot.  ""Haunted Mansion"" attempts to be funny, I think I laughed twice.  I wish they would have totally went a different direction with the plot.  Drop Eddie Murphy and his entire family (in my oppinion he was miscast) and focus more on the haunted mansion.  The special effects were the most fun parts of the movie, anything would have been better than watching Eddie Murphy interact with his fake family.

This might be fun for little kids, but in the eyes of an adult this is an insult to the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disney World. Why? Because the story is awful and Eddie Murphy is tedious. It's almost painful to sit through this thing.

The thing is, this could have been an absolutely wonderful family film, a modern classic. But they went a different route, big time.
Don't misunderstand: the sets and effects are fine. It's just that the film tries so hard to be cool and funny that it trips over itself, ruining any chance of success. It feels like you're watching one of those mindless, saccharin Disney Channel movies with dumb jokes and a heavy moral crammed down your throat.

It wasn't everything I had hoped for but its still worth a see and a rent/buy.

I like Eddie Murphy a lot and this was a movie where he could really shine as Jim Evers, the workaholic dad.

The special effects on this film are amazing,the Zombies really had me scared and I don't think that they could have looked much better. The work on madame Leota is amazing.

THE RIDE

The Haunted Mansion was one of those rides that as a kid I would always want to go on but somewhere in the line I would regret it and get out of the line terrified of what would happen if I would go through the front doors.  But one day I did and it quickly became one of my favorite rides.

The filmakers were able to take a lot of the ride and put it on the screen

-Madame Leota has a major part, and the sance room is a cross between the ride scene and a gypsy tent

-The singing busts appear, singing a verse from Grim Grinning Ghosts

-The Portrait Gallery is an almost exact replica of the one in the ride, although the portraits are somewhat different from the ride

-The ghost duellists from the ballroom scene

-Jim has to battle suits of armor in the film. This is a reference to the moving suit of armor in the rides

-The Hitchhiking Ghosts make an appearance

This film isn't perfect but for people who don't want to fly to California to see the real Haunted Mansion this about as close as you can get.",1175385600,,1644,4.141955835962145
1983646,5,B0001A79G2,"I really enjoyed this movie, as did the rest of my family. What appealed to me the most was the set design and costumes. Being huge fans of Halloween, we decorate extensively for the holiday and this movie is a great source of inspiration. Most importantly, it's just good family fun and a full-length Halloween themed movie the entire family can watch in contrast to all the slasher films popular that time of year that even I can't handle.  The script really does a good job of including as much of the features of the Disney attraction in the storyline: The fortune-teller in the crystal ball, the singing busts, etc.

It's a little scary for littlest ones, but my kids could handle it OK and they first saw it at ages 1, 2 and 5!  They are now 4, 5 and 8, and it continues to be a Halloween-time favorite.  I should say, though, they've also seen all the Harry Potter films and both Pirates of the Carribean and weren't afraid of them...so if you've seen these films then you can gauge from them how your child will handle Haunted Mansion. Every parent knows their kids the best and can determine for themselves when their kids should see it.

I think those reviewers who gave it a low rating were unfairly expecting too much from it.  Not every movie has to be Academy-award winning material to be enjoyable.  This movie sets out to entertain families and it does just that.",1166227200,,1379,4.492

Other than that, any hint of the tale that lingers in the walls of the Haunted Mansion attic do not exist, or explain any justified story that might have been told to cause the hauntings to begin with, they are merely the end result of a demented curse upon the mansion. The Haunted Mansion ride really needed no explanation, and it was best to leave it to the spectator to make his or her own story to accompany the goings on there, and this movie only brings to light, that the ride is so much better for it all.

They serve as cinematic ""easter eggs"" that will appeal to anyone who's been to the ride. Yes, the story line is obvious within about the first fifteen minutes of the movie; but following that predictable path is never dull. Eddie Murphy's bravado, fading and rising with, first the realization that something is very wrong at the Gracie Manor, and then with the understanding that his family is threatened takes the audience along with him on this fun-house ride.

Supporting roles are, for the most part, predictable with the exception of the chilling performance of Terence Stamp and the surprise ending that unlocks ""the curse!""

For very young children, be advised that there are some really scary special effects, courtesy of the current King of Scream, Rick Baker, but nothing that will leave mental or emotional scars and even my seven-year-old giggled her way through most of the movie.

Without a doubt, it is one of Disney's greatest achievements, and a ride I could go on again and again and never get tired of! My other favorite at Disneyland is Pirates Of The Caribbean, so the fact that Disney made movies based on my 2 favorite attractions shows what I've known all along-they are the best of the best! The film versions of Pirates Of The Caribbean are brilliant, they are some of my favorite Disney films. The film version of The Haunted Mansion is...well, not as good. That's not to say this movie is bad; it is, in fact, quite well done! The references to the attraction throughout the film are awesome and cleverly done, I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers were big fans of the ride as well. It has several humorous moments too, and the makeup and special effects work is simply amazing! It's a good movie overall, but it could've been better.

The artistic design and special effects are, for the most part, a genuine tribute to the magic of the ride. But, whereas elements of the ""Pirates"" ride were implemented into the plotline of its movie with seamless credibility, references to the ghostly attraction in this movie were somewhat gratuitous.

Add to that an endless parade of low-brow humor, poor writing and cheesy acting, and you have really ticked me off, Disney.

There are two competing stories in this:  The story of Eddie Murphy's family, in which he and his wife are real estate agents and he has trouble stopping work long enough to spend time with his family.  The second has to do with the history of New Orleans, tragedy, romance, and the supernatural.  Which sounds more interesting?

The story that Disney chose to work with for this was very bland and could have been used for another venue.  They had a fantastic set up and wasted the opportunity to do yet another story that few can relate to.  (Unless you happen to know a lot of people in high paying jobs whose only problems are forcing themselves to spend more time with their loved ones.)

Of course it isn't a classic by far. The film was scripted by David Berenbaum to what I guess was his best, I feel the film could have used a much better script. But of couse that can't rely solely on the writer to make this film good. Producers Don Hahn, and Andrew Gunn could have lent a hand at making it all it can be, of course it's not fair to lay it all on them either. The directer is suppossed to bring every thing to the big screen, that role fell apon Rob Minkoff. It seems that this film could have used a little more push on his part. This is apaint since the falt of this film was definintly not the special effects, Sony Pictures did a great job in that department. Now don't get me wrong I think all the stated above did good jobs, I just think it could have been better.

As far as acting goes Eddie Murphy does what he can with the script, in fact it is his timing and facial exprestions that make the film good, and as far as supporting roles go, everybody at the house does n excellent job. It is his family members that I think fell a little below in that department.

The haunted mansion looks good though, the place has potential - and perhaps that is what makes the movie watchable.

Eddie Murphy has never tried to cover up for making some of his later movies only for the profit, his heart isn't in it anymore it seems. The best ""resent"" movies are Nutty Professor 1 & 2 in my opinion, other than that (and Shrek 1 & 2 of course) he has wasted a lot of his talent making B-movies far below his league, a shame really.

1983672,2,B0001A79G2,"It seemed a clever idea for Disney to turn its non-film-based attractions into movies. While the Country Bear Jamboree was a dud, Pirates of the Caribbean was a delight. Like the film that materialized from the former, The Haunted Mansion is a meagre fantasy that will undoubtedly be forgotten and turn to dust.
Eddie Murphy plays real estate agent Jim Evers, who neglects his familial duties to close deals. During a family outing with his wife Sara (Marsha Thomason), timid son, and no-nonsense daughter, Evers stops to have a look at a ""historical sprawling manor with spacious grounds"" that he hopes to represent. When it begins to rain, they are invited to spend the night by its owner Gracey (Nathaniel Parker) and manservant Ramsley (Terence Stamp). It comes as no surprise that the occupants turn out to be ghosts, and even a headless corpse can figure out that Sara was lured to the mansion because she resembles Gracey's lost love.
In keeping with the ride at Disneyland/world, The Haunted Mansion is not intended to be scary but more like a fun-house, and includes familiar images from the attraction such as singing busts, waltzing apparitions, and the crystal ball-encapsulated gypsy seer (Meg Tilly). Directed by Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little), the story is slow to evolve and lacks tension or surprise. Most of this is due to a predictable script that doesn't offer a single original plot development. And the film can hardly be considered a comedy because there's nothing funny; even the line ""I see dead people"" falls flat, when delivered matter-of-factly by the smug son.
Although the art direction is superb, the audience barely gets to see the eerie Louisiana bayou, elaborate interiors, and shimmering ghosts. Instead, we are treated to the stares of bug-eyed Murphy and expressionless Stamp. Being in purgatory would be far more entertaining. Rating: 4 out of 10.",1104451200,,1882,5.035256410256411

1983674,1,B0001A79G2,"Remember this movie people...For it marks the final nail in the coffin of Eddie Murphy's once proud career. A career which saw him fall from the heights of Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop to the lowly depths of the done-to-death workaholic father, Jim Evers.

I can honestly say without a hint of exaggeration that this is by a sizable margin, the worst film I have ever seen in my life.

The fact that this drivel was aimed at children is of no consequence, it should never have been allowed to come into existence. I can only imagine what mind bending drugs Eddy Murphy was on when he decided it would be a positive career move to appear in this poorly written, poorly directed, poorly performed cheese-fest.

The words clich, predictable & tiresome don't even begin to describe my thoughts as I shook my head again and again at the droll that was being thrust into my brain.

Throughout the rather originally titled 'Haunted Mansion' I was quite frankly embarrassed to have sat witness to a storyline and character base so mind numbingly tragic.

It is evident that Director Rob Minkoff felt that once he had gotten Eddy Murphy to sign on the dotted line, all he had to do was churn out more tried and tested Hollywood pap and wait for payday.

Let me summarise: Workaholic and his kids arrive at a haunted house, surprisingly, some ""scary"" stuff happens and then everybody learns a valuable lesson... oh, and at the risk of spoiling the intricately woven plot... the Butler did it.

Everybody involved in this movie should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves... and I mean everybody.",1097107200,,1587,4.707581227436823

1983676,2,B0001A79G2,"""The Haunted Mansion,"" a film ""inspired"" by the Disney theme-park attraction of the same name, feels like a cross between ""The Haunting"" and ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.""  Eddie Murphy is a real estate agent working in tandem with his wife, Marsha Thomason.  One day she receives a call from a mysterious stranger asking her to check out some property he wants to put up for sale.  Even though the caller specifically asks that she come alone, Murphy decides to go along with her, bringing their two young children as well.  When they arrive on the scene, the family finds a mansion replete with all the paraphernalia common to a conventional haunted house - sliding panels, hidden passageways, a graveyard in the backyard, an eccentric owner, a creepy butler (played with delicious relish by Terence Stamp) and, of course, a houseful of unruly and unsettled resident ghosts.  Once ensconced inside, the family discovers - much like homeowners in a buyer's market - that it's always easier to get into a haunted house than it is to get out of one.

Murphy assumes the Bob Hope role of the comical skeptic who meets each and every danger with a defiant wisecrack and clever quip.  Unfortunately, even Murphy, for all his talent, can't rescue material that doesn't have anything much there to begin with.  The story is predictable and silly and the dialogue woefully bereft of laughs.  There's also one glaring plot hole that should not go unremarked upon.  Thomason is supposed to be a (pardon the pun) dead-ringer for a woman who killed herself a hundred and fifty years ago, yet there is no way that, in the context of that time, that woman could ever possibly have been black.  Colorblindness is generally a good thing, but in this instance, it strikes at the very core of the story's internal credibility.  The film's visual imagery does indeed derive from the Disney attraction - statues whose eyes follow people around the room, dancing transparent ghosts, singing disembodied heads - but there's a world of difference between a 5-minute amusement-park ride and an 85-minute full-length feature film.  Before green-lighting the project, didn't any of the executives over at Disney ask if anyone had come up with a movie worth making?  Given the results we see on screen, the answer is ""apparently not.""

There's no point here in launching into our perpetual lament over the downward spiral that Eddie Murphy's career continues to take.  After all, if he isn't worried about the squandering of his once notable talent, why should we be?  Life is just too short for that.",1094256000,,2573,4.87816091954023

1983679,3,B0001A79G2,"Here goes Disney again with another ""Ride-inspired"" movie...

First the positive: The special effects were very good, the intro was fantastic, and if I were 12 or 13 I probably really would have liked this movie. I also love to see African-American families starring in films without the need for a white counterpart. This is a great family type film, with some good values, but it may be a bit scary for young kids due to great skeletons and several suicide/death scenes.

Now the bad: This movie was surprisingly slow. I felt it drag... often. The plot has been done so many times that I don't think the writers even woke up to write the script. The characters were all very shallowly portrayed- although the Butler was decent and the Crystal Ball was entertaining. (And my dad who nearly killed us for making him watch this, loved the singing statues.)

Does anyone else find Eddie Murphy amazingly annoying? I don't think he can be anyone other than the Donkey from Shrek anymore. The whole movie I wanted to punch him in the face. And the actress who played his wife was awful. The kids were decent though.

So my advice? Its a well done albeit lame movie. Rent it as a family flick, but don't watch it too late at night as it might scare young children.",1092355200,,1259,4.533039647577093

 Eddie Murphy plays an overly ambitious real estate agent who ends up at the mansion with his family trying to strike up a deal with a few ghosts. The story is horribly hokey! The acting is silly and filled with typical Murphy antics: silly laughing and funny smiles.

 The best part of this movie is the special effects and the graveyard scenes. I found the movie to be a bit scary for children as some of the zombies are very ""real"" looking. For adults it is an evening of silly fun but sadly for young children they might spend their evening with nightmares instead of giggles!",1090281600,,844,4.461038961038961
1983681,3,B0001A79G2,"To start off, yeah, it's nowhere near as fun as ""Pirates of the Carribean"", and much of it comes off like a too-long episode of ""Scooby Doo"".  Still ""Mansion"" is a lot of fun.  The plot?  Essentially lifted from years worth of lore about the Disney ride (little if any of it actually created by Disney), a broken hearted southern gentleman commits suicide when his ""true love"" apparently does the same.  About a century later, the ghosts of the suicide, the butler (Terence Stamp) and some other household guy (played by Wallace Shawn) are trapped in his mansion.  The titular house itself is practically buried by the Louisiana bayou and, in the tradition of haunted houses, under tons of cobwebs.  Instead of a van of meddling kids, the Mansion plays host to Jim Evers (Eddie Murphy) and his lovely wife Sara.  Murphy's character is a work-a-holic real estate agent who manages to snag every customer in the southeast, while neglecting his family.  Luckily (?) Sara is the spitting image of Elizabeth, the lost love of the mansion's owner.  Invited to tour the mansion with the idea of selling it, and faster than you can say ""I see dead people"", Murphy and crew find themselves trapped in it by its spectral residents.  With the help of Shawn's ghost and also a crystal ball containing the disembodied head of Madam Leota (Jennifer Tilly in a role that also originated with the ride), Evers and family plumb the mysterious environs of the mansion for a way to save Sara and escape.
This was a light movie that completely slips out of your head like a ghost five minutes after it's over.  Murphy doesn't get as much mileage out of his mugging persona as he has in movies like the ""Cop"" series or as in ""Golden Child"" - but he still does a good job with the kind of movie role that even Bill Cosby couldn't grasp (check out ""Ghost Dad"" and prove me wrong).  As for kids - my 7 & 4 year olds loved it.  There was a possibly risky scene with Murphy and his character's daughter trapped in a crypt with an army of skeletal zombies, and the fiery climax of the movie unleashes a fiery demon, but most of the flick treats the spectral world with the same lightness as the ride had.",1090195200,,2177,4.5089058524173025

The soundtrack is decent, but it doesn't blow away your mind. They are pretty good with mood music, like in times with sword swinging action (which mind are rare) you get fast, jumpy music.

1983707,4,B0001A79G2,"Come on, people! What, is Eddie Murphy suddenly cinematic poison to you all? Is he not still the funny, charming comedic actor that *all* of you have laughed to in the past?? Is it suddenly uncool to like him...or to like a film based on a Disney ride??? (Can you say PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, perhaps??) Am I missing something, because I just don't get your reactions on here at all!
Listen, it's true that Eddie Murphy has made some duds recently in his career, such as THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH and I SPY (both 2002)---unseen by me as of this writing, by the way---but he's also still making hits (and great films), too: witness SHREK (2001) and the still brand-new SHREK 2, and it is really questionable as to whether Mr. Murphy's star has really gone out. I mean, he also made BEST DEFENSE in 1983, and then went on to the mega-hit BEVERLY HILLS COP the very next year. Besides, some of our greatest and most respected actors such as Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino have starred in bad movies---THE FAN (1996), ISHTAR (1987) and CRUISING (1981), respectively, so it's pretty unfair to act as if Murphy's the only one who's made some crappy choices. And it really doesn't matter what other films Eddie has done, anyway. We are discussing THE HAUNTED MANSION (2003) on these pages, so let's just take the film by itself as it is.
This is an extremely well-made film that is a feast for the senses. Everything---Art Direction, Set Design, Costumes, Makeup, Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing included---was made painstakingly with great attention to detail. I'm baffled by one obviously ill-informed reviewer who commented on 'the cheap CGI effects'---what??? Just by watching the movie, I could tell that *nothing* about it was made on the cheap. And if that hadn't convinced me by itself, then the two documentaries (""The Making Of The Mansion"" and ""Anatomy Of A Scene - Ghost In The Graveyard"") would have done the trick. As it is, these docs really made me appreciate even more all the great work that makeup artist extraordinaire Rick Baker (truly a legend in his craft), costumer Mona May and all the rest did. And if that weren't enough, the DVD gives us a superb interactive tour of the Gracie Mansion! I have just seen the DVD after getting it from Netflix. After watching it, I know that I want to buy it!
Eddie Murphy and British actress Marsha Thomason star as Jim & Sara Evers, of Evers & Evers Real Estate. In the opening scene, Jim is showing a couple a house (no, not the haunted one) of which they're not quite sure they want to buy.  We're treated to another fine example of Murphy's comedic timing in this scene, where his wife calls about spending their anniversary night together and he's making it seem to the prospective couple as if he's speaking with another interested couple. In true pop psychology form, the couple in the room immediately make their move to purchase the house. Of course, this setup is just to establish the characters of Jim & Sara, and soon they're off to the Gracie Mansion (no, not the NYC Mayor's house) to which they've been invited (well actually, just Sara) by a spooky-sounding man who presents himself as the representative of the interested seller. Of course, the spooky man turns out to be the butler Ramsey (played to great spooky effect by the wonderful Terence Stamp). They also meet Master Gracie (Nathaniel Parker) whom, we learn, fell in love with a black girl named Elizabeth in the 19th century who committed sucicide (or so he thought) when they realized they could never marry due to the obvious societal pressures of their day. It's an effective back story that speaks to the issues of race, intolerance and true love. But the real treat is the house and its ghostly inhabitants.
Sure, this isn't a *great* film; however, there really wasn't anything I didn't like. Everybody was well-cast. I liked the Evers' children, Megan and Michael, played respectively by Aree Davis (if she looks familiar to you, that's because she's the sister of Dee Dee Davis, who stars on ""The Bernie Mac Show"" and Marc John Jefferies (yep, the People PC spokesman!). Both are smart and engaging. I also liked Wallace Shawn and Dina Waters as the helpful ghostly couple Ezra & Emma. Jennifer Tilly is great as Madame Leota, a ghostly disembodied head in a crystal ball! All in all, THE HAUNTED MANSION is a great way to take your mind off things and just have fun for 88 minutes. That's all it aims to be, and it delivers well.

1983708,1,B0001A79G2,"Everyone likes the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland and Walt Disney World, but will they like this film based upon the classic amusement ride?
  The first flaw is Eddie Murphy was cast in the lead role.  Don Knotts was once chosen for a part, but negotiations did not work out.  I kept thinking of other actors that would fit the bill better, Robin Williams, Paul Rodriguez or even Tom Hanks and Shelly Long.
  Black people do get hypertension, so maybe the film works.  Black people do not like to be portrayed as stupid, though.  I was disappointed in this film.  I did not care for the casting of Eddie Murphy or the cast of ""a black family"".
  I was hoping for a definitive story of the Haunted Mansion with the pirate and the bride.
  I did not care for the written-for-the-movie story of an unprofessional African-American real estate agent and his family being scared in the Mansion.
  What does make this film fun are the recognizable surprises from the real Haunted Mansion in Disneyland (Anaheim, California USA): The coffin carriage outside the mansion, Master Gracey's hanging, old man with dog, hitchhiking ghosts, ballroom dancing ghosts, floating candelabra, hand from the coffin and Madame Leota.
  Madame Leota is played by Jennifer Tilly in this film version.
  There are many other interesting things from the real Haunted Mansion and some Hidden Mickeys too.
  Bonus features include a 12-minute featurette ""The Haunted Mansion--Secrets Revealed"".  An 11-minute featurette, ""Anatomy of a Scene: Ghosts in the Graveyard"".  There is one deleted scene and 63 outtakes, ""Superstition"" music video by Raven, audio commentaries and Enhanced Computer features for your PC.
  The best feature of this entire DVD is ""Disney's DVD Virtual Ride: The Haunted Mansion"".  There are three trails through the Haunted Mansion.  The first trail takes you upstairs in the Hallway.  There are two different variations.  The second trail is a spooky one to the Ballroom.  It plays straight through.  The third one is to the library.  if you choose not to click on the small statue bust, then your trip will end soon and differently.  If you choose to click on the bust, you will find the ""secret room"".  if you complete the trails, the two ghosts will see you again with the carriage behind them.  This will lead you to the cemetery.  There you have two more trails.

1983709,4,B0001A79G2,"""The Haunted Mansion"" is a really funny, if somewhat awkward hybrid of horror and comedy all mashed up in one 90 minute adventure in one movie.
 It all starts with a real estate husband/wife partnership where they sell houses to various tenants and but the workaholic lifestyle is straining their marriage as Jim Evers is working longer and longer hours. Later on they hear about an old grand mansion in the remote parts of Louisiana they think/believe that they have brought upon themselves a grand opportunity but when the whole family gets there they however realize that this is no ordinary old grand mansion. A very old butler named Ramsley greets them as does his master Gracey who lost his dear beloved lover many years ago to an `accident' and has been tormented with grief ever since then. However, the only way to `move on' is to discover the truth behind the death of Master Gracey's beloved.
This place is haunted by tormented spirits `trapped' down on earth. Jim going through all of the mayhem meets a ghost that inhabits the mansion and discovers that the only way to save himself from the curse that enshrouds his family is to `break the curse' that has trapped all of them in the place of darkness and free them and this is told through a psychic crystal ball with immense psychological powers.
 This movie is really a lot of fun with a sort of watered-down Addams Family style visuals but I don't really find it to be all that scary. In fact, I find this movie to be a lot more funny and humorous slapstick fun than comedy horror but this movie offers lots of laughs. Adults may not find a lot to write home aobut with this movie but Eddie Murphy fans as well as younger audiences will find lots to enjoy on this movie. It's not an essential movie by any means but it is worth a look if you have too much time on your hands.",1084492800,,1842,4.462908011869437
1983710,2,B0001A79G2,"""The Haunted Mansion"" stars Eddie Murphy who lost any cool attitude he had in the 80s, and looks as if trying to corner family picture genre since his ""Dr. Dolittle"" films.  I don't care what ever he does as long as it is funny, scary, or whatever.  The fact is, this ""Mansion"" is not remotely funny, scary ... whatever it is.  Well, whatever it is, I am sure this is one of the worst pictures ever made with Disney logo, which this film certainly doesn't deserve to wear.
The cliche-ridden story need no summery.  Eddie Murphy's character is dealing with real estates, and neglects his family too busy doing his business.  Well, of course he relents soon,  but when he takes out his family (one boy, one girl, one beautiful wife, as usual) to the holiday ride, he still drops in a big old house where a creepy butler (Terence Stamp, coming directly from Hammer horrors) introduces his master Nathaniel Parker, who must hide some secret behind the handsome face.
These incredibly uninspired story could be still tolerable if there are enough humor or scare in it.  Sorry, but the film's scare means a big loud banging noise (the most artless way any kids can think of), and its humor means Eddie Murphy's incessant chatting and mugging which remind me of Martin Lawrence.  And it might be cruel to add this, but the acting of kids are not good.
Campy fun could have saved the film from the entire mess, but Jennifer Tilly (who could be fun if given a right material) is literally confined in a small territory, reciting some silly rhymnes.  The lush production designs are fun to see, so is Terence Stamp who surely understands his role, but the rest of the main characters, doing everything in a too straight manner, have ruined anything that might have come from the better part of the film.
As many reviewers rightly said, if you want to see a film based on Disney attraction, see ""Pirates of the Carribian.""  It is fun to watch Johhny Depp, who knows how to take risks, doing different things with talant and experience.",1084320000,,2024,4.612813370473537
1983711,1,B0001A79G2,All I have to say is this movie was way too scary for my kids.  They couldn't even make it through the entire movie before asking to turn it off.  We bought the DVD and opened it so now we can't return it.  Parts I thought were a little frightening.  There is one part where Eddie Murphy and the daughter in the movie are being chased by several skeletons (reminded me of Michael Jackson's Thriller video) while being trapped in a large tomb.  I wish we had never purchased it.  My kids don't even like to look at the DVD cover.  Funny part is my kids have watched The Lord of the Rings and were not scared by that.,1084320000,,615,4.117647058823529
1983712,3,B0001A79G2,"To say this movie is bad for the numerous reasons reviewers list here so generously isn't 100% fair.  This all depends on your expectations.  I mean really, how good can you expect this film to actually be?  A family/horror/comedy based on a ride at Disneyworld with Eddie Murphy?  C'mon, what expectations did you really have?  I never would have rented this film on my own free will, I can tell you that right now.  I rented this film coz it was a fun night with just my daughter(she's 5) and I, and I had her pick out the movie.  She could have done much, much worse.  I can't stand the ""family"" films that come out anymore, but I didn't mind this one bit.  Is it a good movie in the horror sense?  No frickin' way!  Is it good as a sidesplitting comedy?  No.  Is it a good film to watch with a small child when your other options are Olsen twins, Spy Kids 26 and Barbie-Swan Lake?  You bet your butt it is!  Basically, that's how I'm judging this film.  In terms of the family viewing crud out there anymore, this is on par with Citizen Kane.  If you wanna put it up against something like Kill Bill, well of course it's lame.  This movie has enough to entertain the kiddies as well as keep the adults from nodding off to sleep.  Some reviewers have complained that this may be a tad too scary for some children.  That may be true,  but honestly.....who cares?  Can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen(that's the first time I've ever said that).  Personally, I liked some of these ""too scary for kids"" moments.  One in particular has Eddie Murphy and his daughter in a mausoleum where all the dead people come crawling out of their graves.  This was actually pretty cool, quite Romero-ish.  Good make-up by Rick Baker too.  Terence Stamp is cool, as always.  Though Eddie Murphy has really softened up over the last decade, he can still pull a few laughs out of you.  This film would make perfect viewing on Halloween night if you've got kids who aren't old enough to watch Last House On The Left yet(but make sure they see that one at some point in their lives).  So, if you have your kid(s) pick out a movie to rent and watch with you, consider yourself very lucky if they grab The Haunted Mansion.  Just tell yourself that you could have been one of the unlucky parents who ended up watching Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch instead.",1083888000,,2341,4.374418604651162
1983713,3,B0001A79G2,"From Bob Hope to Don Knotts to even Francis the Talking Mule, haunted house comedies have long been a cinematic staple.  After tackling the inept THE COUNTRY BEARS and the surprise hit PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, it was perhaps inevitable that Disney would base a film on its scariest and most popular ride, THE HAUNTED MANSION. Comedian Eddie Murphy, who would become a family favorite after successes in both SHREK and the DR. DOLITTLE films, was picked to lead the cast. What results is a film that unfortunately breaks no new ground in the haunted house genre, but is mildly amusing nevertheless.
Murphy plays Jim Evers, a real estate agent whose work is slowly overwhelming his ability to relate to his family, including his business partner and wife (Marsha Thomason).  When Thomason's character gets a request to sell a haunted mansion, her husband (smelling a hot business deal) and kids come along for the ride.  What results is a series of spooky, wild and crazy events that ultimately force Mr. Evers to refocus his priorities.  Along the way, he'll have to contend with ghostly butlers, disembodied heads, and a wide variety of goofy ghosts and goblins.
By now, Eddie Murphy has become an old hand at playing workaholic fathers who learn the importance of family, while wise-cracking his way through the film.  It's no different here. Murphy's solid, but not spectacular. Marsha Thomason is lovely and practical as Murphy's romantic foil.  Terence Stamp is delightfully creepy as the ghostly butler, while Wallace Shawn and Dina Winters are amusing as a ghostly couple who help Murphy.  However, it is Jennifer Tilly who garners most of the bigger laughs as Madame Leota, the disembodied head floating in a crystal ball, mainly through her rather ""been there, done that"" attitude.
For the most part, the humor ranges from somewhat cute to pretty lame.  Indeed, the film will generate more smiles than laughs, especially for the adult crowd.  (A quartet of singing busts in the cemetery gets the award for garnering the best laughs.)  The production design is very handsome, however, and the special effects definitely capture the spirit (no pun intended) of the ride on which the film is based.  Overall, THE HAUNTED MANSION is definitely an amiable time-waster that will definitely amuse the kids.  Adults looking for more filling entertainment are better off looking elsewhere.",1083801600,,2389,5.0508905852417305
1983714,3,B0001A79G2,"This movie vascillates from being amusing at certain points to quite dull at others. The story line, for the most part, feels rehashed...though it's difficult to say from where. It's probably because we've seen it so many times before. The story behind the ride seems like it was invented pretty darn quickly. The acting is mediocre and the movie's not hilarious or extremely touching or memorable or anything. It's moderate in most respects. The funniest scene is the barbershop quartet of singing stone heads, and it's nice to see them get tied to the back of the family station wagon and driven home at the end (though you might wonder why they'd bring such annoying little sculptures back with them!) The gypsy in the crystal ball, Madame Leota, is among the more likable and endearing characters, along with Emma and Ezra. In fact, they really should never have cut out the deleted scene with Emma and Ezra. This isn't really a movie that most people would want to rush out and see, but if you're into slightly cheesed-up Disney stuff or have younger kids, it's worth a viewing or two.",1083715200,,1090,4.742105263157895

This film was not a huge success at the box office, and there is a reason behind this lack of box office magic. The script is predictable and truly dull. It is not entertaining for adult or teens. The special effects are not really special and MURPHY's brand of acting/comedy is dated (very 1980s). Not a wise investment as a DVD purchase.",1083715200,,465,4.614457831325301

similar to viewing Pirates of the Caribbean, those who have made a tradition of riding The Haunted Mansion will be tickled to death ;-) at the little touches that was done to bring various parts of the ride to life. i found myself singing in the movie theatre to ""grim grimmy ghosts about to socialize!"" moreso, the movie has served as a powerful advertisement to visit a Disney theme park in the near future, as i hope to do this summer. i found myself anxiously waiting for the DVD, and, sure enough, i purchased my widescreen edition within the first week of distribution.
the extras on the DVD were also very informative and enlightening. i just ate everything up.
don't be surprised, however, if you actually get a little spooked while watching this movie. while its definitely no slasher horror film (thank goodness), it does have it's creepy moments. like it's themepark counterpart, there are parts of this visual ride that are both jovial and fun and parts that do bring a chill up your spine.

The special effects for the movie are fantastic. The mausoleum scene is riminiscent to me of ""Pirates of the Carribean"" - this would be the only questionable part (in my opinion) for children under the age of 10. Very realistic dead folks!
I loved the 999 Grim Grinning Ghosts and the Theme song along with it. The ghosts are SO DISNEY! If you've been on the ride, you know what I mean.

I actually went and saw it three times while it was in the theatres with my friends. I also don't think this movie was meant to be scary at all maybe for little kids but not for adults I still liked and thought it was good. So I do very much recommend this movie to anyone who likes a little scary and a little comedy movie. Good plot and good movie for the kids to see also.,1082937600,,548,3.945945945945946
1983719,4,B0001A79G2,"I do not understand all of  the rips folks are giving this film.  Granted, it isn't the funniest or scariest film in the world, but it is planted somewhere in the middle.  That's a good thing for a movie trying to appeal to such a large demographic.  Eddie Murphy does a superb job here(better than in ""Daddy Day Care"") of making his character the perfect salesman/father-figure.  Terence Stamp is flat out creepy as the butler.  The rest of the cast, especially the kids, are all fine in this movie.
Here's a brief synopsis of the plot:
Murphy's wife is called to ""sale"" an old mansion for it's owner.  However, it's all a ploy to get her there because the owner thinks that she is his long-lost love from years ago.  Once there, things occur that try to eliminate the rest of the family from the picture.  Twists and turns ensue, and Eddie makes you laugh throughout the film.
Most of the family can check out this movie.  I wouldn't let really young'uns watch this, however.  I'd keep the age limit at eight and above.  There is a little foul language, but not nearly as much as on primetime network TV these days.  I think the total cussword count was somewhere around four.  There are a couple of sequences that may be too frightening for the small kids, especially one scene in an old crypt where tons of baddies wake up and try to catch Eddie and the kids.  The rest of the film is full of light-hearted, ""Boo!"" type scares and some friendly ghosts that will help settle your child's fears.
This film is definitely more family-oriented than ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" though ""Pirates"" is a better story.  The special effects were handled by the same folks on both films, so you won't be letdown in that area.  The visuals are stunning.  I agree with others that the scenery is beautifully done.  The mansion looks and ""feels"" old.  The ghosts are reasonably believable, but they remain true to the ride this film is based on.  The music is both haunting and humorous at the same time.  It really sets the mood for the movie.
As far as the DVD goes, the transition from big screen to small screen is flawless.  The sound is great and the extras are fun.  I really recommend this movie.  It's fun for most of the family and it's a visual extravaganza.",1082937600,,2257,4.5
1983720,3,B0001A79G2,"You know how, when a movie is overly-hyped, that sometimes by the time you see it, it's like -- What was the big deal?
Well, the reverse works, too - sometimes a movie is put-down and criticized sooooo badly, by the time you see it you say to yourself, ""This wasn't so bad"" --
""The Haunted Mansion"" begins by showing us real estate agent Jim Evers (Murphy) closing yet another deal.  Turns out the guy is one hot seller, but it's been at the expense of spending time with his wife (and business partner) Sara (played by the beautiful Marsha Thomason) and their two kids -- daughter Megan and son Michael.  Finally wising up to the fact that he's been working too much, Jim agrees to take his family away for the a weekend to the lake ... after stopping at just ONE MORE appointment, when Sara receives a bizarre call from a creepy-sounding butler whose master wants to sell his home.
The butler, Ramsley (Terence Stamp), was VERY adamant on the phone that Sara was to come alone, but Jim (as usual) takes over, and the family drops by on their way out of town.  This turns out to be a huge mistake, for they're immediately trapped in the old mansion when a storm washes out the one and only road to the place.  And when Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), the master of the house and a dashing gentleman with eyes for Sara, shows his true hand at what he has planned, it'll take all that Jim and his kids have to break the curse that hangs over the haunted mansion -- and save Sara's life.
This is a great film for a family to watch - kind of spooky for really young kids but otherwise okay (I'm a single guy, and even I liked it, so it's not JUST for families, either).  Eddie Murphy grated on my nerves at first as Jim - but then again, he should have, because Jim was a workaholic in need of a wake-up call.  The special effects are top-notch, and Murphy is backed by a supporting cast that keeps up with him nicely (including Jennifer Tilly as the fortune teller Madame Leota -- a floating head in a crystal ball of green smoke).  Some laughs, a few chills, and maybe a bit too much of a smarmy ending make the film enjoyable -- and, at only 82 minutes, not too painful even if you don't like it!
A friend of mine brought this over to watch, but I plan on buying my own; it's a sweet little spooky comedy that is easy on the eye, and good for when you want to just pop it in your DVD player for a quiet evening of tame entertainment.  And again -- I put this on with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.  On its own merits, the film works beautifully.",1082851200,,2563,4.257201646090535
1983721,3,B0001A79G2,"As one who once worked and trained Cast Members at WDW's Haunted Mansion, I can say the overall film does justice to the visuals of the attraction, but it suffers from there. Alienation in the family and its repair is not a new phenomenon in film.  What's changed is the lost art of subtly making the point without hitting you over the head with it.  Mary Poppins worked because Walt Disney made this point without making it the *obvious* point of the film. Subsequent efforts, such as Hook and now The Haunted Mansion, have stumbled because they've made the ""moral of the story"" so obvious there's  no self-discovery in the viewing; that and there's nothing I hate more than a film that has to preach its point, rather than make its point.  There IS a difference.  Aside from this problem, the Mansion stumbles in one other critical point. (And, no, sorry to disappoint all you Eddie Murphy bashers, it's not his presence.  In fact, he does quite a nice job at making his character obnoxious in a suburban middle class sort of way.)  The problem is the finale execution.  The story, in fact, is very well set up and, like its attraction origin, has a good balance between the scares and the comedy.  The problem comes during the mock wedding when Ramsley is exposed.  What follows is the common TV dilemma of ""we've painted ourselves into a nice corner with a great set-up and only have 10 minutes to solve the problem we've created. What do we do now?"" The ending, particularly Ramsley's demise, courtesy of a fire dragon, apparently is on loan from Lord of the Rings, is carried off with dithered mix of non-explanation and overdone sentimentality. The result is a great build-up with a lot of preaching about the importance of family through muddled climactic writing.  Disney (And Sir Steven) would do well to review Mary Poppins. There is no substitute for clear writing and a important point made, not told, along the way.",1082851200,,1929,4.6943620178041545

The ending was certainly beyond the PG rating, more like PG13 with the things shown definitely above a childs level but presented in a very scary way.

I wanted to love this movie because I am a Haunted Mansion fanatic... I own every souvenier, sound effects album, copy of blueprints, etc.... available on the Haunted Mansion attraction and it's history.
Regarding the movie, it was nice to see them use Walt's original idea for the architecture and the original 1950's Gracey mansion legend.
Maybe only die-hard Doombuggy fans picked up on this dedication trivia.... BUT... the movie just did not come together in a successful way like Pirates did last year.
It is probably still good family entertainment for 90 minutes or so... but nothing that will leave a lasting memory or impression.
It felt like a movie ""made by committee"" where so many different people's input collided in such a way the movie just plodded along with no real life or ""spark"".",1082764800,,994,4.818713450292398
1983727,3,B0001A79G2,"Well, my parents are both real estate agents, so they, as well as my brother and I, got a real kick out of the real estate humor that the movie sported early in the movie. But the movie quickly went downhill after that.
The idea of putting the cherished Disney ride into a movie is pretty awesome when you think of it, but I felt that the movie did no justice to the ride.
If I had to describe this movie in ten words or less, I would say it was 'lame, but had some good points.' If there was no Eddie Murphy in the movie, it would be a waste of effort, time, and money, but since he was in the movie, I can't say the movie completely stunk. I felt the ending of the movie was rushed, it just ends with the family driving.....I don't even think they mention it, with those talking head-sculptures on the roof. I, presonally, didn't like the ending at all.
I think the movie might be a litte too scary for kids under 8. I think perhaps the movie is scarier than the ride. I wouldn't just assume if a kid could handle the ride that they could thoroughly enjoy the movie. But it's a hard assumption, because Eddie Murphy's charm seems to make the movie great for kids. It's a tough call. In the movie, some parts were scary, and some parts were just weird. Like, for instance, Sarah Evers was forced to drink poison so she would die and live with some guy who thinks she is his long-lost love, but instead of dying, some angel or something comes along and goes into her body, and she comes back to life. Weird, right? Also, at the beginning of the movie, during the opening credits, the movie briefly shows, well, the story you see in the ride. And in it it shows that the guy hung himself. I think the movie should have been triggered to a specific audience. Kids or Teens to Adults. Some parts were really scary/weird and some parts were just silly and funny.
I would rent this movie before buying it if you hadn't already seen it.",1082764800,,1930,4.233062330623306

But Jim's addiction to his work is starting to affect his relationships at home. Even his wife and business partner, Sara Evers, is losing patience with him. When a couple of new customers cause Jim to miss an anniversary date with his wife, that's the last straw. He has to promise a full, family weekend at the lake to make up for it. So Jim, Sara, and their preteen kids, Megan and Michael, are all set for a fun little vacation when the phone rings at the last minute.

It's just a quick little stop off at the Gracey Manor in New Orleans, what's the worst that could happen? The owners want to sell. Too many...bad memories. But in no time, the family finds they must stay the night as a sudden rainstorm has flooded the road. The wife and kids aren't thrilled, the creepy butler Ramsley and the suspicious staff were enough to put them off, but Jim is overwhelmed at the idea of selling the huge place. And Mr. Gracey is thrilled to have them, especially Sara, who reminds him so much of someone he loved long ago. It doesn't take long before we realize that a plot is underfoot. It also doesn't take long before we discover that the inhabitants of Gracey Manor aren't what they seem to be. In no time, the movie gets kicked into high gear, as the Evers family members find themselves on a quest to save their beloved Sara from a houseful of restless spirits!
""The Haunted Mansion"" is far better than most people might lead you to believe. Had it come out after Disney's ""The Country Bears,"" it might have been hailed as a fantastic achievement (unless people just avoided it), but on the heels of ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" well, how can a cute little family comedy compete with one of the greatest action/adventure films ever made? Still, when judged on its own merit, Haunted Mansion is a fine film, well worth purchasing and repeat viewing. With the fantastic skills of effects master Rick Baker and the comedic talent of Eddie Murphy, along with another of Disney's best rides as a basis and several nods to it throughout, the fact that the film could probably have been better isn't enough to detract from the fact that it IS quite good. I mean, most movies could be ""better."" If you judge everything like that, you probably only actually like about 4 or 5 movies. Now, I'm not saying this movie doesn't have some obvious flaws. Marsha Thomason may be beautiful, but her acting is pretty bad. Perhaps she was focusing too much on hiding her accent. And sure, the film could have been funnier, and it could have had more scary moments, though that Zombie sequence was pretty darn good.  Overall, ""The Haunted Mansion"" is a highly satisfying night of entertainment. If you're a fan of the ride, it should be all the more fun, and the rewatchability level is pretty high on this one. Definitely not the total disappointment it was made out to be. I purchased this one not sure what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. The extras on the disc are pretty good too, though I would have loved to have seen more, including some of the old Disney TV programs about the ride. I'm surprised the cartoon ""Lonesome Ghosts"" wasn't included on this one, since it seems to be on every spooky Disney release. The behind the scenes stuff  was pretty neat though. At any rate, I'm happy to give this film a thumbs up! Loved the singing busts and hitchhiking ghosts, and Madame Leota was pretty cool too! Props to Jennifer Tilly for pulling off a role that I had originally wanted Phyllis Diller to play. The only thing missing was Don Knotts as the Groundskeeper!",1082592000,,3705,4.533632286995516

boy was i wrong.
funniest parts are whent hey insulted Eddie Murphy.
 they butchered the ride to amke it ""oh i know this part"". Paul Frees' genius is long and forgotten in this 1 and 1/2 hour sleep machine. they based too much of the movie on opresumptions and guesses about the ride and did too little with what they actually had.

1983730,4,B0001A79G2,"Jim Evers is committed to his real estate business, almost to the exclusion of his wife, also his partner in business, and kids.  When they are offered an exclusive listing on a stately manor outside of town, it's too much for him to resist, and he insists on stopping on the way to a weekend trip.  While they are eating dinner (they didn't seem to have much of a choice), a fierce storm comes up they are trapped for the night.  The old place is creepy, however.  As the characters get separated, they start to find strange things going on.  Slowly, Jim and his kids begin to realize they must solve a mystery if any of them are going to get out alive.
Unfortunately for this movie, it came out so soon after PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN that the comparisons would be inevitable.  It had huge shoes to fill, and comes up short.  It is a fun movie in its own right, however, and deserves a look.  The plot turns into a decent mystery that had me confused for most of the time.  It does feature family movie cliches (workaholic dad, kid with a certain fear they'll have to over come), but builds in enough other plot elements these are kept to a minimum.  Fans of the ride at Disneyland will find lots of fun nods to the inspiration to keep them entertained.  There are funny moments throughout the movie.  Probably my favorite gag was with the singing busts.  I may have been the only person in the theater to get it, but any fan of barbershop quartets will appreciate it.
I've never been a fan of Eddie Murphy, and I did find his over the top acting to be annoying.  But the other actors stepped up to the plate and kept me intrigued in spite of the lead.  I especially enjoyed seeing Wallace Shawn in a hilarious turn as one of the mansion's servants trying to help Jim and the kids solve the mystery.
Don't be deceived, this movie will scare young kids.  It is half comedy and half jump fest that works remarkably well.  It's a tad creepier then the ride, so don't just use that as a guide.  It would probably be best to watch it first and determine how your kids will react.
Disney has done this DVD right with a nice widescreen transfer and surround sound.  In addition, they've got some great behind the scenes features and my favorites - outtakes and deleted scenes.
Those looking for a light scary movie will enjoy this.  Just make sure your kids won't get nightmares first.  A good film to make a family Halloween tradition.",1082505600,,2430,4.391498881431767

like William Castle's original 13 Ghosts (1960) and Don Knotts'
The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1965). The ghosts play it straight and dead serious and leaves the comedy to Eddie Murphy and family. There are also many scenes that reference Disney's theme
park ride. Such as the singing busts, the ballroom waltz complete with a ghostly organist, and the hitch hiking ghosts even get their cameos. The story is very simple. A nice family
is trapped overnight in The Haunted Mansion, trying to find a
way out. There is also a subplot that deals with reincarnation,
and a 122 year old murder mystery. A really fun movie. My favorite scene: The Gothic Mausoleum. Rick Baker has produced
the best rotting, skeletal walking corpses I have ever seen.
Seemingly straight out of a 1950s EC horror comic.

The movie is just like the themepark attraction: simple and clean fun...for young AND old.
It isn't the most sophisticated movie ever made, but we have allready seen that in PotC. The movie is entertaining from begin to end and captures the feeling of the original ride.
Don't expect a horror-fest or a ""bruce allmighty""-like comedy though....just a great - don't have to think about anything - evening on the couch with a loads of popcorn.",1082419200,,476,4.678571428571429
1983733,4,B0001A79G2,"""The Haunted Mansion"" is a great mystery movie. It tries to be funny, and it is sometimes, but there is never anything hilarious in the film. However, what it lacks in comedy, it makes up for in the drawn out storyline. The storyline is not only great, but easy for most families to relate to. Workaholic Jim Evers(Eddie Murphy) misses his anniversary, so to make up for it, he is taking the whole family for a weekend getaway. However, when he gets the opportunity to sell a mansion, he forces the family to make a pit stop. A flash flood strands them overnight, causing the Evers to get tangled up in the huge mystery hidden within the old, spooky, haunted mansion.
Anyone why has ever been to a Disney theme park and ridden the ride will get a big kick out of this movie because there are a lot of references to the ride made throughout the film. The special features are greatly disapointing. The is a behind the scenes featurette which is very short and uninformative. There is only one deleted scene, and to make this fact worse, the commentaries are filled with references to other deleted scenes. The Haunted Mansion virtual tour is boring and won't be able to hold a child's attention for the whole 23 minutes it takes to tour. There is some good in the extras section, though. The anatomy of a scene feature is very informative about how the digital effects where used to make the ghosts, and on the DVD-ROM portion of the disc, there is a history of the attraction.
This film takes place at night in a dark mansion filled with ghosts and zombies, so it will definatley scare small children. Other things parents may object to is the use of the ""C"" word mostly by adults, but once by a 10 year old. Another thing parents should watch out for is the fact that somebody is sucked into hell. That person was bad, but I can see where parents would object to this. All things aside, ""The Haunted Mansion"" is a very good movie that your family will be able to enjoy for years to come.",1082160000,,1988,4.434426229508197

This film should have done more like its predecessor The Pirates of the Caribbean, and been set not in modern times but in maybe the 1600s.  The acting wasn't that great, and in my opinion Eddie Murphey should've stick to the PG-13 and up films.  The story was way too predictable and didn't live up to the ride.  In my opinion, you will get more laughs and satisfaction by going to a Disney Theme Park and ride the 2 minute ride, instead of trying to sit through this hour and a half flop.",1081296000,,615,4.142857142857143
1983735,3,B0001A79G2,"The Haunted Mansion is Disney's 4th movie based on a ride if you count the made for tv Tower of Terror.  It's often fun, funny and even romantic. It's far from being one of the best movies I've seen though. There's scenes where the movie can actually be funnier. I mean Eddie Murphy is a funny guy and a talented comedien but his lines just get a giggle. The movie has a lot of good chances for humor but it doesn't take them. For instance Murphy and the talented Terrence Stamp (The Limey) as the butler could've had much funnier scenes together. Instead through most the movie, it just has Stamp walking around and creeping up on people. He looks good in the role and is well in character but the script fails to do anything really funny with him. He's pale with his hair sticking up in the air and he walks around like a zombie and the only way Murphy pokes fun at him is by saying he needs a tan....haha.
  I mean they could've thought of something more clever than that. The movie could've been laugh out loud funny especially with Murphy in the lead....but it's not. Don't get me wrong there's some laughs but I don't think there's enough, well not enough from Murphy anyway. The singing statues from the ride are funny, they work best in the movie. I also liked Jennifer Tilly as a gypsy spirit trapped in a crystal ball, that's what I think she's meant to be anyway. People make fun of that saying, that's stupid, is a talking head in crystal ball. I think it's meant to be that her spirit is trapped in there some how though. Anyway the ideas that the movie took from the ride itself are actually what work best. I'm basically just giving it a mild recommendation for just rental not to buy. Eventhough Pirates of the Carribean was a great movie based on a ride, Disney needs to be more original though. You can tell they are slumpted on what to do next if they stoop as low as making movies based on rides. So what's next Space Mountain with Colin Ferrell ? lol.",1079136000,,1972,4.338753387533876

This movie has an ""I can't stop watching because there might actually be something interesting coming up"" feeling to it:
-The camera movements along with the special effects make it visually appealing.
-The story line is so pale, shoddy, and predictable that it insults the intelligence of not only adults but the children viewers as well.
-There are a few one-liners which are adequately funny, but they really should have added ""canned laughter"" so the audience is tricked into thinking it should be funnier. Had they done so they would have had to change the ""cinematic music"" as well as adding the movie to a slot on the Disney Channel (where it BELONGS).
Overall another Disney failure, complete with state of the art special effects, no plot, and poor acting. Perhaps a PS2 spinoff game would work better? Or maybe they should stick with keeping their amusement parks out of the cinema.

In know that Eddie Murphey's fan base isn't necessarily spilling over, but I don't really believe that this is the reason for this.
I really enjoyed the Haunted Mansion, and I will definately be buying this movie on DVD, but that's because the movie literally was tailored to people like me:  a huge fan of the ride.
Pirates was successful because the movie stands alone as a film.  While the movie was based on the ride, the film only made nods to the ride here and there.  The film had it's own story, it's own characters, and didn't try to make a story out of an attraction with no real story.  In know several people who have never been on the ride, and they absolutely loved this movie (yeah, Johnny Depp helped out a little.)
The Haunted Mansion did the opposite.  The movie is literally a translation of the ride to the big screen.  While this is good for fans of the ride, it isn't so good for those who have never been on the ride.  While I really enjoyed watching for the nods to the ride, I also recognize that someone who didn't see the novelty of the film would merely think it was a mediocre rip-off of the 1999 version of The Haunting.

I've never seen Mr murphy playing such a bad role and don't tell me he's a bad actor,the guy is brilliant but it's pretty obvious that the script wasn't. It feels like a kids movie,but even kids won't like this and are used to more funny things then this.

1983746,4,B0001A79G2,"I think I was looking forward to this movie, be it's Eddie Murpehy and because I've been seeing the ads for a very long time. The movie exceeds more in the makeup, sets, and costumes department, and decreases in the story department. The movie stars Eddie Murphey, Terence Stamp, Marsha Thompson, and Wallace Shawn, and not all of those characters are among the living. It was a good movie, but I feel that the story could have been much better.
The story is about Jim and Sara Evers, who both are realtors, but Jim focuses hard on work. This is proven when Jim has a couple of drinks with some clients on him and his wifes anniversary. He would also sometimes rather work than spend time with his two kids Megan and Michael. He decides to go away with them over one weekand but Sara gets a call to come to work, and Jim forces them to go stop by on the way to their vaction spot because the house is in a rich location. They go there and find an immense mansion. They meet the head butler Ramsley, the others staff Ezra and Emma, and the master of the house Master Gracey. After heavy rains flood the roads, the family decides to spend the night in the mansion. When Master Gracey requests to talk to Sara, she finds out the story of his tragic past, including the death to his dear love Elizbeth, who looks alot like Sara. Jim and the kids get lost around the mansion, and Jim meets Madame Leota, a fortune teller who is just a head inside of a crystal ball. As ghosts and monsters begin to come as the night, Jim and his kids try to help Sara from being the answer to a longtime curse that has been inside of the haunted mansion.
""The Haunted Mansion,"" is a horror movie for children, a genre that should have much more in the works. It's a horror movie without gore, and because of Eddie Murphey generates quite a bit of comedy. Alot of people think that Eddie Murphey is slacking off as his career gets old, but I thought that his past three movies were very good, and this one just adds to his list of good movies. I don't see how the critics thought that this was a terrible movie. It wasn't awful, but it did have it's problems with it's story. I could see Disney making a sequal to this movie though. It was better than Disney's other ride movie ""The Country Bears,"" but it wasn't as good as ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Worth a check out in the theatres.

1983748,3,B0001A79G2,"Disney has been making movies about their rides at their theme parks for a while now. Their first one, the Country Bears, was awful and was a complete waste of time and money. After the Country Bears, I wasn't expecting much from their second movie based on a ride, but Pirates of the Carribean was amazing. Then this movie... The Haunted Mansion came next. After Pirates of the Caribbean, I was really expecting a lot, but my hopes weren't completely filled.

The Haunted Mansion starred Eddie Murphy, which was the downfall of the whole movie. Without him, the movie would have been much better. All of his stupid jokes made the movie lose so much.

The story of the movie is slightly different from the backstory of the ride. On the ride, Master Gracey is the narrator. He was a crazy guy who for no apparent reason besides from being a ghost, hung himself. So after that he started haunting his mansion, allowing 1000 happy haunts to share the mansion with him. Everyone else in the mansion eventually died. The maids and butlers hang around and haunt the house, letting living guests in. Master Graceys bride (in the attic scene in the ride) commited suicide since she couldn't cope with her husband to be's death, and her broken heart could be heard throughout the attic. Then there was Madam Leota, who trapped herself in a crystal ball so she would live forever and was able to possess dolls to see outside her ball. 999 silly spooks haunted the house and let guests come through every day trying to find that 1 person to fill up the last spot as a happy haunt.

The movie was based on the ride but was a bit different. It centered on the Evers family who ran a real estate business. They got a call to represent a huge mansion, and Jim Evers (eddie murphy) couldn't resist. Before going on a family vacation, they stopped at the mansion, and the creepy butler told them that they were wanted to stay for dinner. During dinner with Master Gracey, the road flooded and the family was trapped in the house. They agreed to spend the night, and were shown their rooms. Then Eddie Murphy gets called to speak to Master Gracey, and while he is waiting, he finds a secret passage way and gets stuck in it. He eventually finds his way to Madam Leota, where he finds out about the curse on the house. Then Murphy's wife gets a tour of the house from Mr. Gracey himself, and eventually it is found out that the butler was evil, and he ment to kill Murphys wife so she could marry Mr. Gracey because he believed that she was his reincarnated bride to be that was poisoned and died. Leaving out some of the details in case you want to see the movie yourself, eventually the ghosts all get to go to heaven.

The special effects in the movie were amazing, as well as all of the makeup and stuff. Everything in that section was flawless.

But the movie did have some inconsistencys that made it lose some stuff. I didn't like the changes that they made to the story line. They should have kept the story more along the lines of the ride. Also, in movie time, it took eddie murphy a good 3 hours to figure out the house was haunted, even though he was surround by ghosts, who even admited they were ghosts. Another thing. Many times torches would be taken out of a spot, but in the next shot the character who took them out would still be holding the torch, but another one replaced it. And finally, at the end of the movie, the Evers got to keep the house, and they took Madam Leota with them, which is understandable since she lives forever, but they also took the singing heads which should have no longer been haunted since all of the ghosts went to heaven at the end of the movie.

Overall, it was an ok movie. Nothing great, but fun to a Haunted Mansion fan.",1073260800,,3756,4.404899135446686

There is even a few scares along the way to make this film somewhat appealing, even though it is very cliched and trys to hard to be funny in certain scenes. Murphy has been better, but he is restrained by the family rating and does what he can with the role. Terrence Stamp is very good as the butler.

Who would have thought that at this point the Walt Disney Company would be at a big crossroad with their adaptations of classic theme park attractions? When the family oriented studio announced the trio of ride based features, many were quick to call Disney executives crazy and desperate for story ideas. Most of the movie-going public would have agreed with them after the embarrassment that was The Country Bears in July 2002. Almost one year after that box office flop, Disney bounced back big with the surprise hit of the summer, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which steamed rolled its way to $300 million domestically and possibly two sequels. With both a hit and a miss in their hands, Disney's third and final theme park adaptation, The Haunted Mansion, could swing either way but the company executives would have it be a hit for sure. The presence of star lead Eddie Murphy should assure this. Granted Murphy has had plenty of recent adult oriented flops such as Showtime and I Spy but his reputation as a family film star has been remarkable including his most recent hit, Daddy Daycare. Can he continue the streak with The Haunted Mansion? If the marketing campaign for the film has anything to say about it, the answer should be a big yes.
The story focuses on a man who enters a haunted house with his family and must do whatever he can to save them from its ghostly in habitants. Jim Evers is a successful real-estate agent along with his partner wife, Sarah, but doesn't seem to find the time to spend quality time with his family. He's missed soccer games, anniversaries and barbeques for his work. Seeing his problem, Jim decides to take the entire family out to the lake for the weekend to make up for his mistakes. At the last minute, Sarah receives a call for her to stop by the Gracey Manor to help sell the decrepit estate. She at first declines but Jim urges her to take up the offer for the sake of the business and the family. Unfortunately they get more then they bargained for as creepy incidents occur around every corner and the entire mansion itself seems to be hiding a disturbing secret. Jim Evers must discover the mystery in the Haunted Mansion before it's too late for his family and himself. The story for The Haunted Mansion, though well intentioned, seems lacking and predictable. The opening sequence of the feature ruined any suspense for many later events and could have been done in a different way that didn't give away much of the story before the audience even had a chance to settle down in their seats.
The cast of The Haunted Mansion is a relative bunch of no names but they try to their best, which works effectively for the most part. Eddie Murphy leads the group with a moderate performance as Jim Evers. The problem lies in the fact that Murphy is not all that funny in the feature and really isn't given anything to do that gets a laugh. Nathaniel Parker, who portrays Master Gracey, gives a wonderfully Victorian style performance that's both creepy and effective. He starts off a sinister character but by the end, you realize his true intentions are as evil as they may seem. Terence Stamp achieves an amazingly creepy performance as the butler, Ramsley. Though the character seems to be a supporting role at first, as the feature rolls on he becomes more central to the storyline and therefore much more effective. Jennifer Tilly is a delightful highlight as Madame Leota (aka the floating head in the crystal ball) and stays true to character within the attraction for most of her time on screen. The only disappointment in the casting area involves Terence Stamp and Dina Waters who play the servants of the mansion. Stamp, who is most famous for his role in The Princess Bride, could have been used in a more humorous way then he was here but the filmmakers fail to do so. The two were barely used at all which results in a disappointing aspect of the feature, which could have been avoided if they were used more prominently.
Overall, Foolish mortals should heed this warning! If you are looking for another Pirates of the Caribbean, wait for the film's sequel rather then searching for it in The Haunted Mansion. Not to say that the film is not entertaining, it has its moments, but The Haunted Mansion doesn't even come close to the spectacular filmmaking that was presented in the summer swashbuckler. The problem lies mostly in the plot that is often flat and predictable ruining many of the film's twists before they are even set up. So what is the offender of this horrible filmmaking crime? The actions of the opening credits. If you have to see this film but don't want the film's secrets given away early then keep your eyes closed for the first three to five minutes. If anything reasonably favorable can be said of this film, it has to be the solid special effects and the creepy atmosphere the filmmakers are able to maintain despite a weak story. Disney fanatics will love the many tips of the hat towards the inspiration of the film including the hitch-hiking ghosts on the side of the road. There is no doubt that this film will be a family-friendly hit over the Thanksgiving weekend but for those looking solid filmmaking should save their money for the likes of Elf.",1071360000,,5451,4.667359667359667
1983753,2,B0001A79G2,"After PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN turned out so well, I had hopes Disney would succeed again with my other favorite Disneyland ride.  Eddie Murphy has certainly become the king of light, enjoyable ""family"" comedy, and the trailers made the special effects look promising.
But Murhpy gives a totally generic performance.  Any sitcom actor could have done it...there is virtually no ""Murphy"" on display.  The movie spends a great deal of time early-on letting us know what a hard-worker Murphy is and how he never spends time with his family.  WOW...I've never seen that character trait in a movie before!  And we're told this about Murphy so that later in the movie...NOTHING.  No reason for it...just fills time early on.
The movie is set, supposedly, in Louisiana, but there is absolutely NOTHING in the feel of the movie that makes it feel anything other than California suburbs.  And the ""ghostly owner"" of the house is British...kinda.  There isn't a smattering of cajun to be found and enjoyed anywhere.
In fact, I would say everyone in the film comes of as generic, except Terence Stamp, who plays the ""butler"" of the mansion.  His voice and physical manner are best two gags in the movie.  I hope he got a big paycheck...this fine actor deserves it.
The laughs are few and far between in this noisy movie.  The scares are not to be found anywhere, even for a young child.  There is also one moment of absolutely gratuitous nudity (granted...it's on a tarot card, but it IS full frontal) that totally takes the adult viewer out of the movie.  Suddenly, my wife and I are sitting there thinking...""didn't they know this was a kids movie?""  The moment is brief, but you shouldn't get jarred out of a movie for so stupid a reason.  It's almost like having someone drop the ""f-bomb"" during a PG rated movie...sticks out like a sore thumb.
There are some amusing nods to the original ride...including the barbershop singing busts.  They made me laugh.  That was about it for any genuine humor...that, and Terence Stamps delightfully droll performance.  But that absolutely does NOT make this movie worth seeing.",1071187200,,2109,4.827298050139276

1983755,3,B0001A79G2,"THE HAUNTED MANSION, like the far-superior PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, is based upon one of Disney's amusement park rides. Now, I'm not sure how good a story can be written, let alone how good of a movie can be made, based upon an amusement park ride. Still, it's a brilliant stroke of marketing genius because Disney owns everything about the movie, including the idea that is was originally based upon.

Anyway, THE HAUNTED MANSION stars Eddie Murphy as a real estate agent, Jim Evers, who is caught up in his career. His wife is also his partner in their business, but she has her priorities in order. While on the way for a family vacation, Evers takes a side stop to check out a mansion the owner wants to sell. The stop was only supposed to last twenty minutes, but ends up taking the whole night and leads Evers and his family to go through all sorts of horrors to escape.

THE HAUNTED MANSION is kind of a cute movie and children will probably enjoy it most, even if they do get a tad frightened. The movie could have been much better, but unlike the characters in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, the characters weren't allowed to develop into anything more than what they are on the ride (perhaps with the exception of Leona, the talking head in a glass ball). Therefore, though THE HAUNTED MANSION isn't a great movie, it is a decent one and since it feels so much like a ride, you won't feel cheated for having watched it.",1070755200,,1425,4.4559386973180075

(Not an animation, but an actual person.) 3. It has a startling beginning that would bother *anybody* that doesn't like it when things jump out of nowhere without warning.
I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but my 10-year old daughter probably wouldn't have been able to stomach all of the ""surprises."" The special effects were excellent, and the comedy is vintage Eddie Murphy.",1070755200,,712,4.6141732283464565
1983757,1,B0001A79G2,"Starring the long since defanged and neutered Eddie Murphy (long gone are the days when this contemporary trickster god entertained with his razor sharp impressions and randy deconstructions of American culture), THE HAUNTED MANSION is nothing more than a flaccid, shallow, joyless and obvious attempt to sell more amusement park tickets.
Unlike the similarly focused and vastly superior PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, HAUNTED MANSION hobbles its potentially gifted cast in a graveyard of moribound cliches, tired one-liners and zombie-like performances from able bodied professionals (Terrance Stamp, Wallace Shawn, Murphy). Much of PIRATES' charm lay in its willingness to let its cast chew scenery and delight in over-the-top performances.
Despite a fine moral- Dads must devote more time to family than career- THE HAUNTED MANSION languishes on screen for what seems like an eternity. Such a film should deliver a rollercoaster array of thrills, suprises, and gasps of wonder- a reaction that an amusement park ride inspires. Hmmmm great idea.

However, if you're an adult, you most likely will not find a whole lot to entice you here. ""A Haunted Mansion"" comes across as a plodding grade-""C"" horror movie at best, as evidenced by the elementary degree of a sufferable plot, and an adequate dose of special effects. But, these ""qualities"" aren't the worst things about this movie. It's the 'supposedly funny' ""comedy"", combined with the poorly conceived ""fright train"" that brings the proceedings to a screeching halt. Giving its ""star"" Eddie Murphy very little room to work with, doesn't help matters, either, as Murphy appeared stiff and uncomfortable throughout the movie. The only actors who delivered close to star-quality performances, are Terence Stamp and Nathaniel Parker, as demented ghosts. As per their acting here, one can clearly see their Shakespearian-type training has paid big dividends, as both Stamp and Parker are the real stars of this picture. In contrast, Eddie Murphy's talents as both a dramatic and comedic actor are clearly wasted here, as per the above description. Mr. Murphy needs to desperately reprise his roles as an Axel Foley and Reggie Hammond-type character, and therefore needs to make another ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""48 Hrs."" tour de force - otherwise, Mr. Murphy will find himself slipping into a debilitating coma - one that he'll never, ever recover from if he continues to base his career on doing children's-only films. Moreover, what would really help revive Murphy's fastly diminishing career, is if he goes back to doing stand-up comedy, to which, even if he cleaned up his routine, he would resurrect his career in that department as the TRUE ""Golden Child"" once again. For the adults, the only recommendation for a viewing of ""The Haunted Mansion"", would be to see it BEFORE doing your Christmas shopping, as well as to amuse the kids. That way, you won't have to worry about a cure for the doldrums, or insomnia, for that matter. CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: 4 STARS; ADULT ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: 1 1/2 STARS.

1983767,3,B0001A79G2,"THE HAUNTED MANSION is the latest film I've seen where ordinary folks see dead people. The last was GOTHIKA. The original was, of course, SIXTH SENSE. It's evidently an inconvenient talent. (A very clever knock-off of the theme was THE OTHERS of a couple years ago starring Nicole Kidman. Its subtitle could have been, ""I see live people."")
Eddie Murphy and Marsha Thomason are Jim and Sara Evers, a high-powered husband and wife realtor team. Sara is invited by Mr. Gracey (Nathaniel Parker) to visit his home for the purpose of listing the property. On the way out of town for the weekend, the entire Evers family, which includes son Michael (Marc Jefferies) and daughter Megan (Aree Davis), stop by the Gracey place, which proves to be a gothic, ante-bellum mansion back in the Louisiana bayous. There's a creepy cemetery stretching to the horizon out back. They're greeted by the sinister butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp). A convenient downpour closes the road, and the Evers must stay the weekend. Serious bummer for them as Master Gracey covets Sara's bod (in a G-rated sort of way).
Is this a scary movie? It provided a couple of frissons. Children may find it more frightening.
Is it amusing? Reasonably so. Eddie Murphy's humor is the constant which holds it all together. And there are a couple more chuckles coming from un-dead housemaid Emma (Dina Waters), who makes cookies, and the disembodied head of gypsy fortune-teller Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly), who inhabits a large crystal ball.
The special effects are more or less up to the current standard, which makes them  at least good overall. I particularly liked the household spirits, which morph in and out of a swirling ectoplasmic smoke that was quite well done.
The acting is, for the most part, adequate. Young Davis as the unflappable Megan occasionally steals the show and was my favorite player. Stamp tries so hard to make Ramsley ominous that he just comes across as wooden. Thomason is wholesomely pretty, but not much else.
Is this a great film? Not by a long shot. Is it even memorable? Nah. The plot is contrived and silly. But you won't feel cheated if you see it even at today's extortionate prices. And the kids will probably enjoy the hell out of it.",1070323200,,2234,4.83289817232376

And it's a good thing.  I was pleasantly surprised when they came out with the very entertaining ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" this summer, but ""the Haunted Mansion"" doesn't quite deliver on its promise so successfully, as hard as it tries.
And it does try hard.  From the typically sumptuous sets that a Disney movie can afford, to the great comedic talent of Eddie Murphy, this movie could have had the right mix of atmosphere and comedy to be both a satisfying homage to a beloved themepark ride, as well as a fun piece of entertainment.  But this House falls down in the storytelling area, from where it can't quite get back up.
The story did have potential, it really did.  It included enough ""explanations"" of various parts of the ride, that it could satisfy any annual passport holder to Disneyland, like the Hitchhiking Ghosts, the guy hanging from the ceiling, or the wedding dress in the attic.  But the moths in that dusty attic must have been running amuck, because there are too many holes in the fabric of the story.  Whenever there was a chance for a character to explain or develop part of the story, they seemed instead to take the time to harp about a vague evil curse in the house, the origin of which we can only speculate about.  Okay, the house is cursed, but why?  Okay, one servant is evil, but why?  Okay, there are lots of spirits hanging around in the backyard cemetary, but is it too much to ask, why?  It's left up to you to guess, but then, they don't give you a satisfying answer.
This movie is probably worth viewing just to pick out the references to the ride, and to see a funny Eddie Murphy picking his way through them.  It's not too bad for kids, except for one scene that belongs in the Thriller video, that could be frightening to the young ones.  Just be sure to ""look alive"", and beware of the plot holes, which, like Hitchhiking Ghosts, will haunt you all the way home.",1069891200,,2155,4.384422110552764

A storm breaks out, forcing the family to take shelter in the huge, dilapidated house.  Once inside, the family is separated, and it's up to Jim to face the haunts of the mansion to break the curse upon the house which threatens his family, especially his wife Sara.
Eddie Murphy is great as Jim Evers, but his comedy takes a bit to warm up in the beginning.  Marc John Jeffires and Aree Davis are wonderful as the Evers children, Micheal and Megan, and bring much fun and humor to their roles.  Terrance Stamp is a ghostly villain as Ramsley, and Nathaniel Parker does a fine job as Master Gracey.  Jennifer Tilly does a fine job, as well, as Madame Leota, even though she is given some of the cornier lines in the film.
The special effects are incredible, with all the ghosts in the graveyard, the changing portraits, the materialization of the ghosts, and much more.  Fans of the ""Haunted Mansion"" attraction at Disneyland will love all the references to the ride, from the hitch-hiking ghosts and the singing busts to the protrait gallery and even the crow that guides you through the ride.

The storyline in a nutshell is that the Evers family, who own a real estate business, get stuck in the Gracy Mansion during a rainstorm and discover a huge mystery. Sounds pretty corney, but I'm leaving a ton out so you will be surprised. The story has a lot of twists and turns along the way, but nothing too hard to follow. Some moments may be too scary for the little ones, but it wasn't as scary as ""Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets"". I also felt that a family movie could have done without swearing (just the ""C"" and the ""A"" word), but it's definately not as bad as the content in ""The Cat in the Hat."" If you've ridden the ride, then you'll have a great time noticing certain moments taken directly from it. My favorite parts were the hitchicking ghosts and the singing busts. I was also worried about Jennifer Tilly playing Madame Leota (the woman in the crystal ball), but after seeing the movie, I don't think any actress could have done a better job.

I don't think I will ever get tired of seeing it and can't wait until it comes out on video.  Make sure you stay AFTER all credits are over.  It seems that I'm the only one who is sitting in the theatre and see all the surprises at the ends of movies just like with Pirates.  It's a wonderful movie and they did a wonderful job with it.  Congratulations to all who worked on this wonderful film!",1069804800,,828,4.359477124183006
