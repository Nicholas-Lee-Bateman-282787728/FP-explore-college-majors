8686102,5,B00P1TC6LG,"Great disc! There's been some questions and confusion regarding the region coding and I can't remark on the DVD but my BluRay is marked regions ""A, B, C, Worldwide"", so it plays in the USA. It'd be great if Amazon had it listed correctly. It's a cool Jake Bugg show, but I wish the edit was longer and that the little interview vignettes were kept separate from the concert footage. At least songs aren't interrupted mid-song. Quality is really good, but it's only stereo 2.0 or DTS-Stereo. A 5.1 mix would have been nice. It's interesting to hear Jake with the additional musicians, like Iain on lapsteel, and Matt and Jason who played on Shangri-La (Jason on keyboards here, not bass. Robbo has that covered), but the arrangements seemed like they could have been worked on better. I know I'm nitpicking a bit, but there was a bit too much of the organ pads when they really didn't need to be there, and some of Matts guitar parts I wish fit better. Don't get me wrong... the guys are great... I just think the additional parts would have benefited from some more thought or rehearsal. It's really a non-issue for most listeners. Iain's lapsteel is nice and Johnny Marr's guest guitar on three songs was great. And Jake's vocals and guitar are in great form. Robbo and Jack are great too. I hope they get to play on record three. Don't think twice. Pick this up!",1420848000,5,1364,4.548780487804878
8686103,5,B00P1TC6LG,"Great DVD quality and awesome live concert by Jake Bugg.  For anyone not real familiar with the artist and his work, this DVD makes a fantastic introduction to him and his music.  Lots of small vignettes spread throughout the concert of him talking about his music roots and how he approaches writing and performing. A truly gifted, talented performer - and he is so humble and grateful for his success. He has such a great perspective on things. I find myself days later sometimes humming one or more of his songs. There are many concert videos of him on youtube, but this DVD is a much higher quality and much more intimate with the artist.  I highly recommend this DVD - you won't be disappointed.  I only wish the DVD presented the Albert Hall concert in total from beginning to end without commentary interruptions - but there aren't really that many, so it's OK and they do add to introducing the artist to his audience and new fans.  Good job!",1420761600,,950,4.564705882352941
