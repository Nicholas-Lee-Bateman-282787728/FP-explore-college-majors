8344747,5,B001URA5R0,The book and the DVD of the same title provide an excellent resource for Small Groups and/or Adult Bible Fellowships on Sunday or mid-week Bible Studies - We used the book and DVD in our ABF and it was very well received.,1478822400,,221,4.285714285714286
8344748,5,B001URA5R0,"Chuck Colson  was a man that became an ""instrument "" of God. His life after conversion is an example to all who want to live a life of love for the Father evidenced by obedience and sacrifice. This book identifies the major weakness in the Evangelical movement and supplies the solution. I was so impressed with my first reading that I loaned it to someone and never had it returned. I therefore purchased a another book and added the DVD Series,and discussion manual. I have since used this in a number of small groups and loaned the material to additional individuals ( always careful to get it back ). I trust you will find this material to be a real blessing and thought provoking, leading to a deeper abiding relationship with our Father.",1434499200,,743,4.586466165413534
