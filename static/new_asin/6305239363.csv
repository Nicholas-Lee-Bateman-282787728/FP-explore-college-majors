7888126,5,6305239363,"I loved this series, and the Shroud disc is one of the strongest of the set. The investigators were not all ""believers"", and some had never heard of ""the shroud"" before. There was no bias to be overcome either way, just good science with top level researchers, including one from NASA's Jet Propulsion lab.

The findings are presented as you go along, it is not a film that focuses on the deity of Jesus and the holiness of the sacred artifact, etc. It focuses on ""just the facts"". Atheists and other realists ought to be pleased ... maybe not convinced, but satisfied that genuine technological investigation was done under supervised conditions.

The faithful should be relieved that the relic was not handled disrespectfully or damaged by the intrusion...and the knowledge that an argon-filled preservation case is the Shroud's final place of rest. It is now safe from sticky fingers and the rest of nature's hazards.

It is reasonable to suppose that if God exists, then miracles also exist. This leaves the possibility of something beyond our control being at work in the one we believe was the crucified Messiah. It is not surprising that his burial shroud would be left as one further proof of something very unusual happening in Israel 2,000 years ago.

It has been proven not to be a painting, a drawing, a stain (though it has type A blood stains), or any other known marking. The image on the shroud is not from any known process. The researchers had to admit that they define it according to what they know it is not.

The markings also match up with a college professor's demonstration of the weighted Roman scourge that would have been used, the lacerations around the head, and the wrist placed wounds that are required to suspend a human body's weight. Anatomical detail was further confirmed by an emergency room physician, who could read the Shroud image much like an X-ray. He also said that any of the several sets of injuries could have been fatal on their own, without the crucifixion.

Incidentally, it shows details below the skin surface, such as teeth and nerves.

If you like documentaries that move at a good pace, and are not dripping with bias, check it out. A keeper.",1237075200,2,2198,4.753280839895013
7888127,4,6305239363,"An excellent apologetic view of the Bible, this 1995 video uses factual and evidential findings of Shroud proponent experts in an attempt to answer several skeptical hypotheses, which attack the Shroud's authenticity.  Introducing Walter McCrone, a microchemist, and outspoken skeptic, McCrone  announces that the Shroud is an absolute fake. Skeptics believe that the  Shroud is a fake because it has no clear history prior to the middle ages  (1300's). Not true say the filmmakers, ancient manuscripts attempt to trace  its historic trail: Jerusalem to Edessa to Constantinople in 944. From  there it travels to Athens in 1205 to France in 1353 and finally to Turin  in 1578. By the 3rd C., the `Mandilian' of Edessa (Shroud) became the  universally accepted prototype for all subsequent Christian art bearing  some 250 points of congruence.  A 1389 bishop's reference to the Shroud as  being a forgery is considered suspect in that it is unsigned and the  alleged investigation at the time it cites cannot be documented. McCrone  disputes that significant telltale pollen exists on the Shroud to  authenticate its origin. Overwhelming acceptance of identification of 58  separate pollens, 41 of which directly tie the Shroud to Jerusalem, Edessa,  and Constantinople and 28 flower types found on the Shroud contradict  McCrone's view. McCrone says that he found paint pigment on the Shroud  proving that it is a fake. Shroud proponents point out that the pigment  found is iron oxide which is found equally all over the cloth and X-ray  shows that it is not found just on the image. 92 other recognized  professional artists concur that the image cannot be duplicated, even  today, and scientific radiation analysis confirms that the level of  `pigment' is no more than that of `dust' on the cloth. VP 8 image resonance  differentiates between two-dimensional and the three-dimensional imagery on  the Shroud.  McCrone did not find blood on the Shroud, however, several  other noted experts did. In fact, it was typed as human AB containing  billyrubin, which can only be caused by jaundice or trauma.  During the  1978 STURP tests, five days of extensive testing in 50 disciplines resulted  in 150,000 man-hours testing over 7 years. While no other STURP test found  credible evidence that the Shroud was a man-made forgery, carbon dating in  3 countries concluded that the Shroud dated to 1260-1390 suggesting a  forgery. Modern Shroud experts question the findings as singular,  unreliable, contaminated and question the labs' failure to follow  prescribed testing procedures. They point out materials that are known to  create false carbon 14 tests (Mollusk and Bristle pine), they show that the  known control samples (3,000 year old mummy wraps), tested and re-tested a  1000 years off and that the labs violated 14 test procedures in their  analysis. The program introduces new theorem from Moscow which suggest that  the wax and fat rendered out in the cloth's original bleaching as well as  carbon 14 impregnated into the cloth in the 1532 fire would skew any carbon  dating, calculating the real age of the Shroud to be 1900 years old.  The film concludes that most experts agree that the image was made in a  short period of time, in a radiated up and down fashion and that it was  made in contact with a 3 dimensional image. Experts state that the negative  image is most like radiation caused by lightening and that there is still  no known way to duplicate it. The narrator then asks us, if with everything  else in Christ's life witnessed, is it not reasonable to assume that the  resurrection would be documented?",961286400,23,3631,5.060913705583756
