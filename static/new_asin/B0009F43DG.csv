2287740,5,B0009F43DG,"What happens to us in high school?  That is a timeless question that countless books, movies, TV shows, songs, and everything else has tried to answer since the invention of popular culture.  Studies, friends, family, body changes, hormones, sex, hair... all topics that scare the hell out of any regular teenager and produce real drama, yet have never been explored in realistic detail.  Some shows have tried to explain what it is really like growing up in post-Kennedy-America - ""My So Called Life,"" ""Freaks and Geeks,"" & ""Undeclared"" among the most notable; but no show has tried from the point of view of the a male protagonist.  Thus is why, ""Life as we know it"" was/is such a groundbreaking piece of work.

Adapted and Americanized from the British novel, ""Doing It,"" ""Life as we know it"" follows six, sixteen-year-old kids through the first half of their sophomore year of high school.  By ditching the typical mold of the `teenage soap' the three female characters are put on the backburner as supporting characters, and the guys are given the main spotlight of the show.  The main topic of the show is the three male leads talking to each other (and sometimes to the audience) about all the different experiences they are going through.  From the normal: girls, sex, bad teachers, family divorce; to the taboo: homosexuality, erections, pregnancy scares; to the unbelievable: such as student/teacher affairs; nothing is out of range for topics.

The three male leads have been friends since their years in elementary schools, but unlike most teen soaps instead of being cookie-cutter copies of each other with different hairstyles; they are three unique individuals.  Look at ""The O.C."" all the characters come from extremely powerful, rich, and beautiful families, and share all the same interests (comic books and music) and hates (water polo).  But in ""Life as We Know It"" each of the main characters comes from completely different backgrounds.

 On the outside, Dino is your typical ""big man on campus:"" Hockey Stud, Beautiful Girlfriend, and awesome parents.  Yet on the inside he faces many problems the other shows gloss over: the nasty divorce between his parents, his failing grades, and his ""equipment problems"" with his girlfriends.  Ben can't decide who he wants to be, literally flip/flopping from group to group he can never seem to settle into any high school mold, and he seems to be overlooked by the school at large.  And Jonathan, let's be honest here, he is a geek.  The geeks in high school don't wear pin-striped shirts, the horrible hair, buy pocket-protectors by the crate, and know how to fix every computer problem under the sun (okay there are maybe one or two per school); but they are typical guys that are usually too shy to try and fit in anywhere else (I should know, I am a Jonathan).

 Offering sometimes: a partner in crime, a shoulder to cry on, or a springboard for the change; the girls in these boys lives, though not main stars are still the focus of the boys attentions and the true heart to the show.  Jackie with her alcoholic father and nervous breakdowns levels out the over confidence of Dino; Deb (the outsider with a cause) shows Jonathan that just because he doesn't fit in doesn't mean that he's not cool; and Sue, whose list of extra activities a mile long shows Ben that everyone has a place in high school, the trick is finding out where it is.  Providing the backbone to the male characters, most the storylines (while viewed from the pov of the boys) provide the many the truths discovered in the show.  This is how it really is boys and girls.  Although many of the guys will contest that they are in charge of their lives, it really is the girls in their lives that help them discovers thing that they are too thick to understand themselves.

 Despite of the shows depiction of taboo subject matter, the frank conversations, and the racy scenes, ""Life as we Know It"" never made it past the initial 13-episode order.  It had the lineage of a thoroughbred, the praise of all the critics that viewed it, and a timeslot many shows would kill (or be killed because of), ""Life as We Know It"" never found a large following.  A loyal cult following blew off the cookie-cutter ""Dynasty/Beverly Hills 90210"" remake (""The OC""), to fall in love with this unbelievably great show, only to be heartbroken when the show as pulled after 11 episodes.

 Including the final 2 unaired episodes of the show (and hopefully the additional 6 scripts that were written, yet not produced) this DVD is the most complete set the fans will see.  Even though it is too late for ""Life as we Know It"" to come back, hopefully this box set will show everyone what they missed out on.",1114646400,7,4718,4.7533742331288344
2287741,5,B0009F43DG,"Being a boy in high school, I could relate to the three main characters going through what all guys go through in high school, and I watched this show religiously.  I was so dissapointed when it stopped showing because I was so hooked I had to find out what happened next.  There were two episodes that never were aired so those will probably be on the dvd and I can't wait to find out what happens.

You have to get this dvd, it is one of the most realistic, honest shows about teenage life.  And to add on to what someone else said, if one of them would have revealed that he was gay, it would have been Dino.  Dino was having trouble getting an erection when he was trying to have sex with his new girlfriend, but then when a guy landed on top of him in hockey, he got one.  (That's the kind of thing that this show is incredibly honest about.)

Anyway buy this dvd you will not be dissapointed!",1114560000,3,898,4.15606936416185
2287742,5,B0009F43DG,"Finally, a show about high school from the guys perspective.  I found the show refreshing, smart, funny and risk-taking, something that network television usually shys away from.  In school it's hard to get a guy to talk about anything let alone what they are feeling.  I love the way it was shot with they background action stopping or slowing down and the guys just letting it all out.  The frank talk about sex was awesome.  I believe had the show survived, one of the three guys would have revealed he was gay.  It sure seemed that was were it was heading with one of them.  That would have been interesting to see how the other two would re-act.

I really loved the story lines with the adults too.  How infidelity was handled, and how it affected the kids.  Lisa Darr is always interesting to watch.  Loved her work in ""Popular"" and now this show.  She should be proud.  DB Sweeney, on the other hand looked terrible.  The bags under his eyes were very distracting (dude get some work done on those).

Kelly Osbourne had a rough beginning but proved she could hold her own toward the end.  Good job, Kelly.

Sean Faris is the weakest actor of the three guys.  He was there to provide the eye candy.  If he would study acting and learn how to get to the emotional state that the character is in, he would be a powerhouse of an actor and a great leading man.  Jon Foster has acting running in his blood.  As the younger brother of Ben (who does great work in ""Six Feet Under""), he was great as the guy who fell for his teacher.  Good emotional journey and play out very well.  Chris Lowell has a promising career ahead of him.  Wish he had the oppurtunity to show some ranged.  Love those amazing blue eyes!

I really wanted this show to succeed.  I tuned in every week and told my friends about it.  But this show was up against some tough competition.  I glad that I will be able to watch this again and again on DVD.  Buy this.  You won't be disappointed.",1114387200,2,1962,4.337016574585635
2287743,5,B0009F43DG,this is show is wicked its amazing it stars fantastic cast ana acting and its funny real and true to real life what more could you want keep in the good work guys! amazing actors/actresses wick over and out from the uk,1114300800,3,218,4.214285714285714
2287744,5,B0009F43DG,"This was a wonderful show that depicts the everyday lives of high schoolers. It was a fun, witty, charming and realistic look at teenagers today. It was wonderfully made, and the actors who portrayed the main characters and best friends did excellent. This was a great show that was gone way too soon. All I can say is that the show just fell victim to being put up against tv heavyweights such as 'Survivor' and 'The O.C.' It never had a chance.

To those who haven't seen the show, but are thinking about purchasing it...here is a brief synopsis. I hope it gives you a better picture. The show is based around 3 male best friends, Dino, the hockey player; Ben, the intellectual; and Jonathan, the photographer. They live out their everyday lives and go through all the trials and tribulations of being a teenager today. Along with their 3 girlfriends...sometimes girlfriends...sometimes just girls who are friends. Jackie, the soccer player/student council president who is harboring the secret that her father is a drunk; Sue, the one who always has to be perfect; and Deborah, formally the best friend, who now wants more.

This show does have some unrealistic points, such as a sexual relationship with a teacher...but other then that, the show is very much like high school life in the here and now. All I can say is that if you were a fan of 'My So-Called Life' (another show that was cancelled long before its time) then you will definitely love this show and I suggest you buy it. I know I will.",1113696000,13,1504,4.650375939849624
2287745,5,B0009F43DG,"One the outside ""Life as we Know it"" look like another Beverly Hills 90210/One Tree Hill rip off.  But in reality that cannot be further form the truth.  With producers from ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""My So Called Life,"" LAWKI was a realistic look on what it is like to be a teenage boy in high school right now.  Guys watched it because the main male characters were always having a crisis that comes right out of any high school in america (thats probably why many guys at my school watched it, but never told anyone).  And Girls enjoyed it because although the main characters are the three guys, there are three extremly charming and intelligent girls that help make up the cast.

Eventhough many critics enjoyed the show, the show still had many problems facing it.  The show was based on the English novel ""doing it"" and which you can guess from the title was very frank and had more sexual stuff in it than your normal teen fair.  The show (although toned down a little) still keeps that prospective of teenagers, and sicne was bashed by the FCC (in post-Janet Jackson days and several Parent groups).

Since I had previously read the book I was extremly excited when I first heard about this show.  When the pilot aired surprisingly enough I was not dissapointed, the show took the essance of the book, added a few american twists and ran with it.  Although the ratings never went higher than 5 million viewers, the show quickly became my favorite show on the air.

The show is about three teenage boys who happen to be best friends (one is a Jock, one is a Nerd, and the Other just exsist).  All three of these boys are in different areas of growing up (mentally speaking) and they are always having problems with their respected female counterparts (The Jock, the Freak, and the Brain).  But that just the outside.  On the outside the show was the most realistic look at what High School life is like in the post 2000 years, that rivals ""My So Called Life"" in the amount of depth is put onto screen.

This is show is a must for anyone that enjoyed ""My so called life"" and ""Freaks and Geeks.""  But I must warn  you if your looking of ""The OC"" I suggest ""Beverly Hills 90210"" (which is a good show in its own right when there where in high school).",1113609600,66,2253,4.429611650485437

The Show: Overall, it was not fantastic, I understand why it was cancelled, its your average teen-drama high school show with nothing overly special to offer. Its still in my movie collection but Ive only watched it once, who knows, maybe Ill get bored one day & watch it again.

2287783,5,B0009F43DG,"This show was definitely underrated, underpromoted and underestimated. It may not have the pizazz of The OC, the wit of Veronica Mars or the constant pop-culture references of shows like Glee and Gilmore Girls but it more than makes up for that in heart. This show has characters that you actually care about and dialogue that keeps you hanging on to every word.

It really is one of the best shows that was produced, it may not really potray what most of us went through growing up, but it portrays high school I'm a light hearted almost deep sort of way.  Its one of those shows that you'll watch all the way through in one sitting , just leaving you wanting more.  Very unfortunate it didn't continue, cause it definitely would have caught on. I can honestly say the casting of each character couldn't have been done better ( even kelly osbourne, who woulda thought she could pull off acting in a true way).  I can't rave about this show anymorre, it rivals even Friday Night Lights, which fourtunatly did not receive the same fate as this phnonmenal show.  We'll never know the fate of these characters, which in a way is kinda fun, you can imagine your own path for each.

2287789,5,B0009F43DG,"This show was spot on to me.  How it got cancelled is beyond me and shows that it doesn't matter if there is any substance to what companies put out today; it's all about the ratings.  Yet how it didn't get the ratings and views is beyond me besides the fact that ABC did not well advertise it.  Regardless, it is an amazing series, one that I really connect with as a younger guy (now of 19).  It is real, emotional, compelling, and knocks out every other show that tries to play the whole ""Life"" story.

2287795,2,B0009F43DG,"This show boasts a rawer approach to the the teen high school genre, it comes close to actually showing sex and has no problem going into the minds of the males that would fornicate with just about any pretty girl that would have them.

Life as we know it does some things that are good, but ruins them somewhat by not truly committing to the serious, everyday concerns.  The things it presents that are commendable include: parental separation, divorce, starting over, monetary responsibility etc.  It's as immature as you would expect and in some ways the way it deals with these issues sometimes better than I expected. One of the best things about the show are the non-photogenic uncool people just coming up and talking to these guys and pretending like they're friends, it's priceless when it happens and it's almost a bad thing since it raises the question of do these guys only talk to people when the script requires them to be extroverted outside of their close knit of friends.  Furthermore, I feel the constant asides the three main characters make are unnecessary and ruin the raw sexual feel and immature character of the show by making these characters actions somehow seem more wholesome and likeable when they're not.  That is my opinion and I know that people disagree, but my vote is that the gimmmick is one of the things dragging the show into not being as good as it could be.

The show doesn't truly take any of the romantic relationships seriously which is why show feels like it's going to fast and doesn't stop to really appreciate the nitty gritty details of what a raw depiction of teenage life should be.  Ben's relationship in the beginning happens way too fast to be believable (even if it does happen that way in real life) and Dino's troubles with Jackie are just too grievous for it to be possible for them to be any more than friends from that point on. More importantly (and confusingly) the show both does, and doesn't get how to portray the family unit.  While Sue's family works wonderfully, as portrayed, Jackie's, Jonathan's, and Ben's don't have enough time to build.  It's the worst off in Jackie

s situation especially with her father being a drunk, we can't truly feel sorry for her if we don't really see what her life could be if he wasn't a drunk.  Although that's bad, the tragic thing is about Ben's family because he has a wonderful cast to portray them and Ben himself is the best performance of the show. Dylan Baker and Betsy Ann Baker (from Freaks and Geeks) are always good, but just feel tacked on most of the time so that when the episode comes where they have a serious conflict with Ben you feel like you don't really know them and here's where it becomes obvious that when it comes to shows about the youth experience, there's the men and the boys.  Freaks and Geeks is the man because it never really had to justify why it would spend an episode with the parents as a strong storyline because the storyline was so well written and in this series you don't really feel (I didn't) that there was a storyline, just ideas that never really came together and the writers expected the audience not to recognize this because of the good looking actors and the constant asides to them.  This is discouraging since some of the same producers from Freaks and Geeks worked on this show and a number of the cast members who pop up on the show were from Freak and Geeks, as well as other quality entertainments.  It's strange when this happens because the show almost doesn't know what to do with them due to the fact the show isn't about them, but they're clearly better than the show they're on. Even the main characters seem lost when this happens, like when the three protagonists get the new job at the wilderness store.  The only time the character acting role integrates itself is when Peter Dinklage plays the counselor.  It feels just right and makes the characters truly work to become real.

As a whole, I don't recommend it to people who are fans of Freaks and Geeks, a truly well-made series, but since this series is better than many series that remain on the air, I recommend it to people who believe that TV on DVD is stupid and unnecessary, I do believe this series deserves an audience on DVD, despite my objections, because Disney makes entertainment for mass audiences and families and I think there's something for the teenager, broken family, or even the cocky kid who looks like Tom Cruise who never got over himself in high school. Plus, there's tons of eye candy for the people who don't watch it for the story development (probably a lot more than I would care to guess).",1156377600,6,4647,4.586248492159228

2287812,4,B0009F43DG,"I loved this show from the first episode.  However, it didn't even make it through a whole season.  Luckily, they packaged it all up on DVD and released it with the unaired episodes.

The show reminded me quite a bit of ""My So-Called Life"" from a guy's perspective.  Though, the scripts weren't quite as tight.  The show did have quite a bit of potential and a great cast (Lisa Darr from ""Profit"" and ""Popular,"" Sean Faris from ""Sleepover"" and ""Reunion,"" and D.B. Sweeney from ""The Cutting Edge"").  The stories were interesting.  However, some of them were borrowed from other series (student sleeps with teacher/teacher leaves town when the relationship is revealed).

It delt with things people deal with everyday. So I will stand up and say that L.A.W.K.I. was and is one of the best shows ever ended.",1125273600,3,547,4.121495327102804
2287815,4,B0009F43DG,"I began watching Life As We Know it at the second episode. Since then I was hooked. As a senior in high school, not only was the show realistic and funny, but also was very enjoyable to watch. The only things I have noticed with this DVD is that for some strange reason the episodes aren't in widescreen, and 75% of the songs on the DVD are different from the original score. In one scene, Ben gets a ride form the teacher and the original song (which fit perfectly I might add) is replaced by another. The second time it happens, Ben is in the car after buying some alcohol and Dino calls him over the phone and asks him what he's listening to. The music was originally a feminine song that matched quite well with the scene, but the DVD for some reason has a song that, really, makes no sense. However, despite the changes in songs, (fans of Frou Frou and The All-American Rejects, sorry, both of the songs are taken out from the carnival) the storylines and memorable characters still come alive on the DVD and make it worth every cent.",1125014400,,1039,4.360824742268041
2287826,2,B0009F43DG,"Granted, this show is not the worse show of all time (hence the two stars), and compared to anything on ABC's Friday night sitcom line-up or any of the fat guy / hot wife CBS sitcoms, it is positively genius.  With that said, this show was just ""bad"", I mean just terrible.

I am a huge Ozzy Osbourne (pre reality show) fan, so I was disappointed to see Kelly Osbourne doing this trite watered-down schlock.  She had a strange, on and off British ascent, and the English ascent she did use in no way sounded like she was from Seattle.

First of all, the actors, male ones in particular, looked ridiculously overage.  These guys looked like they way be in their late 20's, which made their hamming it up with the expresions and mannerisms of 14 year old's even more disturbing.

Second, let's talk about some of the characters and storylines.  The girl with the slutty reputation who really is a good girl at heart.  The girl who is being pressured to have sex by her boyfriend but isn't ready.  The outcast boy who relates more to adult women (particularly a teacher).  The 20-something hot teacher who has sex with her student.  The mother of one of main male characters who cheated with Hockey couch.  That character's father having a relationship with a female friend's mother.  The girl who is chubby, but has a heart of gold.  Shall I go on ..  Hey haven't we seen these storylines before .. maybe on Days of our Lives.

Third, the show was trying to be shocking, but was just laughable.  Maybe they should have tried HBO, but the network obviously watered it down so much that the impact was minimal.

If you want to watch this sort of show, but entertaining and compelling, watch Degrassi Junior High.  This show is trite and redundant.  The characters and storylines are not original, nor interesting.

Shows like Beverly Hills 90210, and the O.C. work because they know what they are .. soap operas.  They don't take themselves seriously.  On some level they know they are ""bad"" and are designed as entertainment only.  This show was a soap opera but didn't know it.  It's like that friend of yours who is going to try out for American Idol.  She just doesn't know how bad she is and nobody will tell her.  Well I told her, and I'm telling you.  This show was not informative, it was just a ""bad"" soap opera.",1124755200,4,2317,4.518072289156627

2287828,5,B0009F43DG,"i happened to come upon life as we know it when abc family played the pilot around 11 at night. i happened to catch the later half of the episode and i was hooked. although i loved all the storylines, ben and monica (ms young) were the two that grabbed my attention the most. Who hasn't had a crush on a teacher? ok so its pretty slim that you'd have one as attractive as marguerite moreau, but i'm sure i'm not the only one intrigued by their relationship. Although monica went kind of nuts.. i still loved the stress and tension in their relationship. The parent groups can go off on it being wrong all they want, and i agree. But that doesn't mean that i'm not going to watch. Its like when you drive by an accident.. you probably shouldn't look.. but you still do. But going on with the rest of the show.. its just brillant. So many funny lines. The advertisement for this show did nothing for it.. just the way they were set up. And then, lawki is basically just one of many freshman shows that get the unfortunate boot because they were placed on thursday nights. I for one am so excited for this dvd to come out. I'll never forget about this show.. and everytime i see a yellow bug i still think back. I definitely recommend this dvd!!",1123804800,2,1242,4.2893617021276595

2287830,5,B0009F43DG,I was completely amazed at Life as We Know It. It is one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. It is very realistic from a teenager's point of view. Its not like every other soap opera type show thats out there. It really stands out and has that real feel to it. The OC and Laguna Beach are boring and nothing compared to this show. It doesn't give off the vibe of being fake and I think that is what makes it so great. It's also really funny. This show goes into the minds of the three main characters and you know exactly what they are thinking. It's filled with every emotion and doesn't stop getting better.

One has a girlfriend whoes a little overweight, another has a girldfriend who seems perfect, then another gets invoved with a teacher.  This show is never a bore, something exciting always happens.  Once you start watching your never going to want to stop.  I highly recomend this DVD because sadly this show was cancelled.  It was on Thursday nights the same time as the OC, so I think the OC beat it out.  This DVD has two unaired eposiodes that im sure all fans are dying to see.

It is better than most shows on TV, especially related to high school, but I would not even say it is better than the OC.

There are these annoying scenes where time stops and the character talks to the audience and it just feels unnecesarry and forced.

Sometimes it almost seems to focused on sex and not on character. Freaks and Geeks address sex but never lost focus of the characters.

There are some genius moments but it is not a 5 star show. I might be inclined to give it 3.5 for the viagra incident alone. That was comedy.",1121040000,3,729,4.185714285714286

2287836,5,B0009F43DG,"ABC's cancelling of 'Life As We Know It' is easily explained: It's based on a British book - and the reliance on Steadicam work - and characters taking to the camera just as too literate, too European and not linear/American enough for Disney, which holds the purse strings at ABC.

When this gets out of the satellite-and-cable ghetto that 15 episodes have shown in the UK - and onto network TV - it'll pick up a large audience. Its style is fairly European. Not American enough for the Mouse It's already a cult here - even though the edgy station that showed it  - and Boston Legal, Will & Grace, Queer Eye..., The L Word and CSI - counts 250,000 as an avalanche of viewers. So, believe me, it's good to see the resolution - though even that feels hurried.

Expect series 2 if the Mouse's moneyhandlers realise they got it wrong - probably when the Sean Faris is on Medicare.

Pity.

'Life As Know It' was the victim of the Mouse's assassination of the head honcho at ABC. Those Housewives survived - but everything else he developed was ripped from the schedule. Vandals

2287837,5,B0009F43DG,"It's ironic that, given ABC's super-season of ""reviving episodic dramas,"" that it would drop the ball so completely on a great, well-written show like Life As We Know It. Although this show is all about teen angst and issues, it was anything but typical, and dealt with topics like sexuality, dating, identity etc. in a frank and funny way.

The three main male characters/best friends depict three different ""types"" (the stud, the sensitive nerd, the easygoing one in the middle), but didn't devolve them into stereotypes. The couples and relationships involving the three guys were well-drawn and nuanced: The stud has a troubled home life that impedes his sexual exploits, and is the one who faces the most pressure to exaggerate about his ""conquests."" The one who seems least likely to ""get laid"" is actually the first one with the opportunity. The beauty has self-esteem issues. And on and on.

All of the young actors did a great job with their roles and weren't just cast for their pretty faces (a la WB's numerous teen dramas). Furthermore, there was attention paid to the adults as well, something often missing from teen-geared shows, and the parents were characterized in an equally complex and engaging way.

I really appreciated the candor and unsentimentality with which all the issues were addressed (no afterschool-special melodrama here), which doesn't mean it didn't have heart. You watched these flawed, confused teens (and adults) stumble and mess up and try to fix their own messes, and rooted them on even when their actions were pretty sleazy (a guy telling everyone he'd slept with the school slut to hurt his ex). I really wish ABC had given the show more of a shot instead of changing time slots repeatedly and failing to promote the show with a fraction of the attention devoted to ""Lost"" or ""Desperate Housewives.""",1117584000,9,1842,4.9546925566343045

This show had the same thing going for it that Freaks and Geeks, and My So-Called Life had going for them, honesty.

But, alas, America could not stand to have good TV on the air. If only L.A.W.K.I were another mindless reality show, I'm sure we'd be watching today.

2287842,5,B0009F43DG,"Life as we know it is a show based on the British book ""Doing It."" Its all about three sex-obsessed teenagers, Dino, Johnathon and Ben.

Dino (Sean Ferris) starts off with everything,a great family,good looks and a beautiful girlfriend, Jackie (Missy Peregyrm)until he makes a shocking discovery, his mom, Annie (Lisa Darr) has been having an affair with his hockey coach that his dad, Michael (D.B. Sweeney) has been kept in the dark about. This little secret turns his world upside down.

Ben (John Foster) starts off with a little crush on his 23 year old teacher, Ms Monica Young (Marguerite Moreau) and is shocked when she returns his feelings. Soon Ben is the only one to have done it and with his hot teacher of all things. But can he deal with keeping everything a secret, can Ms Young deal with how wrong it is and what happpens when someone finds out?

Johnathon (Chris Lowell) is a smart (kind of nerdy) guy who is currently dating Deborah (Kelly Osbourne) and eventually realises that unlike Dino and Ben he just isn't ready to have sex.

LAWKI stars Sean Ferris as Dino Whitman(Sleepover) Missy Peregrym as Jackie Bradford (Catwoman) John Foster as Ben Connor(The Door in the Floor) Marguerite Moreau as Ms Monica Young(Runaway Jury) Chris Lowell as Johnathon Fields Kelly Osbourne as Deborah Tynan(The Osbournes) Lisa Darr as Annie Whitman(Popular) D.B.
