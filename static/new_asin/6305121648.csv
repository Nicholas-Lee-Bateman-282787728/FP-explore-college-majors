7883287,3,6305121648,"""The Loves of Hercules,"" aka ""Hercules vs. the Hydra,"" features the husband-and-wife team of Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield--the former running around, confused, as Hercules, and the latter playing two parts via two hair colors.  As a thoroughly unconvincing Amazon queen, Jayne is murdered by a killer tree, while her good-gal counterpart is saved from a three-headed monster puppet of vast size but limited movement.  Highly bad, but great fun.  In ""Tyrants of Babylon,"" Peter Lupus' mission, should he decide to accept it, is to battles lies, deception, small armies, and sunstroke before literally bringing down the walls of Babylon with a huge underground wheel designed, naturally, for just that purpose.  Lupus (aka Rock Stevens) emotes beautifully, though his voice belongs to someone else, as do those of the other actors.  The dubbing is better than usual for a sword and sandal saga, but the direction is sluggish and the plot nothing but a series of double-crosses and power-plays.  The obvious source, sans sandals, for ""Dynasty.""",982454400,7,1048,5.283132530120482
