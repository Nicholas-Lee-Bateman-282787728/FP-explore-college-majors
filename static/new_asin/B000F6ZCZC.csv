8118264,5,B000F6ZCZC,We saw this immediately before taking a 7 day cruise from Memphis to New Orleans on a paddlewheeler and seeing the film answered many of the questions we had about  the design and advantages of a riverboat plus gave us a good understanding of the history of riverboats and why there are so few at present.,1367539200,,305,4.446428571428571
8118265,5,B000F6ZCZC,I really enjoyed this video. I was stationed on LST-821 67-68. This video brought back many memories. The friends I had on the PBRs and in the Helo divisions.  These guys put everything out there everyday.  There were good times and bad times.  This video was very factual and I found it to be very interesting. I think anyone would like this presentation and these boats and ships doing this type of operation should be among The Geat Ships.,1286668800,,442,4.569620253164557
