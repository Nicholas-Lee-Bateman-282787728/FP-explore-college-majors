1742102,4,B00006CXHK,"NINJA CHECKMATE (aka MYSTERY OF CHESS BOXING, 1979) is a top-drawer work from Taiwan-based kung fu filmmaker Joseph Kuo (18 BRONZEMEN, SHAOLIN TEMPLE STRIKES BACK). It stars Lee Yi Min (WORLD OF DRUNKEN MASTER) as a kung fu student-in-training and co-stars Jack Long as his main teacher and Mark Long as the feared villain, ""Ghost-Face Killer."" Simon Yuen, the old ""Drunken Master"" himself, puts in a cameo as a cook who makes Lee his kitchen apprentice and gives him his first kung fu instruction in a couple of clever (and funny) scenes involving cooking and kitchen work.
Lee undergoes plenty of training in this film, eventually studying both chess boxing and ""5 Elements"" kung fu under Chinese chess master Jack Long (who has a pretty daughter, played by Jeannie Chang). The training scenes are interspersed with fight sequences involving ""Ghost-Face Killer"" and the various kung fu masters he tracks down and kills as part of an elaborate revenge campaign. Ghost-Face's path leads him eventually to the chess master and his student and a final stretch involving three major kung fu bouts, which all involve chess fighting moves like ""Double Horse Attack"" and 5 Elements moves like ""gold cuts wood"" and ""earth absorbs water.""
The expert fight staging is photographed simply and efficiently in wide angle compositions, giving the performers ample time and space to show their stuff, never once resorting to unnecessary cutaways or camera tricks. MYSTERY OF CHESS BOXING is actually a more appropriate title than NINJA CHECKMATE, since there isn't a ninja in sight. This is easily one of producer-director Kuo's finest films, ranking just below his all-time masterpieces, BORN INVINCIBLE and 7 GRANDMASTERS, both of which also starred Jack Long and Mark Long, while the latter film also starred Lee Yi Min. The name, ""Ghostface Killer,"" was later appropriated by a member of the rap group, Wu Tang Clan, as part of the group's ongoing and deeply felt homage to classic kung fu films.",1066435200,6,1986,5.07645259938838
1742103,5,B00006CXHK,"Tai Seng indicates on their website that this film is 'Mystery of Chess Boxing'.  A film that features Mark Long as the Ghost-Faced Killer, MOCB also has some great acrobatics courtesy of Long's brother Jack, and the lead Li Yi Min.  The basic premise of the story is that the Ghost Faced Killer has been going around exacting lethal revenge against a group of men who plotted against him.  Li Yi Min's character's father was one of the victims when he was a child.  While the story and martial arts aren't as engaging as the other Jack Long, Mark Long, Li Yi Min, and Joseph Kuo film '7 Grandmasters', it's still great fun.  Mark Longs repeated round house kicks are a treat to watch.",1049328000,,685,4.491935483870968
7967172,4,B00006CXHK,This is not the first kung fu movie I ever  saw but was hooked on Kung fu after seeing this. It's funny at times and the fights are great! Ghostface is a memorable villain! He  good and he knows it!,1326758400,,198,3.925
7967173,3,B00006CXHK,"I love kung fu movies, this flick included. Ninja Checkmate, aka Mystery of Chess Boxing, stars Li Yi-Min. Like a lot of kung fu films, the plot is the basic son seeks the revenge of father's death storyline, but where the movie lacks in plot, it makes up for its skillful choreography, interesting characters, and kick ass fighting scenes.

The film starts out with a ruthless kung fu master, Ghost-faced Killer, venturing around, bringin' da ruckus battling unsuspecting opponents and killing them with his style of kung fu called the Five Elements, in search of the Chess King, one of the best kung fu masters alive. Ghost-faced Killer used to be a high official until his ruthless practices turned everyone against him. He has those thick bushy eyebrows for that extra flavor of evilness and has an actor in his 20s trying to represent an old grayed master well into his 60s. After each defeat he leaves the Ghost-faced Killing Plate with every victim--kind of like a business card that says ""You've just had your ass pummeled by the Ghost-faced Killer.""

The son seeking revenge starts his training with the very least bit of knowledge in martial arts at a local kung fu school. While he's picked on and given unnecessary chores by his instructor instead of being taught, the cook, played by Simon Yuen (Drunken Master, Old Dirty Strikes Back), who's advertised as starring in the film even though he's in Ninja Checkmate for about 10 minutes, teaches him the martial arts basics secretly.

After getting kicked out of the school, the cook sends him to the Dragon Mountains where the Chess King lives. He teaches his student chess instead of kung fu so he can teach his pupil the virtue of calmness. To master chess you have to obtain ""quick of wit, sharp of eye, first of mind, slow of tongue and quick to see."" And when he finally beats the Chess King in a game of chess, the real training begins. During his education the Chess King teaches his pupil the weaknesses of each of the Five Elements: fire, gold, wood, water and earth. He teaches him the counter techniques that will later come into play at the end of the movie: earth absorbs water, wood can beat earth, gold can cut wood and earth absorbs gold. Kind of like the Rock, Paper, Scissor concept of fighting against the Ghost-faced Killer's Five Elements.

Not so much of an injection of comedy into this kung fu film, but Ninja Checkmate is a perfect representation of an excellent old-school kung fu flick.",1302307200,,2475,4.709006928406467
7967174,5,B00006CXHK,"THIS IS THE FLICC THAT STARTED IT ALL FOR ME. IT DEFINANTLY HOLDS A SPECIAL SPOT IN MY HEART, LOL. NAH, BUT REALLY, THE DUBBING IS CLASSIC, THE FIGHT SCENES ARE AMAZING, STORY LINE TYPICAL, AND THE ACTING ISNT BAD AT ALL. GHOSTFACE KILLAH IS THE MAN. THE BEST EVIL VILLIAN IN ANY KUNG FU FLICK EVER!! EVER!! HAD IT ON A VHS WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER AND ITS THE FIRST KUNG FU FLICC I BOUGHT ON DVD WHEN DVDS FIRST CAME OUT. ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE UNCIVILIZED...",1229644800,,458,4.157303370786517
7967175,3,B00006CXHK,"One of the problems with a good rating on an old-school classic is that people who haven't seen it tend to view the enthusiasm without the benefit of a grain of salt.  If you can lace the reviews with a little skepticism, you'll find a pretty sweet movie behind it.  It's not without its problems:  It's full-screen, not remastered (though considering that, the picture quality is very good), and the fights that don't include the Ghost-Faced Killer (Mark Long) tend to suck.  Luckily there are very few fights without Ghost-Faced Killer.

This movie starts with two good fights and then wallows in unpleasant humor and molasses kung fu for about 20 minutes or so.  If you can get past the 20 minutes, the rest is pretty smooth sailing.  Li Yi Min stars as a young man in search of a good kung fu teacher so that he can take revenge on the Ghost-Faced Killer, who offed his father.  He carries with him a pendant that the GFK left after killing the old man.  He enrolls in a school where he is bullied by the other students.  Then the master kicks him out when he finds the pendant, not allowing the young man to explain why he has it.  The master is also an enemy of GFK.  The time he spends at the school is where the movie sucks as Simon Yuen has a cameo.  He later becomes the student of Jack Long (also GFK's nemesis), who teaches him how to defend against the GFK's 5-Element Fist with some methods of Chess Boxing.

This version from Red Sun is pretty good and will have to suffice until a better one comes along.  Hopefully it'll be in widescreen and actually be titled ""The Mystery of Chess Boxing"", as this movie has NO NINJAS at all.  It features the director and cast from ""7 Grand Masters"", but lacks that movie's consistency, though I think some of the fights in this are a little better.  With an improved, uncut version including the real title, this is a 4-star flick.  How can you not love a movie with such a memorable villain?

7967176,4,B00006CXHK,"Its an Ol Skool flick, its not like these new kungfu movies today is worth buying and watching some pretty good fighting scene throughout the whole movie, so i recommend to buy it.",1198108800,,180,4.484848484848484
7967177,3,B00006CXHK,"I bought this movie, based on hype, and from loving the 7 Grandmasters, which is high art among old school martial arts movies.  The transfer and audio of Mystery of Chess Boxing are not good, but you forget about that after a few minutes into watching this movie.  This is a bit campier than most of the era (and that's saying something).  But the fight scenes are plenty, although not all are of the same quality.  A bit slow in parts, but builds to a great ending.

It's worth the money for entertainment.  Would probably rate it 3.5 stars, rounded down.  If you are a purist, you may want to hold out for a better transfer with original language audio (if such a thing exists).  Or, buy the remastered 7 Grandmasters, which is excellent on all levels above this one.",1195603200,,770,4.45
7967178,2,B00006CXHK,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews I read here but after watching the movie I was very disappointed.

one of the things I didn't like was how the main villain would roll around and strike poses before and during battle (the guy would actually role around in the dirt just to strike a pose, then get back up and strike another pose). in a lot of the fight scenes the moves just seemed impractical and silly to be honest. the acting and kung fu performed by the main character and his rival classmate was just plain terrible and the plot was nothing new. just wasn't very interesting imo.

I wouldn't recommend this movie and doubt I'll ever watch it again. that's just my opinion though, seems a lot of others enjoyed it.",1150329600,3,724,4.395522388059701
7967179,5,B00006CXHK,"When you sit down to see a good kung fu movie, you expect good fighting, revenge story line and comic relief.... its got all that and more.  The talent of the villian is top notch and it's truly a unique film for its blocking of the fight scenes.  There are some new styles the pros will enjoy and a little creativity in the training... Notice that this is one of the first (after the real old school) movies to REcapture the flirtatious values of the ""hero"".  Thers's alot about this flick i like.. let me know how you like it!  PS  the middle fight scene ranks among the best of all time for me!!!! great suff",1122595200,2,611,4.232758620689655

good comes out, you parasites always has to label it as

OVERRATED! Grow up! This movie is one of the best kung fu films

ever made! The fights scenes are excellent! This beats out any

Yuen Wo Ping's or Jackie Chan's or Sammo Hung's films! I'm

shocked that Joseph Kuo didn't go on to greatness like John Woo

or Jackie did! Well, I assume what kill Joseph Kuo's career is

Ninja Kids (aka.. Ninja Death aka.. Venom of the Ninja)! It was

ritualistic for any film actor or film maker that if you did a

ninja film then you're career will end! Well at any rate, next

to 7 Grand Masters, this is Joseph Kuo's best film! WHO NEEDS AN

EPIC STORY!?! This isn't a stupid Shaw Brothers film!

IN CONCLUSION: For those who felt my review wasn't helpful, kill

yourselfs cuz my opinions are facts your exsistence is flawed!",1113091200,2,879,4.385093167701863
