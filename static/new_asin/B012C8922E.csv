7346872,5,B012C8922E,I honestly love the Amazon arc it's one of my most favorite arcs!!!!!I know there's not a whole lot of fight scenes but none the less it's still good! I honestly love romance and the voyage delivers some romantic scenes so I love this arc and I recommended it to anyone!!!!,1441324800,3,273,4.372549019607843
7346873,3,B012C8922E,"One Piece: Season 7 Voyage 3 is basically the rest of the Amazon Lily arc and some minor Straw Hat episodes that end the set off. Amazon Lily, in my opinion, is not an entirely great arc when it's compared to the overly superior Sabaody Archipelago arc where lots of stuff happens. However, with that said, Amazon Lily is still worth watching. Things like Luffy fighting the Kuja Pirates and learning more about Hancock's past are the highlights of the box set and do a decent job to be thematic and interesting as to not bore the viewing experience. One problem with this part of the story is that it can drag at certain points as a means to fill up time, which many have come to expect from this show. Despite that, Voyage 3 is a decent entry to the season which I assume many will enjoy.",1441065600,,790,4.344594594594595
7346874,3,B012C8922E,"I somehow anticipated that the cover of this Voyage was going to look exactly like this.  A highlight of the main battle in the Amazon Lily arc with Luffy duking it out with Hancock's giant snaky sisters.  You don't get too many serious battles in anime where males fight females and this battle delivers nicely.  Marigold and Sandersonia are each about as strong as Rob Lucci was in Enies Lobby and (just like Eneru and his priests in Skypeia) they can predict Luffy's fighting moves.  So Luffy has a really hard time.  The reason why I gave this Voyage only 3 stars is because of the package.  You get a image of Hancock sitting haughtily on her throne watching the fight but you literally need a magnifying glass to see her.  A person as powerful and important (and gorgeous) as Boa Hancock deserves better (she's a Shichibukai for God's sake).  At any rate, you get all of the Amazon Lily arc on this Voyage except for the first two episodes on Voyage 2.  On the last 4 episodes, you finally get to see what happened to the other 8 Straw Hat Pirates after they disappeared from Sabaody.",1440288000,,1090,4.49238578680203

This volumes includes a nice batch of episodes dedicated to a less serious set but next batch are very serious as luffy goes to the rescue but results with a end that badly hurting luffy and us viewers and it is because that's reality we look to help but end up seeing their end instead.",1509321600,,312,4.216666666666667
