6379240,4,B00JLDTAOO,I liked the movie well enough.  I was not impressed with the fact that the wife was always giving and the husband seemed selfish until the end.  The actors played their parts well.  Nancy McKeon is always good no matter what character she plays.  It would make a good family movie with possibly a discussion time at the end on the give and take in marriage for sons and daughters.  All in all a clean family movie.,1438992000,12,414,4.324675324675325
