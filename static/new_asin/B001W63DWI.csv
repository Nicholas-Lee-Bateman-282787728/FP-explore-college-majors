8347000,5,B001W63DWI,Just what my husband wanted to relive the 2009 Championship!  Great purchase!  Very pleased with this DVD and husband is happy :),1358035200,,129,4.818181818181818
8347001,4,B001W63DWI,"If you are a UNC fan, this DVD is a very good one. And not just the outcome, but the quality of the video. It is all game with no commercials. Highly recommend it.",1353369600,,163,3.823529411764706
8347002,3,B001W63DWI,"So the DVD plays wonderfully. Oddly enough when you are at the Menu and want to watch one thing - another thing plays. It's backwards for some reason. All of the footage is on the DVD, it's just not labeled correctly for some reason. It was a little embarrassing when I gave it to someone as a Christmas gift...",1308873600,2,311,4.288135593220339
8347003,1,B001W63DWI,"Never received product although retailer claims it was sent.  When I informed him that it was not received and that I needed it for Christmas, it made no difference.",1261958400,,165,4.689655172413793
8347004,1,B001W63DWI,"I have to agree with the others. This is a sloppy, slapped-together production. You can tell CBS had no interest at in anything other than getting it out the door so they could start collecting money. As others mentioned, the menu is messed up, the ""highlights"" are strung together with no rhyme or reason or commentary and the final game is presented in the crudest possible way, starting immediately on the tip-off and containing nothing at all to set the scene or to follow up beyond the briefest possible presentation of the awards. They don't even include CBS's treacly ""One Shining Moment."" Although the semi-final games are presented in the briefest possible time, at least they contain player and coach introductions that give some flavor for the live telecasts. Finally, the video quality is barely a step above non-HD broadcast quality; certainly not DVD quality. I should have recorded the DVR recording I made from the HD broadcast--it would have been leagues better than this p***-poor production. CBS should be ashamed.",1250985600,5,1033,5.046783625730995
8347005,1,B001W63DWI,"I agree with T. Douglas.  This video is not worth buying unless you are a collector and UNC fan, which I am.  I got it because of sentimental value of this year's tournament.  The dvd has 3 games, the 2 semifinal games and the champ game.  It also has a very short compilation of highlights of the tournament.  This is where it is terrible.  In previous years, CBS would have round-by-round summary of note-worthy games (upsets, close games, etc.) in the highlights section, which would help people relive the tournament in later years.  This dvd's highlight section has no summary, no scores, no introductions, no game reviews, with very minimal commentary.  It had a few slam dunks and long-range shots, and they are so short you can barely tell by which schools the plays were made.  Very poor production.  And then, like T. Douglas said, the menu in the DVD is wrong - it said that the first semifinal game was the UNC/nova game, when we all know it was the second.  And if you click the UNC/nova button on the menu, it actually gets you to the MSU/UCONN game.  Very poor quality control.  Don't buy it unless you are a collector.  CBS should apologize for this DVD and Amazon should complain for us consumers.",1242691200,7,1214,4.586046511627907
8347006,3,B001W63DWI,"I'm a lifelong Tar Heel fan, so I'm delighted that I can get this Championship Game on DVD.

Only problem is, the game wasn't terribly exciting.  I was excited that UNC won the game somewhat easily, but it wasn't a very thrilling game to watch.

Buy it if you are a huge Tar Heel fan (or a fan of any game Michigan State loses), but for others it may not be such a worthy purchase.  Since you already know the outcome, the game itself has to be exciting in order to enjoy it on repeated viewings.  This one wasn't.",1242518400,2,514,4.151515151515151
8347007,1,B001W63DWI,"This is not worth  the money. The picture quality is poor, there are mislabeled buttons in the dvd menu, and there is little on the DVD other than game tape with commercials removed. Aside from the full championship game, and highlight reels of the semi-finals, there is only a bland highlight compilation from the whole tournament.

Compared with championship vids from the past, and in other sports, this is a very poor job by all involved. Do not buy!",1242086400,7,454,4.734177215189874
