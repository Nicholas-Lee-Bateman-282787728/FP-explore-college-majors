6381701,2,B00JMXWQ1M,If you are going to call it a hexalogy you moght want to include 6 movies. I only count 5.,1406678400,11,90,3.55
6381702,5,B00JMXWQ1M,"This is a great package of blu-ray movies to add to your science fiction collection.
The predator movies 1 and 2 are memorable and still classic icons of the saga.
The AvP movies are not as deep in action and suspense but it makes up for what most
have dreamed of for decades seeing predators on the hunt for alien trophies.
The latest predator flick is more about taking earths deadliest animal (man) and
watching what we try to do best, survive the onslaught of their hunting parties.
While they did their best with this revamp of predator you can at least appreciate
the sense of will to live and the human spirit to never give up in the film.
Do your self a favor and get this very affordable $19.99 deal of the day.
 I won't be disappointed I hope you won't be either.",1406678400,17,773,4.3310344827586205
6381703,5,B00JMXWQ1M,"I like Predator and although the last two titles aren't the best, you can buyall  the individual discs for $42 versus today's deal of the day price of $19.99. Not too shabby.",1406678400,16,174,4.4375

6381705,5,B00JMXWQ1M,"I consider this two sagas as my favorite, my fascination for the real Alien life o Predator is wide, so I get this collection to watch with my father, now the movies:
- Predator: This disc is the Hunter Edition so have some interesting features, Multilanguage great sound, but the video quality in some scenes is a little poor, looks like VHS images, it seen that the remaster was difficult to perform in some scenes, besides of that the movie is a must see.
- Predator 2: This movie is the theatrical version so not extras, just the movie, the sound and the quality are a bit better than the original movie, the only thing that I really like they to chance is the acting of Maria Conchita Alonso, I'm also Latin American but this actress is one of the worst for me, her singing career was a lot better.
- Predators: The official remake for the first movie is quite well, some new weapons, more advanced technology to the war, a new and more scarier Berserker Predator gives the movie a fresh beginning. This movie is quite more actual than the others so the sound and video quality are very good.
- AVP: I have a high hopes for this movie and I really thing that this movie could be better in the hands of a more experienced director but besides of that the movie is good, showing the most of the characteristics of the two aliens and a pyramid where this two species used to fight.
- AVP Requiem: No comments about this film is a little bad considering the standards of the other movies, only one, the best parts of the movie are the predator planet (I really wanted to see more of it), the girl on the pool, has an spectacular body and the final part where Mrs. Yutani appears. This is the resume of this film.

I recommended this collection for those who loves this franchise and were a really fans.",1478908800,,1803,4.366071428571429

6381712,2,B00JMXWQ1M,"The film is similar to ""Predator"" except it takes place in the old West and the alien wears armor. A spaceship crashes with two aliens, one that looks like Predator, the other an ET looking fellow. A cowboy (Robert Amstler) with a price on his head comes in telepathic contact with the cute alien who lets him know he must kill the ugly alien or else the world dies. He leaves a diary which is found in the future to create a subplot.

The film utilized CG for much of its special effects. The dialog was boring as were the characters. The ET uses a voice masker and it becomes difficult to understand him. Not really worth watching other than the girls.

6381750,4,B00JMXWQ1M,"I was at first a little leery of the packaging...basically you get 5 Blu-ray cases, each one factory-sealed in the original packaging, but then these cases are shrinkwrapped together.  So, remove the shrinkwrap, then you have to open each Blu-ray title separately to watch.  I was not expecting any pretty case like the Alien Quadrilogy set, but I also was not expecting this.

At the risk of echoing what other reviewers have already stated, I have not watched these yet but here are my initial remarks about the packaging of each individual title, in their franchise-release-date order:

Predator (1987) - front cover shows ""Ultimate Hunter Edition""
Predator 2 (1990) - nothing special to comment on
AVP Alien vs. Predator (2004) - front cover does not indicate this, but the back cover shows that this has both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie.
AVP Requiem (2007) - front cover shows ""Extreme Unrated Set"", and back cover shows that this has both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie.
Predators (2010) - this is the one that has 2 discs (and why this listing is boasting a 6-disc set, as the other titles only have one disc each), the second disc being a digital copy.

So to summarize: 5 movies, 6 discs total.  And for the DOTD being $19.99 (at time of purchase), brining each title to around $4 each, this was a good deal.",1407196800,4,1356,4.72457627118644
6381751,4,B00JMXWQ1M,"This is literally just the 5 Blu-rays that were sold separately plastic wrapped together.  It isn't a reprint, no large sleeve to hold them all, the spine labels aren't perfect matches.  This is fine for me, but a Predator/Aliens fanatic might find that unacceptable (it isn't like the pretty presentation of the Alien Quadrilogy).",1407110400,,331,5.111111111111111

8652543,5,B00JMXWQ1M,"This is a review of the bundle not necessarily the review of the product within the bundle.  Saying that, I am glad I picked this up when it was offered as a Lightning Deal.  I like Predator but not nearly as much as I have enjoyed the Alien franchise.  I know it's supposed to be cool to cross over, but it's not my cup of tea - meaning, AvP and AvP Requiem I could easily have lived without.

The bundle includes all five Predator movies.  Each one comes in its own case and they are all taped together in a bundle.  I am much appreciative of that as too many groups have come in cardboard liners where are horrible to the discs.  (My Torchwood collection has two discs that are scratched just taking them out of the folder.)

The transfers are fine, the audio great.  Subtitles are available and I use them.  If you enjoy the Predator collection, this should be a one stop shopping trip for you.",1488585600,3,898,4.291666666666667
