The 3 leads are also fun and cute to watch.  The big problem is this movie seems to only be available as a Region 3 (Asia) DVD.  Unless you have your DVD player set permanently to Region 3, this won't play.  It is available on Youtube, but I sure would like to buy it.  :-(",1344124800,,483,4.206521739130435
8600527,5,B004HHG6PK,"This movie is a very touching, feel - good movie. It's about misunderstanding and finding love from that. I don't have a way with words. It's just a GREAT movie and worth the 37 bucks for A Multiregion dvd player.",1322784000,,213,4.35
