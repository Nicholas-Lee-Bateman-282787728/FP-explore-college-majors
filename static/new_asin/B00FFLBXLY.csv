5990574,5,B00FFLBXLY,"Note: I see this is listed as a ""Import"" but it is , in fact, a US release by Eagle Vision. - NOw on to my review
Oh to be Cliff Richard when I get to be the age of 72 (not there yet but not THAT far away). Based on this two hour concert, recorded at the Royal Opera House in Sydney Australia, this former rocker from the UK (now more of a pop singer  looks at least 20 years younger. (Yeesh, even with the sharp HD close-ups of his face, the guy looks GREAT!)

The first thing you notice being different from most concert DVDs when you press play, and the concert begins, is that the audience is completely SEATED. Yes, no one is standing at the edge of the stage. Maybe this is the way they do things in Sydney (who knows) but the audience was obviously told to stay in your seats.  With a majority of Richards fans being middle-age=plus females, you can see the looks on their faces as they move to the music while staying seated, wishing only to be on stage with their idol.
All Richards big hits are there as well a four or five from a new album he was planning to record (after the tour) in Nashville  mostly covers of US pop hits from the early 1960s (Johnny Tillitsons Poetry in Motion; Bobby Darins Dream Lover). He has two guitarists who can also dance to back him up, and a one of the female backup singers gets to duet with him as well.
The bonus material is a 20-minute featurette which consists of interview footage with Richard, his stage manager and costume designer, recorded BEFORE the concert, in which he talks with the folks in Austraulia and New Zealand about why he loves playing there.
Those reading this here in the US may only know Richard from his film appearances but certainly know the songs. If you enjoy the recent DVDs of concerts by Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka and the pop/not rock side of Paul McCartney, I think youll enjoy this. Richard certainly maintained his health and body better than the late Elvis Presley, who was his competitor on the charts in the early 1960s.

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.

5990579,5,B00FFLBXLY,"As usual, Cliff Richard puts on a stellar performance and sings a catalog of classic songs. I'm always amazed at how much energy he puts into his shows. At 73 years old, he's still giving it all he's got.",1399420800,,204,4.256410256410256
5990580,5,B00FFLBXLY,I'm giving may age away here but I first saw Cliff perform in 1958 at Butlins holiday resort in the U.K. Now living in the U.S. I have followed his career since Devil woman. Why he is not a STAR in the U.S. beats me. I was impressed with the rawness of his singing back then and now by his polished performance. I am not sure how he does it but wish I had his secret. His singing is fantastic and the video is technically the best I have ever seen of ANY pop singer. He still has his voice and a way with the ladies in the audience that has them eating it up as if he was God himself. In the past some of his CDs and videos have been deplorable but this is probably the best ever.,1398297600,,680,3.8642857142857143
5990581,5,B00FFLBXLY,"Cliff does not come to Canada ? Therefore the Sydney DVD was just like being there. I am amazed that he still performs so well.
I loved it.",1397692800,2,139,4.0
5990582,4,B00FFLBXLY,"I love anything by Cliff Richard, however, I would have preferred more of his rock 'n roll material, seeing that the title has ""Rockin'"" in it.  Overall, still a good dvd and well recommended.",1393372800,2,192,4.647058823529412
5990583,5,B00FFLBXLY,Seen the concert multiple times (including the one on this DVD) and LOVED it. This DVD has captured the concert perfectly. It is full of energy and fabulous songs.

5990584,5,B00FFLBXLY,"This artist and DVD is awe inspiring. Years ago I won a talent contest singing Cliff Richard's ""Living Doll.""  This man is in his 70s and his voice is stronger then ever.  The  variety presented in this concert and the professional video and audio will continue to bring our family hours of nostalgic joy. Thank you.  We are grateful.  wls",1393286400,,339,4.583333333333333
5990585,5,B00FFLBXLY,"Why did I chose the rating?, because it was a brilliant show, everything proffessionaly done, from stage setup  to lighting, choreography and great backing band, as well as Cliff,s presentation, he,s still got it.  What did I like/dislike?.  It was all likes no dislikes, selection of songs was great, and seing the audience swinging and singingalong  .  Who would I recommend to?.  Pretty much anyone who likes good ole rock n roll  and Cliff.",1389916800,,444,4.918918918918919
5990586,5,B00FFLBXLY,"Next to actually attending the concert in Sydney, Australia, this DVD is fabulous. Arrived very quickly and packaged well. Quality of DVD is amazing and the content is superb ....especially if you are a Cliff Richard fan. I have followed him since 1960 and he still is ""huge"" in the entertainment business. This keeps my personal collection up to date so ""nice work Amazon"".Thanks",1389916800,,380,4.953125
5990587,5,B00FFLBXLY,Fantastic the show was absolutely wonderful and the DVD is great to watch sing and dance along and relive the shows time and time again.  Cliff is the best,1389312000,4,155,4.344827586206897
5990588,5,B00FFLBXLY,"On time, excellent concert DVD, it is amazing how he keeps going strong past 70 - and both he and the fans just seem to enjoy the experience",1389052800,4,140,4.035714285714286
5990589,5,B00FFLBXLY,"This Blue Ray Disc is outstanding. I grew up with Cliff in England, (he is only 4 years older than me). The show was one of the best performances I have ever seen from an artist, especially one in his 70's. Sir Cliff Richard (OBE) has been performing since the early 1950's spending 10 years recording the The Shadows. I was a little concerned that The Shadows were not backing him for this concert but need not have worried at all. The music arrangements, choreography and overall performances by both Cliff and all the other artists was superb. I recommed this Blue Ray Disc to both youg and elderly even if you've never seen Cliff before. Enjoy!",1388620800,,648,4.547008547008547
5990590,5,B00FFLBXLY,"Great singer of all time .. every thing Is perfect ..musicians ...backing vocals..sound engineering

I wished if they used real Violins instead of  Keyboard",1388620800,,168,5.0
5990591,5,B00FFLBXLY,"It is everything I expected of Cliff""s music. Five stars for the co who sent me the item. All around very satisfied",1388188800,,115,4.2727272727272725
5990592,4,B00FFLBXLY,"As others have already pointed out, Cliff still looks and sounds great at 72 and has a lot of energy.  This concert looks and sounds wonderful.  It is actually filmed in 1080i so it is not ""full"" HD but the picture quality is very good.  Best of all is that the sound is in DTS-HD Master Audio as well as an LPCM track.

I love that Cliff has recently added ""Devil Woman"" back into his sets and that's included here.  Most of his biggest hits are also here but my biggest disappointment was that there are too many cover songs.  I realize this concert was supposed to help push his latest CD of the ""Fabulous Rock and Roll Songbook"" but I don't want to hear covers from a man with a fifty year career.  I wish Eagle Vision would release a U.S. version of the recent reunion show with The Shadows on Blu-ray.",1388188800,,807,4.235294117647059
5990593,5,B00FFLBXLY,Cliff is still really rockin' and reelin' at over 70. He sings new songs and the favorites in this Blu-ray concert.,1385424000,5,115,4.523809523809524

8615324,5,B00FFLBXLY,"I have several of Cliff Richard's DVD's, and so far, this one is my favorite.  He is very active in this, and seems to have so much fun, as do his back up singers (all very nice to look at, too).  They are sooo synchronized in their movements, yet seem loose enough to enjoy the gig.  A very  energized musical experience I highly recommend.",1498089600,,341,4.28125
8615325,3,B00FFLBXLY,"As much as I love Cliff Richard, his voice sounds very tired in this concert. Ironically, his voice is still better than his backing vocalists who are decades younger than him. Still very entertaining but clearly not Cliff Richard's finest moment.",1485216000,,247,5.048780487804878

8615327,5,B00FFLBXLY,"Cliff Richards is by far the greatest pop rock male vocalist of all times. He can cover any song in almost any range and he has total control of his voice. Cliff is totally amazing! This bluray proves it. Great sound, great band, great vocals, great production and solid song selections. Don't delay in buying a copy of this bluray or DVD. It will not be available forever. You simply cannot do better than Cliff when it comes to pop rock music!!",1456272000,,446,4.451219512195122
