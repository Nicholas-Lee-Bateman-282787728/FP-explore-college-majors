8235630,2,B000ZJ2ZM2,There are no English subtitles for the hearing impaired. I felt it was too sexually oriented - maybe they did that at the beginning of the episodes to catch one's interest but I found it more annoying. The premise of the show sounded good. I came across it by accident. I started with the second season as it was MUCH cheaper than the first or 3rd seasons. Yannik Bisson (Murdoch Mysteries) had a guest starring role in one episode. The show is supposed to take place in Florida but says it is filmed in Israel. One episode seemed a bit gross when they fished a man's head out of the water. not my cup of tea,1483833600,,608,4.25

8235635,4,B000ZJ2ZM2,Positive memories from yesterday. I wish the show had lasted longer. It's a pity they never shot a Christmas episode.,1387584000,,117,4.9

8235637,4,B000ZJ2ZM2,"I loved the actors, catchy tunes, easy to watch series. Received with no defects. The box got broken while in the mail. A little dirty but not too bad, better not to watch around kids.",1361750400,,184,4.285714285714286
8235638,5,B000ZJ2ZM2,"Bought this dvd strictly for the episode ""Last of the Magnificent""
with Clint Walker. I've been a Clint fan since his ""Cheyenne"" days.
In this 1993 episode he was older & out-of-shape, but still an
attractive man & an imposing figure. I enjoyed the show & will
watch it over & over. Well worth the purchase.",1261526400,3,307,4.5
8235639,5,B000ZJ2ZM2,"I loved this show when I was young! It was called Sweating Bullets when it aired every week after the 11 o'clock news. I stayed up late every week to see this show. The lead actor Rob Stewart was not only hot and sexy looking, but also a great actor. He brought a realness to his character Nick Slaughter! He was so believable as a private detective. I just loved him! The show had a lot of sexual overtones to it, but not so much that it makes you sick. The partnership between Nick and Sylvie, was a joy to watch. They made a great team! If you love the old late night TV detective shows, you'll love this one. It has everything: drama, romance, action and comedy. It is just a true gem!",1255392000,4,689,4.149253731343284
