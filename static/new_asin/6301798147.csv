369971,4,6301798147,"I have not read the Tom Wolfe essay this story is apparently based on, but as a film it works quite well.  Jeff Bridges, looking like a rougher member of the Beach Boys, is effective as a young guy from a small-town moonshining family, who decided he's going to take the world by storm as a champion driver.  Great supporting cast includes Ned Beatty, Gary Busey, and Valerie Perrine.  Kind of a cross between Monte Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop and Rebel Without a Cause.  And understand that you don't have to be a NASCAR enthusiast to enjoy the film - it's just a great drama.",1163462400,3,577,4.519230769230769

Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors of all time, and I was elated when this movie finally became available on DVD.  Great story, great cast, great theme song (""I Got A Name"" performed by Jim Croce).",1142985600,6,486,4.5
369973,5,6301798147,"This is 5 stars if you are a true race fan. Otherwise, it's still an interesting story. This film is loosely based on Tom Wolfe's essay about the younger days of Junior Johnson, although for some reason they changed his name for the film. (Notice, though, that Junior himself was a paid racing consultant on the film.) The race footage is very well done and there is some good footage from the old Southern 500. Bridges and Busey are a lot of fun to watch together as well. If you like stock car racing and wonder what the old days were like when the sport was still developing, you'll love this film. Only pity is it's not on DVD.
(Also another great film (although a little cheesy) about the old days is 43 The Petty Story starring Darren McGavin as Lee Petty and Richard Petty as himself AND Dale Inman AND Buddy Baker!!! It is a classic look at the old values that are still carried forward in the sport to some degree. It also has some insight to what NASCAR was and what it has become..Some really good vinatge racing footage is also included.) Also a pity it's not on DVD...We need to prolong the life of these smaller ""special interest"" films. Anyway have fun, great summmer stuff.",1056758400,35,1189,4.433789954337899

370277,4,6301798147,"Recently got tagged pretty hard with a slew of unhelpfuls when I lodged my entry to the Steve McQueen film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Mans/dp/B004R6JG7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Mans</a>'. Apparently having hit a nerve, aka The Emperor Has No Clothes Penalty, by zealous fans who don't appreciate pointing out the contrived and rather poor construction of the movie.

Included in my reply to those who protested or neg'd the review, I noted this film as a benchmark for car racing movies. And having done so, I should step up to the plate and execute one that supports my position. It's important to note that I'm not actually a race fan per se. As a cinephile I review movies, not necessarily the topics which are being presented. A good film is a good film irrespective of whether it's about racing cars or watching snow melt. Bottom line: Can the artists craft a compelling and interesting product?

'Hero' tells the true, but fictionally updated, story of Junior Johnson - one of the first stars that helped form the entertainment juggernaut that is today known as NASCAR.

Based on a series of fascinating in-depth articles written by Tom Wolfe of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Right-Stuff/dp/B000092T6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Right Stuff</a>' fame, the film opens with a bootlegger and his two young sons. The older of which displays an exceptional skill at driving, learned while avoiding liquor enforcement authorities. As we're introduced to the character, first impressions are that he's callous, unrepentant and supremely arrogant. Interestingly, he's also an obedient and good son whose only goal in life is to support his family. A complex individual who shares both repellant and admirable traits, reflecting a cinematically creative depiction and therefore a more honest film portrayal.

Junior's skill is only exceeded by his mule-headed desire to never lose under any circumstance. By caroming like a bat out of hell through the backroads of Appalachia, he's earned a reputation for being impossible to catch. Even though well-earned, it's a reputation he takes an inordinate amount of pride in - and one that his humble father dislikes and fears. Prophetically, his son's recklessness and brash behavior eventually comes at a very high price. Having pissed off or on just about every officer in several counties and several states, the frustrated and angry authorities instead target his moonshining dad, making him pay for Junior's excesses.

With the loss of their primary bread winner, it's now up to the boys, and Junior specifically, to help the family farm survive. But not being half the 'shine producer of his dad, turns to the one thing he does best - drive. Drive really fast. This despite an offer to work as a general mechanic; steady employment that would provide stability for himself and his languishing mother and little brother.

Deeply conflicted about which fork in the road to take, he reaches out to his father in prison. As they get past pleasantries, talk quietly moves to life choices. His dad reveals a core belief with great hesitation, given that he's offering advice while sitting behind bars: ""Damn foolishness for one, is breath of life for another"", in response to why he kept going back to the stills instead of settling down in the lumber yard. Chagrined and fearful, his mother realizes Junior's free spirit refuses to take the safe path.

The die is cast.

But is Junior as good as he believes? Can he handle the world beyond the dirt roads and pine trees?

While there are some weaknesses in the underpinnings of the screenplay, orphaning some plot threads, 'Hero' is an engaging drama; exploring life beyond the track and examining the complexity of one young man's unquenchable desire to always be in victory lane. A solid film that does more than stitch together action scenes with a thin single plot thread. One that delivers much more than a straight biography - the filmmakers delve into the pursuit of self-discovery.

Finally, my very deep appreciation to Valerie Perrine's performance playing damaged pass-around party favor Marge. Her sad tormented past explaining her character's low self-esteem is revealed only near the end of the film, adding an unexpected depth I didn't see coming. And as a cinephile, I love it when I'm caught off guard.

Movie Notes:

- Surprisingly, 'Appalachia' includes New York State.

- It's not overtly stated in the film, but Junior's younger brother played by Gary Busey is, I believe, autistic. Explaining why everyone expects Junior to do the right thing - settle down and get a steady job, while not expecting the same from Wayne.

Personal Notes:

- Quick props to a pair of veteran character actors whose talents added to this film's quality by virtue of their performances. William Smith, while mostly known for bit parts as strongman and thugs - is fondly remembered by this fan for a scene-stealing performance as a Russian Spetsnaz Counter Insurgency Officer in the classic '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dawn/dp/B000PMFS14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dawn</a>'. And one of my favorite character actors, Ed Lauter, whose roles are spread across several generations, holds a special place in my library as a hilarious FBI Agent in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rocketeer/dp/B005JZBP4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rocketeer</a>'.",1342310400,3,5525,5.460726846424384

370280,1,6301798147,I object to the title and the subject.  I watched it and have watched it. My opinion has not changed from the first time.  He is not a hero.  Hero's do selfless things that save lives or at least help others endangering or causing their own death.  The Medal Of Honor is and example.  He was self serving.  He's a convict.  Did he rob from the rich to help the poor?  This movie has abused the word.  The Idolizing of such people is one of the reasons this country is on the decline.  The laws against moonshine are for a reason.  There is no quality assurance.  Will they us an old radiator as a condenser or have god knows what in the mash.  I know about it.

If you like Jeff Bridges .... and auto racing, car chasing, and auto sports, it's a fun movie.

The bonus, was Valerie Perrine.  Not the greatest part for her, but she can always attract me to buy an inexpensive film, with her in it.  She was so hot!

Junior Johnson is an excellent driver and ends up racing cars at the track to keep the family afloat. Good acting by Jeff Bridges, Gary Busey, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, and the rest the cast. Fine directing by Lamont Johnson and good story and consulting by Tom Wolfe. Worth at least a rental, but if you enjoy NASCAR movies this probably should be added to your library.

Perspective folks, this is a low budget film showing what transpired almost 20 years earlier (rather than when it is portrayed) in bringing the Junior Johnson Racing Team together.  Racing movies are difficult to pull off (and the better ones are ridiculously long in duration) and subsequently this movie suffers from that arduous degree of racing genre difficulty (while compressing the screen time) and still brings a respectable amount of entertainment for me - especially when my narcissistic interests keep pushing me through the watching of the flick. Lots of local folks shown, a lady that worked for my father is shown biting her fingernails - her husband a former race car driver. Lots of nice folks used as extras in the crowd, announcer, track owner, photographers, the list goes on an on - fun to see your small hometown race track featured in a film.

7816023,3,6301798147,"The Last American Hero is decent movie with lots of familiar faces from the seventies. The HD aspect is nice and it was fun to see a seventies film that captures the era just as I remember it.  Versions of Jim Croce's ""I Got A Name"" I hadn't heard before are featured and are very welcome treat. It's not the best, but it's a great little time capsule to transport you if you grew up back then like I did.",1462233600,,405,4.0625
