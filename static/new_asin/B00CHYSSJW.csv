5722324,4,B00CHYSSJW,"This movie was extremely powerful and well-acted - the stress and dread building to the end carries the movie past its minor plot failures.  Years ago, I watched ""Waiting for Mr. Goodbar"" with three people in a movie theater and we all agreed to forgo dinner plans and go straight into another movie playing at the same theater - ""The Deep"" - just to wipe out the effects of ""Goodbar"".  For the first time since, I had to immediately watch something else after ""The Silence"".  So, if you plan on watching it, watch it early enough in the day to do something else afterward - it is that disturbing.",1375660800,7,597,4.458715596330276

5722329,4,B00CHYSSJW,"Generally speaking, a field of wheat is a field of wheat; nothing more, nothing less. However, in the realm of crime thrillers, such benign rural locales can harbor ominous underpinnings (""Memories of Murder"", ""The Onion Field"" and ""In Cold Blood"" come to mind). And so it is in ""The Silence"", a low-key, quietly unsettling genre entry from Germany. In the hands of Swiss-born writer-director Baran bo Odar (who adapted from Jan Costin Wagner's novel), a wheat field emerges as the principal character; an unlikely venue for acts running the gamut from the sacred to profane, as unfathomably mysterious and complex as the humans who commit them within its enveloping, wind-swept folds.

A flashback to the mid-1980s, involving the disappearance of a 13-year old girl, whose abandoned bicycle is found amidst the aforementioned waves of grain, sets the stage for the bulk of the story, which begins 23 years later with an eerily similar incident at the same location involving a girl of the same age. A team of oddly dysfunctional homicide detectives (several of whom worked the former unsolved case) sets about to investigate. However, Odar quickly discards standard police procedural tropes by revealing the perpetrator to the audience long before the police figure out who it is. Interestingly, this narrative choice echoes another German crime thriller (arguably the seminal German crime thriller), Fritz Lang's ""M"". And, just like the child-murderer in Lang's film, this is a monster hidden in plain sight who walks ""among us""... personifying the banality of evil.

Putting the ""mystery"" on the backburner allows Odar to focus on the aftermath of tragedy. The loss of any loved one is profound; but the loss of a child, especially via an act of violence, is particularly devastating to surviving family members. In that respect, I was reminded of Atom Egoyan's 1997 drama, ""The Sweet Hereafter"". Like Egoyan, Odar deep-sixes Cause and makes a beeline for Effect, peeling away the veneer of his characters like the layers of an onion, enabling his talented ensemble to deliver emotionally resonant performances. Consequently this haunting film is not so much about interrogations and evidence bags as it is about grief, loss, guilt, redemption...and an unfathomably mysterious field of wheat.",1374537600,20,2295,5.2506811989100814
5722330,5,B00CHYSSJW,"there are two murders of young girls which take take more than two decades apart. we see the first one committed. the murderer had said to his horrified friend that he had figured out what he was from seeing him watch children. he starts pandering to his interests in friendship and then one day rapes and murders an eleven year old while his friend is along.  the pedophile friend takes off and disappears and the murderer returns to being alone. over twenty years pass and then another young girl is killed in the same field and the same way.

this murder mystery is so much more than another murder case or pedophilia tale.  it is a long meditation on being alone and alienated. youcan  be so twisted from this aloneness that you even sporadically take up perversions, like pedophilia, just to stop being alone, you decide that having a pedophile as your friend is better than having no friend,

we are all conditioned to believe that themguy watching child pornography on his computer at home is the most dangerous person out there.  however, many of these people only watch. it is very chilling to realize that loneliness can be a darker and more lethal condition by far.

this is very well done and it has been on my mind constantly since i saw it.

as an aside, apparently young european girls alone on their bikes on solitary or back roads feel a lot safer than their counterparts do in america. it is hard for me to imagine an american eleven year old girl riding her bike down deserted roads or at night in empty streets. yes, back in the 1950s it was done here but not in 1986 or 2013. if it is being done here, the parents would be deemed neglectful. not so in europe apparently.

This German film is outstanding, bringing together the elements of crime investigation, murder mystery and grieving parents to make a film that is filled with tension.

5722333,3,B00CHYSSJW,"Baran Odar has crafted a mystery with a distinctly mainstream, by-the-numbers feel. A German language film with a thoroughly American film aesthetic. The performances are just that--performances--'off' and standardized. The pacing is rushed rather than organic; checking off plot points while relying on a conventional, obtrusive score for the mysterious atmosphere the functional pacing cannot deliver. Nothing kills a movie quite like over-scoring, especially if the music drones on without individuality. Here it is laughably obvious and over-determinative. Rather damning for a mystery, and deeply ironic for one whose title is synonymous with the absent of noise. The whole thing is a bit cerebral and plays like your standard TV crime drama, making immersion elusive. Even Wotan Wilke Mhring, an actor with magical eyes and real screen presence, feels like he's performing and fails focus this diffuse mess of mystery.",1430352000,,924,5.607142857142857
5722334,4,B00CHYSSJW,"Here we go down that road of a suspense thriller again, thick with a wonderful mystery that keeps the viewer guessing on just what is the ultimate truth and reality. This is a stylistic film. It's a film that plays with the viewers mind making them guess, making them fathom, making them contemplate just what is the truth. It makes you ask ""How will the mystery unravel""? It has all the landmarks of a crime drama that holds the viewer until the final showdown.

To start with, two men, July 8, 1986. This movie does not hold anything back, not even four minutes in and you have a brutal scenario and a disturbing display on screen that makes you realize just what you're getting into.

The idea of pedophilia. The idea of child rape, the idea of human monsters and they're disgusting reality. I think what's so shocking about this film is you automatically know who the bad guys are. You automatically know what the incident is, because it displays it and you see what happens in 1986.

A young girl 11 years old, named Pia is raped and murdered. You then flash forward to 23 years later. You're introduced to a young girl named Sinikka, a rebellious little girl. Also you are introduced to Elena the mother of Pia. Also you get a Detective named David who just lost his wife to cancer.

David is introduced to the cold case of Pia, by the former investigator Kirschan. Soon on the anniversary of the 23 year old murder Sinikka goes missing. Her bike and gym bag and bloody rock is found in the same spot as Pia's bike was.

This is a crime thriller that sticks with the viewer long after it's over. The performances are brilliant, the dialogue is stunning, the emotional reality and the horrible shocking nature of the subject matter does play with you at times.

5722335,5,B00CHYSSJW,"The Silence is a film with a far different aim than most mysteries or thrillers.  Its story, of course, is troubling yet brilliant enough: The movie opens with the rape and murder of a young girl 23 years ago, in a normal yet eerie wheat field.  The film will maintain the same subtly haunting air to it, with a patient soundtrack and slow, careful pace, as it has in that opening scene, which I found only more disturbing for that reason.  There's no blaring music here or considerable cliches.  It just happens, right in your face, and it really is disturbing.  Then the story jumps ahead to the present time, when the same thing happens to a young girl in the same field, and a troubled detective begins investigating, and the families of those involved--as well as the two individuals directly involved with the original murder--are affected by what is happening.

The title of the film has many meanings, and comes to a very unsettling conclusion that I won't give away here.  The Silence won't satisfy someone looking for a fast-paced suspense film, but the film-buff or fans of such films as No Country for Old Men, Terribly Happy, Prisoners, etc, will find a masterpiece that handles its heavy themes with grace and art, and uncompromising patience.

Are there worse things than having committed the act itself?  That's the question this film seems to ask, among many others.  I highly recommend it for someone looking for a film that is both troubling, disturbing, and will leave you in a kind of quiet shock.  It's brilliant.",1418256000,2,1535,4.754716981132075
5722336,5,B00CHYSSJW,"This movie about a child murder and subsequent disappearance of another child in the same location 23 years later is a slow paced but very effective and emotional experience.  Since I can only understand English (and need subtitles when viewing foreign movies), I don't view a lot of foreign films and am usually amazed at how much I enjoy the ones that I view.  I think it's because they are usually slower paced, character driven and have an interesting take on the human condition.  This is true in this movie as every character in the film (the perpetrators of the crime, police, grieving family members etc.) is very interesting and deep, to the point where I wanted to know even more about them than the two hour film allows.

Without giving too much away, the story itself is interesting with a few twists and an ending which is clear but may affect viewers in different ways.",1414627200,3,883,4.641025641025641

5722341,4,B00CHYSSJW,"Other reviewers have compared The Silence to the AMC series The Killing, and that's accurate. I'd add that it also fits in the mold of movies like The Pledge (with Jack Nicholson) and the more recent film Prisoners (with Hugh Jackman).

If you're a fan of disturbing and bleak crime drama, this is a must-see, unless you're not fluent in German and can't stand to read subtitles.

This being bleak drama, the good guys aren't guaranteed to win, and all sins won't necessarily be punished. Part of the entertainment and frustration of The Silence is that, as the viewer, by the end you'll know all (or most) of the secrets, while the characters still grapple with the unknown. The movie is good at bringing closure to you, so you won't feel cheated, but you may feel bummed out.

There's not much to complain about other than the movie feels a bit long (a full two hours) and some of the characters seemed lost in translation. The tortured police officer (a staple of bleak crime dramas) acted almost cartoonish at times.

What was most interesting about The Silence was that without advocating the criminal behavior the movie showed that not only does the victim suffer, but the perpetrator (or perpetrators) aren't having a great life either. Even if the criminal escapes civilization's justice, they are still doomed to torment by their very nature.

There are some very deep themes here, told slowly. The Silence isn't a film for a light movie night, but if you want a mystery that takes its time to unfold and rarely lags, then The Silence is for you.

5722346,1,B00CHYSSJW,"First, this film is nowhere near as intelligently and deftly written or directed as The Killing.  Long pauses in dialogue, silence, and agonized vacant staring into space are often the tools of lazy and pretentious film making.  Bergman and the Coen brothers (Fargo) could do ""unspoken"" right.  Not this director.  The endearing idiosyncratic cliches are out in full effect; a practically autistic scruffy detective who, oddly, gets sent out to deliver the news of a child's death to the parents.  A pregnant and sweetly cautionless detective.  ""I'm just asking people if they are a homicidal pedophile, guess I will sit and eat cookies with a potential suspect at his place like I really care about his cookies.  And if he gets up in the middle of my discussion of a recent child murder, I will let him get out of my line of sight and then turn my back to where he went.""  If you can't stand cheap plot devices, unlikely behavior, and obvious emotional manipulation, stay away from this movie. The Silence uses long pauses (silence) in dialogue to communicate anxiety and hesitation.  I am guessing that the director thought that this was a profound way to underline the title and theme of this film...the 23 year silence of one character about a crime he did nothing to stop.  The movie  dangles the ridiculous possibility that the viewer could develop empathy for one of the pedophiles.  We get lots of shots of his face communicating his tortured moral struggle.  I did not care that he was struggling with his urges...he was as guilty and grotesque as his more ""active"" partner in rape and murder.  My reaction isn't an emotional response, it is basic to character development.  There is no reason in the film to find Timo (the ""nice"" pedophile) any more worthy of forming an attachment to--other than that he has a family, whereas the ""bad"" pedophile doesn't.",1382227200,3,1865,4.802507836990595

5722348,4,B00CHYSSJW,"****1/2

Based on the novel by Jan Costin Wagner, ""The Silence"" is a fascinating, beautifully realized crime drama from Germany.

The movie centers around two identical crimes, both occurring at the identical place, though 23 years apart. Both involve the murder and possible rape of a young girl biking alone through an isolated meadow.

The script by Baran bo Odar examines the case from the viewpoints of the perpetrators, the victims, the victims' families, and the law enforcement officials who have some pretty intense psychological issues of their own to deal with. The life-shattering impact on the parents, along with their inconsolable grief, the frustrations of the investigators, the remorse and guilt (or lack thereof) on the part of the criminals - all are woven into a rich tapestry that mixes crime-and-detection elements with generous dollops of morbid psychology.

The most interesting character is Timo Friedrich (superbly enacted by Wotan Wilke Mohring), an ""accomplice"" to the initial crime and a prime suspect in the second, who has so many inner demons of his own to account for that he has become utterly consumed by feelings of guilt and self-loathing.

Unlike in the typical American police procedural, the investigators here are not played by drop-dead gorgeous movie stars but by frumpy, slightly saggy and balding middle-aged performers who look like actual honest-to-God people you might encounter in real life. And all are excellent.

In addition, the movie doesn't cater to the audience's desire for a clear-cut resolution, and in so doing, acknowledges that life does not always work out the way it does in the movies.

Odar's direction is both spare and slightly surreal at times, so that the world he's portraying always feels strangely off-kilter, as befits the subject matter.

A triumph for all concerned, ""The Silence"" is easily one of the best movies of 2013 thus far.",1380672000,5,1908,5.172077922077922
5722349,5,B00CHYSSJW,"We open onto a nondescript German apartment block - it's not Bauhaus, but it is a near thing. The shot tightens, drawing us into the repressing geometry and then closer still, into a plain door with a tiny peephole. We cut to a spinning, caged fan, and then a slowly rotating projector wheel.

Inside a dark room, two men are viewing movies of an unsavoury kind.

In a startling aerial shot, the mundane is rendered extraordinary: a square early '80s model Audi reverses out of a tight row of parallel garages. Again, constrained by the geometry of the everyday: the car, the pavings, the garages.

All of this is casually symbolic of the immutable boundaries of lives, our ordinary constraints and the blinkered paths on which we must run. There is even a hamster in a cage. It doesn't run on the wheel: it tries forlornly to escape, biting frantically at the wire. What is more, these establishing shots call to mind the familiar, shared dilemma: the private urge to overcome this linearity: the inevitability of all things. You might as well run, hamster: there's no better alternative.

This is a film about individuals battling their private urges; trying vainly to escape the irrepressible geometry of their lives. It is a film about the stultifying human architecture which forbids it.

Of course, there are good and bad ways of self-overcoming. We realise we are observing two individuals who do unspeakable things. Their bond is not close. From above we watch them go about their business, in their square car, proceeding dully along a ramrod straight blacktop, populated either side by a verdant forest. They turn off the straight path to a deserted lane by a cornfield, in pursuit of a young girl on a bicycle.

The most uncomfortable scene, in a film full of them, comes in this opening sequence where we see the girl's ghastly fate. One of the men is Timo, a mathematics student. He sits mutely in the car, only a witness to the murder. Quickly, he quits the town, horrified by what he has seen and his passive complicity in it. The perpetrator, Peer Sommer, pleads with him to stay, but even here the regular mechanisms of life - in this case a departing bus - contrive to frustrate him. Timo forges a new life. The men fall out of contact.

At the scene, all that remains is the girl's discarded bicycle, some Walkman headphones and her bag. We learn her decomposed body is recovered some weeks later at the same lake.

We roll forward twenty three years. Timo has found a more constructive way of grappling with geometric and structural constraints that life presents: he is an architect. He has changed his name, married and has children.

Then, back in the original town, history repeats itself. A young girl goes missing, her cycle and bag are recovered at the identical spot. (There is much made of this possibly being a coincidence: surely, whatever it could be, it couldn't be that). Timo's simmering guilt, and his long-suppressed urges, pull him back into Peer's world. Also drawn in are the police investigators, the disappeared girl's parents, and also their correspondents from the original case: the murdered girl's mother Elena, and the now retired detective on the original case, Krischan, who was unable to solve the murder.

The remainder of the film, with the odd flashback, charts the unravelling of this case, though to characterise this as a police procedural (or a thriller) would be to understate the engaging psychological and metaphorical study that Baran Bo Odar, in an assured debut, brings to the screen.

We track Elena as she jogs through the woods, on her own treadmill: a daily routine of visiting her daughter's grave. She keeps her daughter's bedroom as it was on the day of her disappearance: she too has had trouble overcoming. Her opportunity to break with the past comes in the unlikely form of Krischan, newly interested in the case following the disappearance, and in this way also striving to overcome. There is a more primal draw between the two: In a scene strikingly resemblent of Dracula, Krischan raps on Elena Lange's shutters and scratches at her window, as if he were a vampire unable to pass without an invitation. Elena lets him in.

This latter exchange leads one of the few difficulties of the picture: characters occasionally act in incomprehensible ways, as if they are motivated by the requirements of Odar's metaphorical scheme, and not their natural narrative arcs. Krischan and Elena's interaction seems neither plausible nor really necessary: there is rather more relationship breakdown and inter-marital confusion than is strictly necessary to make the point.

Indeed, the cast of characters between them have as many afflictions as you could ask for: aside from the paedophiles there is a grieving, borderline unhinged police investigator, his pregnant police partner (who is left to enter the wolf's lair single-handedly, Agent Starling style), disfunctional but underdeveloped parents of the missing girl, and a bureaucratic, small-minded police chief who resents both the visionary weirdo chops of his star investigator and his offhanded treatment by Krischan, his predecessor.

The Silence's thriller is tightly strung and astutely paced. Odar never allows the melodrama to dominate, and we are left with a stylish, sombre and rich film, which absolutely refuses to compromise its ending for the sake of neat resolution.

As the curtain falls, the picture is book-ended by the same oppressively symmetrical shot on which it opened, and it is clear that, in this story, there have been no winners or losers - the only winner is the inevitable machinery of modern life.

And the viewer of this thoughtful film.

It is definitely a very strong and intense subject, we had to watch a happier film after this. But if you're in the mood something dense and for an interesting storyline, give it a shot. The description does not says it all..",1516147200,,391,4.226666666666667

8581908,4,B00CHYSSJW,"Bleak. Mad bleak, but I knew that going in. Reviewers and ciritics on other sites describe this film as among the best in the ""bleak horror"" subgenre - a category I've only recently heard of. I would agree with those reviewers' assessment of ""The Silence,"" it is beautifuly produced and acted. It's painful to watch but engrossing nonetheless. Certainly not heavy on action, but not slow in the least. Great character development, and universally relatable themes set the stage. But I think what sets ""The Silence"" apart is the the writer's/actors'/director's ability to not only engender humanity in those capable of committing some of the vilest acts known to our species, but to do so without allowing the viewer to lose touch with the consequences of said acts.

We feel the exponential ripple of horror affecting so many of the characters lives, we react to the visceral idea of 'what if happened to me/us/my child?' without which the humanized (to varying degrees) perpetrators would become antiheroes. I love a good anti-hero story, don't get me wrong, but something like, say, Pulp Fiction (to me among the greatest anti-hero movies),  invites and requires a level of escapism neither possible nor valuable to a story depicting these kinds of crimes or the tendency to commit them.",1485475200,,1289,5.018691588785047
8581909,1,B00CHYSSJW,"This movie was stupid. I read the ""stellar"" reviews and how ""this movie is such a masterpiece... it creates a stillness throughout the whole movie, with the camera viewing the scene over a plain field""  I'm sorry but I cannot appreciate the art or whatever you want to call it, in this movie. Boring, dull and not a good movie to watch.",1485388800,,336,4.419354838709677
8581910,4,B00CHYSSJW,"Baran bo Odar's film begins almost wordlessly on a sunny day in 1986. Two men driving along in a red car (Ulrich Thomsen, Wotan Wilke Mhring) encounter a young girl riding a bicycle (Helene Doppler). They pursue her into a cornfield where one of the men rapes her, kills her with a blow to the head and dumps her corpse in an adjacent lake.

Fast forward to 2009, and one of the two men (Mhring) has become a successful architect, married with two children, while the other (Thomsen) works full-time as a caretaker. The memory of that traumatic occasion haunts both of them, creating a complicated web of lies, deceit and implication that leads to the murder of another young girl (Anna-Lena Klenke).

The film's title not only refers to the silence practiced by the perpetrators of the original crime in 1986, but also describes other people's state of mind. For twenty-three years the murdered girl's mother (Katrin Sass) has kept silent about her harrowing ordeal; likewise the police inspector (Burghart Klaussner) who was involved in the original investigation but failed to achieve a result. It is only after this lengthy time-lapse that they decide to come out and voice their feelings, as well as trying to reconcile themselves to what happened in the past.

Shot in garishly bright colors (by Nikolaus Summerer) creating a world of apparently endless summer weather that nonetheless appears highly dystopian, THE SILENCE offers an insight into the pedophile mind, which often thinks it is doing nothing wrong, even while taking a perverted pleasure in watching child porn videos. The film also takes a look at the ways in which such people are allowed to flourish in societies that prefer to turn their collective backs on such unpleasant issues in the belief that everyone is fundamentally well-intentioned. bo Odar's film proves precisely the opposite; it is often the outwardly most respectable people that prove the most dangerous.",1463788800,,1944,5.031055900621118
8581911,4,B00CHYSSJW,"Being the parent of two children, this movie bothered me to no end. I just wish they had caught the man who really killed those girls. Even though the other man committed suicide, and he had witnessed the death of the first girl, it's too bad he hadn't informed the authorities of the true killer, who was still among them. I wish the ending had been different. There both families thought the true killer was dead.",1457222400,,415,4.473684210526316
