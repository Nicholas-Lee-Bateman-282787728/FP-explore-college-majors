7914738,5,B00001U0DY,"I grew up watching this Saturday Morning television show. I never missed an episode. You could say I was glued to the tv set. It was my favourite then and it still is today. H.R. Pufnstuf still remains one of the best children's programs ever made. It has everything. Great costumes, a fantastic set, lots of color, talking puppets and brilliant actors. This television program can definately hold it's own against any Saturday Morning program today. I had a chance to watch some of the episodes once again when Pufapalooza aired on Nick at Night. So when all 17 episodes became available in one boxed set I ordered mine immediately.  For those of you who grew up watching this show it will take you back again. For those who have never seen it... Well, what are you waiting for?  I highly recommend this item.  And if you like this item, you will LOVE the motion picture ""Pufnstuf"". Chris",978393600,14,889,4.613924050632911
7914739,5,B00001U0DY,"What can I say?  I grew up watching this show as a little kid (10 years old)- and I haven't seen it in 30 years.  While I understand some episodes can be viewed on cable- having this whole set is a real treat.  As an  adult (with small kids), I can enjoy the true silliness, stupidity, and  creative expertise the Krofft brothers brought into their creative works  all at once.
You can't go home again, but, with these tapes, you can  sure come close.  A very enjoyable set of memories to re-live!
Although  the set may seem pricy- it really comes to about 3 bucks per episode.  Not  bad at all.",962928000,28,595,4.27027027027027
