There is a store in NY claiming that 70% of its sales are to non-Asians, therefore there is a greater non-ethnic purchase power here.  This edition of ""Lawyers"" is probably good in Region 1 because it's the MSNBC version played on TV in New Jersey.  Subtitling on those is also good. However, should we take the chance at that price that it IS region 1?",1184889600,2,501,4.483516483516484
8106887,4,B000E6S8WC,"KIM SUNG SOO was so good in this series. His acting was so deep and so real. We can feels his pains deep down inside in heart. HAN GO EUN also so good in this one. She makes Jung hye Young looks so boring, BORING!!! Besides JHY, everything else was good. The story line, the actors and every twists and turns in LAWYERS will make you cry your heart out.",1170547200,,353,4.057142857142857
