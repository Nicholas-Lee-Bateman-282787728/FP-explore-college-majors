Yes the story is basically the same but one thing that truly shines is the animation. It is of a high end caliber which helps bring the characters to life.

Something that I feel I must clarify is the price. This item is an import of Japan it contains a soundtrack of the movie and couple other things. Everything included is of a really top notch quality like a collectors item should.

Therefore the price tag is worth of the product you are buying. Also this is the first movie the second one is on its way and it seems to be even better than the first.

I would highly recommend this movie for both fans and not fans alike it does a great job at introducing the cast that we know and love and it remains faithful to the source material and in doing so it brings back to memory the hours I spend on the game.",1403222400,7,1003,4.128205128205129
6260427,3,B00IE4QTYK,"If you've played Persona 3, then you already know the story. Basically they took the beginning half of Persona 3 and made it into a movie and it's pretty good. What i don't get is why the movie is nearly $100 for the Blu-Ray. Would be 4 stars if the price was lower.",1401580800,2,266,4.037735849056604

8641436,5,B00IE4QTYK,"Much like the game, this first part of a span of movies does an excellent job to portray the story of Persona 3. Furthermore you receive an interesting interpretation of Minato (or as the movie refers to him as Makoto) and how he chooses to interact with his fellow SEES members and others around him. As far as quality goes, no doubt the visual and audio quality is up to acceptable standards. A note that I would like to add is that it's Eng Sub, some people who are not fully informed may not know this, and it's always good to at least put that out. I would like to add more about the movie, but if you've played the game, I'd rather let the story unfold upon itself to the viewer, and if you are new to the Persona series, you can expect and excellent treat tosses your way.",1426550400,3,779,4.2

8641438,5,B00IE4QTYK,"Before purchasing this film you need to understand that this is a movie based on persona 3, it isn't a comprehensive overview like P4 the animation. Whether that bothers you or not if subjective, but I think it made this film much better than the P4 animation.

This movie is about as good as any adaption gets. The pace doesn't feel rushed, it flows well and humour is lightly sprinkled into the story much like the game. The movie only follows the main plot so most of the side social links are excluded (not sad to see hidetoshi go) and the dark nature of the p3 plot is amplified. As well as this the symbolic elements are moved to center stage at times. These (in my oppinion) are all good changes for a film adaptation, and allow the movie to become its own thing, rather than just another persona spin off.

My one real gripe with the film was that if you hadn't previously played a persona game (which you don't have to to understand the movie) things can get confusing, especially if you to aren't into symbolic and psychological films.

That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and absolutely recommend it to any persona fan or anyone who enjoys dark, deep and symbolic movies. Overall, a great movie.",1414972800,3,1220,4.536363636363636
8641439,3,B00IE4QTYK,"First off, LOVED the movie!!! Absolutely loved it! But the reason I give this only 3 stars, despite me being a huge Persona 3 fan, it wasn't the Limited Edition. Even though I looked at others reviews saying they got it with the soundtrack and other stuff, which I really wanted, I didn't get it. I felt like I got ripped off cause I paid $88 for a  $50 Regular version when I clearly wanted the LIMITED EDITION!!!!! I can't put most of the blame on them because it's my fault as well for being careless with my money. I was kinda disappointed that I didn't get the Limited Edition, but I did get the AMAZING MOVIE, that's in my opinion, a great piece of art!!! Guess this purchase wasn't all that bad.....",1406505600,5,706,4.30827067669173
8641440,5,B00IE4QTYK,"Did you know that there exists a secret hour in the world, known only to a select few? It's known as the Dark Hour, and in this hour, creatures known as Shadows roam the bloodstained street, eating anyone not protected from this secret night. Those special few, armed with their ability of Persona, fight against these enemies of humanity as they try to unravel the mysteries of the giant structure known as Tartarus. In the center of all this is the boy with the ability of the Wild Card, Makoto Yuki. He has signed a contract, and he is unwittingly following it every step of the way..

Honestly I think I give all the anime I review 5 stars. Goes to show how much I love them I guess. Anyway, for Persona 3: Spring of Rebirth I didn't actually buy it on Amazon, but rather RightStuf as they had it for cheaper. It arrived promptly, and I started fangasming as soon as I saw the beautiful box. With Makoto Yuki taking front and center, the back of the box had the haunting words Memento Mori against a dark blue background. A chilling reminder to those of us that know the fate of the Persona 3 cast, as well as to humanity in general. The box isn't too big, a standard size for most collectors editions, but really I don't know why but it just feels amazing.

As for the contents, it came with an artbook with beautiful storyboards and models, the movie soundtrack, an English translated booklet of the round-table discussion, a few postcards or artwork I've yet to open because they look amazing, and what appear to be stickers handed out to patrons who bought tickets to see the movie in Japan. This was all packed in an amazing boxset worth less than 100 bucks, so I find it extremely worth it for any Persona 3 fan.

With the movie itself, it's presented in Blu-Ray goodness, so on my setup it just looked incredible. The voice actors all seem to have taken great pains to become their character, and they gave Yuki a personality that made me want to hug him. In the movie Yukari would rather have punched him but we all can't stand her so who cares. Kidding...a bit.

Spring of Birth covers up to the second level of Tartarus, namely the acquisition of SEES' information expert. they don't show the painstaking grind we all took in the game, and I suppose it's better that way, as there is a lot of ground to cover in just four movies. The general cast is introduced, with the story focusing more on Yukari Takeba and Junpei Iori. Mitsuru Kirijo and Akihiko Sanada are of course there but they take more of a backseat to the relationship shared between Junpei, Yukari, and Makoto.

There is a lot more I want to say about this movie, but just know they stay pretty faithful to the game. The calender moving every day (or weekly...), Junpei's problems, etc etc. I wish the other three were out so I could watch them and squeal with delight, but I have to save that for another time. Next up is #2: MidSummer Knight's Dream.",1405036800,3,2930,4.438661710037175
