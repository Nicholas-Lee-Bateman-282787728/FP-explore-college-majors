3851263,5,B002650ANE,"I liked everything about this movie from the brilliant acting, direction, cinematography, script, editing and, of course the music. Dury was a tragic figure in many ways, rough and raunchy and wild with a ""unique"" singing voice. Actually, he always said he was more of an entertainer than a singer. His hit songs were great fun. Like most Americans, I didn't know much about his life. This film gives an inspiring view into the mind and music of a man who became a star despite his polio disability and his hellish childhood, not to mention trying to be a good father to his children, especially his son. He had two woman at the same time who both loved him and were both loved in return; they knew about each other and helped each other try and cope with the rebellious life of ""regular bloat who put on a wild, wonderful shows and made some unforgettably fun hits that were totally different from the other music of his time.",1325980800,,927,4.523809523809524
3851264,5,B002650ANE,"Low expectations for the movie but intrigued due to a second hand store acquisition of Ian Dury's greatest hits and reliving my UK youth. Well, brilliant acting, especially from Mr Serkis, different direction and an irreverent direction that matches the London scene of the period. Won't win an Oscar but should win loads of plaudits. And in the words of Mr Drury 'there aint alf been some clever b######' - well a lot of 'em made this film. Watch and enjoy!",1319846400,,458,4.666666666666667

3851266,1,B002650ANE,"A biography on cockney, handicapped, original ""Stiff"" recording artist Ian Dury, a forgotten but loveable writer of ""sex & drugs & rock & roll""? Sounds enticing for a music historian and lover of rock music like myself... especially of New Wave, a genre from my formative high school years. Unfortunately, I hated this movie!

This film is practically unwatchable.

It is too stylish, too daring and plays like a wild, MTV/Duran Duran music video to properly act as any kind of cinematic biography. I'm all for a director taking bold chances but Ian Dury's story should outshine the manner in which his story is told.

This one was an unnecessary [way too much] style over substance.",1302739200,,683,4.870689655172414
3851267,4,B002650ANE,"I'm a fan of the music, but never knew anything about Ian or the band.  It was interesting and well made.",1301443200,,105,4.0
3851268,5,B002650ANE,"Though I was a teen and young adult in the 70s and 80s, I don't remember hearing about Ian Drury during that time until after his popularity had started to fade.  Very intriguing movie.  Clearly, Ian Drury had a great talent for music and composition.  I fear his greatest downfall was his inability to get his personal life in order.  His distraction in trying to keep some order in his personal life kept him from truly devoting the attention needed for a successful music career.  Sadly, he could not gain the respect in his field that was deserved.

As far as the movie goes, I felt much like I did when viewing ""La Vie en Rose"", the story of Edith Piaf.  Constant battles with demons within kept our principal from reaching his potential.  Fast moving and full of life, this movie keeps your attention by the wonder of what the next scene will bring.  I recommend it.

Finally, though the movie makes mention of him, he truly does not receive the recognition he deserves for his performance as Ian Drury's son.  Bill Milner does an outstanding job in this movie and is clearly an up and coming actor to watch in the near future.  He does a great job in this role and you cannot help but empathize the difficulty of a young boy trying to find some normalcy in his life with a bunch of craziness going on around him.  I look forward to seeing him in future films.",1299369600,2,1366,4.416
3851269,5,B002650ANE,"I can't say as I remember this being released in the cinemas, so it sure took me by surprise seeing it on DVD. This is one heck of a romp.

I knew a bit about Ian Dury but not much. I knew the songs of his that managed to garner some air time and I knew he was afflicted with polio as a boy, but that's about the extent of it. Watching this movie was like walking into Ian Dury World. What an unbelievably colorful character. And what a great way to present him in a movie.

I'd seen ""Ray"" and ""I Walk the Line"" and I enjoyed them enough, but they look entirely pedestrian compared to this. Here is a movie about a rock star and it contains very little footage of him making, recording or performing music. It's about him. Who he is, how he thinks, his bad sides and good sides. He's bright and imaginative and he's almost always ""on."" It occurred to me that he wasn't really a musician at all but an artist that expressed himself through music. They make note of the fact that he always needed someone in the band to help him write tunes.

The movie itself is a hoot. It captures the time perfectly. It's goofy and adventurous, with a lot of funny, wild 'sign of the times' nuances in art, fashion and.......music.

The performances are generally good as well. Olivia Williams is gorgeous as ever and turns in a fine performance as Dury's wife. Naomie Harris is good as the girlfriend. But the shining star is Andy Serkis. He steals the show. I liked his portrayal so much I wanted to call him up and have a beer with him.

There is nothing I didn't like about this movie. It's a wild and fresh approach to the genre and could probably be enjoyed by someone who doesn't even know who Ian Dury is. The production values are good. I had problems understanding some of the dialogue but I'm not certain if it were in the production or the thick accents. But this is a minor quibble compared to all else it has to offer.

If you need a real shot in the arm, this might do the trick for you.",1296259200,8,1986,4.213157894736842
3851270,5,B002650ANE,"I would go so far as to say this is one of the best pictures about rock 'n roll that I've ever seen in my life -- believable portrayals, including by great kid actors, psychological study, sweep-you-along mis en scene, busy but in the right way visual effects that slow down when you need to slow down for emotional impact, just plain smart filmmaking. Ian Dury, especially at this late date, is an all-but forgotten but absolutely key figure at the dawn of punk, outside of it but a part of the ethos. He was a pub rocker or something like that who hit zeitgeist with the title tune and many other odes for outsiders and the disaffected. His story is told with warts and all. You root for him but you see his faults, and he knew he had them. Outsized character, rebel, misfit, polio victim, bad husband and boyfriend, loving husband and boyfriend . . . complexity, which is so rare in the broad brush bio-pics we get here in the states. Dury's relationship with his son is best of all. Seek it out.",1279756800,4,999,4.376344086021505

3851294,5,B002650ANE,"Being a long time Ian Dury fan, I have wanted to see this movie since it came out.  I didn't see it being screened anywhere in the USA though, not unexpected.  Andy Serkis does a great job of portraying the ever so loony but absolutely intelligent Dury.  The other characters (Kilburn's and Blockheads) are well portrayed also.  The film is very arty and lots of fun with some great live performance reproductions.  Musically it is excellent, obviously as various Blockheads play on the soundtrack.  It covers a short time in Dury's amazing career from Kilburns to his Blockhead stardom as well as his wild life and that of his, at times, unfortunate family.
I enjoyed it immensely.",1422144000,,682,4.786324786324786
3851295,3,B002650ANE,This seems like it should have been more interesting.  I always wanted to learn more about this dude but this documentary reveals little.  It's fairly entertaining but you get the feeling they were shooting for the stars but fell short.,1416873600,,236,4.875
3851296,5,B002650ANE,Andy Serkis is absolutely brilliant in this. His portrayal of Ian is amazing. The kid actors were pretty good too. You don't see to many kid actors that good. I will have to buy this movie.,1414627200,,189,4.277777777777778
3851297,4,B002650ANE,"This is a bio movie that tells Ian Dury's story warts and all. It does not relent for a moment. I appreciate the honesty this film portrays and gives us a good indication of what Ian Dury was all about.
At times it is a sad story that really has an impact on me. His disabilities, his issues with his family, his children and the impact he has on them is all portrayed here for all to see.
Strangely there is not as much music as I expected but the few songs that are included are accurately performed as what Ian Dury was famous for. I always loved Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick. I was a 10 year old at that time but I loved the amazing music and Ian's powerful and forceful vocals.",1413676800,,683,4.066666666666666
3851298,5,B002650ANE,"How to tell the story of a larger than life musical personality? If you're a fan of Ray, Walk the Line, Get On Up you'll see similarities in the narrative--childhood trauma, unstoppable ambition, mind-altering substances, helpmates and helpers, great musical numbers, use of flashbacks. Sex, Drugs, and Rock n Roll is a kaleidoscope offering time shifts, change of dimension and place, to great effect. Go along for the ride. What is little recognized or acknowledged,  Ian Dury did not create himself in a vacuum. He was as influenced by English Music Hall entertainment as was Paul McCartney. If you haven't, make it a point of seeing The Entertainer starring Laurence Olivier. Oh, and Andy Serkis is on par with Olivier. His Ian Dury portrayal is superb.",1409616000,,757,5.007936507936508

3851300,5,B002650ANE,"Andy Serkis is a great character actor, and is completely believable as Ian Dury, a UK punk rocker. Ian Dury was one of my heroes as a teenager for (probably literally!) spitting in the face of people who treated disabled people as less than human.  His track ""Spasticus"" (think Sparticus) was a celebration of the UN international year of disabled persons in 1981, and was banned in the UK.  The UN distanced themselves, and the track was probably not played on commercial radio anywhere.  Growing up disabled, like Ian did, it meant a lot to me personally.  This film had very limited theatrical release in Australia, and it was awesome to find it available as a rental on Amazon.  I was going to title this review ""I'm Spascticus"" but decided I would prefer to have you read it!

The movie not a documentary, including animation and fantasy, and jumping back and forth in his life.  The title refers to one of the more well-known songs from Ian Dury and his band the Blockheads, referencing ""sex & drugs & rock & roll"" as the consolations of the working class (yes, the title of my review is taken from that song).

The actors playing Ian's wife and his girlfriend were believable, and it was good to see two strong women in the film. It would have been good to have given them more screen time.  Ian's relationship with his son is central to the movie, and is frequently contrasted with the relationship between Ian and his father. I found myself wondering about his father and why Ian was left in a ""home"" for disabled children (or ""crippled children"", as we were known back then).  Parents of disabled children in the 1960s (in Australia and the UK) were often advised to put their kids into these institutions, but it wasn't universal.  His mother is not present at all, and I wondered about her.

The movie doesn't try to gloss over Ian's destructive behavior, typical of the time and place.  To say he had flaws is understating it.  Yet it's quite uplifting, ending with ""Reasons to be Cheerful, part 3"", which bounces along quite nicely.",1384300800,2,2047,4.634349030470914

8351935,5,B002650ANE,"This is a great story that adds a little background to the larger than life character that was Ian Dury. It covers the period from the late 60s with the Kilburns through to the Blockheads (early 80s) and also provides a lot of detail on his relationship with his son Baxter and his amazingly patient wife Betty and lover, Denise Roudette.
I followed his work from his early hits with the Blockheads and he was so ahead of his time. How ironic that the banned single, Spasticus Autisticus, should be used for the opening of the 2012 Paralympic Games in London -  would he have chuckled at that, who knows?
As other have said, Andy Serkis does a great job of portraying Ian and the art /music hall style of the film with flashbacks works to let us see a little of what made him what he was - Magnificent!",1487376000,,802,4.346666666666667
