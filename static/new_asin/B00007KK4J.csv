1819111,3,B00007KK4J,"I really liked the Texas documentary, their music and energy live in concert was really very engaging to watch--it suited their music much better than a CD where they come off sounding kind of amateurish.  The 60 Odd Hours in Italy documentary was sort of funny too, and not too difficult to get to.  [...]The outtakes within the Texas feature were better than any of the bonus stuff BY FAR!!Wish they had just stuck to the main feature which was quite energizing and entertaining.",1053302400,2,481,4.714285714285714
1819112,4,B00007KK4J,"Before tossing this one in the trash, know that there is an easier way to access the extras.  Delightful and funny documentary of a very decent bar band.  Crowe's voice isn't Pavorotti, but it is passable, especially on songs meant to rock.  Not cracked up with his balladeering, but there is an interesting rap type track of a little song called ""Nowhere"".
Now to those harder than hell to get to levels.  DVDs like Texas have titles and chapters.  Most DVD player remotes come with a display button.  Hit the display button and navigate the titles starting with 1 then 2 and so forth through 20.  It is a very easy way to get around this DVD without going through all those inane instructions.  I really don't know who's idea the levels were, but they must have been in some sort of dream state.",1051401600,19,797,4.486111111111111
1819113,5,B00007KK4J,"Loved the glimpse into behind the scenes...TOFOG definitely rocks the house...sounds like they need to be experienced live to be appreciated fully...although trying to get to all the different levels of the DVD was quite a challenge, I'm sure ole Russell is laughing....but the frustration was well worth it...after viewing this can't wait to see them live!",1048723200,5,357,5.280701754385965
1819114,5,B00007KK4J,"Boy I was really surprised when I started watching this dvd how much I liked it and the band. I am kind of a newbie when it comes to TOFOG but I must say after viewing this that I really like this band. The dvd is very entertaining and enjoyable and it really lets one see the real individuals involved in a way you would never get to experience
unless you saw a concert and it does not just focus on Russ but on all the members! Highly recommend to get anyones spirits up! lots of laughable scenes and good music...A+++!!!
VERY GOOD!!",1046822400,3,535,4.203883495145631

1819116,4,B00007KK4J,"This is quite the fun little DVD, an odd cross between the computer game Myst and the rockumentary, Spinal Tap. Having not been terribly impressed with the band's last cd release, ""Bastard Life or Clarity"", I was pleasantly surprised to see energized performances contained in this enterprise. The band is loud, forceful and nearly always on tune, and when they're not, the fans at the taped live performances are there to drown out the errant notes.
That said, I've never had to work so hard just to get to the end of a DVD. The promise of hidden videos kept me listening and watching, over and over again, to the same tracks in order to ""drill"" down (can we say Freudian?) through virtual layers of ""rock"" (yeah, yeah, we get it- sex and rock and roll, the grunts are clearly masters of the pun) to get to those videos. The gamesmanship in me came out as I became determined to locate every one of the hidden tracks, even traveling to [gruntlands site] for clues on what order what tracks needed to be played to get to the next layer of hidden files. The journey was worth it though, as a number of often crude, sometimes hilarious, and otherwise highly entertaining moments of the band's life on tour and in the studio emerged.
Then I got tired of working that hard and figured out the obvious way (geesh what a dummy I was) of how to locate the last few hidden tracks. All in all, this one is well worth the cost and effort involved in enjoying the grunts.",1044316800,5,1460,4.451492537313433
1819117,5,B00007KK4J,"A cleverly made, multi-layered dvd that will leave you happy, perplexed, frustrated, and enthralled.  Once one gets past the awe of seeing the Grunts unbared you will want to start drilling down in the dvd to see the hidden gems.
The narrator, Reverand Billy Dean Cochran, does a great job filling in the blanks.  Russell, while an integral part of the group, is not the main focus and that is what makes this dvd so refreshing in that it isn't just an homage to Russell.  Other members of TOFOG give some impromtu talks with the camera but does Stew Kirwan really exist? LOL
I was fortunate to see the Grunts in Chicago, 2001.  Thank God I didn't have to stand in line in the Texas heat for 5 hours.  The Grunts are an experience that needs to be had.  If you can't make a concert, this is almost as good.
Cheers",1044316800,7,813,4.3509933774834435
1819118,5,B00007KK4J,"If you love TOFOG, Russell Crowe, Garth Adam, Billy Dean Cochran, Dave Kelly, Stewart Kirwan, Dave Wilkins, you absolutely MUST own a copy of this DVD, since not all of us get to see them on tour, even if you do, you can live the excitement, musical talent, and a lot more through viewing this. The style of cinematography is true documentary, multi-angle option is superb, well-edited, a very frank honest portrayal of the group members the way they are and behave, and the way they interact with each other as well as the audience. Music is undeniably fabulous. You also get to view a couple of ""out-of-print-song"" music videos, such as Photograph Kill; which are priceless considering it is almost impossible to buy these CDs anymore. One annoying fact about this DVD is that-there are multiple levels to explore; termed drill deeper to unlock, but to access some of these levels, you have to go through all the required steps, once unlocked/access granted, you can view them, but the next time around, you are still denied direct access, it doesn't stay unlocked. Also, if you made a code entering error while trying to get there, you have to start these steps all over again from the beginning, quite inconvenient. Enough said, this DVD however is: Worth the price in platinum. Buy it and ENJOY!",1043971200,6,1300,4.782222222222222
1819119,5,B00007KK4J,"I was fortunate enough to see TOFOG in concert in 2001.  This DVD truly captures the concert experience, except for standing  5 hours+ in the Austin heat.  TOFOG is a great live band, and the dedication,musicianship, as well as geniune friendship these men have for each other really comes through.  I appreciated the fact that the band did not attempt to make Russell Crowe seem perfect and let him be seen in an honest light.  People new to TOFOG will also enjoy the Australian videos included.  They illustrate the difference in norms between our cultures.  It is $.. well spent.",1042588800,13,582,4.76

1819130,4,B00007KK4J,"This video is great as far as the music and an eye-opening backstage view of prepairing for a concert and making & a video while simultaneously starring in a major motion picture. Its only drawback is the ""layering"" technique for additional material. It is distracting from whatever portion you are watching to be on the lookout for little symbols that tell you to ""drill down"" for something else. There is also no listing to tell you what the other layers are so, even after watching it many times, I'm still not sure if I've missed something. They should have just done a normal index to everything. Still and all, Russell and TOFOG rock!",1357689600,,640,4.672566371681416

1819136,1,B00007KK4J,"You can't just plug this DVD in, kick back and enjoy. No, instead it contains several different levels that require a code to access. How asinine is that? I couldn't get any of the DVD to play because even the first level required a code and of course codes aren't provided. This band is way too arrogant and mediocre to waste your money on.",1103673600,,341,4.34375
1819137,4,B00007KK4J,"I believe I am  quoting part of what Russell Crowe said from this absolutely entertaining DVD. This is a message I am borrowing to say ""Just Chill"" and enjoy the work in tyring to access the many levels of this DVD. ""This is a Drill!!""

I thought this DVD was entertaining, fun, a good time and a lesson in the hard facts of life.

I love the opening part with Billy Dean Cochran's introduction and the train passing by and the music to it just captures the moment. This DVD like TOFOG's songs tell a story. That to me is a very important ingredient in making music...The band members (like many others out there!)all worked very hard to get where they are...and this DVD well expresses that point.

***Total FUN and total ENTERTAINMENT***in this ""TEXAS"" DVD is my honest opinion.

I kind of expected a full concert film, which unfortunately it is not. But then again, the backstage footage, photos etc. make it so much more interesting to watch. Also, there's quite a number of singing actors or acting singers around, but Russell Crowe really is amazingly good at both and that is a rare combination indeed. An absolute must for fans, but probably not good for converting those unaware of this side of his artistic live. The DVD is a good decade old already and I do wonder if he would still get away with all the smoking today, though...",1369526400,,698,4.503937007874016
