4687172,2,B005G3O4SU,"I was a bit desperate for something to watch and after reading the first review I didn't listen to that voice in my head telling me there is no way it's worth the $2.99 to stream it.  The acting is bad, which doesn't really bother me, but the writer tries to put every haunting clich it can into the film without rhyme or reason. There is no logic to the story as it unfolds and the end is very disappointing. It resembled a bad student film. If this had been for free I still would have been disappointed.",1357516800,2,506,4.163265306122449
4687173,4,B005G3O4SU,"Because of its miniscule budget, this modern-day ghost story relies more on its script and actors to deliver its shivers. And, on many levels, it succeeds at doing just that!

The old Lyndora Hotel in Lyndora, PA, (an hour outside of Pittsburgh) creates a very creepy and atmospheric setting. The script (by Jackie Druga) is solidly plotted; and, for the most part, the actors turn in credible performances (most notably, Norm Wash as ""Father Mulligan"" and Katrina Rogers as ""Katie"").

It's not a perfect film (the pace slows down a bit too much in a couple spots); but overall, it holds your interest, and is a nice change of pace from the blood-soaked/psycho killer dreck of modern horror films.

If you're looking to curl up around the campfire (or TV, in this case) with a good old-fashioned ghost story, you can't go wrong by opening up ""19 Doors!""",1345507200,11,853,4.75

8471047,1,B005G3O4SU,"Grace (Natalie Bail) is a screen writer who gets into her work. She is staying at the abandoned and haunted Lyndon Hotel in Pittsburgh for writing inspiration. There was a series of murders there, one in each of the 19 rooms, although we only get to see a few.

The acting wasn't there and the low budget aspect showed. The make-up was even bad. Looks like an 80's direct to VHS film.

8471053,3,B005G3O4SU,"This is a bit stronger in all respects than many of the amateur-level films I have seen.  It starts out slow but intensifies as it goes along.  It is spooky rather than gory (well there is a little brief goriness, but mostly implied rather than shown).  You do have to be open to tolerating the bumbling bits, but it does have a few startles and some humor.  It reminded me a lot of old C-level haunted house type films.",1459641600,,420,4.2784810126582276

Even the child actor, portraying a ghost was having a hard time not laughing! Don't be suckered in by what looks like a good story line. Amazon should refund money if a movie was not watched due to its' suckiness.",1404777600,,354,4.101449275362318
