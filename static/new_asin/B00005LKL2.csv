7944060,1,B00005LKL2,"This tape seemed like it had been recorded over. There are bits of Cailou and random bits of a random show that I have never heard or seen of.
Since this tape was like $1, I guess thats what I get for ordering something cheap.",1352246400,,226,4.044444444444444

7944062,5,B00005LKL2,"My son just turned four and has been watching Caillou movies for quite some time now. He still loves them all. ""Furry Friends"" is his favorite. Caillou is a typical 4 year old and my little boy relates to it. He gets fixated on the video and I can feel good about him watching it because they're all learning experiences.
You won't be disappointed.",1045958400,4,348,4.453125
7944063,5,B00005LKL2,"My toddler is 27 months old.  She adores ""all things Caillou.""  It even tops Elmo and Barney in her mind.  This series is kind of like Leave it to Beaver for the toddler set.  Very goofy to the adults but very appealing to the little ones.  This video is pretty much just a tape from the series, but I still highly recommend it.  My cutie asks for it every day and is mesmerized.",1016064000,8,379,4.123287671232877
