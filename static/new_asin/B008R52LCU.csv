8529873,4,B008R52LCU,"My rating is primarily for the overall value of the three movies on the BD (and overlooks the limited audio options and lack of extras, as this is a budget pack, after all). If I were rating the quality of the presentation of the movies included on the ""bonus"" DVD, this release would get no stars!

First off, note that this is an unusual package in that three of the movies (Bravo Two Zero, Driven to Kill, and Super Cop) are on a blu-ray while the others are on a DVD. As noted in the tiny note in the bottom left corner of the cover, the ""Bonus 3 DVD Movies"" are Project A, Project A 2, and Dragon Lord. I had overlooked this fact when I ordered the combo pack, thinking that all of the movies were Blu-ray.

The Blu-ray is a no frills disc, just the three films, no extras, and with English 2.0 stereo as the only audio option. The video quality on all three movies looks good to me.

The main reason I got this combo pack was for the SAS Gulf War survival story Bravo Two Zero. The movie does a good job of presenting Andy McNab's book (which has taken some knocks for alleged embellishment over the years). This is a movie that deserves a decent solo Blu-ray release with extra features, like interviews with the SAS veterans who were a part of the mission. One exception to the decent quality of the video is that the televised Gulf War stock-footage looks really bad and pixelated. Fortunately these sequences are fairly brief and not central to the movie.

Super Cop is presented in 2:35.1 widescreen, which is good news (compared to the previous 1.78 cropped blu), but it is the 91 minute US cut with only a dubbed English soundtrack. Still, I really like this movie, particularly Michelle Yeoh's impressive and engaging performance. This is another movie that deserves a decent solo Blu-ray release, with appropriate extras!

Finally there is Driven to Kill, a 2009 direct-to-video Steven Seagal flick that makes me wonder what happened to this guy after his series of crackling eighties action classics such as Above the Law, Out for Justice, and Under Siege. Still, this is better than a lot of his direct-to-video efforts (although I know that isn't saying much), and oddly enough it is the headliner on the package. The other two movies are the real value here.

Now for the DVD. It can pretty much be taken out of the box and tossed in the trash. Really!

If you found this DVD sitting loose someplace and put it into a player to watch it, you would think it was a bootleg copy that came from an Afghan bazaar! The menu is even ""less frills"" than the Blu-ray, having just the three names of the movies in plain text. There are compression artifacts evident in all three movies, with Dragon Lord being the only one of the three that is viewable on a large screen in my opinion (but still not great).

As noted, I missed the fact that these three movies were combined on one DVD when I ordered this. So while the poor quality was a surprise, it didn't really diminish from the overall value of the package, if you can find this set at the right price.

Just be warned -- if you are thinking about ordering this for any of the movies on the DVD, don't bother! You will almost certainly be disappointed by the poor video quality on that disc in this two-disc set.",1500681600,,3276,4.446666666666666
8529874,3,B008R52LCU,well i was thinking of buying this one but i saw a jackie chan 8 movie collection in DVD the 3 bottom movies are in the 8 pack collection.,1364774400,,138,3.793103448275862
8529875,4,B008R52LCU,"I won't review the movies here because if you're viewing this release, you already know what kind of movies you're looking at. If you enjoy action movies from the 80's or 90's, then you'll enjoy this release.

A note of clarification, it says on the case Blu-Ray + DVD combo pack, but it may not mean what you would normally expect. Usually a BD + DVD combo pack would include the same movie on both BD and also on DVD, that is not the case here.
There is one BD and one DVD, and each one contains three separate movies.
On the Bluray disc you have:
Driven To Kill (Steven Seagal), Supercop (Jackie Chan), and Bravo Two Zero (Sean Bean).

And on the DVD you have:
Project A, Project A2, and Dragon Lord (all Jackie Chan movies)

Overall this set is a great value for your money if you're looking to collect some of these type of movies",1352937600,,835,4.272151898734177
