8600761,5,B007YUYCGC,"I never bought the series... But I DID watch the whole thing online and I loved it! I fell in love with the characters and the story plot was awesome. It was addicting and I couldn't stop watching. This series also got me to know Wallace Huo much better. He played the perfect Li Ge Xiao, the main lead. All the actors and actresses did a superb job!

The series doesn't have that intense love story but there is romance in there as well (; there's mystery of course because of the cases Yi Zhi Mei solves. Can I throw in the thriller as well? Lol if you watch you'll know what I mean. But definitely give it a shot in watching it first, and then buying the series. I would buy it but I have no space to put it '",1437696000,,712,4.014084507042254
