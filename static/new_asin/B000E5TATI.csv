8180238,4,B000E5TATI,"According to sources like IMDB it appears this was never released on video or DVD, however that's not right. This is the only release of this ultra rare screwball comedy and it was on the long defunct VidAmerica Label.

Directed by Roger Donaldson, who went on to much bigger projects, this nutty little film is a gently amusing gangster parody - that deserves a wider audience. The nice performances and sharp direction make this a very decent little flick. Check it out!",1136851200,3,472,4.7560975609756095
