8284785,5,B001BTDDNU,"This DVD is about 4 hours. There's two programs on both sides of the disc, would rather have them on just one side of the disc or it to be a 2 disc set. The programs look pretty good even on a large widescreen TV. I bought this mainly for the Les Paul & Mary Ford performance of ""Tiger Rag"". All together the duo performs three tunes. Classic TV at it's very best. Recommended",1400284800,,376,4.094594594594595
