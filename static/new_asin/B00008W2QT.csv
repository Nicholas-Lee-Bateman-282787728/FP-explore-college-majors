She was a little on the heavy (Thick) side but as you know, some of us like em like that. :-) Along with that it had a good storyline and the drama was captivating. So fellahs, get this one to watch with your lady, she'll like the story and you get ""eye-candy"". A win-win.",1266364800,4,396,4.223684210526316
1865050,3,B00008W2QT,"This film was pretty good but it was too predictable.  It was your typical fatal attraction movie but it didn't have you guessing.  The main character, Jackson, had a small fling with a female coworker before he got married.  Little does he know that she has an agenda up her sleeve for the two of them.  First of all, in the beginning when Jackson's wife got murdered, I had a hunch that the (other) woman was the suspect.  Sometimes that's the case when another woman wants another woman's man and is obsessed.  They really had that Jackson guy acting clueless.  Especially towards the end when he said ""so you're the one who killed my wife"".  I was like duh.  All the signs were there.  Showing up at his house unannounced all the time, demanding to spend time with him and forcing him to marry her.  I was like something should have went off in his head that this woman was nuts.

This wasn't a bad movie, I just wished the plot was more complex  and kind of played tricks with your mind like most movies do.  It was just too simple and you always had a feeling of what was going to happen next.  I'm not saying that you should waste time seeing this movie because it did have suspense.  It's kind of worth seeing.",1154649600,2,1218,4.346666666666667

1865053,4,B00008W2QT,"Hidden Blessing was one of BET's best film. I was suprise to see Kim Field play the killer in the movie. It was more of a where is Waldo type movie, but overall it was worth watching.",1103155200,6,183,3.972972972972973

7987523,5,B00008W2QT,"As i say this again the best movies are the ones like these!! meaning low budget made for television movies!! Unlike all the over hype big time  over paid advertisement. This movie is like life you never know where love is going to find you!! Sexy detective played by the very sexy & talented Cynda Williams of the great movie from back then ""One False Move"" which also feature Bill Paxton of many great movies such as Twister! Terminator! Titanic!! & more. But back to this current feature!! she investigates the death of a sexy male suspect played by Marc Gomes!! which she quickly falls for in her crusade of justice!!! for the murder of his wife. & this movie also feature the wonderful beautiful talented Kim Fields of the ""Facts of life"" ""Living Single"" & so much more!! who adds a strange but obsessive twist to this feature!! I would recommend this to any casual movie lover just like me!!!! Thanks & enjoy from the BET Movie collection!!! (:(:",1444089600,,952,4.6

7987528,5,B00008W2QT,A very good murder mystery.  Detective shows/murder mysteries our my favorite as long as it is not blood and gore.  Movies that one would see on AMC are movies that I would likely order.  Hawaii -five -O for instance or Old Hitchcock movies....like Vertigo,1356220800,,256,4.7727272727272725
