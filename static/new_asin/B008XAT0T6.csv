I had seen ""Saving Silverman"" last year and found this combo pack when searching for it.  All four of these movies were worth watching.

8532014,5,B008XAT0T6,"Four very funny movies that I hadn't heard of, at least not all of them. If you like offbeat comedies (think FARGO or ELECTION or GO) then you're bound to enjoy these.",1417737600,,167,4.25

8532016,5,B008XAT0T6,"The main reason I bought this DVD was for the film Hexed. I first saw the movie on late night TV a few years ago, and I really liked it. This spoof is edgy and a bit on the dark side. Having the other 3 films in the package is a great bonus, too. I think these ""Hollywood Hits"" 4 movie collection sets from Mill Creek are great. These are all licensed titles (not their typical public domain films) with very good video and audio quality, and are inexpensive to own.",1394841600,,466,4.131868131868132
8532017,5,B008XAT0T6,"Not much needs said, Saving Silverman is the funniest movie! The other two are dumb but it was cheap so bought the tri pack.",1366934400,,124,4.208333333333333
8532018,1,B008XAT0T6,The packaging for this DVD collection lists SAVING SILVERMAN as being presented in WIDESCREEN Format. It isn't. It's FULL SCREEN (PAN & SCAN.) The three other movies are all presented in WIDESCREEN.,1366416000,2,198,5.21875
