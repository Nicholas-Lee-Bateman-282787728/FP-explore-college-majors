8656921,5,B007LSF3RO,"Seasoned anime watchers know that slice-of-life dramedies, on the whole, are often bittersweet.  AnoHana is no exception to this rule, and uses the framework of a high school anime to grapple with the difficult subjects of grief, on the one hand, and growing apart, on the other.

I feel that it handles both of these topics masterfully, presenting a very human (and therefore believable) cast, rife with guilt and flaws, for our viewing pleasure.  My favorite characters were probably Yukiatsu and Anarou, as I felt the animators took greater pains to make them original characters, as opposed to basing them around stereotypical molds.  Menma, disappointingly, falls into the ""very sweet, always thinking of others, all the guys like me"" mold, while Jintan is your typical slice-of-life hero.  In the end, however, the cliches really didn't bother me much--the show is simply that good.

Potential viewers will also be pleased to know that AnoHana does not ""dodge the bullet"" concerning romance--meaning that the overarching question of who the main character ""likes"" is not pushed aside in order to give a watered down ending that will appeal to no one, as opposed to answering the question directly and risk offending certain viewers.

For those who watched Angel Beats!, and enjoyed it immensely, here is another show about the pain of loss and the necessity of moving on.  I am continually amazed by a show's ability to address real-life topics by way of the supernatural, and AnoHana is one of these small masterpieces.  Please watch soon, and enjoy much.",1333670400,7,1562,5.0703125
