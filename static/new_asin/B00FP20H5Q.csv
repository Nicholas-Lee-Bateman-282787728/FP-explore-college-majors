8617508,5,B00FP20H5Q,"Qubec's youthful and highly artistic cinematic genius, Xavier Dolan, in his early to mid-twenties, has become an internationally recognised celebrity of the film world. He has done so equally brilliantly (very appealingly) as actor as well as film-maker (scriptwriter, director, etc.).

Dolan's first two films, romantic comedies (which his gay sensibility imbues) with such deft portrayals of human quirks and foibles as well as real heartache, have become successful with public and critics alike and are available in various North American and European DVD editions. Initially they were released on DVD without English subtitles, which posed a limitation on how British, American, and English-Canadian consumers, among other non-Francophone cinema lovers, could enjoy and would accept the initial video releases of the films. By now (writing in Aug. 2014), there are choices of editions with the English subtitles, for those who wish to have them.

Then there is his third movie, ""Laurence Anyways"", an audacious film even if one that does not convince or please so well as its two predecessors. It even drags on for too long, something about which one cannot accuse any of Dolan's films (which utterly lack such ""longueurs""), before or since, of doing.

There are numerous excellent reviews on Amazon's various national WWW sites of the three movies (and I, too, have reviewed separately, among them, ""J'ai tu ma mere"" for Amazon), so there is need in this review only to describe the present U.K.-released compilation of Dolan's first three motion pictures, with their dialogue still in French only and now with the English subtitles, as part of this compilation, comprising ""I Killed My Mother"" (""J'ai tu ma mere""), ""Heartbeat"" (""Les Amours imaginaires"") and ""Laurence Anyways"", with some brief but welcome bonus features for two of the three movies, all of that together titled collectively ""La Folie d'amour: the Xavier Dolan Collection"" (Network Releasing 7953852, on three DVDs). This set has not come available yet (as of mid-2014) in a domestic North American edition coded to the North American NTSC video standard, but it is available here and there in Canada and the U.S. as an import coded for PAL, the European standard. It has been worth the wait, to say the least of it, to have the movies, in various choice options for the three of them, alone or together, with the English subtitles included!

This video product, ""La Folie d'amour"", promotes these motion pictures under the unlikely conception, stated on the verso of the last flap of its container, that Dolan's  three films therein constitute a sort of ""triptych [which] begins with a cathartic ... account of an adolescent's love-hate relationship with his mother (`I Killed My Mother' [of] 2009), before moving on to a study of friendship turning to rivalry over an attractive newcomer (`Heartbeats' [of] 2010), and finishing with a couple's traumatic  fight for survival and acceptance as one partner makes the transition from man to [artificially simulated] woman (`Laurence Anyways' [of] 2012)"" (quoted from verso of end side of the folding container). The description of what the films are about individually is helpful, but so to link them as a trilogy is less convincing.

Imposing such an interpretation upon Xavier Dolan's first three films (i.e. of continuity from and between each one to the next sufficient for them to constitute together a trilogy) seems a bit far-fetched! It is true that Dolan has admitted that the ""J'ai tu ma mere"" and ""Les Amours imaginaires"" both reflect some of life as he has experienced it, but what about ""Laurence Anyways""? So far, I have heard no news that Dolan has any intension to become a ""tranny"" or, even less likely, that he desires to proceed further, to submit his male genitalia to the surgeon's blade, in order to undergo a sex change operation. It is obvious, too, that in choosing another actor, Melvil Poupaud, to play the male title role lead in ""Laurence Anyways"" (whereas Dolan himself played the role corresponding, however loosely, to himself, under whichever other name, in the two preceding movies), Dolan apparently would not have been equating himself with the character Laurence, however much Dolan may have been sympathising with Laurence's plight. In fact, ""Laurence Anyways"" is the only film of these three in which Dolan is not part of the cast of actors in one of his own movies.

Just enjoy each of these films for what they are. Savour, too, the brief, but quite helpful and enjoyable, extra features included on the second and third films, which, so far as I can ascertain, are absent from separately available editions so far of those two movies on DVD. If one has equipment to play the three discs in this product's European PAL standard's coding, benefit, then, from the three movies being so conveniently packaged, to have them together, without necessarily linking in one's mind the films' supposd common ""raison d'tre"" so closely as the printed comments on the container suggest to do so.

Concerning that container on which those comments appear, it has three flaps, one per disc, folding over and into each other. This makes for an attractive way to package the three DVD discs within the container but it leaves the contents exposed directly to the chance of falling out of it, especially when the top or bottom of the container is handled in vertical position if the discs perchance are not clinging securely to their prongs. That really was not a good idea. A slipcase in which to insert the folding container would have been an helpful additional asset to minimise such an accident's occurrence. A slipcase also would help to keep dust or grit from accumulating on the discs while shelved or otherwise stored. However, that is a minor matter. This 3-DVDs set is an excellent way to acquire Xavier Dolan's best-known films so far to appear.",1409184000,,5901,5.050308008213553
