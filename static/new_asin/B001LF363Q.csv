HOTEL TORGO (2004) is a 27-minute Canadian documentary about the making of MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE back in 1966, a movie so bad it fell into obscurity until it was rescued by Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1993.  Basically the director follows behind-the-camera AD and jack-of-all-trades Bernie Rosemblum (who also appeared on-camera as half of a smooching couple in the '66 original) as he reminisces and wanders around the movie set, still intact over the years though defiled by graffiti and random vandalism.  This doc offers some behind-the-scenes interest about MANOS: for example, it appears that the film's director Hal Warren pulled a ""Producers"" and sold 300 percent of it to raise money.  However, a couple of facts were inaccurate, fortunately:  neither Tom Neyman nor his daughter, Jackie Neyman Jones, were dead.  In fact, Jackie Neyman Jones, a child at the time of filming, went on to write a book about the ill-fated movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-with-Manos-The-Hands-of-Fate-How-I-was-the-Child-Star-of-the-Worst-Movie-Ever-Made-and-Lived-to-Tell-the-Story/dp/1593939221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up with Manos: The Hands of Fate: How I was the Child Star of the Worst Movie Ever Made and Lived to Tell the Story</a>

The story of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Guffman/dp/B00005LC5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for Guffman</a>-esque community theater actor and his troupe who make a movie in the desert is fascinating and definitely worthy of recognition.  When the film goes back to the old locations and finds them still standing and recognizable it gave me chills.  As someone who's worked on a lot of independent films it's remarkable for its honesty, and for a moment you really feel like you're there with Hal Warren, in the desert of El Paso at night, shooting his gawdawful nonsense.

The film could have stood to be longer and could have used more thorough research.  It claims the little girl is dead but several sources claim she is alive, and in written accounts she's had interesting things to say, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000/dp/B00005S8L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>&nbsp;angle of the story isn't really incorporated completely.  The film lacks critical focus: It'd be interesting to try to place ""Manos"" in the context of 1960s independent film in general, and exploitation films, or Texas cinema in particular.",1300924800,,1467,6.097087378640777
