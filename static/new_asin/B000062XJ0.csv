1685233,2,B000062XJ0,"Mediocre low budget film. It's as if someone saw King of the Hill and decided to make a movie about Luann's life and cast Luann herself. I am all for low budget, semi coming of age, sob story. But this was poorly written, directed, and acted. It feels more like a senior video production class project. And a group of theater geeks got together to create this . And then all of a sudden it turns into a really long and bad music video, with poor choice of music as the lead star has a mental meltdown. I suppose since it is low budget that's the only thing they could afford. Anyway, I find it hard to believe that when a high school kids mom dies that she will be left alone. IF she is still a minor child protective services will intervene. Or at least school counselors or someone. It had potential, but it just fell flat. There was no real character development. So the mom is a drunk... and the daughter, as is in every case, becomes the adult. In passing we learn the daughter was pregnant and now is not... but that is it. I only watched this movie on Amazon because it was free. Brittany Murphy is a much better actress when she is put in a comedic role,her talents shine there.",1367193600,,1186,4.252212389380531
1685234,5,B000062XJ0,A little sad but very real! So many families have had this experience on way or another. I loved Brittany Murphy in this film God. Bless her heart. May she continue to rest in peace.,1360454400,2,182,4.228571428571429
1685235,2,B000062XJ0,"was i the only one who thought falling sky was a sad but good movie? I liked that Brittany murphy was in it but also cuz it was one the movies of hers i hadn't seen yet. Her acting was great as a young woman dealing with mature subjects in her own life like alcoholism and young love. It was a different character than in ""Clueless"",the happy go lucky high schooler tring to fit in,but,in a way,she was still trying to fit in into life,in ""falling sky.""Also,I liked that Jeremy Jordan,former pop singer in the 90's,was in it,too as a guy she meets and likes. In life,Brit was gone too soon. She had much more to do still. The movie had to do with young people and love and family crises like an alcoholic mother and later a tragedy that made the daughter question her place in life,while dealing with death and abandonement. Good movie,but sad that Brit's gone:)R.I.P WAtch it and byu it from amazon for a great deal. Try it. You might like it.

1685237,3,B000062XJ0,"A decent movie about a cycle of poverty and addiction...Brittany Murphy and Jeremy Jordan (yes, Jeremy ""The Right Kind of Love"" Jordan!) stand out with their performances in an otherwise Lifetime-movie-of-the-week caliber film.  Worth a watch, for sure, and at a low price might be worth purchasing if you're a big Murphy or JJ fan...",1060732800,5,334,5.072727272727272
