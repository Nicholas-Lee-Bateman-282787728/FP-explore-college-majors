8398886,5,B003KQ1I7A,"Kaamelott is a french humoristic series about King Arthur, that uses linguistic anachronisms, colorful slang, hilarious word plays and that throws here and there very smart thoughts about subjects such as death penalty, torture, war, mysogyny. Arthur is indeed a modern man in advance for his time (in the series supposedly in the 6th century)and he often disagrees with his pairs about those themes. The series also possesses excellent actors, and high quality fast paced dialogues. This 3rd season is as funny as the previous ones, but the new thing is that the plot really evolves, following the arthurian legend, and the season ends on a cliffhanger for several characters.

As usual, the season is made of 100 episodes of over 3 minutes each (on 2 discs). You also have in the boxset a disc of extras with a very interesting documentary (about 50 minutes long) about the legend of Arthur. A lot of scholars are interviewed as well as the actors of the show. Here the documentary is about ""War at the time of Arthur"". You find a similar documentary on the extra disc of season 2, but about ""Athur and women around him"".

You can read more about Kaamelott in my reviews of the Season 1 and 2. This is one of my favorite series, and I would highly recommend it.",1309392000,,1263,4.6591928251121075
