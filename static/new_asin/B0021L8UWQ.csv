3839531,2,B0021L8UWQ,"I had moderate expectations for this by-the-numbers heist flick.  I really like the cast, and was begging for some predictable but action packed entertainment.  Is that too much to ask?

Apparently so.  This starts off fairly strong, as the group plan their act.  Of course nothing goes smoothly in the life of crime.

When people are placed in stressful situations, they inevitably are going to panic and make foolish decisions.  I totally understand that.  But this has some of the most ludicrous, incomprehensible moments that defy any sense of logic.  Moments that would not even be attempted in a freakin dream!  It completely undermines the entire story.  Your brain does not turn that far off.  As long as people accept this kind of silly junk from Hollywood they are gonna keep dishing it out.  Please stop!

3839532,3,B0021L8UWQ,"I pretty much knew what to expect when I dropped this in the old DVD player and I was exactly right. Pop a beer. Grab some pizza and have at it. No great shakes here. It's a heist gone bad flick with a good cast and ""by the book"" directing.

Security guards for an armored car company figure to cash in on one of their runs by faking a robbery and grabbin' the cash. Of course one little thing goes wrong and the whole plan unravels like a cheap suit.

Good stuff....Good cast. Shot, directed, edited and scored well enough.

Bad stuff.....Just not different enough. As others have mentioned, you know pretty early on where this is going and the route becomes all too familiar. One of the only facets of this that held my interest was how the guards were going to get their turn-coat buddy out of the armored truck he'd locked himself into.

It runs at a trim 87 minutes so if you want a quick action fix and don't want to use too much of your brain, this is not a bad way to spend your time.",1269043200,,992,4.178010471204188
3839533,4,B0021L8UWQ,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. It has a lot of action, and tense moments. Ty Hackett is an new employee at the Eagle Shield armored car company, and he is about to lose his house. His buddies that work with him come up with a plan to rob 42 million dollars, but Ty backs out as soon as someone is killed. He soon barricades himself inside one of the trucks and tries to wait until the police come looking for them. Will Ty survive? I highly recommend ARMORED!!!",1268870400,,475,4.173913043478261

3839535,4,B0021L8UWQ,"Heist films have been a genre that has yielded some truly amazing movies. The recent THE ITALIAN JOB, RONIN and more, even the Pink Panther series, have given us moments where we root for the bad guy in his attempt to pilfer the goods from an even worse bad guy or banker. And now we have a new entry, ARMORED.

I must admit that when I saw the preview for this film (over and over again it seemed) I had no interest in it. Even as I put it in the DVD player I wasn't expecting much. Perhaps this is why I was so pleasantly surprised.

The film focuses on a group of armored car drivers, friends in the field. New to the group is Ty Hackett (Columbus Short). Ty was a decorated war hero in Iraq who returned to a home where his parents had both died and he was not responsible for his younger brother Jimmy.

Working with Ty is Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon), Ty's godfather and mentor at the company. Through Mike, Ty got the job he now has as well as friends like Baines (Laurence Fishburne), Quinn (Jean Reno), Palmer (Amaury Nolasco) and Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich). This group welcomes Ty with open arms and a sense of brotherhood.

On a regular run, the armored vehicle containing Ty and Mike and driven by Baines shorts out. Mike smells sugar in the gas tank burning and they know it's a set up. A black van pulls up, two men place explosives on the window and as it is about to go off a few firecrackers explode leaving Baines and Mike laughing. It was nothing more than an initiation prank on Ty who has passed his probationary period.

Mike gives Ty rides to and from work and one night not long after the prank, he tells Ty they have a solution to his money problems (he's about to lose his home). They plan to make the robbery real. The men guarding the money plan on a heist that would take in $42 million and expect him to be a part of the operation. Ty at first refuses but after returning home to find a social worker ready to take Jimmy form him, he agrees, as long as no one gets hurt.

The plan moves along like clockwork, the team loading the money and then heading to an abandoned steel factory where they plan on hiding the money and then making it look as if they were hijacked and the money stolen. But as with all good plans, things go wrong when a bum hiding in the plant sees them. As he tries to get away, Baines shoots him in the back.

Ty has had enough. He attempts to help the man but Mike shoots the bum in the back making sure he's dead. Ty no longer recognizes these men as who he thought they were and takes one of the two armored vehicles they came in to get away. He's stopped by Mike in the other but then locks himself in with the load of cash in the vehicle. Now the men change from simple thieves to murderers who want nothing less than to get Ty and the money out.

While they do so, a police car with an officer (Milo Ventimiglia) shows up. When Ty uses a battery to make the siren on his vehicle go off, Baines shoots the policeman as well. Now the group faces not just murder charges but the possible death of a policeman as well. But he's not dead and Ty risks a move to rescue him and get him inside the vehicle with him.

The cat and mouse game of how to get Ty out, how Ty gets help and whether or not these men will get away with murder and the cash makes for a high speed thriller that delivers on all levels. The most amazing thing to me was that as I watched I found myself surprised that it moved along so quickly. I lost track of time and never once felt like the film dragged at any point.

The film is a perfect combination of story, special effects and performances that make you truly believe these men are who they claim to be. Their motivations, their passions and their brutality are demonstrated by each individual as the film draws to its dramatic ending.

Is it predictable? Sure. But it is the rare heist film that isn't. And even those tend to have a last minute twist in common that makes them different. The joy of a heist film is less about its predictablity and more about the ride it offers getting there.

If you're looking for a film that offers adrenaline pushing moments and a hero to boot, then make a point of picking this one up. It's not a rental only film but one that movie fans might want to even add to their collection.",1268524800,5,4295,4.180169286577993
3839536,4,B0021L8UWQ,"""Armored"" is another film in the heist thriller genre. Here, we find a group of men working for an armored truck company that decide to stash $42 Million worth of money they picked up during a routine job, with the plan of making it look like they were robbed, then run with the money. But as things go with plans like this, they usually go awry. While the plot is predictable, there is no denying that it's a fun, if conventional, addition to the genre. The cast and crew make up for a lot with some terrific performances, along with some great tension-filled moments and exciting chase sequences. Fans of the genre will find little to disappoint with ""Armored.""

*spoiler alert of sorts* ....

When the line comes up from Duncan Ashcroft (Fred Ward): ""there's talk of a reward"", given the sub-plot about Jimmy and Ty, it would have been nice for a little epilogue, even a small sentence to let us know that they were going to be fine.. ""There's talk of a reward."" could mean anything.. and a small smirk from Ty isn't a resolve - again, he doesn't know what that entails at that moment..

*spoiler done*

Other than that, I really enjoyed the film.. Good popcorn flick.. so long as you don't overthink it too much. Eckhart (Milo Ventimiglia) the cop is hot eye-candy, and Matt Dillon (Mike)never seems to age and gets better year by year.. but what the hell has happened to Skeet Ulrich?

Maybe it was the presentation to me at the time but then again, I thought that I would just wait it out and just rent it when it comes out. That was 5 years ago. I was at the local discount store and I saw this little gem in the $8 bin. So I snagged it and watched the DVD last night. Do I regret not seeing this movie in the theaters? No. Do I regret not buying this movie when it came out on DVD? Yes. The story to me is solid and it kept me guessing which way it was going to end up. Not to mention that the movie is different and this is a different take on a heist movie. As per the extras in the DVD, there were no real bad guys in the flick. Just greedy men that got too greedy for their own good in the end. Columbus Short's character was surprisingly good in this movie and didn't bore me with the usual ""Hero of The Day"" antics. This movie also kept it simple and got to the point. The supporting cast really should have gotten more props for this movie as their characters were just as robust.

The cast is full of talented people but their skills are underused. Only three of them are given enough time to play their roles properly.

This picture contains a moral message.

There are some chokingly suspenseful moments. They are the reasons that kept me watching this movie till the ends. However, it has some Unforgivable Logical Holes. They substantially reduce the quality of the film. For example, a bomb can be made within minutes. Another one is the scene with the floor of the armored car. It is a bad joke. There are some more but I cannot tell you all about them. Otherwise, it will ruin your enjoyment.

It made no sense. The ""good"" guy has a change of heart mid-heist
because he wants no blood on his hands, only every action he takes
causes more blood to be shed. It wasn't realistic. I think given the
situation, he would have had to continue with the status quo once in as
deep as he was. Why cause all the chaos? I never want to see the good
guy get killed, but as I watched this movie, I did. I enjoy a good
heist movie, and this one had an all star cast, but all I can wonder is
how this ever got funding. It disappoints on every level. The plot has
to be well developed, and this one wasn't. Given the main character's
financial dilemma, I also think it didn't make sense for him to turn
against his partners. It's the kind of movie where a guy like him would
go through with it, and perhaps have his conscience nag at him later.
Then, some suspense could have been developed in that regard in terms
of the other members of the team going to lengths to keep his mouth
shut. I really wanted to like this. Instead, I ended up yelling at my

3839739,2,B0021L8UWQ,"Yeah, ARMORED is not a good movie.  I had a pretty low expectation, and even that was not met.  I was looking for mindless action done with some style...and didn't even get that.  For example, THE TRANSPORTER is, by most measures, a pretty bad movie.  Yet it has a flash, a moxie and level of skill when depicting action that it's actually pretty enjoyable.  Turn off mind and just absorb some eye-candy.  ARMORED makes you turn off your mind, and then nearly fall asleep.

It's about a group of employees for an armored truck company who decide that they are going to fake a heist so that they can steal the $42 million they will be traveling with.  So we're introduced to a very bland group of these guys, including Matt Dillon, Jean Reno & Laurence Fishburne.  The obligatory ""new guy"" is played by Columbus Short.  He's a decent fella who's run into some serious money trouble after returning from duty in Iraq.  So he reluctantly agrees to go along with the plot...because ""no one will get hurt"" after all.

Nearly half the darn movie is taken up with introducing us to this gang and then making us wonder if the new guy will join the heist...as if there was any doubt.  There is no character development, just locker room scenes and bar scenes.  The script is bland and we get literally no real sense of these men as people.  They are devices.

Finally, the heist begins, and if you think ""no one will get hurt"" then you aren't much a movie-goer.  Things go wrong and then they go worse.  Watching these guys make one stupid decision after another is amusing, I guess...but to say it strains credulity is putting it mildly.  And yet a movie with no brain CAN be fun...if it has pace and momentum.  ARMORED has neither.  The men basically spend the final half of the film in one small section of an abandoned warehouse/factory complex...yelling at each other and essentially proving yet again that there is no honor among thieves.

It's deeply dull, and everyone is wasted in their roles.  Some major screen performers such as Jean Reno and Fred Ward almost literally make no impression.  Each time you see them, you practically think, ""oh hey, I forgot he was in this film.""

It's tempting to give just one star...but I usually save those for films that actively anger me with their awfulness.  This one just disappointed and bored me...thus, a huge 1.5 stars.  AVOID!",1330819200,,2374,4.60381861575179

Matt Dillon (The Outsiders and You, Me, and Dupree) and Columbus Short (Accepted and Stomp the Yard) are the two main characters that are part of a security team with Laurence Fishburne (Matrix) that transports money for banks. The story starts with Short's character, Ty, getting promoted from probation to a real guard. Even though Ty is successful at work his personal life is a mess. He is high school brother's guardian because their parents had died recently and also their house in close to being taken by the bank. I enjoyed the setup and even though you can tell where the movie is going in the beginning it still makes Ty's character easy to connect with and understand his struggles. This movie reminded me of Phonebooth. It has one event that is the majority of the movie without really changing location or adding characters. I would recommend this movie for older children. There is violence and some language but no sexual innuendo that I can remember. The movie doesn't even have any women as main characters.

Ty is the oldest and he takes care of his brother, providing for their needs as best he can by working as an Eagle Shield security guard. He's getting notifications from the bank about overdue mortgage payments, so he tries to get extra shifts but there isn't enough work to go around. Soon after a coworker, Mike, tells Ty about a plan to take 42 million dollars. Ty isn't willing to go along, but then circumstances at home become even worse when a social worker makes an unexpected visit and he decides to take part in the heist.

Ty (Columbus Short) was a decorated veteran who served in Iraq. He was feeling bad about the kills in Baghdad.  It wasn't in his heart to go along with the plan. He didn't want anyone to get hurt and he certainly didn't want anyone to die. Stealing the money was supposed to be simple, but things got complicated and suddenly his life was in danger. His military training helped him survive... Ty was a strong man with a good heart, a quick-thinker and I'm sure he would have died for his brother (Andre Kinney) if it had come down to that. I found him admirable.

Mike (Matt Dillon) knew Ty's father for years and he was Ty's Godfather. He claimed to care about Ty and his brother, Jimmy, but that changed quickly when millions of dollars were at stake. He had the audacity to be offended because Ty no longer trusted him.... ""Get out of the truck."" - Yeah, right. Nobody in their right mind would have gotten out of that truck.

Baines (Laurence Fishburne) was a crazy man with an itchy trigger finger; a very unlikeable character.

Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich) was a family man. He had second thoughts after a while and tried to do good when things went wrong. I felt so bad him.

Palmer (Amaury Nolasco) claimed to know God and he read his Bible often. I wasn't clear why he went along with the plan. He should have been the one to at least try to talk everyone else out of it.

Quinn (Jean Reno) was a character I couldn't really figure out. He had no problem putting another innocent life in danger to get Ty out of that truck, so I'm thinkin' greed was his motive for stealing the money.

Forty-two million dollars - seven million each, tempting, indeed, but if these men wouldn't have given in to the temptation or, more importantly, if they wouldn't have turned on each other, lives wouldn't have been lost so senselessly. The `love of money' has never been a good thing and never will be.

There are, of course, guns and bloody scenes (nothing I couldn't handle watching) in this movie and explosions (there was an image that disturbed me a bit) but not much profanity. I can't really describe Armored as an entertaining film; thought-provoking is what comes to mind. I do believe it's a movie worth watching.",1284940800,,2814,4.469785575048733
3839770,3,B0021L8UWQ,"Featuring a talented high profile cast that includes Matt Dillon (Wild Things), Laurence Fishburne (Event Horizon), Skeet Ulrich (Jericho), and Jean Reno (The Professional), Armored (2009) is a film that seeks to be taken as a serious action drama, however a weak script, makes that goal problematic.  Believability is a major issue, in director Nimrod Antal's (Predators, Vacancy) flawed caper film.

A group of five security guards working for the Eagle Shield Armored Transport, intend to commit a robbery, on a run to a Federal Reserve Bank where two armored cars will pick up 42 million in cash.  The plan is to detour the cars, unload the cash, and then stage a fake robbery.  It's a very simplistic scheme, that sounds dubious to begin with, but add in the fact that the plan requires the cooperation of a sixth guard, who is only informed of the proposed heist the day before the robbery is scheduled to happen, and you have a scenario that has very little credibility.

Like forcing a square peg in a round hole, events in the movie proceed, but things just don't fit right.  Mike Cochrane (Matt Dillon) is the mastermind behind the robbery plan.  The last one to be brought in on the scheme is Ty Hackett (Columbus Short), a military veteran who also happens to be Cochrane's godchild.

Whether Hackett is in or out, is the critical question that affects the fate of the five other guards.  Under financial pressure, Hackett reports for work the following day, and the plan is set in action.  The money is picked up, and the armored cars are diverted to an abandoned factory, where the cash is unloaded and hidden.  Things appears to be going well, when a homeless man is discovered hiding in area, and is chased down and killed.  Believing that things have gone too far, Hackett locks himself inside one of the cars.  At first, the gang try to convince him to open the doors, but things get desperate and violent, as it won't be long before the crime is discovered, and the police begin to search for the armored cars.

The plan never proceeds past the robbery stage, but judging by what happens, it is doubtful that the guards would have had the brains or resolve to stand up to a serious police investigation.  These are hardly hardened men well prepared for adversity.  One man gives up, and another commits suicide, while others are unstable and trigger happy.  There are some major issues with first time screenwriter James V. Simpson's screenplay, and there is very little that stands up to any serious scrutiny.

Armored is a film where matters spiral out of control into complete chaos for the guards, and to some extent the filmmakers themselves.  Despite some well-executed action sequences, this is a poorly conceived effort, that unfortunately fails to fully utilize the talents of a top notch cast, who try their best with what they are given.  The tone is deadly serious, but the story just doesn't measure up.",1284681600,,2935,4.762845849802371

3839772,4,B0021L8UWQ,"ARMORED is a tight little film about friendship in the workplace, betrayal, and convictions - and oh yes, it is a heist caper story.  For openers this viewer was perturbed that the cast listed on the cover of the DVD and certainly in the credits of the film focuses on 'names' of actors we all know, supposedly to anchor an audience.  But the main character of this film is played by Columbus Short, and because he is not as famous, his name appears at the end of the list, very much in the shadow of the big guys names who have far less to do with the story.  But that is Hollywood marketing issue...

Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) has returned to the US from a heroic tour in Iraq, his parents have been killed in an auto accident leaving Ty in charge if his younger artistic but somewhat schoolphobic brother Jimmy (Andre Kinney): Ty has joined a squad of armored guards who transfer money from banks to banks, and yet is not making enough money to support his home life.  He needs a raise or more shifts.  He is well-liked and respected by his team of fellow guards - Boss Ashcroft (Fred Ward), head guard Mike Cochrane (Matt Dillon) who is Ty's godfather, Quinn (Jean Reno), Baines (Laurence Fishburne), Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich), and Palmer (Amaury Nolasco).  There is a particularly heavy load of money to pick up and Mike, knowing that Ty needs additional funds, unveils a plan to mimic a well-known but unsolved heist: the plan is to pick up the money ($42 million), hide it, destroy the truck, and keep the money divided among the guards.  Ty balks at the plan, but when the Welfare Department threatens to place Jimmy in a foster home, Ty reluctantly aligns with the plan - being promised that no one will get hurt.  Mike repeats 'There are no bad guys here' and the heist begins.  Needless to say the heist goes wrong - the act in observed by a homeless person and is killed by the Baines.  A passing police officer (Milo Ventimiglia)  hears the shots and stops to inspect, and is also shot by Baines. Ty freaks and seeing that he knows too much, is locked in his van with the police officer whom he nurses and reassures he will get them both out alive.  Jimmy is brought in as a hostage and that is Ty's breaking point. Some twists and turns occur, more of the group die, and the finale leaves Ty in a position better than expected.

Director Nimr&oacute;d Antal ('Control', 'Vacancy', 'Predator', etc) understands the importance of pacing a film and the story moves like a rapid transit train out of control, heightening the drama.  The finest work in the film is by star Columbus Short, but all of the costars turn in credible roles.  It is not a great movie by any means, but it is worth watching as an action drama of friendships betrayed.  Grady Harp, September 10",1283644800,2,2775,4.49601593625498

Something of a pleasant surprise, ""Armored"" is an action movie heist yarn that is a bit lighter on the action and a bit heavier on the characterization than the majority of films in that particular genre.

Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) is the newest member of a team of armored-vehicle guards - a team that includes such familiar faces as Matt Dillon, Laurence Fishburne and Jean Reno - who plan to stage a robbery of several of their trucks, then keep the cash (42 million big ones) for themselves.  A veteran of the Iraq war, Ty is a young man who's struggling to pay two mortgages while raising his troubled young brother following the death of their parents.  Highly principled by nature, Ty is at first reluctant to join his compatriots in their illegal scheme, but his dire financial circumstances ultimately make the lure of easy money damn-near-impossible to resist.  But when the job, rather predictably, doesn't go off quite as planned, the men, Ty included, are suddenly confronted with having to cross over that fine ethical line that separates the petty (or not-so-petty) crook from the cold-blooded killer.

Though the post-robbery scenes do feel a bit more trite and conventional than the pre-robbery ones, the movie, as a whole, is a sincere and well-played drama that does the best it can with its obviously limited resources and budget.  This includes providing some sharp and well-written dialogue (by first-time screenwriter James V. Simpson) for characters who refuse to become walking stereotypes in a storyline that nicely sidesteps any number of potential heist-movie cliches.  Similarly, director Nimrod Antal makes his minimalist action scenes count by reminding us that such sequences can still be exciting when we actually care about what happens to the people involved in them - and when they have a powerful dramatic dynamic operating at their core.

The performances are all first-rate, but special recognition must go to Short and Dillon who both use restraint and understatement to make their respective characters believable and genuine.",1282608000,,2077,5.13946587537092

That's what a few armored car drivers get in their heads - and that's the temptation that starts to leak into the newest teammate's head. He wants to be a good brother and a good father figure and he wants to provide a steady home and allow him to go to art school. But the pay he has - he can barely make it. so when he hears a plan that some people have been hatching a long time - it seems like payday and especially so when his conscious hears the words ""nobody will get hurt,"" ""its insured money,"" and ""nobody will suspect a thing."" But things never go that way, do they?

As far as heist movies go, this movie had a good set-up. It wasn't just about the job - it was about the people and how they live everyday. We don't see a lot of the other members, but the person we do see - his life is hard. i like the way that was portrayed because, when serving your country and then coming back and finding that you mean less that average, you might find yourself angry. Really angry.

The movie has some big names in it, too, and they do a great job. I always like Larry in movies, and he always seems to like me back. He plays a hot-head here, shotgun in hand, and you can feel that being a problem. He and M. Dillon even go as far as to test their fellow member, seeing how he would react to a fake robbery. And then the ""what ifs"" come, planting a need in his head for more than help but for that freedom.

The movie does have some problems, mind you. The place they choose to hide the money - bad. The head of everything - I kept thinking ""in on it."" The idea of the stick-up and the way everything would play out - bad idea. and the people they were planning off of - they failed. Still, nobody said these guys were smart and alot of this is simply a lot of people getting together and oversetting their bounds.
That seems to happen a lot - and 42 million reasons could cause a lot of things to occur.

I liked the movie - it had a lot to offer - and it was interesting. The way things happen, the spiral that tightens and the little mistakes that grow; you might find that really interesting. There is also some personal development here and some missing - but there is a lot of time showing you the world around a person expected to keep all that money safe. That, in and of itself, almost seemed criminal at times. Still, decisions are made and the movie pays out interestingly. I gave it 4 for that (I would have gone closer to 3.5 had I the choice)because I liked the movie a lot but I would have liked to see a few things happen in the movie. I still say it is worth a watch and it is worth liking somewhat - even if it is only somewhat. Rent it, see what you think, and then come back.",1270771200,,2815,4.021428571428571

3839863,3,B0021L8UWQ,"Hmm, I'm not sure my review title is correct as I do remember the film, having just watched it last night, but at the same time it really seems that there's nothing all that memorable about Armored that sets it apart as a film.  It could be an interesting look at the morality of a bank heist, but that ground has been well covered in the past.  It could be a look at how society has let down our service people, but that too has been covered by other films in the past.  A look at employees that are working too hard while not getting paid enough, hasn't that been covered many times as well?

There's nothing really wrong with Armored, but at the same time, the story just doesn't seem all that moving.  The acting is fine though not terribly spectacular.  The script is very predictable, made even more so if you have any memory of the trailers that had run back when the film made it's brief appearance in theatres (it seems the marketing department for the studio behind this film was determined to give away many of the plot points of the film in their trailer).  The suspense level is ok but not not much more than that, and the action level is ok at best with much of the film apparently trying to be more cerebral (trying, but not necessarily doing a great job at it).

Armored makes for an ok rental, but for most viewers one viewing is likely going to be enough.  Tread carefully unless you are a big fan of the stars here.",1269734400,2,1434,4.281481481481482

3839865,3,B0021L8UWQ,"""Armored"" is a heist movie. It is a slick, if not stunning, B action film starring a mostly male cast including Matt Dillon, Jean Reno, Lawrence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Milo Ventimiglia, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward and Columbus Short. The film is directed by Nimrd Antal known for ""Kontroll"" and ""Vacancy.""

In ""Armored"" five guards of transport security firm ""Eagle Shield"" concoct a plan of getting rich fast. They steal the $42 million they are carrying in the company's armored trucks, and pretend they are attacked by non-existent robbers. They are not going to risk their lives or anyone else's. But of course, they are mistaken.

Ty Hackett (Columbus Short), a new security guard of Eagle Shield, is approached by his co-worker Mike (Matt Dillon), who asks Ty to join the heist plan. Ty declines at first, but next morning he joins at the last minute. He needs money. He is not going to lose his house and brother. ""No one will get hurt."" That is what Mike promised him. But of course, someone gets seriously hurt.

""Armored"" is an old-fashioned heist film with a few nice twists, but it lacks an interesting plotline. The ""heist"" plan of the six guards is too simple to be taken seriously. The company should be aware of the possibility of such ""heist,"" but it just doesn't seem so. The film needs more details as to how money is transferred, or guards are supervised.

While it may not be a groundbreaking film (and Jean Reno's role is disappointingly small), ""Armored"" is a solid and entertaining 88-minute ride.",1269648000,,1521,4.793893129770993
3839866,1,B0021L8UWQ,"Upon viewing the trailers, I waited in anticipation to see this movie. I have just seen it and the first thing I did was google the writer to see if maybe he is a wealthy personality, who once had his money stolen during an armored car transfer and maybe this script was now his closure and revenge? This movie ought to be entitled ""How stupid can you be with 42 million dollars""? The subtitle should read ""Why didn't you just stay home""? Some of the other reviews here talk of ""predictability"" in this movie. Are we reviewing the same film (Armored)? To the contrary, this movie is so depressingly unpredictable, that it breaks your heart. Some of the other reviews speak of a ""great story line"", only if you are some law enforcement officer with an axe to grind, I guess. One review speaks of star power at it's peak and ""everyone did a bang-up job"". Again, what movie did you see, because this was a complete waist of star power. I don't even know why Lawrence Fishburne accepted a script like this? Jean Reno's character seems almost catatonic. They did the best they could with what they had to work with script wise, but it was so far beneath what could have been. We all know that crime doesn't pay and you will definitely reap what you sow, but a heist movie should be about the heist, a great getaway, the ensuing chase, the investigation and just maybe the icing on the cake of a total eluding of all who chase them! I'm sorry, if it's not broken, don't fix it! Classic subject scenario's require ""predictability"". If the predictability is anticipated and enjoyable, then it's a bankable asset. In a tangent comparison, people don't seem to care if most popular music sounds the same these days and it does, to it's most boring, mediocre ultimate ever. Society seems to be so tolerant of mediocrity in music, but so intolerant of a little predictability in films; why? It's so backwards. Instead of screwing up the classic ingredient of just enough predictability of a heist movie to keep the enjoyability, it would be nice to bring real music back; music that has interesting progressions, beautiful changes, deep rhythms, bridges and uniqueness (thanks for bearing with my momentary, analytic metaphor). This movie leads you on to think that six blue collar guys, with bills and mortgages, get tired of transporting millions of dollars for their peanut paychecks and decide to cash in for a change, only to get caught up in the most ridiculous, needless, chaotic, foolishness that I have ever seen, in depressing reality. Instead, you end up waiting hopelessly for the scenario to somehow reset from chaos, back to the getaway, but sadly, it never does. The setback becomes the subject matter and spirals relentlessly downward. If you want to see someone (who makes a bad decision to steal) get caught before they even get started, watch ""Cops"". Why not let them shoplift, or steal some ones wallet, or how about a convenience store holdup? Something menial in comparison. Then let them get caught and do they're time (with plenty of action, drama and intensity therein), but $42,000,000.00?? Come on! It's heart wrenching and depressing to watch. I mean really, who enjoys seeing $42 million get blown up?  Where is the slickness, sophistication, smooth execution and intelligence of a well thought out plan, that takes everyone by surprise? The kind that leaves you breathless, wondering ""wow, look at the way they pulled that off""! That is where the excitement, intensity and unpredictability is in a heist picture and this never gets old. It's classic and can be enjoyed over and over. So what if it's ""predictable"" in it's basic story line? SO WHAT?? Some things in life are timeless. At least let them get home with the money James! Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" ( in reference ), is ingenious and a more enjoyable formula for me&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man (Widescreen Edition)</a>. All that said, congratulations are still in order to James V. Simpson for selling ""armored"", his first script. Just please don't write any more about bank jobs and heists James (cause you don't get it) and if you want to write about a hero, don't make him a rat the next time. Really, if this picture was about true morality, then ""Hackett"" (Columbus Short) should have been held responsible for ever agreeing to go along with the heist! He still was part of it and would have left with the money as well, if no one got hurt, right? How does he just go home at the end of it, with a totally clear conscious and a possible reward to boot?? He essentially (though inadvertently) caused his partners deaths, by being such a selfish punk. A far cry from the heart, guts and grit of ""Little Walter"" in Cadillac Records... I am so sorry that I purchased this DVD...",1269561600,17,4885,4.878459687123947

Plenty of action, a good pace, the actors (some seasoned veterans)
all did a bang up job in their roles and the climax pays off big time!
All the elements are tied together by the excellent direction.
This is a like a morality tale / heist film / action thriller that
didn't get a lot of love in the theatres, but is definitely worth
having in your DVD collection if you like gritty action.
This is definitely a GUY'S FILM!! (-:
There are several other reviews on here which break it down and
give you a blow by blow of each scene, etc., so please read them for that.
I don't have time for all that right now...
I just want you all to know that this film is worthwhile and you should

3839868,3,B0021L8UWQ,"""Armored"" is the latest film to arrive on Blu-ray and DVD from director Nimrod Antal's (""Vacancy"") and would feature a screenplay by James V. Simpson, cinematography by Andrzej Sekula (""Vacancy"", ""American Psycho"", ""Hackers"") and music composed by John Murphy (""Miami Vice"", ""Sunshine"", ""28 Weeks Later"").

The film which came out in theaters in Dec. 2009 had a little controversy as the film was accidentally released by Sony on the Playstation Network for free while the film was in theaters and was estimated to have had thousands of downloads.

But this is one of those heist films that benefits from Blu-ray.  Plenty of action, chase scene, explosions and more!

""Armored"" is about a man named Ty Hackett (played by Columbus Short, ""Quarantine"", ""Whiteout"", ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"").  A former marine who is working at an armored truck company but trying to raise his younger brother Jimmy while trying to pay the bills at the house of his deceased parents.

It's been tough since his parents took a double mortgage and the bills are high.  And his co-worker, Mike Cochrone (played by Matt Dillon, ""Crash"", ""Wild things"", ""Deuces Wild"") knows how bad things are for him and knew how bad things were for his father when he worked for the company.

But Mike offers him the way out of debt, by joining him and a few other veteran co-workers which includes Mike's brother-in-law Baines (played by Laurence Fishburne, ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"", ""21', ""The Matrix"" films), Quinn (played by Jean Reno, ""Leon"", ""Ronin"", ""The Pink Panther"" films), Palmer (played by Amaury Nolasco, ""Prison Break"", ""Max Payne"", ""Transformers"") and Dobbs (played by Skeet Ulrich, ""Jericho"", ""Miracles"", ""Scream"") by stealing the money that they are to deliver to a bank.  A total of $42 million.

Ty doesn't want to be part of the heist but with bills mounting and the county wanting to see improvement with his troubled young brother, he needs money and thus decides to join the group as long as no one gets hurt.

All things looks like they are going great for the group as they managed to steal the money but as they try to bury it inside a tunnel in a broken down warehouse.  What they don't know is that a homeless man is watching them.  Immediately, the group catches the homeless man but because he saw their identities, Baines and Mike shoots him down.  Violating their agreement, Ty tries to escape but Mike manages to chase him down and pin him inside one of the armored cars. Ty manages to sound off the siren form the armored car before his co-workers disable it.

Ty uses the security locks to lock himself with the money and hope help comes but his co-workers who fear that the may be caught due to their plan being ruined are now in desperation mode and Mike comes up with an idea, to kill Ty and steal the money but in order to do that, they must get the armored car open.  So, the crew works to remove the hinges from the vehicle in order to get the back door open.

Meanwhile, unknown to the group, an officer named Eckehart (played by Milo Ventimiglia, ""Heroes"", ""Rocky Balboa"") heard the earlier siren and is now heading to the warehouse area to check out the disturbance.

Will Ty be rescued or will be become a victim?

VIDEO:

""Armored"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Day scenes feature a good number of colors but its the closeups that show up quite well on Blu-ray.  The detail of the skin pores and the sweat and grime on some of the armored security is captured well on Blu-ray but as most of the earlier scenes are outdoors and are colorful, the bulk of the film takes place in a run down warehouse.  You can see the detail of the dilapidated warehouse with minimal lining.  Blacks are nice and deep and I don't recall seeing any artifacts or any sign of DNR (digital noise reduction) while watching this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Armored"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Although the film is dialogue driven via the center channel, there is a good amount of front and surround and rear surround channel usage of the special effects.

From the sounds of the shoes of the security, crunching steel during the armored car chase, the sound of the clanging as the men try to open the doors on the vehicle, the sound of the gun/rifle shots.  A lot of the action sequences can be heard all around you and for the most part, lossless audio is very good with this film.  Although not a 100% immersive action-based film, ""Armored"" sports a pretty solid lossless soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Armored"" comes with the following special features in High Definition with English Stereo and optional English subtitles:

  * Audio Commentary by Producer Dan Farah, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia - Usually, you would hear from the director and the producer and talents.  But this time you get a producer comment and commentary from Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia who weren't the main characters.  But Farah talks about scenes that were cut and the guys talk about certain parts of the film and their characters and situations dealing with their characters and a lot of personal conversations.
  * Crash Course: Stunts - (11:30) Lance Gilbert (Stunt coordinator) talks about the stunts in the film especially the car chase.
  * Planning the Heist: Making Of - (15:19) Director Nimrod Antal and the cast talk about working with each other and working on ""Armored"".
  * Armed and Underground: Production Design - (6:47) Jon Gary Steel (Production Designer) talks about the creation of the warehouse and having to build the set and preparing it for major action scenes.
  * movieIQ - With BD-Live, viewers can access the latest information on the cast, crew, music and more via real-time while watching the film.

EXTRAS:

""Armored"" comes with a digital copy of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Right off the bat, you can tell that ""Armored"" is a heist film but where a heist-that-goes-bad. The good news is that the film is quite riveting in terms of a group turning on their co-worker and just watching how things started to snowball.

""Armored"" features quite a good number of talents but if there is one problem with the film, we don't know why they are even involved with the heist.  Obviously, Ty has a reason to be part of it.  The others, we don't know why they want to do it and during the commentary, producer Dan Farah talks about scenes that were cut from the film film.  Personally, it would have been good to know of each character's situation.

So, character execution of the co-workers and their development took a backseat and it surprises me since this film has pretty major talent such as Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburn and several others.  There were some plot issues and questionable dialogue but if anything, I just wished the talent were used much better than they were and at least get to know their motive of wanting to do something this risky, especially if they are married or have a family.

As for the Blu-ray release, you do get a digital copy of the film and the PQ and AQ are pretty good.  It's just that I wish there were more special features or outtakes.  I was surprised to find out that the commentary featured the producer and Skeet Ulrich with Milo Ventimiglia but I suppose the director and the main talent were unavailable for the audio commentary.

Overall, I did enjoy the film for its action sequences and wondering how the character of Ty is going to survive the entire ordeal.  A riveting, action-packed, pulse-pounding heist film! But for the most part, it's more of a B-level action film that has some plot problems, lack of character development (aside from the main character Ty) but in the end, ""Armored"" was a film that I enjoyed more than I was expecting it to be.

Looking for a good popcorn, action flick, definitely give ""Armored"" a try!",1269302400,,7903,4.724087591240876

8349269,3,B0021L8UWQ,"I only heard of this film while seeing an FBI Files show on a L.A. armored car robbery that netted the crooks $18M!  This film came up as being based on that event, which the only similarities is an inside job!  It appears as if the real deal got away with most it!  Other than that, I missed this film and some others from 2009.

I always gauge films by their running time.  The RT tells you a lot about the budget and the quality.  Something always has to give.  As long as it's the budget and not the story, you can kind of get by.  This film seems to have spread out the story and the budget equally.  Examples are: Minimal set usage, a minimal amount of core actors and a truncated story.  There are many films who go over more time than they should (Last Jedi...) and it hurts them.  Then there are those who could have used more time, and this is one of them.  Even an extra 15 minutes would have added a lot to the film.

That 15 minutes would have prevented the story from seeming to be rushed and ultimately leading up to nothing.  The lead bald guy to me, was overacting and I actually HATED his character and characters like his!  He agreed to the heist and all he had to do was follow the plan out, but no - HE caused them all more problems than needed!  One body leads to another!  In every event, I kept thinking that the 'hero' is the cause of all of this and his fear annoyed me!

His constant do-gooder ways was a pain and the movie never showed him any reward for his actions, although in real life this guy would end up behind bars!  Instead, it is Hollywood and what happens happens.  We learn nothing at all about his personal struggles after the main event is over, although they COULD HAVE ended it with a very GREAT ending which could have only taken an extra 3 minutes to film - in the same place!

I'll tell you, I can't understand how I have so much creativity in me and I am sitting at home while those with the opportunity fall so short.  I guess Hollywood is a secret society that only few can join...",1519430400,,2032,4.156410256410257
