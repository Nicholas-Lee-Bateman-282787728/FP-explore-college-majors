2417293,4,B000BHH6BI,"Wonderful DVD full of common sense principles to help explain why children with learning difficulties also have social difficulties and the overlaps. This is for parents, teachers, friends and family as it makes understandable some common behaviour issues and offers good advice and understanding! Great resource!",1252022400,8,313,5.826086956521739
2417294,5,B000BHH6BI,"Your interests should be fairly specific: you have a child with Asperger's syndrome or another similar pervasive-developmental-disorder (although Dr. LaVoie never actually uses these terms).  If you have an interest in these topics, this is an extraordinary presentation!  You can gain an insight into the minds of people who are lacking in the social skills that many of us take for granted.  Highly recommended.  Also read the book for more detail.",1150761600,18,450,5.295774647887324

It took me over a month to get thru the book.  If you are raising an adhd child, you will learn so much.  allow yourself the time to digest all the knowledge presented here.  I watched this video, then read the book.  Our adhd child is a senior in high school.  I wish I'd had this knowlege at my fingertips when he was still in 2nd grade.",1485820800,,506,4.197916666666667
