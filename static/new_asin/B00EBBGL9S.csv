5901071,4,B00EBBGL9S,I gave this as a gift for someone else. She rated both movies as 4 STAR. She said she liked them very much. This is good because one or two other 9/11 movies I had seen had been disappointing.,1391990400,2,192,3.948717948717949

8603455,5,B00EBBGL9S,This is just one story of how 9-11 touched families and this maybe fictional yet I am certain many struggled with the events of that day. Such a sense of loving parents and a mother watching her son struggle. The acting was wonderful and moving. So hope that in time these wounds will heal and that those touched by that day will find healing. One can only hope that those left had someone to care and watch over them,1401580800,3,417,4.291139240506329
