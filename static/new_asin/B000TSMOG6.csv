8210695,5,B000TSMOG6,"In Yu Yu Hakusho: Seven Sins you will get 14 terrific episodes of the great show on two DVDs. Specifically, this set contains episodes 85 upto and including 98. The first ten conclude the Chapter Black or Sensui Saga while the remaining four begin the Saga of the Three Kings. If you haven't already seen the earlier episodes, do not read on to my review.

The battle between Yusuke and Sensui has begun. At first, Yusuke holds his own, but Sensui reveals a shocking twist - he has 7 different personalities! As Koenma arrives and attempts to stop him using the Mafuken, a powerful defensive spell made up of Koenma's stored energy in his pacifier for hundreds of years, Sensui reveals his truest and most powerful form - Shinobu. Shinobu has mastered a third type of energy called Sacred Energy which not even Genkai could master. Realizing he's outclassed, Yusuke makes the ultimate sacrifice for his friends and dies...again!

Reaching a new level of power, Hiei, Kurama, and Kuwabara attempt to avenge their fallen friend. As they attack him, Sensui lures them into Demon World for a final showdown. Meanwhile, King Yama attempts to have Yusuke's body destroyed, but why? Yusuke is in fact a Mazoku, the descendant of a powerful demon ancestor! As the dormant demon blood awakens with him, Yusuke is revived. With a new level of power, he travels to Demon World to resume his fight with Sensui.

Their battle is intense and both appear to be fighting as equals. But somewhere inside Yusuke a change occurs and he begins to hear a voice until he is eventually transformed. A mysterious demon takes over his body and deals Sensui a killing blow. It is here that Sensui's true nature is revealed. All this time Sensui wished to travel to Demon World to atone for his killing of so many demons. He wished for a powerful demon to kill him. Ultimately, Sensui is redeemed by Yusuke, as before his death Shinobu casts out his other 6 personalities and gains peace of mind. Thanks to Yusuke, his soul is at least partly saved. Truly a tragic character, Sensui is ultimately helped by Yusuke in a very similar way as Toguro.

Yusuke, furious that he was not in control when he defeated Sensui, reluctantly returns to the human world. The Saga ends with an epilogue explaining the fates of the remaining Psychics, Chapter Black, Sensui, and Koenma. Yusuke is soon visited by Hokushin, an S class demon and follower of Yusuke's ancestor Raizen, one of the three kings of Demon World and the one who earlier possessed Yusuke. As Yusuke learns of the power balance in Demon World, he decides to go there and meet and train with Raizen. Elsewhere, both Hiei and Kurama also travel to Demon World to meet the other kings - Mukuro and Yomi. Which king will reign over all?

Overall 14 great episodes at a great price. The Yusuke vs. Sensui fight is one of my all time favorites. The volume ends with you wanting more as the Saga of the Three Kings is just beginning, but our show will soon end. As usual, extras are non existant and the subtitles only cover the Japanese version. Still, if you are a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, this set is a must get.",1191974400,5,3133,4.617594254937163
