662239,5,6303478336,"This is also the ONLY Zorro serial dealing with the original Zorro character, set in the original time period (early 1800's).  The serial is very well made.  Reed Hadley is an excellent Don Diego/Zorro.  The sword fighting scenes are very impressive.  The cliffhangers at the end of each chapter are excellently done.  Don Del Oro is one of the greatest movie serial villians of all time.  If you are a fan of the Zorro legend or of movie serials in general, this is one of the best.  A must have!",958521600,2,497,4.455555555555556
662240,4,6303478336,"First, Amazon must be congratulated for stocking vintage serials available on Video. ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" has always been one of my favourites from my child hood days. To be able to add this to my video  collection is a dream come true. As this is one of John English and William  Witney's best efforts.  No other Zorro serial portrayed such an accurate  version of this famous character. In this one, Don Diego alias Zorro is a  sword-wielding swashbuckling hero and not a six-gun-toting cowboy as it  were in the later Zorro serials. The star, Reed Hadley is perfect for the  title role, and it is unfortunate that there were no sequels to this grand  serial, as it would have been fabulous seeing Hadley ride again as Zorro.  Each episode is jam-packed with action and ends with a spectacular  cliff-hanger. It also features brilliant stunt work and great atmospheric  music.  Definitely deserves a space in any collector's library.  One gripe  though, why are the Republic serials not available on DVD? They should  follow the footsteps of Universal who made the Flash Gordon Trilogy  available in this format.",954201600,2,1119,4.935483870967742
662241,2,6303478336,I first saw ZFL on tv in 1953 when the networks were looking to fill time slots. Yakima Canutt's one of a kind stunt in chapter 7- falling under the moving stagecoach convinced me that I wanted to be a stuntman when I grew  up. The climax- Don Diego and Don Del Oro in hand-to-hand combat- rolling  around the floor of the ceremonial cave until Zorro pulls off the Golden  God's helmut revealing ?  as the villian. I've seen all of Republic's  serials & none show the hero & villian fighting it out during the  conclusion. The very best serial ever. ZFL ranks as my favorite movie of  the century. Look how often scenes for modern movies have been taken from  ZFL. I highly recommend it. 5 stars- the very best rating.,947376000,3,718,4.386363636363637
662242,4,6303478336,"""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" (1939) remains one of the great serials with its impressive cast, energetic direction and first-rate action sequences.  Reed Hadley is terrific as Don Diego/Zorro, while Don Del Oro emerges as a classic villain. When it came to serials, Republic Pictures was second to  none in terms of quality - and ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" is Saturday  matinee escapism of the highest calibre.",938995200,14,406,5.3125
662243,3,6303478336,"There have been four serials made that use the actual ""ZORRO"" name and two or three that use a character similar to Zorro, but this 1938 chapterplay is the only one with the one and ONLY Zorro! With Zorro played by Reed Hadley, Republic's original story takes Zorro to Mexico after Juarez's successful revolution aainst Spain to stop the reincarnated Yaqui god Don Del Oro from stealing much needed gold and fomenting a Yaqui uprising.  The twelve chapters of this serial keep Zorro and his Fighting Legion in continual peril from Don Del Oro and his Yaqui followers, and trying to deduce which one of four evil councillors is Don del Oro will keep everyone guessing until the final chapter!  One of Republic's best serials ever and a worthy addition to the Zorro legend.  END",900979200,8,776,4.733333333333333
662467,5,6303478336,"This is easily the best of the several Zorro serials, and one of the best serials of any kind.  The cliffhangers are superb, and William Witney and John English's direction is superb as usual.  Reed Hadley appeared in films for 35 years, often as a Western bad guy--I've noticed him in that kind of role with Hopalong Cassidy.  In his career Hadley also did a lot of radio acting, including Red Ryder on the radio.  In this film he strikes just the right combination of fop and daredevil as Don Diego and Zorro, respectively.

Sheila Darcy (1914-2004) plays Volita, who is always disgusted with Diego because he's such a wimp.  She appeared in just one other serial, ""Terry and the Pirates,"" in which she played the Dragon Lady, and about 30 other films from the mid-1930's to the early 1940's.

One reason for the excellence of this film is the work of the world's best-known stunt man, Yakima Canutt.  His most famous stunt was pulled off in this very film, where he (doubling Zorro) falls under the hooves of the racing horses pulling a stagecoach, slides under the coach, pulls himself up on the back of it, and punches out the driver.  Canutt also did this in ""Stagecoach,"" and Steven Spielberg stole it for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" using a truck instead of a stagecoach.  You'll find it in Chapter Seven; look closely and you'll see that Canutt bounces a little under the coach, and they had to do it twice to complete the scene.  It really was death-defying!

The only negative I could find was the silly ending, where the villain is revealed and he almost unaccountably falls into his own firepit.  You'll get a little tired of hearing that opening song in every chapter, but in case you want to sing along here are the words:

  We ride

  With wind over hill, over dale

  With a spirit that cannot fail

  Men of Zorro are we.

  We ride!",1137283200,2,1851,4.527272727272727

This seems an odd choice on their part, considernig all chapter recaps were left in on their Painted Stallion, and New Adventures of Tarzan DVD's.

7848503,5,6303478336,"""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" is a 12-chapter serial released by Republic Pictures in 1939, directed by William Witney and John English.

In 1824, shortly after Mexican independence, Benito Ju&aacute;rez (Carleton Young) has come from Mexico City to address the Council of San Mendolito, stressing the importance of gold from their mine to the survival of the republic.  A Yaqui God, Don Del Oro, has apparently come to life, rousing the Indians to attack the gold shipments and promising to lead them in recovering their land, but he is actually a member of the Council who wants to become Emperor of Mexico.  Don Francisco Vega (Guy D'Ennery) has organized a group of patriots, and volunteers to guard the next gold shipment, but after the Council meeting he is attacked and killed despite the intervention of Zorro, his nephew, Don Diego Vega (Reed Hadley) who has just arrived from California.

This is the best-produced of Republic's ""Zorro"" serials, faithful to the character created by Johnston McCulley, though he might not have had the Legion sing as they ride, which fortunately only happens a few times other than during the credits.  The plot is uncomplicated, with some attention paid to historical detail, though the writers got creative by including Benito Ju&aacute;rez, who was 18 years old in 1824 and hardly the ""one who more than anyone else helped establish Mexican freedom,"" as he is introduced at the Council meeting.  Reed Hadley makes a fine Zorro, and a more reserved and believable Don Diego Vega than is often the case.  He is aided by his servant, Juan (Budd Buster) who does some undercover work, and by Ramon (William Corson), another member of the Council and friend of Don Diego's late uncle.  Ramon's sister, Volita (Sheila Darcy) mostly expresses disgust toward Don Diego and praise for Zorro, but needs to be rescued in one chapter.  The Council has four members who might be Don Del Oro; Governor Felipe (Leander De Cordova), Commandante Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and the operator of the mine, Manuel Gonzalez (Edmund Cobb).  Chief henchman Moreno is played by Jim Pierce, best known to serial fans as Prince Thun of the Lion Men in ""Flash Gordon,"" and a number of other familiar faces show up in smaller roles, including Charles King, Jerry Frank, Jason Robards, Sr., Thodore Lorch and Hal Taliaferro.

While one of Republic's better serials, video editions suggest that the surviving materials have a few problem areas.  My initial disappointment with these DVD's was likely due to a recent viewing of VCI's superb transfer of Republic's 1940 serial ""King of the Royal Mounted;"" fortunately the main problems with prints of ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" are in the opening credits, most of which seem to be from reduction prints with the focus going soft toward the corners.  The actual chapters are considerably better.

Roan/Troma's edition, # AED-2081, claiming to be ""Digitally Remastered From the Finest Elements"" has a reasonably sharp image, and if the contrast is a little low the gray scale is good enough to follow the action even in the darker scenes.  There are only a few minor film defects, and from the MPPDA certificate numbers all of the opening credits are from the chapters to which they are attached except the last, taken from Chapter Four, the same substitution that was made on Republic's Laserdisc.  Roan's sound is loud and fairly clear, with a little distortion occasionally that seems to be present in all editions, a ""chopped"" quality at the frame rate.  The only ""extra"" feature related to the serial is a ""film background,"" which is mostly biographical information on Reed Hadley, though they also include the first chapter of the 1952 serial ""Radar Men from the Moon.""

VCI's edition, # 8371, or in ""Zorro's Cliffhanger Collection"" # 8342 is now issued on a double-layer DVD-R.  The image is of similar quality to Roan's, with a bit more contrast if the source print wasn't quite as clean.  The sound is not as loud but also of decent quality within limits of available prints.  Seven chapters have the opening credits from other chapters, with the wrong MPPDA numbers, most from Chapter Five where the image was fairly sharp.  There are ""Bios"" of Reed Hadley, Sheila Darcy and directors William Witney and John English.  VCI also includes some ""trailers"" but these are advertisements for their box sets of television programs, ""Stories of the Century,"" ""I Married Joan,"" ""Terry and the Pirates"" and ""My Little Margie.""  This is also a good edition, for those with players that work with the double-layer ""burned"" media.  Newer ones should list ""DVD+R DL"" and ""DVD-R DL"" in the instruction manual as compatible disc types; other players may work, but some will fail to recognise the discs or even experience lock-ups.

Still available from some dealers, the Hal Roach / Image DVD, # HRS 9463 was advertised as ""Mastered from Original 35mm Nitrate Camera Negative and Fine Grains.""  It has good contrast and gray scale, but most of it was transferred with excessive sharpness ""enhancement"" causing outlines on people and objects and a ""bas-relief"" effect in fine patterns, such as shrubbery.  Some jitter is seen, made more obvious if the picture is enlarged.  Both problems go away, eighteen and a half minutes into the first chapter at the second reel change, and the picture is fine for the rest of the chapter, but the problems return in the rest of the serial.  The opening credits are mostly substituted from other chapters, with the last eight from Chapter Five.  Some filtering was done on the sound, but it remains reasonably clear, and it was patched to correct a few minor dropouts present in the other editions.  Trailers from six Republic serials are included, for ""Darkest Africa,"" ""Radar Men from the Moon,"" ""Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island,"" ""SOS Coast Guard,"" ""The Undersea Kingdom"" and ""Zorro Rides Again.""

Alpha's edition, # ALP 5562D is better than many of their releases, but the image is blurry enough to be obvious during the chapters and the small print is mostly unreadable in the opening credits.  Video noise due to compression artifacts, ""digital grain"" is visible even on a small display.  While gray scale and contrast are mostly adequate, highlights tend to burn out in the last chapters though faces don't go completely blank.  The sound is a little lacking in high frequencies but not badly distorted.  A surprise, Alpha does not put their logo on-screen during the credits.  It is now supplied on a double-layer DVD-R, with the same playback concerns as VCI's.

This is a fine serial, with the Roan/Troma and VCI editions better than the others.  Alpha's is cheap, but so is VCI's in the package with ""Zorro Rides Again"" and ""Zorro's Black Whip.""  But as with any serial, a day or so between chapters keeps the plot from seeming redundant, and on this one gives the Fighting Choristers a rest.",1374278400,4,6926,4.961904761904762

7848507,5,6303478336,"I watch a lot of serials, and Republic's are the ones by which all others are measured.  This particular serial is in very good archival condition.  The quality of the transfer to DVD is excellent.  I'm guessing, but it probably looks about 85-90% as good as it did when it was first shown in the theaters.  The production values are first rate, as I have come to expect from Republic.  Hadley makes both an excellent fop/dandy and Zorro.  The golden god is nicely costumed, well-voiced, sufficiently mysterious and menacing.  The special effects are excellent, as are the soundtrack and photography.  The plot is easier to follow than those serials that come from the school of ""more is better"", and feel it necessary to throw in everything except the kitchen sink.  After awhile, you're buried in plot devices and far too many characters.  It can be headache-inducing.  Not so with this serial.  Very enjoyable and very well done!  Future western feature films and TV series owe some of their success to this 1939 Republic serial.",1170374400,,1032,4.862068965517241
