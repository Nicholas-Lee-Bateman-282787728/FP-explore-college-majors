2345282,5,B000A0GXRO,"I'm not going to lie... I'm a huge Jimmy Fallon fan. I was a little skeptical coming into this movie because if any of you Jimmy Fallon fans saw Taxi knew that his acting in Taxi sucked and that it was one of the worst movies. But in Fever Pitch Jimmy definately showed that he's an actor as well as a comedian. He played the part well and you could tell that he enjoyed playing it and that he was more comfortable in his role. Its generally a great movie, and again I wasn't expecting that. It has a little bit for everyone - A romantic comedy for the girls and a sports comedy for the guys. Its a great movie to watch with date as well. I never found myself bored or wanting the plot to move on, which happens in some movies. It's a fun movie to watch and I recommend it to everyone, even the guys who think its a chick flick.",1124668800,,828,4.024242424242424
2345283,4,B000A0GXRO,"Fever Pitch (re-titled The Perfect Catch in the UK) is based on a British movie called, drum roll please- Fever Pitch. In the British version it was about a guy who fell in love with a girl, but who wasn't sure which meant more to him out of her and his favorite sport football (soccer). This time round with Hollywood stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, the sport is baseball. And that's basically all you need to know for now.

This is a nice typical romantic movie directed by the Farrelly brothers. It has been claimed in at least one critic review that romance is a new genre for the Farrelly brothers- obviously those critics haven't seen ""Shallow Hal""- which was hilarious by the way.

I've been trying to decide whether to give this movie 3 or 4 stars. I've ultimately been kind and given it 4 stars, but the thing to note about this movie is that it is slightly funny and not hilarious, pretty romantic but not overly romantic- it seems to keep missing the mark, thus hindering its chance of being a really great romantic comedy. Still, love the work of our two leads.

And as an additional sidenote: You don't have to know anything about Baseball to be able to enjoy it.",1123286400,,1183,4.467592592592593
2345284,4,B000A0GXRO,"Myself, being a big fan of the Farrelly brothers was looking forward to this and I really enjoyed it. It definitely isn't as good as Dumb and Dumber, Me Myself and Irene or the untouchable comedy masterpiece There's something about Mary, but it still was funny. The movie was a lot more appropriate than the others as it was a sweet movie that had funny but appetizing jokes. The movie is about a man who's completely obsessed with the Red Sox and he basically must choose between the Sox and his one true love. Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore were great for their roles and this movie was funny and at the same time appropriate and doesn't go over the gross meter. A definitely worthy rent.",1120262400,,691,4.492063492063492
2345411,5,B000A0GXRO,"Baseballs been around for a long time, a lot longer than even women, so you can forgive guys everywhere like Ben Wrightman (played by an affable Jimmy Fallon) for being adult children still pining after their first loves until their last out six months a year. And so Ben is in love, in love with the great game, and with a cursed team (the Boston Red Sox), and with the yearly promise of the possible but improbable marriage of a phenomenal season that will wed his team with World Series winners rings. But is that any way to live?

The movie makes you wonder when cute and quirky Lindsey Meeks (slant-mouthed darling Drew Barrymore) meets Ben and the two begin a cautious relationship. But how dare a woman get in the way of a mans first love? And Lindsey is in for a shock in finding out just how deep Bens love runs, and as any incomplete woman will do Lindsey draws a line of chalk in the sand for Ben: its either her or his first love. Oh, why oh why do women always do this!?! Ask the excruciatingly confused guys who find that they are 60/40 attracted to sports/girls and think that if they play the field right then they can somehow have both.

Well, ironically, thats what Ben and Lindsey get when he is willing to give up his first love (baseball) for his new and different love (Lindsey) while Lindsey realizes that shes loved only when she sees Ben give up his first love and so realizes that she cant really love him if she requires him to give up his first love. Whew! Baseball statistics are easier to understand than all of that love mush!

Throwing a real curveball into this film was that it was filmed in a year where the Boston Red Sox actually went to and won the World Series (2004) after more than an 80 year drought and suffering under the curse of the Bambino. That made for a magical year of baseball, and made Fever Pitch all the more compelling a romantic comedy. It helped to hit it out of the park.",1506470400,,1930,4.3259668508287294

2345485,5,B000A0GXRO,"What I expected: A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.
What I got: An even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.
Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works! Barrymore is classic Barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong, and adorable. We expect that from her and she delivered.
But Fallon is the nice surprise in this film. He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life, like caring about kids and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can be caring (""You just ran across the field for me!"") and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the Red Sox (""How did the grass feel? Kinda spongy?"") at the same time. Fallon's portrayal ""made"" the movie. Hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (i.e. Will Ferrell).
In short, a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon.
Hey, I saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as I did. It's neither a ""Guy Flick"" nor a ""Chick Flick"". It's a terrific make-you-laugh flick. Go see it!",1474243200,4,1726,4.795302013422819

They movie itself is very good. Fallon plays a Die-hard Red Sox fan and Barrymore plays a women trying to climb the cooperate ladder. Out of the dozen baseball movies I watched, this one wasn't the best. But, it did stand out on its own against the others. It isn't your typically love story, which is respectable.

They complemented each other so well in this movie.  Personally, I can relate to this story since I began my teaching career in a high school math classroom, and even coached baseball at a middle school for four years during my career.  To carry my own story a little bit farther, one of the highlights of my honeymoon back in 1976 was getting to see a double header in Atlanta involving the Braves and Montreal Expos.  So I too like Fallon's character have a passion for Major League Baseball and in particular my San Francisco Giants.

I remember the year this movie is about --2004-- when the Red Sox spectacularly came from behind 3 games to 0 to beat the Yankees in the ALC and then went on to win the World Series, after an 86 year drought. The breaking of the Bambino Curse! This movie is hilariously funny. You should listen carefully to the dialogue, especially at the ballpark, and enjoy all the typical gripes and complaints that come out of the mouths of fanatic fans.

2346182,5,B000A0GXRO,Drew Barrymore was great in this movie.  Jimmy Fallon was also excellent and shows his versatility as an entertainer.  I was not aware that Jimmy Fallon acted in movies prior to being a late night television host.  This is funny yet believable story of the life of an avid baseball fan...regardless of whatever team one loves.  It's a feel-good movie.  It's a great movie to get ready to celebrate another baseball season!!!!,1389052800,,425,4.847222222222222

Lets cut to the chase... This movie should be a must see for any die hard Red Sox fan...Even a nominal one that barely knows who they are will enjoy it.  It is clever, moves very quickly, funny in many places, and finally near the end gets poignant with a wonderful ending to it.  It's actually done in an around Fenway Park like not other movies I have ever come across.  A true winner in every way, even if you have never had any use for the Sox at all.  Highly recommended to the ladies who will enjoy the gathering romance, and for the men who will get into the hilarious over the top baseball fan angle...:)",1386288000,,785,4.241610738255034

You could get an MLB highlight video, blah, blah... Or get Fallon and Barrymore with a fun, funny supporting cast, great Boston music and scenery, a great love story Set IN THAT GLORIOUS Red Sox Revival YEAR!!!

P.S. check that Amazon is the seller.  Had a different seller first time around and the DVD case was scratched up.",1385078400,,461,4.364705882352941
2346221,3,B000A0GXRO,A very mediocre but endearing flick.  Once was enough but my 10 year old nephew loves all things baseball. Thank you.,1382659200,,117,4.571428571428571

2346223,5,B000A0GXRO,"Okay, I will admit that I grew up at Fenway Park and our seats were 4 rows behind the Boston on deck circle. We moved away when I was 15 and the Red Sox still have a very special place in my heart. I also have to fess up that I think Jimmy Fallon is a multi-talented gift to any TV program, movie, or internet clip out there.

That being said, Fever Pitch is a smartly written movie that appeals to anyone who is looking for a great romantic comedy with a wicked fun twist into the world of baseball, specifically Red Sox baseball. Drew Barrymore pulls off the driveness of a woman animus possessed whose luck is to meet a man whose passion ends up providing both love and balance to her life. Very funny with great detail: I envy the set designer who got to shop for Jimmy's apartment. Casting is spot on including Jimmy's his equally Red Sox obsessed pals, the ""neighbors"" at Fenway, and Drew's girlfriends who kibitz while working out or having lunch. The footage from Fenway is wonderful although a little bumpy at the end due to additional shots necessary to the movie the year it was filmed. But you gotta love why!

How exuberant is my recommendation? As tall and wide as the Green Monster and as fun and tasty as anything you may find on Yawkey Way. I bought this baby and plan to give it a watch whenever I need a laugh, a sigh, or a trip down memory lane. Enjoy my Amazon friends, you can't go wrong with this fabulous film.",1381708800,,1434,4.287822878228782

2346227,5,B000A0GXRO,A takeoff of the British movie of the same name but adapted towards baseball rather than soccer. I'm a Red Sox fan anyway and this was a neat way to see a true fan's devotion to the Sox during the awesome World Series run.,1378166400,,222,4.068181818181818

She personified her character with wonderful, believable
facial expressions that were so genuine.  A great family movie...fun to watch!  You felt good after watching it.  Why doesn't Hollywood get it?  These kind of movies are too few.",1377734400,,549,5.218390804597701

The relationship was realistic...girlfriends trying to talk her out of it, his buddies telling him to go for it, and no way could he give up his seats for her.  It was great!  Loved it.

2346361,4,B000A0GXRO,"This movie was a cute and funny romance comedy.  The baseball team, the Red Sox, was thankfully a backdrop to the story.  It's rightful focus was Fallon and Barrymore's romance.  I'm an Angel and Padre fan.  I'm a fan of them both because I've lived in San Diego for for years, and I've lived very close by to the Angels most of my life (was even at one of the 2002 world series games).  I was impressed with how the Farrelly bros were able to film during the Red Sox games.  These scenes were pretty good.  I especially liked how they had Drew run onto the field during a game.

The Farrelly brothers created a good sports, romance, and comedy movie.  If this was supposed to be loosely based off of Nick Hornby's book I don't know.  I haven't read Nick's books, but they are on my to read list.

Jimmy Fallon was actually likeable - and I find him annoying on his late night show.  If you think his obsession for the Red Sox team was exaggerated - you're wrong.  Some sports fans are very much like him.  My mother almost comes close.  She thinks the Angel's manager can hear her when she yells at the tv.  Fallon was actually perfect for this role. Fallon and the character Ben Wrightman are both goofy and child-like.  Ben is a math teacher who gets along great with kids and in my opinion it's because he is one.

Drew Barrymore's performance I loved.  She plays Lindsey Meeks, who is a top notch business woman.  Her character is very strong and likeable.  Lindsey's lifestyle is different from Ben's.  For one, she's not a Red Sox fan.  Another difference is that she's more mature than he is.  But their romance does work.  I really liked Drew's character the most.",1349827200,,1673,4.406557377049181

2346370,4,B000A0GXRO,"We love this movie and just watched it again last night for Valentine's Day, and it was the perfect fit.  We hadn't seen it since it was in the theaters, so it was fresh and funny all over again.

Both leads do a great job, particularly Jimmy Fallon.  Not that Drew Barrymore isn't great, but we've come to expect that from her, so the performance by Jimmy Fallon was a refreshing surprise.  Yes, he's doing his lovable, funny, stuttering schtick, but it works, and he has moments of real emotion, as well.

The romance angle is a little broad, with her as the hard-driving, upwardly mobile professional woman (complete with her pack of predictably diverse girlfriends/drinking-workout partners) and him as the cool school teacher who lives for his one passion, the Red Sox (complete with his pack of predictably diverse friends/season-ticket leeches).

When they meet, he's in 'Winter Guy' mode, and they spend a few months developing a romantic relationship.  However, once Spring Training starts up he switches to 'Summer Guy' mode, and his obsession with the Sox begins to manifest itself into their relationship.

Hilarity ensues, as they say, along with some rom-com level drama.  The interesting twist for this film is that it is set and was filmed during the Red Sox successful run for the World Series title in 2004.  They adapt the vanquishing of 'The Curse' into the plot of the film, and it adds a touch of realism not normally found in most rom-coms.

A very enjoyable film, even more so on repeat viewing, where it held up remarkably well.  Highly recommended.",1329264000,,1574,4.853932584269663

2346383,3,B000A0GXRO,"Lefty Gomez often said, ""I'd rather be lucky than good."" Under ordinary circumstances, ""Fever Pitch"" would not have worked for me, but due to circumstances beyond the Farrelly's control, it did and does. ""Fever Pitch"" is a sometimes cute, sometimes sweet, sometimes touching but uneven romantic comedy about obsessions, compromise and compassion. It is also an ode to the Red Sox and their fans. It has some very good moments, like when young Ben first sees Fenway Park or the Opening Day sequence when Lindsey (the luminous Drew Barrymore) starts to see what all the fuss is about.  But, it can't seem to control the urge to be crude or over-the-top. So, it tends to veer wildly from sweet to juvenile and cartoonish. Also, the movie could have been an enjoyable family movie if not for unnecessary sexual references and non-explicit sexual situations. But, it gets to me, and I'm not a member of Red Sox nation, although I love baseball. The movie's romcom comeback would have been entirely forgettable for me except for its being linked to ""the greatest comeback in sports history"".

The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon is impeccable, and the script was entirely clever. I have to respect that they made me interested in baseball without ever having been interested in that sport at all.

2346389,1,B000A0GXRO,"Giving yet more fodder to the belief that women only want to be barefoot and pregnant, 'Lindsey' throws away a, long-sought and fought for, promotion in order to be with a man.  A man who could have found any number of women who are as fanatical about the Red Sox as he is.  But no.  It's not enough for 'Ben' to utterly ignore 'Lindsey' except for sex, (even when she is knocked unconscious by a foul ball, he ignores her until the caught ball is celebrated).  Oh ha ha ha she has to have a CT scan of her head.  Big deal.

Even though 'Ben' could have hooked up with any of the women who knew him well because he held lifetime seats at Fenway, they weren't good enough for him.  My take on this is that he didn't like women at all, and that it was only by seeking women who would reject him, until, that is, he found the ""right"" one whose life he could destroy, so that he could find balance.  I don't see this as much different from psychotic behavior -- (someone who knows films well, and writes about them, could give many examples).

That this kind of movie would be made in the 21st century is nauseating.  That Drew Barrymore agreed to be in it - - even moreso. That so many people claim to have enjoyed this movie is very, very disturbing.  Good thing 'Ben' was able to make a 'whole' woman out of 'Lindsey'.  I hope that lots of employers watch this movie because that will give them added incentive to only promote men, and to pay men more than women for the same job -- why not?  The women just want to get knocked up.

2346414,5,B000A0GXRO,"Although it's been a few years since I viewed this film, a recent barrage of disparaging remarks from both my friends as well as other voices on the Internet has motivated me to write what I would consider a fair review of this underappreciated classic.

First off I should start by saying that I am not a huge Jimmy Fallon fan.  However, his level-headed performance in this comedic gem has won me over.  Drew Barrymore also turns in a fairly atypical sterling performance, and the chemistry between the two makes Fever Pitch a highly enjoyable film.

I watched the movie with my girlfriend who is a die-hard Red Sox fan.  As a fan of DC/Baltimore area sports teams, I had mixed feelings going into the viewing.  However, like the rest of the country, the memorable run to the World Series by the 2004 Red Sox captivated me.  As a life-long baseball fanatic, I'll never forget how surreal it was to see Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore out on the field after the World Series. The incessant replays of Fallon--which were ubiquitous on Sportscenter during the following year--served to pique my interest in viewing this film.  I have to disagree with my all-time favorite writer Bill Simmons when he criticizes the filmmaker's ""lack of respect"" for the game.  I believe having such a quintessentially historic moment on film only serves to further cement the legacy of the 2004 Red Sox.  I even found myself donning a Red Sox cap by the end of the movie, much to my roommates' chagrin.

Obviously, the sports film is the perfect vehicle for a romantic comedy because of its cross-gender appeal.  That said, there aren't a lot of films that are able to pull it off without a hitch (Forget Paris stands out as one of the few to do so).  Fever Pitch is not unlike an acquired taste in this respect.  My former roommate, for instance, constantly taunts me for having enjoyed this film.  I typically refute his accusations by claiming I have never seen it, as it is obvious to me that my passion for this picture is a pleasure some will never learn to appreciate.  Considering his taste in entertainment, (Smallville, MacGyver, some show about a supersonic helicopter with Ernest Borgnine, etc.) I feel more than secure in my opinion of Fever Pitch being a romantic classic.

I can't recommend this movie enough as a ""date film.""  The touching romance between Fallon and Barrymore coupled with the storied 2004 Red Sox Pennant is a potent aphrodisiac no one can resist.  Thanks to a single viewing, I now count myself as a faithful member of ""Red Sox Nation,"" and as an Irishman, I've added a Red Sox cap to my weekly rotation of baseball teams I pretend to follow.",1275436800,8,2659,4.667381974248927

2346416,5,B000A0GXRO,"I recently purchased this item. I got it because I am a hardcore Red Sox fan... still can't believe I didn't buy this before!

The plot is quite simple... boy meets (out his league) girl, girl falls in love, and then... the worst thing ever... he's a baseball obsessed guy!!! Ok, ok, a bit of a twist. What I loved about this movie, it gives a parallels of what was going on in my life that year. The best thing about this film was that it was shot ""real time"" meaning they had two endings, one where the Sox lost, and the actual ending (YAY!)

If you're a Red Sox fan, get ready to relieve all those moments, the losses the wins (that FANTASTIC win against NEW YORK YANKEES!), as much as it is a chick-flick, baseball is a big (huge) part of the movie... so guys will enjoy it as well. Funny, lovable characters. Drew Barrymore doing what she does best: making us fall in love with her. Jimmy Fallon, as the adorable crazy fan! (the scene where he's at Spring Training is EPIC! hahaha). All in all, great movie, simple plot, funny.

There has never been and in all likelihood never will again be such an heroic comeback that the Red Sox demonstrated in that unforgettable year.

This movie captures the flavor, and in minutiae, the excitement generated by this never-say-die team of superb athletes. Jimmy Fallon is an excellent microcosm of the avid Bostonian fan, who for years saw their team come close to winning the World Series, but in the end came up short. Drew Barrymore gives a fine performance as the at first understanding then gradually disenchanted girlfriend. Together they light up the screen with both their comedic talents and romantic sensiblilities.

Call it what you will: a very good date flick, a singularly nostalgic trip down memory lane, an escape to what baseball can do one's psyche, or any or all of the above. In short, it is and was a timely piece of filmmaking.",1272844800,,1127,4.686868686868687

2346420,4,B000A0GXRO,"Okay, okay, FEVER PITCH is a romcom, but when the backdrop is the greatest game ever invented I'm on board and intent.  And being a long-suffering Cubs fan I readily identify with Jimmy Fallon's character's lustful addiction to his beloved Red Sox.  When baseball is the focal point of existence winter is merely a hiatus; I so get that.  Anyways, the stars must have been in perfect alignment for the Farrelly brothers as they filmed Fallon and a very scrumptious Drew Barrymore in character at the immortal Fenway at the same time the BoSox made their improbable postseason run into magical history.  It's yet another dimension making this movie so much fun.

Barrymore and Fallon play well off one another; Barrymore as a career-oriented workaholic, Fallon as a teacher by day and baseball junkie by night.  When a spark between the two ensues, it is Fallon's character who suddenly realizes there's more to life--much, much more--than baseball.  The romance has its predictable ups and downs, then its breakup, then its dramatic makeup; yet even though the viewer knows exactly what's going to happen FEVER PITCH is still grand fun due to its BoSox enhancement.  Plus the scene showing Fallon and his buds deciding who gets which of the rare allotment of season tickets had me rolling on the floor; heck, Fallon is given a plethora of great one-liners that he delivers with tongue-in-cheek chutzpah.  Yeah, FEVER PITCH is a romcom, but it's a baseball romcom.  Which makes it a winner on my scoreboard.

""Fever Pitch"" is sweet, funny, and packs a pretty darn good message about relationships and priorities.  Fallon and Barrymore have wonderful chemistry.  The story balances detailed side characters without going overboard.  In fact, all the characters are properly quirky.  The film flows well with plenty of romance and laughs, and who can resist that overall devotion to the spirit of baseball?

Though at times I am one of those geeks that has to have every little detail on the DVD, I'm quite happy with the bare essentials this has--including a trailor and various documentaries.  It's all done very well and kept in the same spirit of the movie itself.

This is a handy little DVD, and the movie should appeal to baseball fanatics and hopeless romantics alike.",1219017600,4,1119,4.836842105263158
2346460,5,B000A0GXRO,"I am a true Yankee fan and although the Red Sox are now our biggest rivals I still enjoyed this movie.  I had to close my eyes at the end for a few seconds when they showed the Red Sox comeback in the AL Championship series.

Because the Red Sox our biggest American League rival people think it was always that way.  But it wasn't.  When I grew up in the 1950s the Red Sox had great hitters like Ted Williams and Pete Runnels.  But they were never a contender.  The Yankees rivals were the Indians and White Sox, the only two teams to beat them out for the American League pennant.  But those rivalries were nothing compared to the Brooklyn Dodger vs New York Yankee rivarly that develop when they meet in the World Series 4 times in the decade.

In this movie Jimmy Fallon meets Drew Barrymore and falls in love with her.  But this happens in the winter and the true Red Sox fanaticism doesn't really come until baseball season.  She gets a hint when she see how his apartment looks like Fenway Park.  But the true understanding doesn't hit until she see him with friends on ESPN while they were down in Florida watching for the new prospects.

The theme of the story is all about her finding time for a man in her life and we see how this very succesful woman is embarrassed when she is caught sleeping on the job.  For Fallon it is about finding time for her with his busy schedule attendiing Red Sox games.  He inherited two season tickets and before the season starts he and his friends get to decide who gets to go with him for these games.  With Drew in his life he picks her to go with him to the most important games.  One day he had to miss a game for a dinner appointment with her parents.

The last straw seems to be when he hesitates about taking a trip with her to Paris because the Sox would be in town.  In the end he is depressed and decides to sell his tickets and show her that he would give up the Red Sox for her.  If you go see it watch how it plays out.  It is very funny and romantic.

For me the most interesting part was that it was filmed during the 2004 season and so as they filmed the outcome was in doubt because it hinged on how the Red Sox would do.  The soap opera story of the Red Sox being humiliated in game 3 of the AL Championship Series, then being down with no wins and three losses even their die hard fans were throwing in the towel.  After all no team in the history of the playoffs and World series had ever comeback down 3-0 to win a 7 game series.  But in Hollywood fashion they did.  That gave them the impetus to reverse thecurse and sweeo the Cardinals in the World Series. Fallon and Barrymore actually attended some of the games and were filmed there.

This film is good for men and women.  Men love it for the baseball and an undersanding of how serious fans can be about their team.  Women love it for the romance, a real chick flick.",1216425600,24,2889,4.166064981949458
2346461,4,B000A0GXRO,"There are two stories in Fever Pitch: one) the city of Boston's love/hate relationship with their Red Sox and two) a romance between a diehard Red Sox fan and a yuppie woman.

While some of the plot is a bit formulaic, the chemistry between Drew and Jimmy was fantastic. I found this a bit surprising, since to a certain degree, Jimmy Fallon was pretty much playing Jimmy Fallon. However, I think Drew Barrymore really makes a great effort in this role: you could tell she has come a long way in some of her ""romantic"" roles. Because the two characters have vastly different lives, they have to make sacrifices and accommodations in their own lives, especially when they begin to fall for each other.

You can probably forgive the fantasy ending. It is a movie after all? Romantic comedies have a way of suspending belief just like action films sometimes.

This movie is a winner in the end, though, because I think that it is a great baseball fan movie.  You will love the fantastic scenery of Fenway Park. It is also a great romantic comedy, something light without too much ""mushiness."" There is a lot of wittiness in Fallon's character that give it the light edge.

The original story involved soccer- and a hapless fan of Arsenal (a London team). That film had most of the same plot but no where near the same emotional punch and chemistry- and an ending that just sort of tailed off- almost an unfinished and certainly unpolished film.

In stark contrast we have the remake starring Drew Barrymore.  The chemistry flows far better in this film, the story is tighter and actually makes far more sense. Substituting baseball was perfect (the title actually fits better).  The basic story line was preserved but the changes from Arsenal fan to 'God's most pathetic creature- a Redsox Fan' added a lot to the film.

I couldn't tell you anything else that they've done other than this movie. What I do know is that THIS movie was very well done from script to screen! The writing is taut and believable. The dialog is humorous when it needs to be, serious when it has to be. It's just REAL. The entire movie has a sense of realism to it that most in this genre seem to lack.

I could spend a whole review just talking about the on-screen chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon. Of course, I am starting to believe Drew Barrymore could have on-screen chemistry with a mop and bucket. She's simply one of the greatest actresses of our time. She can do drama, Thrillers, and comedy. She can do Action and Romance. She can simply do anything and make it believable. But she goes beyond believable in this movie. As with so many of her recent films, she goes right to ENJOYABLE! and even that is an understatement.

2346505,3,B000A0GXRO,"At the core of this genial, by-the-numbers 2005 rom-com is a great idea - can a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan find a loving relationship with anything but his season tickets at Fenway Park? The Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter, seem like the ideal choice for the potential comic hi-jinks, but it turns out to be a much softer, more predictable film than I hoped it would be. The plot focuses on Ben, a high school geometry teacher whose lifelong obsession with the Red Sox has obscured other aspects of his life. Through a field trip with a group of his students, he meets Lindsey, a successful executive at a firm that appears to specialize in statistical information. Given that Ben is a man-child and Lindsey has exalted expectations about men that need to be cut down a few pegs, they hit it off, especially after he nurses her through a strenuous bout with food poisoning. But things start to go rather awry when spring training begins. The rest is pretty formulaic until it hits a crisis point just before the Red Sox turn it around and become play-off contenders. Real-life events intrude upon the plot as we know the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series.

Although he is convincing as a baseball fanatic, Jimmy Fallon is a bit too herky-jerky a screen persona to be entirely comfortable as a romantic lead. As Lindsey, Drew Barrymore, however, appears to be maturing into a fine comic actress. At her most idiosyncratic moments, she reminds me a bit of Jean Arthur. The rest of the cast is made up of ensembles of actors representing his and her friends and his Sox-based family in his ticket section at Fenway. Even with welcome faces like Ione Skye (where has she been since """"Say Anything""?) and Marissa Jaret Winokur of Broadway's ""Hairspray"" as two of Lindsey's friends and even JoBeth Williams as her mother, the characters remain pretty much generic filler. The predictable elements should come as no surprise since Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, the team behind Billy Crystal's generic 1990's comedies, wrote the screenplay. Regardless, there is a certain charm that persists through the whole venture. The 2005 DVD has the usual assortment of extras - insightful though sometimes random commentary by the Farrellys on an alternate track, an eight-minute making-of short produced for the FOX network, two-minute featurettes on the love story angle and the Red Sox's comeback over the Yankees, thirteen deleted scenes of varying interest, a so-so gag reel and the theatrical trailer.",1170547200,2,2496,4.886792452830188

2346512,3,B000A0GXRO,"`Fever Pitch' is loosely based on the book written by Nick Hornby, which was originally made a film in 1997 starring Colin Firth. Like his book `High Fidelity,' the filmmakers decided to move the location to America this time, and Premier League and Arsenal became Major League and Boston Red Sox, and now the newer film stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon.

But the changes do not affect the film itself very much for the two leads did a fantastic job as office worker Lindsey and school teacher Ben. Lindsey and Ben fall in love with each other, but it is not easy for Lindsey to successfully balance her work and her life with Ben, a die-hard Red Sox fan who has season tickets to Fenway Park. And this year it seems Boston Red Sox is going to break the curse.

There are lots of funny moments (without gross-out gags you have seen in Farrelly Brothers who directed this film), and Drew Barrymore is always great in romantic comedy. Jimmy Fallon is also very good as Ben, and what is remarkable about his character is that he didn't rely on caricature, creating the three-dimensional character of Ben.

To me, one disappointing thing about `Fever Pitch' is its concluding chapters, which are not only predictable (OK, I can live with that), but also are told too hurriedly. The film's dramatic ending about the story of Lindsey and Ben needs more time and subtle treatment. (It is changed because of the Red Sox's winning at the World Series.) And though I know very well that this is no longer Nick Hornby, the film could have provided some more wit or insightful observation about the sports fans.

As romantic comedy the film is a success thanks to the two leads. I enjoyed watching lovely Drew Barrymore in `Fever Pitch,' thinking at the same time: What kind of guy doesn't prefer spending time with Lindsey? But some people actually don't; as the film shows, they prefer watching their team beat the rival even though they sense that as one kid quietly says to Ben, the team may not ""love back."" But you know for sure no matter what happens, Drew's Lindsey would love back.

2346544,3,B000A0GXRO,"Fever Pitch"" shows what obsessions or deep passions can do to a relationship when both partners don't share the same thing or at least at the same level. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a devout Red Sox fan. He is a fanatic. He goes to every game, his apartment looks like a Fenway Park gift shop, and he goes to Florida every spring to watch the team play in spring training when the games don't count. Lindsey (Drew Barrymoore) is a young executive on her way up in the real world and is more or less married to her job. When the two of them eventually go out on their first date, she gets really sick, and he stays the night and takes care of her. This blows her away and she is sold. The relationship is full steam ahead, but the problem is that it's wintertime and baseball season hasn't gotten started yet. She doesn't know what she is in for.

Naturally, the Red Sox get in the way. Lindsey tries to be a good sport about it and even tries to learn the game and the two of them actually start going to games together and she becomes a fan as well. But things get out of hand when the team gets closer and closer to the playoffs and thats when problems arise.

""Fever Pitch"" is cute, sweet, and has some funny moments. Jimmy Fallon is well cast and Drew Barrymoore isn't as annoying as she normally is. But there isn't anything really special about this film.

It's actually quite enjoyable.

Drew Barrymore, as always, is phenomenal.  She's great as Lindsay, and hits the mark every time, but what else can you expect from her?

Jimmy Fallon is refreshing, he's a new face as far as romantic comedies go, so it's always nice to see someone new at the theatre.  He's great at playing an adult kid, the role fits him to a glove.

As much as I want to give this movie 5 stars, I can't.  Everythings seems perfect, the cast is great, the story is good, everything to make an enjoyable romantic comedy, but the one thing missing is the chemistry between Fallon and Barrymore.

He and Drew Barrymore have great chemistry and they really seem like they enjoy their characters.

Certainly the performances of Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are largely responsible for the winning nature of the film.  Drew is once again remarkably ""cute"" but still a good enough actress to make her character believable and likeable; Fallon uses his comic understatement to convince us he is both a rabid Bosox fan and a young man falling in love.  The movie has some nice comic bits and a sense of reality grounded in the stars' alluring comraderie.  Only an over the top ending at the World Series mars the credibility but as a movie ploy it works nicely and makes FEVER PITCH at least a three run homer.",1138406400,2,786,4.8

The script isn't all that great and Jimmy Fallon isn't very believable as a Red Sox fan.  How can he when it is a well known fact that he is a Yankees fan (talk about miscasting)?  And the final scene in Busch stadium may have looked good on paper.  But did anyone research this with Boston fans?  Did the Farrelly bros ever put out any teasers to test the Red Sox fan base to measure how lame this film and ending really was?  I saw this movie once at the theater and saw it again as a rental to see if my opinions changed over time.  Contrary to popular belief, Red Sox fans do NOT like this film.  OK, putting that aside for the rest of the general public, why would anyone else be interested in seeing this film if it didn't involve their team?  It's not a very good film and there is only so much you can do with a mediocre script.",1136764800,2,989,4.005102040816326

Ben, the almost effeminate baseball fan - typical male machismo sports fan - meets the more career oriented successful and sexy Lindsay.  And of course they would clash.

At first the movie was very cheesy, with scenes that seemed thrown together sloppily.  The editing was a little shotty and choppy, especially as we were lead into each segment with a blue backdrop to a description in Boston Red Sox lettering.  But, despite all of that, the movie pulled it off somehow in the end.

Because of how cheesy it was, a three star, but because it pulled off the feel good feeling as well as a few good scenes (Lindsay being hit with a baseball and Ben cheering and giving the guy a high five for catching the ball) I give a four star.  I wouldn't recommend running out and renting it, but if there isn't anything else to watch than this would be a good one.",1135036800,4,974,4.313186813186813
2346582,3,B000A0GXRO,"Lindsey Meeks is climbing the corporate ladder and not looking for a relationship when she meets math teacher Ben Wrightman. She initially turns him down when he asks her out, but he persists and she agrees to go out with him, only to be stricken with food poisoning the day of their first date. She is smitten when Ben takes care of her and soon they are in a serious relationship. He seems to be perfect and Lindsey's friends urge her to be cautious since it seems strange that such a great guy is still single. Ben tells Lindsey that he's a huge Red Sox fan, and his apartment is full of Red Sox memorabilia, but it is not until baseball season starts that Lindsey realizes how fanatical Ben really is. He starts blowing Lindsey off, including a trip to Paris, for his beloved Red Sox and Lindsey, after a pregnancy scare, begins to question if she can stay in a relationship with him.  Soon Ben is torn between his love for the Red Sox and his love for Lindsey. Which will he choose?

This is a cute romantic comedy, although I'm not sure if non-Red Sox fans will enjoy it as much as I did. It's not always laugh out loud funny, but there are some very funny moments. One particular scene, when Ben replays over and over again the scene of the ball going through Bill Buckner's leg, will make Red Sox fans laugh, while nodding sympathetically. Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are a cute couple, although he is more believable as a fun loving math teacher than she is as a driven career woman, mostly because it's never quite clear what she does or why she enjoys it so much. The Farrelly brothers had to change the ending of ""Fever Pitch"" when the Red Sox won the World Series and the ending feels rushed. It probably would have been a funnier ending if the Red Sox had lost.

Viewers might be surprised that this is a straight romantic comedy by the Farrelly Brothers who are known more for their gross out jokes that make you laugh despite yourself. It's not nearly as funny as ""There's Something About Mary"" but it's still fun.",1133740800,3,2034,4.418666666666667
2346583,3,B000A0GXRO,"I can identify a lot with the relationship at the center of this movie. I'm pretty into sports, especially the Redskins, and my girlfriend can barely tolerate watching a half of basketball. This flick was more successful than I expected as a romance. Barrymore is her typical cutesy self and Jimmy Fallon is the goofy boyfriend that many could fall in love with. The theme of trying to accept your significant other's wackiness will always get some laughs, and it plays out well here. Some scenes, like the season ticket draft were real funny. The scenes in Fenway with the other season ticket regulars recounting Red Sox woes worked well for me too.

I'm also a true sports fan, and I ended up disappointed by the ending. Certainly, the Red Sox victories threw the screenwriters for a loop. At times this works. The events surrounding the Red Sox come from behind over the Yankees juxtaposes well with Fallon's emergence as a man with some perspective. But the big lets get together and live happily ever after scene does not work with the baseball. I won't spoil it. But it seems more like a poor rewrite than a thought out plan.

My girlfriend dug this movie a lot. She liked how the relationship ""worked out"". I imagine that she would give this four stars. As for me, I'm a little bit too much of a sports junkie to dig some of the rewrites of baseball history. I'll give it a three.

If you're a baseball fan, you'll like the little subtleties and idiosyncracies of the national past time.  If you hate baseball, you'll like the ""romance"" angle.  There's something in this movie for everyone and it has a ""feel good"" tone to it.

I don't know if it was the writing or if Jimmy Fallon is just bad at comedy. Or it could be both. I did find some scenes to be laugh out loud funny and they're all thanks to Drew Barrymore.

2346587,3,B000A0GXRO,"I've seen almost all of the Farrelly brothers' films and I have to say that ""Fever Pitch"" falls shorter than all of them.  But don't get me wrong, ""Fever Pitch"" is sufficient as a feel good, silly romance/comedy.  It drew quite a few laughs from me while I was watching it.  I watched it alone because my wife thought it would be ""just another baseball movie.""  It isn't just another baseball movie, however, it leans more toward the romantic side of comedy.

The story revolves around Jimmy Fallon's character who is probably one of the most fanatical Boston Red Sox fans you could ever find.  He's a schoolteacher who falls for number-crunching Drew Barrymore.  They quickly fall for one another and Barrymore thinks it's cute when Fallon takes a knee and asks her to go to opening day with him.  She then quickly realizes just how fanatical Fallon is and the whole thing begins to affect their lovelife, her job, and her social life.  Eventually Fallon has to decide between Barrymore and the Red Sox.

As always, Barrymore pulls her character off with style.  I still don't get what's so special about Fallon.  To me, he's just a second-rate Adam Sandler.  In fact, this film would have probably been funnier had Sandler taken the reins as the Sox fan.  Their are plenty of cameos on and off of the field, from modern day sluggers to old-timers.

You don't have to enjoy baseball to like this film.  For that matter, you don't have to enjoy romantic comedies to enjoy this either.  It has just the right amount of both in it to keep most viewers occupied.  Also, this is based on Nick Hornby's ""Fever Pitch"" about a crazed football(soccer to us across the pond) fan.  This was adapted to film with the same title and Colin Firth as Fallon's character.  I haven't seen that version, but I'd love to since I really enjoy Firth's work.

In closing, if you enjoy comedies with either romance OR baseball as a backdrop, you should take a gander at this film.  It isn't the best comedy out there, and nowhere near the best Farrelly flick around, but it is sufficient for a lazy afternoon with you wife or girlfriend.",1131926400,4,2114,4.596256684491979
2346588,3,B000A0GXRO,"This is a decent date movie. It explores the idea of people initially seeming ""too good to be true"" and the eventual discovery that everyone has their unique hang-ups.

Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore are quite good together and make for a good comedic pairing. This is a lighthearted movie that has its funny moments. I also think it's pretty amazing that the movie had to be changed due to the Boston Red Sox actually winning the World Series.

The movie was actually being filmed through the process of the Red Sox making their historic comeback against the Yankees. It makes the movie a small part of Boston baseball history.",1131321600,4,629,4.709090909090909

And yes, Fenway Park is the stadium with the big green wall out in left field, which would be the stadium's trademark. Ben is what you call a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, that gets season tickets, left by his uncle when he passed away, and doesn't like to have to miss a game.

Flash foward to the present, where Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is now an adult, working as a school teacher. High School looks like, where he works at, and he takes the kids on a field trip, where he has to meet with Linsey (Drew Barrymore) at some sort of factory, which he returns leter on, and he asks her out on a date, but she ends up getting sick, and Ben stays around her apartment and helps out. But what she doesn't know that Ben is a Boston Red Sox fan, and he has about ever sort of memorabilia that a fan would want.

Ben is single, and Linsley's friends thinks there is some reason that he is still single, he even looks like he is about to ask her to marry him, he gets on knee, holds out a case you expect to see a ring, opens it, and asks Linsey to go to openning day with him.

2346591,4,B000A0GXRO,"I was sweetly surprised by this little film. I had relatively high expectations, being a big fan of Nick Hornby's book, but was not expecting such a thoughtful adaptation or such winning performances. Barrymore plays a grown up quite well-- a nice departure from her winning girl-next-door roles. And Fallon is a breath of fresh air as a regular, believable nice guy who's maybe a bit too obsessed with baseball. The role could have easily devolved into a bad SNL character, but Fallon pulls it off in a suitably understated way; i think that more typically cast actor  (Adam Sandler comes to mind) would have overwhelmed the role and forced the film into the direction of parody. Still funny, and we all know Adam Sandler can be as sweet as all get out, but sometimes he's just too Adam Sandler.

I admit I have a weakness for chick flicks and baseball films (which are, after all, chick flicks for men--pandering to their most romantic thoughts), but I can't stand to watch either when they're done poorly.

I kept waiting for something to happen that would either keep me in stitches or make me weep for my couple to stick it out (that's what romantic comedies do.)

I am from Boston, and of course a Red Sox fan, therefore if I were not from Boston I would have found nothing in this movie enjoyable whatsoever.

  This movie is plagued by many things. First of all it is not funny. There is not one laugh out loud, or even one quiet laugh to oneself scene, in the entire 100 minutes.  Yes it was so bad I was counting.  The movie is completely unrealistic from the dialogue to basically everything else.  How can a school teacher afford box-seat season tickets to Fenway Park, a gorgeous huge apartment in the North End, and an exorbitant amount of highly expensive professional sports gear.

  Also note to Directors it has long been practiced by EVERY NETWORK in EVERY SPORT to not show fans on TV when they have charged the field.  This has been the case now for 10 years much to my, and probably everyone else's dismay.

  I really can't trash this movie enough.  Did i mention that the dialogue stinks? Well it does.

  THis movie is one of the most annoying movies that I have ever watched. I can't believe the same poeple that made Something about Mary had anything to do with this movie.

But we all know that the Farrelly Brothers have long since...well made anything remotely close to a good, decent, or even slightly funny movie.....""Stuck together"" and now this.

 Hang it up guys. There's obviously nothing left in your collective brotherly tank.  And speaking of tank...this movie tanks big time.

  But Fenway Park is as beautiful as ever, and being reminded of the Red Sox incredible comeback against the Yanks was almost worth the suck......well not quite. It puts a bad taste in my mouth that the Red Sox had anything to do with this terrible movie. But then again I can feel lucky that at least I am not a Knick Fan and have to put up with Whoopie Goldberg's atrocious ""EDDIE"". Was there ever a worse movie then that?

Well this is close.

If you liked ""Eddie"" staring Whoopie Goldberg then you might like this. If you thought Eddie stunk then you probably want to stay away from this stinkaroo as well. If you are a Red Sox fan then just put in the 2004 season DVD for the 320th time. Because you are going to have to watch it again after this movie to get the horrible taste out of your system.

I love romantic comedies, and this one blends things in well!  The beginning is so cute starting off with their sweet romance.  The movie is delightfully funny, and it's so true that a guy can be that obsessed with sports.  Many girls can relate to this..whether it's their father or boyfriend.

2346608,3,B000A0GXRO,"Have you ever known someone who was obsessed with sports, so much so that it started to interfere with his personal life? If you have, then you can probably relate to this movie, ""Fever Pitch"", a film about a guy who falls for a woman and seems to have his personal life on track only to find his fanaticism with baseball getting in the way of his relationship.

This movie is centered in Boston and the lead character, played by Jimmy Fallon, is hooked on the Red Sox. He has season tickets and never misses a game, not for anything. But now, he has met a woman he likes and he has to make choices. Exactly how important is baseball to him? Is it so important that he would choose it over the desires of the woman in his life? The decision isn't as easy as it sounds, for Fallon's love affair with the Red Sox is very deep and very real.

There are some things I really like about this film. First of all, I like the fact that Drew Barrymore, Fallon's love interest, doesn't get all negative toward him and his interest in the Red Sox. She wants him to enjoy the things he likes best. But she does get a little impatient after a while- and understandably so- when she realizes just how crazy Fallon is for his beloved baseball team. He does end up choosing baseball over her on more than one occasion and it almost ruins the relationship. This film does a decent job in helping to answer some important questions about how much is too much when it comes to extracurricular activities.

On the negative side, however, this movie is very flat. There is some humor but there is little suspense and nothing that is going to stick out in most viewers' memories as anything incredible. This story is quite simple, actually, and its lack of sophistication makes it less enjoyable than it could have been. It seems like a movie directed at teenagers and Boston Red Sox fans more than any other groups.

Performances are pretty good in this movie. This, added with the basic easy to follow plot, the likable characters, and the positive outcome of this film is enough to convince me to recommend it to potential viewers.

I agree the ending is weak with him signing away his tickets...except for that...it was an entertaining movie. Not rocket science...not preachy...just a cute ""Romantic Comedy."" Not a 2004 Post Season documentary!

2346611,4,B000A0GXRO,"I rented this movie and I liked it even though I barely laughed but just merely smiled at its cuteyness. It wasn't until I looked on the back of the case when I noticed the ""directed by the Farrelly Brothers"" tag, notable for directing Dumb and Dumber, Me Myself and Irene and this movie about siamese twins(never saw it). It's a change of pace for sure but the film is slightly better than it's parts.

Ben is a teacher who's also an insane Boston Red Sox fan. He buys season tickets and sees every guy, even sets up with his friends who's going to which game. So naturally he's single. While on a little field trip, he meets Lindsey, a button-cute businesswomen and being subtletly bullied by his class, he asks her out but she says no. Afterwards she reconsiders since he's so radically different(that's one thing that women should do more actually: quit dating the handsome as hell but inconsiderate types and pick us nerd types who are very sensitive).

They end up dating, only Lindsey finds herself playing second fiddle to the Red Sox. So the rest of the film is them pretty much struggling with her trying to be supportive while he's trying to be a good boyfriend but without letting go of his passion.

The charm of the film really comes from the chemistry between Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore. They seem like the kind of couple where they compliment each other, if only Jimmy were a bit more interesting. I guess it's the SNL curse that Mike Myers somehow escaped that everyone who left SNL to pursue movie roles, well kinda suck. Granted there's not much for him to play with but still.

If there's one thing that's slightly disappointing is the ending. Since it's a romantic comedy it does follow a formula so of course he ends up with her but since the Red Sox actually won the World Series, they changed the ending to incorporate it but it seems so much of an afterthought, it's literally ""oh yeah by the way, they won"". They should've showed them both reacting to the news they won.

If you're looking for a good date movie, can't exactly go wrong with this. It's like popcorn: you'll enjoy it but you'll still get hungry afterwards.",1128729600,3,2152,4.550387596899225

2346613,4,B000A0GXRO,"""Fever Pitch"" is based on Nick Hornby's autobiographical novel of the same name, which chronicled the life of a fanatical British soccer fan. A more faithful film adaptation of the novel was made in 1997 in the UK. This latest version moves the action to Boston, USA, and changes the sport to baseball. Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Fallon) has been an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan since his Uncle Carl took him to a game at Fenway Park when he was 7 years old. Twenty-three years later, his enthusiasm for the Red Sox is undiminished. When he takes some of his geometry students to visit a professional who has applied mathematics to her career, Ben meets Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore). Lindsay is an ambitious, successful corporate number-cruncher, in contrast to Ben's laid back, boyish school teacher, but the two awkwardly hit it off. Ben seems like the perfect man for Lindsay, but her friends wonder why such a nice guy is still single at age 30. With baseball season on the horizon, Lindsay is about to find out.

Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly are huge Red Sox fans themselves, so were a perfect fit for ""Fever Pitch"". Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon both give appealing performances, making their characters' obsessions quirky, innocuous, and funny. Ben Wrightman captures Fallon's cute, disheveled, comedic charm. Barrymore has never looked better. So the biggest battle in a romantic comedy -appealing stars- is no battle here. Lindsay's trio of girlfriends deserves some mention. Ione Skye, Marissa Jaret Winokur, and KaDee Strickland are insightful and amusing as Lindsay's friends who are the first to wonder why Ben is still single. The women's conversations make good-natured fun of their competitiveness and suspicions, but strike me as very true to life. They probably add more to the film than their counterparts in Ben's trio of friends. I think ""Fever Pitch"" is a little too long for a romantic comedy. Some nonessential material could have been cut. But this is a fun film that revolves around the question of how much people should change for a relationship and how much they should expect the other person to change.  And it's likely to ring funny and true with sports fans and their mates.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include 13 deleted scenes, a gag reel (6 min.), a theatrical trailer (2  min.), 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In the ""Love Triangle Internet Feature"" (2 min.), Drew Barrymore talks about her character. ""Break the Curse Internet Feature"" (2  min.) is about the Red Sox winning streak in 2004, which coincided with the filming of the movie and how they were able to film at the World Series when the Red Sox won. ""Making a Scene Fever Pitch"" (8 minutes) features interviews with the Farrelly Brothers and their producers about the necessity of getting to St. Louis and filming at the World Series because it would cost so much to reproduce the scene if the Red Sox won. They tell the story of moving shooting from Toronto to St. Louis on the spur of the moment and borrowing one of Fox Sports' cameras to film in the stands. The audio commentary by Peter and Bobby Farrelly talks a little bit about the novel, locations, and filming, but focuses mostly on the cast and performances, including bit parts. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.",1128124800,3,3377,4.866086956521739
2346627,1,B000A0GXRO,"Bad direction, strike one. Bad acting, strike two. Bad writing, strike three. One of the worst movies I've seen. I only chuckled once. Jimmy Fallon was sort of descent but Drew Barrymore apparently decided to ""wing it"" and ignore her acting and concentrate on producing, which also was bad. The sound mix was also terrible. There was low or no backround foley and they always sounded inside a vaccum. I cannot see how people enjoyed this movie. Avoid it like the plague!",1127779200,4,470,4.7439024390243905
2346628,4,B000A0GXRO,"This is a fun little ""total package"" film that appeals to both genders: it has a nice little love story along with Drew Barrymore taking on her first real grown-up role for the women, plus sports and the Farrelly Brothers' slapstick humor for the men compliments of the inside look at the demented little extended family started by ""Nuff Ced"" McGreevey and the Royal Rooters we lovingly call ""Red Sox Nation.""  This Americanization of the Nick Hornby novel brings you up to speed on the final quarter-century of the Curse Of The Bambino with astonishing accuracy, such as the CGIing of the Green Monster to what it looked like back in 1980 (a deleted scene even showed the old troughs in the Fenway men's room), the old Reverse Curve sign on Storrow Drive that was defaced to read ""Reverse The Curse"" and has since been cut down by Mitt Romney, and cameos by local hardcore fans such as Jessamy Finet and Stephen King.  I managed to catch the sneak preview of it the week before it opened, and happened to get the right crowd of fellow fans who wanted to relive Game 4; there were straight-out laughs at stuff like Ben's Yankee toilet paper, Troy's comment about Ted Williams rolling over in his freezer, Ben's use of a video of Buckner like it was a drug, and a round of applause when Foulke makes that famous underhanded toss.  The guy sitting next to me said to his girlfriend that he could see himself in the footage of the crowd at the rolling rally at the end.  The Curse Reversed Edition really isn't worth the extra cash, as it just extends the ending with additional playoff footage such as Manny and Millar doing some really interesting high-fives in the dugout.",1127692800,,1672,4.581939799331104
2346629,2,B000A0GXRO,"The funny sports fanatic is the cynic who loves his team so much he can insult it profanely and relentlessly - the lovable, intelligent fan, winner or loser. He is generally not a complete idiot, he does not generally own 9,000 pieces of memorabilia or cover his ears at a restaurant so he won't know who won last night's baseball game. That's the annoying sports fanatic.

""Fever Pitch"" gives us the second fan, Ben (Jimmy Fallon), junior high math teacher goofball follower of the Boston Red Sox. He's thirty going on fourteen, thoughtful enough, a little off in his priorities, and generally not a funny guy. Girls may very well find him funny, and the portrayal of his fanaticism accurate. But, then, they're girls. This is probably what they think most guys are like with sports. The female equivalent to Ben would be a shopaholic riding around *inside* the cart at Shopko.

Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the movie is really more about Lindsey (producer Drew Barrymore) a thirtysomething engineer who meets Ben when he brings some students to her firm. On a dare Ben asks Lindsey out and plays nice through their winter courtship, helping Lindsey keep her jackal pack of gossipy, doubting friends at bay.

Then baseball season begins, and Ben turns down a trip to Lindsey's parents to go scout his team at spring training. Later he rejects a weekend in Paris to see a Sox game. The inevitable conflicts ensue. Ben has the team. Lindsey has her job. Cue up the typical peaks, valleys and misunderstandings of a romantic comedy. Fallon and Barrymore has fair chemistry, although Barrymore is cuter than Fallon is anything. Ben is a bore, a sheepish, unimpressive geek with an immature wardrobe and childlike view of life. Lindsey's pretty forgiving, really, and the movie fudges a bit by having Ben break her heart in a key scene instead of simply allowing Lindsey to level him with a hard gaze and tell him to grow up.

It'd be more forgivable if ""Fever Pitch"" seemed to know much about the Red Sox, or baseball. The script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel doesn't go there. Yes, Ben recounts the Sox' unfortunate history after trading Babe Ruth in 1919. But he doesn't express any love for the sport - other than saying it's simple, which is not the same as saying it's sublime - never declares a favorite player, never jeers an opposing team. And Fallon, as the hired hand - it's Barrymore's production remember - does what he's told. It's a guy's flick cut off at the stirrups.",1127520000,4,2493,4.724137931034483
2346630,2,B000A0GXRO,"I'm a Red Sox fan and a sucker for romantic comedies, so I waited for the ""Special Red Sox Collectors Edition"" before even seeing the flick for the first time -- I knew I wanted to buy it. This review contrasts the two editions, with some minor comments about the movie at the end.

Now I see I paid an extra $4 for the ""Collector's Edition"" over the regular DVD release for what amounts to about a minute of extra Red Sox highlights interpolated at the end. That's it. That's the only difference. That, my friends, is a rip-off from the marketing people, and a pretty crummy one.

Not to say that as a DVD this isn't a very nice package. The gag reel is pretty funny. The directors' commentary and a couple of the featurettes are interesting enough. And the deleted scenes, frankly, make it into a better movie; I only wish they'd done a Director's cut and re-inserted the deleted scenes, because it makes the occasionally thin plot a lot fleshier. In particular, the deleted scene of Uncle Carl taking young Ben to his first game at Fenway is actually pretty wonderful, and great back story for why Ben is so addicted as an adult. It's a major weakness of Farrelly Brothers movies that they seem to cut for time what are often the best parts of the movies, resorting to the truly wretched device of voice-over narration to substitute for what would've been better done as actual story. ""Me Myself and Irene"" serves as the ultimate monument to this awful problem of trying to use voice-over narration to solve story problems, where script and editing problems could've been overcome with some attention before production was ever started. ""Fever Pitch"", fortunately, manages to stand up well enough even with the narration. It's just that it's more obvoiusly in watching the deleted scenes that this could've been raised from an enjoyable but somewhat fluffy movie to one with more of an edge -- both sweet and sour -- had they put them in the ""original"" movie.

And, as I note, I did enjoy the movie -- the romantic comedy is relatively adult, and despite some glossing over of Ben and Lindsey's respective addictions to the Red Sox and the workplace, one does get a sense of adult motivations and a real relationship between the two. Jimmy Fallon, quite suprisingly, does an excellent job at walking a fine line here between not trying to be a film dreamboat (which he couldn't pull off) and avoiding being a complete moron in the loveable-moron school (which would've been unbelievable, given the Drew Barrymore character's sophistication.) In particular, he does a nice shift of gears from the sweet ""winter Ben"" to some over the top moments in the height of his Red Sox passion.

One quibble, another thing that could've been fixed with the deleted scenes restored: you never quite get that verisimilitude of exactly what kind of dumb things us Red Sox fans get cranked up by -- arguing on the phone with, say, talk radio about managerial moves at 11 PM while your girlfriend lies naked and beckoning in bed, for instance. Still, good job on getting the essential passions on the table.

But all that said, why on earth did I get charged an extra $4 for a few baseball highlights that do nothing to make the movie better? No good reason. If you like the movie or the idea of the movie, just buy the regular non-collectors' DVD edition. Even if you're a Red Sox diehard like me, no reason to shell out the extra money for the collectors' edition, because there's nothing to collect you won't also be able to get in the deluxe 2004 playoff DVD set of the games.",1127520000,111,3565,4.625592417061611
2346631,5,B000A0GXRO,"This movie was fun!

 One of the reviewers stated : ""The Red Sox theme got blown out of all proportions"" but I couldn't agree less.  Through the entire movie my family kept pointing at Jimmy Fallon saying, ""oh my God! That's you!""

After a life-time of having my heart and emotions shoved through a shredder by the Red Sox, a little romance set against the impossible dream of MY Team winning, actually winning, a World Series is great fun. And none of us misses the irony that this movie was supposed to showcase true love against inevitable despair; that irony makes the laughter all the sweeter.

This is a fun little movie; and as a friend of mine once said, ""not every movie has to be a FILM.""  Fever Pitch may not be ""high cinema,"" but it is a lot of fun; and again, after a lifetime of ""high cinema"" and rousing despair from the Boston Red Sox, a fun little movie on the tails of a World Series Championship is just the ticket.",1127433600,12,934,4.339080459770115

Jimmy Fallon is perfect as the Sox-obsessed fan trying to change his life for a woman. I was really surprised by his acting, especially during a scene where he tells Lindsey his true feelings.

Dotted with real-life Boston footage and games, this movie is not only a fun storyline, but it's great to watch history being made. The Farley brothers obviously love Boston and the Sox and certainly hit the jack-pot in their series win last year.

Cute and fun, with many laughs (I really liked the supporting cast) this is a great movie for a light-night.",1127433600,2,718,4.6015625

I highly recommend this movie.",1127260800,5,355,4.5625

2346635,4,B000A0GXRO,"I bought this movie before even seeing it, and it was well worth it! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon have wonderful chemistry. And for those of you who aren't big Fallon fans, you'll be surprised... I was shocked to learn that this is a Farrelly brother's movie, the same guys who brought us crazy flicks like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. I guess their getting tame in their old age, but that's nothing to scoff at because this is an altogether great movie. Great date movie, great romantic comedy, great comedy, great everything.

Barrymore is Lindsay, a hardworking executive-type who scarcely has a minute when she isn't on the phone. Ben is a laidback geometry teacher, the teacher that all the kids like because he knows how to have fun. Ben meets Lindsay while he's taking a few of his students on a field trip to the same company that Lindsay works for. After a bit of teasing from his students that he could never get a girl who is that classy, he takes a leap and asks her out. She says no. A few days later, Lindsay's friends are bugging her because she expects to much from a relationship, and even Lindsay begins to realize that she's only been dating ""poodles."" On the first date, he goes to pick her up and, surprise, she has food poisoning. He never leaves her side. Their relationship grows, but an unexpected turn comes in mid-March. It's the beginning of the Red Sox season, and she has NO idea just how big a fan he truly is. So the question is... can she survive having a relationship with ""summer guy"" when she already knows that she loves ""fall guy""?

Very, very funny and very sweet. The whole disastrous first date scene really had me laughing, especially when you can hear the nasty sound of her puking coming from the bathroom followed by her yelling at her dog to ""don't eat that!"" I suppose a bit of that familiar Farrelly brothers comedy does peak out throughout this movie. What amazed me was Fallon's performance. Seriously. Didn't know he had it in him, especially after Taxi. There's nothing not to like about this. Yes, it does follow the boy-meets-girl formula, but this movie is FRESH! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1127001600,6,2163,4.615584415584416
2346636,3,B000A0GXRO,"Havent' we already seen this type of movie already?  Yes, it was called Anger Management.  The only difference is that in Fever Pitch, happiness ended at Fenway Park and in Anger Management, happiness ended at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.

As a Yankee fan, I'll take Anger Management anyday.  I'll never watch the ending of this movie, EVER AGAIN!!!",1126828800,2,349,4.864406779661017
2346647,4,B000A0GXRO,"Fever Pitch is the sweetest and most laidback movie by the Farrelly brother's. It does have it's whacky side though of course though. Drew Barrymore has trouble finding the right guy. When she finds him her friends like him but doubt he's 100% perfect. He tells her on his own that he's a huge Red Sox fan which is why he has had relationship problems. She has no problem with that though because she doesn't know how huge of a fan he actually is. Jimmy Fallon (Taxi, Saturday Night Live) shows here that he actually has some talent as the Red Fox fan/b/f. His obsession with the Red Sox is so huge that he rather go to a game than to Paris with Barrymore. Sooner or later though he realizes he has to choose love or the game he loves.

  Barrymore and Fallon have strong Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan type chemestry here. Such good chemestry that I wouldn't be surprised if he became Barrymore's 3rd or 4th husband lol. Plus the script is smart and realistic. I mean I'm sure real couples even have arguements like this. I'm sure most guys get mad at their wives or g/f's when they missed a good game to spend time with them instead. I'm sure the g/f gets extremely hurt by that as well. This is a well made movie of what it's like to be a big fan while struggling to have a relationship at the same time. It's funny too how Fallon went from making one of the worse movies from a Saturday Night Live actor to one of the best.",1126828800,,1423,4.243542435424354
2346648,5,B000A0GXRO,"The only reason I wanted to see this movie is that as a life long Red Sox fan, I was looking forward to seeing the ending. Based on the previews I did not know if I would like or appreciate the love story of Lindsey and Ben.

I was quite surprised how much I loved this movie! The love story was the sweetest thing I have ever seen! Lindsey and Ben's first ""date"" when he arrives at her door to find she has food poisoning and he takes care of her while she is getting sick all over the place, was funny and cute. What woman wouldn't like a guy like that?

Of course I identified with Ben's strong love for the BoSox, and laughed at Ben and Lindsey's fight over it. It reminded me so much of ""discussions"" my husband and I have had. He taking Lindsey's position of it being ""only a game"" when I would get upset over Red Sox losses and my taking Ben's position of it being one of the most important things to me ever and being upset with hubby for not getting it.

Lindsey's mad dash across Fenway Park with security chasing her near the end of the movie is one of the funniest things I have ever seen! The only quibble I have with this version is that the ending seemed rushed. It just went boom, boom, boom, Red Sox overcome the Yankees, and then win over the Cardinals.  It seemed to only take a few seconds.

I would have preferred that more time would have been taken showing game 4 of the WS and the celebration of the win. I understand that the Red Sox collector's version of this movie has an extended ending so am purchasing that one as well.

2346653,4,B000A0GXRO,"When the Boston Red Sox lost game three of the American League Championship to the New York Yankees last October and it was duly noted by everybody covering the games that no team had ever come back from that sort of deficit to win a series in the history of baseball, it suddenly hit me that doing that was exactly how the Red Sox would ""Reverse the Curse.""  I had the same sort of metaphysical certainty for what was going to happen that I did in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series when Randy Johnson came in to pitch for Arizona, which meant that if the Diamondbacks came back in the bottom of the 9th, Johnson would be the first pitcher to win three World Series games in a long, long time.  Being a Yankees fan these were both bitter realizations, and my big regret is that I did not bet $100 for the Red Sox to win the World Series in four games the night this all hit me because I would still have been miserable, but I also would have been very rich.

I did not watch the final two games of the AL Championship or the World Series (I knew what was going to happen, so what was the point?), which means I decided to watch ""Fever Pitch"" with some trepidation because I can live without salt being rubbed in the wounds.  But this 2005 comedy from the Farrelly Brother can be seen and enjoyed by fans of the Evil Empire as well as the Fenway Faithful, because what is important here is that Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a baseball fan (which, you will call is short for ""fanatic"").  Because he is a Red Sox fan he is a long-suffering baseball fan.  He could be a Cub fan, but before 2004 the Chicago northsiders were still a distant second to the Red Sox when it came to the curse of Sisyphus department since Boston had lost a trio of World Series game sevens just in my lifetime, without bringing the ""freakin'"" tag team of Bucky Dent and Aaron Boone into the picture.  Besides, Ben has turned a wall of his living room into a replica of the Green Monster, which is way cool (bricks and vines like Wrigley Field would not be as cool and unless you try and do Monument Park what are you going to try and duplicate in your home to look like Yankee Stadium?).

Ben is a math teacher in a grade school.  He meets Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) on a class field trip to her office and decides to ask her out.  It takes some effort to get to not having a first date, during which it is true that he looks, but he also does cleanup duty better left to the elves.  Lindsey is suitable impressed, but what she does not understand is that this is Winter Ben.  His season tickets to the Red Sox have not yet arrived, Fenway Park is covered in snow, and he has the time to focus attention on Lindsey.  The problem is going to be when Summer Ben blooms and Lindsey gets her first indication when she sees Spring Training Ben, who is like a maniac from another planet.  No wonder this guy is twenty-ten and unmarried.  But then so is Lindsey, so she has some issues too, just not as many as this guy.  Ben has dug himself in a massive hole with Lindsey, but then so have the Red Sox and you know how their season ended.

Fallon is well suited to this role overall, although there are a few moments where he needs to act less and relax more.  His character is functionally insane so the point does not need to be overplayed to work.  But the problem here is more the script, which does not really think of Ben as being a real boy and allows mean-spirited jokes in the name of humor and at the expense of the character.  Barrymore is once again on perfect pitch and solidifies her position as the current queen of romantic comedy (see also, ""50 First Dates"").  She is smart, she is cute, and when she gets that hurt look in here eyes and that her voice sounds just so sad you want to take a baseball bat to the jerk who caused her that pain.  His Greek chorus consisting of his ""summer family"" at Fenway Park comes out ahead of her gal pal group, mainly because they have the grand litany of black days in Red Sox history as the text for their riffs.

Yes, the ending of the film is a blatant example of having your cake and eating it too.  But do you really want a date movie where the women come out crying because of what Ben was willing to do to keep Lindsay and the men are cursing because of what Ben was willing to do to keep Lindsay?  Be sure to check out the bonus features that talk about how Barrymore and Fallon had to scramble to get to the final game of the World Series to take advantage of how baseball reality was once again taking a backseat to Hollywood fantasy.",1126656000,2,4555,4.1901489117983965

Drew Barrymore plays Lindsey Meeks, a dedicated and perpetuatlly-single businesswoman.  One day, she meets an average-guy schoolteacher, Ben (Jimmy Fallon).  Convinced by her friends that a normal guy with a normal life and a normal job might be just what she needs, Lindsey decides to give Ben a chance.  What follows is a whirlwind fairy-tale romance that seems too good to be true.  Then, one day, as the snow starts to thaw on the Boston Common, Ben makes a confession: he's a Red Sox fan.  If you've ever lived in Boston, you'll understand what this means.  Soon, Lindsey starts to realize that the Red Sox are more than just a baseball team.  They're her biggest competition.

Fever Pitch is a must-own for any die-hard Sox fan.  But is it good enough for the non-Sox-fan viewer?  Perhaps not if you're a Yankees fan.  But Fever Pitch (loosely based on a Nick Hornby novel about what we in the States call soccer) is a cute chick flick for the rest of you.  The story may not be flawless or without its chick-flick sap, but Fallon is perfect for the role-and he and Barrymore work especially well together.  I wasn't the only one in the theater laughing to the point of tears-and, considering I now live in a place where people are usually either Reds fans or Indians fans, I think I can safely assume that you don't have to own a special edition World Series Johnny Damon T-shirt to enjoy Fever Pitch.  Those who don't get the Red Sox thing will think Ben and his friends are hilarious-and those who do get it will think it's funny `cuz it's true.",1126569600,3,1820,4.453172205438066

Overall the movie was stupid and foretable.",1126310400,3,371,4.470588235294118
2346661,5,B000A0GXRO,"Selfless love exists in many forms.  ""Fever Pitch"" artfully weaves two of them.

One of Ben Wrightman's (Jimmy Fallon) 9th grade muses asks him, ""When have the RedSox ever loved you back?""  But for all of us who have loved and lost and loved some more, the answer isn't so clear.

Especially during these past few years (thank you John Henry, Larry Lucchino, and Theo Epstein), that love has been requited.  But the years of Jimmy Williams and Dan Duquette weren't so bad after all either.  And we'll always have Ted Williams (and Harry Hooper, and even Babe Ruth for a few years . . .)

Drew Barrymore plays her second romantic movie ending on a baseball field (Never Been Kissed) extremely well.  She's a vulnerable cutie with lots of female power and a straight shooter.  In my opinion, she shares her secret shame of ""seeing patterns of numbers and rearranging them into new patterns"" quite well.  Her buddies are convincing women characters that test and question her.

Jimmy Fallon plays a wonderful sweet school teacher, err man, with ""something not quite right"".  His buddies exist on the RedSox plane only -- maybe because there's nothing else.  Some of his little bits are perfect moving the movie forward by adding dimension to his personality.

For me, ""Fever Pitch"" works on practically all levels.  I have seen it thrice and cried every time.  My wife (from Boston) liked it as well.

For my NY Yankee friends, probably not.

Go Sox!",1125964800,57,1447,4.742971887550201
2346662,4,B000A0GXRO,"Are the Farrelly Brothers growing up?  In the past they have made a string of utterly insane comedies that sometimes barely bordered on the edge of good taste (well, sometimes they did indeed cross over the edge), but here they have a movie that is tasteful from beginning to end.  That is not to say that it is bad for all that.  I found the first ten or fifteen minutes to be a bit on the slow side, and the vomit scenes unpleasant (I'm sorry, any guy who hung around an apartment while someone was being sick would not be taken a adorable and the act not as romantic, but all in all more than a little weird, especially the staying on the couch overnight part), but after it got underway, I enjoyed this quite a bit.

This is actually a pretty accurate picture of what relationships are like:  flawed and filled with compromise.  The movies all-too-often portray romance as if it were all a question of waiting for the perfect person, while in fact it is a question of waiting for an imperfect person.  The issue in FEVER PITCH is whether one can have a relationship with someone who is overall pretty decent, but has an overwhelming obsession in their life.  In this case, can Lindsey manage a relationship with Ben, who is a really nice guy except for his utter obsession with the Boston Red Sox, an obsession that might top his love for her?  I really liked this whole idea of imperfect people forcing themselves to make compromises to find--as the self-help book tells us--someone to love instead of someone perfect.

The movie was pretty funny throughout, not one of the funniest you'll see, but enough to be consistently entertaining.  I have always liked Drew Barrymore and loved seeing her in this as in her previous films (though I didn't like the red hair).  I have always hated Jimmy Fallon (sorry, but its true) and while I'm not anxious to search out his next movie, I didn't dislike him in this like I expected to.  I do think the movie would have been strengthened by a stronger actor in his role, but he didn't kill the film by any stretch of the imagination.  I really enjoyed all the location shots in the film, not just in Fenway (my second favorite MLB ballpark after my beloved Wrigley Field, only two blocks from my apartment) but in Boston as a whole.

All in all, this was a pretty decent romantic comedy.  It also goes down as probably the best romantic baseball movie ever made.  OK, there isn't a lot of competition in that category, but there you go.  In closing, I would like add that I actually prefer this to the British film starring Colin Firth that was also based on the Nick Hornby novel FEVER PITCH.  Like HIGH FIDELITY, Hornby's novel translates exceptionally well from a British to an American context.",1125619200,,2743,4.52738336713996
2346663,5,B000A0GXRO,"I love Jimmy Fallon and I admit I was a bit skeptical about seeing this because he really disappointed in Taxi.  However, he found himself again and did a complete 180 degree turnaround.  This movie was funny and endearing and to my surprise, somewhat realistic (as far as fantatical fans).  Jimmy plays Ben who is obsessed with the Red Sox and the story follows him and Lindsey as they start a relationship and she begins to see the extent of his passion for sports and especially baseball.  I think this movie really worked well because these two had amazing chemistry.

Even if you aren't a big fan of baseball (how could you not be) or any sport, you'll still enjoy this heartwarming comedy.",1125446400,,695,4.617886178861789
2346664,4,B000A0GXRO,"Now I'm biased.  I am also one of the most pathetic creatures on Earth--a Red Sox fan.  Given which, this is a FUN movie!  Now, cinematically, it's NOT really a four-star movie.  But I think if you like baseball and you're looking for a romantic comedy and you're not an Evil Empire fan, you'll enjoy ""Fever Pitch"".  It's funny and sweet--and, oh yeah.  The Divine intervention.

The Urban Myth goes, they wanted to pick a losing team--that's why they choose the Red Sox.  But, by the grace of G-d, the F. Bros. shot this movie in 2004.  They originally wrapped up filming in August, 2004.  They had to come back, reshoot, and BE there in St. Louis.  YES!

I also know some Sox didn't want to see it because JF is an NYY fan.  Oh, please!  Just think how Galling it must have been for him!  Obviously, he will sell himself for money!

My wife and I went to see it together and even though I am an American and she is British and she has a limited baseball knowledge (although she has been to several major league games) she found plenty to enjoy and laugh about. It works very well on several levels. There are some great views of the Boston Red Sox's Fenway Park, including actual baseball game footage, great location filming of Boston itself, plenty of baseball talk, including some for the more nostalgic fans. Also, there is plenty to satisfy those wanting a romantic love story. It is a very amiable and good-natured film. It starts you out on an upbeat tempo and sustains it until the end. It leaves you feeling good. And it does it all without being overly sentimental or silly. Drew Barrymore (she reminds me more and more of Marilyn Monroe the older she gets) is lovely and sweet as Lindsey Meeks and Jimmy Fallon is also great and entirely believeable as Ben Wrightman. This film has something good to offer to everyone. It is a very positive and entertaining and even realistic comedy. If you love baseball you won't be disappointed. This film delivers. If you are a romantic at all you will enjoy this nice, light-hearted movie.",1124755200,2,1238,4.657534246575342
