2877629,5,B000RZS5VE,"I love watching these HRDs, these guys playing for $2500. Now days players wouldnt even do stuff like this. They do it at the all star game all hopped up on roids.",1345766400,,163,4.125
2877630,5,B000RZS5VE,"This is really a review of all three volumes of Home Run Derby. This is just enjoyable nostalgia, a look back to when baseball players wore flannel and were middle class, not the spoiled multi-millionaire pains they are today. Many of the ballplayer participants are gone now and this is a delightful look at who they were, plus a pleasant contest between two ballplayers ... puts a personality along with that baseball card that we have of these guys. Don't expect a technologically and theatrically polished program, here, but just a 1960-ish fun program. Baseball fans of the good old days will not be disappointed.",1261267200,,618,4.895238095238096
2877631,5,B000RZS5VE,"Great nostalgia in all 3 volumes of Home Run Derby.  Here's who appeared on each DVD, ranked by how many homers they hit.  To limit the ""spoiler"" effect I won't list the number of home runs hit by each player.

Vol. 1  (94 home runs in 8 contests)  Mickey Mantle, Harmon Killebrew, Hank Aaron, Ken Boyer, Willie Mays, Rocky Colavito, Jim Lemon, Earnie Banks, Jackie Jensen.

Vol. 2  (84 home runs in 9 contests)  Dick Stuart, Hank Aaron, Wally Post, Frank Robinson, Bob Cerv, Eddie Mathews, Bob Allison, Gus Triandos, Duke Snider, Al Kaline.

Vol. 3  (123 home runs in 9 contests)  Willie Mays, Jackie Jensen, Ernie Banks, Mickey Mantle, Gil Hodges, Bob Allison, Harmon Killebrew, Jim Lemon, Bob Cerv, Rocky Colavito.",1238198400,8,717,4.795081967213115
2877632,5,B000RZS5VE,"Talk about a stroll down memory lane, the episodes are from a TV show that was taped at Wrigley Field (a minor-league ballpark) in Los Angeles, California, and featured the home-spun commentary of Mark Scott and the distinct calls from umpire Art Passarella.

Originally aired in 1959, the program has had nine-lives for the nine-inning contests, with it being shown in syndication, on Fox Sports Net, and on ESPN Classic, the last time being in 2005 on the latter.

With such sluggers as Harmon Killebrew, Mickey Mantle, Al Kaline, Willie Mays, Henry Aaaon and Duke Snider, it was truly a showcase of stars in a timeless game of seeing who can lay the heaviest lumber on the baseball.

The DVD is the second of three volumes, which is the complete season of shows. This is a classic round-tripper that will keep the hot-stove league burning throughout the year.",1212451200,,862,4.8108108108108105
2877633,5,B000RZS5VE,"Volume 2 of ""Home Run Derby"" was released on DVD on August 14, 2007, and it's an even better bargain than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-1/dp/B000PMFRRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volume 1</a>, because the second volume has 9 total episodes (vs. eight on the first DVD).

This second ""Home Run Derby"" Digital Disc takes us back to 1959-1960, where we get to watch such big-league icons as Henry Aaron, Duke Snider, Eddie Mathews, Frank Robinson, and Al Kaline swinging for the Wrigley Field fences. (Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, California, that is.)

This ""Volume 2"" DVD also features an amazing battle between two sluggers that aren't nearly as well-known -- Wally Post and Dick Stuart. The Post vs. Stuart ""Derby"", in fact, is absolutely incredible (I won't put in any spoilers here, however). But it's a contest that features some things that seem more akin to a ""Mantle vs. Mays"" match-up. Great stuff.

The black-and-white video quality is pretty good for ""Derby"" Volume Two, with the picture being displayed in its original Full-Frame format (1.33:1). Audio comes to us via very serviceable Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono DVD soundtracks. A ""Play All"" feature is on the disc too.

The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/third-and-final-DVD-installment/dp/B000RPCK0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">third and final DVD installment</a>&nbsp;in this series of home-run-hitting contests was made available to the public on September 25, 2007, and it's a good disc too, with the last 9 ""Derby"" programs being presented, with Willie Mays' ample fence-bashing talents taking center stage in several of those ""Volume 3"" shows.

2877635,5,B000RZS5VE,"this is a must for baseball fans of past years...to see aaron, mantle, snider, mays, in their old uniforms and in the prime of their playing years is worth the cost.  to make note of the different style of batting follow through will make you think.  it's also funny to hear someone try to make a tv cast with a empty park sound like this is important game, even through it is hard not to laugh at the interviews with these baseball greats because you can see they really don't give 2 cents about what is going on  !!1",1190332800,4,518,4.212121212121212
