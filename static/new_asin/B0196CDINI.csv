7564677,4,B0196CDINI,"This is very compelling story about the aftermath of European colonialism, post-slavery African life and the risks of loving across the color line in the 1950s-1960s in West Africa. I found the story very moving.",1472428800,2,212,5.085714285714285

7564682,5,B0196CDINI,I didn't realize when I put this movie on that it wasn't in English. I almost turned it off but since most people gave it a 4 star rating I decided to watch it. Reading the dialogue took some getting use to and I quickly realized that you can't take your eyes off the screen for even a second or you'll miss one or more lines and then be lost. Once I got into the momentum of reading the storyline I really enjoyed the movie. It was well made and such a beautiful love story. I highly recommend it.,1463270400,7,498,4.040404040404041
7564683,4,B0196CDINI,"Very long. Beautiful scenery. Making several attempts to finish this and not really connected with anything about it.  However, I came back to change my rating from three to four stars.  Upon finishing, I found that I had enjoyed the plot.  However, it's still too long for my liking.",1463184000,4,284,4.755102040816326

8744161,2,B0196CDINI,"I watched this on Prime Video so I may not show up as a ""verified purchase"".

I'm so glad I read the book first or I would never have known what was going on in this film.  The book is a bit disjointed and hard to follow sometimes but the movie, in it's attempt to condense for time, pretty much misses the story altogether.  Not recommended.  If you want to know this story, read the book.",1532217600,,390,4.092105263157895

8744165,5,B0196CDINI,"I'm not one for these types of movies, but this one should be seen!  Incredible movie... hard not to want to see it over and over again.

8744167,5,B0196CDINI,"I absolutely love this movie and wanted to own the DVD. To do that, I also bought a multi-region DVD player (also from Amazon). So glad to finally own a copy of ""Palmeras En La Nieve""! I will eventually buy a copy in Blu-Ray too. Thank you Amazon!",1481760000,2,247,4.166666666666667
8744168,5,B0196CDINI,"A beautiful love story for the romantic. Nudity, violence and vivid sex scenes for the voyeur. This movie captures your attention from the first moment and keeps you captive for its entirety. The scenery accurately presents equatorial guinea's lush jungles, cocoa plantations and volcanoes. The historical aspect accurately describes the political upheavals between the Spaniards and equatorial guinea's indigenous people. This is a movie that should be in everyone's collection.",1481241600,,479,5.857142857142857
8744169,5,B0196CDINI,"When the Spanish world clashes with the African world for money and wealth, a few people went there for love. But as soon as the tables are turned on the Spanish and justice is finally served, only injustice occurs to those who were in love. As humans we forget to treat each other with dignity and so we always bring injustice to those who are not like us. And this story is a good reminder that it is possible for humanity to come together through love.",1479859200,2,455,4.3023255813953485
