8533903,1,B0091904JI,"This gets 6.4 on IMDB..the cast is approximately 20, with 14 positive reviews. . . Doing the Math, it's obvious that...

Oh never mind! This abuse of time runs  2 hrs and 30 minutes. Briefly, the entire film is some pretentious idiots psychotic episode.. Even the T+A scenes (with some C-scenes) are spastic and constipated.

Though it strives to be the greatest POS ever made....Blue Velvet, Fitzcaraldo and Eraser Head won the awards in that category  decades ago. It's another entry in the hand-held camera genre with neither editing nor a clear vision of what the ""artist"" was trying to say. (If anything).

Given the absolute lack of editing of this monstrosity,I have a feeling that it may have been intended as  a sick waste of time, or a laughable waste of time.  Within  that metric, I believe it is a runaway success.

If you are still  itching to see this bizarre miscarriage of ""art"" , get a girlfriend  (whom you intend to dump)  to rent it, and bring over a lot of alcohol and other stuff. She will be gone before the half way mark, change her phone number, and move to a distant city, before you can reach the um..""credits""  Another ""Mission Accomplished"" in a rather passive-aggressive fashion.

There is neither camp nor decent ""cheese"" to this abomination. Given the run-time...I believe a drug overdose would be  a more satisfying and quicker way to end ones day . If my review seems a bit wordy and pompous,it's because Amazon will not allow me to review something of this quality,with the simpler English which I would have preferred  to use.

I didn't like the movie either!",1349568000,3,1596,4.703971119133574
