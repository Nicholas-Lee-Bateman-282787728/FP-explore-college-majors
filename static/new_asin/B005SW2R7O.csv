4887474,5,B005SW2R7O,"I watched this last night!  I really enjoyed Monica character (Ocean Williams) she was sweet, hardworker, tough at times and had her times when she was unsure about alot of things when it comes to life!  She plays the role of a building manager where she inherits not only her problems. But everybody problems in that building, and let me tell you they are many! From the baby moma who acts like she don't have time for her own kids ( because she too busy partying),  to the older lady Avon that has lost her husband and now she must learn how to take care of herself and her grandson ( by starting all over again),  To helping her niece( who is dealing with teenager problems, trying to be a woman in a little girls body!. ( like so many young girls that I have seen out in the streets with clothes to young for them to wear it is sad thing!. ( Mother' OUT there PLEASE wake Up Before the wrong guy meets your daughter!  She laters reunites with an crazy man from her past!  Don't want to tell you all the movie!  ROBERT TOWNSEND did a very good job with this movie and  I TOTALLY LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!

4887475,4,B005SW2R7O,Opinions will very on this movie....but I enjoyed it.  I rented it on Redbox and intend to purchase it for our singles ministry. I thought it was fairly well written and produced for a low budgeted movie.,1331337600,2,204,4.513513513513513
4887476,4,B005SW2R7O,"I enjoyed this television show, mainly because all of the characters were different. I appreciate how Townsend touched on a diverse amount of issues, such as the transition from being rich to experiencing poverty, racism, single parenting, alcoholism, GED, breast cancer, domestic violence, infidelity, widowhood ETC ETC. Although, I thought that the television show had gaps in the story, I would recommend viewing it on instant for $2.99 versus buying the dvd. Another option would be to visit the website and view MOST of the shows for FREE!

4887477,2,B005SW2R7O,"I felt very disappointed during this movie. I thought it would get better as it went along, but it did not. It would have been a great play that's why I purchased it because I thought it was a play. However, after I seen That Robert Townsend was the writer and noticed some of the actors and actress that played in the film, I decided to give it a shot and not return it. I just expected more from the film than what was actually there. If you really want this movie I will sell it for five dollars.",1330473600,,499,4.05050505050505
4887478,4,B005SW2R7O,"Ok this movie is nothing but the tv servies wrapped up. This is basically seasons one and two in this movie. The series is available online at pic.tv. I think the series is great,but it is too short. Each episode is no more than 15 minutes long. There are a total of 3 seasons so far and on the website season 3 is not completed. Do not know when the new episodes will be available. Mr. Townsend needs to give the people more of this.",1330214400,,434,4.117647058823529
4887479,5,B005SW2R7O,"I love this and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD. I would tell any single mom or otherwise, to watch it!! The cast is remarkable and the storyline is so real, it's puts ""reality shows"" to shame! I would have loved this as a gift, but I don't mind having to pay for it at all!!",1329177600,5,282,3.8793103448275863
