I was thinking, because of the price of $40+ that it was several dvds, it was one and scratched.  It was purchased as a birthday gift and very embarrassing when it was opened.  I returned the item immediately.",1337990400,,296,4.444444444444445

Mr. Gregory is one of the few comedians who can be seen by all of the family.  His act is clean yet hysterically funny.  The content of his tales is primarily based on Southern characters and situations.  However, he is worth watching no matter where you live.",1285718400,,385,4.457142857142857
