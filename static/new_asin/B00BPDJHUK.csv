8572180,5,B00BPDJHUK,"I want to take advantage of this outlet to address the criticisms of the Tracy Anderson Method that I've read here and other places, some of which are valid, and some less so. She gets ripped on a lot, but usually by people who are pushing their political agenda and most of whom have not actually done her program, i.e. the hilarious feminist ""objection"" to her refusal to have women lift more than a small amount of weight, which Tracy is by no means alone in recommending.
Common sense should make it obvious that some of Tracy's rhetoric is just marketing, and each customer has the responsibility to define their goals, do their own research and/ or consult a medical professional before embarking on a fitness journey. It is each trainer's business model to assert that he or she is the end-all be-all of fitness. If you actually watch some of Tracy's interviews, however, she clearly and repeatedly states that your fitness goals are valid even if you don't want to look like a ballet dancer. Many women do, though, and we do not deserve to be shamed about it on the internet.
Another thing Tracy sometimes gets blasted on is her dietary guidelines. To be honest, she and her pal Gwynnie partly deserve it. They are not healthcare professionals and it is a dangerous abuse of their celebrity status to recommend food rules to anyone. But if you choose to follow their advice and get adverse effects, it's your own fault for not applying critical thinking. If you are already more or less are happy with your weight and have a healthy relationship with food (moderation), eat whatever makes you feel good and this program will do great things for you. If you need to lose a substantial amount of weight, go to a credible medical professional and have them layout a food plan that's fitted to you and will not throw you into a mental state of deprivation (very dangerous and bound to backfire).
Tracy talks a lot about  targeting ""smaller muscles"" and gets  criticized for not targeting large ones. First off, I'm no expert in anatomy... but if you've done the Glutecentric program, for instance, you know that your entire posterior is on fire at the end of that, so there's no way ANY muscles get left out.
If you have any sort of knee problems, do yourself a favor and find something else. I don't, but still ended up investing in knee pads that offer both cushioning and stability. The jumping  in the cardio portion took some getting used to, and she does remind you several times to use momentum from arm movements to stay light on your feet. It took some practice, but as promised, it eventually became a lot of fun and completely manageable and invigorating, provided you get into it.
The last (completely valid) complaint that many customers have is that she does not offer enough cues. Personally, it is my favorite part about her...It takes 1-2 times for me to fully learn her workouts, and after that there's no need for all that chirping. 100% matter of preference. There may be a drawback to those who are new to certain types of fitness. I switched to Tracy after having plateaued on Mari Winsor's Pilates, which I did for years. Mari Winsor taught me that controlled movement is everything; both the key to maximizing results and avoiding injury. If you don't have the benefit of a yoga or Pilates background, keep in mind that while some of Tracy's movements may seem jerky and reliant on momentum, they are actually very strategic. You have to stay conscious and deliberate in each motion. Otherwise you're asking for sore joints and pulled muscles.
Tracy's  unimpeachable contribution is that she offers a unbelievable amount of content of truly unique, innovative and effective moves. There is no comparison that I'm aware of. She won't let you get into a rut. I also love that she encourages that good selfishness which makes you feel obligated to show up for yourself and work hard to be your best possible version. Truly inspiring.",1465084800,,3958,4.715317919075145

8572182,1,B00BPDJHUK,"Horrible customer service at the Tracy Anderson website.  She gets lazier and lazier making the workouts as she makes more.  She does something on one side and forgets to do it on the other, she offers lots of instructions on the beginning and then never talks again, the camera focuses on weird angles like her foot so you can't see what she is doing, she moves around into this sort of blurred white zone where you can't see what she is doing, sometimes the workout is incomplete (i.e. arms and abs but no legs), you can tell when they just dubbed together some random workouts to make it look like one continuous one, they also sometimes just flip the image around on the screen so it looks like the other side (right versus left), and she jumps from one sequence to the next leaving you no time to move with her.  Overall, they figured out a way to sell ""variety"" without actually making any variety.",1424044800,,904,4.466666666666667

8572184,5,B00BPDJHUK,"I lost a half inch everywhere and 5 pounds after 30 days and I didn't even do the food program. Yes it is hard, especially if you haven't done high impact work in a while, but I have been doing barre workouts for years without the effects I am getting from this set. I often sub out the cardio dance portion of this set with older TA dance cardio videos or the new Pop Star video to mix it up. If a non-dancer in their 40s can do this and survive, most anyone can. I am not dance or fitness obsessed but have to maintain a certain level of fitness for my health and this thing has me looking downright hot and sleeping well.  Good stuff.",1402531200,9,637,4.055555555555555
8572185,4,B00BPDJHUK,"I got this bc I had just finished P90X and then Insannity and wanted to do a another 90 day program that was geared towards women. I got this when it was over 100 and paid the extra rush shipping too! So.  First time I did this, I thought this was a joke. I laughed a lot and couldn't believe that the moves were actually acceptable workout moves. I did this program didn't get anything out of it. The diet I never followed. I think to really lose weight you have to eat according to the diet that's the key bc you are basically starving yourself on that diet. So I ended up doing HIIT workouts and mostly Jillian Michaels. Well, 2 years later, I got the TA method and beginners DVD. In those DVDs , TA really explains the form you have to use. So I'm back to working out on this again. This time, I get it a little. I'm eating less, don't really like her menu but I'm cutting back. And I have better form and I just add ankle weights and use higher lb weights to get more of aworkout. I am starting to see some tightening and definition. I no longer burst out laughing bc the moves are ridiculous.",1392768000,4,1098,4.130841121495327
8572186,1,B00BPDJHUK,"My wife bought the Hipcentric DVDs and asked me to get this Glutecentric set for her, with the plan to rotate the two one after the other. After two times on Glutecentric she felt like things were TOO familiar and went back to the Hipcentric DVDs to compare... They were the EXACT SAME VIDEOS just different titles on the menus, even the workouts, outfits and voice-over instructions were the exact same at the most ""advanced"" levels between the two sets. Unfortunately we had already thrown out the rest of the materials and box that the DVDs came in so we won't be able to return it....
THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!!!",1380153600,24,618,4.526785714285714
8572187,5,B00BPDJHUK,"I am very happy and now I schedule my excercise every day! It's easy to follow, it's fun and hope I'll soon see the results.",1375833600,,124,4.0
8572188,3,B00BPDJHUK,"If you can actually follow her and keep up, you will be sore the next day. The downfall to this workout is that she doesn't speak during the workout and tell you when she's changing sides or steps. She does it and by the time you look up at the screen, she's already doing the next step and you have to watch her to get the exercise down. I prefer motivation and guidance from the instructor. She does the motions with a closed mouth the entire time.",1370736000,19,450,4.183908045977011
8572189,4,B00BPDJHUK,"I gave Tracy Anderson's Hipcentric a try a few years ago when it first came out. I made it through 42 days of the program before I had to stop since I had so much low back pain.  I was the smallest I've been in my adult life, and so (ah, vanity!), I decided to give it another go-round, this time with Glutecentric.

When I did Hipcentric, I had ordered it before the Body Type Calculator was available on her website.  Hipcentric ended up deflating my booty, which I guess is one of the classic signs that you're doing the wrong Centric.  Before ordering a system, definitely check out her website so you can be sure that you're getting the right set for your body type.

Basically, this set comes with nine Muscular Structure (MS) workouts, each of which you do for ten days.  The MS workouts are a half-hour each, and there is also a thirty-minute Dance Cardio workout that comes in the set, which you're supposed to do each day, too.  In total, you'll be working out an hour a day with this program.

Although the Tracy Anderson Method (TAM) has some problems, it really does give results if you're consistent with the workouts!  Here are some considerations to keep in mind so you can decide if this is right for you.

* Expect to be frustrated.  A lot.  I don't understand why there couldn't be better cueing on this or, especially in this day and age, chapters so you can repeat segments more easily.  I don't always know that I'm doing the correct angles that she is since the cueing is pretty much non-existent in terms of form pointers, but I'm still getting results.

* When you're on the floor, keep in mind that Tracy has her support leg not off to the side, but centered between her arms.  I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it on her blog, and since I started doing this, I've had a much easier time.

* I've found that it really helps to watch it the first time through on a laptop (if you have one) that you leave on the floor in front of you so you don't have to tweak your neck to watch a larger TV.  After the first time I do a new level, I then watch it on my TV.

* Since the second leg has no cueing, I rewind to the first side and do it over again, on the other leg, so I have the benefit of Tracy telling me when to switch exercises.

* Count on some time added in to stretch.  As I said, when I first did Hipcentric and then started Glutecentric, I didn't take time to strech my hip flexors, and really struggled with back pain. I now take time to stretch my hips after each session, and I have no back pain.  Allow yourself 1 hour and 15 minutes total to do all this.

* I find the dance cardio disk to be boring and too high impact for my knees, so I've just been doing other dance workouts, kickboxing, and things like Tonique.

* This is a hard workout!  Really hard!  Expect to be challenged both physically and mentally - but also expect results if you put in the work!

* Yes, her belief that women should only lift three-pound weights is nuts, but when you do high-repetition workouts like this, you can't lift too much more than that anyways.

If you end up hating the program, you could always sell it on the big online auction site.  I did that with my Hipcentric set, and almost recovered the full cost that I had originally paid.

Also, for some odd reason, this set is selling right now for an exorbitant amount.  Shop around and you can locate it for much less.

I hope this review has been helpful!

UPDATE ON 5-30-13:  After the four-week mark of doing Glutecentric, I all of a sudden started getting really ""squishy"" and cellulite-y.  In a panic, I stopped doing the workouts, and moved on to something else.  On the Video Fitness forums, however, there has been a conversation this week about how this ""squishy"" stage is part of the Metamorphosis process.  Supposedly, it happens about four or five weeks in in each of the Metamorphosis series, but then around weeks 5 or 6, things start pulling in again.

Armed with this new information, I'm going to pick back up with where I left off, but I wanted to share this information here in case it helps anyone else who panics like I did!  :-)",1365206400,74,4145,4.314359637774903
