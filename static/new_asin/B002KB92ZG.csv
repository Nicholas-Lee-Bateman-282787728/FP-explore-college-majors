8371795,4,B002KB92ZG,"This biography is very good, but it does not include the most fabulous movie Anthony Hopkins has ever made.....the miniseries  QBV11.  This movie is a true story and got many prizes, and I am surprised the biography does not mention it at all.  QBV11 has the most fantastic court scene at the end  of the miniseries, Mr. Hopkins performance was absolutely WOW.  So, for this reason I rate this movie a 4 star.  Of all the actors in this world, Anthony Hopkins is my number one.",1423267200,,477,4.488372093023256
