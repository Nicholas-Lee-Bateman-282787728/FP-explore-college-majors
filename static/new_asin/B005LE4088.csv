8478104,4,B005LE4088,"Wild East Productions releases two early Euro Westerns that were made and released around the same time as Sergio Leone's Dollars films and before their impact changed the look and feel of the genre.  First up is a West German/Spanish co-production 'A PLACE CALLED GLORY'-1965 , a film which starred Lex Barker and Pierre Brice who were famous for their series of westerns based on the characters of Winnetou and Old Shatterhand by Novelist Karl May.  German filmmakers Alfred Vohrer, Harald Philipp and Hugo Fregonese were behind them but this film was directed by British Director Sheldon Reynolds here billed as Ralph Gideon.  Its combines two storylines, one involving an annual gunfight put up by the town of Glory which involve two hired guns to shoot to the death , the other involving turf wars between a family and gunmen out for the taking.  Barker is a bounty hunter after outlaw Brice but doesn't realize it's him until the concluding gunfight is at hand. Meanwhile, both are caught up in the crossfire of the turf wars and refuse to be hired by either side.  Unfortunately, Reynolds directs the affair with lacklustre flair and if not for some nice photographic compositions by Federico G. Larraya and a rousing score by Angel Arteaga, it would be truly boring.  The villainy is supplied by Gerard Tichy and Aldo Sambrell and the love interest is Marianne Koch who was memorable as Marisol in Director Sergio Leone's 'A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS' -1964.  The showdown motif at the conclusion would be used to greater avail in Director Lamont Johnson's 'A GUNFIGHT'-1971 between Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash culminating in the ultimate contest between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman in Director Sam Raimi's tribute to the Euro western 'THE QUICK AND THE DEAD'-1995.  Much better is the second feature 'THE ROAD TO FORT ALAMO' aka 'ARIZONA BILL' aka 'LA STRADA PER FORT ALAMO'-1966 helmed by non other than the maestro of Italian Horror Mario Bava here billed as John Old. Actor Ken Clark, before his memorable Agent 077 films, plays a soldier on his way home from the Civil War who becomes involved with robbery and Indian uprisings.  Along for the ride is Michel Lemoine in a great role as a psychotic villain, love interest Jany Clair who is quite sultry for this type of oater and in a surprise cameo Gerard Herter who was memorable as the monocled Germanic soldier in Director Sergio Sollima's 'THE BIG GUNDOWN' aka 'LA RESA DEI CONTI'- 1966.  Bava directed in many genres but only did two Westerns of which this is the best.  He is rumored to have helmed and photographed two others but appears uncredited in them.  The photography is by one of the best, Ubaldo Terzano and has many Bava touches throughout the film.  The music score by Piero Umiliani, however, does not seem to mix well with the set pieces and is its only weakness.  This double feature is a prime example of the direction the Euro Western would have headed if not for the examples set by the Dollars films of Sergio Leone.  They appear as nothing more than dolled up versions of their American counterparts with touches of innovations waiting to be explored.  Wild East gives them their usual excellent presentations, both are in their original 2.35 widescreen ratios with 'FORT ALAMO' looking incredibly stunning in its colors and both have their own picture galleries and theatrical trailers.  Highly recommended for students of the genre, it shows how much the Western is truly missed and how many storylines can still be mined to resurrect them.",1327881600,9,3527,4.851666666666667
