7836135,5,6303060072,"Good movie. Anthony Perkins and Mary Tyler Moore both give good performances in this movie. George Schaefer's biopic focuses on Betty Rollin (Mary Tyler Moore), an NBC news correspondent, during her struggle with a breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent surgery. Rollin's husband, Arthur (Anthony Perkins), realizes he can't deal with the burden of supporting an emotionally dependent woman, so Betty considers moving on to a new, healthy relationship with David (Richard Crenna), a more caring man who provides the support she needs during her recovery.",1491004800,,554,5.529411764705882
7836136,4,6303060072,"I bought this to add to my collection of anything that Anthony Perkins did. I think this was one of his best performances, though of necessity he wasn't the central character. That would be Betty Rollins, played by Mary Tyler Moore. I admit I have to read Ms. Rollins' book to understand her motivations. It seemed to me that Betty made the choice to break up her marriage more than that her husband rejected her because of her illness. I think I read somewhere,""when the marriage is bad, end it"", or something to that effect. Granted, I've never been in a long term marriage, but if one has such an attitude about it, why get married at all? Presumably, he flirted and ignored her before they married. She shouldn't have married him in the first place. Then to end it she goes off with a wealthy former lover (Richard Crenna) and trashes him, too. Oh, how I'd hate to be bored and given everything by a rich guy. Mary Tyler Moore's chilliness does make this believable, but not very sympathetic. I'm glad I got this though, Tony gave a good performance in a nice change of pace from his usual scary role. I even bought a book by Arthur Herzog because of this movie.",1359417600,,1166,4.453271028037383
