7731708,4,B01E6ET1TQ,"Wow, Warner Brothers finally put together an official sequel to the Wizard of Oz, Cartoon based of course, and it has Tom and Jerry. This is a very good movie and worth seeing over and over again. Oh, and Tuffie the Mouse is back too! May I add that Tom and Jerry are not essential to the main plot but the premise is quite adorable and fun for children and Oz Fans alike........watch out for the JITTERBUG!!",1466467200,,408,4.311688311688312
7731709,5,B01E6ET1TQ,"Anyone who caught the wonderful adaptation of MGM's 'The Wizard of Oz' with Tom and Jerry will no doubt adore this sequel.  One of the most fascinating elements is how they incorporate the song ""The Jitterbug"", which was filmed for the 1939 movie starring Judy Garland but was ultimately cut in the editing room. 'Back to Oz' was obviously made with great care and is worthy in it's own right. Tuneful, colorful, and humorous for all ages. Instead of a witch, this time the whole gang reunites to save Oz from the Gnome King (voiced by Jason Alexander). Enjoy...",1466208000,4,562,4.6767676767676765

7731716,5,B01E6ET1TQ,"I may be bias , but I really liked this movie.  I worked on a few scenes as an animation clean up artist.  The director, Spike Brandt, is the true successor to the Tom and Jerry series. (he made the last theatrical Tom and Jerry Cartoon with Mr Barbera)  Spike's ability to draw these classic characters rivals the animation masters that helped bring Tom and Jerry to life in the 1940's.  If you love 2-D animation, this is the film for you. Many scenes were painstakingly animated right here in the good ol' USA (Burbank CA to be exact) and the cartoon is entirely drawn, the good old fashion way, right on paper with a pencil.  And the best part about this Tom and Jerry movie.... They don't talk!!!!",1480377600,,702,4.410852713178294

7731724,5,B01E6ET1TQ,"The movie Tom and Jerry Back to Oz deals with the characters of both Tom and Jerry going back to the land of Oz with Dorothy shortly after a visit from some of residents from the Land of Oz.  Much is at stake because one of the businessman threatening to take a great deal of what Dorothys family owns makes a significant amount of money from his cooking (he mentions about making a great deal of money selling a certain fruit flavored barbecue food). Additionally, Tom, Jerry, Dorothy, and the rest of the group end up going to a state fair held in Kansas in order to get vital help from the Wizard who is revered in the Land of Oz. Having the chance to watch the cartoon also helps give me ideas for plot points involving family stories that are turned into movies (I intend to write some books for adults and some separate stories for children under different pennames that are completely different from my current names and other names that I have held in my current lifetime).",1471392000,,981,4.45
7731725,3,B01E6ET1TQ,"I applaud the effort and Jason Alexander is a treat, but it fudges a bit in some regards, like Dorothy wanting to prove herself but ultimately not getting a real chance to do so, and the Cowardly Lion's bizarre game of one-upsmanship in song form with the lady tiger. I do like how they took a cut song from the original 1939 film and used it.",1471046400,,343,4.212121212121212

7731729,5,B01E6ET1TQ,"After I got it and watch it.  I was like; MIND BLOWN and SO AWSOME!  My favorite part is the scenes when Dorothy and Scarecrow embrace each other.  The part when Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion comes to Kanas I go like 'WHOA! I did not see that coming!"" THIS RULES! I love it so much I love to watch it over and over again.  THIS IS AMAZING! There's no place like Oz.",1466553600,,363,3.9315068493150687
8757867,5,B01E6ET1TQ,"This really feeds my inner child while at the same time satisfying everything my outer adult has learned through a lifetime about the material. They who made it, clearly acquainted themselves very well with both the 1939 movie AND L. Frank Baum's series of Oztories, and then had a great deal of fun combining them in a near-seamless garment. Here is a recognizable version of Baum's own Nome King, acting a bit more like his speciously genial earlier Roquat self, but wearing his later name Ruggedo. Here is a character who has to be based on our old friend the Hungry Tiger, although bearing roughly the same relationship to Baum's Hungry Tiger as Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion (Aw, shucks, folks!) bears to Baum's C.L. And here is the Jitterbug, who fell victim to 1939's editorial process but now comes to us restored, as an Ozzy character in his own right. What this Ruggedo does to Emerald City may even echo, in an inverted way, what he does in that Ruth Plumly Thompson Oztory wherein he turns into a giant wearing it for a crown. And here, too, back from ""Tom and Jerry & The Wizard of Oz,"" are Droopy and sidekick.
  The two Tom & Jerry in Oz movies are short enough to watch back to back for a single evening's whimsical entertainment.
  My own complaint is that the crucial invention ought logically to have been the work of the brainy character rather than the one of heart. Still, I think I see why they had to work it out as they did, enabling the inventor to BECOME his invention for the climax.",1526688000,,1507,4.509157509157509
