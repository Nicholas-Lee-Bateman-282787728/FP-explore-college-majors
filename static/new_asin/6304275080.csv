8323910,5,6304275080,"My daughter was easy to potty train so we never used any videos or anything. Then I started watching a friends little boy and he was getting a bit old for diapers. I rented this video from our library and watched it with him in the room. We didn't need a small potty like in the video. After we finished watching it he went to the bathroom, climbed on the potty and went. It was as easy as that. Of course, he was nearly 3 years old. I think the biggest thing for him was knowing what it meant to ""go potty"". This video is great though and I highly recommend it for all parents.",1104451200,4,578,4.034782608695652
