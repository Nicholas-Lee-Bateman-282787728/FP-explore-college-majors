7914695,2,B00001PE5U,"Eat Man is a great manga and I couldn't wait to see Eat Man 98. However, I was very dissapointed. Don't get me wrong, I love the entire concept of Eat Man. A guy who eats metal and turns it into a gun from his right hand is a very nice concept. And I love the woman-in-distress episodes of series (hey, it worked for City Hunter). But the artwork and action in this tape don't do Eat Man any justice is at all. Its like they took a great manga and sliced it up into crappy animation. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is for the terrific dub, though I don't think its worth buying it for. Either way, Eat Man flows the wrong way at every turn. I beg you to read the manga comic instead of waisting your money on a poorly done show like this. The character designs stink and the animation is almost impossable to bear. Avoid this one at all costs.",981158400,,865,4.064327485380117
