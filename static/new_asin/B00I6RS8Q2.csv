8639655,5,B00I6RS8Q2,this hentai is more of a horror story  with some very mild intimate scenes thrown into the story to keep it moving along,1478649600,,120,4.217391304347826

8639659,4,B00I6RS8Q2,Good 4 episode hentai. This hentai had an actual story and everything and it was rather good and entertaining. The sex scenes were all good and well but the story and all that is what really made this a good hentai to watch. I especially loved the horror elements.,1425945600,4,264,4.408163265306122
8639660,3,B00I6RS8Q2,it' was alright,1411948800,2,15,4.333333333333333
8639661,3,B00I6RS8Q2,"It's a good story and all but not a lot of Black masses, seances, summoning demons, or witchcraft. The title is enticing if you like the supernatural. But mostly it's tracking down a mystery killer that claims his victims faces. Set in a vacation resort I thought there would be more hentai. It's decent.",1402617600,10,304,4.648148148148148
8639662,2,B00I6RS8Q2,I've only watched about 1/2 of this and overall I'd say it was pretty tame.  I don't know how this got rated as Hentai.  The story isn't bad but I wasn't looking for a cartoon movie.  If that was what I wanted I would have bought a Disney DVD.,1396828800,4,243,3.9183673469387754
8639663,5,B00I6RS8Q2,"First: this DVD is NOT for children; this film graphically depicts scenes of rape, torture, murder, sex, suicide, and psychological horror. It is the epitome of the NC-17 rating, and probably could never be released in the US as a 'live-action' movie. The ground truth: this film is no different in presentation than the average popular fiction horror novel that you can buy at any bookstore, from Barnes & Noble to Wal-Mart. Novels typically will not shy away from graphic description, particularly horror or suspense novels (examples, anything by Stephen King; Thomas Harris of the Hannibal novels; Anne Rice; or Clive Barker, et al.), and this film is virtually exactly what you would expect to read in a novel of this type--where most film versions of a book will either merely hint at extreme situations if not skip them altogether, MotN revels in a scene-for-scene representation. What I'm getting at is you should not argue that this film is animated porn or gratuitous violence: when readers  read a violent rape scene or murder in a suspense novel, most think nothing of it--MotN simply shows the viewer the same scene as it would have been read. Now that that's out of the way: if you're a fan of Lovecraft, the Cthulhu Mythos, and especially if you read or play Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu game, you will love this movie! The story is broken into three acts. The setting is modern day, Japan and New England. A PI with a Mythos past he can barely remember is drawn into an international conspiracy by the Brotherhood which eventually leads him to New England where he must stop a Necronomicon-wielding cultist from bringing Azathoth into the world. Plenty of Lovecraft references and inside jokes, an interesting story, and pretty good dubbing. You can also watch the film in Japanese with subtitles.",1174780800,2,1810,4.8957654723127035
