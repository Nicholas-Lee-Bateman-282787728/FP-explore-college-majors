5559936,3,B00B6S56X6,"I love Joe, and if you get this you really have to love Joe.  I have his New Day Yesterday Live dvd, the Germany show from Rockpalast, Royal Albert Hall and Beacon blu ray releases, I love them all and they get better with repeated listens!  I accidentally stumbled upon this through a music cable channel, and had it preorder to buy on Amazon.  I watched it, twice just to be sure...i knew alot of the songs performed, however I just couldn't get into it.  It's definitely worth checking out, but how many times will someone enjoy watching this over the Royal Albert Hall.  It's a different side of Joe live (it really is all acoustic) yet I love it when Joe rocks the electric guitar! Again definitely cool to see but spend the money getting his New Day Yesterday Live dvd if you never seen it.",1364169600,8,796,4.387755102040816
5559937,5,B00B6S56X6,"I've seen joe now about 12 times and everytime i see him thinking he can't do anything i haven't seen he does. He has Tone like i've never heard. His projection and the way he puts a song across is second to none. I'll go see him as many times as i can...That's what he deserves!!!

thx Joe for always putting somthing out there that makes me realize why i love music the way i do",1363132800,24,380,4.0
5559938,5,B00B6S56X6,"I also saw Joe on PBS live,on this new release. I purchased his live concert at Royal Albert Hall last year,with special guest star Eric Clapton. WOW!This guy ROCKS!
 I think Mr. Bonamassa is one of the finest guitar entertainment talent available!
 His music and guitar performances are Top Notch! You will be very happy to have any of his concerts. Thank You Joe for the Awesome Music that you do!",1363046400,5,399,4.605633802816901
5559939,5,B00B6S56X6,"Watched this on PBS last night, and I was thoroughly impressed. I have been a fan of Joe for a while, have seen him live with his electric set (even met him at a guitar show once, nice guy). But this set is something altogether different. The music is very stripped down, basic and very authentic American blues type stuff but with a more cosmopolitan feel that shows various influences beyond the blues. To me he really comes across as a new statesman of American blues music, and he owns this stage in Vienna, along with an excellent backing band and about a dozen acoustic guitars of various vintage surrounding him. No blazing or wailing, just lots of impassioned and authentic guitar chops, along with his growing prowess as an authentic blues-based singer, like an old soul channeling Robert Johnson and the classics of the genre for the contemporary era. If you like the blues, Joe or just want to witness perhaps one of the best talents to come along in a long time, get this disk.",1363046400,48,989,4.593220338983051

5559958,5,B00B6S56X6,"Around the time Joe first played the Beacon Theater, I said, Go see this guy while he's still relatively unknown, still playing relatively small venues. I hope you took that advice back then -- because now: too late!  From the Beacon to Radio City, and then the Vienna Opera House (!), and next month, Carnegie Hall.  Joe's stardom is bittersweet for those of us who have followed him from the beginning, since we no longer have him to ourselves; but hey, we knew it was only a matter of time.  This acoustic set is currently running on the PBS loop as part of their fund drive, so you can try before you buy; but it's hardly necessary. Guitar pickers are a dime a dozen, but guitar virtuosi come along once a generation, at most.  If you're a Bonamassa virgin, this video is probably not the place to start; I'd go with ""Live at the Beacon Theater"". (That's me and my daughter in the front row in the audience flashes between numbers.)  If you're a fan -- well, you've already ordered, sight unseen, so why are you still reading?",1449705600,,1030,4.457446808510638

First set was acoustical and second set was his usual touring ""electric"" band.  Loved them both, but was the first opportunity to see and entire acoustical set which was fantastic!!  This DVD features the same musicians I saw with a lot of the same songs.  Just like reliving my live experience except with visual close ups and camera angles that you don't get in person.

5559994,5,B00B6S56X6,"Totally awesome. He is fascinating to watch and it was even more impressive given the short time frame that the group had to get the show together, having only met 3 days prior. I love his other albums and DVDs but the acoustic version is a nice change and really showcases his skills. I can honestly say I have never seen a dobro played in that way! We watched it all the way thru twice in the same evening. Beat the hell out of ""New Year's Rockin' Eve""! Now I put it in just to listen to it when I'm puttering around the house.",1420761600,,529,4.096153846153846

Sometimes acoustic versions of songs can be a bit washed out by comparison, but I was blown away by the power of the music.  An interesting choice of instruments helps round out the overall sound.

Some of which I have never heard of before but combined well with acoustic guitar.  If you are an acoustic guitar lover and like a bit of blues you will love this DVD.  If you are a guitar player, also like me, you will be completely amazed at the skill and abilities of Joe Bonamassa.",1402876800,,440,4.531645569620253

Virtuoso performances from every musician, The 'Arrival' is a stunning piece all of its own, but listen to Athens to Athens for a rollicking good time.

5560028,5,B00B6S56X6,"I learned of this man while he was on some HDTV channel and very much was impressed with his voice, and mostly, his great guitar skills. I always love guys that rely in the blues to do their tunes. (Who doesn't?) He is good and all of his members are too. This is a disc that pretty much never will show up on Netflix, Prime or others. The music rights would cost too much. Just buy it, was it, hear it, and you will enjoy it.",1396483200,,426,3.9651162790697674

5560030,5,B00B6S56X6,This DVD is an excellent acoustic performance by Joe as well as the entire band. I am always a fan of acoustic performances but this one really raised the bar. The quality of musicianship is outstanding. It also highlights just how good of a singer Joe has become to go along with his mind blowing guitar playing. He mics his guitars instead of plugging them in and you can really hear the full natural wood sound of all the wonderful guitars he uses. Sounds like he's in your living room. This is the best sounding acoustic performance I have ever heard. Very nice.,1394841600,,566,4.504854368932039
5560031,4,B00B6S56X6,"One of the best concerts of any kind I've seen in years. Wonderful song selections and virtuosic performances from everyone involved. So why just 4 stars? Well, several minor flaws, imo:

1. The omission of a bass player was intentional to give the other instruments and the vocals more ""air"", but a bassist like Danny Thompson or Edgar Meyer could have added immeasurably, I think. Bad call.

2. The inclusion of the Swedish Nyckelharpa is interesting, but a tad redundant when you have a fiddler like Gerry O'Connor on board. More a novelty than a solid contribution in a small combo. Another instrument choice would have been better.

3. Don't get me wrong, I love Joe's guitar playing, and he came up with some captivating arrangements for this concert, but a few of the songs' guitar parts sounded a bit repetitive, and his leads make it clear that while he is a wonderful acoustic player, there are a number of better ones (Tommy Emmanuel, Richard Thompson, Bruce Cockburn and Kelly Joe Phelps come to mind, just to name a few).

Do not, however, let these minor reservations keep you from experiencing this remarkable performance. If you're a Joe fan you'll love it, and if you're not, this show just might make you one. I recommend the CD/mp3 versions as well.",1394755200,,1268,4.75

5560034,5,B00B6S56X6,"If you're a Joe fan you already know what I mean and know what to expect. Joe rolls in with some uber-rare Martins, Gibsons, a National Dobro and some others that will keep you guitar buffs drooling. The band assembled for An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House is first rate! They play an array of antique and unique (plastic water bottle w/ stones in it) instruments for a sound like no other.
Which brings me to something you don't often enough these days. Sound Quality. Joe still cares. In an industry that has moved away from quality sound to smaller and smaller file sizes to speed down-load time. Joe has obviously assembled an equally skilled technical staff to record and produce this concert (as he does all his releases) with some of the sound and image quality you could hope for.  Put this on a really good system and watch and listen.",1393200000,,856,4.558441558441558

5560059,5,B00B6S56X6,Really great playing by Joe Bonamassa and the band. All acoustic set with multiple acoustic guitars played with Joe's superb blues style. His voice is too high pitched for my taste and yet it is a magical concert although a contrabass would have filled out the void left by not having one in the band.,1389484800,,301,4.490909090909091
5560060,1,B00B6S56X6,"I love this DVD, I am always impressed with Joe. The description of this product said 2 CDs /DVD/ bluray, Implying I would CDs DVDs and blu ray, I received 2 DVDs. I was very disappointed to not received what I ordered.",1389312000,,219,4.238095238095238
5560061,5,B00B6S56X6,"I will say the same about this DVD as I did the CD that I bought of this same thing. I love all of Joe Bonamassa's music, but I actually prefer the acoustic instruments over the high energy electric guitars. The CD is great, but the DVD of ""An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House"" is exceptionally great! Just like being in the front row at one of his magnificent concerts!",1388793600,,380,4.291666666666667

5560067,5,B00B6S56X6,"Really? Why do I like this? Are you kidding me! He is a master of his craft - an accomplished vocalist (I could listen to him sing all night even without the guitar- all that practice really turned him into a superior singer) and a joy to watch perform.  The acoustic portion of his tour is what's on this and it's wonderful to watch him play so many different guitars so well.  Joe is amazing and this release is just what we wanted. We're huge acoustic fans of his and having just that portion of his show made this one of our most treasured dvd's.  Rock on Joe B!  You should buy it, it's wickedly good.",1386806400,,606,4.198275862068965
5560068,5,B00B6S56X6,"Once upon a time back in the late '60s and early '70s, I loved going to coffee houses because of the spontaneity that could happen when two or more artists decided to play, mixing different instruments and styles, just to see what could happen when they went exploring together.
This concert is very much like that.",1386806400,,315,4.642857142857143
5560069,5,B00B6S56X6,"This video is fantastic for the way Joe incorporated different folk instruments into the ensemble. This is a Joe Bonamassa blues concert featuring fiddle, washboard, and a nikelharpa (you have to see that ). Add Joe's muriad acoustic guitars and you get a very enjoyable mix.

This concert really showcases not only Joe's talent as a guitar player but hi talent for composition and arranging as well...",1386720000,,402,5.0
5560070,4,B00B6S56X6,Joe brings his great playing and smoky vocals as usual! The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I found the acoustic versions a little less exciting than an electric show.,1386028800,,182,4.382352941176471
5560071,5,B00B6S56X6,"Love Bonamassa, love this album and DVD.  I was afraid that the acoustic recordings wouldn't be as good as what he's done in the studio, but I actually like some of the songs better.  The DVD was a great pleasure to watch---helped give me a better sense of Joe and what he's about onstage.  His backing musicians were also awesome, each adding something very unique to this album.  Really loved the addition of a fiddle!  I've been listening to Bonamassa since around 2006, and this is probably my favorite of his recordings.  Although----I adore the two albums he did with Beth Hart, especially Don't Explain.  Best song ever (recorded on Seesaw) is Strange Fruit.  Beth's voice is awesome, and Joe paints the scene in a breathtaking way with his guitar.",1385769600,,755,4.753846153846154

5560073,5,B00B6S56X6,"I cannot tell you how good this is in this little review box. You can't box in Bonamassa! If you like Guitar Driven Rock, Blues, Blues Rock, Jazz - all from a very young guy who not only writes his lyrics but also his music and it's actually good - you want this. This guy is the most under-rated musician you have never heard of. When you hear this (hopefully through real speakers - not amped up bass boosters from hell)  you will hear music - like it's the first time. I accidentally found him and bought 2 CDs.
Then I went to a used CD shop and bought the rest of his entire catalog (new & unopened) including the 2 CDs with Beth Hart and his first rock band's CD and his other pet project Rock Candy Funk Party. Then I found the DVD concerts and then the blu rays concerts. I'm tellin' you ""Get up off-a that thing"".........and buy ALL OF IT. You WILL thank me.....",1384732800,,870,4.178571428571429

5560076,5,B00B6S56X6,"I saw part of this while in a hotel in New Orleans. I had to ""Shazam"" it with my phone to find out who the artist was. When I got home, I bought it on Itunes and have listened to it for a couple of months. This is a real unique experience especially if you like acoustical guitar music! Liked it so much, I decided to buy the video to see the rest of the concert.",1383350400,,363,3.789473684210526

5560084,5,B00B6S56X6,"Anyone who is a novice up to a maestro will appreciate Joe's ""jaw dropping"" guitar playing. I have several of his electric blues/rock albums but to actually see him play an acoustic through a microphone with a band assembled in a few days from other famous international musicians is an exceptional experience. I would recommend this to any one who is a serious music lover.",1378771200,,374,4.769230769230769
5560085,5,B00B6S56X6,Wonderful musicianship from every group member and beautiful acoustic works in a glorious setting.  Couldn't recommend more highly.  Joe's skills just get better and better every year.  Can't wait to catch him in concert at the end of the year.,1378425600,,244,5.05

I'm not going to sit down in front of my TV every time I want to listen to this.  I think it's a rip-off to triple the profits on the same product, they should format it to allow you access if you buy the Blu-Ray disc. I believe in the artist getting his fair share of income for his efforts but this is why people set up peer to peer networks.",1378339200,,520,3.7962962962962963

5560095,5,B00B6S56X6,"Loved it. I highly recommend it. It is a wonderful mix of acoustic guitar and percussion.  Joe Bonamassa was exceptional and proved that he can play all types of music.  I also thought that Lenny Castro turned in an exceptional performance on the hand drums. I normally play guitars, banjos and piano, but I was so impressed with his performance, the next week, I went out and bought a West African Djembe and have been playing it ever since.",1376092800,,442,4.582278481012659
5560106,5,B00B6S56X6,"This concert is truly wonderful. Even if I hadn't known that the performers got together only 72 hours before the show I would have been impressed with how well they worked together. There is good variety in the music. It ranges from blues to bluegrass to ballads and beyond. It is entirely acoustic and includes some unusual instruments such as nyckelharpa, harmonium, and glockenspiel. It was recorded very well and is spectacular on the Master Audio track on the blu-ray disc. This is definitely something to listen to again and again. I can't imagine it would ever become boring.",1375747200,,583,4.898989898989899

5560110,3,B00B6S56X6,"I enjoyed this video, but there is a lot of ""sameness"" throughout. An interesting diversion for Bonamassa fans, but it shows why he's known for his electric work, not acoustic.",1374883200,,176,4.9

5560115,5,B00B6S56X6,"The collection of songs performed acoustically in this concert is simply outstanding.  Aside from being perhaps the best guitar virtuoso of the age, Bonamassa shows great talent and flexibility in transforming ""electronic"" music to the ""acoustic"" platform and his vocals truly shine in this medium.  The short-notice, coordinated choreography of the talented musicians performing this concert is not only a testament to their individual skills, but to Bonamassa himself for pulling them into his music.  While Bonamassa is the star, no one is pushed to the side in the process.  Each is featured in a way to showcase their individual artistry.  You can see the appreciation for one another in their spontaneous glances and smiles as they perform.  These musicians truly enjoyed each other and the music they shared.  You, as the viewer/listener will too!  I cannot think of a better piece of music culture than this DVD recording in Vienna.  You will want to view it over and over.",1373500800,,981,5.08125

5560129,5,B00B6S56X6,"This is a record of a true master and showman at his trade. Joe enjoys playing to the audience as he works his magic on his instruments. I especially like that he brought other musical masters into the show with him, it was a joy to watch them working together on stage.

Special note to Joe: As with many musical talents and no matter how good they are, after they establish their style the songs start to sound similar to each other and close to the same presentation. It takes a real effort to break out of ones own style for the sake of musical diversity.",1373068800,,559,4.273584905660377

A great listen when your just sitting on the porch in the early evening with a great cigar and your ""spirits"" of choice.
  If i had to be critical of one thing it would be maybe Joe could learn another guitar solo, i personally have seen him play ""dream i was dying"" 5 different times, but if you have never heard it then it won't be an issue. It is amazing.",1372636800,,529,4.176470588235294

5560148,4,B00B6S56X6,"I've become a big fan of Joe Bonamassa.  I enjoyed this filmed concert more for the quality of the sound and cinematography than for the music - I think I just like other styles of acoustic music better.  His Albert Hall video is the best, followed closely by his NYC video.

I see this amazing artist and have to shake my head at the wave upon wave of junk that is crammed down the throats of young people today. All of Bonamassa's live DVD's are well worth owning and well worth showing to the uninitiated. It is a true pleasure to watch a naturally gifted musician, but Bonamassa's more than that. He has taken his natural talent and worked his backside off to nurture it, hone it and polish it until it appears effortless.

If you enjoy watching any kind of artist in their creative element --and especially if you're a fan of music-- get this DVD (or any of his others). It's something you'll view over and over again.  Oh, and spread the word!",1367712000,2,781,4.531914893617022

This is something altogether different.
Joined by an amazing group of world musicians, something new emerges.
It's basically the blues, but with a twist.
All acoustic, with celt, euro, & world instrumentation ... wow!
The chemistry is amazing.
This won't appeal to die-hard fans who want the electric Joe.
It will, however, satisfy musical wants and needs most folks don't know they had.
Highly recommended.",1367625600,,515,5.216867469879518
5560171,5,B00B6S56X6,Creative take on some of his best work.  Exceptional quality recording. The interplay between the banjo and Joe make for some great moments.

5560183,5,B00B6S56X6,"Primarily a guitar rocker of the first order, Joe switches gears and lowers the decibel level with this innovative concert film.  Joining him are some diverse musicians like Gerry O'Connor (banjo & fiddle), Mats Wester (nyckelharpa & mandola), Arlan Schierbaum (harmonium, accordion, piano & glockenspiel) and Lenny Castro (percussion).  This concert reminded me of Bruce Springsteen's journey into folk music with ""The Sessions Band.""

Bonamassa tone things down and as the title suggests, discards the big power amps.  As usual he glides his way through 9 or 10 guitars including some vintage ones.  Many of the songs are his own including the well-received ""Driving towards the Daylight.""  At the same he finds some other songs by Tom Waits, Robert Johnson, Paul Rodgers and others work for this set.  Interspersed during some of the song transitions are brief comments by the band members.  While they are short enough not to interfere with the pace they are somewhat distracting.  Not a big deal.

The audio quality is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is excellent as you might expect.  There is also a lossless 2.0 stereo mix.  An excellent 1080p transfer works well with the low stage lighting.  The direction is very good with plenty of focus on the players and their nimble fingers at work.  Excellent all around.",1366588800,9,1317,5.037037037037037

They gave my husband and me a taste of what we could expect on concert night.  And, we were not disappointed.  Kicking off his concert with some acoustic songs prepared us for the rest of an awesome evening.  It didn't take long for us to realize that we were in the midst of musical greatness.  Joe's voice has developed a richness and maturity that rivals some of the greatest singers of our time.  He's correct when he spoke about not having the ability to hide your mistakes  when performing acoustic.  I very much prefer this format if you're good enough, and he is.  I can't wait to see where he goes from here.  As long as he continues to perform, we will be at his concerts.  So, don't knock acoustic because many of us boomers would not know the correct lyrics to ""Layla"" if Clapton hadn't gone unplugged!  Thanks Joe.",1366156800,3,956,4.585798816568047

5560192,5,B00B6S56X6,"Joe Bonamassa's Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House is a musical triumph. Producer Kevin Shirley teamed up four fantastic musicians to play with Joe: Gerry O'Connor from Ireland, Mats Wester from Sweden, & Arlan Schierbaum & Lenny Castro from the U.S.A. These five artists had never before met, & after 72 hours played together in this concert with amazing precision & beauty. Along with the 12 guitars Joe used, the other musicians added an Irish banjo, fiddle, mandolin, mandola, baby piano, nyckelharpa, harmonium, accordion, glockenspiel, & a host of ethnic percussion instruments. The music they produced has a blues base but also includes a bluegrass & country-folk sound. Joe's voice has reached an impressive level of maturity & his acoustic guitar work ranks him with the best in the world. In Joe's own words ""this was a risky venture"", however, it was not only successful it is Joe's greatest achievement. This concert reminded me of Ry Cooder's documentary ""Buena Vista Social Club"", & Joe's slide guitar work on track #8 has a strong Ry Cooder sound to it. All five of these musicians played together like a finely made Swiss watch & improvised perfectly giving all the compositions a unique an entertaining sound. The Vienna Opera House was the ideal location for this concert.",1365465600,16,1298,5.0418604651162795

5560195,5,B00B6S56X6,"Intriguing to listen to Joe's songs (most of them) played in a completely different manner. This set is all acoustic, no bass guitar or full drum kit which lets you hear all the notes within his guitar work. For some reason I found it all very relaxing. If you can find it, listen to him sing on the ""Rockapalast"" dvd some years ago and you'll understand how accomplished a vocalist he is today.

My favorite: ""Sloe Gin"". If this rendition does not move you nothing will.",1365206400,,471,4.476744186046512

I was hooked. I first saw the Performance at the Beacon Theatre which; was brand new at the time (2011) on PBS I bought that DVD also. During that performance Joe introduces you to Beth Hart, a phenomenal vocalist. That performance not only convinced me to Support my local PBS but also provided me with tickets to a live performance in Youngstown Ohio where I sat within conversational distance of the stage before the music started. I have since bought several of his recordings and will always be a fan.
I have seen this performance, once again thanks to PBS and will see him this year in Cleveland when he appears at the end of the year. The reason that I'm writing this review today is because when I ordered the CD I didn't order the Blu-Ray DVD. I look forward to every thing that he does. It's wonderful when you find an artist so creative and who is in full stride. Rock on Joe!!!",1364601600,,1134,4.328638497652582

He's the single best tenor, or four-string, banjo player in the history of the planet.  That's not an exaggeration.  It's a demonstrable fact. Originally from Garrykennedy in County Tipperary, Ireland, Gerry played with the Ormond Ceili Band under the legendary button accordionist Paddy O'Brien from Nenagh and was a member of such Irish traditional groups as the Wild Geese, Arcady, and Four Men and a Dog.  Gerry is also a proficient fiddler and mandolinist. Check out his solo album NO PLACE LIKE HOME to understand what I mean.",1492387200,,712,4.957983193277311
