2839034,5,B000QJFSQQ,"I usually don't bother with reviews. But i had to post that this was the best yoga DVD I have ever seen.  From the production value to Marc Lewis' instruction, this DVD is of the highest quality.  In particular, Marc gives clear, complete explanations and instruction while keeping the energy up and positive. Truly a great find.",1238976000,,329,4.754385964912281
2839035,5,B000QJFSQQ,"I had a chance to watch the DVD and also to take Marc's class. Both are excellent sources of joy and focus.
Enjoy this video as it's the second best thing after taking a live class with Marc in LA.",1238025600,,197,3.95
2839036,5,B000QJFSQQ,"A very thorough and balanced workout.  It is a long DVD so beginners don't feel you have to do it all, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  He has a disarming presence and peaceful voice.",1215388800,4,194,4.216216216216216
2839037,5,B000QJFSQQ,Marc's DVD is the perfect substitute when I can't make it to his class. Not only does he offer a great workout but he also reminds me how to get the most out of my yoga session through proper breathing and staying mindful of what postures my body can and can't do. Learn from Marc and get the most out of your yoga practice.,1215388800,3,324,4.078125
2839038,5,B000QJFSQQ,"I was seriously surprised to find that I had to take breaks and even modify a couple of the poses in this DVD. I've been doing yoga for 11 years, and I have a strong practice. I've never thought of workout video/DVDs as particularly challenging but this one was.

Marc put together a really tough 90 minute session that was completely balanced in terms of hitting all the body parts and muscles. He included all of the basic asanas and held positions long enough where you felt it. He did a couple of really challenging series of poses (one side and then the other). Each time i was sure he was done with the first side, he would go to another pose on the same standing leg and really push you. I even yelled an obscenity or two at the screen at one point, but felt really good because I knew I was pushing myself.

I liked that he continually gave alternatives or modifications to challenging poses and that he was good about pointing out poses that would be good to skip if you had particular injuries.

One thing I noticed was a couple of times in the beginning of the DVD I felt like the music overpowered his voice which made it hard to hear at times, but it seemed to balance out better as the DVD went on. Also, he didn't teach upward dog at all and just kept it to cobra in the sun salutations which i found a little strange. I guess all teachers have their own way of teaching sun salutations and it's easy to modify if you do it differently.

Overall, I felt really good afterwards and will definitely do this practice again.",1214265600,5,1535,4.301038062283737
2839039,5,B000QJFSQQ,"This dvd is great and it's approachable by almost anyone. What I like is that he gives you options or ""adjustments"" on each pose so it suits where your body happens to be at...the pace is steady and i broke a sweat. What I also like is that it is straightforward yoga and easy to pick up... He also has a soothing voice which is always a help especially during the cool down/ meditation period of the dvd. I liked it and so will you.",1212796800,5,433,4.105882352941176
2839040,5,B000QJFSQQ,I have been doing yoga for 15 years and Marc wore me out!  This is a fantastic workout!!,1211760000,5,88,3.888888888888889
2839041,4,B000QJFSQQ,"Set in India I believe, this is presented/narrated by Dr. Ananda Baayogi Bhavanani from India & other dvds are on their site: www icyer com
Set outsides shows 8 people (most exercises only use 1 person at a time) of different races, sizes, age & gender. Can be played in English, French or Spanish w/subtitles on or off. Sitar music is played in the background & I found it soothing.
The poses are demonstrated about 2x each on EACH side while it's being narrated on how to do it properly, benefits to the body, modifications, and who shouldn't do the poses. Almost all poses he suggests 3x on each side.

Schedules for workout: 3 min
no words just says 2 schedules & gives quick video or pictures of what poses to do

At first I did not like it didn't give much info on how to do it more the many other professional yoga workout dvds, but I liked that you are told how each pose benefits the organs/system or helps heal a condition. As time went on, he gave modifications, more instruction on when to inhale/exhale, what poses people with certain conditions. Most times you're given less instruction as time goes on, on this, you're given more. His spoke eloquently, though obviously w/an accent, so the subtitles came in handy.
This would be prefect it was structured as 2 workouts to follow along since the instruction was so well done.",1207526400,,3563,4.9966329966329965

8196553,1,B000QJFSQQ,"No digital copy will be provided even if you contact customer service.
It is also not necessarily a  yoga, just a set of exercises.",1512518400,,131,4.458333333333333
8196554,5,B000QJFSQQ,"Love this workout!  I feel terrific afterwards.  It's thorough and tough, but doable for a beginner like me.  I look forward to getting stronger and more flexible with every use!  I'm so happy I stumbled upon this DVD.  Thanks so much!",1428105600,,235,4.634146341463414

I also liked the speed and the order of the elements.",1361059200,,111,4.6
8196556,5,B000QJFSQQ,I use it in a rotation of videos to keep in shape along with other exercise modalities.  It's a great workout and I would recommend it to anyone.,1357516800,,145,4.178571428571429
8196557,5,B000QJFSQQ,"Although this is called 'Yoga for Weightloss', I use it to keep my body strong and aligned. It is basic, but not easy. The cues are easy to follow and body smart. The poses can easily be modified until the practioner can do the full pose. This is beneficial to advanced althletes as well as beginners.",1297123200,2,301,4.392857142857143
8196558,5,B000QJFSQQ,"I really enjoy this DVD.  I've been practicing yoga on and off for 3 years now, and would consider myself an Intermediate level Yogi.  This DVD is challenging enough that you do not get bored, but easy enough for a beginner to not get discouraged!  The poses are easy to follow with (my favorite) modifications to enhance your yoga experience!  One of the best YOGA dvds I have ever purchased!",1286323200,4,393,4.571428571428571
8196559,5,B000QJFSQQ,"This Yoga instruction is the best I got so far and I love practicing it. Mark has done an excellent job with this. His instructions are perfect and he has a calming voice which is surely a plus. I'm sure it will make you feel great, sweaty and relaxed while toning out your body. I highly recommend this to everyone!",1283472000,,316,4.283333333333333
8196560,5,B000QJFSQQ,"MY MMA(mixed martial arts) coach suggested to a couple of us that we take up yoga for our balance and flexibility. You can imagine at first I was a little resistant, But... I finally gave in. I marched my self down to one of these local corporate gyms and sardined my self in with about 2 dozen other people for an hour. It was a nightmare. Although it seemed others were enjoying it, I was not. The class consisted of allot of moves that were to advanced or down right intimidating. Also it felt as if they went on for ever, causing my mind to wonder.
 I have no Idea why I brought this up to a lady in the laundry room of my apartment building, but I did. She suggested I try a place in Santa Monica. A power yoga class. She said it was allot different than the conventional Yoga that most places offer.
 So, why not?
I started with Marc Lewis's class on a monday night. It was great. The moves he put together were fantastic. They fit better with what I was doing. My muscles felt as if they were being toned and sculpted right there on the spot. Not to mention every posture came with an alternative in case it was to difficult or not difficult enough. It was only by luck that I had brought two towels because by the middle of the class I had lost a pound of water weight.
I've been doing his class for a month now. I also own his dvd which is essentially his class in the comfort of your own home. I recommend both highly.
I never thought i'd be saying this but.......""Namaste""",1254787200,,1483,4.181818181818182
