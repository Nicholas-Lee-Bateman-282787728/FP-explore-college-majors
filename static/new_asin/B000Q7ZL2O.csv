8195070,5,B000Q7ZL2O,"I found the first of this series for $1.50 in a drugstore bargain bin, and took it home to my son.  We couldn't get over the quality animation and the funny and interesting storyline and dialogue of this Discovery Channel Kids production.  My grandsons came over  and after watching it just begged to borrow it.  So I got on good old Amazon and found the rest of the series.  I purchased (from Amazon, of course)  the three set for my 9 year old grandson's birthday.  I'm 62 years old and I love to watch them!  Also, the Discovery Channel gives you a real lesson in ancient Egypt as a bonus with every DVD in the series so it is educational!  Then there is a fun QUIZ with little sassy Tutenstein to play along with Cleo.  The character Tutenstein is a cute little monster of a Pharaoh who,  if he doesn't get his way, deems it a ""blasphemy"" against his exalted person!  Consequently,  it gets himself and Cleo into all kinds of hilarious trouble.  You won't regret buying this one.",1374192000,,983,4.418994413407821

8195072,5,B000Q7ZL2O,"I love all the tutenstein DVD's and episodes but I just don't like the new voice of tutenstein, it's so hard to adjust after being so used to hearing the old voice. I wish they had the entire Tutenstein seasons on DVD not just some episodes",1345507200,2,240,4.239130434782608

8195074,5,B000Q7ZL2O,"Both my son and myself adore this show, the animation is great, stories interesting, and characters very funny. Why do all the good ones get cancelled?",1262649600,,151,4.846153846153846
8195075,4,B000Q7ZL2O,This is a cute take off on a Egyptian Pharoah in modern times with a sister who lost her father back in ancient times. A diffferent cartoon recommended for the kids and adults alike. The Pharoah Tutenstein is hilarious. Reminds me a little of Mummies alive.,1257984000,,257,4.608695652173913
