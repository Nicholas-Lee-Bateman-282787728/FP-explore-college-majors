8523762,5,B0080R5U1Y,"After War Gundam X started off the same as its predecessors. Space colonies rebelled and what not. Dropped their home on Earth and turning it into a desert wasteland.
Then a small group of goods guys comes along to help find Newtypes before others do.
The main character and hois friends use three new Gundams to help fight the world and space.
Excellent: 1-10
10+",1351382400,,364,4.615384615384615
