BUT THE WRAPPING OF THIS PRODUCT WAS HORRIBLE.  The ends were not taped and the package was open when I got it. Thank goodness nothing was stolen or fell out.",1416700800,,302,4.101694915254237
8534158,4,B0091G7BDI,this review wood be more bit the disc with gods gun -death rides a horse plus is waste of a disc you would be better with the 8 disc version and help towards saving the planet .the rest of the films are more than acceptable for the price.  HAPPY TRAILS,1355616000,,252,4.04
