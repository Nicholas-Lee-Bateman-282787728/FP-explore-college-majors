8521778,4,B007TI54JI,"First off: This 2-disc set is in FRENCH - with optional Palombian - and it's in PAL format, so if you're in North America, you will need a region-free DVD player.
Alain Chabat might be described as a French version of Adam Sandler, so that's about the level of comedy you can expect here, the CG animated Marsupilami is wonderful, and the movie is funny in a crass sort of way (Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, Roseanne Barr, Jerry Seinfeld, etc. etc. etc.), but Disneyfied US parents might take offense to some parts of it.
I wish they would have just stuck to filming the original Andr Franquin comic book [I]La queue du Marsupilami[/I], which would have required far fewer actors and would have probably been a much better movie.
The 'making of' second DVD has TONS of special features and is very good.",1468713600,,814,4.620689655172414
