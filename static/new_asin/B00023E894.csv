2059107,4,B00023E894,"I know that it has not been released yet so how can I give it four stars and review the set?  Because, ok that was not much of a reason, however Batman The Animated Series set the bar at a time when animation was in a rut.  Paul Dini and Bruce Timm created a movement with this ""cartoon"".  The animation was sleek and stylish but what really set it apart simply put was and is the stories.  Each episode was written on a level that I feel has yet to be matched.  The acting was brillant, yes I said acting, the voice talent they assembeled was perfect, Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Richard Moll, Paul Williams, Bob Hasting and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. just to name a few.  Add in the fact that each episode had an orginal music score, who can argue that Batman The Animated Series is one of the best if not the best verisons of Batman ever created.  That is what the rating is on, all I know for sure is that it is four discs, if I have to guess it will probably be just half of season 1 maybe less.  It is about time Warner released this as a boxed set, they need to get there rear in gear when it comes to these things.  I will post another review when I get more information.  As for now all I can say is FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1083110400,6,1224,4.105042016806722

2059109,5,B00023E894,I absolutely loved this wonderful volume of arguably the best cartoon tv series along with X-Men: The Animated Series. The packaging was fantastic and no damage was found on the DVD set. The artwork done for the show is magnificent. The voice acting by Kevin Conroy and the supporting cast of characters was enjoyable. Overall I am happy to have bought the first volume of what is testament to the talents of those who worked on Batman: The Animated Series and a honorable platform for the The Dark Knight.,1513555200,,506,4.696629213483146

2059125,5,B00023E894,"I am Shere Khan.

 This will be my brief review of Batman: The Animated Series. This is in my opinion a legendary animated superhero show. Definitely one of the top biggest of the nineties, if not the biggest of them all alongside Superman, X-Men etc. This is also a perfect example how America will never make cartoon series the way they used to, what with the pathetic modern day CGI technology that looks way inferior to this Batman show. But aside from
the fact that as a show it is the definition of the word perfection, the series itself is perfect with a capital P-E-R-F-E-C-T with how it depicts the character of Batman and his arch enemies that everyone knows and loves as well as the side characters such as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon.

 The animation is stellar spectacular. Each and every character has unique designs to them as well as the city of Gotham itself looks dark, gloomy, and not to mention dangerous and nerve-racking. The music is ominous and suspenseful btw the theme songs for Batman and the Joker are perfect representations of the characters. For a cartoon show, pretty much every episode had much depth to it with its characters and some of those dark themes are so ""dark"", going back to watch these episodes, I get surprised to realize those themes were added in a cartoon for kids (as a kid myself once, I remember certain times feeling disturbed by some aspects about the show). The series is ominous by the mere presences of the antagonists of every episode ( the Joker, Scarecrow, Two-Face, and Clayface) are some of the ones that appear the most disturbing.

 The voice acting is superb. Every time I think of the characters in Batman for their most accurate representations, Batman: The Animated Series is that representation. From appearances to voice acting, the one that stands out to most out of all is the Joker, voiced by none other than Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker).He is the highlight of the show, with many of the best lines, scenes, and humor coming from him. The many great legends who have portrayed the Joker, Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, cannot hold a candle to Mark Hamills' spectacular Joker voice. Two words best describe him when people compare him to others who have portrayed the character: BAR NONE. Every laugh he lets out is miracle, absolute
miracle. The same goes for Batman who looks and sounds terrific like he should sound. The rest of the characters, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, the Penguin, all stand out as perfection. Heck even Robin looks and sounds great. Alfred and Gordon are awesome. Awesome defines the show.

 The show has great action too. From buildings and vehicles exploding, to intense vehicle pursuits, to Batman himself kicking the snot out of thugs who dare try to go against him, and of course epic showdowns between the caped crusader and his arch nemesis's that involve some of the best hand to hand combat fights ever seen in cartoons. Last thing I need to say is that parents should be careful to let their children see this series as some of the images, action, and disaster could be scary for them.

 Finally in terms of the product and the delivery, it was a complete success. No complaints except joy cuz I'm very happy with these discs. So far they all work like a charm. And hopefully, it'll be like that for a long time. Some of the episodes that stand out to me in this collection are ""Christmas with the Joker"", ""Heart of Ice"", ""Two-Face Parts I & II"", ""Nothing to Fear"", and ""Pretty Poison"".",1498780800,,3518,4.696428571428571

2059155,5,B00023E894,"Batman TAS is one of the best animated shows ever.  There aren't too many animated shows you get to see gangsters weilding Tommy Guns and actually using them.  If you are a parent that is paranoid about your child seeing shooting and action this is not a show you would like, but i would like my kids to be raised like I was so I don't see anything too over the top that would be inappropriate unless your child can't handle people getting hurt cause there are definitely some seriously injured characters.  That being said I will say the voice acting is great, Batman/Bruce Wayne and the Joker are standouts, the animation is amazing and surprisingly very fluid during fight scenes which is something most shows fail at.  If you are like me(an older guy that grew up on shows like this and you love animation) this is a must have show especially if you want a break from shows heavy on corny humor and overly cute character(although there are some ""cute"" characters on this show) this is a serious, dark, very entertaining show.",1468540800,,1029,4.576086956521739

This set (Volume One) has a few of my favorite episodes: ""Christmas With the Joker"" (where I still think Bullock's dialogue, after Joker removes a candy cane from his mouth, was much different from what's currently used), ""P.O.V.,"" ""Beware the Gray Ghost"" (which is simply marvelous, and quite inspired through using Adam West to voice the old-time stereotyped serial hero). If you have never seen the series before, this is a great way to start - at the beginning. I will mention, the first episode, ""On Leather Wings"" is definitely not what one might expect form a Batman-series. Still, the animation work and writing comes through, and maintained a high standard, at least through the first two seasons.

On a side note: I have noticed difficulty removing discs from the plastic style clips used in this case - but once removed, they do tend to come out easier the next time.",1455926400,,923,4.80503144654088

I would give anything if he would get in touch with me so he can do my voicemail message. I think that would be awesome. Should any of you know Mr. Conroy feel free to send him towards this account. I am very polite and generally not concerned with celebrity status, so I think we could work something out.

2059179,5,B00023E894,"I will start again with the audio commentary! With ON LEATHER WINGS and HEART OF ICE the shows creaters Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Eric Rodominski and Boyd Kirkland strove to create animation that looked like it was made in 1940s while being made in the 1990s! ON LEATHER WINGS has Bruce Timm mentioning how dark the backrounds are to get the look of film noir and HEART OF ICE mentions the dust specks that are enlarged with the photography. Bruce says that while the old film techniques have some drawbacks there can be no denying the rich look of old cel animation techniques!

The battle of Batman and the Man-Bat is just startling and Mark Singer's vocal performance changing into Man-Bat is horrifying! Kirk Langstrom's wife, Francine was voiced by one of the ""Pettycoat Junction"" girls and Eric Rodominski got kissed by her and his crush for her was fullfilled!

Most of the episodes have highlights of some or another. In I'VE GOT BATMAN IN MY BASEMENT the Penguin is tharted by a pair of child detectives while Batman beats the fowl bird and retrives a rich jeweled egg! In volume 2 BIRD OF A FEATHER would out do this one as Veronica Reland, the rich socialite would date Oswald Chesterfeild Cobblepot alias the Penguin in a comic encounter that would bewilder Batman!

In TWO FACE part 1 and 2 Harvey Dent's transformation into Two Face is handled with light and dark changes as well as backround effects! The show was so experimental in its treatment of the caped crusader! In FEAT OF CLAY part 1 and 2 Matt Hagen undergoes a tranformation into the growtesque Clayface and persues Batman until Clayface is eletricuted but still escapes capture!

In MAD AS A HATTER The Mad Hatter, voiced by Roddy McDowell want Alice his co worker to go away with him and not Billy but the hatter will not let Billy win and he hynotises everyone but Batman to capture her! When Batman tells him,""Then all you've won is a puppet, a souless little doll"" Then the Hatter gets angry and says, ""You made me do this to her!"" When the hatter corners Batman and Batman throws a baterang at him it missis him and hits the sculpture of a Jabberwocy that falls on the  Hatter and pins him down!

And in DREAMS OF DARKNESS Batman has to face his own hallusinations as the Scarecrow poisons him with his fear gas! Seeing this animation from the 1990s in the 21st century makes me yearn for hand drawn animation again!",1445904000,,2395,4.58411214953271

2059197,5,B00023E894,"When the series first started I was in my early 30's. I would make a point of going to work early so that I could come home in time catch Batman at 4PM. I've never done that with any show before or since. That was a wonderful time for television animation with Pinky and the Brain, the Animaniacs, Ren and Stempy, and Beavis and Butthead. But Batman was the standout - with great stories, fantastic voice acting, good characters and amazing art. It showed that animated cartoons didn't have to be throwaway dreck targeted to kids. It could present serious (PG) story lines with good stories. It was quite a departure from the normal slapstick style of animation of the time.

When I met my (future) wife, she was totally shocked I would adjust my work schedule to come home early just to watch ""cartoons"". I suspect she just chalked it up to yet another eccentricity of mine. It's hard to explain to folks that ""Batman: The Animated Series"" isn't just a ""cartoon"". It's great storytelling from a comic universe that most of us love.

2059231,5,B00023E894,"I have some incredible memories of racing home to watch Batman after school, so I may be a bit biased. However, after college I revisited some favorite shows of mine as a kid. Some held up pretty well (X-Men), others not so much (Spider-Man, SO 90's)...and then there was this show. If anything, it's only gotten better with age. Subtle enough to be enjoyed by kids, but with enough nuance to make an adult really appreciate the themes, musical scores, artwork and voice acting.

Nearly 30 now, I can't help but stare in awe at some of the amazing designs while my inner 6th grader's heart races when I hear the Batman theme play and hear Mark Hamill's Joker cackle. The influence of Burton's films on this show is undeniable, but it still manages to carve out its own (beautiful) identity. The overly-dramatic architecture design and art-deco flair evoke a nostalgic sense of German Expressionism and a time gone-by. At times, I nearly feel like a kid experiencing these episodes once more -which is something truly special.

This show is an absolute MUST have if you enjoy Batman. The only shame is that this show did not last longer, though Batman Beyond directly ties into it (another discussion for another review). I cannot recommend this show more highly.

It was incredibly painful to leave my season 1 set behind in Baltimore with my nephews when I brought it for them to check out this past summer, but I didn't mind (too) much knowing that a new generation would be able to fall in love with this timeless classic that has been nominated numerous times as one of the best cartoons of all time.",1418083200,,1604,4.660777385159011

I especially like the two part stories such as ""The Cat and The Claw"", ""Two Face"" and ""Feat of Clay"". The action sequences and the animation are good but the storylines are even better.

All are excellent, well-written scripts with characters the viewer can care about. The best by far is The Cat and The Claw. This one has Kate Mulgrew as Red Claw, a terrorist that Catwoman and Batman team up to battle. Also a personal favorite is Joker's Favor, which introduces Harley Quinn, a character who has gotten very famous in her own right. Beware the Gray Ghost has an inside joke with Adam West voicing the character of Simon Trent, a washed up actor only remembered for playing the Gray Ghost, a superhero. Another top winner is Dreams in Darkness where Batman ends up as an inmate in Arkham Asylum and The Joker is addressed by his real name. There is so much good stuff here, I cannot summarize it all.

2059253,4,B00023E894,"In 1992 Warner Brothers Animation capitalised on the success of the Tim Burton Batman films with a new animated series which took its cue from those movies in terms of visual design. The result was one of the most acclaimed cartoon series of all time, Batman: The Animated Series. It ran for three years and spawned a number of spin-off films and sequel series, not to mention the entire DC Animated Universe.

The series was immensely successful for three key reasons. The first is its visual design, which moves away from the traditional primary colour aesthetic of cartoons to something much darker. This was achieved by painting light colours on black backgrounds rather than vice versa and setting most of the action at night. The art style also draws heavily from the Burton movies' mixture of art deco and retro design with modern technology. Stylistically, Batman may be one of the coolest and visually engaging series ever made.

The second key to success is the writing. Whilst the show occasionally fumbles with a fairly obvious cops 'n' robbers story or an episode more suited to the 1960s Batman series,  for most of the time the writing is pretty smart. Whilst overt blood or scenes of death are avoided, the show also doesn't hold back on showing the psychological damage the characters have received and even manages to turn certain characters - Mr. Freeze most notably - into tragic figures. This extends to Batman himself, who suffers occasional bouts of trauma resulting from the murder of his parents. One episode imagines a fantasy world in which Bruce Wayne's parents lived and is appropriately tragic. The series also does a good job of hitting the right note of moral ambiguity, such as in Bruce Wayne's friendship with the doomed Harvey Dent and the depiction of Catwoman as both an ally and an enemy.

The third element of success is the voice acting. It's a remarkable feat given competition such as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, but Mark Hamill's Joker is now widely considered definitive for his hitting of just the right note of demented insanity in his portrayal of the character. Kevin Conroy's Batman is also terrific, particularly his ability to adjust his performance so that Wayne and Batman have somewhat different voices and people don't recognise him immediately (an idea that carries on into the Nolan films and Christian Bale's performance). One-off guest stars are also excellent, with Adam West (who played Batman in the 1960s TV series) relishing a chance to give a serious performance as a childhood TV hero of Bruce Wayne's who helped inspire him to become Batman.

Episodes are fast-paced and engaging, action-packed enough to entertain children but with enough funny lines and smart moments of character-building to keep adults engaged. However, the show does suffer from a relaxed attitude to continuity. Aside from a few elements (Harvey Dent appearing several times before turning into Two-Face), the show doesn't have much of a developing story and characters appear and disappear randomly, particularly Robin. The show also mixes in-depth origin stories for some villains with others showing up and Batman apparently having known them for years.

The absence of heavy continuity means it's a lot easier to dip in and enjoy the show without having to pay too much attention to details, but it also means some of the much more complex character development of later animated series is missing.

Batman: The Animated Series is a highly watchable and enjoyable show with or without kids, with some beautiful artwork and terrific writing. The absence of more serialised storytelling means some storylines and characters are not fleshed out as much as might be wished, but overall this is an animated series that has aged very well and is worth checking out.",1400371200,,3808,5.015822784810126

Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker!) give stellar performances as the voice of Batman and the Joker, respectively.

2059261,5,B00023E894,"I HATE the final three seasons of this show sadly, but this aside, Batman: The Animated Series, Volume One is without a doubt the GREATEST INCARNATION OF BATMAN EVER! Be it the original movie's, the perfect Nolan trilogy, or any other animated show we've had before or since, EVERYTHING about this season went right, it was everything we could have ever wanted, wished for, or ever imagined, not only that, but this is one of the greatest animated TV shows ever made! My favorite villain is Two-Face and for the first and only time did his story actually get told starting in brief cameo's as Harvey Dent where it showed him before he was district attorney, then him as district attorney and his relationship with Bruce Wayne/Batman, then his ultimate demise leading him to be Two-Face! :D (Harvey Dent even has a date with Poison Ivy and is on a double date, Bruce Wayne being the other dinner date, Harvey then after falls victim to Poison Ivy in the episode!) that is what this whole season is like, Mr. Freeze got a similar treatment, and like Harvey Dent/Two-Face's, it was perfectly executed! This show was so attentive to detail and cared for and it really shows, it is unbeatable! The ultimate comic book superhero and villains getting the ultimate animated TV show they deserved, long before the great director Christopher Nolan himself once again changed how we saw Batman!

2059274,4,B00023E894,"I was quick to grab this up solely because I feared that I wouldn't get another opportunity to own my favorite action cartoon as a child. I was happy with the packaging and the discs played very well. It sparked up much nostalgia to see Batman they way I remembered him when I was a child. The only little thing that I would like to point out is that there seems to be no particular order in the way that the episodes are on the disc. Other than that, it is an excellent collection. Audio and visual are just as good as when they aired on television years ago. I recommend to anyone thinking about it.",1388016000,,601,4.189655172413793
2059275,4,B00023E894,"Inspired by the 1989 motion picture ""Batman"", which in turn was primarily based on the works of Batman creator Bob Kane and comics legend Frank Miller (""The Dark Knight Returns""), Batman: The Animated Series (which debuted in September 1992) unintentionally became the new standard of animation with its revolutionary visuals and phenomenal storytelling.
DISC 1: Contains episodes ""On Leather Wings,"" ""Christmas with the Joker,"" ""Nothing to Fear,"" ""The Last Laugh,"" ""Pretty Poison,"" ""The Underdwellers,"" and ""P.O.V."" The first episode is the best on this disc, with Batman facing the fearsome Man-Bat. The show really hit the ground running, but the immediate follow-ups are a bit weak. ""P.O.V."" has moments of interest because of its unusual structure, and ""Nothing to Fear"" has a great finale, but the two Joker episodes are particularly poor; the show hadn't quite figured out its style yet. Also on this disc is commentary by Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski for ""On Leather Wings,"" and a two-minute demo they did to sell the look of the series.

DISC 2: Contains episodes ""The Forgotten,"" ""Be a Clown,"" ""Two Face (Parts 1&2),"" ""It's Never Too Late,"" ""I've Got Batman in My Basement,"" and ""Heart of Ice."" The last is one of the most popular episode of the series, introducing the fantastic re-imagining of Mr. Freeze as a tragic figure. ""Two-Face"" is also a superb villain origin story. The other episodes are minor, with a poor Joker and Penguin episode, but ""It's Never Too Late"" is an interesting non-super-villain story. The bonus feature on this disc is a great 18-minute documentary about the series, with interviews with the producers, writers, and some of the actors. There's also audio commentary on ""Heart of Ice"" with Timm, Radomski, and writer Paul Dini.

DISC 3: Contains episodes ""The Cat and the Claw (Parts 1&2),"" ""See No Evil,"" ""Beware of the Gray Ghost,"" ""Prophecy of Doom,"" and ""Feat of Clay (Parts 1&2)."" The show was clearly taking off at this point; only ""Prophecy of Doom"" is a poor episode. ""Beware the Gray Ghost"" brings back Adam West to the Batman series, and is one of the most inspirational of all the episodes. ""Feat of Clay"" contains stunning animation, and ""Cat and Claw"" gives us the wonderful relationship between Batman and Catwoman. The bonus feature is a Batcave tour, basically a few screens of text and some connected montages of images from the show.

DISC 4: Contains episodes ""The Joker's Favor,"" ""Vendetta,"" ""Fear of Victory,"" ""The Clock King,"" ""Appointment in Crime Alley,"" ""Mad as a Hatter,"" and ""Dreams in Darkness."" Two lesser villains, Clock King and Mad Hatter, become the focus of great episodes. ""The Joker's Favor"" is one of the best Joker episodes, and introduces Harley Quinn, who would become one of the show's most popular creations. The two Scarecrow episodes aren't much, however. The bonus feature is a plug for some of the other DC heroes.",1386720000,4,2899,4.9979296066252585
2059276,5,B00023E894,"Batman The Animated Series is one the greatest if not The Greatest TV animated shows of all time.
Well written plots, voice acting, closest to the comics you will ever get. And great animation.

2059277,5,B00023E894,"""The Batman."" He's huge. Ominous. I can't believe that after over 20 years it has so much to offer. The art sometimes gets a little funky and very silly looking, but what can you expect from a publisher (DC) that has characters like The Penguin and Plastic Man in their stables. This is a serious show, however, rather dark. And the general level of animation, especially some of the stock animation like the Bat-mobile roaring out of the Bat-cave and the cartoon's introduction are excellent. And don't worry, despite the silly art on the set's case, you are getting The Batman, not Bat-Cheese. I love it.",1382659200,,606,4.726415094339623

2059279,5,B00023E894,This series was one of my favorites. I'm glad to have the complete series now. I like that they included the later seasons as a part of the whole Batman Animated series instead of making them separate collections.,1381104000,,213,4.631578947368421
2059280,5,B00023E894,"I always regretted not buying the box set when it was available a few years back but I have to say these individual volumes really were nicely done. They also fit perfectly on my bookshelf and blend right in next to my graphic novels.

Please note: Amazon shrink-wraps this item to a piece of cardboard before it goes in the box. This is great for protecting against water, moisture, etc but the shrink-wrapping tends to flatten the corners of the outer sleeve a bit. So if your hoping for ""perfect"" you might do better buying it in person somewhere. You'll definitely pay more though, ($44.99 plus tax at Barnes & Noble).",1377648000,,622,4.603603603603603

2059282,5,B00023E894,This is a great cartoon for kids and adults. This 4 DVD set is great too. It has the first 28 episodes. The special features are few but good. I personally like the commentaries best and wish there were more episodes that had them. My only complaint is the packaging: the paperboard gets worn easily. Especially if you watch it frequently or have kids it could bend or rip.,1376006400,,373,4.420289855072464
2059283,5,B00023E894,"In the wake of Tim Burton's highly successful big-screen ""Batman"" adaptation came another revolution in superhero culture. ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" as birthed from the minds of Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski (""Tiny Toon Adventures""), was a joint effort between Warner Bros. and Fox at continuing to ride the wave of success enjoyed by Burton's landmark effort. Rather than create a simple cash-in that dumbed down the material for its audience (presumed to be children at the time), the creators of the show went in the completely opposite direction, bringing Batman to life in a way that was perhaps more realistic and more faithful to its source material than anything seen beforehand. The resulting effort was perhaps one of the most memorable animated series of the '90s and a version of Batman that fanboys and fair-weather viewers could enjoy one in the same.

Here we have the first 28 episodes of the series, spread across four discs and appropriately dubbed ""Volume One."" While the series hits the ground running with ""On Leather Wings,"" it admittedly staggers a bit before really finding the right tone midway through the series. In early episodes, we follow Bruce Wayne as Batman as he mediates between conflicting mobsters and slums it up amongst the hobos. Some of these early moments find the character wallowing in unintentional and unfortunate camp, indicating perhaps a lack of a faith from the studio (or perhaps the creators themselves) that a full-fledged ""Dark"" Dark Knight would work. Thankfully, things level out with a series of key episodes that elevate the show onto its own plane of existence. Two-part episodes concerning Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face as well as the washed-up actor turned villain for hire, Clayface, give previously unseen weight and dimension to underrated villains. Likewise, ""Heart Of Ice"" introduces Mr. Freeze as a tragic figure for the first time, giving heart to what had previously been seen as a throwaway character. ""Beware The Gray Ghost"" is notorious for bringing the Batman of the '60s into the fray, giving Adam West a meaty-role as an out-of-work and perpetually typecast (as a superhero, of course) actor who is called upon by Batman to solve a mystery. The final episode of the set, ""Dreams In Darkness"" is perhaps the darkest and most intriguing of them all, as Batman finds himself somehow trapped in Arkham Asylum. As the narrative unravels to its conclusion, it becomes apparent that this show is more than just your average Saturday morning fodder.

In spite of a few clunkers (""I've Got Batman In My Basement""), the first 28 episodes of the series are truly magical. Even as the show is finding its tone early on, it's still compelling. With flawless animation presented in a classy film-noir format, you could mute the show and still remain invested in its happenings. This is, of course, setting aside the riveting score by Shirley Walker (adapted from Danny Elfman's work) and the top-notch voice-acting. Kevin Conroy was born to play Batman, and is aided by the likes of Mark Hamill as The Joker, Adrienne Barbeau as Catwoman and the late Roddy McDowall as Mad Hatter. The episodes are presented in their original production order, which may be a bit jarring when you see Robin weave in and out of the picture throughout. Regardless, once the series really gets going, you'll find it hard to turn away. In many ways, this series outdoes any of its cinematic predecessors making for some of the best Batman for your buck. Whether you remember it nostalgically or are just now discovering it for the first time, it holds up. This is a testament to the trail-blazing spirit that nursed this show to become the legend it is now rightfully regarded as. You'd have to be absolutely batty to not appreciate this.",1375142400,,3795,4.974803149606299

2059288,5,B00023E894,"Seeing as how I've talked about this show in a couple previous reviews, it's about time I review the series itself.  But what more can be said?  This is a really good series.  The DCAU is probably my favorite animated series after the Transformers/Marvel tie.  It introduced kids to some dark but well-crafted material & their parents could watch the show with them without throwing up, like my father did.  We still watch this show together & love it, though we might disagree sometimes on whether an episode was good or not.  Here's a graded review of every episode, with synopsizes from Wikipedia, & occasional commentary.

1.  On Leather Wings:  A mysterious bat-like creature terrorizes Gotham City, causing the police force to pursue Batman.  The Dark Knight must find the real perpetrator to clear his name.  The perfect episode to start the series off with.  A

2.  Christmas With the Joker:  After escaping Arkham Asylum on Christmas Eve, The Joker takes over Gotham's airwaves and terrorizes the city for a crime.  He challenges Batman and Robin to find his hidden TV studio and free his hostages -- Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock and Summer Gleason -- before midnight.  Almost any episode with the Joker as the (or a) main villain is perfect, & this one is especially good.  A+

3.  Nothing to Fear:  Batman encounters the Scarecrow and attempts to foil his scheme to burn down Gotham University, but in the process is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear gas and is forced to face his own guilt over the death of his parents.  A+

4.  The Last Laugh:  The Joker covers Gotham City in a cloud of laughing gas and begins plundering the crazed city.  But after Alfred is infected with the toxin, Batman has added incentive to stop the Joker and acquire an antidote from him before all of Gotham dies with a smile.  A+

5.  Pretty Poison:  When District Attorney Harvey Dent collapses after a meal with his fiance Pamela Isley and friend Bruce Wayne, doctors discover that he has been poisoned.  Batman must find the culprit and the antidote before the DA's time runs out.  A

6.  The Underdwellers:  Batman traces a series of bizarre robberies on the streets of Gotham back to a band of homeless children, who have been raised to do the bidding of their master, the Sewer King.  A lot of people hate this episode, including the producers because of executive meddling.  It's not the worst Batman episode, but it could have better.  D

7.  P.O.V.:  A botched police operation results in the suspension of those involved: Officer Wilkes, Officer Montoya and Detective Harvey Bullock.  Confronted by their superiors, each of them is forced to tell their tale of what happened that night.  Better than the last one, but it just wasn't interesting enough.  C

8.  The Forgotten:  While investigating the disappearances of Gotham's homeless in an undercover disguise, Bruce Wayne is kidnapped and imprisoned in a chain gang mining camp, suffering from amnesia.  Alfred must thus track him down, help him escape and free the rest of the prisoners.  B

9.  Be a Clown:  Mayor Hamilton Hill's miserable son, Jordan, becomes even sadder when his father uses his birthday party as a political gathering, and ends up stowing away in the truck of the party clown hired by Hill for the party, whom he doesn't know is actually the Joker in disguise.  It is now up to Batman, whom Mayor Hill distrusts, to rescue the boy before it is too late.  A+

10-11.  Two-Face:  Mobster Rupert Thorne attempts to use Harvey Dent's secret split personality to blackmail him.  But when Dent meets with Thorne at a chemical plant, ""Big Bad Harv"" takes over, and the resulting confrontation leads to an explosion that horribly scars half of Dent's face.  A+

12.  It's Never Too Late:  A mob war between crime bosses Rupert Thorne and Arnold Stromwell is nearing its end, and comes to a climax when Stromwell is set up to be killed in an exploding restaurant by Thorne.  Batman saves him at the last moment, and tries to persuade him to give up his life of crime and help the police bring Thorne down by testifying against him.  A

13.  I've Got Batman In My Basement:  During a fight with Batman over a stolen Faberg egg, the Penguin incapacitates Batman with poison gas.  The Dark Knight is rescued by a teenage amateur detective named Sherman Grant and his friend Roberta, who hide Batman in Sherman's basement long enough for him to recover before the Penguin finds them.  The most famous example of bad episodes focused on kids who we've never seen before & will never see again.  F

14.  Heart of Ice:  Bitter scientist Victor Fries, as Mr. Freeze, attacks several divisions of Gothcorp, each time stealing a piece for a secret weapon he intends to build.  Batman investigates the connections, and discovers that the start of Freeze's vendetta against Gothcorp was a bitter falling out between Fries and Gothcorp's CEO, Ferris Boyle, during which Boyle almost killed Fries (mutating him into Freeze) and presumably killed Fries' terminally ill wife, Nora.  Batman must find a way to bring Boyle to justice before Freeze carries out his revenge.  A fan-favorite episode that is superior in every way to Batman & Robin.  A+

15-16.  The Cat and the Claw:  Batman encounters a new cat burglar calling herself Catwoman, and around the same time, meets a woman named Selina Kyle (as Bruce Wayne), to whom he is visibly attracted.  When Selina runs into trouble with a terrorist group known as The Red Claw, who want the mountain lion sanctuary she was trying to protect, she decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate.  A

17.  See No Evil:  Lloyd ""Eddie"" Ventrix is on the verge of losing his daughter, Kimberly, to his ex-wife, Helen, due to his past as an con artist.  Determined not to lose Kimberly, Ventrix dons a suit, stolen from where he used to work while on parole, which grants the user invisibility but also becomes highly toxic, and poses as Kimberly's imaginary friend, Mojo, while stealing jewellery for her.  Can Batman solve the mystery crimes and stop Ventrix, and at the same time, save his life, despite the fact that he cannot even see him?  B+

18.  Beware the Grey Ghost:  Simon Trent, an actor best known for his past role as ""The Gray Ghost"", is on the verge of bankruptcy thanks to his declining career.  To save himself, he sells off all of his Gray Ghost merchandise. Immediately afterwards, a series of crimes related to the old show begin to occur.  Batman, having himself been inspired partly by the show to become the crimefighter he now is, goes to Trent for help, and they team up to put an end to the crimes.  This episode by itself is great, but Adam West playing the Gray Ghost cinches it.  A+

19.  Prophecy of Doom:  Batman investigates a cult, called the Brotherhood, founded by the ""mystic"" Nostromos after hearing about a number of stories from his colleagues about his ability to predict the future.  Batman finds out that Nostromos is actually a con artist who was rigging near-fatal accidents to gain the confidence of Gotham's upper class citizens.  Can Batman expose this ruse before it's too late?  B

20-21.  Feat of Clay:  Bruce Wayne is framed for the attempted murder of Lucius Fox.  The real perpetrator is an actor and master of disguise named Matt Hagen, who was disfigured in a car accident years ago.  In order to keep his fame, he secretly started working for Roland Daggett, who provides him with a monthly supply of an addictive face cream known as Renuyu (a pun on ""Renew You"") that can temporarily reshape his face back to normal, and who wants to take Wayne Enterprises over for marketing expansion.  For botching the murder, Hagen's supply is cut off, and when he breaks into Daggett's lab for more Renuyu, he pays the price dearly when Daggett's men drench his face in the formula & force him to swallow liters of it to avoid drowning.  It horribly mutates him.  A+

22.  Joker's Favor:  After a man named Charlie Collins accidentally curses at the Joker on the road for bumping him, the Clown Prince of Crime corners him and intimidates him into doing him a ""small favor"".  Two years pass, and the Joker finally decides how to use Charlie: to sneak a bomb into Gotham University, where Commissioner Gordon is to give a speech at an award ceremony.  Charlie, who merely has to open the door, is skeptical at first, but for the sake of his family, he reluctantly decides to obey.  But is the Joker really the type to let someone who insulted him live?  A+

23.  Vendetta:  Detective Bullock is arrested for kidnapping.  Batman, who dislikes Bullock but nevertheless believes him to be a good man, investigates, and discovers the identity of the real criminal: Killer Croc, who harbors a vendetta against Bullock for capturing him once.  Can he clear Bullock's name before it is too late?  C

24.  Fear of Victory:  The Scarecrow invents some kind of fear chemical that is activated by adrenaline.  Then, he uses it to affect the outcome of athletic events.  Whenever a single person becomes agitated, the fear chemical kicks in, turning his excitement to fear.  The Scarecrow bets against the sports stars' teams as part of his criminal scheme to scare up some quick cash and Batman and Robin must foil his plot.  A

25.  The Clock King:  After his company goes bankrupt, Temple Fugate becomes the Clock King.  Fugate sets out to seek his revenge against the man whom he blames for his misfortunes: Mayor Hamilton Hill.  Fugate kidnaps Hill, intending to do away with him to accomplish his revenge.  Batman must stop Fugate from carrying out his revenge and save the mayor's life.  Despite the fact that the Clock King has the worst origin story ever (he was a few minutes late; his whole life was ruined) this was a good episode.  B

26.  Appointment in Crime Alley:  With the help of arsonists, Roland Daggett plans to destroy Crime Alley and use the land to expand his business empire.  But that plan would mean killing the residents or forcing them to abandon their homes.  Now, Batman must foil Daggett's plan and try to prove that he is a criminal.  B+

27.  Mad As a Hatter:  Miserable Wayne Industries scientist Jervis Tetch is unable to pursue the girl he loves, Alice the secretary.  When she splits up from her boyfriend, he makes an advance and develops a fast friendship with her, until her boyfriend reconciles with her and proposes to her.  Enraged, Tetch decides to take matters into his own hands, and dons the mantle of the Mad Hatter, using his mind-control devices to force those who have wronged him all his life to become his mindless slaves.  A

28.  Dreams In Darkness:  Batman is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum after being exposed to Scarecrow's fear inducing gas.  Batman knows that the Scarecrow has escaped for the second time and is planning to poison Gotham's water supply with the same fear inducing gas.  Can Batman bring himself to break the law and escape from Arkham before the Scarecrow brings Gotham to its knees?  A

Everyone should get this series, whether they're Batman fans or not.  Although I like the Marvel shows a tiny bit more, WB's treatment of their shows is superior.  The special features are great, & the packaging is alot more colorful, especially for the Batman ones.  The only bad thing about the package design for this one is the choice of villain for the spine.  This one has the Penguin on it, & Volume 2 has the Joker.  They should have been switched for 2 reasons.  1.  Joker is the arch nemesis, & should have come first.  2.  The Penguin is only in one episode on here, & it's one of the worst episodes ever.  Volume 2 has his best episode, Birds of a Feather.  But other than that it's perfect.",1369958400,2,11720,4.69723865877712
2059289,5,B00023E894,"Forget about the movies. The best film representation of the Caped Crusader is, and will always be, The Animated Series that ran from 1992 up until 1995. This show is stellar, and it not only revolutionized Saturday morning cartoons, but it redefined Batman for a new generation.

Volume One contains some of the best Bat-Stories ever spun. The best telling of Two Face's origin can be found here in a mind blowing two part episode. Neither origins for the character told by Loeb nor Nolan, respectively, can compare to the one that is found here.

The legendary Heart Of Ice episode can be found here as well. This is a very important episode and marks a very significant moment in Batman's history. One of his less beloved villains became an overnight fan favorite. He went from unsympathetic to incredibly heartbreaking. This character was Mr. Freeze. The episode actually went on to not only land the show its very first Emmy award, but it also affected the comic book universe. Many writers adopted the new Freeze origin that Heart Of Ice proposed.

But Heart Of Ice wasn't the last time that the Animated Series would alter and inspire the comic book universe. In one of the best episodes from Volume One, an episode called Joker's Favor, another important event would take place. Although she had but a handful of lines, Harley Quinn made her first appearance. She would go on to not only change the comic book universe but become a long-lasting part of pop culture. An inspired creation on behalf of Paul Dini, a sensation was born.

My favorite episode contained within the first volume may seem slightly controversial to some, but Mad As A Hatter is an exceptional show. Mad As A Hatter tells the story of Jervis Tetch, the man who will become the Mad Hatter. I thought this episode was so well-done, I have watched it several times. It is a true joy to see the Mad Hatter handled with such care. The best Mad Hatter story ever told, and it will make you a believer of him. A loving portrait of a madman. The show was very good at redeeming lesser liked and lesser known villains. They had already done so with Mr. Freeze by the time they would make the Mad Hatter a legitimate psychopathic threat. They would do it again with Scarface and the Ventriloquist, but I'm getting ahead of myself now.

It's really good to catch this show if you never have because it carries the darker nature of Batman (with a 40's feel to it), the voice actors are very solid and the stories are engrossing. There is not much for extras/bonus except for a short about the pilot episode (which was interesting and explains the show opening), a retrospective (pretty standard stuff) and a tour of the Batcave.

Now when I rewatch it, I just love it more and more! The cool thing about this show is it can be viewd by anyone from child to adult, it stays classic and that's whats special about it.

This show was so different than the other cartoons, it was extremely dark for a show that was intended for children. But I like it when it is dark haha. This volume has a lot of great epsidoes. They all depict Batman as a dark and omnious figure, but he shows compassion even to his enemies. I love the drama and the emotion in the scenes, it really makes each episodes speacial. The animation is also top notch especially the Clay Face origin episodes.

This volume has plenty of great espidoes, here's some of my favorite. On Leather Wings- A giant Bat terrorizes Gotham lab's, the action is top notch and you see a lot of Batman's toys.  :) It's Never To Late- Two mob bosses fight eachother for control of the drug trade in Gotham city, this epsidoes has a lot of emotion which leads to a great episode, I've got Batman in the basement-Two kids save Batman by hiding him in the basesment away from Penguin, great and funny episode.

The picture is good, not blu ray, but for a 20 year old cartoon it's pretty good. Sound is decent as well. I've noticed that a few episodes suffer from the speech is too quiet and action sounds/music is too loud when set at a normal volume. Am I complaining? No, It's not that much of a problem that I regret spending money on these. Just watch them with the volume control nearby.

As far as extras, I can't really comment. I haven't gotten into them. Usually I don't  bother with extras on TV show sets, especially cartoons. They're usually a bunch of rough sketches set to an explanation from the director or voice acting that was never used. Not my cup of tea.

As much as I like The Dark Knight and even the comics, I will always like The Animated Series best.  The voice-acting, especially Mark Hamill as the Joker, makes even the most outrageously outsized characters believable.  I cannot think of any other show on when I was a child that had two-part episodes that had me worrying about the characters until the next episode aired.  When I watch this as an adult, I am still drawn in by the stories and the expressionist setting of Gotham City and the character design and the voices.

2059320,5,B00023E894,"Growing up in the late 80s and early 90s Batman: The Animated Series (TAS) played a huge role on in my childhood. Batman TAS was the Batman I grew up with. I remember trying to catch every espisode of this cartoon, that I could. Batman TAS was a revolutionary carton and broke many barriers for its time, it's dark tone and atmosphere, and the fact that guns actually shot bullets (not laser beams) set this cartoon apart from most of the cartoons of this era, and the cartoons I grew up with. The acting and storywriting set is apart from all others as well. Watching these cartoons 15-20 years after seeing them for the first time, it amazes me how fresh and entertaining they are, even for the adult viewer.

This collection contains a whopping 28 episodes of this awesome series on four discs. A great bang for your buck in my opinion. And the appealing packaging will make a great ddition to any Batman collection display.

Being older now and a family man, I love having the opportunity of sharing some of my fondest childhood memories, and my favourite hero, with my kids. For the die-hard Batman enthusiast, or fanboy who wants to share his passion with a younger generation, this will not dissapoint and is a great buy.",1353456000,,1228,4.577272727272727

2059322,5,B00023E894,"I love Batman The Animated Series. This is one of the best tv shows based on Batman ever created, and one of the best animated series ever created. This volume was a great start for the series, and of course Batman is the start of the DCAU (DC Animated Universe). A few great episodes from this volume are the first episode titled ""On Leather Wings"". This episode features the villain Man-Bat, as Batman must find out who Man-Bat is to stop him, and to clear his name as Batman is being framed for these crimes. Another great episode is the Two-part episode Two-Face, as it introduces Harvey Dent becoming the villain Two-Face. I really like how they portray Two-Face in this tv series as more of a tragic villain than just a complete psycopath. I mean Two-Face does have a problem with flipping a coin to decide what he should do, but nonetheless, Two-Face was portrayed beautifully. Anyways, another great episode is the Christmas with the Joker episode, which turns out to be one of my personal favorites. Mostly because it is Christmas themed, and this is the episode that introduced ""Jingle Bells, Batman Smells, Robin Layed an Egg. The Batmobile Lost a Wheel, and the Joker got away"" which is even later referenced by The Flash in the Justice League Unlimited Episode ""Panic in the Sky"". Another two-part episode in this volume is the ""Feat of Clay"" two-parter. This introduces Matt Hagen becoming the villain Clayface, who after being exposed to too much of this special cream, he then gains the ability to shapeshift into anyone he wishes to at will. One of the greatest moments in this volume is in the episode ""Nothing to Fear"", when Batman is on the Scarecrow's Blimp, and thinks he is seeing a vision of his father telling him he is a failure, he utters the great line ""I am Vengeance. I am the Night. I AM BATMAN!"" Another great thing about this series is that it introduces a few new characters not previously shown in DC Comics. For instance, in the episode ""The Joker's Favor"", it introduces the character Harley Quinn, the Joker's partner in crime and girlfriend. After that, Harley Quinn was eventually adapted into the comics. But one of my favorite moments in this Volume is from the episode ""The Gray Ghost"" as this episode features Adam West voicing ""The Gray Ghost"" in this episode. I mean afterall, Adam West was a great actor for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1960s. This is how the episodes look on the discs:
DISC 1
On Leather Wings
Christmas with the Joker
Nothing to Fear
The Last Laugh
Pretty Poison
The Underdwellers
P.O.V.
DISC 2
Forgotten
Be A Clown
Two-Face Part 1

Feat of Clay Part 1
Feat of Clay Part 2
DISC 4
The Joker's Favor
Vendetta
Fear of Victory
The Clock King
Appointment in Crime Alley
Mad as a Hatter
Dreams in Darkness
Don't forget, this does also feature a few special features, such as ""Batman, the Legacy Continues"" which a retrospective featurette. It also includes an audio commentary on the episodes ""On Leather Wings"" and ""Heart of Ice"", which is the episode that earned the series it's first Emmy Award. It also includes a Tour of the Batcave featurette, and The Dark Knight's first night pilot promo, which is something Bruce Timm created, but unfortunately it doesn't have it's original audio track, so they instead just used the theme from the series in the promo. Plus another thing is, the theme was created by Danny Elfman, who also created the score for Batman and Batman Returns. So all in all, if you're a fan of Batman, then I would definitely recommend getting this DVD set along with the other volumes.",1351209600,,3773,4.591111111111111
2059323,5,B00023E894,My 40 year old daughter was ecstatic when she opened her gift. She has wanted this for YEARS! Sellers want reviews - so do buyers; at least I do.,1350950400,,145,4.0344827586206895
2059324,5,B00023E894,"I've always liked this series.  I was 13 years old when it started airing in the afternoons and I used to watch it after school.  Twenty years later, I find the episodes to be just as enjoyable as they were in 1992.

The plot and dialog of these episodes are intelligent and mature, though not so mature that little kids won't enjoy them.  They'll like seeing Batman and (occasionally) Robin out there fighting the bad guys.  For older kids and adults, the stories are engrossing and they don't seem stupid or anything because of the intelligent writing.  There's nothing corny or stupid, like there is with a lot of kids' cartoons.  The characters are all well written and have great voice actors.

Another thing that makes this series a standout is the artwork.  It's an interesting ""what if"" kind of world.  What if the World's Fair version of the future had come true and Art Deco had never gone out of style?  Thus, they give us a 1990s world but with that classic Art Deco style.  It's visually appealing and different than what was being done on other cartoon series.  Plus, they stared with dark backgrounds and added the light, which gives the entire series a darker, more shadowy look, which is perfect for Batman.

These first 28 episodes are the first 28 in production order.  They feature many great stories, including showing origin stories for Man Bat, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, The Mad Hatter and Clayface.  Also, the Joker and Penguin appear in various episodes, though no origin story is given for them.  Catwoman also shows up in these early episodes, though she doesn't really require an ""origin"" story because she's a cat burglar, as she was in the comics.  They've put their own spin on those origins, as they have many of the elements for the series.  Also, they were the first to do some things that were so popular that they were incorporated into DC Comics, such as the creation of the Joker's female sidekick Harley Quinn and the decision to make Mr. Freeze more of a tragic character by giving him a sick wife who was his motivation to do everything and the eventual cause of his condition.  They also decided to make Robin older.  (not a new concept, but noteworthy)  He's in college, which is established early, and unable to work with Batman as often.  This also makes the character more mature and enjoyable.  Pus, they modeled his costume off of the Tim Drake Robin outfit, rather than the horrible shirt, vest, underwear and elf shoes.  Though, he is Dick Grayson, not Tim Drake.  He appears in the second episode and only one or two more in this collection.",1349654400,,2600,4.65934065934066

2059329,5,B00023E894,"Thinking of this show as just a 'toon does it a disservice.  Like it's title indicates, it is an ""animated series,"" a show like any other dramatic presentation, as others have critically acclaimed, has wonderful production values, including writing, directing, style, scoring, and casting.

The show has awards and nominations befitting the respect that it has earned from fans and critics alike.

Volume One of the series features some of the most memorable episodes, which include ""Cat and the Claw,"" ""Two-Face,"" and ""Feat of Clay,"" the latter showcasing top-notch animation, and the brilliant ""Heart of Ice.""

One of the show's real pluses is the use of real actors, many familiar in name and voice, to add life the characters.  Kevin Conroy is the definitive ""Bat-voice"" and it's no wonder that he has done the character for twenty years.  Other regulars include Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon and Loren Lester, occasionally popping up as Robin.

Watching the first episodes, though the packaging doesn't have them in their original order, viewers will note a different ""Alfred.""  Clive Revell assayed the role but was replaced by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., a wise move on the part of the producers.  Zimbalist took the role and ""patented"" it as Conroy did the Dark Knight.

Mark Hamill (The Joker), Michael Ansara (Mr. Freeze), the late John Vernon (Rupert Thorne), Ed Asner (Roland Daggett), Adrienne Barbeau (Catwoman/Selena Kyle), John Glover (The Riddler), Richard Moll (Two-Face/Harvey Dent), Ron Perlman (Clayface/Matt Hagen), the late Brock Peters (Lucius Fox), Paul Williams (The Penguin), Kate Mulgrew (Red Claw), Diane Pershing (Poison Ivy/Pamela Isley)and Arlene Sorkin (the wonderfully ditzy Harley Quinn) are just some of the actors that add class to the show.

A fitting homage to the 60's campy ""Batman"" series is the appearance of Adam West in ""Beware of the Gray Ghost.""

Kudos must also be given to the series chief composer, the late Shirley Walker.  Her scoring, along with the work of others, mixes appropriate action cues and lighter ones.

Volume One is a good introduction to the series and for the uninitiated, it will make them savor for the remaining volumes in the collection.",1346198400,,2209,5.185915492957746

2059331,5,B00023E894,"I was very excited when WB decided to release this hit series on DVD when I was in college a few years back.  I wasn't very surprised when a tun of my friends started snapping this title up along with the following volumes.  One of the best things about this series is that it is enjoyable for people of all ages.  Batman TAS was definetly a cut above most of the other cartoons of the early 90s.

  This isn't the campy Batman of the 60s with that silly themesong.  This is the definitive Batman for most.  And Kevin Conroy did an amazing job voicing this character.  He had a distinct voice he would use for both Batman and Bruce Wane.  It is certainly my favorite interpretation of the character.

  I wasn't able to read comics when I was a kid because I was born blind.  So I take great pride in telling all the fans I meet that this baby was pretty much my comic book collection.  I would tape scores of episodes on VHS whenever I got the chance.  And it is wonderful to own all 109 episodes.  Yeah, I count The New Batman Adventures(vol 4) among the hit episodes.  So what if the animation is different.  The stories were just as thrilling and that's all that matters to me.  Newcomers to this series won't want to stop after volume 1 since the others are just as fantastic.  I hope kids of the early 21st century will happen upon the DC Animated Universe, starting with Batman here.  This set is going for $20 as I write this, so you're looking at a nice bargain, reader.  Well that sort of depends on when you're reading this.  Point is, just buy it already.  It's among the best cartoons ever created.

  You might also want to give Superman: The Animated Series from the DC Comics Classics Collection a chance, along with Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, and Batman Beyond.

I recall watching the first Mr. Freeze episode and thinking ""This is going to be a great show to watch"" and then never managed to see it again! Finally, I purchased the First Season DVD set and got to see what I had missed all these years. The writing is well done, the animation slick, and a show that is faithful to the comic book history is something I just can't argue with. As much as the Filmation and Hanna-Barbera shows from the 60s (still waiting for Filmation to release the 1968 Saturday morning run) to the 80s were enjoyable, they were simple fun, but the 90s gave Batman fans more serious storylines to get into.

2059341,5,B00023E894,"I randomly stumbled upon one of the episodes from this animated series while browsing the internet [in all honesty, it was right after beating Arkham City ;)].  I remember loving it to death when I was a kid growing up in the 90s, so I started to watch it - I figured, o what the heck, a little nostalgia never hurt anyone...and boy, I thought I loved it as a kid?  This stuff is amazing!

The story-writing and depth to this series is astounding!  I love these episodes just as much as when I was a kid - if not more!  I bought this set after watching a few online videos, and it has me hooked :)  Every episode is astounding - not only visually, but with their story lines and character development.  It's pure genius that they were able to put so much emotional depth into such a relatively short period of air-time.  It's unabashedly dark at times, and yet, unabashedly traditional ""Batman"" at others.  I get really stoked watching each episode - especially with the fact that they never reveal the villain right away, so in the first minute or so, you're trying to figure out which villain it is, and then you're all like - o snap, it's Poison Ivy! ;)  Or its some random villain you've never heard of, but is still awesome nonetheless (the Mad Hatter?  That guy is so freaking creepy...particularly with me as girl! lol)

If you're considering buying this, totally do it.  And while you're at it, get the second volume too to get free shipping on SuperSavers or whatever it is that Amazon has going.  You definitely won't regret it :)  Then you won't be all upset when you reach the end, because then you can just move to volume two like I did!  This is a FANTASTIC buy that gives you hours of awesome nostalgic and good old-fashioned entertainment.  And don't be surprised if you watch an episode a day - or more - they're just that freaking good - plus, its way better than anything on tv anyways ;)",1327190400,2,1907,4.402857142857143

2059344,5,B00023E894,"Since 1939, Batman has became one of the most successful superheros of all time with his debut for DC Comics after Superman had success. There has been many comics and even some film versions of him over the years including a successful TV show in 1966 but in 1989, Tim Burton's movie became a success as it brought Batman out of the dark alley into the big screen. In 1992 after Batman Returns was successful, Fox made a groundbreaking animated series that earned critical acclaim and skyrocketed ratings as it became Fox's most successful animated series yet as it ran from 92 till 98 when in 97 it moved to WB then spun some spin-off series and Justice League. Bruce Timm and Paul Dini who are two creative animated geniuses decided to make an animated show out of the Dark Knight himself and has made the definitive adaptation of the caped crusader on the small screen. Kevin Conroy provided to be the voice of Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne as he proves to be the best Batman ever portrayed despite being a voice-over as there has been guest voices on the show over the years like Andrienne Barbeau (The Fog, Creepshow, Swamp Thing, Escape from New York etc.) as Catwoman/Selena Kyle, Mark Hamil as Joker, Richard Moll (Nightcourt and House 1986) as Two-Face/Harvey Dent and many more plus nice crisp animation that feels influenced by both Fleschier's Superman cartoons and Japanimation like Akira. The show came around prime time on FOX and i was 11 years old when it first aired and i loved it, it became my fave animated series since as it appealed to all ages from kids, teens and adults because of it's dark nature, intelligent storytelling, likable characters, quality character development, excellent writing and action packed stories.

Disc 1 starts off with ""On Leather wings"" which our hero deals with a mutant half-man/half-bat creature and most find out who is behind this monstrosity that has been terrorizing Gotham City. Next ""Christmas with The Joker"" has our giggling nemesis The Joker who decides to make Christmas Eve his own when he takes over a TV station as he makes his own ghastly Christmas special where he kidnaps 3 people for only Batman and Robin can save Christmas eve. ""Nothing to Fear"" deals with the Scarecrow who steals the money from the bank as he uses his hallucination fear gas to make people terrified yet Batman has became affected by it as he imagines his father telling him he has failed yet needs to face his fear, next we have ""The Last Laugh"" (One of my personal faves) where Joker pulls off the biggest April Fool's Day prank in Gotham history where he uses a garbage heap boat with a gas to make people into laughing lunatics. ""Preety Poison"" offers the debut of gorgeous villaness Poison Ivy where she is a plant-obsessed lady who decides to poison Harvey Dent (Richard Moll) on a date and deals with Batman to find an antiode. ""The Underdwellers"" has a mean spirited sewer livin' criminal who has kidnapped children as he uses them as slaves in the night to rob people and finally ""P.O.V"" has how the police including Gordon met Batman yet don't believe in him at first until now.

Disc 2 has ""Forgotten"" (one of my faves) where Bruce disguises himself as a homeless man after finding out about missing people who needed jobs and missing homeless people, as he ends up in a slavery camp owned by a greedy overweight scum bucket that wants gold. ""Be a Clown"" is a nice story about Mayor Hill's son who runs away from his birthday party as he joins up with the Joker but can Batman save him? next is ""Two-Face 1 & 2"" which is a 2 part episode that is epic about district attorney Harvey Dent who has a case of schizophrenia but when an accident blows away half of his face and body, he becomes disfigured on his other side as he unleashes his other personality. ""It's Never Too Late"" has Batman interfering with two rival gangs as he tries to convince the oldest of the two bosses to change his ways, ""I've got Batman in my Basement"" has two kids who take Batman to their house after Penguin (Voiced by Paul Williams) attacked him and goes after the kids with Bats, finally ""Heart of Ice"" has the debut of Mr. Freeze who seeks a cure for his preserved frozen wife's disease.

Disc 3 starts with ""Cat and The Claw"" where it features Catwoman/Selena Kyle's debut as she is a cat burglar who wants to shut down a corporation that is near an area where wildcats are as she seeks to fight them and battles with Batman against a sexy villain named RedClaw. ""See No Evil"" has a creep who turns invisible thanks to a suit to rob places and wants to see her daughter yet he can't because he is a bad man, then we have ""Beware of the Grey Ghost"" where there has been mad bombings in Gotham which seems to mimic some episodes of a classic TV show called ""Grey Ghost"" that Bruce remembers and is added by the star of Ghost Ghost (voiced by Adam West) to find this mad bomber. ""Prophecy of Doom"" deals with a psychic leader who has a cult that believes in him when he is actually a fraud and finally my fave episode which is a two-parter called ""Feat of Clay 1 & 2"" has a struggling movie actor named Matt Hagen (Voiced by Ron Perlman) who was disfigured in an accident yet a corporation owner named Roland Dagget (Ed Asner) decides to give him a special facial cream that can smooth away wrinkles, reshape imperfections and remake literally his face however he chooses. However when he breaks in for more that stuff, he gets more than he bargained for because Dagget's men gives him an overdose by spilling the stuff on him yet transforms Hagen into a monstrous mount of clay that can shapeshift his appearance and can even forms clothes of his skin for he seeks revenge.

Disc 4 begins with ""Joker's Favor"" (Best Joker episode ever) which features the debut of lovely Harley Quinn and has the title villain as a guy who does a deal with a family man to do some bad things for him including to get rid of Batman. ""Vendetta"" has a half-man half-Crocodile mutant being named Killer Croc who seeks vengeance for those that shunned him, ""Fear of Victory"" has Batman and Robin going after Scarecrow who has been using his toxin yet again to cause fear and even Robin's friend has been affected by it. ""Appointment in Crime Alley"" has a former glorious street in Gotham that is about to be demolished by a corporation lead by Roland Dagget. Next we have ""Mad as Hatter"" where a scientist named Jervis (Voiced by Roddy Mcdowell) seeks the heart of a lovely girl and becomes a mind-controlling villain based off the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland and finally ""Dreams in Darkness"" has the return of Scarecrow and Batman being affected by his fear toxin as he is being held in contempt in Arkham.

2059347,5,B00023E894,"What else can be said about Batman: The Animated Series?  This particular DVD set is Volume One, and is the best.  This animated cartoon series from the early to mid 1990s is a quality cartoon series, to say the least.  The episodes are well written and have a lot of depth to them, even psychological depth.  The episodes are very much on the dark side.  The series portrays the Batman character accurately.  This series is suited for kids as well as adults, very much like the Batman TV series on ABC Television was, which ran from 1966-68.  You can see the heavy influence of the Tim Burton Batman movies, Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) in this animated series.  One of the famous people involved in this series is Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from Star Wars episodes IV, V, and VI), who provides the voice of The Joker.  Many people feel he's the best Joker of all time, even though he's a voice actor.  I'll leave that for you to decide.  The Harley Quinn character, who is The Joker's assistant, was invented for this series.  She has become an extremely popular, even iconic character over the last 19 years.

All in all, this is a great series that be can enjoyed by kids and adults alike.  I highly recommend it.",1312848000,,1229,4.527272727272727

2059350,5,B00023E894,"FINALLY this series is on DVD & FINALLY I have it! IMO, they released it on dvd too late since now, blu-ray's are the thing & the quality would be much better than on dvd. However, not everyone has a blu-ray player so for those that don't (I''m one of them for now), it's good that it's on dvd.

You MUST own this series & you MUST start with Vol. 1. It has the best episodes overall & it worth multiple viewings.

On Leather Wings: It's a great start for the first episode. However, I wish they started with Batman's origin. I know it's been seen. I know we all know how he became Batman. By the way this series was written & animated, I'd love to see their take on it. This has the long Batmobile intro, Batman talking as Bruce while in the costume which is funny.

Christmas with the Joker: GREAT Joker episode.

Nothing to Fear: AWESOME Scarecrow episode. This episode is famous for Kevin Conroy's all too famous Batman line.

The Last Laugh: Another Joker episode. Mark Hamill kills me as The Joker. Great episode here.

Pretty Poison: Poison Ivy's first episode. And what a debut.

The Underdwellers: No known villain from the Batman Universe here. Just a man named the Sewer King for obvious reasons who makes children who I think are homeless to work for him - get him food & such. He punishes a kid for opening his mouth.

P.O.V.: This is one of those episodes you see in a tv series where the entire episode takes place on something that happened in the past & someone lived to tell the story. Here, 3 cops tell a story of a crime & Batman saved them.

The Forgotten: Bruce gets amnesia by going undercover to find out what happened to missing individuals. It takes him time to remember who he is but eventually does of course. Till he does, he spends the episode working for a Fat guy (who is not named) who just likes to eat & watch men do all the work. This is a funny episode when Alfred flies the Bat-Plane lol!!! Worth watching for that if nothing else!!!

Be a Clown: It's Jordan Hill's birthday. He's the son of Mayor Hill. The Joker, disguised as the clown who was supposed to perform for Jordan, arrives to plant a bomb in the birthday cake.

Two-Face Part 1: D.A. This is one of the best 2 part episodes of the series (all multiple part episodes are great). Here, we slowly see Harvey Dent's descent & becoming the villain known as Two Face who uses a coin to make decisions. In this episode, it's basically Harvey vs Big Bad Harv.

Two-Face Part 2: In this episode, he is now Two Face & goes after Thorne. Batman of course gets involved.

It's Never Too Late: Batman decides to help a mob lord named Arnold Stromwell stop Thorne. Gotta hand it to Batman. He never gave up on the mob lord even though he was given plenty of opportunities to.

I've Got Batman in My Basement: Not my favorite episode. Batman was shown to be vulnerable here. Vulnerable to the point where he has to be saved by kids who are junior detectives, who ride the Batmobile. Here, it seemed that the kids were stronger than Batman himself as they did more to The Penguin & were able to thwart him long enough till Batman, who was gassed, could be back to normal to stop him. It's still a good episode though.

Heart of Ice: This episode won an award. It has to be one of the more famous & well remembered/known episode.

Cat and Claw Part 1: Catwoman's first episode. Also the first appearance of a villain, a female terrorist named Red Claw. And appropriately enough, he has a tattoo of a red claw.

Cat and Claw Part 2: Red Claw is tracked down by Batman & Catwoman.

See No Evil: One of my favorite episodes. An underrated one. The last part you see before it goes to the end credits is iconic alone but with the music, it makes it that much more iconic.

Beware of the Gray Ghost: The Grey Ghost, voiced by Adam West if the 1960's Batman tv series fame, is a masked hero Bruce Wayne grew up watching on tv. The actor who portrayed the Grey Ghost is Simon Trent. He helps Batman track down a villain from the tv show named The Mad Bomber, who Grey Ghost sold his merchandise to!

Prophecy of Doom: Not really the greatest.

Feat of Clay Part 1: GREAT 2 partner. The actor, Hagen becomes Clayface.

Feat of Clay Part 2: Clayface is a villain now. Batman tries to stop him.

Joker's Favor: a STRONG FAVORITE of mine. The Title Card music is quite funny lol. The Joker tracks down ""an old friend"" to do him a favor. The man, Charles cusses Joker on the freeway but changed his name and everything. But to no avail as Joker found him anyway.

Vendetta: Debut of Killer Croc, a former professional wrestler. His target: Bullock.

Fear of Victory: The Scarecrow puts fear in sports athletes in a clever way. B&R must stop him. But Robin is also affected by the fear that his college roommate also suffers.

The Clock King: A man who is literally obsessed with time targets Mayor Hill for making him late for a court meeting by telling him to get forget about his schedule for one day.

Appointment in Crime Alley: Daggett wants to get rid of Crime Alley.

Mad As a Hatter: I can sort of relate to this. And I emphasize the words SORT OF. A man named Jarvis who is obsessed with Alice In Wonderland does everything he can do to get the girl he wishes to be with. I can relate to that. But as I said, sort of because not to the degree Jarvis goes to. He later becomes The Mad Hatter.

Dreams in Darkness: Batman is locked up in Arkham for suffering violent visions due to the fear toxin Scarecrow has given him. Batman must prove that he is not hallucinating in order to get free before it's too late.

Kevin Conroy is the best Batman Besides Christian Bale and the comics. The villains are so great in this Joker voiced by Luke Skywalker himself Mark Hamill. Is My favorite Joker Besides Heath Ledger and comics. Two-Face is great, and other villains such as poison ivy, Man-Bat , Mr. Freeze, Clayface, Catwoman who i don't really think is villian, Harley Quinn Who Was created in this show by Paul Dini and later came in play in the comics make appearances in this. The animation is amazing you don't get cartoons like this anymore. The Bests episode in my opinion are the scarecrow ones especially Dreams in Darkness, The Joker Ones are incredible I Think My favorite one is The Last Laugh and Jokers Favor. Two face two parter is good. Heart Of Ice is one of the best Batman stories ever told. The Stories and action is Sweet. The Music By Shirley Walker is spot on with some Danny Elfman in there.

2059355,5,B00023E894,"There are so many levels that Batman: The Animated Series works on that it is difficult if not impossible to sum them up in any review.  However, I would like to try.  First, the show gave Batman an aesthetic that was at once pleasing to children and to adults.  Gotham City is a dark and dirty urban distopia not unlike Tim Burton's noir-ish portrayal of the Dark Knight's home, albeit in the animated series it is trimmed up into a classy art deco design.  As is well known, the series animators were inspired by Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons, which are themselves classic.  Their appreciation of older animation shows through and yet at no point dominates Batman: The Animated Series.  Instead, watching these cartoons is like watching a whole tradition come to life.  We see Burton's films, the 1930s early backdrop, a modern Gotham, art deco designs, Max Fleischer's Superman work.  For some episodes, this offers an incredible amount of charm, particularly the episode 'Beware the Gray Ghost' which has Bruce Wayne/Batman teaming up with his childhood hero to stop the Mad Bomber.  Every time I watch that episode, I am reminded of my own childhood in the best of ways, but it is the animation that ultimately pulls a very fine story together.  The series deserved its many awards for fine animation.

However, there is something else that needs to be touched upon: the story lines are simply brilliant.  Although this began as a kid's cartoon, it brought with it an immensely complex and compelling level of psychological depth.  It is not too much to say that Dini, Timm, and company effectively raised a number of existentially big questions in the series, ranging from the nature of friForendship, the trauma of memory, betrayal, jealousy, loss, and above all justice and the possibility of redemption.  I think that Batman: The Animated Series is not far removed from a form of moral pedagogy.  I treasure this series; my girlfriend and I have watched its many episodes many times and, above all, I look forward to sharing it someday with my own children.  I do believe that this is the finest compliment that I can give it.",1298073600,3,2139,4.835164835164835
2059356,5,B00023E894,"This is without a doubt the REAL vision of Batman! We must give thanks to Frank Miller and the Tim Burton movie for inspiring this perfect vision and concept of my favorite superhero. Everybody knows that what makes this series so cool is that it's is SOOO DARK and ACTION-PACKED with great voice acting, character desing and animation. Can the Batman fans could ask for more than this???

I don't think that Batman had a better show than this. As far as I remember, the 40's series was weak but interesting, the 60's series was good but SOOOO CHEESY!, the 70's animated series was THE WORST! I mean... they even added a magic elf to the Bat-Team! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??!!
Also, after this show came Batman Beyond and other weird Batman cartoons. I never watched Batman Beyond because Batman didn't even looked like Batman, he looked more like Catwoman or something. The other cartoons that came after this one were not so interesting and they didn't had the same vision.

This dvd set loads TONS OF GREAT episodes!
All the Joker episodes are SUPERB! (it's a shame that Harley only appears in ""The Joker's Favor"").
The Scarecrow episodes are CREEPY but ""Fear of Victory"" is pretty weak.
The MR. Freeze episode is COOL.
The Poison Ivy episode is GOOD.
The two-part episodes of Catwoman are ACTION-PACKED!
The two-part episodes of Clayface are AWESOME but a little weak in the first part.
The two-part episodes of Two-Face are interesting but a little weak on action.
Hard to say, but the Penguin episode is pretty weak.
The non-popular villians episodes are pretty good but the best episodes are ""The Underdwellers"" and ""On Leather Wings"".
The rest of the episodes are just good.

The special features are great! There are three languages (spanish for me), commentaries on some episodes, interviews with the producer, animators, ect. and the original 5 minutes pilot that made this cartoon sooo unique.

P.S: Sorry, there are no Riddler episodes. :(",1296604800,,1951,4.84984984984985
2059357,5,B00023E894,"The opening scene in itself was just astounding, and that was just the first minute of the show! Who doesn't remember this gem? This was my favorite childhood cartoon, ever. And for many a good reason. This show raised the bar so high for animation few if any TV series have even come close to it. Brought elegantly to life by Alan Burnett and Bruce Timm, this show defined all that Batman is, as well as rejuvenating many lost characters like the Clock King and Mad Hatter. The beauty of it all is the intricate story lines, never failing to deliver psychological an involving sequences. The animation was just top notch, even by today's standards. Plus you've got to love the dark color pallet, which only added to the atmosphere.

The creators had a very distinct vision of The Dark Knight, albeit probably a tad inspired by Tim Burton's films, but nonetheless they added their own elements to it, as well as extended the world of Gotham City like eager fans like myself wanted to see so badly. I could not review this without giving praise to Kevin Conroy, Bob Hasting, Loren Lester, and especially Mark Hamil and Ron Perlman. The voice work beats the hell out of many TV shows today easily Shirley Walker delivers a thrilling score for each episode , giving this series the dramatic depth I and millions of others fell in love with.",1295481600,,1337,4.617647058823529
2059358,5,B00023E894,"This show is so incredibly good that its a shame that we don't see more of it today. By the way, pay no attention the editorial review that Amazon has listed under the product listings. The guy doing his review knows nothing about animation, as he thinks that it is very easy. He states that"" Ironically, Batman: The Animated Series looks better in stills than it does in motion. The artists fail to stylize the movements of the characters to match the dramatic settings, as Genndy Tartakovsky and his crew did in Samurai Jack."" This guy fails to realize that Samurai Jack came out in the early 2000's and not the early 90's...technology had improved in between those times. Making Batman was an old school creation at its finest. He also states,""Producers Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski recount the genesis of the series, and show their mini-pilot, which is more violent and more fully animated. If the complete episodes had matched the pilot, the series would have been much more exciting."" Again he fails to know anything. If the entire series could match that small piece of animation, then it would have been very costly. That is why cartoon introductions(which are short like the extra he mentions) and movies, have more fluent animation than normally seen. They have bigger budgets, plain and simple. Look I would rather read a review of of a fan than of some critic who barley takes in everything that this series has to offer, so which would you choose?",1293408000,2,1460,4.751968503937008

2059360,5,B00023E894,"It almost seems a simple premise--that with Tim Burton's vision of Batman having reenergized the character in the early 1990s that Warner Brothers' Animation would task Bruce Timm to create a cartoon to take advantage of the popularity.
But we didn't expect that Timm and his core group--Paul Dini, James Tucker, and Andrea Romano--would create a work that is on the short list of The Best Animated Series Ever.  Moreover, it could certainly be argued that B:TAS is one of the best television works of the 1990s.
  In many ways, B:TAS is a reminder of the early days of TV dramas, where half-hour shows delivered drama and action in roughly 24 minutes.  But it stood alone for wiping the floor with the 1960s live-action series, the Filmation animated cells, and the Hanna-Barbera Superfriends' Batman.  For the fanboys, this was The Batman we have wanted--the darker, grittier Batman that Neal Adams had brought back into play in 1970; in the ominous, stark Gotham City.  Nothing perhaps made that point more apparent than that legendary opening--with the Danny Elfman theme playing; the WB logo morphing into the GCPD zeppelin, the bank robbers, the Batmobile, the robbers running away from the police but into the Dark Knight, and the final clap of thunder/bolt of lightning.
  It's great storytelling, where we are made to understand the backstories of many of the members of the Rogue's Gallery.  It even was responsible for a character created in the series becoming part of the Batman continuity--the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn.  Plus, it was really the animated series that brought forward the idea that the people voicing the characters were ACTING, not just reading the script for the episode.  This is where Andrea Romano is so important--in choosing Kevin Conroy to voice Bruce Wayne/Batman, Conroy caught the lightness of the billionaire with Bruce, but the gritty edginess of Batman; and has arguably made Conroy the standard for all vocal performances--certainly when it comes to Batman.  But the whole of the casting always revealed tremendous depth and talent--Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred.  The man who played Stuart Bailey on ""77 Sunset Strip"" and Lewis Erskine on ""The FBI"" voicing Bruce Wayne's major domo?  Bob Hastings' Jim Gordon--again, a guy who had 30 years in television.  Mark Hamill as The Joker--Hamill has become as distinct doing that voice as he was for being Luke Skywalker.  Adrienne Barbeau voicing Catwoman.  Arlene Sorkin capturing the comedy and danger of Harley Quinn.
  The series was certainly more expansive about getting into the guilt that Bruce Wayne carries about the death of his parents, and was really the first exploration in television that this wasn't so much a secret identity as it is a case of multiple personalities.  Again, the Rogue's Gallery is allowed to be delved into more in this first volume--after all, we had never seen Man-Bat before the first episode of the series.  The complex origin of Mr. Freeze.  Plus, the introduction of the ""regular criminals"" like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone. With many of the villains, there is an element of sympathy that one develops for them.  Certainly, this is true in the ""Two-Face"" two-parter; where a long-subdued psychosis of Harvey Dent fully manifests when pushed out--and then Harvey has the accident that physically turns him...
  Twenty years on, we still see how B:TAS has affected Warners--they have a separate live action and animation division for the DC Characters, putting out animated movies that star major actors voicing the heroes and villains of the DC Universe.  That doesn't happen if Batman: The Animated Series wasn't the critical and artistic success that it was.  It's great theater and storytelling, a standard-bearer and trend-setting series of episodes.
  Highly recommended.",1292716800,,3819,5.144246353322528

Almost every shot is suitable for framing.

2059372,5,B00023E894,"I think this is one of the most impressive animated series I've ever seen, maybe the best.  That's because, in my humble opinion, the artwork is so fantastic. I expected something colorful but this is beyond all expectations.

The brown skyscrapers of Gotham along with the blacks and blues and the tremendous 1940s atmosphere is just beautiful to see. The cars, buildings, clothing, etc.,  are incredible as is all the Art Deco look of the period. Like a good director with cameras, these drawings of Gotham are made from all kinds of angles and are just jaw-dropping at times.  I lost count how many times I'd mutter, ""wow!""

The stories vary from ""tremendous"" to ""fair,"" depending on the villain. The best ones, I found, involved ""The Joker.""  Every time he was on, I continually laughed out loud at the great lines he delivered. Whoever wrote the material for ""The Joker"" should have received an Emmy.

These are basically crime stories, not far-out fantasy tales, although a few of them are in the latter's case. Usually, though, the feel of many stories is that of a tough film noir.

The best episode, I felt, was ""Beware Of The Gray Ghost"" which is pure noir.  It was just spectacular and featured (a very cool touch) Adam West of 1960s TV Batman fame. I can't say enough about that story.....nor this DVD set.",1246233600,2,1318,4.695652173913044

2059382,4,B00023E894,"I grew up watching Batman: The Animated Series on TV.  I would tape every episode, I had all of the action figures, and if there was a new episode on you better not even try to talk to me until it was over.  Little did I know the show I enjoyed so much as a kid was being enjoyed by people of all ages, and would go on to be recognized as one of the definitive screen versions of the character.  And rewatching these episodes as an adult, I couldn't agree more.

First off, you cannot really talk about this version of Batman without mentioning the art style.  The characters are very stylized (just look at Batman's impossibly square jaw), and the world they inhabit is straight out of the art deco designs of yesteryear.  Yet the art direction is so consistant, and the portrayal of these characters so smart and well executed, you cannot help but instantly believe in it.  There is also some really impressive animation to be seen on this set, especially given the typically limited television budget.  However, there is also some really poor animation on display, depending on which overseas studio was handling a given episode.  The quality wouldn't iron itself out until later in the show's run, and unfortunately some of these early episodes are hard to watch because the animation is so distracting.

Another aspect of this show that was ahead of its time is the writing.  Here is a show that was designed from the ground up to air on Saturday mornings, with a target audience of children.  Yet the writers insisted on writing mature, thoughtful stories that were often adult in their emotional complexity, rightly assuming that kids would be able to follow the narrative even if they couldn't grasp all the nuances.  It was this decision that allows people of all ages to watch and enjoy this show, and is the primary reason the show remains popular to this day.  Like any good piece of family entertainment, the writers made something they wanted to watch and just remembered to keep the violence and adult content in check.

However, like the animation, the quality of writing fluxates across this volume.  The mature characterizations and adult problems seen in episodes like ""Two-Face"" and ""Feat of Clay"" have to share disc space with truly poor episodes like ""The Last Laugh"" and ""I've Got Batman in My Basement.""  Luckily, the good outweighs the bad, but a few episodes of dubious quality keep this set from getting 5 stars.

Sound wise, the show is also excellent.  The voice cast is uniformly great, led by Kevin Conroy's definitive take on Batman.  He handles the character's dual personalities with ease, and both halves of the whole are convincing.  The recurring characters all have distinctive voices (you could close your eyes and have no trouble knowing who's speaking), and even better they act their roles with depth and maturity, rather than the over the top portrayals Saturday morning cartoons are prey to.  This keeps the drama believable, and the actors are helped out by an outstanding musical score by Shirley Walker.  Using Danny Elfman's work on the Tim Burton films as a starting point, Walker creates a grand orchestral score able to convey pulse pounding excitement or heartache as needed.  She also creates distinct and memorable themes for each of the main villains, and her work is just a treat to listen to.

Finally, you can't really talk about this set without at least mentioning the Emmy-winning and fan favorite episode ""Heart of Ice.""  The episode reinvents the previously comical, gimmick based character of Mr. Freeze as a tragic figure, a reimagining so successful that this version of his origin has been incorporated into the comics.  I have to say, although I enjoy the episode immensely, it's almost a victim of its own popularity, as it isn't the end-all-be-all some people would make it out to be.  But it is definitely the highlight of this set, and easily one of the series' top 5 episodes.

Anyone hankering for more of the Dark Knight's adventures after the most recent film would do well to check this set out.  It provides an adult and thoroughly entertaining take on the character without some of the extreme darkness found in the more recent movies.  Parents can watch this with their children and both parties will be enchanted.  Definitely recommended.",1220572800,,4319,4.818181818181818
2059383,5,B00023E894,"BOY, they don't make them like they used to. ""Batman: The Animated Series"" is no doubt one of the finest cartoons ever created. Like Burton's 1989 Batman film, this has lots of emotional and psychological depth. The writing is strong, very mature unlike other cartoons (Spongebob should be ashamed). Plus, all of the distinctive characters are very well done, while the animation itself is fantastic. The look and feel of Gotham City is dark, unpleasant, and somewhat Burtonesque. And the music just shines throughout the series.

This DVD box set contains the first 28 episodes. They're all in production order, and not arranged by airdate. Some episodes are pretty weak, but that's only because they're the first episodes of the first season (we're not getting to that psychological depth just yet).

-Episode 1.1, On Leather Wings: This pilot episode has us starting to see that this Batman adaptation is going to be serious business. It's dark, suspenseful, and almost operatic. (5/5)

-Episode 1.2., Christmas with the Joker: Alot of people don't like this episode because of its silly action sequences and unecessary puns. I still watch it because it's good entertainment. And plus, Mark Hamill's voice makes the Joker all the more intriguing. (3/5)

-Episode 1.3, Nothing to Fear: This contains the debut of Scarecrow. He doesn't look frightening enough, but his insane scheme to spread fear all around the Gotham University is scary. (4/5)

-Episode 1.4, The Last Laugh: Another campy Joker episode. This looks too much like the Adam West TV series. The overall silliness makes this a failure. (1.5/5)

-Episode 1.5, Pretty Poison: The debut of Poison Ivy. She looks so darn attractive, but her motive against Harvey Dent doesn't seem to work. P.S., is that Kevin Conroy as the French waiter? (3.5/5)

-Episode 1.6, The Underdwellers: This is one of the weakest episodes in the entire series. The Sewer King is not a believable villain, and the freakishly dark tone in this episode may be even a bit to much. (1.5/5)

-Episode 1.7, P.O.V.: Slightly better than the Underdwellers. But it won't catch alot of people's interest. (2.5/5)

-Episode 1.8, The Forgotten: This may not be interesting to some, but I enjoyed it not only because of the issue of homelessness, but because Alfred rides the Batwing! (3/5)

-Episode 1.9, Be a Clown: We're not getting to the full potential of the Joker just yet. (3/5)

-Episode 10 and 11, Two-Face: Well, now we're getting somewhere! The birth of Two-Face is so powerful and so psychological, that it's sure to give even adults some shivers. Richard Moll is perfectly cast as the main villain. (5/5)

-Episode 12, It's Never Too Late: This is also one of the more realistic episodes that doesn't involve any supervillain. The Mafia plot is a bold move; the cast and crew have done a wonderful job here. (4.5/5)

-Episode 13, I've Got Batman in my Basement: The debut of the Penguin. Here, they went with the Burtonesque appearance that's found in ""Batman Returns"". But here the villain has a much cleaner appearance. The episode itself, however, leaves a lot to be desired. This is more for kids than adults. (3/5)

-Episode 14, Heart of Ice: The debut of Mr. Freeze. This is everyone's personal favorite not only because of the redesign of the main villain, but for its emotional power. (5/5)

-Episode 15 and 16, The Cat and the Claw: The debut of Catwoman. Not a fascinating episode, but it still gives alot of action. (3/5)

-Episode 17, See No Evil: Invisibility is a scary thing, you know. (4/5)

-Episode 18, Beware the Grey Ghost: This is the perfect reflection of how the 60's West show gave us the driving force to create a more darker Batman. Adam West himself guest stars as Simon Trent, who has trouble finding work due to his being typecast. (5/5)

-Episode 19, Prophecy of Doom: Crap, crap, crap. (1/5)

-Episode 20 and 21, Feat of Clay: The debut of Clayface. This ranks with Two-Face and Mr. Freeze as a tragic story. But here, Clayface seems more arrogant than others, and he may have deserved his transformation. But nonetheless, he is a tragic character, and Roland Dagget should have been punished. (5/5)

-Episode 22, Joker's Favor: This is actually the debut episode of the Joker (when it comes to airdate), and his introduction sure feels like the first episode with the Clown Prince of Crime. This is also the debut of Harley Quinn, an original creation from the BTAS crew. This is one of my favorite episodes, though the ending may not bode well with Joker fans.(5/5)

-Episode 23, Vendetta: The debut of Killer Croc. Croc doesn't look threatening enough, but maybe it's because of fear of censorship. (2/5)

-Episode 24, Fear of Victory: Scarecrow returns with a more menacing look. The plot, though, doesn't seem much to give this episode praise. (4/5)

-Episode 25, The Clock King: The debut of, or course, The Clock King. The villain relies on time to fend off Batman and Mayor Hill. He may be a bit dull to some, but I like this guy because he's doesn't have superpowers. (5/5)

-Episode 26, Appointment in Crime Alley: An important episode that deals with Batman and the place where his parents were killed. (4/5)

-Episode 27, Mad as a Hatter: The debut of the Mad Hatter. This is one of my favorite Batman villains, alongside Scarecrow and Joker and Penguin. He's more human than he really is. (5/5)

-Episode 28, Dreams in Darkness: Batman's nightmares are what make this episode. The rest don't work. (3.5/5)",1220227200,2,5489,4.850107066381156

We get a lot of good episodes with top villains such as the Joker, Two Face, Catwoman, Scare Crow, Poison Ivy, ManBat, Croc, Clay Face and the Riddler.

  The Two Face episodes I think are the best since it has the one where Harvey Dent becomes Two Face. He's a Two Face that you can take seriously like the one in Dark Knight and unlike the one of Batman Forever. I also think the transformation from Dent to Two Face is handled better here than it was even in the Dark Knight. While the show is also worth checking out for Mark Hamil's voice over work as the Joker. He does such a ingenious job that it's pretty impossible to tell that Luke Skywalker talks for the Joker lol. This Batman show from the 90's is superior to the more recent show called The Batman as well.

The complaint I have with this DVD is what some others have said, the episodes are out of order! Why? For people like me that like watching the seriesin order, it's annoying. One minute, Robin is there and you don't see him again for a few more episodes after that. For people that don't know any better, they'll be asking ""Where did Robin go?""

2059392,5,B00023E894,"I love Batman: The Animated Series.  Warner Brothers was kind to release it on DVD with bonuses including the pilot promo.  The team behind the animated series executed this in a format where every episode served as a mini movie delivering good stories that were serious but keep toned down just enough to be appropriate for childrens broadcast.  I used to watch this after school on kids WB during my elementary years so it's been cool to  be able to revisit what I loved and still love.  I love that this was dark and slow paced which makes it stand out from everything today because everything today is fast, bright, colorful, and just a bunch of crap.  This was actually intelligent and smart, unlike all the mindless cartoon fluff you see today.  This works for children and adults, so I highly recommend this.",1196553600,,815,4.6573426573426575

These episodes are appropiate for all ages and contain deep driven stories as well as awesome fights between hero and villain. The style of this show is unique and fits perfectly for the tone of the series, and the image they were trying to project for Batman. We see all the classic villains, as well as some created specifically for the series. The only major Batman rogue not to be introduced in this series is the Riddler, but he appears in volume 2. Later works, including Superman: the Animated Series, Justice League, and especially Justice League Unlimited are recommended for fans of this series.

He always carries the psychological advantage, as the criminals are caught off-guard by the shock of his appearance. Sound familiar? Gotham is a prime example of a total environment. Batman is the  personification of de-facto Satanic ideals in many respects. Although personally, I think he spends too much time on saving worthless enemies & the stupid.

This was on the Fox network when I was a sophomore in college.  I loved it then and I still love it today.

This cartoon is great for every Batman fan; those just being introduced and those who've followed the Batman for years.

2059405,5,B00023E894,"I can go on and on about how ground-breaking and exceptional Batman: The Animated Series is, but many of the reviews in the following pages do a pretty good job of covering that. So, the concise version:

-First 28 episodes in production order. Some come off as a little rough (Joker's personality isn't as defined) and there are a few clunkers, but most are great fun and there are lots of classics (introductions to Mad Hatter, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Clayface, the pilot episode).

-Bonus features include 2 commentaries, retrospective featurette, and the original pilot animation used to pitch the series. Not a lot in terms of quantity, but the retrospective packs in a lot of surprise interviews from staff, voice talent, and comic artists. Great stuff.

-Suitable for all ages. Stories are well-written, voice-acting is excellent, high production values and love for source material. Violence could be somewhat intense for younger viewers, but is tastefully handled.

A great addition to any dvd library, whether for the kids or for yourself. The pinnacle of modern animation, and a defining take on Batman. Highly recommended.",1152662400,6,1132,5.169398907103825
2059406,5,B00023E894,"If you are even mildly interested in buying this series, I highly recommend doing so. I was hesitant to buy this show at first, but when I did I was so blown away at how mature and exciting it really was. It had many episodes that I remembered as a kid, and they had so much more impact now that I was old enough to comprehend them. This is one of the most accurate portrayals of the Dark Knight ever made, and truly stands the test of time. Don't hesitate buying this show, you will not regret it.",1150675200,3,498,4.091836734693878
2059407,5,B00023E894,"As much as everyone's said so already, I'll say it again: this is, far and away, the best cartoon of the '90s.  As a superhero series, what set B:TAS off so well from what came before is the depth of its villains.  With the exception of the the Joker, the vast majority of Batman's animated rogues' gallery are sympathetic in some way.  Whatever depths to which they've sunk in desperate pursuit of revenge (or whatever else), behind most of the villains in this series lies genuine pathos, backed up by good pacing and excellent dialogue.  And many of them even have their own distinctive theme music which plays during their appearances.  The tragedy of their origins and motivations make them far more interesting characters than your stock cartoon villain who goes out to wreak havoc just for the hell of it.

Sterling examples of this include the two-part origin stories ""Two-Face"" and ""Feat of Clay,"" which also manage to be surprisingly mature looks at the shame of mental illness in politics, and drug addiction, respectively.  But the real gem is Mr. Freeze's origin, ""Heart of Ice.""  Michael Ansara's voice work on Freeze is superb, and this proves to be one of those rare episodes of a cartoon that is genuinely moving.

Also notable in this volume is the presence of episodes without any costumed villain, but with genuine human drama and a surprisingly intense flavor of compassionate social commentary.  ""It's Never Too Late,"" in which Batman convinces an aging gangster to end a war with his rival, is a solemn, introspective story that may not be especially exciting for young kids, but is nevertheless great writing and great television.  Even better is ""Appointment in Crime Alley,"" which revolves around magnate Roland Daggett's plans to burn down a slum so that he may build upscale housing.  Ed Asner plays Daggett with gleeful menace, personifying unfettered capitalism at its most amoral.

There are flaws in this volume, but most of them have to do with the fact that the series took a few episodes to hit its stride.  Several episodes on the first disc are some of the weakest the series would ever offer, the worst offenders being ""Christmas with the Joker,"" ""The Last Laugh,"" and especially ""The Underdwellers.""  But from the second disc on, no real stinkers are to be found, and the major origin story episodes offered here are some of the series' very best.  Recommended without reservation.",1150588800,6,2420,4.894607843137255
2059408,5,B00023E894,"Attention! These are not episodes from ""The Batman"" television series.

Be warned. These episodes are not in chronicle release order. They are NOT released by seasons. These 28 episodes were randomly chosen from the television sries. However, if you buy all four volumes (which, you should indeed buy) you'll have the entire Batman series. Buy this first volume, and see how you like it. Trust me, you will not regret it!",1150502400,6,3983,4.607898448519041
2059409,5,B00023E894,"What can I say that haven't been said already?  This cartoon series is one of the best of our generation and possibly of all time.  It's mature, smart, action packed, and good for most families, adults and kids alike.  I used to watch this cartoon growing up in my early teens and its still great (am now in my early 20s).  Cartoons these days are a travesty to society and absolutely devoid of morality, character, class, and thought (such as Ren and Stimpy, Cow and Chicken, Beavis and Butthead, Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Ed Edd and Eddy, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force to name a few).  I will grant that some of these cartoons have some entertainment value (some episodes have their moments) but they are not cartoons that I would want my children to watch.

The only gripe I have about these season DVD releases is that its not in order of their air dates.  Of course you are free to look up the release dates online and watch it in that order but I think thats extra effort that you shouldn't have in the first place.  For example, Christmas With The Joker is the 2nd episode on Disc 1 when it was actually aired as the 38th episode on TV.  It's also the first appearance of Robin (I believe) so that means Batman was alone for the first 37 episodes on TV which I think makes a perfect compliment to Batman's lone vigilante personality.  So you might notice a stark difference in animation quality from the first episode on the DVD (On Leather Wings) which was actually the 2nd aired episode on TV when compared to Chrismas With The Joker (the 38th aired episode).

I guess I just get a sense of nostalgia when I watch the series in order of their air date because thats how I watched it on TV and it brings back fond memories.  The series is one of my all time favorites.",1148342400,3,1783,4.353474320241692
2059410,2,B00023E894,"I remember liking this series very much when it premiered.  Not surprising, as I am a huge Batman fan.  I must say that I was extremely disappointed when I picked up the first series.  The prints that they used for the DVD are often scratched and have so much dirt on them that even the commentary on the first disk mentions that one of the characters sleeves looks like it has a case of the measles.  Another criticism is that the series presents some of the villains' origins (Two Face, Man-Bat, Poison Ivy), but in others (Catwoman, Penguon, Joker) they do not.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.  Although I don't particularly like the new Batman series on tv, at least they seem to go from the beginning on all of the villains' appearances (taking their cue from the ""Batman Begins"" movie, I imagine).

My plan was to purchase the four seasons that are available on DVD, but after viewing the first season, I've decided to put that on hold.  I will rent the later entries and see if the problems persist.  If they do I will cross off Batman on the list and just buy the Justice League DVDs as they come out, since they look a lot better and I find that even the stories are more interesting.",1146873600,,1206,4.348214285714286
2059411,5,B00023E894,"This is a pretty good buy.  28 episodes at an agreeable price.  Can't beat Amazon!  This set includes a number of great episodes.  A few that come to mind are Pretty Poison: in which DA Harvy Dent's life is placed in jeopardy by Poison Ivy.(Marks her first appearance, by the way.)  The two part episode Twoface is another must see.  We get to see Harvy Dent fall from grace and become one of Gothum's most unforgetable villians.  And who could forget Heart of Ice in which Batman and Mr. Freeze cross paths for the first time.  You can't help but feel bad for this guy, especially when you see him at the end of the episode.  Freeze is one of my favorite baddies.

  Feet of Clay and The Cat and the Claw are also great multi part episodes.  I love me some multiparters, can't you tell?  Love those cliffhangers and that epic feel to them.  And this set is jampacked with Joker episodes.  Four of them, I think.  If you're fond of the Scarecrow, he has three episodes spotlighting him too.  I don't much care for his appearance in the first 85 episodes, but from what the character creaters say about the new look of him in Batman Volume 4, well that one sounds more menacing to me.  Like the voice better too.

  Ok, so that's enough of me rambling about this fantastic series on this review at least.  Buy this set individualy if you can't aford them all at once.  The great thing about Batman Tas is that they're one shot episodes except the 7 twoparters, but you never have any of these volumes ending with cliffhangers so you can get your Batman fix without being held in suspense while saving up enough for the other sets.  So you gonna buy it or what?",1145059200,,1659,4.360655737704918

We are a little behind the times in the UK and still only on Vol1 (US is on Vol4), anyway, I finally got my copy and I have to say, while it is fantastic to have 28 episodes, I'm EXTREMELY dissaponted that the shows are not in their original broadcast order.

Disk 1 Episode 2 is ""Christmas with the Joker""... I mean, COME ON!! That was Episode 38!! Disk 3 Episode 17 ""See No Evil"" ... that was really epsiode 56!!

I was extreamly sad when they stoped making these episodes. Getting down to it, if you're a avid Batman fan as I am,then this is definetly the DVD's for you.

2059418,5,B00023E894,"By far the best of WB's animated superhero tv series of the 1990s', ""Batman - The Animated Series"" introduced a new generation to the adventures of the Dark Knight. It only ran for three seasons, but it still has a rabid fanbase and is considered by man diehard Bat-fans to be the best adaptation of the source material in any medium.

The first season isn't as consistent as the next two, but being the major Bat-fan that I am, I can't help but give it anything less than a five star rating. This boxed set contains all 28 episodes from that first season, which premeired in 1992.

The best episodes are when Batman faces off agsinst his most famous and deadly foes, and almost all of them appear at least once in these episodes: The Joker, Poison Ivy, Two-Face (the origin of Two-Face episode is the best episode), Mr. Freeze and Carwoman are all here, alogn with lesser known villians such as The Mad Hatter and The Scarecrow (I'll never understand why Scarecrow is such a relatively unknown villian in the Batman universe, since he's such a great character).

Of course, there are a few clunkers. The worst episode is ""The Underdwellers"". It had something to do with an organization of kidnapped children who lived in the sewers and were controlled by some freak who was porobably loosley based off Tim Burton's interprtation of The Penguin from the 1992 movie ""Batman Returns"" (the best live action Batman movie ever). Also, as much as I love Scarecrow, the only one of his episiodes that really does him justice is ""Dreams In Darkness"", which is the second best episode next to ""Two-Face, Pts. 1 & 2"". I was somewhat disappointed by the Joker episodes, although ""Christmas With The Joker"" is a classic. But since the show was just starting out, I can forgive these minor imperfections.

There are some great extras on the dvd, but it's the episodes you really want. With over 600 minutes of Batman, you can't ask for much more.",1135555200,3,1933,4.659824046920821

2059420,5,B00023E894,"In the fall of 1992, this landmark animated show debuted on Fox, and those who follow the mythology of Batman took notice.  Thanks to Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Alan Burnett, and many others, the Dark Knight was brought to life in a highly stylized way in stories that generally followed and respected the comic book canon of the preceding decades.

These first 28 episodes give the viewer fine examples of why this series has become legendary in recent years.  From the opening 'title' sequence (which contains no titles) to the title cards that precede each episode to the 'dark deco' look to the mature storylines, it becomes evident very quickly that B:TAS had no intention of becoming conventional or of catering to the 'kids.'  The entire rogues gallery shows up at some point in this series and in this volume, including obvious favorites like Joker and Catwoman, but some of the best episodes feature more obscure, largely not-yet-animated villains like Clayface, Man-Bat, and Mr. Freeze.  Extras are decent, with a bit of insight into the conception of the show from some of the creators.

This series is a must for Batman fans of any age.  Get all of the volumes, but start here.  Don't miss Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, the feature-length story by the same folks, which is available separately.",1128556800,,1302,4.85972850678733
2059421,5,B00023E894,"This first box set of Batman:TAS is excellent in nearly every respect. It does justice to a wonderful show with excellent transfer and sound and an attractive packaging with enough extras to justify the purchase. The only mark against it is that it uses production order for the episodes, which makes it somewhat difficult to follow. For many shows, production order is the right choice because it is the ""evil"" networks that show the episodes out of order and confuse things, however Batman's production order doesn't make sense as narrative order. For example, Episode #2 already has Robin in it, even though he won't be introduced until half-way through the season. The producers of this DVD did make some corrections to the order (by putting the two-parters in sequence), but it's still hard to follow. It might have been better to list the episodes in a narrative order which was neither air-date order (which strangely puts the Catwoman two-parter in front of the real pilot of the series) or production order. However, since that's my only complaint and it is easily solved by use of a remote control, I can whole heartedly recommend this set. This is the origin of the universe that has spanned more than 5 series, including the current Justice League Unlimited. All fans of that series should get this set to see where it began.",1125187200,2,1337,4.842794759825328
2059422,4,B00023E894,"Some of these episodes are quite good; others are solidly average.  I definitely like the visual look of the universe they created, though.

Be warned if you are a visual purist that the quality of the DVD transfer in the case of these cartoons is so good that it reveals defects in the source material!  These episodes, you see, were made over 15 years ago with traditional animator's cells, not modern CG tools, so many times the lines are gonna look blurry and the colors washed out.  That's not the DVD, though.

However, the final episode on Disc II, ""Heart of Ice,"" in which we learn the origins of the nefarious Mr. Freeze, alone justifies the price of admission.  Holy cow!  That script is so unbearably perfect it'll give you whiplash!  Not one word, not one note out of place!

The other episodes range in quality, although this series is on the whole deemed far above average by Batman fans.",1124409600,,902,4.5875
2059423,5,B00023E894,These animated series are really cool.  They are well written and interesting.  My little boy (3) and me watch them all the time.  If you're little guy likes Batman this is a can't miss.,1123977600,2,186,4.411764705882353

2059425,5,B00023E894,"On the heels of Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns came BatMan: The Animated Series! A unique telling of the Batman legend that hadn't been done before in cartoon form. Most of the prior Batman cartoons were done more in the vein of the 60's Adam West TV series.

This one took the character back to its darker roots much like Burton's live Batman films did. What is here is most of the first season of BatMan: The Animated Series. Done in the unique ""Dark Deco"" style that was never done before this series and I don't think has been done since.

What's interesting is that originally, Batman was going to be a solo cartoon with occassional appearances from Robin but as the series got more popular, Robin appeared in more eppys to sell toys since most kids can't picture the B-man without his ""Boy Wonder."" Still, this volume is mostly Batman by himself with only two episodes featuring Robin (Volume 3 has the bulk of the Batman/Robin team ups).

Here is a list of what's on each Disc and my opinions of each eppy/item:

DISC 1

On Leather Wings - This is one of the first (if not THE first) episodes of the series to air! I am not sure but I think it aired in primetime initially on FOX! That's how big this series was at one point! This episode also has commentary by Eric Rodomski and Bruce Timm.

Anyway, it features Bruce Wayne (well into his career as BatMan) being blamed for crimes committed by his alter-ego. Bruce goes into action as BatMan to find the real culprit and gets more than he bargins for when he meets MAN-BAT!

Christmas With The Joker - One of the most popular episodes as Batman and Robin try to save hostages from being killed by The Joker on Christmas Eve!

Nothing To Fear - The first appearance of The Scarecrow as he forces Batman to face down his greatest fear!

The Last Laugh - One of the more comical but classic duels between The Dark Knight & The Clown Prince Of Crime!

Pretty Poison - When D.A. Harvey Dent is poisioned at a restaurant, Bruce Wayne (as BatMan) investigates Harvey's new fiance who turns out to be more than just a pretty face.

The Underdwellers - Batman stumbles across homeless children being forced to work by a cruel madman!

P.O.V. - Three different tales of a police bust that has Batman's life on the line!

THE DARK KNIGHT'S FIRST NIGHT - The original promo by Bruce Timm. Very different looking that what we know now but still unique to look at!

DISC 2

Forgotten - While investigating a case of homeless men being taken off the streets, Bruce Wayne goes missing and loses his memory while being imprisioned!

Be A Clown - Being ignored by his father Mayor Hill, his son turns to a clown for attention. Unfortunately, he turns out to be The Joker!

Two-Face, Pt. 1 - This begins the story of the end of Harvey Dent and the beginning of one of the most tortured enemies of Batman's career.

Two-Face, Pt. 2 - In a race against time and gang lord Rupert Thorne, Batman tries to hunt down Two-Face to save him before its too late!

It's Never Too Late - Gang lord Thurmond Strong is torn between his gangster power and saving his own son (and even his soul) as both Batman and Rupert Thorne are after him!

I've Got Batman In My Basement - Injured by The Penguin, Batman takes refuge in a 12 year old's basement!

Heart Of Ice - The first appearance of Mr. Freeze! Transformed from the cooky character he was in the Adam West BatMan, Mr. Freeze is more of a sympathetic character who wants nothing but revenge on the one who murdered his wife! This episode has alternate commentary by Paul Dini, Eric Rodomski and Bruce Timm.

BATMAN: THE LEGACY CONTINUES - A retrospective featurette!

DISC 3

The Cat And The Claw, Pt. 1 - Here we get the first appearance of CatWoman in the series! We also get a brand new villian in Red Claw.

The Cat And The Claw, Pt. 2 - Stumbling onto a plot that's in over her head, Batman tries to save Catwoman but will Batman be scratched out!?

See No Evil - A deranged thug is out to steal his daughter from his ex-wife using an invisible cloak! Batman comes to shed a little light on the situation!

Beware Of The Grey Ghost - Special episode because the man that brought Batman to life in the 60's, Adam West, voices the Grey Ghost himself!

Prophecy Of Doom - A con artist claiming to be a prophet is swindling millions out of Gotham's influential and only Batman can put this scheme out of business!

Feat Of Clay , Pt. 1 - Matt Hagan was a big time actor who's career was nearly ended by a disfiguring accident until gangster Roland Daggett offered him a solution at a price! Now, that same solution which saved his career transforms him into a grotesque figure which can take any shape or form!

Feat Of Clay, Pt. 2 - Hagan, now known as Clayface, seeks revenge on Roland Daggett with only The Dark Knight to stand in his way!

TOUR OF THE BATCAVE - Interactive tour of Batman's famous lair!

DISC 4

The Joker's Favor - A poor civilian makes the mistake of chewing out The Joker in traffic. In exchange for his life, The Joker makes him promise him to do a favor, a favor he may live to regret!

Vendetta - A witness goes missing and Detective Harvey Bullock is a suspect in his disappearance but Batman discovers another who may have motive to see both the witness AND Bullock share a watery grave!

Fear Of Victory - Gotham's finest pro athletes are suddenly paralized with fear! Its up to Batman and Robin (who is also striken with fear) to solve this mystery!

The Clock King - Blaming Mayor Hill for losing a case years back, Temple Fugett plans a timely revenge on the public official! The only snag in his plans is The Dark Knight.

Appointment In Crime Alley - On the night of his ""appointment"", Batman has to save the neighborhood in which his parents were murdered from arsonists!

Mad As A Hatter - Tervis Jest is a lonely little genius who invents mind control cards to sweep a woman, ironically, named Alice off of her feet! His advances, however, are rejected and this mad genius is swept into a blind obssession.

Dreams In Darkness - The unthinkable happens as BatMan is locked up in Arkham Asylum as The Scarecrow hatches a scheme that may put all of Gotham in Arkham!

Well, this package is worth your $30 bucks or so! This cartoon is one of a kind and may never be duplicated again! Own this one and lock it on your shelf!",1122940800,7,6347,4.4006849315068495
2059426,5,B00023E894,"I loved this show when I was a kid. I may have been older than the target audience (too old to buy the merchandise) but I thought that the Noir style of animation, the mature storylines, and the underlying moral themes were excellent. I decided to buy Season 1 on a lark.

The first episodes do have spottier animation, but it clears up. I still think the stories are great. This was a show that was ahead of its time and ended too soon. I recommend it to any Batman fans, and particularly those that liked the show.",1122163200,,516,4.26530612244898
2059427,5,B00023E894,Absolutely Amazing!!!  Watching this show in full surround sound on a Large Screen T.V is a must for all Bat fans.  It makes you realize this was just not a childrens cartoon and is a clear example of animated storytelling at it's finest.  I only wish animation was as good as it used to be and anyone who enjoys fantastic old school animation will be enthralled by the Batman compilations.,1121817600,2,390,4.542857142857143
2059428,5,B00023E894,"I admit, I was not a fan of the show when it originally aired on TV. I did catch a few episodes now and enjoyed watching them, but didn't have time to see every one of them. Now that the series is out on DVD, I am glad that I can watch all the episodes whenever I want to! After watching all the 28 episodes, listening to the commentaries, and enjoying the special featurettes, I am glad that I bought this DVD. Given below are my reviews for each episode in this DVD box set:

Disc 1: 1. ""On Leather Wings"" - A good start to the series, we get to see how Batman clears his name by going after the Man-Bat. This episode also contains an audio commentary by Bruce Timm and Eric Rodomski, the executive producers of the show. (4/5). 2 ""Christmas with the Joker"" -This is a little different, but still a good episode where we get to see Batman and Robin in action. The highlights of this show are the scenes where Batman and Robin save the people on the train and when they go to the Laffco Toy Factory to defeat Joker. (4/5). 3. ""Nothing to Fear"" - This was another great episode where we get to see Batman confront his darkest fears while trying to catch the Scarecrow, who is putting fear on the citizens of Gotham. (5/5) 4. ""The Last Laugh"" - I loved this episode because it was purely action-based, and kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. The scenes where Batman is trapped underwater, or where he is trying to defeat ""Captain Clown"" is terrific! (5/5). 5. ""Pretty Poison"" - The first episode with Poison Ivy in it, this was a good episode, but was a little slow and predictable. (3/5). 6. ""The Underdwellers"" - A very David Copperfield like tale, I really liked this episode because it had action (fight with the crocodiles) and comic relief (Alfred trying to take care of the boy). (5/5). 7. ""P.O.V"" - This is a very different and interesting episode, not because of its storyline, but because of the way it is told, through three people. (4/5).

Disc 2: 8. ""Forgotten"" - The main reason I found this episode so good was because we get to see how Bruce Wayne would defend himself and fight crime as himself and not as Batman (5/5). 9. ""Be a Clown"" - This episode is once again the fight between Batman and the Joker, and is another amazing episode! The Joker always puts Batman in situations where it seems impossible for Batman to escape from. The scene where Batman is suspended inside the water-filled box and the rollercoaster scenes were great! (5/5). 10 & 11. ""Two-Face Parts I and II"" - The first part of the episode is really good because it deals with Harvey Dent's multiple personalities, but the second part is a little boring. Overall, this was still a good episode to watch. (4/5). 12. ""Its Never Too Late"" -This episode is a little stale compared to the others, since it doesn't deal with Batman that much. (3/5). 13. ""I've got Batman in my Basement"" - This episode was filled with action and laughter. It is the first episode to have the Penguin in it. It was so much fun to see a couple of kids protecting Batman from the Penguin. It is also good to see that Sherman finally gets the respect that he deserves in the end. This is definitely one of my all time favorite episodes. (5/5). 14. ""Heart of Ice"" - The first episode to have Mr. Freeze in it, this was a very good episode in which we can see how Batman is able to fight Mr. Freeze. From the audio commentary for this episode, told by Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and Eric Rodomski, we can also see the various mistakes in the show, that we would have initially dismissed (5/5).

Disc 3: 15 & 16. ""The Cat and the Claw Parts I and II"" -This is one of my favorite 2-part episodes. The chemistry between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Celina Kyle/Catwoman is great to watch. The storyline was very intriguing, where Batman had to face fighting two women. (5/5). 17. ""See No Evil"" - I really liked this episode because we see how Batman faces an enemy whom he cannot see. The way in which he tries to fight Lloyd is very interesting. (5/5). 18. ""Beware the Gray Ghost"" - I LOVED this episode, because we can see how alike Batman and the Gray Ghost (Simon Trent) are. A very interesting and intriguing story, that kept me captivated throughout (5/5). 19. ""Prophecy of Doom"" - This was an average episode, because we find out in the beginning that Nostromos isn't who he claims to be, but nevertheless, it was fun to watch (4/5). 20 & 21. ""Feat of Clay Parts I and II"" - The first part of the episode is a little boring, except to see how Matt Hagen is changed to Clay Face, but the second part is great!! The animation which they used for Clay Face's morphing is really good. (4/5).

Disc 4: 22. ""Joker's Favor"" - This was not a very good episode. Considering it has Joker in it, it should have been more intriguing, and Charlie Collins just doesn't do it. (3/5). 23. ""Vendetta"" - This episode starts off well, with Bullock being framed and all, but it slows down once Killer Croc shows up. I don't feel he is such a good villain compared to the others. (3/5). 24. ""Fear of Victory"" - This was another great episode with the Scarecrow. (5/5). 25. ""The Clock King"" - I loved watching this episode, mainly because the Clock King doesn't have any supernatural powers and is not a crazy scientist type either, but still manages to beat Batman, just because he is more efficient (5/5). 26. ""Appointment in Crime Alley"" - A very average episode, there wasn't anything too great about it except the runaway trolley scene. (3/5). 27. ""Mad as a Hatter"" - I enjoyed watching this episode, simply because of how the show managed to incorporate ""Alice in Wonderland"" into it (5/5). 28. ""Dreams in Darkness"" - I am beginning to like episodes with the scarecrow in them more and more. A great episode from start to end! (5/5).

Special Features: ""The Dark Knight's First Night"" - This is a 5 minute documentary with Eric Rodomski and Bruce Timm, showing the original promo theme that they had made for the show. ""Batman: The Legacy Continues"" - This was a good featurette on the various cast and crew members of the series, and how they described the animation of Batman and all the villains. I never realized how difficult it must have been to draw the different faces that Clayface could merge into, until I saw this.

As Bruce Timm and Eric Rodomski mention in the audio commentary of ""On Leather Wings"", what probably made this animated series so popular was its unique animation and its dark atmosphere. Even though it was initially made only for children, people of various age groups got hooked on to this show. The background scores to the episodes were also amazing, as they added to the distinctiveness of the series. Even though the series aired during the early 90s, when watching it now, it gives a more vintage, classical look to it, making the show look even better.

This is a great addition for anyone, whether you are a Batman fan or not. Even though I was not a fan of the series before buying this DVD, I certainly am now.",1119830400,2,6992,4.445050662509743
2059429,5,B00023E894,Para cualquier fantico de la serie en latinoamerica o paises de habla castellana o espaola.  Poder ver la serie en espaol o con subttulos es simplemente genial le recomiendo este ttulo a cualquiera que se concidere un verdadero fanatico de la serie.,1119398400,4,249,4.928571428571429
2059430,5,B00023E894,"I am a big Batman fan. I watched Batman The Animated Series (The Adventures of Batman & Robin) when I was a kid. I am very excited it is on DVD now. I just seen the new movie Batman Begins. Batman Begins was awesome and probably the best Batman movie ever since Michael Keaten's Batman. However, I wish they did made Batman Begins part of Michael Keaten's Batman Saga, but they made a new beginning of a 21st-Century Batman. I love all the seasons of Batman The Animated Series (The Adventures of Batman & Robin)/The New Batman - Superman Adventures, Batman Beyond, Justice League Unlimited, and Teen Titans. I hope they made volume or season collection for Batman Beyond, Justice League Unlimited, and Teen Titans. I also love Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman the #1 Superman TV series ever, Smallvillle, and Birds of Prey. I was disappointed that Birds of Prey got cancelled. I think Birds of Prey was awesome Batman live-series better than Adam West's Batman. I know Birds of Prey wasn't really about Batman just about a secret that he never shared, his daughter, Huntress and Batgirl becomes Oracle. I just got Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman Season 1 on DVD and it's awesome. I also have the Complete Superman Collection starring with Christopher Reeve and the Batman Legacy starring with Michael Keaten, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney on DVD. Now I will buy Batman The Animated Series (The Adventures of Batman & Robin) on DVD. I really think that Michael Keaten, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale, and the ones that did the voice from Batman The Animated Series to Justice League Unlimited are the best Batmans and better than Adam West.",1119225600,,1678,4.769759450171821
2059431,5,B00023E894,"Sometimes I wondered how they did it, but despite the show rarely displaying death, this show gives realistic action.  This is no Super Friends that display both heroes and villains as idiots with ray guns.  This series, in my opinion, is what brought Batman back to life -- despite some thinking it was maybe the movies.

What had happened to Batman?  I've heard a lot of punches thrown at Adam West, but the fact of the matter is, Adam West's Batman was MEANT to be a comedy.  It wasn't meant to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately, the Super Friends...well, I think the people who made them must have been high while watching an episode...and while drawing their cartoons...and probably most of the time...

To make a long story short, this series is fantastic with a superb voice team that has little equal.",1107216000,7,810,4.702127659574468
2059432,5,B00023E894,"This Batman collection set has 28 season-one, heroic adventures presented in Full Screen format on 4 disks. There are exactly 7 episodes on each disc. The set also contains 2 documentaries and 3 featurettes in addition to the original episodes.

What the artists tried to accomplish here, and successfully completed, is use an old style of animation--called Art Deco--by cell creating, one drawing at a time, on dark paper and then painting the different colors and images onto it; thus, giving this cartoon a vintage look--something like the 40's Superman animation--which is why Batman looks so dark and rather old. In fact, this is what the producers, Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and Eric Rodomski had in mind when taking on this project: They wanted Batman, The Animated Series to have a dark yet mysterious appearance. It is one of the reasons, aside from the great story writing, this faulting franchise became revitalized and an incredible success--thereby revolutionizing the superhero genre and opening the way to modern action, superhero cartoons created to this day, from modern Superman to the Justice League Unlimited.

If you're into cartoons at all or know someone who is, go ahead and purchase this set, as it would make a great addition to anyone's collection. It is definitely worth the money. Plus, it's an award-winning series. What more can you ask for from a quality product?",1107043200,,1391,5.069868995633188
2059433,5,B00023E894,"I was mildly obsessed with this show when it originally aired in the early 90s.  When I saw that they were releasing it on DVD, I was a little hesitant to pick it up.  Eventually, the low price for the number of episodes won me over and I bought it.

This show is every bit as good as I remembered.  Although intended for a children's audience, this is an intelligent show where the primary focus is on character development.  It frequently touches on the core of Batman's identity and his motivation to fight crime.  The show did such a good job portraying the motivations of both Batman and the villians he faces that many of the embellishments the show made, such as The Joker's sidekick Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze's backstory, were eventually included in the official Batman comic canon.

This show does a better job of portraying the Dark Knight, particularly as defined by Frank Miller, than any of the Batman films.  Many fans of the comic despise the films, but accept the animated series as a more accurate characterization of Batman.

This series sparked the resurgence of super hero animation that we are still seeing today with Teen Titans and Justice League.

Whether you enjoyed the show when it originally aired or if you're just a fan of Batman, this DVD is a good buy.",1106524800,5,1286,4.6255506607929515
2059434,5,B00023E894,"This is one, if not, my favorite show of all times. This collection holds the first release of my favorite episode of all time, Heart of Ice ((which won an Emmy)). This is quite possible the perfect Animated Series, with as much power as Cowboy Bebop or anything else from Japan.

This show is dark. So dark that at the time, when it was released and I was 15 I asked if it was really appropriate for children.

In contrast, the original Superfriends version of Batman was all about gadgets and bright colors. This one is dark and gritty. The original Adam West live action show was about stylized combat, goofy vililans and the ""COMIC BOOK!"" feel with its whams and KAZAMM!s. This is about realism, and a man who wrestles everynight with his own personal demons.

This is the Dark Knight as Frank Miller saw him, as how he was in the begining. This is the man tortured by the memory of the murder of his parents. He is on a quest for redemption ((though he may never find it)) for the crime of being eight and unable to help defend them.

The villians have a heart and a face in this series as well. We learn through Bruce of Two-Face, originally the close friend of Bruce Wayne. We see Poison Ivy as a pasionate conservationist, who likes plants a bit more than people. The Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime, is given a face beyond sheer mania, and we see a world where his actions make sence, if only to him.

It is true in some spots the animation can be rough, however, it is excusable. This is a show that dared to say that it wanted to be taken seriously.

The extras on this set are as varied and full of depth as the Batcave itself. In it, as mentioned, is the original animated test ((which bares a striking resembelance to the show's opening title sequence)). It also contains a history of Andrea Romano, ((the Voice Casting Director)) Bruce Timm, and Paul Dini ((authors and producers of the show)) and Kevin Conroy ((the Voice of Bruce/Batman)). The revelations they bring to the table sent chills down my spine.

This show came out only 2-3 years after Tim Burton's Batman live action movie. The animated series has all the girt of the Burton movie, and more of Batman at heart. I cannot recomend this enough.",1106006400,5,2222,4.444717444717445
2059435,4,B00023E894,All I can say is that the CD collection's box does NOT list which episodes are in the collection. Does it start from the first episode and go throughout season one? I just won't buy it if it's another mixture of episodes. Can someone please answer this?,1104969600,,253,4.404255319148936
2059436,5,B00023E894,"I was born in the early 80's.  Although I've always enjoyed cartoons, I look back today on G.I Joe, Transformers, and He-Man (though I enjoyed them at the time) as nothing but empty and hollow dumbed-down stories with over a dozen characters each who served no purpose but to sell cheap toys.  Batman: TAS was also a Saturday morning cartoon I enjoyed at the time, but after buying this DVD set I'm willing to say that this is a modern classic series that I will never grow tired of.

I completely agree with all of the praise that other posters have already written.  These episodes have real stories with inventive twists and well-developed characters; they exist in a highly inventive unforgetable art-deco world that's half Dick Tracy and half James Bond.  The voice actors are all superb; many were not veteran voice actors but they gave expert performances and clearly didn't treat the project as just some cartoon (my highest regards go to Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight, Efram Zimbalist Jr. as the deadpan Alfred, the former Mr. Skywalker Mark Hamill as the Clown Prince of Crime, and Michael Ansara as the haunting Mr. Freeze).  In short, this is a rare show that kids will enjoy while also being serious and mature enough for adults to admire as well.

While short on extras, the set features a making-of documentary, the rarely seen mini-pilot, and two creator commentaries.  In the extras, co-creator Bruce Timm says that, shortly after the series' final run, people would tell him that they thought of his show first when they thought of Batman, not the comics or the camptastic Adam West series or any of the movies.  After seeing the show's first season, you will likely see why.

Batman: TAS is among my favorite shows of all time, up there with the Simpsons and MST3K.  The second season can't arrive soon enough for me.",1102723200,3,1838,4.730407523510972
2059437,5,B00023E894,"Each episode is a mini film with drama, comedy, pathos -- inspired by the Fleisher Brothers cartoons produced by Paramount in 1940 featuring Superman, early Batman is unparalleled by anything else in modern animation.",1102723200,,217,5.411764705882353
2059438,4,B00023E894,"Sure, we all love the series, take a look at any of the other reviews to see how wonderful we all agree it is. But for those of us who care more dearly about our beloved show, let's take a closer look at the presentation.

First off, Warner Brothers and Warner Home Video are like Dr. Jekle and Mr. Hyde.  WB prides itself on the high quality of its' films.  They are often innovators with movies like The Matrix, and often willing to take  chances, like with Warner Animation and Batman: The Animated Series. Meanwhile, Warner Home Video is far and away still the worst home video company.  I could go on and on about their horrible mismanagement, but for now let's stick with Batman: TAS.  For years the fans begged for the series to be released on DVD.  When they finally got their wish, Warner HV gave us the infamous single disc editions that were so universally despised, as you can see for yourself on their respective pages on this site.  Go and read the reviews for yourself, if you haven't already.  It took a long time, but they finally listened and released a proper box set.  But did they really listen to us?  Not really.  This set is only a mild step up in overall quality of the presentation.  Most TV show DVD box sets have commentary on all or nearly all the episodes.  Out of 28, how many did we get on this set?  Two.  Paul Dini and Bruce Timm have TONS to say about this show.  There were so many episodes that I wanted to know more about!  I pray that they'll comment on EVERY episode next time around, or at least bare minimum have a featurette that touches on each episode in the set.  The one featurette that is included is well done and it's one of the highlights - ""The Legacy Continues"" - but at 17 min, it's barely able to scratch the surface. Paul filled an entire book, BATMAN: ANIMATED, on fascinating information about the show, such as the extremely tight censorship, the music, character design,  to the beautiful title cards.  I hope they can do a featurette on all of these topics and more.  How about mini-docs about the show's difference from the comics, or in-depth histories of the characters - not just their animated incarnations [Ra's Al Ghul especially]. The other features on the discs aren't even worth mentioning.  Which leads us to the menus.  All  the menus are painfully static.  It would be nice to see some animated menus, but what they could really use is more of Shirley Walker's wonderful music from the series.  The main title is all that's offered and only on the main menu, and it's already heard unobfuscated at the beginning of every episode.  How about putting in some of the tracks that we've only heard underneath effects and dialogue? The irony here is that the old discs had a few bits of such music on the menus, so why none here? If they really want to but together a stellar DVD, how about a few isolated score tracks?  After all, every episode had an original score. As for the video transfer itself, no complaints here - It's good enough.  Sure, it has lots of scratches and paint flecks, etc.. but those appeared on the original airings.  I seriously doubt that the series will ever be digitally remastered from the original animation cells - it's prohibitively expensive and I can't think of any FEATURES off the top of my head that have had that done, let a lone a TV show.  Those with CRTs will never notice, but those of us with HD screens are going to see that the picture quality is only average.  And last, the packaging is very well done, the only problem is they've decided on a shared design with the other animation box sets that were released concurrently.  It may work for those other shows, but it's far too colorful for Batman. The upcoming Volume 2 is blue, so it won't look nearly as odd.

So in summary, all we can do is hope that the future sets have many, many more features.",1100304000,,3867,4.452347083926031
2059439,5,B00023E894,"I first saw the Tim Burton Batman 1989 movie with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, and immensely enjoyed it. I immediately loved the Joker, of course, but I had not seen any other Batman movies/shows. I hadn't even read a Batman comic before.

But then, since my brother is into Smallville, I checked to see what else John Glover was in and found that he played the Riddler in BTAS! I didn't really care much, but I told my brother and he thought it was cool. His friend, a fan of Batman, told him to buy the BTAS DVD, and I am so glad he did.

He had me watch an episode, and I, of course, chose Christmas With the Joker. I thought the series wasn't going to be that great, and that the Joker couldn't match Nicholson's portrayal, but I was wrong. I found out that Mark Hamill is the perfect voice for our flamboyant, hilarious Joker with his squeaky, British accent and secretive undertones that make Joker funny yet deadly. Needless to say, I ended up falling in love with the series.

After watching almost all the Joker episodes, I gave the others a try and found that they are all just fabulous. The dark setting of Gotham, and the intelligent plots and scripts were fantastic.

Being a screenwriter/poet/story writer myself, I enjoy the colorful stories because even though some things are obviously unrealistic (Scarecrow, Clayface, laughing gas, etc.), the emotional realism is what makes it relatable. You can feel for Batman, and see that he is a person, not a bat or just a hero. I also love his Bruce Wayne alter ego, and I feel that everyone is two people: one with close friends and one with strangers/associates. Even the villains have feelings people can relate to. Especially the emotional depth of Mr. Freeze, Harley Quinn, the Joker, Two-Face, Clayface and many others. Most animated shows don't really get into bad guys' feelings, but BTAS does.

The animation is also top-notch. The dark-deco system is remarkable and sets the perfect tone for Gotham. I like the white slits of Batman's eyes versus the open ones of live movies/shows. The characters look realistic, (Bruce, Alfred, Ivy, Harley, Robin, etc.) most of them do anyway. And those who don't look quite like people you see everyday (Two-Face, Joker, Clayface, etc.) are captured impeccably, having them look super-human almost but keeping real facial expressions and human-like features.

Now, I couldn't have a review without mentioning the incredible voice talent of this show. I'll start with Kevin Conroy as Batman/Bruce. He's the best voice for him, I can't think of anyone who could portray Batman/Bruce like he does. He has the perfect balance between his monotone, deep voice as Batman and his normal, friendly voice as Bruce. No one in live movies/shows can beat his voice talent. ""I'm your worst nightmare!""

Of course, Mark Hamill as the Joker is amazing. Perfectly depicted as an insane, hysterical, over-the-top jokester, yet deadly and flirtatious at times, just how he should be. The slightly British voice is flawless, sometimes high-pitched, sometimes normal, and others in pure, impulsive rage at nothing really. And even if he's not making a joke, his voice alone will get you laughing. ""I ask you, Harley, who's given more hours of amusement to the police force than me? I deserve, nay, DEMAND the right to honor our dear commissioner as well.""

Alfred and Robin are voiced well also. Alfred has a perfect British voice and Robin sounds like he should, young and clueless.

The Riddler, voiced by John Glover, is one of the best characters because of his intellect, and his almost sane persona. Glover does a great job with his sophisticated voice.

Arleen Sorkin portrays Harley Quinn, the Joker's lover and partner in crime, superbly. Harley was based after Arleen after all, and no one else can beat her at the bubbly, playful Jewish/New York accent. ""Here's to our Commissioner G. You lock up the weirdoes, the crooks and the geeks. You're a hero to all the boys in blue, but this time, baby, the joke's on you!""

Speaking of Harley, the only episode on the DVD with her in it, is her debut Joker's Favor, where the Joker noticeably treats her a little nicer than his usual mistreatment and irritation with her. That is one of the best Joker episodes, and I look forward to more Joker/Harley episodes in the future.

Like most others, I can't wait until BTAS Volume Two comes out December 7th! I hope they make a volume three with the rest of the BTAS and also the New Batman Series (Mad Love, Beware the Creeper, etc.)

If you like this DVD, and I'm sure anyone who buys it will, I highly suggest Batman: Mask of the Phantasm and The Batman/Superman Movie (World's Finest). I've yet to see Sub-Zero, but I'm sure that's good too.

If you're a Joker or Harley fan like me, I'm sure you'd love the Mad Love comic if you haven't already read it!

Even if you're not a Batman fan now, or maybe not too much, pick up this DVD and you'll be one in a matter of minutes. I talk from experience!

Well, I've been writing this review for a while now, and although I'll probably realize there's something I've left out after I submit it, I ought to get back to writing my Batman comic. ""Sayonara, sucker!""",1098403200,15,5203,4.701098901098901
2059440,5,B00023E894,"I remember rushing home from school when I was young to watch this show.  It's amazing just how good the overall content of the show is.  Superhero shows, before this, were never this character driven and the previous episodes story never had an impact on future episodes.  Not the case with Batman.  Everything is chracter driven with a secondary action emphasis and the past is not forgotton as the show progresses.

This set includes all 28 episodes that span over 4 discs.  The transfer to DVD was done with care and the episodes look brilliant.  I remember how drab the colors were on the original television broadcast, however on the DVD the blues are blues, the blacks are black, etc.

My favorite episode from the 1st season is Heart of Ice with Mr. Freeze.",1098230400,3,765,4.656716417910448
2059441,5,B00023E894,"Batman: The Animated Series still looks incredible after over a decade since its original broadcast.  Its intelligent writing, slick visual design, quality acting, orchestral music, and above-average animation set a standard that influenced many cartoon shows that followed afterwards.  In many ways Batman is still stronger than many of today's American animated programs.  It is also simply better than the live-action Batman movies.  In my opinion the Animated Series is actually a stronger interpretation than the 1989 movie because while the 1989 movie has awesome visuals, the Animated Series has superior writing in addition to striking visuals.  Key to the writing were tight plots and detailed development for every character.  Batman himself was well-written as a compelling multidimensional character.  Villains were presented as complicated individuals and even characters who only appeared in one episode were interesting.  The series also incorporated a good variety of villains, from colorful ones like Joker and Scarecrow, to realistic ones like thugs, mob bosses, and white-collar criminals.

All the voice actors were perfectly cast in this series.  Mark Hamill (aka Luke Skywalker) totally owns the role of Joker, and Kevin Conroy remains for me the ""real"" voice of Batman.

The animation, while generally above average, is a bit uneven in quality since several different studios worked on the show.  Some studios like Akom were a bit rough, while others such as TMS, Spectrum, and Sunrise put together SPECTACULAR work.  Episodes that were weaker in animation quality are still highly watchable due to the strong writing.

I have to take issue with the official editorial review above by Charles Solomon, who suggested that the animators somehow failed because they used a more realistic approach to the animation instead of stylized movement in order to match the visual design.  I personally feel that the animators struck a good balance with their approach.  It gave the stylized designs some grounding and made the world of Batman: The Animated Series very immersive and believable as though it could be a real place.  While stylized animation works on some projects, it would have made this series look too abstract and detract from the believability.  Here the more realistic animation adds a lot of depth and weight to the cool-looking characters and backgrounds.

The extras are short but sweet, with the original pilot clip and commentary by the show's creators on the how the show got started.  Solomon also contradicts himself at the end of his  review by suggesting that the series, which he had wanted more stylized, would have been much better if it had matched the original pilot clip. However, the pilot is actually in many ways rendered more realistically than the rest of the series.

My only real complaint is that the sound quality should have been redone, so that it would play louder.  But other than that, it's about time this DVD set came out!  It is a must-have for any fan of Batman and animation.  I highly recommend it!!!",1096848000,9,3069,5.176470588235294

There are some problems with this dvd transfer. The video quality is not that well done. While viewing the episodes, you can see a lot grain on the film stock. The quality could have been bumped up for a dvd set like this. The sound quality is not that great as it is only two channel dolby. Again could have been improved on for the dvd set. All in all this dvd set is a great buy if you want to watch Batman: The Animated Series. I do recommend it to any fan.",1095897600,2,620,4.008064516129032
2059443,5,B00023E894,"It has been years since this highly stylized animated series was broadcast on television, yet it still remains one of the most popular cartoons of all time. Set in a 30's, 40's style Gotham City, Batman made its presence known with its unique and remarkably groundbreaking animation. With the help of such creative geniuses as Bruce Timm and Paul Dini, this timeless classic was able to make its way onto television and into the hearts of the young and old alike. Never has a cartoon been able to create such distictive characters, and rather than the typical good vs. evil, the makers added substance and meaning to the villains. One of the most powerfully created villains was Mr. Freeze, who after nearly losing his wife, sought revenge and began an arduous and vengeful journey to destroy anyone who stood in his way. Although he was claerly evil, the audience could not help but feel a bit sympathetic towards his desperate cause to help save his wife, Nora Fries. No other series has ever been able to surpass this tragic foe, even to this day, which is what makes Mr. Freeze one of the most popular villains of the series.

 Harley Quinn, who made her debut in ""Joker's Favor"" is a doctor-turned-villain who easily became the favorite female foe with her ""screwball"" persona and humorous, yet deadly, personality. Originally sent to Arkham Asylum to study the notorious behavior of the Joker, she inevitably fell deeply infatuated with him, and later helped him escaped, leading her to accompany him on a life of crime.

 This dvd set is truly remarkable, as it is able to evoke the same excitement and fascination as it did when the shows originally aired. Twenty-eight episodes are contained on 4 discs, each including a bonus feature. The bonus features are somewhat mediocre; it would have been a great idea to have included some footage of the animation department, behind-the-scenes making, and a slideshow of some of the concept art. Still, this set is rated 5 stars simply because it beautifully brought back a piece of history, and it brought reminders of why I rushed so hurriedly from school to see the episodes, from the catching opening themes, to the credits at the end. I have never had the same enthusiasm to do that today, which further proves the genuinity of talent that helped make this show so engagingly addictive. If you are a fan of Batman, this is a definite must-have, as it chronicles a time when cartoons were actually worth looking at, but even if you're not, this special set will make you regrettably wish you were.",1095379200,7,2553,4.782312925170068

I have seen some reviews on here complaining about the quality, but i find the quality to be of the highest!! To be able to relive the show that I loved when I was a kid is awesome.  The only bad thing that I have to say about the collection is that it jumps around, rather than going chronologically.

2059451,3,B00023E894,"Okay, so I'm thrilled that Warner Brothers finally bit the bullet and released the first boxed set of one of the best animated TV shows of the nineties, but how hard would it have been for them to put the episodes in order?  They have all the episodes, and I'm sure they are aware of the order in which they broadcast them.  With a lot of shows this might not have been an issue, but there is a fair amount of continuity to this series, and it's jarring to start with the second episode of the season and then jump to the Christmas special that aired 37 episodes later.

Otherwise, the dvd is fine.  The episodes do look a little VHS-ey as some people have mentioned, but it's over ten years old, and who knows how they archived tv animation episodes in the early nineties.  Apart from the short pilot included in the first disc, the extras are a little stingy, but beggars can't be choosers.  I just wish Warner Brothers hadn't been counting on that fact to sell this boxed set.

I'm taking a star away for the discontinuity and another star for unscrupulous conduct.  Batman couldn't do much better than that, except maybe to give some WB executive a pummeling.",1093910400,25,1163,4.452830188679245

In the comic books, struggling actor Matt Hagen (aka ""Clayface"") was seduced by the potential for fame and in such pursuit, sold his soul in an attempt to become a star, but instead became ""Clayface"".

""Heart of Ice"" is a story starts off with the dangerous Arch Villian ""Mr. Freeze"" and evolves into the tragic tale of the doomed Nora Fries and her devoted husband, Dr. Victor Fries. It is perhaps the best episode in the entire series. It also combines a fireplug, a ""freezing gun"", and a tall building to create one of the most memorable visual sequences I have ever see set to animation. And these are just two.  ANd of course, the voice chose for this character (part manace, part sadness, all ice-cold) provided by Michael Ansara could not be better.

Not all episodes are at this high level, but though some are ordinary, most are good or very good (""On Leather Wings"", ""Dreams in Darkness"") - both thematically, and visually.

Batman had stark visual stylings, dark undertones, deft and attention grabbing plots and a great performance by Kevin Conroy who will forever be the voice of The Dark Knight. If you've seen this show or even if you haven't, your missing out on something great by passing it up.

Everyone should know the story of Batman. Bruce Wayne is billionaire playboy by day and the Dark Knight Batman by night. He's made a vow to stop crime since he was a boy after the murder of his parents. This show tells this tale and it does it very well.

Batman The Animated Series looks pretty good for an animated show. A lot of people have comlained of the detail of the animation or the lack there of. I think it's great saying this is a low budget animated daily show. I've never had a problem with the animation.

They put together a great cast for this show. Kevin Conroy has a perfect voice for our hero. It's dark and edgy and perfection is all you can really say about it. The producers always put together great actors for the voices. Mark Hamill as the Joker was always my favorite. A lot of poeple wonder what happened to Luke Skywalker and he became the Joker in Batman and the Hobgoblin in Spiderman. Kate Mulgrew is Red Claw. Ron Perlman is Clayface. You have to love what they did in casting.

The episodes were always great on the show and this Volume includes 28 of them. All of them are great though some are better than others. The most adgervating thing they did though is they didn't release them in order. You jump all over the series with each episode and it is frusterating at times.

The DVD extras are good. The retrospective featurette is great. The commentary is good and isn't all that boring. You won't be to disapointed with the extras.

I love this show and I love this DVD. This was such a great show. It won an Emmy in 1993 for best animated show under a half an hour and it's easy to see why. The dialogue is great and the characters are unique. They develop them great throughout the show.

If you love Batman you have to pick this up. Batman-The Animated Series is the best Batman out there. This dark edgy cartoon show is fun for all and should be enjoyed all. Don't miss out on this one. No, serious Batman fan is complete without it.",1092182400,5,2203,4.255980861244019
2059456,5,B00023E894,"For years, I've been hoping that someday Warner Bros. would produce a DVD boxset for Batman: The Animated Series, instead of putting a random four episodes on one DVD.  Well, that time has finally arrived.  The Batman I grew up on has finally returned, and I enjoy him even more now than I did before.

Growing up on 'Dark-Deco' could be called traumatic and just plain weird by some, but Batman:TAS was a big part of my childhood.  I watched it everyday after school, seeing the origin's of my favorite villians and my childhood hero protecting Gotham City.  Naturally, I grew out of cartoons all together, but I would always frequently check Amazon and the like for updates on a possible release for DVD.  Well, this past June, it finally popped up!

'Volume 1' contains the first 28 episodes of the series.  'On Leather Wings', 'Heart of Ice', 'Feat of Clay', and 'Two Face' are the gems of the set, showing not only excellent artwork, but downright awesome writing as well.  Warning:  Frequent Viewings for nostalgic purposes are possible.

Well, unlike some, I really didn't mind what order the episodes were put in.  I actually prefered the way they did it on the boxset so I could see (hopefully..) the ones that were to appear in Volume 2 and beyond!

This deserves every 5 star rating it gets.  Batman fans have finally got what they've been clammoring for.  If these sets continue, we'll be able to see some of the more underrated episodes of the series in Volume 2, including both ninja episodes, the creepy 'Tyger, Tyger', 'Robin's Reckoning', and my personal favorite Joker episode, 'Joker's Wild'.  After seeing this set sell out within the first DAY of release at the local Best Buy, Warner Bros. will give us more of the good stuff.

Bottom Line:  If you're a fan of the series, groundbreaking cartoons, or just a casual Batman fan, pick this up.  I garuntee you won't be dissapointed.",1092009600,17,1901,4.706060606060606

I was a little anxious at first, wondering if what had seemed like great entertainment as a kid would appeal to a more mature viewer 10-11 years later. The end result: while some episodes have their fair share of corny lines and implausable moments, there are some that are truly great: fun to watch, well-written, perfectly scored, and emotionally rendered. The highlights for me were the Joker episodes, hilariously voiced by Mark Hamill, the tale of Two-Face's creation, and ""Heart of Ice.""

 On Leather Wings-Batman battles the Man-bat, and great animation during the transformation and fight sequences is the highlight. Overall: B+

 Nothing to Fear-The Scarecrow uses chemically inhanced fear on Batman, who must confront insecurities about letting his murdered parents down. Good emotional finale, with the famous quote by Batman ""I am Vengeance. I am the Night. I am Batman!"" Overall: B+

 The Last Laugh-The Joker uses laughing gas on Gotham City. Great entertainment, with an aparant ode to ""The Terminator"" thrown in for good measure. Overall: B

 Pretty Poison-What starts out as a slightly corny dating episode turns into a great duel at the end. Very Cool. Overall: B+

 P.O.V.-Great animation and Film Noir-style storytelling. Overall: B

 Be a Clown-Another Classic Joker episodes features both a runaway kid and a runaway rollercoaster. Overall: A-

 Two-Face parts 1 & 2- Fantastic, emotional storytelling, with great characters. Classic. Overall: A

 Heart of Ice-Mr. Freeze lets his story be told the right way. Another Classic, once again full of emotion and excellent writing. Overall: A

 Feat of Clay parts 1 & 2- A man turns into a clay blob that and can change himself into anything. Cool story, great animation, nice ending. Overall: B+

 Joker's Favor-A personal favorite as a kid, the Joker messes with a boring suburbanite father and tries to blow up a police celebration in the process. Overall: B+

 Dreams in Darkness-The Scarecrow tries to turn Gotham's water supply into fear-water; Batman gets an early dose and is put in Arkam Asylum. Overall: B+

2059458,5,B00023E894,"Indeed it has been a long wait, but it was worth it. I have seen many television shows and am a huge fan of animation, but I have never seen ANYTHING on American television that can match the sheer brilliance of Batman: The Animated Series.

 I come from a family with diverse interests (where often family members do not like the same kind of shows), yet I remember with great fondness how my ENTIRE family would sit down five days a week (and for a while, six!) to watch this incredible show. When I told my parents I was getting this boxed set, their first question was ""Does it have my favorite episode?"". It's been a long time since this show first came on TV (something like 10 years I think), but it hasn't lost any of its sparkle.

 First of all, the stories told in this show were adult in nature. Not adult as in loaded with sex and violence, but adult as in having a PLOT, real characters that you cared about, intelligent scripting, and some actual SUBSTANCE.

 Some people claim that this show was sometimes great, and sometimes not. I think they're crazy. Some people claim that this show has not aged well. I believe they are insane as well. Almost every single episode of this series is awesome. Granted, there are some standout moments, but almost ALL of the episodes are worth watching many, many times.

 This show is style AND substance personified. Everything is done in film-noir style with an amazing universe that combined 1920's and 1930's with futuristic technology. You have black and white TVs, Tommy guns, and early 20th century skyscrapers combined with futuristic computers, underwater breathing devices, and ultra-slick gadgetry. The wonderful music composed for this series suits the action perfectly and adds to the atmosphere tremendously. The animation is by no means flashy, but the style is perfect and the action sequences flow perfectly. The voice-acting in this show is quite simply the best in the history of television, utilizing everyone from Mark Hamill (who IS the joker), to Adam West, David Warner, Paul Williams, and Kevin Conroy (who IS batman).

 Perhaps the greatest reason why this show is so classic, and so PERFECT, is that it's creators took it VERY seriously, and looked for ACTORS instead of voice-actors, SCRIPT WRITERS instead of cartoon script writers. Everyone gave this show their all, and it shows.

 All of the episodes included in this set are good, but some are just plain AWESOME. There are moments that stick in your head, lines that you can never forget. I can repeat many, many scenes of episodes word-for-word (even though I had only seen them once before).

 Every episode of this show was done in a short film style. That means that every episode tells a complete story and stands on its own. But even so, later episodes subtly make references to things that happened in previous episodes, making them that much better if you've been paying attention from episode 1 (the later episodes where we see flashbacks of Bruce Wayne being trained to be an escape artist and in the martial arts are particularly good examples). Of course, this is only the beginning of the series, so people checking it out for the first time can look forward to a great, long story ahead of them.

 If there is anything to be criticized in this DVD set, it's two-fold. One, the picture quality leaves a little to be desired. It is WAY better than the VHS, and the colors are probably better than ever, but there is a lot of speckling and smudging from the original film that could have been cleaned up (didn't it have less of that on television?). The other flaw is the lack of chapters within episodes. Granted, 7 episodes per disc with a total of 28 episodes included total is a GREAT value, but not being able to skip the intro and ending will annoy some people undoubtedly. Of course, I love the intro and ending so much, and they are so SHORT anyway, I really don't mind at all.

 Words cannot describe my joy at finally being able to own Batman: The Animated Series on DVD. I can hardly wait for the rest of it...",1091491200,12,4068,4.649930264993026

As a fan of this series I feel a bit shorted by this selling tactic. Maybe it was to see if there was a market for this? Maybe this was only recently considered in the wake of the DVD TV complete season boom. However which way you look at it though, it is still a cheap move that ultimatly hurts the fans in their support of these releases and their wallets.

  That said, this is an awesome show. The value is fantastic and I eagerly await volume two.",1091232000,,585,4.15929203539823
2059460,5,B00023E894,"Charles Solomon's Amazon.com Editorial Review is one of complete ignorance and dismissive bias. The Batman Animated Series remains as a hallmark of everything that a cartoon series should be - intelligent, well-written and full of slam-bang action. His compairison to Genndy Tartakovsky's work to the Paul Dini/Bruce Timm group is like compairing salt-melted slugs to the work of Richard Fleischer. There is no compairison - and I urge Amazon to quickly remove his review, it's insulting to the rest of us with taste and intellect who don't masturbate to the ""hot, new trends"" simply because they're there.",1091059200,5,606,5.257731958762887

What a great show.  I am up to show 8 and am really enjoying the trip into Batman.  It is engaging animation and the voices are really excellent.  Many of the stories are good.  It was well worth it.

I have caught episodes of Batman Beyond, which I really liked.  I guess that is what made me open to the Dark Knight.

I see that  Challenge of the Super Friends - The First Season is out ... I kind of remember this as a kid I think.  I am thinking of getting it.

I don't know what's good.  I have heard positive things about Justice Leage but there are no full-season box sets which I prefer.  Is it good?  What about the Batman Superman adventures?  And I see other Batman series.  I would prefer to stick to the good stuff.  If anyone has some opinion and feels like dropping me a brief note, that would be much apprciated.

It came out with a degree of controversy because it was so dark.  Every episode is very intelligently written- something I really couldn't discern as a kid.  Each episode actually feels like a mini-movie, complete with its own orchestral score.  The voice cast is very good as well- including Mark Hamill (Star Wars' Luke) as the Joker.

2059468,5,B00023E894,"If you haven't seen Batman: The Animated Series and you like Batman, animation, some of the later shows from its creators (such as ""Justice League"") or superheroes in general... you owe it to yourself to check out this surprisingly mature, beautiful show.  From the get-go the creators of the series were focused on making a series that they would enjoy, not just a series for kids.  It shows in the writing, which can easily stand up against the best dramas on television.  No wonder Fox aired Batman: The Animated Series as a prime time evening series for a short while.  This is Batman as he was defined for a generation of fans, and for many, this is still the definitive portrayal, outshining even his comic book origins.
Here you get a great collection including some of the series' best episodes, including the Emmy-award-winning ""Heart of Ice.""  Special features including funny and informative commentaries on both ""On Leather Wings"" (the initial pilot episode) and ""Heart of Ice.""  The commentaries talk more about the series as a whole than the individual episodes, but nonetheless remain entertaining.  Seen here as well are a number of brief featurettes that look behind the scenes of the series, including the rarely-seen brief ""pitch film"" created by the producers as a test reel to sell the series.  The features are not terribly extensive (though what is included is very well-put together and entertaining), the menus are not very exciting and the episodes themselves completely lack chapter stops - a most unfortunate oversight.  Yet it's all made up for by the video quality and the quality of the stories themselves.  The episodes have never been clearer than they are here.
28 episodes are shown here in the intended order, which is also the ""production order.""  This is not the same order that they aired in, but it IS the best order for coherent storytelling; many episodes had their context ruined by the random airing order of Fox.",1089763200,6,1957,4.9179331306990886

Further, so many of these voice actors are also big hollywood celebrities in their own right like Richard Moll, Ed Asner, Heather Locklear and so many more. The commentaries and featurettes were an excellent bonus as well. I particularly enjoyed the short film Batman's First Night.

2059470,5,B00023E894,"Warner Bros. started releasing episodes of the award-winning ""Batman: The Animated Series"" (BTAS to fans) on DVD in miserly single-disc editions containing four or five episodes apiece. Fan complaints and common sense have finally made Warner Bros. realize the potential of this acclaimed and hugely popular series and have released the first volume of episodes in a deluxe package: 4 discs, 28 episodes. The shows are presented in production order, with a few variations to put the multi-part episodes together. The sound is an improved Dolby Surround 2.0, and the picture is beautiful. There are some extras -- not a huge amount -- but the real feature here is the shows themselves. There has rarely been an animated show that has achieved this level of quality writing and artwork. Heck, rarely do LIVE action shows achieve this sort of quality!
BTAS was released as children's programming originally, but the animators, directors, and writers turned it into something of adult complexity (not that kids don't love it too, but adults tend to be the biggest fans, mostly comic book lovers). Freed of the constraints of selling toys, the filmmakers created an intricate show that was true to the dark, psychological side of Batman and his adversaries. Instead of sticking to boring formulas usually associated with animated TV shows, the writers made sure each episode was something unique, and kept drama always at the forefront. The animation is spectacular and fluid, the action scenes have a kick to them superior to many movies, and the orchestral scores contribute to the feeling of something special.
Not all the episodes are great, of course, and some of the early ones in this package show the creative team struggling to discover the direction and tone of the show. But most episodes are good to excellent in quality. The writing team did a spectacular job at fleshing out minor baddies like Mr. Freeze, The Clock King, and The Mad Hatter into the full-fledged great villains with complex motivations. The voice work by familiar TV and movie actors also raises the quality of the characterizations. For many people, Kevin Conroy IS Batman...his dark, edgy voice is forever rooted to the character.
Here is a breakdown of the episodes and features on the four discs:
DISC 1: Contains episodes ""On Leather Wings,"" ""Christmas with the Joker,"" ""Nothing to Fear,"" ""The Last Laugh,"" ""Pretty Poison,"" ""The Underdwellers,"" and ""P.O.V."" The first episode is the best on this disc, with Batman facing the fearsome Man-Bat. The show really hit the ground running, but the immediate follow-ups are a bit weak. ""P.O.V."" has moments of interest because of its unusual structure, and ""Nothing to Fear"" has a great finale, but the two Joker episodes are particularly poor; the show hadn't quite figured out its style yet. Also on this disc is commentary by Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski for ""On Leather Wings,"" and a two-minute demo they did to sell the look of the series.
DISC 2: Contains episodes ""The Forgotten,"" ""Be a Clown,"" ""Two Face (Parts 1&2),"" ""It's Never Too Late,"" ""I've Got Batman in My Basement,"" and ""Heart of Ice."" The last is one of the most popular episode of the series, introducing the fantastic re-imagining of Mr. Freeze as a tragic figure. ""Two-Face"" is also a superb villain origin story. The other episodes are minor, with a poor Joker and Penguin episode, but ""It's Never Too Late"" is an interesting non-super-villain story. The bonus feature on this disc is a great 18-minute documentary about the series, with interviews with the producers, writers, and some of the actors. There's also audio commentary on ""Heart of Ice"" with Timm, Radomski, and writer Paul Dini.
DISC 3: Contains episodes ""The Cat and the Claw (Parts 1&2),"" ""See No Evil,"" ""Beware of the Gray Ghost,"" ""Prophecy of Doom,"" and ""Feat of Clay (Parts 1&2)."" The show was clearly taking off at this point; only ""Prophecy of Doom"" is a poor episode. ""Beware the Gray Ghost"" brings back Adam West to the Batman series, and is one of the most inspirational of all the episodes. ""Feat of Clay"" contains stunning animation, and ""Cat and Claw"" gives us the wonderful relationship between Batman and Catwoman. The bonus feature is a Batcave tour, basically a few screens of text and some connected montages of images from the show.
DISC 4: Contains episodes ""The Joker's Favor,"" ""Vendetta,"" ""Fear of Victory,"" ""The Clock King,"" ""Appointment in Crime Alley,"" ""Mad as a Hatter,"" and ""Dreams in Darkness."" Two lesser villains, Clock King and Mad Hatter, become the focus of great episodes. ""The Joker's Favor"" is one of the best Joker episodes, and introduces Harley Quinn, who would become one of the show's most popular creations. The two Scarecrow episodes aren't much, however. The bonus feature is a plug for some of the other DC heroes.
One warning: If you buy this package, be prepared to see your free time get drained away! It's impossible to stop watching episodes once you start, and most of them reward multiple viewings. Recommended as a MUST for all animation and super-hero fans.",1089676800,418,5070,4.965882352941176
2059471,5,B00023E894,"Batman The Animated Series is a truly great series. Credit this to great animation, a great score to the series, compelling storylines and a cast of characters which I think is the best of any comic series. I can remember watching this show when it originally aired pretty much every afternoon, but only now with the dvd release do I truly appreciate what this series stands for. The creators of this series worked hard to create the truest form of Batman and the project was taken very seriously. The result is one of my favorite animated series ever, and definately the best super hero oriented series.
First of all, content. Volume one contains the first 28 episodes from the series. As I watched each episode I was surprised to remember almost every episode from watching it over 10 years ago. Not one episode on here is a bad one. Some of my favorites include Heart of Ice, The Last Laugh, Joker's Favor, Two-Face and Mad As A Hatter. I think Batman has the best collection of villains anywhere with my favorite of course being the Joker. But in this set we also see Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, Catwoman, Manbat, Clayface and the Clock King. Some people have complained at the order the episodes are presented. So what? The fans finally get a great set of 28 complete episodes so that is a stupid thing to gripe about. 28 episodes, along with some interesting featurettes that go behind the scenes into the production of the show, make this a Batman fan's dream. The series comes on 4 discs packaged in a nice box with some great artwork on it.
As far as picture and sound quality, it is little better than it was on its television airing. That is okay with me though because it is just like I remember it. People should also know that some of the dust seen in parts of the show were products from the unique animation process used, which is explained in one of the featurettes. So yeah, it could have been cleaned up a little better, but personally I could care less. Overall I was more than happy with Batman volume 1. I recommend it to fans of the show then as well as people who find this creative style of animation fascinating. I think it is fairly priced, so the set we have gotten is a truly great one that I recommend to any DVD collection. Many many hours of entertainment packed in a nice boxed set only has me wanting Volume 2 so much more. If the quality presented here is retained in further volumes, the DC comics classic collection will be a great line.",1089676800,2,2491,4.476923076923077
2059472,5,B00023E894,"When this stylized and surprisingly action packed animated series hit Fox Kids in 1992, it was an instant hit and it's easy to see why.  Inspired by Tim Burton's motion picture and Frank Miller's comic series Dark Knight Returns; Batman - The Animated Series finds grim millionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne (voiced by Kevin Conroy) fighting crime in Gotham City as Batman, and his rogue gallery has never been used better.  Facing off against the Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Man-Bat, Scarecrow, Clayface, and the Mad Hatter.  The animation itself is stylized, but as the Amazon review states above, the show looks better in stills than it does in motion.  That aside though, the show was a smash hit (many consider the series better than any of the live action films, and I agree), and continued to carry on in future seasons and features such as the fantastic Batman: Mask of the Phantasm and Batman/Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, and the underrated 1999 series Batman: Beyond.  It's about time Warner Bros. decided to release the show in complete volumes instead of the usual four episodes per disc packages, and with the upcoming Batman Begins around the corner, now has never been a better time to meet the Dark Knight.",1089676800,3,1234,4.942028985507246
2059473,5,B00023E894,"It's finally out!  Batman: TAS.  This edition has a little bit of improved sound from the original broadcast, but still looks a little cloudy.  This is mainly due to the the original animation process; cell dirty and uneven cell painting results in the flaws.
This edition comes with two commentaries by creators and some very nice special featurettes.  The batcave feature is down right disappointing and at times a little unsettling.
Be forewarned.  The first time I purchased this set, there were DVD glitches in two episodes on Disc 1 (Last Laugh, Christmas with the Joker).  In the second one I bought, there doesn't seem to be any problem, so I don't think this is a batch wide problem.

2059474,5,B00023E894,"What an amazing DVD set this is. I bought this knowing that my favorite cartoon of all-time would have gotten finally good DVD treatment. Prior to this, I had bought one of the single animated Batman DVDs, and then ended up selling it to Gamestop for money. So many incredible, compelling episodes crammed into 4 discs is well worth the price. Batman without a doubt is one of the best, if not the best, and most intriguing and powerful characters ever created in comic books. His rogues gallery is unmatched and bounds ahead of Superman's lame rogue gallery (The Parasite, Livewire?). The video quality may not be the best, but it is certainly better than any VHS. The audio quality is surprisingly pretty good, with DD 2.0 treatment.
I was impressed with the special features as well, and I liked the Tour of the Batcave feature though thought they could've stapled on an Arkham Asylum ""Rogues Gallery"" tour. That would've been cool, as well.
After the single DVD letdown of Legend of the Batwoman comes this amazing DVD set. If you're a fan of this series, go out and buy it today. I am hoping they release Batman Beyond, Superman: The Animated Series, and Justice League all seasonal on DVDs.",1089590400,,1196,4.7
2059475,4,B00023E894,"I've been wanting this DVD set for a LONG time now. I was dissapointed before that Warner Brothers chose to release only single disc volumes of the show before, but now they finally gave us this sweet 4 disc set. Unfortunately, the special features are on the light side, and the video quality ain't so hot. Scratches and dust are everywhere, however it's far from un-watchable. The show itself manages to retain that same charm that captivated me when I was a kid, and it's still every bit as cool today as it was back then. An awesome series, and I'll definately be watching this DVD set alot in anticipation for the new live-action movie, Batman Begins.
I really hope Warner Brothers chooses to release boxed sets for Superman: The Animated Series and Batman: Beyond. Both of those have only gotten the ho-hum single disc volume treatment as of yet, and it'd be really great to see the new ""DC Comics Classic Collection"" expand to cover those excellent shows too.

I appreciate this show for capturing the true essence of who Batman is and what he stands for. I also think that its awsome how the animated series stays true to the comics and reintroduces the viewer to Batman's Rougues Gallery which features some of the greates villans in comic book history.

2059480,5,B00023E894,"This is a great set of the Batman animated series from the early-to-mid 90's.
Another reveiwer comments on the graininess of the print at times. Well they explain why this is so on the extras/commentary. These episodes were done before digital editing and work became the norm through the whole process. This stuff was all done on cels with real paints and such. The places the cels were painted could have so much dust in the air that it was insane and it got on to the animation cels. Do they look horrible? Not at all! But some spots looks worse than others.
Bruce Timm comments that they wanted to capture the 'vibe' of the Fleischer 'Superman' cartoons. I think that they do an amazing job. If you didn't know when these were made you would swear it was decades ago.
My only complaint? For some strange reason, the second disc does not want to play in my computer's DVD drive unless I reduce my display resolution to 800 x 600. Weird.
Great collection. I am looking forward to the others that will be forthcoming!",1089331200,,1018,4.508108108108108

2059483,4,B00023E894,"This series is just terrific!  From scripts, voices, backgrounds and character designs we're likely to never see anything as boldly produced in TV animation for a long time, if ever.  It's a treat for Batman's legion of fans, animation nuts as well as those who just enjoy great stories.  Ultimately that's what makes the series so successful, the deeply emotional and complex stories/characters.  It's impossible to forget the heart-wrentching episode ""Heart Of Ice"", or the dramatic story of Two Face's creation, or the Batman centered ""Appointment In Crime Alley"" once you've seen them.  These stories (and many others in the series) stay with you and become mythic.  Just as a great Batman story should.
From a technical standpoint the episodes hold up very well.  Some episodes contain quie a bit of grain, but in a show that is set in a timeless retro-future world, it actually helps create a sense that these shows have been been around for ages.  Each disc in this four disc set contains seven episodes and one bonus feature.  The bonus features included are:
""The Dark Knight's First Night"" - Pilot promo Hosted by Bruce Timm
""Batman: The Legacy Continues"" - A look at how the show came to be with it's creators
""Tour of the Batcave"" - Short video clips about various aspects of Batman
""Other DC Super Hero Favorites"" - Trailers for the Superfriends DVD, Justice League and Mystery of the Batwoman
By far the best of these features are the first two.  Also included are commentaries for the episodes ""On Leather Wings"" and ""Heart Of Ice"" both of which are done very well.
My one big complaint (and the reason I'm not giving 5 stars) is that the episodes are not presented in the order of their original airdate or even in their order of prduction.  The episodes seem to be almost ordered randomly, though two parters are kept together.  Disc one starts off with episode 2 then jumps all the way to episode 38, then back to 10, 15, 9, 27 and finally 13!  This makes watching the shows evolution extremely difficult.  Another gripe, there are no chapter stops for the episodes.  Neither of these problems should stop someone from buying the set, but it does detract from the DVD experience.
Shows - 5 stars
DVD presentation - 4 stars",1089072000,36,2240,4.737113402061856

You can tell the animation is not as sharp as some of the new episodes (Batman, Superman, and Justice League), but you will still get a sense of how ground breaking that style animation was for its time.

2059485,5,B00023E894,"Batman: The Animated Series was a groundbreaking, Emmy-winning series that ran from 1992 to 1997 on FOX, including the later re-named (but the same show) The Adventures of Batman and Robin.
You have never seen a Batman cartoon until you have seen this.  I hesitate to call it a cartoon, because that is technically what it is, but no cartoon I know has ever explored its characters so deeply, especially that of Batman.  The same fierce determination that has criminals in fear and awe also precludes him from being able to relate with those in his life, such as Robin.  There are a few people like James Gordon and Dr. Leslie Thompkins who see that, and reach out to him.  The complicated relationships of all the characters are portrayed very realistically and in deeply moving fashion.  Batman extends a kind of mercy despite the trauma that led him to sweep the night sky in search of criminals.  His refusal to use a gun or to take a life is clear.  The voice acting is superb.  Each Batman villain has his own theme music, in fact each individual episode has music by a full orchestra composed for it. The stories take Batman back to his roots by showing his domain, Gotham City, in the Art Deco style of the 1930's.  Every detail, such as older model police cars and street lamps lends to the richness of the series.  Indeed, this is a series for adults more than children, which explains its 5:00 p.m. time slot when it first debuted in 1992.
Many fantastic episodes are on this DVD, from the deeply touching Appointment in Crime Alley, which explores the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, to the non-stop thrill ride On Leather Wings, featuring the terrifying Man-Bat.  An immensely popular new character to the Batman universe, the winsome Harley Quinn, is introduced in The Laughing Fish.  Everyone will have their favorite BTAS episodes; it is good this DVD has so many to choose from.",1088380800,7,1895,4.674698795180723
2059486,5,B00023E894,"In 1992 Warner Brothers Animated revitalized the afternoon half-hour animated television program with an old and recognized friend: Batman. Called Batman: The Animated Series, the show - mirrored after the dark and gothic look and feel of the Tim Burton movies - was a smash success and spawned the animated superhero back into prime form. Now finally the program is coming, complete, to DVD.
Batman: The Animated Series changed everything - it brought well-told half-hour stories, flawed yet somewhat sympathetic villains, sadness and loss (for Bruce Wayne), and a wonderful variety of locations and diabolical plots. While the animation was sometimes lacking (some episodes were definitely better than others), the series also happened to feature a unique musical score per episode (Danny Elfman composed the main theme while Shirley Walker oversaw the music) and truly wonderful voice-over talent (the use of Adam West for ""The Grey Ghost"" was simply brilliant).
After all, what other show can boast the following cast: Michael Ansara, Ed Asner, Rene Auberjonois, Adrienne Barbeau, Ed Begley Jr., Tim Curry, Melissa Gilbert, Mark Hamill, Ernie Hudson, Brion James, Heather Locklear, Roddy McDowall, Richard Moll, Diana Muldaur, Kate Mulgrew, Ron Perlman, Brock Peters, John Rhys-Davies, William Sanderson, Marc Singer, Helen Slater, Loretta Swit, David Warner, Adam West, Treat Williams, Paul Winfield, Michael York, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.?
This DVD set includes the first 28 episodes; audio commentary for the episodes ""On Leather Wings"" and ""Heart of Ice"" (by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and Eric Rodomski) are included as part of the special features.
Episode highlights (I won't summarize all of them) include:
THE GREY GHOST - A series of crimes hit Gotham - crimes that are similar to an old crime-fighting series called ""The Grey Ghost,"" a show that Bruce Wayne used to watch as a child with his father. This episode is terrific on so many levels - from the casting of Adam West as ""The Grey Ghost"" to the nostalgic feel of an earlier, simpler time - that it deserves nomination as one of the best episodes in the series' run.
JOKER'S FAVOR - Family man Charlie Collins' singular act of road rage goes horrifically wrong when it turns out the other guy is The Joker, who makes Collins one of his ""pet projects."" The Joker intends to use Collins in his plot to get revenge on Commissioner Gordon, but who will get the last laugh in the end? Some nice bits of humor near the end when the plot comes to a satisfying conclusion - good stuff.
APPOINTMENT IN CRIME ALLEY - Batman always visits the place of his parents' death, on the anniversary, with long-time friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins, a homeless advocate who comforted Bruce right after the murders. This time around his appointment is delayed as he runs into seemingly ever-increasing obstacles, including Roland Daggett's plans to level the entire area.
THE LAST LAUGH - It's April Fool's Day, and The Joker would never pass up an opportunity to play a nasty prank on Gotham - this time involving a garbage scowl featuring his patented laughing gas. It's a typically standard episode, but the music is pretty catchy.
THE CAT AND THE CLAW - Gotham's new cat burglar, Catwoman, runs afoul of Batman in more ways than one - then has to come to grips with a new organized crime syndicate run by the mysterious Red Claw. Adrienne Barbeau as Catwoman, come on!
ETERNAL YOUTH - Bruce Wayne gets invited to the Eternal Youth spa; while Alfred and his lady friend decide to go on vacation, Batman uncovers a more insidious conspiracy involving vanished wealthy industrialists and Poison Ivy. This episode features one of the more horrific ways to be disposed of.
That's just a portion of the variety of episodes: great plots, villains, humor, darkness, music and voice talent mark Batman: The Animated Series as one of the best of American television in the 1990s.",1088294400,32,3913,4.993874425727412
2059487,4,B00023E894,"Truthfully one of the most stylistic and best animated action series to date.
The show concentrates on the darker and more tortured aspects of Batman, and though they're toned down a bit they're still quite effective.
The acting is done quite well.  Mark Hamill, of course, shines as the Joker, as does the casting for Batman.  After an episode or two you couldn't imagine the voices being done by anyone else.
The star, however, is clearly the animation.  Backdrops are drawn on black paper, giving it a truly dark and grimy feel.  It captures the spirit of the series quite perfectly.
The release is a well done one, but not 5 stars simply because it feels almost like an afterthought.  Commentary and extras feel tacked on, but they aren't the point.  You get quite a bit of bang for your buck with the amount of episodes.
Buy it for your kids, buy it for yourself.  You'll greatly enjoy this boxed set.",1088035200,5,906,4.590062111801243

2059489,5,B00023E894,"A little clarification is in order here.  Some people have asked/inquired about when ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"" were going to be released.  Well, ahem...it's the same show as ""Batman: TAS"".  The first 65 episodes (1st Season) of Batman: TAS were called just that.  The 2nd season, 15 episodes were renamed ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"" because, surprise, these featured Robin.  However, in syndicated re-runs, the entire series was renamed ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"".  5 more episodes were later produced and aired, bringing the total up to 85.  This closed out the series known as ""Batman: TAS""/""The Adventures of Batman & Robin""
The series ""The New Batman Adventures"" was a completely different show.  This is the one that included Superman in the title as well.  This show had different animation.  This show consisted of two seasons of 16 and 11 episodes respectively totalling 27 episodes.  Rumor is that WB will release these sets as well.  But not until the original Batman: TAS is done.
""The Superman Adventures"" ran for 54 episodes consisting of 4 seasons from 13-28-10-3 episodes each respectively.  I can see this series being broken up into two volumes of 27 episodes each.  Which would mean that the entire ""The New Batman-Superman Adventures"" series would consist of yet another 3 DVD volumes.",1087862400,26,1328,5.032110091743119
2059490,5,B00023E894,"It's about time that the Batman Adventures are being released on DVD.

I will buy the complete ""Batman The Animated Series"" (all three volumes?) but i'm also expecting ""The Batman and Robin Adventures"" to be released too, so where is it??!  TV Box sets are definately in and its about time these were released on DVD.
I'm also relieved that WB has finally gotten a clue and priced this set fairly compared to other Animated cartoon box sets. If the Simpson's Season 1 is around $35 then so should this. People have come to expect fair pricing on box sets and up until now, Batman Animated DVD's have been way overpriced.

Suggesting that there will only be 2 more volumes to make a complete set. Please Note: The episodes go in order of ""production"" & not which ""aired"" first. This is important to note because seasons 2-4 were not produced chronologicaly. They were all made roughly the same time but some that were made one year came out the next year, etc. This explains why the WB opted for a Volume 1 vs a Season 1. (Also Season 1 had like 50 episodes or so) There's also a promise of a decent amount of bonus material, NOT a crazy amount but decent never-the-less. All in all, this still makes the purchase more than worth it, and we all should be thankful that the wb didn't do something ridiculous like 4 episodes a volume. <whew> thats a relief on my wallet.",1087257600,16,952,4.3841807909604515

The japanese character designs, and the darkness of the cartoon just made it so worth waking up for. I remember when the TV network that aired the show here (London) used to get complaints from parents about how violent it was. (Ha ha). Finally I can watch these all again.
They'd better release all of em. And Batman and Robin.
(Incase you're wondering why it's called volume 1 and not season 1, it is because there were 60 episodes in the first season. Why they didn't make this a 30 episode set and just split the first season into 2 is beyond me. But so long as they all come out I don't care.)

2059500,5,B00023E894,"After years of steadfastly ignoring the wishes of its fan base, Warner Brothers has finally decided to release its landmark Batman: The Animated Series in a 28-espisode box set of four DVDs, instead of dolling the episodes out at a sluggish four or five at a time! We can only hope that the remainder of the Animated saga, which was actually comprised of three separate ""series"" that ran from 1992-1995 will be released on DVD in short order.
The creators set to their task after the first Batman movie and somehow managed to capture the essence of the comic book world of Batman, without the gore of the mainstream comic book titles.
In one of the last hand-painted animation shows ever to have been rendered, Batman: The Animated Series is as flawless a rendition of Bob Kane's mythic creation as ever captured on comic paper or film, both live-action and animation. Time will tell, but I believe the Batman Animated saga is worthy of being crowned the greatest animated series to have ever been produced. Regardless of its place in history, it changed the animated genre forever as well as the comic book and film depictions that spawned it. It is pure magic.
The ""Dark Deco"" design of Gotham City and all of the characters in the Batman mythos were deftly crafted by many of the modern comic industry's greatest talents including: Alan Burnett, Paul Dini and Bruce W. Timm. Every subtle nuance was anticipated and superbly rendered in serious stories that merged the childhood wonder and excitement of comic books with the adult appreciation for drama, humor and tragedy.
Each half-hour episode felt like a movie, and the voice actors who portrayed the characters were so well matched that theirs are now the ONLY voices I hear when I read the comic. Since I'm 47 and have been reading The Batman since I was a kid, that's saying something. Credit goes to the voice talents of Kevin Conroy, who pulls off the best Batman and Bruce Wayne voices I have ever heard, along with Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Trilogy) for literally BECOMING the Joker in his portrayal. Other steller voice talents belong to Efrem Zimbalist Jr., for a flawless Alfred Pennyworth, the stalwart Wayne family butler; Adrienne Barbeau as the Catwoman Selina Kyle; and Arlene Sorkin as Harley Quinn (a character created in the Animated Series, which in a switch, was then introduced into the mainstream comic book titles.)
The talented Shirley Jackson composed the memorable music, which again blended perfectly with the whole to create a true animated masterpiece.
Because this series features stories of the Dark Knight, it remains utterly amazing that the bulk of the episodes take place in Gotham at night, but manage to have amazing color and true vitality. This striking visual style was given to each character, too, making them seem more sturdy and larger than life but totally believable.
While the background of the characters is outside of the mainstream comic book continuity, the Animated Series remained true to the core of the characters' personalities and motivations more than ANY other rendition. It is so compelling that you can not only see Gotham, but feel, smell and even taste this ""fictitious"" city!
To watch these shows is to fall permanently under the spell of The Batman, the great loner detective, who was driven to crimefighting after the senseless murder of his parents that occurred in front of him during a robbery when he was a boy. This Batman is noble, tragic, funny, brilliant, obsessed, selfless, real and completely heroic, elements that were sadly missing in the many movie portrayls of the character and often missing in the comic book maintstream depictions.
If you have never seen this show, whether adult or child, you should. And for those of us who watched with utter amazement and joy during its run, there can be no more anticipated DVD release this year.",1083801600,23,3893,4.8910741301059
2059501,5,B00023E894,"Hooray! Although a better-later-than-never fan of this series, I am thrilled that, not only is a whole season coming out, but it's coming out for so much cheaper than the small-group episode DVDs of the same series did. I will feel less guilty about buying this one & having duplicate episodes. It's an animated series my whole family enjoys, from the 4-yr-old toddler (with much explanation & emphasis on the ""pretend"" nature of the cartoon) to the parents. You'd think reviewing a product not out is silly, but it's not quite so -- a few of the episodes have been released in both DVD and VHS, besides my prior viewing on the Cartoon Network of the entire series. Now if Warner Bros. will only follow through and release all the animated Batman series in like-format, I'll be well content. For which reason I'm writing a pre-view review.",1083542400,,839,4.714285714285714
2059502,5,B00023E894,"Inspired by the 1989 motion picture ""Batman"", which in turn was primarily based on the works of Batman creator Bob Kane and comics legend Frank Miller (""The Dark Knight Returns""), Batman: The Animated Series (which debuted in September 1992) unintentionally became the new standard of animation with its revolutionary visuals and phenomenal storytelling.

Helmed by visionaries Bruce W. Timm, Paul Dini and Eric Radomski, the series crafted top-notch stories and original characters (Dini's ""Harley Quinn"") that appealed to viewers of all ages, cast quality voice actors (Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Adrienne Barbeau, Bob Hastings just to name a few) and featured action that was a cut above the action shown in some of the Batman feature films.
