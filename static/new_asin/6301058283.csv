if you don't watch alot of horror flicks i think you will still enjoy this one, its creepy more than anything, and the kids are just weird and keep you wondering when and how they are going do something screwed up...
on top of that the victims in this film are stuck on the island....i liked that idea that they had to confront these weirdos..nowhere to run to nowhere to hide",1067212800,4,607,4.241379310344827
322993,4,6301058283,"A group of annoying yuppies charters a plane for a camping getaway, only to find themselves making an emergency landing on an isolated, forest-covered island. They are taken in by the only inhabitants, the rabidly religious ""Ma and Pa""  (Yvonne De Carlo and Rod Steiger), who seem trapped in a Norman Rockwellian time warp and are invited to stay the night. This proves to be every bit as unpleasant as it seems - especially after the hapless campers are introduced to the psychotic, middle-aged  ""children"" (Michael J. Pollard and Janet Wright) who both appear to be pushing 50. Before long the loopy, scripture-spouting old couple and their even loopier kids take sharp objects in hand and start killing the tourists, but wait ... one of the  ""victims"" (Sarah Torgov) is the looniest one of all and reveals her own homicidal potential when she goes completely berserk.

With a great cast, a reliable formula, and an interesting twist, how could you go wrong? The wacky family all put in great performances and the flick has some nice scares. One fo the best of the 80's slasher films. Definitely worth checking out.",1032998400,17,1117,4.863157894736842

Heres the story : Three couples are stranded on an unkown island when their plane breaks down, the island is inhabited by a strange demented family, they take shelter in the families home and what happens after is something they never expected!

The kids are over 50 and they still think that they are 12. Woody and Teddy are rough old boys (in Fanny's words) who's favorite game is cowboys and indians. This film is right in the middle of the 80's slasher films and by far just happeens to be the best. This movie gets a 6 out of 5.

Some Twenty somethings get stranded on an island inhabited by a very strange family that lives in their own world  without electricity or any other modern conveniences.

Ma, Pa and the three kids Woody,Fanny and Teddy whom are all psychotic seeing as the ""Kids"" are in there 40's and 50's yet Fanny is having a birthday and believes she's turning 12! There is some insanity all in the family like incest,a dead baby and Franny's special dollies. EEK!

Even though it's billed as a slasher there is very little slashing going on. There is however some very creepy scenes and brutal violence. It's a unique horror film that stays with you and is very memorable. It is in my opinion a classic.

The acting is perfection with it's blend of realism and it's over the top camp. If you like films like (The Unseen) or ( Tourist Trap) this will tickle your fancy!",1466380800,12,1007,4.54696132596685

323139,4,6301058283,"A mentally strained woman is taken on a plane trip with her friends to land on an island they know nothing about due to an electrical burnout on the carrier. Right off we get horrifying, sad flashbacks on the part of one of the characters. The rest do their typical goofing around until they run into a farmhouse that looks like it's from the 1970s. But that's nothing compared to the family they meet!

 The situation just turns worse as deranged family members pop up, including two very adult folks who dress and pretend like they're little kids. If that ain't enough to have you swipe this semi-gem up for a rental, the deaths are pretty cool too!! We have a pretty freaky swing scenario (who knew something as innocent as a child's play set could be so lethal??), bashing sticks, you name it.

 I'm not sure if they were trying to say something here or not along the lines of social commentary with the enhanced religion emphasis, or just showing these folks as whacked out of their minds. But whatever the point is...it worked. This family is even nuttier than mine, and that's saying a lot!

 There's some strange fairytale like lyrics that occasionally play and a twisted and possibly cheap score (Alan Parker), but it suits the dark, creepy, slightly cheesy set up. There's just this aura of insanity and dysfunction, which isn't the easiest to create. Director John Hough pulled it off beautifully.

 The ending just got nuttier and was a slight surprise. Although not mind-blowing, pretty nifty twist there, one I didn't see coming but fit perfectly.

 The cast aren't all A list actors but they work. The father is played by Rod Steiger who is always fun to watch. (He was the priest in Amityville). Yvonne De Carlo (Lily Munster fame) proves she can do more than be Herman's wife...she's truly eerie! Those are pretty much the two that stand out. Cynthia (Sarah Torgov) never made another film after this one. Fanny was played by Janet Wright and was actually frighteningly good. She pretty much was in tie with Yvonne and Rod. Michael J. Pollard, as the ""adult"" Woody, is a familiar face and fit this role well. The man convinced me he was really disturbed. The rest all did their job but none stood out too much.

 Despite all the campiness and silliness and over the top everything, emotion really does come through in parts. The situation with a certain character is actually incredibly sad. The very ending with the father is a wicked turn and sums a lot up. The commentary got muddled in somewhere if it was intended at all, but I saw this was more than just another happy-go-lucky slasher flick slapped together.

 In the end this film was made on a low budget and it does show. But you don't need big bucks to create superb atmosphere. The air was so thick with craziness I could almost breathe it in through the TV. While some of the cast didn't keep me glued, they didn't repel me either. They were there to be killed and I was glad to watch.

AMERICAN GOTHIC arrives with all of the good old-fashioned camp comedy of other 80's cult-classics like MOTEL HELL or MOTHER'S DAY, keeping its tongue placed firmly in cheek throughout all of the bloody proceedings. It perverts the values and ideals of the traditional American family in much of the same way as the aforementioned films, where breaking Ma and Pa's strict set of rules will have dire consequences. Rod Steiger and Yvonne De Carlo are perfectly cast as the batty old timers in a pair of strait-laced performances, and they are joined by Janet Wright, William Hootkins, and Michael J. Pollard as their middle-aged children who have the combined mental capacities of a 12-year-old. That doesn't stop them from killing their visitors in a variety of twisted games, however. 80's fans with a taste for the absurd will find it in AMERICAN GOTHIC!

323148,3,6301058283,"""American Gothic"" takes your typical slasher-movie premise and gives a few interesting twists on the genre.

Like ""Tourist Trap"", we have a group of young twenty-somethings going on a road trip (except here it's by small aircraft) and encountering bizarre goings-on in a remote location.

Among our unremarkable group of six, we only get backstory on the unstable Cynthia (Sarah Torgov), who's just spent some time in a mental hospital after she inadvertently left her baby in the bathtub to go take a phone call and check on her spaghetti sauce. You can guess what happens when she returns to the tub.

Anyway, the gang stumbles into a quaint cottage and are amused that it's furnishings are all from the 1920s. They then meet ""Ma and Pa"" (Yvonne DeCarlo and Rod Steiger) who agree to let the group stay until their plane is fixed. But the house rules include no smoking, no cussing and no going down in the basement. Hmmm, do you think they could be HIDING something down there?

The movie scores points for originality by introducing Ma and Pa's bizarre offspring, who despite obviously being middle-aged, seem trapped in perpetual adolescence. Fanny is a cross between a plus-size Orphan Annie and Baby Jane Hudson; Woody is a cross between a middle-aged Little Rascal and a Munchkin, and Teddy is the rotund pervert of the bunch. (It may be just me, but I got the impression Teddy was the one who may have fathered Fanny's baby--did anyone else notice the infant corpse had no arms? Genetic defect perhaps?).

Half-way in, the movie settles into standard slasher-fare, as the gang is knocked off one-by-one. Death by knitting needles, a neck-snapping, hanging, and my personal favorite, being pushed from a giant swing right off a cliff!

The performances are just about what you'd expect from the victims, and this must have been somewhat of a comedown for Steiger and DeCarlo, but they did the best with what the script gave them.

An average slasher, but rent before you buy.",1306108800,4,1983,4.831858407079646
323179,4,6301058283,"The last time I watched this, I was about 13 years old, and it really bothered me, this time, I wonder why. But recently because I've seen the Saw movies, Scream movies, certain remakes, and I Spit on your Grave, etc. it takes alot more for a movie to bother me anymore. Having just watched this for essentially the second time, I realized this movie, for it's time was pretty tame, even with all the violence. Director John Hough, best known for disney movies, took a chance with this and made it oddly effective. The main casting of Rod Steiger and Yvonne DeCarlo as the old fashioned parents of middle age murderous children, are weirdly convincing and strange. Sarah Torgov who plays Cynthia does a nice job as someone who is once again pushed to the breaking point, and becomes a vigilante after seeing her friends brutally murdered. Another departure from most horror movies is that most of the violence is implied, which to me isn't always a bad thing.
For horror fans who like charecter development over graphic violence, you may want to give this a shot. My only complaint with the DVD is no special features, and the cover from the vhs format has been thrown out, personally, I feel they should've retained it for the DVD release.",1305158400,,1240,4.640909090909091
323180,4,6301058283,"""American Gothic"" has got to be one of (if not my very favorite) films in the sub, sub category of ""family slasher."" If you look up ""over-the-top"" in the dictionary there will most assuredly be a picture of this movie because it is the height of high-camp.

Following the lead of the classic slashers of the '80s, this one also is about a group of young adults (headed by Sarah Torgov as Cynthia) that get their comeuppance when they are stranded on a deserted island with ""Ma"" (played by a wonderful Yvonne DeCarlo) and ""Pa"" (another fascinating performance by the great Rod Steiger) and their ""children.""

Janet Wright as Fannie offered up a particularly chilling viewing experience because she ran the gamut of farcical and chilling yet had a sense of oddness to her that even made her stick out in this already very eccentric family. Michael J. Pollard was also rather creepy as younger bother Woody.

I also enjoy this movie because there is somewhat of a twist ending. I am not going to give it away but it was interesting because movies of this genre usually follow a particular format yet ""American Gothic"" is well off the beaten path in this regard. And you can rest assured, that like the rest of the movie it is just as dramatic and silly.

This is a great movie for anyone that enjoys slashers or just horror in general. I did take off one star because although it's a fantastic movie, the beginning was somewhat slow-moving (it doesn't start to pick up momentum until after the first 20 minutes).

There is an almost haunting quality to ""American Gothic"" because everything is played so deadpan and serious, yet it's just too ludicrous to watch with a straight face (for example watching Fannie, a woman in her forties or fifties with a child's cloak on running around with her ""doll"" was just too hysterical for words). For a good laugh watch ""American Gothic.""",1300924800,,1875,4.66969696969697

Yvonne De Carlo (yep, Lilly Munster) and Rod Steiger (Ammityville Horror) were great as Ma and Pa, the strange pair of hyper-religious 1920s throw-backs who terrorize the young'uns. We are also introduced to the pair's twisted brood of homicidal offspring! There's a nice ending too, w/ a scorched-earth approach! Watch Sarah Torgov emerge as the evil family's worst nightmare!

323188,4,6301058283,"""American Gothic"" is one of those horror films that is smart (but could've been better) and runs head on into horror film cliches, while making them original. The movie is about a few couples; One who has recently lost their baby. They decide to get in a small, one engine plane and fly to an island. After suffering some problems, they make an emergency landing on a different island that appears to be deserted. We, the audience, know of course that it's not. We know that something is there waiting for them. After discovering a house with an odd 1920's look to it...They notice, but aren't really suspicious. We are already thinking ""You people better get out of there."" After the people own the house come home, they get in way over their heads. The people are Ma and Pa (Rod Steiger & Yvonne De Carlo), two religious freaks with slight tempers. They invite the couples to stay for a while and introduce their kids. They have three children that all appear to be between 30 and 50; The kicker is, they dress and talk like children...Oh, and they have a habit of killing off their houseguests. All the death scenes you see coming and you just to think to yourself ""My God, that character is stupid.""

But the atmosphere and mood to the film is what's creepy; The gore is actually pretty toned down. The movie has a twist towards the end involving one of the women who crash landed; It's pretty unexpected and is a well played scenario. Horror buffs, I think, will appreciate the way the film's done. Overall, it has a cheap look to it and was probably released direct-to-video (but I'm not sure if it was); But the atmosphere and everything is enough to satisfy. Steiger and De Carlo are perfect as the sadistic Ma and Pa. If you want Texas Chainsaw Massacre, go rent that. If you want creepy, check this out.

323212,4,6301058283,"This dark satire of the Religious Right in rural America demonstrates how dogmatism can erase the thin line that separates sanity from insanity.

Recovering from an emotional breakdown brought on by the bathtub drowning of her child, Cynthia (Sarah Torgov) goes on a camping trip with her husband and two other couples.  Mechanical problems strand the campers on island near Seattle, where the troupe eventually runs up against Ma & Pa (Yvonne De Carlo & Rod Steiger), the demented backwoodsy parents of three murderous but mentally infantile adults.

There are some Gein-like goodies, including implied necrophelia, as the homicidal hillbillies pick off the campers one by one, but the film really focuses more on Cynthia's descent into madness in the face of it all.  Lots of subtle humor, not the least of which is the double-entendres in the names of Ma & Pa's progeny, make AMERICAN GOTHIC a fun way to waste a few hours. And over-the-top performances strengthen the entertainment value, especially those of Steiger, De Carlo, and Michael J. Pollard (who portrays Teddy, one of the psycho sons). Targov is also wonderfully whacko when her character, Cynthia, finally loses all ties with reality.

The DVD from Trinity Home Entertainment offers the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  The transfer looks a bit grainy at times but is definitely watchable.  Alas, the disc contains no bonus features, yet it's still worth the very reasonable price of admission.",1127779200,19,1473,5.1125

323214,3,6301058283,"Today, the plot of a bunch of young people who accidently stroll into an area where they don't belong and encounter a murderous family is only too common.  We've had literally dozens of examples of this story over the past few years.  But in 1988 it was still somewhat of an original concept and it's the campiness that makes American Gothic rise a bit above others of it's ilk.

In this one, a group of young twenty-somethings travels to an island in the pacific northwest and there they meet Ma(Yvonne DeCarlo from the Munsters) and Pa (Rod Steiger), straight out of the early American farmland.  Ma & Pa are a bit weird in their stoic dress and mannerisms, but they seem nice enough as they offer the hospitality of their little home to the young couples.  Soon the family turns out to be less than normal as they have three ""kids"" who are all middled-aged but who still act like little kids, including the ever-wacky Michael J. Pollard who specializes in these sort of bizarre roles.  Well they soon go on a murderous rampage, killing their young guests.  One scene features one of the guests in a swing which sways back and forth over a high cliff as one of the boys cuts the swing sending them falling to their death.

DeCarlo and Steiger play their roles in wondferfully campy style and it's hard to be scared because these two veterans seem so bizarrely out of place in the film.  The children are all played insanely to the hilt, especially Janet Wright as Fanny.  All in all not a bad film.",1123804800,,1500,4.501845018450185

323217,3,6301058283,"American Gothic is a slice of 80's slasher cheese that throws all horror clichs into a pot of boiling stew and offers no explanation for the absurdities shown on screen.  Such as why would someone let a couple of lunatics push them on a swing at the edge of a rocky cliff?  Why would a deeply religious god worshipper all of a sudden pledge to Satan when things are not going his way? After firing a gun at a maniac pursuing her, why would a woman drop the gun to the floor and not bother picking it up before running away?  In the midst of watching this flick, it didn't take me long to come to the realization that the filmmakers were simply throwing in every clich in the book in order to make somewhat of a horror/comedy hybrid, instead of a straight slasher film.
3 Seattle couples board a private plane en route to Jackson Island, a resort in the pacific northwest intended for rich yuppie types.  During the trip, the plane's engine sputters and the pilot is forced to land on another island short of their destination.  The island appears to be deserted at first, but upon further exploration, the travelers stumble upon an old cabin in the middle of the woods.  The inhabitants of the cabin turn out to be an old, deeply religious couple that go by the name of ""Ma"" and ""Pa"".  Also inhabiting their house are their three deranged children, all of them who appear to be at least in their forties but who don't act a year older than 10.  Ma and Pa appear at first very kind, inviting the travelers for dinner and to stay the night.  The travelers soon find out that there is a great price for this hospitality however, as Ma and Pa's ""children"" turn out to have an insatiable appetite for murder.
American Gothic doesn't waste any time getting started, as the travelers land on the island only about ten minutes into the movie.  Once the first murder occurs, the pace flies by as some of the travelers get dispatched with ridiculous ease.  From then on the movie turns into a revenge flick as the sole survivor turns the table on the murderous inbred family.  Most of the murders sadly happen off screen and there is not much in the matter of grue (which is not unusual with 80's slasher fare).  Yes, there is a small amount of blood but we only get to see it after the murder, once the victim is lying dead on the ground.  One of the most obvious flaws in the movie is that we're never sure when Cynthia, one of the travelers recently released from a psych ward, is sane or not.  Most scenes with her in it left me wondering whether she had become totally insane and joined the ranks of Ma and Pa's family or if she was simply playing along so she could escape.  It would be nice to know but instead the viewer is left guessing.
I found American Gothic effectively chilling but not for the obvious reasons.  There are no jumps or surprises or traditional horror movie scares.  The spookiest part is watching so many characters fall into utter depths of insanity.  The idea of parents raising their children on a deserted island their entire lives and never letting them leave in fear that they may be ""contaminated by the outside world"", all in the name of religious blasphemy, is something I found to be quite chilling.  The acting was also surprisingly effective, especially the over-the-top performance of ""Pa"", played by Rod Steiger and by Fannie of the 3 ""children"".  I don't imagine it's easy playing a 40-something with the mentality of a murderous 10 year old and trying to keep a straight face through it all.  American Gothic is a decent film for those looking for a stylistic 80's slasher with great scenery and a barrel of laughs both intentional and unintentional.",1073347200,22,3685,4.501501501501502
