8138572,3,B000HD19AA,Awesome deal and good show but it's a sketchy publishing seeing as there is an aol address on the screen and subtitles (sometimes just random letters and symbols) that don't match and you cannot turn off.,1450051200,,204,4.694444444444445

8138575,5,B000HD19AA,I started watching Nip-Tuck from the beginning.  I love Nip Tuck; with the great cast and the great stories.  I bought myself Seasons 1 thru 4 and can't wait to buy Season 5.  This show should go down in the record books as one of the best mini-shows on TV.  If you like blood and alot of sex scenes than this is your show.  I do recommend that you buy this great set!!,1205712000,,369,4.0
8138576,5,B000HD19AA,"I truly fell in love with the television series, and am currently deployed in Iraq, so I purchased all 3 seasons to watch while here, and some other soldiers have also gotten hooked. I can't wait to get the complete 4th season. Please let me know when it will be released, as I will pre-order it.

Thanks",1168819200,,304,4.333333333333333
8138577,5,B000HD19AA,"You gotta love Nip Tuck.  My girlfriend and I got into it part of the way through the 4th season because Bubba the Love Sponge always talked about it on his show on Sirius, Howard 101.  We have been hooked since.  I bought her the first 3 seasons for Christmas.  Gotta love the T & A!!!",1168473600,,286,4.053571428571429
8138578,5,B000HD19AA,"I'm currently deployed in Iraq and I ordered the complete first three seasons of Nip/Tuck because I missed watching it at home. Every time I had some free time I would be watching in in my room. If I was on the road I would use my Ipod or portable DVD it's addictive, I can't wait for season four. Amazon got it to me exactly when they said they would the price was better than best buy, wal-mart and target. I proberbly will be buying most of my DVD's from Amazon.com from now on.
