32412,4,0780627822,"A cross between Lawrence humor and Hitchcock suspence.  Martin plays the ""playa"" and uses his comedic style to provide the humor.  This time there is less of the absurbed humor than in some of his previous movies.  The Hithcock suspense is Lynne Whitfield's character.  How many ways will she make the man pay and in the end to what degree does the playa learn his lesson.  For the Martin Lawrence fan there is no disappointment. Maybe his best to date.",1100995200,3,453,4.6125
32413,5,0780627822,"I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS PRETTY GOOD . THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT LYNN WHITFIELD HAVING A FATAL ATTRACTION FOR MARTIN LAWRENCE  I LIKED IT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. BOBBY BROWN CO-STARRED IN THIS MOVIE ALONGSIDE MARTIN LAWRENCE I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT CONTAINS, DRAMA, ACTION,AND SUSPENSE ALSO, LYNN DID A ATERIFFIC ACTING JOB

SHE PLAYED HER ROLE VERY WELL. FIVE THUMBS WAY UP!!!!!!",1095552000,7,372,4.621212121212121
32414,4,0780627822,This is funny.  Martin Lawrence is hilarious.  I loved when his car windows were broken in front of the police station.  How funny.,1088467200,,131,4.608695652173913
32415,2,0780627822,"Well, I think Martin Lawrence is a funny actor. I won't compare him to an under rated version of Eddie Murphy like most people do, since I don't think he is. He has his own style, his own way to act etc...and the mere fact that they both star in comedy movies is not that relevant to me.
Anyway I knew this movie would be slightly different from what Lawrence has done in the past. This time it would be a blending of comedy and thriller, something more personal, maybe because he wrote the screenplay and directed the movie. So I watched it trying to stay away from any prejudices and to enjoy it for what it is. I found the movie very uneven. The real plot took way too long to come up. Indeed, the first part trying to settle Lawrence's character and personality is way too long compared to the time left to the plot development and realization, which obviously leads to shortcuts and great haste when it comes to the real story. The goal of the movie, the real aim is therefore not reached entirely, for the comedy part of the movie maybe stole a lead over the drama or thriller part. It was indisputably interesting to try catching another 'usually hidden' side of Martin Lawrence, as a director, a writer trying to deal with something different from what he usually does, but this time it was not that big of a success. Let's not be too harsh there for it may be new to him, and I'm sure we'll see more from him in that field very soon, but I would not rank this movie as a must-see one. I watched it cause I really wanted to discover something new about Lawrence, and in a way I saw some good first steps, but somehow the intention outmatched the means and the way Lawrence handled the making and construction of his work.
But as you can see, this is not a 'Don't go watch this movie' kind of message, it is just a personal view of it. You should try this movie anyway, cause you'll see or at least guess what Martin Lawrence could do with a little more experience and writing discipline.",1002585600,3,1995,4.308510638297872
32416,5,0780627822,"Darnell Wright {Lawrence}, T {Bobby Brown}, and Brandi Web {Whitfield} are too much!  Lawrence plays a successful womanizer who meets Web and pursues her to no end.  Wright and T decide that if Wright wants to bed Web, he'll have to tell her that he loves her {which is against the ""player rules."") When Web's birthday comes around, and Wright doesn't show up, {he opts to spend time with Air Force cutie, Mia, {played by Regina King.}, it's ON from there! This movie is hilarious from start to finish: check out Faizon Love, Miguel Nunez, and Della Reese in their humor filled performances.

32417,4,0780627822,"Mixing the formula from Eddie Murphy's ""Boomerang"" (a player gets played) and Michael Douglas' ""Fatal Attraction"" (guy is stalked by heartsick ex-lover) plays well here, but I thought the subject matter was a bit too heavy to be considered a comedy, even a dark one, especially during the climax of the movie.

32470,2,0780627822,"Sad to say, I liked this movie when I saw it in the 90's, Martin Lawrence was hot off of his TV series ""Martin"" and Bad Boys was a hit, the film was filled with sad references that were popular back in 95'-96' . The story was a fatal attraction, but supposedly a comedy. Problem is, it doesn't hold up 20 years later and most of it was annoying. I hadn't seen it in a very long time and decided to buy it again. Regina King was alright, and Lynn Whitfield does a fine job as the jilted (after provoked) unstable independent lady with her back story, the problem is Martin Lawrence, who also directed the film.. The problem is the corny old ghetto dialogue comin' out of Lawrence and Brown's mouths every time they had to speak.. They come off as complete cheese balls, and Lynn's character had the right idea from the very beginning not to get involved with Lawrence. Nothing he said or did was funny or amusing..and he had the charm of a street beggar lookin' to wash your windshield.. The ending was minimal, cheap and abrupt, and it ends just like a made for TV movie.. No real substance in any of this. The only cool moment was seeing Tracey Morgan in an early bit role as a bartender in, what had to be the most boring and pretentious small club in the 90's.. There's a thin line between entertainment and crap.",1401926400,,1316,4.331983805668016

32501,5,0780627822,"I wouldn't mind watching this movie again and again, because it is Martin Lawrence at his theatrical best. Not as good as ""Bad Boys,"" but he did some stellar acting in Bad Boys, so this movie role was really an excellent choice for him.

It is told in reverse chronology and pops like a rubber band in that he (Darnell, played by Lawrence) starts telling his story close to the resolution, pulls you back to the beginning like a rubber band, builds the tension, the rubber band gets tighter and tighter and just when it couldn't possibly get any worse - POP!!

He lets the rubber band go and it flies through the air, landing you right back at the starting point before it resolves only moments later.

My favorite lines in the movie [paraphrased]:

""One night of passion can lead to a lifetime of heartache.""

""We're not your babies, your mama's ... we don't need your money or your D**&.""

""I sure hope baby lands on her feet. They might be able to fix the hole in her head, but what about the one in her heart.""

and

""Never say the word 'love' unless you mean it.""

The movie had a very good theme, even though the song it originated from was more about a 'cheating man with a woman at home' type of player than it was a 'single and free playa-player'. However, Lawrence puts a heckuva twist on the theme of the song, which is about thin lines or how fast love can turn into hate given the right set of circumstances.

More than a combination of Boomerang and Fatal Attraction, ""Thin Line"" goes deeper into the woman's feelings and brings Brandi Webb in as a more sympathetic character than the others.

She is hardcore, but not so hardcore that most women won't understand where she is coming from and what made her snap. Pop. You end up feeling sorry for her, because Darnell did play her really wrong; but, she was already a murderess on the edge and he just messed with the wrong one.

She killed her husband after catching him in her own home cheating; but she made the death look like an accident by dropping a plugged in juice-filled radio in the tub with him.

It had the feel of the classic ""Okay I forgive you..."". NOT.

There was Al Green invited to a breakfast of hot grits that ended up giving him third degree burns (real life); there was, in the fictional world, Mrs Charles McCarter kicking the ""sh"" out of her disabled husband--which he deserved for all he had put her through; there was Miss Celie holding a carving knife at the throat of Mr. _______ during Thanksgiving dinner; and there was another one of Tyler Perry's characters throwing the pot of hot grits and simultaneously swinging with a frying pan.

Hit and swat, hit and swat ...

Anyway, Thin Line is worth a watch if you've never seen it. It is a very well-told twice-told tale, not so much mystery-intriguing as it is raw with the thunderclap of emotions.

32514,3,0780627822,"I saw this movie when it originally came out and thought it was a good movie. Unlike many I feel Martin Lawrence is best doing standup, as an example in his TV show Martin he was notable for slapstick and urban shtick, but the efforts of Tisha Campbell, and the rest of the cast made the show a classic.  My opinion is the same for this movie, Martin puts in a cliched, effort that shows he was more full of himself than his character or his acting talent suggests. Luckily he surrounded himself with a strong supporting cast including a sober Bobby Brown, who may have had some acting chops back then! If you consider the wonderful mix of the iconic Della Reese whose has entertained us since the 50's and 60's, Lynn whitfield who is no doubt one of our most unheralded stars since the 70's (Josephine Baker story) and Regina king who has shown her talent and range from TV and now to movies and no doubt will be entertaining us for a long time and of course Roger Mosely who is always solid this could be considered an all star cast. THE STORY LINE is ok, I would love to have seen someone else play a smooth debonair young entrepenuer ladies man who wins over an obviously older, more refined, (and deranged) wealthy woman. The pacing and interplay between characters was good and enjoyable until Lynn Whitfield's character basically took over the last 3rd of the movie! Her portrayal early was right on as sexy, above it all with a hint of something odd about her. As the movie progressed and it became clear Martin's character was way over his head as Ms Whitfield basically took over with a riveting portrayal as the sicko dangerous jilted woman, who exuded sexy throughout, hell in my opinion she was more malevolent then Glen Close. I agree this movie really isn't that funny (are any of Martin's movies funny?) but it is an enjoyable suspense movie thanks to Lynn whitfield performance and support from the rest of the cast. Put an real actor in this movie like Bokeem Woodbine or Allan Payne and this would have been something!",1215043200,,2037,4.5353260869565215
32515,5,0780627822,"I often go back to watching this movie every now and then because I really do like it.  It's not Oscar material for sure, but it's good and enjoyable and almost anything that Martin Lawrence is in, is great.  He's funny and yet in this, you can see he's got a more serious side too.  I do agree with some other reviewers that it is a semi cross between Fatal Attraction and Boomerang.  There are moments of comedy and moments of insanity with the female lead.  Darnell meets Brandi outside his club, Chocolate City, and she looks like she has it all.  Limo driver, fine crib in Malibu, good paying job, but that's only the surface.
He can't say he wasn't warned.  His mother (Della Reese) said near the start that there is a fine line between love and hate, and also Brandi (Lynn Whitfield) told Darnell that it wouldn't be a good thing if she were hurt and she also told him in bed for their first time, that she'd killed her husband because he'd been abusive.  He should have heard warning bells then, but didn't.
I love watching this; it's funny in parts and also fun watching Brandi go off the deep end.  I love the music throughout the movie and if you are a fan of Black cinema, then check it out.  It's an old favourite of mine and really enjoy it.",1212192000,21,1255,4.302127659574468

32517,5,0780627822,"I hadn't seen this movie in 10 years until this past weekend when it resurfaced on TV -- whew!!! what a welcomed blast from the past.

Martin Lawrence was still in his heyday as a comedian in this movie's 1996 release.

A sober Bobby Brown delivers an entertaining performance as Martin's pseudo sidekick, Regina King plays a believable ""it girl"" role and Lynn Whitfield totally delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as a woman scorned and determined to make her man pay for all the heartache that comes from lies and deception.

This is one of those twist-of-fate movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to ""get some"" and move on.

The story is easy to follow.

There's tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes.

The movie moves along at a great pace -- you won't go to sleep on this!

For anyone -- male or female -- who's ever had an ""adventure in dating"" with a nut you later question why you ever dated, this movie's for you.

As the movie's theme song says, ""The sweetest woman in the world could (also) be the meanest woman in the world/Did you make her that way?""

You're just gonna have to watch this movie to ""get it.""",1153267200,5,1154,4.590243902439024
32518,4,0780627822,"""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"" stars Martin Lawrence, Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown and Della Reese.  This is easily one of my favorite movies; I often watch it when I'm feeling depressed because it eases my mood and reminds me that even though we may face hard times, someone is always going through something worse than you.

 The movie is a about a player (womanizer) named Darnell who is confident that he can get any woman he wants.  He was able to get women easily, because he was charming and co-owner of a hot club in town, so he was looking for a challenge.  He found that challenge in Brandy Webb. Brandy is not your average female.  She is high maintenance and rich.  She does not deal with men like Darnell, for they are mid-class players.  Darnell wants Brandy badly and goes through a lot to get her.  While he is chasing Brandy, though, his old flame Mia is back in town from the Army.  Darnell still has feelings for, but mind you, he is still chasing Brandy, and Mia is dating a well to do man.  Darnell finally is able to get a date with Brandy, and after spending lots of time with her, he accomplishes his goal and ""hits it"".  After he hits it, he loses interest in Brandy and pursues Mia.  However, Brandy is not going to let Darnell go that easily.  She does all she can to get revenge on Darnell.  The whole while Darnell's mother is warning him about playing women, but he always brushes her off.  In the end, Darnell CERTAINLY learns a lesson.

 I absolutely love this movie.  The comedic performance is wonderful.  I love the plot.  I have never seen a black movie with this type of plot, so it was different.  Martin Lawrence showed innovation in creating this movie.  It is also neat that he named this movie after the song entitled ""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"".  The song and movie are about the same subject: ""The sweetest woman in the world can be the meanest woman in the world, if you make her that way"".  This is a line from the song.

 I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some drama.",1129852800,5,2069,4.362204724409449
