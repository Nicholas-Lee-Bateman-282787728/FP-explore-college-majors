8740460,3,B017S3QG0Y,"He had some amusing moments when he performed some impersonations, but I never so much as chuckled.  I found it so mediocre that it didn't really register any positive or negative feelings.  This would be something to have on as background noise while you performed other things around the house.",1495584000,,296,4.9
8740461,2,B017S3QG0Y,"Warning - another comedian with a small child, and wow, isn't the now the center of the world? None of your fans like your for having spawned, they don't care. Why does every comedian that becomes a parent do this drivel? Parenthood = comedian sharpness death. Sigh. Watch old Jay, this is same old same old ""I'm a day, ain't my spawn the best?""",1493424000,3,345,4.40625
8740462,5,B017S3QG0Y,"Some of these reviews must be haters, I don't get, it baffles me, or maybe they did not watch the whole special or maybe they just don't get how comedy works. This is a smart and well thought out special, the call-backs are great with the flip flops, and lessons in irony. I love it when a comedian ties it all back in with a great payoff at the end. Love Jay, he makes me laugh. And is that not what comedy is about, the laughs???",1490572800,,431,4.023255813953488
