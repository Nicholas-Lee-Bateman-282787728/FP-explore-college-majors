7432602,2,B015DFI986,"Thought provoking portrayal of this part of chess history, but ultimately historical inaccuracies and overhyped performances - falls flat

This movie ultimately dulls the senses. Full disclosure  I am a strong chess player (USCF 1990) drawn into tournament chess by the Fischer boom.

Maguire's performance, praised by most critics, is over the top, and this is compounded by the enervating score.
It should be acknowledged that portraying an historical figure, especially one who has been filmed, is difficult. But Anthony Hopkins performance in Nixon was excellent even though he did not resemble the man himself. Maguires performance draws you in, and it is certainly fun to watch him shout Im coming for you to Liev Schreibers Spassky, who is on a beach surrounded by a bunch of presumably KGB men in dark suits. Funny images abound!
Leaving aside the thorny question of whether Bobby was doing things like this during this time period, after a while, watching Maguire try to disassemble phones to the beat of a pounding score feels a bit, well, exhausting.
Maguire just does not seem anything like what Fischer was like in public. Watching Bobbys Dick Cavett he comes across as somewhat self effacing and arrogant at the same time. There is no channeling of the circa 1970 suit wearing Bobbys politeness going on here.
Issue 2. Historical inaccuracies.
Inaccuracies and composite scenes certainly have their place. But these errors we so extreme, and so calculated by the movie maker, that they made me wonder why they made a movie about chess in the first place. Bobby Fischer was a chess player, not a cold warrior. The movie begins with Based on a True Story, something which made me laugh uncomfortably. Little did I know that using this old phrase was going to be cover for glaring inaccuracies!  Bobby did not resign game 1 right after he captured the bishop on h2, but a full 25 (!) moves later, after missing at least one drawing continuation. So the images of him scrunching up his face in despair seconds after he makes the move, and then resigning, is,  begging the readers indulgence, an insult to the intelligence of anyone who knows anything about the 1972 world. And , dare I say it, even insulting to Mr. Fischers memory  sure, he was nervous, but could he play THAT badly? This moment alone made me want to write a letter to the filmmakers and say you spent millions to make a big budget film about an obscure topic like chess, why dumb it down this much? Why not take an extra five or ten seconds to show that there was a longer continuation? Did you have to dumb it down this much? 

Other inaccuracies are a bit more forgiveable:

The 1962 Interzonal, which took place in Stockholm, Sweden, was a separate tournament from the Olympiad, which took place in Varna, Bulgaria.
The 6th game was not the decisive game of the match, the moves were not unprecedented, although they got correct that Fischers use of the Queens gambit was. Nor was it the greatest chess game ever played.

The biggest issue of the movie was that the filmmakers , evidently in an attempt to open out the movie, make match a proxy for the cold war. Fischers attorney has too much screen time, the music is oppressive, and the grainy footage of news commentators of the period gets old fast. There was enough drama in Fischer's life and rise to the top of the chess world that it might not have been necessary to sensationalize it. But then the movie might not have been made.",1442880000,9,3471,4.712871287128713
7432603,5,B015DFI986,"Just saw this movie for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I became fascinated with chess and began playing about 5 years before the 1972 world championship while in middle school, and was familiar with Fischer's accomplishments prior to then, so I literally lived and breathed Fischers run to the championship in addition to the world title match. I was disappointed that the movie did not cover the amazing run to the title, however this is a movie for entertainment value in addition to trying keep it under two hours and be as historically accurate as possible, so I can forgive that.  Although they were a little over the top on the paranoia during this time, Fischer & Spasskys builds not being quite right, and a few other minor fallacies (Paul Morphys cause of death being one), overall I think the movie was very well done. It definitely captured the tragedy of the Bobby Fischer,  post title match, at the end of the movie.  I have read enough reviews on this movie that show disappointment in the clips at the end of the real Fischer and state this makes Bobby look bad.  I disagree, as for me it just brought home the tragedy of mental illness and does not detract at all from his accomplishments or his brilliance over the chess board.  If anything it makes me feel even more compassionate and forgiving of his behavior and statements he made in later life.  I have been a fan of Robert James Fischer since I started  playing the game and know a majority his games by heart. Nothing in this movie changed my opinion of that, and if anything just makes me appreciate even more being able to live in the same era and witness his accomplishments firsthand. RIP Bobby.",1521936000,,1687,4.6033333333333335

7432608,5,B015DFI986,"This is a brilliantly cast movie.  Tobey Maguire's Bobby Fisher is very believable, even if Fisher as a person is very unlikable.

The focus in the movie is Fisher being the Soviet player Spassky and winning the world chess championship.  As a child he's already showing a talent for the game and gets early training.  Fisher as a boy knows he wants to be the best and chess becomes his one obsession.  But as he ages and is thrown into the limelight, we see how he becomes paranoid to the point of being unreasonable in his demands.

Both Fisher and Spassky are pawns during the height of the Cold War.  Fisher can only take so much of the pressure.  Spassky seems to be aware of some of the subliminal tactics that are used to intimidate Fisher or to make him lose his concentration.  While I realize this is a movie, I have to wonder how accurate these tactics are in the world of chess.

Acting and directing are both above par.  This is one of Maguire's better roles as he seems to take on roles that promote the quiet type.  Not this time.  He goes all out in depicting paranoia and rage, qualities that defined Fisher at the height of his career.  Scenes are tense throughout the entire movie.",1508716800,,1200,4.420091324200913

7432611,3,B015DFI986,"PAWN SACRIFICE was an interesting movie that told a good story.  I was never bored.  But I was also never gripped.  The story of Bobby Fischer, and in particular, his rise to world champion chess player via an epic competition with Russian Boris Spassky, is amazing.  I was too young at the time to have any real memories of it now, but I can only image, at the height of the Cold War, how this battle must have resonated with Americans (and Soviets).

But I found the approach to tell us the story was clunky and frustrating.  First of all, depicting chess on screen isn't the easiest task (at least trying to make it exciting is)...so the approach the film often uses is to have the characters played by Michael Stuhlberg (Fischer's ""agent"") and Peter Sarsgard (a priest who used to be a chess champion, and is now Fischer's ""sparring partner"") explain to each other, and thus the viewer, what is happening and why it's amazing.  We never feel the amazement ourselves...we have to see THEM being amazed and by extenstion try to feel amazed.  So, the chess itself is tricky.  And then, so is the character of Bobby Fischer.  If this were a fiction story, I'd say Fischer's character is unbelievable and immensely unlikable.  I guess because it's a true story, I BELIEVE the character, but I dislike him all the more.  He a massive egoist with no redeeming qualities.  He plays great chess, but he treats EVERYONE around him with disdain or worse.  He makes insane demands because he can.  He's is also a paranoid, driven by demons that have made him crazy (to be blunt).  Frankly, at almost no time do we see the ""human"" in Fischer, the guy we can relate to.  He's a terribly unsympathetic character...yet I think we're meant to feel sorry for how the strains for his genius have driven  him mad.  I just want someone to beat the guy up!  Tobey Maquire seems to do a fair job with the role (actually, everyone is perfectly fine), but the script doesn't give him a chance to earn our caring or sympathy.  It dwells so heavily on his peculiarities.

Also, here's a nitpick.  I watched the blu-ray of this film and the detail is so fine, I could readily see the makeup on the actors, Maquire in particular.  He looked like a guy smeared with inexpensive base makeup preparatory to going out on stage.  Or maybe a guy with a bad spray-on tan.  It was distracting!

The film is quite low budget.  Old newsreel footage does a lot of the plot movement for us, rather than other, less clumsy but more expensive solutions.  Technically the film is unimaginative.

I know my gripes sound like the film is a failure, but it is still worth watching.  The performances are solid, if not quite award caliber.  And the amazing story is pretty compelling.  The raw material is so good, even this somewhat flat-footed telling can't take away from the sheer ""you've got to be kidding me"" of it.  Worth a look.",1504051200,,2892,4.551456310679612

7432670,5,B015DFI986,"When I was in my early 20s, I was touring Europe and the talk everywhere by Europeans was the intense chess confrontation between Fisher and the Russians in Iceland, exemplified by Spassky. Everyone was chuckling over Fisher's antics and Spassky's apparent befuddlement at Bobby's behavior, thinking that the latter was messing with the Russian's head. They jokingly referred to Fisher as being a crazy guy and were rooting for him. What nobody knew at the time, except for a handful of individuals was that Fisher was really crazy, that his antics and demands were not psychological warfare. This secret came to light many years thereafter.

The Soviets' philosophy was that if they excelled at chess and at the Olympics, even through cheating, then it proved that Marxist totalitarianism was superior to a Western decadent democracy, so the State funded chessplayers (and athletes) and gave them special treatment, unlike the Western countries. This fact is emphasized in the film.

Unfortunately, although Liev Schreiber does a convincing and likeable Spassky, the film doesn't show that he was a pretty decent guy, far from the usual mindless apparatchik. At a chess tournament against the Czechoslovakian players shortly after the invasion of their country, he shook their hands even though they wore black armbands as a sign of mourning, something that the Soviet authorities got angry about. Not also shown was that after Spassky lost the match and returned home, he was hassled at the Moscow airport.

7432697,4,B015DFI986,"A good movie. It's difficult to portray all the complexities of a troubled genius like Bobby Fisher, but Liev Shrieber and Toby Maguire do admirable jobs of portraying the two rivals who later became friends. The whole political atmosphere and the paranoia of Fisher and his Jew-hating and xenophobia are hard to understand unless you are familiar with both the history of the times and what Fisher actually did. He won the world championship, for instance, and then never defended it and essentially hid from the world until 20 years later when he played an illegal rematch with Spassky. He then hid from the legal authorities, gave up his US citizenship, married a Japanese woman, was granted citizenship in Iceland and died lonely and bitter without leaving a will. His legacy and his fortune are still being debated today. You need to read a biography of Fisher after watching this movie to put it into context.",1477612800,,915,4.871794871794871

Nevertheless, this is a good account for this historical moment for the game of chess, when its importance went beyond the 64 squares on the board and went into the Cold war conflict. The movie has its flaws which can annoy the most avid chess enthusiast (such as assuming that Spassky was the world champion in  1966, or that someone playing with the white pieces had chosen the Sicilian defense, etc..), but it is more a movie about the political importance of the event, then the technical details surrounding it.",1477267200,,583,4.83

7432704,5,B015DFI986,"For much of its runtime, watching ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a grueling experience. Young Bobby Fischer is growing up fearing being spied on by government agents. His mother, Regina, (Robin Weigart) is a communist living in Cold War era Brooklyn. Bobby escapes from what looks like a loveless childhood and a chaotic home life by focusing on chess.

Regina takes Bobby to Carmine Nigro (Conrad Pia) a teacher who greets Bobby by telling him that chess is a religion that takes anyone regardless of nation or creed. One hopes that this kindly man will serve as a ray of light in Bobby's life, but Bobby behaves as if he is autistic. He makes little eye contact and focuses only on the board, shutting out his opponent and his mother and sister who must stand and watch as he spends hours on his first chess match with a near master. Once young Bobby loses to Nigro, he refuses to shake hands, cries silently, and icily demands another game.

The real Bobby Fischer was noticeably tall and slim with very striking facial features: piercing eyes, prominent nose, large, curved lips and a sprinkling of facial moles. Tobey Maguire is short and slight, with refined features, darker hair and no moles. Fischer was from Brooklyn and he lacked a formal education. He dropped out of high school. He talked like an uneducated Brooklynite who happens to be a headline-making genius; he had a lot of attitude. Maguire is from California and he never really captures Fischer's unique voice or inflection.

The film picks up with the arrival of three characters played by brilliant actors: Michael Stahlbarg as Paul Marshall, a sort of fixer / hand-holder, Peter Sarsgaard as Father William Lombardy, a chess master, and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky. These three actors are superb, and each has a moment on screen that absolutely took my breath away.

Marshall is a long suffering lawyer who prods Fischer to go to Iceland to take on Boris Spassky and become the new world champion. Lombardy is the closest thing Fischer has to a friend. He serves as Fischer's second.

Bobby tears apart hotel rooms seeking hidden microphones; perhaps the Russians, the CIA, or the conspiratorial Jews are spying on him. Bobby runs from journalists' cameras and the fans who want to grab and kiss him. Bobby cracks when he hears spectators cough or when he can smell their breath. He demands more money, special chairs, different rooms, quieter cameras. Though Jewish, he listens to tapes that convince him that Jews are evil people taking over the world.

All this is really hard to watch. It's especially hard to watch for anyone who remembers the Fischer-Spassky match. Bobby Fischer was an incredibly gifted man. He was world famous. After his match, he could have made millions and enjoyed a cushioned retirement. Instead he trusted the wrong people, became a raving lunatic Jewish anti-Semite and a member of a cult he would later denounce, denounced America, cheered 9-11, spat on documents, broke laws, became an exile, and, after refusing necessary medical treatment, died entirely too young and unnecessarily. His ironic, poignant last words, they say, were, ""Nothing is as healing as human touch.""

You can't watch this movie and not wish that somebody had done something to help this man. You can't not wonder, what was wrong with him? Was it the bad relationship with his mother? His lack of a father? His illegitimacy? Was he schizophrenic or autistic? Or is that he was treated like a star and did not receive, from others, the kind of feedback that forms character? A combination of all of these factors? Because Bobby Fischer is a commodity, even in death, we will never know.

In the film, Paul Marshall, the more practical and earthbound of Bobby's advisors, suggests taking him to a psychiatrist. Father Lombardy responds that chess is a rabbit hole. He mentions the hundreds of millions of moves that chess masters must take into consideration. He says that taking Bobby to a psychiatrist would be like pouring concrete down a holy well. The implication is that Bobby's chess genius is inextricably tied to his mental illness.

Lombardy cites Paul Morphy, a chess genius who could not succeed at conventional life. But look at Boris Spassky. He is still alive and no one suggests that he is mentally ill. Maybe a mentally healthy Bobby would have been an even better chess player.

Liev Schreiber, in the commentary, says that chess masters must constantly predict their opponent's attacks, and that doing so contributes to paranoia. Perhaps so.

Although I found the film hard to watch, the performances by the leads were so profoundly rewarding that they lifted me up in awe and made me cry. I don't know how Liev Schreiber did it, but he perfectly channeled a Soviet man from the 70s. I know because I was there in the 70s. Michael Stahlberg utterly inhabits his part, a chain smoking, sweaty palmed, tireless enabler who takes every abuse from Bobby and never stops trying to push him forward. Peter Sarsgaard is just simply superb, in every scene, from praying the rosary on his knees to the moment when dawn breaks on his face as Bobby starts winning. Tobey Maguire has a moment that is so powerful it gave me chills. He is beating Spassky. He is in his element. It is his bliss. See the movie for that moment, one I watched over and over again.",1477008000,,5339,4.817685589519651

7432723,4,B015DFI986,"Some chess opening and historical inaccuracies, e.g., Boris Spassky WASN'T the World Chess Champion at the time Bobby Fischer competed in the Second Piatigorsky Cup in Los Angeles; Tigran Petrosian was. I believe there was also a scene in which two chess commentators express surprise that Fischer, playing the white pieces, has abandoned ""the Sicilian!"" Fischer was fantastic at playing the Sicilian, but the name of the Defence depends upon BLACK responding to WHITE's 1.e4; the commentators' remark makes no sense, as Fischer had only made one white move, and his opponent, Spassky, hadn't even moved yet! Nevertheless, the acting was good, I really liked Liev Schreiber as Spassky, and the actor who played Fr. William Lombardy was excellent. Tobey McGuire had a tough role to play, as Fischer, given the difficulties of playing a paranoid, twisted chess genius! And I think he turned in a fine performance.

I think the hidden gem of the film would be Sarsgaard and his performance, He's really underrated as an actor. I don't think they used Schreiber to the best of his abilities either. Maguire gives his best performance in years and proves to us all why he's worth watching in the first place.

As a whole, I really enjoyed the movie. I think they got Fischer's descent into paranoia and his mental illness just right but I think they down played how incredibly racist he really was and that was an almost equal part of his personality (along with the mental illness).

7432788,5,B015DFI986,"I found this movie totally engrossing. Bobby Fischer is a fascinating figure even if you aren't that knowledgable about chess. The prestige of an American chess champion during the cold war was huge and Fischer, while clearly kind of crazy, commanded a lot of respect. I am not a huge Toby Maguire fan, but his performance was totally convincing. I read Bobby Fischer's book on winning at chess a long time ago and the movie captures the kind of manic energy that Fischer put into his game philosophy. The later decline of Bobby Fischer was really sad and he makes a brief appearance near the end, but all through the movie the sense of his edginess was driving toward that cliff.

7432791,4,B015DFI986,Really liked that the movie held to the basic story line without unnecessary embellishment. Tobey Maguire is good; I have yet to see anything from Liev Schreiber that i didn't like -- a very underrated actor.,1470787200,,208,4.805555555555555
7432792,5,B015DFI986,"I have to say first that I have no idea how accurate this movie captures Bobby Fisher's life, but as a story for a movie it Is first rate. The movie depicts a rather strange person driven by his need to succeed in winning chess games. Interesting relationships develop along the way and tension builds as we see the destructive nature of oppression.
I can add another movie that has chess as a background theme.  ""Queen to Play"" with Kelvin Kline is a French movie about a middle age French women who learns chess and again becomes obsessed about playing well. This one has none of the severe  psychological problems depicted in Pawn Sacrifice and in fact is very lighthearted in nature. I can not remember the name of the French actress in the lead, but she is just as good an actor as Mr. Lien and is a joy to watch.",1470787200,,818,4.375

7432874,3,B015DFI986,"Great story potential, but movie didn't really pull me into it.  Chess - and chess movies -  are very hard to make exciting to audiences.  Instead, the strong performances from the actors and characters need to make the movie.  However, we didn't see much from Tobey Maguire here - it was a little one-dimensional and even if he portrayed Fisher accurately as a paranoid introvert, he just didn't make it interesting.  I found it more interesting the large audiences they put together to watch the chess matches - how they dressed up and looked like it was the most extravagant even they had attended in years.  And the footage from ABC Wide World of Sports was fascinating to see how they played it up like a gladiator fight in the Roman colosseum.

Or, maybe there should be some sub-plots to make the movie more interesting, but there wasn't much here either.

I would have certainly made the storyline more complex and had some better acting (the guy playing the Spassky was quite good).",1468540800,,991,4.687861271676301

This film didn't focus enough on the game, strategy, etc. I know they probably figured that would bore most viewers, but I wanted to see more of the play. Most folks probably won't believe how dramatic and epic a film about chess can be. All of the actors are amazing. Tobey McGuire absolutely becomes Bobby Fischer in a way that only the best actors can. He not only speaks like Fischer and moves like him, he even sits like him! It reminded me of how Heath Ledger, standing on the corner as the Joker at the start of The Dark Knight, conveys the sense of determination for the heist he is about to pull, along with his weariness, simply by the way he stands; with his back to the camera, without a single word spoken.

I was an active chess player in NYC as a teenager at the time Fischer was starting to explode on the scene. To chess players in particular Bobby was a rock star and then of course he was discovered by the non chess playing public when he vied for the World Championship. I remember being at the Marshall Chess Club when he played via teletype to Cuba, each move being slowly transmitted so that an individual game lasted over 8 hours. That was something. Also, I worked the wall board for one of his games during a US Chess Championship at the Empire Hotel near Lincoln Center. That too was special. The chess player who was Bobby's second in the movie and in real life was William Lombardy, a very strong US Grandmaster. Some of those scenes didn't ring true to me, but who knows. But it was a great match. Spassky was a real gentleman, great player, and was willing to accomodate Fischer. He didn't want to win by default. It's too bad we never got to see a match against Karpov. But Fischer may have been already sliding into madness. What a shame. He really was the Mozart or Beethoven of chess. He saw things no one else saw.",1467244800,2,1234,4.488888888888889

7432921,3,B015DFI986,"For those who enjoy chess, this movie is worth seeing. Maguire presents an engaging perspective of Fischer and the demands of chess competition. The viewer is left somewhat frustrated and wanting more insights and understanding, including regarding Boris Spassky, but still it seems a decent limited biographical take on Fischer.",1467072000,,329,5.6
7432922,3,B015DFI986,"The Bobby Fischer/ Boris Spassky chess clash of 1972 was big news at the time. It was advertised as a clash of ideologies - democracy versus communism, freedom versus totalitarianism, plurality versus conformity. When Fischer emerged triumphant, it was seen as a vindication of American values, and the then President Richard Nixon made considerable cultural capital out of it.

Edward Zwick's biopic of Fischer (Tobey Maguire) takes the match as its central focus of attention, but concentrates more on the intensity of the protagonist, who from an early age proved himself a genius at chess but found it difficult to adjust to the rhythms of daily life. He rejected his mother (Robin Weigert) at an early age, and separated himself from his sister (Lily Rabe). As he establishes his reputation on the world chess stage, he acquired two full-time companions - former chess player Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) and fixer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg). Fischer's behavior is often abominable, as he reveals a John McEnroe-esque tendency to criticize everything, from the excessive noise in the chess arena to the lack of money on the table.

As he grows older, so Fischer becomes more and more obsessed with winning the world championship - so much so that he shows clear signs of paranoia. He imagines himself pursued by the Soviets at every tick and turn, and blames the Jews for having created such an untrustworthy universe (even though Fischer is himself Jewish). In several sequences he is shown destroying hotel telephones as he searches for the (non-existent) bugging devices. In the end we understand the significance of the title; it is Fischer himself who is the ""pawn sacrifice,"" as his monomaniacal devotion to chess costs him his sanity. Director Zwick encourages us to ask whether all the effort was really worth it.

Cinematographer Bradford Young's camera seldom allows Fischer any breathing-space, we watch Fischer's expressions, that range from total impassivity in the chess arena to maniacal obsession as he runs down flights of stairs, trying to escape from everyone. Maguire gives a convincing performance in what is admittedly a highly difficult role.

Having said that, the film does contain several slow passages that could have been effectively excised. Too much attention is spent focusing on silent sequences in the chess arena as Fischer faces up to Spassky (Liev Schreiber). There are also some historical inaccuracies: the BBC did not carry the NINE O'CLOCK NEWS in the mid- to late Sixties (it was only given that title a decade later); thus the logo that appears on screen - showing the BBC reports of Fischer's chess exploits - seems anachronistic.

Nonetheless PAWN SACRIFICE is generally worth watching, if only as a demonstration of how a so-called sport can often take over an individual's life.",1467072000,,2839,5.1496746203904555

7432952,3,B015DFI986,"First thing about this movie that told me it wasn't going to be trustworthy was the dreaded words, ""Based on a True Story"", which means that the filmmakers have done whatever they want with the history in order to serve their ""vision"" of ""the dramatic truth"". For us, the audience, we are left to wonder about the prostitute, the scene of confrontation at the beach, the anti-jew rants in his youth, and so on, ad nauseum.
Bobby Fischer is such a significant American figure that such dramatic machinations make the story worse, not better. Too bad the story could not have done a better job of exploring the reality between Bobby and his wildly unstable mother because a person does not usually turn out like Bobby did without emotional damage from childhood, whatever the source.
Also disappointing was the lack of looking directly at any chess games or positions, for instance, in the movie, Bobby told his second that he couldn't play a certain strategy unless he had an answer for a certain opponent's move.  But we, the audience have no idea what he is talking about, thus leaving us confused. Couldn't they have simply shown a diagram or graphic?
On the topic of the 'prostitute', the movie inserted this subplot while completely disregarding his real involvement with a couple of women around the world.
Also disappointing was this: Game 6 was acknowledged as a masterpiece, and it is known as part of history that Spassky did applaud Bobby at the end of that game. Yet we in the audience have no idea of what the game was. Now, there was no need to explain the game in any detail in the movie, I suppose, buthow nice it would have been to have a 'special feature' on the dvd of that game with a GM such as Larry Evans or Kasparov to explain the game move by move. This was a missed opportunity to advocate the fantastic game of chess to an audience.
The way the film was done at the close in completing the story of Bobby's life by using narrative and documentary footage was well done.
Much of the movie was really engaging and I enjoyed seeing it and will see it again, and I thank the filmmakers for making a modern day film about this subject. It simply saddens me a little that there is so much doubt about some of the specifics of the content.",1466553600,,2258,4.52078239608802

7433096,4,B015DFI986,"Okay, ""love"" is too strong, but I definitely liked it.  Even my wife, who is by no means a chess player, liked it.  It is reasonably accurate historically, with an embellishment or two.  The only drastic inaccuracy is that the world championship match did not generate anywhere near the public interest that was portrayed in the film.  I liked that they used actual games from the match in the movie, although not always portrayed with complete accuracy.  I also like that they didn't make Boris Spassky a ""bad guy.""  Spassky is one of chess's true gentlemen.  A minor annoyance is the use of pseudonyms for many of the people in the film.  Some are still alive and may not want their names used.  But at the 1966 tournament in Santa Monica, the other Russian present, in addition to Spassky, was Petrosian, who has been dead for decades.  Since he was not portrayed negatively, why not use his real name?  He is a historical figure after all.  But that's a minor quibble.  This is a good film.  I recommend it.",1465603200,,1011,4.575418994413408

7433285,2,B015DFI986,"This is an exceedingly unpleasant movie, essentially equating genius with insanity. Bobby Fischer was undoubtedly a great chess player, and unquestionably insane. Actually, I knew that before I watched this movie, as I have played through many of his games, and read a lot about him. I had hoped to learn something more about his chess creativity, but this very long movie about chess did not actually show a single chess combination. But let me be specific:

1. The worst part of the movie was its sound track. One moment, people are whispering so low you have to turn up the volume to hear what they're saying. The next moment your speakers are shaking with loud, raucous music, and you have to quickly turn down the volume to protect your hearing. And back again.

2. As noted, not a single chess combination is shown or explained. We are simply told that this or that game was a great game, but what made it great is left unsaid.

3. There is not a moment of wit or humor in the entire film. It is simply the portrayal of a man who, offered fortunes to play a game, was unable to enjoy his good fortune but spent his time taking apart telephones for fear they were being bugged, and seeing sinister communists and Jews around every corner. This may well be an accurate portrayal of Bobby Fischer, but why would anyone not involved in aberrational psychology want to spend an evening with him?

Exceedingly unpleasant, leaving a bad taste in the mouth, and a sense of a horribly wasted evening.",1464998400,,1497,4.574626865671642

Toby Maguire was particularly convincing as Bobby Fischer in the throes of paranoia.  By the nature of the game, parts of the film were slow-paced, but the mental energy being expended was palpable and made me feel I was witnessing a great athletic competition, and apparently Fischer approached chess exactly in that spirit.",1464998400,,435,4.773333333333333

His complex childhood environment and chess games with Boris Spassky were interesting, but I fast forwarded through many of the depressing parts of the film that dragged on  As a teenager, I thought that Bobby Fischer was a spoiled prima donna. However, this film has convinced me that he was used by chess organizations and the US government for monetary gain and publicity without regard for his deteriorating mental health. Unfortunately, the film was only sporadically entertaining. I much preferred the film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" which was a fascinating story about parents coping with raising a gifted chess player (not Bobby Fischer) to be a well adjusted human being, as well as a master chess player.",1464652800,,785,5.1328125

You want to display and create a real-to-life image of the man and the events, but you're tied to the limits of film-making and can't get as inspirational and creative as you otherwise might.

Bobby Fisher was an EXTREMELY talented and interesting, (and even charming,) young man that Toby Maguire missed utterly. (He was co-producer on this movie, so this choice was his.) All you have is a wild intellect that is having spiritual issues, and blames his Mom for most of it. (There was more to it than that.)",1534896000,,599,4.815533980582524

Liev Schreiber was also brilliant as Spasky, maintaining the quiet, calm normalcy of a chess master who realizes that he can't win against his opponent.

For folks who really know chess or really have read a lot about Fischer, they may be a bit put off. But most television and film don't really portray/convey chess well.
The ending felt rushed.
Not a terrible film; you won't be sad. Nor will you be inspired.
It's not a Friday/Saturday night film unless you have a group of chess wonks over.
Watch it because of the chess hype, because Fischer was enigmatic, and because you have World Chess Championship fever (or passing interest).",1533254400,,630,4.584070796460177

Never knew the backstory behind Fischer's odd requests during the championship.  It seems that he was suffering from mental illness during and before this time, and not only afterwards, when it became painfully obvious to all.  Yet, is there a connection between his paranoia and the brilliant chess he produced, which confounded even grandmasters?  An even better question is, is it possible for human beings to reach these Everest heights of creative potential without becoming tormented, twisted souls?",1523491200,,630,5.26
