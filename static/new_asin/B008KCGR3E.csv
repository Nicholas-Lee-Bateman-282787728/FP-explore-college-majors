8528632,1,B008KCGR3E,It wouldn't play on my dvd recorder so I was disappointed.  I would of loved to see it.  They should list that it doesn't play in the US.,1396224000,,137,3.857142857142857
8528633,1,B008KCGR3E,I had enjoyed the first series.  The second series was in  a format that could not be used in the U.S.. It should have been  properly marked so that I would have not bought it.  I returned the video.,1396051200,2,199,4.0256410256410255
8528634,5,B008KCGR3E,"You already know how taken I am with the Miss Fishers series. I was wondering if her clothes might become marketed? I could certainly sell them. You would be bringing a most elegant, romantic, feminine, and decent apparel,  so much needed in a world of sick and twisted designs that are marketed now for women. I am making a similar ensemble from the first series. The clothes for Miss Fisher are very elegant and feminine, yet, very class A.  cookielady903@mail.com",1393200000,3,466,4.8125

8528636,4,B008KCGR3E,"Catch this whodunnit set in 1920's Australia, for great costumes and a sassy heroine having great fun sleuthing out villains! You'll have just as much fun watching. It was the highlight of the viewing week when shown here in Australia; I doubt I missed an episode. I enjoyed this much more than Miss Marple, Murder She Wrote, etc., maybe because the series doesn't take itself too seriously. Acting is good, hits the right note, played a little 'tongue in cheek' sometimes. Features prominent British actor Miriam Margolyes (was in Harry Potter movies among others) in a supporting role in some episodes. The series episodes have subplots that build on the previous ones, so suggest starting at the beginning with Season 1. Should make a good Mother's Day present; my Mum was Miss Fisher's biggest fan! Enjoy!",1391644800,,809,4.955882352941177
8528637,1,B008KCGR3E,"Hi I ordered this vidio because I love the Miss Fisher mysteries, but this disc cannot be played on my dvd.

I would not recomend this to anyone,and need to cancel the second season if it has the same problem.
