2600171,1,B000G5SIEY,"This product's CD case has the previous season's titles listed instead of the titles of the episodes on the disk. As a result, I have not viewed the contents and have not gotten satisfaction from Amazon on a replacement. I believe that all of the CD covers are screwed up, so I would suggest that no one purchase this product until there is an announcement that this problem has been corrected. I am extremely disappointed since I pre-ordered this item and several months later I haven't been able to enjoy the contents.

Very, very disappointed in the total lack of customer service on this item :(",1163116800,3,599,4.650943396226415
2600172,1,B000G5SIEY,"The problem with this particular season I received is that the DVD's are right, they're for the 5th season, but the jackets for the DVD's are for the 4th season (in a lovely shade of green this time instead of magenta, like last time).  Have followed their directions to report a problem with the order, but, of course, if you do as they say, you get to:

click the ""Problem with this order?"" button, then select the ""Contact Seller"" button to e-mail the seller. ....and it's not there.

Why would they package the 5th season with the 4th season information on the jackets?  There's nothing on the DVD's to tell you what episodes one is watching.",1161302400,,646,4.543103448275862
2600173,4,B000G5SIEY,"I was so thankful that this season finally came out on DVD.  The first twelve episodes of the season were some of the best the series ever had to offer.  I bought the season five DVDs strictly for those first twelve episodes that show how Rita and Chris finally surrendered to their passion and love for each other.  The trials and uncertainty they went through about how to make their romantic relationship work with professional one always kept me glued to the screen.  The only reason this series of DVDs gets a 4/5 is because I don't have a vested interest in the second half of the season.  The two cops who replaced Chris and Rita mid-season were okay, but they just couldn't capture the same kind of magic that Chris and Rita had.  They just didn't have the vibe that kept you tuning back in for more.  But the season is well-worth the money for the first twelve episodes alone...at least, for any Chris and Rita lovers.  Also, another negative of the DVD set is they have the wrong episodes listed on the cover.  The episodes ARE season five episodes.  Don't panic.  However, the episode guide included with the set is the season four episode guide.  Hopefully, that is a glitch that the company will correct once they are informed of the error.  I went on-line and downloaded an episode guide for the fifth season to include with the DVDs.  The first twelve episodes are Chris and Rita dealing with their burgeoning realtionship and Chris' eventual death protecting Rita and their unborn child.  The rest of the episodes include the new duo.  All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.",1157673600,22,1591,4.608540925266904
2600174,3,B000G5SIEY,"I have been waiting all summer to get season five of Silk Stalkings and it finally arrived today, from Amazon.

I began reading the episode summaries on the dvd cases and realized that they sounded familiar to me.....well, the reason being, the summaries on the back are for season four not season five (they are exactly the same as the one's on my season four dvd cases)so, whoever designed the packaging really SCREWED UP BIG TIME!!!!!

However, it doesn't take away from the final season with Rita and Chris and how sad it is to see them leave the show.

Hopefully Anchor Bay will fix this mistake on the sets, I sent them an email this morning.",1157500800,18,648,4.521367521367521

2600184,5,B000G5SIEY,Great series.  Hope it makes a reappearance soon. Rob Estes and Mitze Kapture had just the perfect chemistry to make this a successful series.,1416441600,,142,4.916666666666667
2600185,5,B000G5SIEY,"I loved all seasons of this show but Season 5 is the end of the Chris and Rita era.  They were outstanding partners, friends and subsequently - man and wife.  Their chemistry throughout is amazing.  I honestly wish they would do some type of reunion show bringing them back together (Chris' death being a dream), even if it is only a 2-hour movie.  I bet it would be one of the most watched movies of the year.  Thanks Stephen Cannell for this drama.  I am sure I am not alone in saying it was one of the best which is why I purchased Season 5.  I may purchase seasons 1-4 as well.  After 5, I was no longer interested.",1404345600,2,619,4.142857142857143

2600188,5,B000G5SIEY,"This has been one of my favorite shows since it originally aired.  The first half of this season is better than the second half, but i suggest u watch the whole show from the beginning. The chemistry between Mitzi Kapture & Rob Estes is the best of any 2 cops on any police show ever!",1385769600,,284,4.163636363636364

2600190,5,B000G5SIEY,"I loved Silk Stalkings when I used to watch it on late night TV, and it is still fun and sweet.  These two characters work well together and care about each other.  The writers did a great job, too, I think, because I remember that I still liked to watch the show after Chris and Rita were gone, although I did love them best.",1360713600,,326,4.078125
2600191,5,B000G5SIEY,I am completely happy with purchasing the Silk Stalkings t.v. series season one through six. I am looking forward to more of the t.v. series to come out on dvd. This has been one of my favorite thriller/crime investigation shows from all the ones I have watched. It is a classic. Hopefully Silk Stalkings will release more dvds on Amazon.,1345507200,,338,4.65
2600192,5,B000G5SIEY,It was a great show. But I did get lost on season 5 When Rita was having Chris  child and told the captain she will keep in touch when the baby  was born. did i  not see it or what or did they not put it in and we have to guess at it. If any one can tell me what happen to Rita and the child leave a note on here thanks alot people.,1314057600,,332,3.4
2600193,3,B000G5SIEY,"When this show was on the air i thought it was great. I hated when they killed off Chris and then Rita left. I stopped watching the show after that, and soon after it was cancelled. I was recently watching some episodes and now i wander why i even watched this show. It is so corny and lame. The acting is alright, could be better. The clothing is blinding to look at. It just reminds me of other shows that now just don't stand the test of time, for example Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 90210.

There is no way i would ever get any of these series on DVD. I would consider the earlier seasons of Beverly Hills 90210, because i can still watch them and not think, ""oh come on, that is so stupid"". That's what i think when i watch Melrose Place reruns or Silk Stalkings. It's just not as great as you remembered.",1258070400,,814,4.1847133757961785
2600194,5,B000G5SIEY,"Here is an excellent series to enjoy if you love beautiful people, crime fighting mystery's and lots of action. Rob and Mitzi are a GREAT couple and when this series ran on the USA channel for 8 years 91 thru 99 I couldn't wait the the next weeks episode and even the reruns. I enjoyed the series for at least the first 5 seasons when they were on together [Rob Estes left after the 5th season].
If you love watching beautiful people [even the background characters] beautiful sunny Fl background Palm Beach, action, mysery and excitment then you will love having this series in your collection.",1214956800,,595,4.622641509433962
2600195,4,B000G5SIEY,"This is one of the best seasons, in my opinion, it is the season where Chris and Rita finally give into their feelings for each other only to see that dream shattered shortly after.
I really love this show and love watching Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture in their roles as Chris and Rita. They had so much chemistry together. I have to admit it is hard to watch the last episodes they appear in especially knowing what happens to Chris.
The first 12 episodes are the best. After that the new team of detectives come in and they don't have anywhere near the chemistry that Rob and Mitzi shared. The episodes are good, even though I don't really care for Holly and Michael. If it was all Chris and Rita episodes this would definitely get 5 stars. Overall the episodes are all very good and no problems with the DVDS.",1204156800,4,811,4.377483443708609

2600204,4,B000G5SIEY,"I followed this show from when it first came on TV in the early 90's. I have always thought this was one of the best police dramas to grace television. Even with some cheesy scripts, it had such a light and wonderful feel to a very serious subject (crimes of passion). The chemisty, compassion, and friendship (which eventually turned to love) between Chris and Rita was incomparable. Those actors did a fantastic job. Their chemistry may be the best I've seen on TV between a male and female lead in a drama since the British detectives in the 1960's the Avengers. Each season got better and better from season 1 to the present. That being said, it was so sad to see Chris die so soon after they got married after all the previouse 4 seasons of teasing in their professional relationship. I know the actors decided to leave the show. But I would have loved to see how now lieutenant Rita Lance and Chris would have made it as a married couple fighting crime on the police force. Maybe it's me, but I didn't see the aftermath on dvd after Chris died, and Rita deciding to leave the force to have her baby and get on with her life as I saw it on TV. At the time, I thought it would have been a good idea to devote at least one subsequent episode to update what happened to Rita since Chris demise. Of course the replacement actors were a step down. I thought the actress that replaced Mitzi Kapture as Rita's replacement had some talent, but the actor that replaced Chris, seemed stiff on the screen, and providing little chemistry to the pair. The storylines however are still good. Sad ending to one of the best TV crime dramas of all time. All 5 DVD's are without question worth the money. I rate the 1st 4 season's 5 stars, and the 5th a 4 because of the dropoff between the original Chris and Rita and their replacements.",1167696000,8,1825,4.386430678466077
2600205,4,B000G5SIEY,I was so glad to see Season 5 of Silk Stalkings finally being released.  I had not seen the ending of Rita and Chris until now and loved the last few shows they did together.  The first twelve episodes are Chris and Rita which was great.  The new people that took their place were ok but not the same.  There were a few good shows with them but not as good as the originals.  If you want to get the full ending of Chris and Rita then you should buy this one.,1165708800,8,458,3.9347826086956523
8128918,4,B000G5SIEY,"Just binge watched the entire series up to when they killed Lorenzo :( I know both Kapture and Estes wanted to move on but I didn't like how the writers went about the whole thing. It seemed rushed and so many other notable fave characters were missing from the funeral. All these characters were also key in the relationship with Chris and Rita. In my humble opinion, Chris should have had a better send off! I tried watching the rest of the series but it is sooo not the same! Even when it originally aired, I didn't finish the series. Chris and Rita were a great team and a dynamic duo!",1514592000,,589,4.315315315315315

8128920,5,B000G5SIEY,"The first two DVD sets (Season 1 & Season 2) have interviews from several cast members as well as from Stephen J. Cannell himself. He said of the show it was his longest running show (i.e., 8 seasons).

The show is about two cops who have a certain chemistry & are best friends who deeply care about each other. They are both detectives and are assigned cases that are referred to as silk stockings (sexual based crimes of passion) and the show takes place in Palm Beach Florida although most of it was filmed in San Diego and some of it in Scottsdale, AZ. Rita (Mitzi Kapture) narrates the stories that she and Chris (Rob Estes) star in during the first 5 seasons. That narration helps out a lot, but you won't find it after Mitzi left the show.

Captain Harry Lipshitz (Charlie Brill) is back and it seems like the writing and shows are much better than they had ever been. In the span of 4 of the first 12 episodes we find that Chris & Rita finally get together and decide they want a life together but office politics says they can't be partners and so new partners are introduced to both. At first I thought the new partners were good enough to have their own show (a possible spinoff) but when (spoiler alert) Chris is shot and Rita leaves the show we find the two new partners teaming up. About the only constant at this point is Captain Harry Lipshitz who turns out to be the glue that holds the show together outside of the opening credits sequence and music.

Others may not have liked the two new stars but they had a certain chemistry as well. It's unfortunate that we never learned what happened to them as they did not return for Season 6.

Despite Chris & Rita's departure, I still liked the show. I am glad that I bought the series. Mine had 3 discs (double sided) in two cases and an outer box. The music in the title sequence has also changed and become more jazzy, but returns in Season 6",1490659200,,1907,4.333333333333333
