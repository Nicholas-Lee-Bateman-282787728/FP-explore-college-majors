8410223,5,B003ZE5WKQ,"I purchased this set and watched it all.  The entire 2nd season is here.  I believe this is the Canadian release, with alternate French and English intro and outros.  The picture quality is fair, although does not have the sharpest mastering.  Generally, it's a bit soft, and the MPEG compression has slight smearing artifacts.  But it's definitely not the worst quality I've seen for TV show DVDs, and no VHS-type artifacts like dot crawl, so my guess is it's at least some type of decent analog master.  For fans: yes, this should be better than your VHS recordings.

It's been a long wait for the fans.  Long.  What can you say about the cast: Matt Frewer, Nancy Anne Sakovich, Barclay Hope, Colin Fox, and adding to the impressive assemble, Peter MacNeill, Soo Garay, Peter Blais, Nigel Bennett, and Michael Moriarty.  The character driven plot lines start in this season.  You start to see the internal lives of these characters more.  And, the cast delivers.

The production will be attractive to fans of the previous generation of film making: steady camera work, rich motive-based musical score, some real props and sets rather than all CGI (although there is still CGI).  The stories themselves are quite radical, sometimes more fantasy than anything explainable by current science.  It's out there.  There are always references to actual science, but I believe the stories here are more about entertainment than hard focus on science.  The tone of the dialogue is generally serious.  Frewer adds some comic touches here and there, but generally this show has a serious atmosphere.  This season also starts the long arcs in the story that will span multiple seasons and create some facinating background plots while the episodic storylines take place.  So, entertaining stories, impressive cast that is both attractive and has great chemistry, interesting characters, steady film work and rich score.  That's it.",1284854400,4,1921,5.073482428115016
