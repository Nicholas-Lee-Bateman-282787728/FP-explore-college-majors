8614354,3,B00FCAKC60,"I love the info in the book. The DVD is just a series of interviews with a great deal of influential and important drummers but, it falls short on the fact that they could have broken up the interviews with performances or examples from these great drummers. It would have made the DVD more compelling to watch.",1389139200,,311,4.473684210526316
