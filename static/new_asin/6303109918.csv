563786,5,6303109918,"This one is definitely more than a sum of its parts. Take a somewhat interesting story, some decent actors, some inconsistently good music, average direction, a total lack of cinematography, and slap it to together using the good ol' Disney formula. What do you get? A run-of-the-mill formulaic family film right? Right? Wrong.

For starters, there's Kevin Spacey as the heartless (or is he?) newspaperman out to create fame and promotion for himself by making Will a star. In general I can't stand this actor. But here, he gives the performance of a lifetime, and the mix of cynicism and idealism is perfect. He just OWNS this role. Then there's Mackenzie Astin as the title character. He's solid, and nails the innocent idealism of the character, which is what matters. David Ogden Stiers gives a nice nuanced performance as the sponsor of the race who comes to admire Will's determination. And George Gerdes practically steals the show in every scene he's in. Is is pure evil? Or is he mostly just trying to teach the hero a lesson? Does he come to admire Will? His performance is fleshed out (especially for a villain) that you'll probably have your own interpretation of his character that differs from mine.

The film isn't very pretty, and a lot of the scenery is kind of bland (no great cinematography to be found). Every time I watch this film I wish it had some better camera work, maybe a higher budget. And yet, every time I watch this film I feel drawn in emotionally. The story is just so powerful if you're an idealistic person I can't see how you could possibly not be moved.

Yes, this story ticks all the boxes. There's parental death, an impossible journey, training from hell, no one believes Will can do it. The farm and Will's future are at stake. He's not mature yet and still hasn't mastered handling the dogs (especially Gus). There's even a cute girl who likes Will who's onscreen for what seems like 5 seconds. And yet, as the story progresses, as Will goes through one trial after another...

Yes, I cried. Again.

I've seen this movie a few times, and I have yet to not cry at the end. I'm not talking misty eyes. I'm talking tears streaming down my face. This movie is downright cathartic. So yeah, it's a Disney family film. But after repeat viewings, I'm convinced it's better than White Fang, better than The Journey of Natty Gann, better than Homeward Bound. If you own ONE Disney journey film (someone on an epic quest to reunite with family members, save the farm, etc), THIS should be the one.",1497916800,,2530,4.651006711409396

563898,5,6303109918,"I just watched this movie tonight for maybe the 30th time.  Not only is it beautifully filmed, but the rigors of dogsledding are presented well - the sport is about endurance and more.  Almost like an archetypal fable - a native American mentor who makes no bones about how harsh the world is, prepares a young man, deeply scarred by the recent death of his father, for a dangerous race to exceptional manhood.  One always goes alone to meet the really hard challenges of life. Iron Will is an honorable hero, and I get to share in his confidence, courage and fortitude as I watch this film.  I definitely recommend it.",1496880000,,619,4.54954954954955

564519,5,6303109918,"This movie is about a dogsled race from Winnipeg to St Paul, Minnesota.  Is this based on true events?  It sounds like it.

Will Stoneman loses his father and he enters a race for ten thousand dollars to save the farm.  Typical Disney stuff right?  The hero will win for sure, right? Wrong.  This movie is great at suspense and Will winning the race is not certain

Will is soon known as ""Iron Will"" by the newspaper man that helped him get into the race played superbly,by Kevin Spacey.  There's the old Disney standby, David Ogden Steirs who plays the sponsor of the race.  Of course, there's villains that try to stop Will from being in the race.

This is definitely one of Disney's better efforts",1471910400,,700,4.484126984126984

564636,5,6303109918,"Based on the true story of Will Stoneman. I remember this movie from the 90s like it was yesterday. I think this is one of the best timeless family movies ever made. Will's dream is to be able to go to college. He gets an unexpected college acceptance letter in the mail. The only drawback: he can't afford it. He tells his dad about how much the letter means to him. His dad is very proud and is determined to enter and win an extremely dangerouss and challenging competition as an opportunity that would cover the cost. A dogsled race with a prize of $10,000 awarded to the winner. When Wills dad suddenly dies as a result of a sledding accident Will becomes completely devastated. Determined to reach his goal of going to college and to save his family's farm Will bravely decides to enter the race in his dad's place. The Disney ending is obvious. Will goes on to win the dangerous race and makes his dad proud. He saves the family farm and achieves his dream of attending college. Iron Will is an amazing true story of a young mans determination against all odds, the courage to never give up on ones dream and to go on to live that dream regardless of the obstacles. An excellent example that proves that anyone can live their dream if they try hard enough. The race is on! Never give up on your dreams. 5 stars.",1456963200,,1318,4.383673469387755

565131,5,6303109918,"Will Stoneman  is  a  mail  delivery  boy.  Either  that  or his  job  is  to  sort  out  the  mail.  &  just  loves  dog racing.  I  liked  his  father.  They  got  along  good  as  father  &  son.  For  now  Wills  mind  is  only  about  going  to  college,  up  until  his  dad  dies  after  getting  caught  in  the  freezing  water  &  the  ice  broke,  &  he  cuts  the  rope  so  his  son  doesn't  get  pulled  in.  He  had  lost  his  balance  as  he  was  making  his  turn  on  a  curve.  Choosing  to  face  the  facts  Wills  mother  wants  to  sell  the  farm  &  Gus.  I  wonder  a  lot  of  times  if  that  was  true.  Was  his  father  going  to  enter  the  race  to  help  his  son  out?  So  Will  finds  the  advertising  poster  &  tells  his  mother  &  the  Indian  guy  He  wants  to  enter  the  race  to  save  the  farm  &  for  him  to  go  to  college.  &  insists  to  his  mother  not  to  give  up  so  easily,  We'll  lose  the  farm  fighting!!  First  he  must  reassure  his  mother  that  he'll  be  alright  &  train  at  night,  learn  Stamina,  Confidence,  &  sharpen  his  reflexes  to  help  him  focus.  &  be  quicker,  The  Indian  has  got  all  the  perfect  tips.  He  must  get  ready  within  a  month.  &  must  learn  to  trust  the  dogs.  Gus  was  skeptic  at  first  because  he  only  knew  how  to  listen  &  mind  Wills  father.  Will  had  to  win  Gus's  trust.
Showing  up  at  the  headquarters  everybody  thinks  he's  too  young  &  can't  handle  the  tougher  weather,  until  Kingsley  (Kevin Spacey)  the  newspaper  reporter  steps  in.
&  whether  or  not  Will  won  everybody  will  notice  his  courage  &  him  wanting  to  win  for  the  right  reasons.  I  thought  he  had  the  right  idea  not  carrying  much  weight  choosing  to  survive  only  by  his  mothers  fruitcake  &  goes  on  into  the  night  while  the  others  are  sleeping.  Wills  also  got  an  excellent  whistle  for  the  dogs.  But  his  worst  enemy  is  an  evil  man  out  there  who  wants  to  stop  Will  &  some  of  the  other  racers  in  order  to  win!  Borg  from  Sweden.
&  eventually  sick's  one  of  his  dogs  onto  Wills  team  &  injures  Gus.  &  even  though  Gus  is  sidelined  Will  never  gives  up.  He  nourishes  Gus  back  to  100%  &  does  go  after  Borg  for  what  he  did.  Angus Mac Teague  had  put  Borg  up  to  that  getting  him  to  agree  on  a  gambling  proposition.  The  one  who  later  on  tries  offering  Will  5000'00  if  he  won,  &  telling  him  everybody  admires  you  &  respects  you.  Just  because  he  put  up  a  brave  fight  against  Borg. But  the  man  wasn't  nothing  more  than  a  sneak!  To  me  Angus Mac Teague  was  dirty  &  only  cared  about  the  profits  that  were  involved.  Whether  or  not  Mac Teague  was  just  setting  Borg  up  (Catch him, Stop  him  &  you  may  find  yourself  a  handsome  sum)  or  if  he  was taking  sides  with  Borg,  is  confusing.  Its  hard  to  figure  out.  Will  had  every  right  to  be upset,  &  I  also  agree  that  Kingsley  needed  to  give  him  some  privacy  until  Will  was  completely  over  his  mood!  If  Will  had  told  them  what  Borg  did  which  I  don't  know  why  he  didn't,  then  I'm  sure  Borg  would  have  been  disqualified!  Or  no  longer  allowed  to  participate  in  the  race.
I don't  know  why  him  &  Borg  worked  together  later  on. Why  didn't  the  others  go  that  way?  Will  asked,  You  follow  me  &  find  out!  But  its  the  only  way  to  get  ahead  of  the  other  racers  &  finish  to  win  the  race!  Me?  I'd  have  defied  the  mans  company  &  his  opinion!  His  mother  &  the  Indian  do  show  up  at  the  end  thanks  to  Kingsley.  A  lot  of  things  threatened  to  stop  Will,  &  he  would  not  have  won  the  10'000  dollars  too  easily.  Its  interesting  watching  him  beat  those  kind  odds!  Most  importantly  Will  had  the  heart  of  champion.  Everyone  was  calling  him  Americas  hero!
About  Gus,  I  think  he's  a  wonderful  dog!  I  loved  Gus!  I  can  understand  him  not  being  a  good  listener  at  the  beginning  of  the  show,  Their  friendship  just  took  a  little  time.  I  could  say  a  billion  things  about  Gus!  I  kind  of  wish  I  had  dog  like  Gus.
This  movie  I  believe  not  only  left  the  people  in  it  cheering,  Us  as  well!
I  plan  to  hang  onto  this  one  for  as  long  as  I  can!!
I  think  its  a  terrific  movie!",1439510400,,4550,4.068965517241379

566068,5,6303109918,"Every so often, an actor can just lose himself in a role and you don't realize who is playing the character on the screen...you just see that character.  Here, praise for such an accomplishment must fall on the shoulders of Kevin Spacey.  I didn't realize he was in this film until I checked the cast list online (Oh right...I'm gonna sit around for the credits).  But Mr. Spacey is one of many people worth praising for this unexpected good time.  Mackenzie Astin plays Will Stoneman, a boy who, after the accidental death of his father, becomes determined to save his family's farm as his old man had planned to by entering a sled dog race stretching from Winnipeg, Canada, to Saint Paul, Minnesota.  While it is a story about the determination of the underdog, a tale we've heard so often before, it is still endearing...maybe it's because I'm actually a fan of the sport or because this movie helped make me a fan...who knows.  While some of the opponents were over-to-the-top either in meanness, cruelty, or just plain doubt, the rigger of the competition could be felt.  While the ending was pretty predictable, it is nice to see the advice of Will's father's Native American friend, Ned Dodd, played by August Schellenberg, come full-circle.  Perhaps it is just the underdog story we need every so often and that would then be why it is such an unexpectedly worthwhile film.  Enjoy.",1403740800,,1389,4.754166666666666

I'd had a hard day and perhaps wasn't in the proper mood to sit through something like this where there is one calamity after another and another and all odds against this young man from the getgo.  Enjoyment ?  I didn't find not one peace/piece of enjoyment in this movie.  Just one downer after another with the exception of the crowd coming to cheer him on - excuse me, but ""wuptydo.""  Not to sound ""sexist"" goodness no.........but maybe this is a movie for men folk and not so much for women - perhaps that's what it is. I mean it is quite possible that it's a good movie, but because I'm from Venus and not from Mars (or is that vice versa) I just could not find this movie at all enjoyable in any sense of that word.

566862,2,6303109918,"""Iron Will"" is very well made.  The actors certainly try their best with a very fomulaic and even at times tired script.  Two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey is a high point of the movie but his character falls victim to too many cliches.  At the beginning of the movie Spacey's character doesn't give a damn about Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin) or what his motivations are.  He just wants to sell newspapers.  However in the end he comes to realize his initial thoughts were wrong and grows to support Will (Yawn).  Then you have the ""evil"" character who tries to intimidate Will with cornball dialogue.  Then (Surprise!) Mr. ""evil"" cheats often during the race and is horribly abusive to his sled dogs.  The final scenes of Will's hard fought victory were meant to be inspiring, but also felt like a tired plot device recycled yet again.  The one thing that I liked the most in the movie were the sled dogs.  Being a huge fan of the Siberian Husky (and an owner of one too) a smile was always on my face when I saw the magnificent dogs.  In the end, ""Iron Will"" is not a terrible movie.  It's at least watchable, but could have been a lot better.",1333929600,,1148,4.466346153846154

566864,4,6303109918,"Nearly as good as I remember. I found the music swelling a bit annoying, but a quick grab at my remote fixed that just fine. I'm a bit upset that Disney seems to have something against their main character having two parents tho.

In Finding Nemo, Disney kills Nemo's mom in the opening scene. In Bambi, they kill his mother. In The Lion King, Simba's dad gets killed off. Aladdin is an orphan, Jasmine has no mom. In the Fox and the Hound, Tod's mother is killed by hunters. Cinderella lives with her evil stepmother. Pocahontas has no mother, while Dumbo has no father. Toy Story's Andy also has no father. Penny from The Rescuers is an orphan. And poor Snow White is not only an orphan, but the wicked Queen tries to kill her, too.

I wonder how this movie would have been received if it was closer to the actual historical event, where the heroic American LOST, and the winner was an Indian (who was the target if discrimination). I also wonder why they had to be so obvious with the nick/name: Iron Will Stoneman, and who actually had the iron will, the boy or the dog.

Snarkiness aside, aside, I still think Iron Will is a good movie, and would have enjoyed it more if only the music didn't get really loud every few minutes. And if they had managed to save Will's dad instead of killing him.",1315267200,,1299,4.381742738589212

Overcoming a seemingly fore-gone conclusion, Will (the main character) continues the race casting greed and cheating asunder.  And kudos to Astin McKinsey (playing Will) for real acting in the bitter cold, snow, and dark of night!!  No special effects here; everything is the real mccoy!",1289952000,,497,5.098765432098766
566869,4,6303109918,"There's no denying that Disney have went horribly astray in recent years, churning out pure garbage that even the most deluded of families find appalling, and all in the name of political correctness. Walt built the studio and his reputation on taking risks and pushing boundaries through the right of free speech. But the Disney label now seems to be ashamed of its past and leans toward conservative values. They have all but erased their ""racist"" film Song of the South from existence and show little, if any, of the courage and nerve Walt thrived upon in the 30s and 40s. I'm not sure what has provoked this alarming shift in quality from a once flawless studio. Perhaps they think that every mother out there shelters every one of her children against any and all things that can possibly contaminate their fragile minds and only the trusted House of the Mouse knows what's best.

Set in 1917 the story follows Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin, looking like Sean Patrick Flannery) a boy who dreams of saving the family farm and going to college. But his only chance of doing so is by winning $10,000 in a cross country dog-sled race. With little training and overwhelming odds against him he throws himself head-first into the race despite the adversity.

It's a great movie for those who love adventure, escapism, choo-choo trains, period settings and Huskies. I'm not keen on dogs in the slightest but Huskies are lovely.

Kevin Spacey and Brian Cox (as old then as he is now as the man was born middle-aged) provide good support but the movie belongs to Astin, who somehow hasn't achieved the level of fame his brother has. His acting skills are certainly not in doubt and this movie proves he's a good lead.

Iron Will is a perfect example of how far Disney has fallen in the past decade. Made in 1994, it's a solid adventure film with strong characters, lovely scenery and an uplifting story. Flash-forward to January 2002 (a mere 8 years) to the pile of crap Disney movie Snow Dogs starring Cuba Gooding Jnr. A very similar movie in terms of story but a WORLD apart in tone. One is serious and respectable, the other features multiple clichs and fart jokes.

566933,4,6303109918,"The ""professional"" review calls this a ""B"" movie but that isn't really a good indication of how much you may enjoy watching it.

It is, after all, a Disney movie -- one that I could show my kids as an example of what someone with determination can accomplish in the face of adversity. (Think ""Rudy"" or ""The Greatest Game Every Played."")
Against all the odds, Will enters a long distance dog sled race (not the Iditarod) in order to save his family's home. As if the race itself isn't enough, he faces danger from a competitor who will do anything to win as well as other forces outside the race. His only support is a reporter with some mercenary as well as altruistic motives who sees a good story in the making. But everyone underestimates Will. They don't know what he's made of. Along the way, he gets a lot of help from his lead dog who is probably his best friend. Yes, it has some overly sentimental moments but overall, it's a totally enjoyable film that you can show to almost any age audience.
MacKenzie Astin is not quite as good an actor as his brother Sean, but he gets the job done creating an appealing character that you will definitely root for.",1264032000,,1243,4.432314410480349

He said the story was based on the fact that his father died and in just two weeks he fulfilled his dying fathers wish and won the race.
I have always associated Will Stoneman with an old man I once saw on TV.  He talked about winning a dog sled race and later going to the (North/South Pole?) on an expedition back in those days.  He was hired because he was an expert with dog teams.  Albert Campbell says he won the race in 1917.  The Canadian politician Albert Campbell was born in 1910 I believe, in Canada.  And grew up on the family farm.

So, who knows what the real story is?  If someone does I would certainly appreciate more information.

They loved it and were eager to learn about dog sled races; the Iditarod and others. It even integrated into our unit on Native peoples. As a finale, when the snow was fast disappearing we watched Iron Will. They were impressed with the determination and optimism that Will carried throughout the challenge.",1175299200,,582,6.185185185185185
567063,5,6303109918,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Not only is it a compelling and inspiring tale, the viewer develops a bond with the actors and the dogs (I love Gus to this day).  It's a great movie to watch with the family.",1174867200,,223,3.933333333333333
567064,5,6303109918,"It's a movie of great courage and determination.

I purchased the movie because it was filmed close to where I live and I wanted to see if I recognized any of the landscape.

The movie is beautifully done. You are able to forget about all the petty worries of life and really get into rooting for Will and his dogs.

A Very heart felt movie that I could watch over and over.",1173312000,,374,4.166666666666667

567067,4,6303109918,"I enjoyed this movie.  The story is timeless and teaches strong values.  Will starts out as a very trusting person.  He learns along the way some valuable ""life lessons"" - how to protect oneself without becoming hard and jaded or sacrificing one's values.",1162425600,,255,4.883720930232558
567128,4,6303109918,"Admittedly contrived and predictable with stereotypical characters, Disney's 1994 IRON WILL is nonetheless an enjoyable, sentimental and heartfelt film.  Sean's younger brother Mackenzie Astin stars as a deteremined youth who in 1917 plans on winning a 500 mile dogsled race from Winnipeg to St. Paul.  He is of course faced with nasty adversaries (BRIAN COX included)and a blizzard and his lead dog who is attacked by an opponent's vicious lead dog.  Kevin Spacey brings his usual fire to the role of an opportunistic journalist who initially uses Astin's exploits to gain readers, but eventually warms to the boy's heroic persistence.

Beautifully filmed in and around Duluth, IRON WILL should appeal to families looking for moralistic and uplifting adventure.",1158883200,,762,5.432203389830509
567129,5,6303109918,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. Oh sure, it's a little corny here and there, but the dogs and the scenery more than compensate for any shortcomings. A thoroughly enjoyable movie..",1158105600,,334,4.491803278688525
567130,4,6303109918,"How much of this story is true is up for dispute. I suspect most of it is highly exaggerated. Nonetheless, it is inspirational and fun to watch: an excellent adventure tale.

The movie reminded me of ""White Fang"" with the winter scenery and the young hero, played by MacKenzie Astin, looking and sounding much like Ethan Hawke. The story was simply about a dog-sled race in the early part of the 20th century.

The picture is beautifully shot, especially the train scenes, and looks very good on DVD. The villains in here aren't as despicable as in other films, so it's more pleasant to watch. I enjoyed the entire story except for the whistling at the finish line which was a bit stupid, but that's minor.

This is one of Disney's best live-action films.",1146441600,,755,4.619402985074627

567134,5,6303109918,"I RECENTLY WATCHED 'IRON WILL' IN MY GEOGRAPHY CLASS AND I THINK ITS THE BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE. IT IS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN CALLED WILL STONEMAN AND HE IS QUITE POOR. WHEN HIS FATHER DIES WHILE OUT RIDING WITH WILL, WILL FEARS RIDING NEAR WATER. WILL ENTERS A DOGRACE AND SETS OFF EARLY EACH MORNING TO GET IN THE LEAD. THROUGH THE MOVIE WILL GETS THROUGH TOUGH OBSTICLES LIKE A MEAN MAN AND THE DEVILS SLIDE. WILL GETS FROST BITE AND PEOPLE THINK HE'S CRAZY FOR GOING ON BUT HE REALLY WANTS TO SAVE HIS MOTHERS FARM AND WILL ENDS UP WINNING WITH GREAT STRUGGLE AS HE FALLS OFF HIS SLED RIGHT BEFORE THE FINISHING LINE. THIS IS MOVIE HAS A VERY TOUCHING STORYLINE.",1077840000,,669,4.234375
567135,4,6303109918,"I was expecting this to be a run of the mill Disney adventure movie, with the hero entering a race at the beginning, you know he's going to win, right? wrong. This is much harder than the typical family films we associate with Disney, without losing the quality. Young Mackenzie Astin (son of John) gives a great performance as a seemingly naive yet brave boy who enters a dog sled race to get the 10,000 he desperately needs to go to college. Nominal star Kevin Spacey wisely remains in the background and lets this young lad shine through. The story has a number of unexpected twists, that interest and delight throughout the movie. Who are Will's friends? Who can he trust? Will he stop to save a man's life if it means losing the race? The cinematography is masterful, both in the close-up work and  views of Minnesota countryside (doubling for Canada) The film is also refreshing because the incidental music is restrained, and even absent in some scenes. This would be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good adventure with a touch of realism.",1073779200,,1044,4.643243243243243
567136,5,6303109918,"""Once in a generation an athlete pits himself against such overwhelming odds, that even the most jaded spectator finds himself cheering breathlessly""...
Iron Will is a moving true-life story about the determination and valor of one heroic young American who sets out to win a 500-mile dogsled race across the U.S. and Canada.  Up against seemingly impossible odds, ""Iron Will"" Stoneman strives on to achieve his dream: to save his parents beloved farm and go to college; and somewhere along the way, the seventeen-year old boy becomes a man.
Although this movie is a bit formulaic and anyone can guess the Disney ending, that doesn't make it any less thrilling to watch; when I first saw this film in the theater, the whole room was cheering him on at the end!  Definately worth your time to check out this great family-friendly film!",1071532800,,834,4.866197183098592

If you like adventures in nature and or survival stories you might like this one.  It's about determination, stamina, will and endurance too.",1026604800,,284,4.73469387755102
567184,3,6303109918,"As one reviewer noted, this film is like the classic Disney adventure films of old. I was born in 1952, so I went to many of them as a kid. The acting isn't bad overall, and the adventure and scenery and photography are great.
* * * NOTE: Some Spoilers ahead * * *
I missed some of the begining, but from where I came in, I could tell that the story was predictable, and the ending, where he wins by a mere few inches and only a second or so, because the crowd takes up whistling his tune, which gets him and his dogs moving again, was ... too much to take, I think. Maybe okay for kids, but too melodramatic for adults.
Yet ... it's nice that movies like this are still being made, and it's nice that when the bad guy gets attacked by dogs, instead of being killed, the hero shoots his gun to scare off the dogs and save the evil Swede.
Plus, the hero holds off shooting his (thought-to-be-mortally-) wounded dog, Gus ... and ends up taking him to the finish -- or, rather, Gus takes him to the finish.
Sadly, or maybe understandably, Kevin Spacey didn't seem particularly believable or enthusiastic in his part.
But, despite the negative things that can be said about this film, it is, I think, a good family and children's film, with a minimum of violence, though enough to engender excitement and add realism. It teaches good values and lessons, and even though the characters are pretty formulaic and predictable such that you know pretty much where this picture is going to go and how it's going to end up, it's an enjoyable and pretty film -- and you can really feel the snow and cold!
If I had young children, I'd definitely buy it for my DVD collection.",1021161600,,1662,4.347266881028939
