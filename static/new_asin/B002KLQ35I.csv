3941872,4,B002KLQ35I,"Literary adaptations are a dangerous thing. Fortunately, the action takes place in 1918, then 1911.
A drama needs a strong photography, here provided by the great Eugene Schuftan, uncredited because he was not an union member
(Archie Stout not a cinematographer to forget is credited. Now we need a good transfer and VCI is usually to be trusted.
SIRK had escaped the indignity of such shooting titles as STRANGE CONFESSION and GOODBYE MY LOVE.
This is really his film, he wrote the dialogue, with twin credit under the pseudonym of MICHAEL O'HARA, but we are not in a classroom and must forget about the other films because that early (12/1943-1/1944) second US film stands on its own legs.
In 1918, Kharkov, an impoverished aristocrat, EDWARD EVERETT HORTON, tries to have a manuscript published by the newspaper now owned by
ANNA LEE,and confesses that the manuscript was written by GEORGE SANDERS seven years earlier.
Back to 1911 SANDERS, local magistrate, engaged to LEE, desires the ambitious LINDA DARNELL, equally loved by the rich HORTON. DARNELL is soon murdered, after some romantic interludes.
CHARLES HAAS ,overseer of HORTON's estate is sent to Siberia.
And the murderer is: I won't tell you. LEE reads it and takes measures.
It's a brilliantly written and directed drama. Not a flamboyant melodrama which would be inappropriate and would weaken he characters. It only lacks more money.
DARNELL and SANDERS are very good.
We are still waiting for the 3 great SIRK pictures: SHOCKPROOF (Columbia), THE FIRST LEGION (U-A) and THUNDER ON THE HILL (Universal).
SIRK has become a dead idol (better than a living idol, nobody expects the French Inquisition) and it blurs the pleasure of his films.
Everything is now sacred: you can't put down any of his films without getting insulted.
He was a true professional who wouldn't have approved of that cultural fanaticism.",1253750400,16,1877,5.058064516129032
8372065,5,B002KLQ35I,"George Sanders plays a Russian judge who can't resist the beauty of Olga (Linda Darnell). He throws away his fiancee (Anna Lee), his life, and his self-respect because of this peasant girl. Even at the end, love isn't enough as he tries to save himself at the cost of an innocent man.

The cast and direction are superlative. There are moments when you feel George Sanders could've gone a different way, but doesn't because he's too weak. Both Olga and Nadena remark that his animal drives are just too powerful.

It's also an excellent depiction of Russia pre-revolution and the aristocracy's rottenness as personified by Piggy (Edward Everett Horton).

One of Sirk's masterpieces.",1492905600,,682,5.017699115044247
8372066,5,B002KLQ35I,"the story was great and the  actors were just as fine
I recommend this too anyone  and I am glad to add this to my collection.",1384732800,,126,3.8076923076923075
8372067,3,B002KLQ35I,"is ok; got it because George Sanders is in it; one of my favorites!  At first, disc wouldn't play; had to coax it 3 times to play. Machine said no disc; and I took it out; put back in; still wouldn't play; did this three times; and my player is fine! I finally coaxed it to play so hope it plays the next time I try to watch it!",1367884800,2,328,3.753623188405797
8372068,4,B002KLQ35I,"Early Hollywood Sirk film presented Linda Darnell with her first real opportunity to show that she had far more talent than the fluffy girl roles she had been handed up to that point. Unfortunately except for rare occasions like Fallen Angel, Hangover Square and A Letter to Three Wives she didn't get many more chances to shine although she was always excellent with the material provided. Aside from her this has an excellent cast all giving fine performances and many hints of the Sirk touch that would bloom fully a few years on.",1353801600,4,533,4.741935483870968
8372069,4,B002KLQ35I,"A very peculiar film indeed. Chekov's only novel has been set in postrevolutionary Russia, which is surprising enough, but what for me was even more surprising was to see George Sanders in what I beleive must be his best part ever, or at least as good as the one he creates in Rosellini's Viaggio in Italia. The last fifteen minutes of this movie is filled with one great surprise after the other, and even though I wasn't that interested before, I was truly fascinated to see where Sirk and Sanders took me, and how moved I was, finally, by the whole experience of ""Summer Storm"".",1343606400,8,581,4.542857142857143
8372070,3,B002KLQ35I,"A not uninteresting adaptation of Chekhov's ""The Shooting Party,"" with the requisite 1940s Hollywoodization (have peasants ever looked so clean?). One of Douglas Sirk's earliest Hollywood efforts. Begins in 1919, two years after the Russian Revolution, but takes place, via flashback, in 1912, five years before the Revolution, so we get to see an example of a profligate Russian nobleman (a strangely cast Edward Everett Horton). Sanders is very good as the judge whose obsession with a beautiful peasant woman (Darnell) eventually ruins his life. Darnell is certainly sultry and seductive, but there's nothing peasant about her in her early scenes. (Just as a nit-picking point of information: Darnell's name could not have been Olga Kuzminichna; it would have to have been Olga Kuzminovna - just the way patronymics/middle names are formed in Russian.) Certainly worth a look, especially for those who enjoy films from the 1940s.",1343174400,,932,5.346938775510204
8372071,4,B002KLQ35I,"This looks like a low budget version of a classic Russian story. But it has the advantage of a fine cast, interesting story, and assured direction. George Sanders, as ever, is outstanding, and Linda Darnell in her vixen mode, is quite good.",1267315200,9,240,4.738095238095238
8372072,4,B002KLQ35I,"Linda Darnell is beautiful as usual in all her films and George Sanders great as usual.  I wish the movie had been in color but it wasn't.  Linda Darnell is a young peasant woman who aspires to more in life and entrances three men in the process.  The story line was from a Chekov play about pre-revolutionary Russia.

Although I liked the story and the actors, it appeared to have been produced on a low budget.  The backgrowund sets looked so artificial as if they had been drawn with a lead pencil, shaded. and then enlarged. It was a pitiful rendering of one dimensional backdrops of poorly drawn Russian Onion spired churhes, etc.  I just couldn't get past how phoney it looked except for Linda Darnell's costumes.

Overall, I would recommend seeing it, if only to see Linda Darnell and George Sanders.  The studio that made this low budget movie should be ashamed for not having spent a bit more money on its production which could have made for a much better movie.",1259971200,5,972,4.578034682080925
8372073,2,B002KLQ35I,"In pre-Revolutionary Russia, Linda Darnell is a voluptuous peasant girl determined to rise thanks to her natural endowments. She does attract foolish Count Edward Everett Horton and magistrate (he can investigate crimes) George Sanders, who is engaged to Anna Lee. But Linda's father marries her off to a thick peasant, who unfortunately loves her dearly. The outcome is a fatal stabbing, a trial, and the real perpetrator self-condemned only years later.

The film is an adaptation of a minor novel, The Shooting Party, written by Anton Chekhov when he was 24. The 1944 print has been pretty well refurbished. But from first minute to last, I was painfully, restlessly aware that every aspect is burdened by the cliches of Hollywood square moviemaking. I am a set, I am a costume, I am makeup, I am tired awkward words from a dumbed-down script, I am a Kodak camera, I am editing playing listlessly with its alphabet blocks.

Hey, don't all of Douglas Sirk's movies suffer from his conventional approach? Can I, having seen the lifelike, intelligent, emotionally and psychologically sophisticated film dramas of recent decades, any longer endure the drear and dreck of the bygone Hollywood studio system? It's a rhetorical question because I know you young whippersnappers don't give a dreck about what Ye Olde Reviewer can endure. Pass the popcorn.

FOOTNOTES

1  The supplement contains an audio-only interview with author/film buff Bernard Dick, who admires Sirk of course, and probably everything else from Tinseltown.
2  It also includes a trailer of Uncle Vanya, the 1957 Broadway production transferred to the screen with cast intact: Franchot Tone, Dolores Dorn, Gerald Hiken, George Voskovec. Apparently it's heavy handed on the humor. Is Kit-Parker-Films also going to give us this Chekhovian corpse as embalmed by the American undertaker?
3  The DVD case says the Summer Storm music score was an Oscar nominee in 1945. Bah! Hollywood dreck.
4  One of the stills to promote the film shows Miss Darnell supersultry, as if auditioning for The Outlaw. Well, let me give the girl a break. She certainly would have outperformed amateur Jane Russell on the screen, and would have outboobed her too after Howard Hughes personally fitted her with his Flying Fortress brassierre.",1256774400,2,2281,5.145945945945946
8372074,2,B002KLQ35I,"This is a genuinely bad movie.  The casting is atrocious (e.g. Edward Everett Horton as a Russian Count), and the directing is awful.  Oh, did I mention the script? It is the worst part of the film by far.  In fact, Summer Storm may become a cult film.  I felt especially sorry for Linda Darnell, hopelessly out of her depth in the role of a Russian peasant (flashy makeup and all).  How George Sanders must have been amused when receiving his check.

Why on earth would this film come out on DVD while so many classics are still unavailable?  In any case, stay clear of Summer Smoke.  The two stars are for the music and Sanders.  Otherwise, this 1944 movie would be included it many lists of the worst films ever made.",1256774400,7,720,4.393939393939394
