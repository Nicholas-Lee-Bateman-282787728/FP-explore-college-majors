2691861,4,B000KJTFHA,"Night of the Living Dorks is a must have if you are a movie buff with a zombie movies' collection.  The actors speak German, so you have the option of watching the film in dubbed languages, or subtitles.  I prefer to listen to the actual voices of the actors in German and read the english subtitles.
  What makes this movie different from the normal zombie layout, is the fact that the zombie crisis happens to teenagers who also have the stresses of school, parents, cliques, and sex to deal with.  When the teenagers are accidentally turned into zombies, they try to find a solution that will turn them back into normal mortals.  All the while, they are still trying to keep up with school, teachers, their peers, parties, drugs, and sex as if being a zombie is just another problem to add to their teenage angst.  But as they find that being zombies has a downside, they also find that it can also have it's upside.  They just might be able to cross off some of their issues before they decompose completely.
  If you buy this cd, I suggest watching the special features.  There are many more laughs to be had in the special features. As the cover of the movie says 'cult fiction', it is obvious while watching, that this is a classic.  I hope you enjoy it.",1209081600,2,1261,4.458515283842795

The voice over talent was a bit disconcerting but the voice actors really did a pretty good job of translating the humor. That said I was majorly disappointed with the fact that I had to watch it with the voice over at all.
This review  is for the unbox rental version. The preview of the movie showed the cast speaking the german in which it was filmed, with english subtitles. This is how I wanted to watch it. I love listening to german, I felt thoroughly ripped off and disgusted that instead of listening to beautiful german, I was stuck with a cheesy voice over track. Like i said the voice talent actually did a good job and it was a funny, sometimes even touching movie. But if you advertise it one way then show it that way! XP",1193356800,3,834,4.346153846153846
2691865,2,B000KJTFHA,"""Night of the Living Dorks"" is aimed at the teenage comedy/horror market. It's a little bit like a low-grade German version of ""Scream"" mixed with ""American Pie"" - plenty of low-brow sexual humor to go around. Despite its good natured humor, the movie doesn't quite achieve even the B-level movie status to which it aspires.

NOTE: Unfortunately, the version of the movie available here on Unbox suffers from really poor dubbing. The trailer showed closed-captioning, which I believe would have made the movie much more bearable.",1193356800,,529,5.151162790697675
2691866,3,B000KJTFHA,"I am on a lengthy mission to try to review every zombie movie.  My latest entry is this odd little creation from 2004, ""Die Nacht der Lebenden Loser"" ( a.k.a. ""Night of the Living Dorks"").  A German Teen Romanic Comedy Zombie flick.  Why not?

First, and most important, what strain of Zombie are these ""Loser"" Zombies?  These are the voodoo created, dorky, stoner high school variety.  Aside from when Konrad gets his glowing eyes and blood lust, these are mostly cognizant zombies.  They have super zombie strength and x-ray vision, but are slowly decomposing and becoming victims to their hunger for flesh.  This has the ""Teen Wolf"" vibe where being a dork makes them outcasts, but being confident monsters makes them popular.  This film has a very 80's vibe, in that respect.  Not much killing or fear from these zombies, but Zombie Konrad gives us some good gore.  Wurt Zombie does a good job as a stoner zombie, but he still can't top Seth Green and Elden Henson as stoner zombies in the unfairly maligned ""Idle Hands"".  Sill, I give this a decent overall zombie score of: 6/10

The gore is pretty good in this one.  Not a lot of it, but a decent enough amount for a movie that is trying to be a comedy.  The microwaved foot is a great gag, so for that I will give a gore score of 6/10.

Gratuitous sexism and nudity is in the mid-range. The goth girl is supplied with sexy goth lingerie for a ritual.  The ""hot"" girl (who is not very attractive) takes her top off in the teen-sex-comedy ""nerd is going to score in the bedroom"" kind of way.  The best is when Zombie Konrad suddenly gets x-ray vision, and can see through a girl's pants.  After that he decides it's dinner time.  A gratuitous sexism and nudity score of 6/10.

The movie was not very boring.  The film is entertaining and kept my interest.  I never found myself reaching for the FF button on the remote.  Though, the film is filled with so many 80's and 90's teen-movie clichs that I was torn between comfortable nostalgia, and being annoyed at their lack of creativity.  That being said, there was a great gag during and after the ""sex scene"" that led to some funny zombie twists on what I would have been some very ""American Pie"" moments.  All in all, it was an entertaining flick and so on the boredom scale (0 being boring, 10 being Dawn of the Dead) it gets a 7/10.  The dialogue gets a 5/10 for being a predictable teen comedy dialogue (you know the story: dork wants to date the ""hot"" girl who is dating the jock, while the cute outcast girl likes the dork, but the dork doesn't see her that way.  Dork has two friends: a nerd and a stoner).

Overall, I think this is an enjoyable film, and worth watching.  The end of the movie is very convenient and a little too easy; and as I mentioned above, the teen comedy clichs are endless (The kids clean the house after the party just in time for the parent to walk in the door.  Oh no!  The parents open the one door where they stuffed all the garbage!  Wah-wah!).  Of course, I am sure some of the experience is lost in translation while watching the movie with subtitles.  I tried the dubbed track (in true ""zombie movie"" fashion), but the acting was too terrible to stomach.

There is no ""zombies infecting and taking over"" scenario, but in the extras there is an alternate ending worth watching where that was the plot, and the last 10-15 minutes of the movie are entirely different from the fuzzy/happy ending of the final cut.  This movie is not going to stir up a zombie fanatic, but it is a movie a zombie fanatic could maybe watch with a date looking for a good chuckle.  Though the realization that student dynamics in high school is somewhat universal across countries is far more frightening than any of the intentional scares in this movie, ""Die Nacht der Lebenden Loser"" still gets a solid overall rating of 6/10 (which is a pretty good rating for a zombie movie).",1186704000,6,3901,4.4576271186440675
2691867,5,B000KJTFHA,"I'm surprised this movie took so long to be released on dvd in the U.S.  Anyway, this movie is basically ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""American Pie"" with zombies thrown in. And it is very funny if you like that kind of humor.",1186185600,,223,4.186046511627907

A fun, fairly well thought-out storyline, borrowing heavily from John Hughes and Sam Raimi, with likeable lead characters; ""Night of the Living Dorks"" is better drawn and acted than Hughes' ""Weird Science"" or many more-recent teenage horror flicks that attempt to copy Raimi's successful ""Evil Dead"" formula. The scares are played for laughs, and often quite successfully. The teen sex-farce elements are fairly innocuous and low-key, and fit logically into the story.

2691880,2,B000KJTFHA,"Like many drug comedies, the main purpose is to have dorky people get high and do dumb things. In them everyone does drugs even hospital workers openly (drug addiction does cause alot of PROBLEMS in hospitals though) , it's a not a bad habit it's part of the whole scene.  The purpose of this movie is less a teen movie than a drugout scene, drugs may be part of teen lives but this is about drugs first , then teens , then zombies. It would have been different if drugs weren't the central theme though , drug usage is part of lots of horror flicks and comedies. but the drug comedy has a certain aspect to it , the aspect that drugs are totally acceptable and used by almost everyone and not going to destroy most users lives eventually. This is even different than cheech and chong , where you could see that it was part of a scene and not acceptable out of the scene , like teachers doing it for instance. But such is this movie, a drug comedy in which dorks die because of dope , then don't even mind being dead , or brain dead? personally I know many drug users that are zombies really. shells remain of their lives , but these zombies are played so lightly that think being dead is sorta cool.  hmmmn.  oh well, it's a german movie by the way, with lots of deleted scenes. It has a good picture and the dvd looks sharp, but if you like drug comedies then this is for you maybe, if not avoid this one.

2691884,3,B000KJTFHA,"Three teenage losers become undead heroes after a voodoo spell goes horribly wrong. The guys head out to exact revenge on their high school tormentors using their new found powers, while trying to win over the girls of their dreams. DORKS is sure to become a sleeper hit overseas after seeing phenomenal success in its home country of Germany, inspiring an American remake that is due out in 2010. Its classic teen misfits are perfectly cast and played with excellent comedic timing by the three leads. While the cliched humor often sinks to outrageous lows, the script is cleverly written with a sharp wit and tons of bloody gags. The film also benefits from being entirely self-aware, poking fun at genre conventions while paying homage to staple Horror entries like DAY OF THE DEAD. Dinter strikes a strong balance between the laughs and shocks as well, never favoring one over the other and including plenty of both. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DORKS is one of the  most enjoyable Horror Comedies in years that will get you rooting for the underdogs!

I found it a refreshing alternative to the standard zombie gorefests.

As a zombie aficionado, I enjoyed the filmmakers' depiction of the slow progression of zombism in the main characters.  The makeup was in some ways whimsical, but it actually progressed more believably than many of the more hard-core mainstream zombie movies.

I agree with the other reviews in that the dub is horrendous, however it just made the film more unbelievably campy and enjoyable for me.  Seriously, if you're watching an English dub of a German romantic zombie comedy - are you really all that concerned with the quality of the voice-acting?  I loved it.

One more item of note: the ritual scene where the zombie curse is inflicted on our heroes is worth the price of this DVD all by itself.  Six teenagers in a cemetery in the middle of the night, conducting a zombie ritual with a frozen chicken, a band-aid and ""authentic"" zombie ashes purchased off the internet...

2691888,5,B000KJTFHA,"I kann deutsch screiben, aber fur Die Amerikaner Amazon, ich wurde im English Screiben. Fur meinen deutsches Freundin, dies ist ein sehr gut Film.

Having bought this movie for $[...] at a retail store, my expectations were extremely low. I was afraid I had bought yet another homemoad video reocrder disaster. Then when I learned it was actually a German film, my interest rose. German is my secondary language, and it was nice to be able to buy a German film DVD in Region 1. Now if America would only release Anok, I would be happy indeed. ANyway, back to the movie.

This movie is funny, very very funny. I loved it. You got a trio of misfits at a typical high school. You got Conrad, who looks like a studious, nerdy Marilyn Manson, a California looking stoner, and a dweebish sort of guy who isn't really a nerd, but isn't all that cool either.

Well after a voodoo ritual goes wrong (Dweeb really wanted a love potion for the blonde hottie Usi), the trio crash their van while pot smoking and end up in the morgue. They do pretty well as Zombies, but COnrad has a taste for human flesh now and eats his homosexual, disciplinarian gym teacher. Dweeb begs the girl next door for help. They make a potion and get back to normal.

However their is an alternate ending which I think was better. It is in the Extra bonus section and is in German only. However if you watch the movie, and then watch the alternate ending, you can pretty much tell what is going on, since it is mostly action.

As far as frights go, this movie has none, but if you want a laugh out loud teenage comedy, Night of the Living Dorks is a must.",1211155200,,1621,4.354304635761589

In watching this film, I'm not sure I describe it better than the press release information..

Philip and his best friends Konrad and Weener are the three biggest losers at Frederich Nietzsche High. But when an inept voodoo ceremony by the local Goth clique leads to a fatal car accident, this trio of ber-dorks returns as indestructible zombies with an insatiable appetite for human flesh, wild parties and gym class revenge. Can Philip now score with the hottest girl in school before he decomposes? Is there any personal dismemberment that can't be fixed with a stapler? And even if an antidote can be found, will it damper the uninhibited highlife of the undead? There's tortured bullies, wild parties, virgin blood, sex, drugs, rock & roll and more in this international horror.

Yep, it's all there.  You can't miss the stench of C class horror that is so desperately appealing that it must be watched.  But that's what Cult classics are about.  If you can't tell your friends how good it was, then it's not worth watching!

8157230,4,B000KJTFHA,"Night of the Living Dorks (2004)
 Imagine something like Ferris Buellers Day Off, Fast Times at Ridgemont High or some other typical teen comedy with all the usual jocks, stoners, Goths, high status kids at the top and the geeks with pocket protectors then throw in Zombies and you get the gist of this German comedy.  It works too.  The kids attend the German high school Frederich Nietzsche Gymnasium.  Heh heh.
 Tino Mewes plays the head nerd, too shy to make a move on his childhood friend-now beautiful and blossoming next door and just waiting for him.  He of course has eyes for an unobtainable top tier girl with the usual handsome jock jerk boyfriend.  When the Goth girl (Collen Frenandes) and her pals invoke some Zombie ashes, three dorks (Mewes, Manuel Cortez and Thomas Schmieder) are Zombiefied.
 These are fully functioning Zombies who not only have gained super strength but also have x-ray vision which they use, remember these are 17 year old boys, to look at girls butts.  Night of the Living Dorks has not just imagination and enthusiasm but competence rarely seen in Zombie flicks.  The production company, Constantin Films, has a long history in the film business, making movies in German and in English.  It has produced such famous films as The Never Ending Story, The Name of the Rose but for our purposes much more importantly, Constantin Films made the Resident Evil films.  In short, Night of the Living Dorks is a major production by a large and successful film production company.  It has the professional level in the technical departments that we always seek and only occasionally find.  That alone sets this film above the usual stagger of the horde.
 Writer/director/ producer Mathias Dinter has produced for us a very entertaining teen comedy romp-with Zombies.  We have frequent reasons to laugh with lots of little funny bits, some of which hit the spot and some of which dont.  Most do hit.  For some reason his directorial career peaked with Night and he never directed again but he has continued a career as a writer, mostly in German TV.
 The players all have professional credits, if varying degrees of success.  Of the three geeks, Portuguese/German actor Manuel Cortez still works in show biz but more often behind the scenes.  Thomas Schmieder has amassed 9 credits.  But leading man Tino Mewes has an astonishing 50 credits and he still a young fellow.  For his work in Night of the Living Dorks he garnered the nomination for Best Young Comedian from Austrias Undine Awards (and no, I never heard of the Undine Awards either-but better to be nominated than not, no?)  His leading lady, the exotic Indian/Hungarian beauty Collen Fernandes who played the Goth girl next door has a busy life as an actress, a model, a recording artist and a dancer.
 With such an arresting title I had to see Night of the Living Dorks and watched it with pleasure.  I give it an extra high rating of three and a half brains.  It works as a Zombie movie and as a teen comedy romp.  Not that it has much originality as a teen movie, but by now which films do?  We have the familiar themes played out against the troubles of our protagonists dealing with teen angst and disintegrating body parts.
 On the DVD viewers have the chance to see an alternate ending, of which I will say no more.
 Fun fact-At the beginning of the movie we have a brief scene set in Haiti where in a Zombie is turned to ash.  Later this ash is used to Zombiefy the three dorks.  The actor that played the Haitian Zombie also played a small role in Resident Evil.  I thought you might like to know.",1443052800,,3598,4.658730158730159

It's got teen losers in it who are trying to get laid who just happen to become zombies as well.  So instead of going to a hospital or a government agency looking for help, they go to school like everything is normal.  Of course they can enlist the aid of the local goth hottie to help them out with their little zombie problem.  And once they convince her that there is a problem and that they are actually zombies, what do they do?  Why they throw a party of course!  Why not?  I mean it's not like there is a time limit on how long they have to turn human again or anything.  Oh wait there is, like 36 hours or something.  But who cares!  We've got a party to throw!

Plus we have the obligatory scene where one of the losers hooks up with the hottest chick at his school and we get a topless scene because all teen movies have those these days.  But the best part of the movie?  Why the ""80's cleaning things up montage!""  Gotta love those!
