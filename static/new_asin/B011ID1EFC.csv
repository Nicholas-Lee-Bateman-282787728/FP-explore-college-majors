7333294,5,B011ID1EFC,"This movie marks a high point for independent filmmaking. The director, Joe Clarke, working with limited resources, produced a high-quality family film that carefully weaves humor with a compelling storyline to make for a final product everyone can love or at least appreciate.

With a little more resources, this film could've easily been the next Christmas classic reminiscent of Home Alone. This movie will captivate every child who still holds on to the magic of that sacred holiday, and will likely draw in adults who refuse to let the kid inside of them die.

Up On The Wooftop, allows viewers an honest glimpse at the promise of Joe Clarke as a filmmaker, an up and coming artist with blockbuster potential. This film showcases his technical ability, his homage to the traditional holiday storyline while creatively deviating just enough to be unique, and perhaps his defining skill: the ability to make the viewer laugh through all situations. He can make even the serious moments, where he tries to impart a lesson to his audience, painfully humorous.

Gather your kids and loved ones around the 'ole tube and give this heartwarming film a shot. If not for the talking dog, do it for Mr. Belding - Dennis Haskins - who plays Santa Claus.",1447804800,9,1246,4.895734597156398
7333295,5,B011ID1EFC,A great family movie for the holidays! Toby is an adorable pup with a lot of heart. My kids absolutely loved this holiday treat! Loved the comedy of Leroy the elf who goes looking for Toby and the two bungling crooks.,1447804800,3,217,4.317073170731708

7333303,4,B011ID1EFC,"This little film has a lot of heart. Santa, talking dogs, cute kids -- what more could you ask for from a holiday movie? :) Sure, it's not a big budget production with big stars, but the movie hits the right notes as a fun diversion for the holidays (or any time of year, for that matter!) and Toby, the adorable talking pup, is the real draw here anyway! Also, Up On The Wooftop was given the Dove Seal of Approval as a family friendly film so parents don't need to worry about letting the kiddies watch the movie in terms of it having any objectionable content. All that and a great price? I think I've found another awesome stocking stuffer!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-On-The-Wooftop/dp/B011ID1EFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up On The Wooftop</a>",1447632000,11,800,5.307086614173229
