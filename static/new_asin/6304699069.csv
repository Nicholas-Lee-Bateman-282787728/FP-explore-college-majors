914294,5,6304699069,I love this one so much. I am a Troma Superfan so this one holds a special place in my heart. Every time I spray my house with pesticides I think of this movie. Wish there would have been a part 2.,1410480000,,197,3.7142857142857144
914295,4,6304699069,"This film is about some exterminators who accidentally mutate crickets into giant killer bugs with their new poison gas.

This is not that bad of a movie, at least compared to other Troma films (for example: Demented Death Farm Massacre, Rockabilly Vampire, Deadly Daphne's Revenge, etc.). And you don't have to be black to like it either, I'm living proof. It's a pretty engaging feature to say the least; I let my friend borrow it once and he said that it was the 2nd worst movie he had ever seen, BUT it was the only movie I loaned him that he didn't fall asleep at (others included Evil Dead 1 & 2).

Don't expect a straight-up horror or sci-fi movie, this is a comedy (a creature-comedy). It has lots of pretty dumb jokes (my favorite kind) and dumb antics in it as well. I'm smiling right now just thinking about the cockroach art project the exterminators had to do.

If there's one thing you should learn about Troma movies, it is don't take their word for anything. Although Lloyd Kaufman did say this is the director's cut version, it's still a PG-13 movie. Also, there is an easter-egg featuring Lloyd and the movie's director (& Toxie, & Kabukiman) saying that this is a perfect movie for Halloween. Well, it's not. Scary movies are perfect for Halloween, this is perfect for a lazy day.

As with all cheesy low-budget horror movies, this shouldn't be taken seriously. This is probably the reason why a lot of people didn't like it. Just don't expect a masterpiece, have fun with it.",1213228800,,1495,4.588014981273409
914296,3,6304699069,"Troma is my favorite movie studio. Sure most of there movies really suck but alot of them are entertaining and worth at least a look at. I was looking at this movie for awhile and during a Troma movie buying binge, I got this movie. Its PG-13 but does still have some decent gore. I hate bugs so that is probably why it was creepy for me. It was alright and one of the better Troma movies ive seen.",1200355200,,398,4.050632911392405
914297,1,6304699069,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't even give it credit for being a fun Grade B Creature Feature because it just isn't. I realize one doesn't expect great acting from these movies, but we could at least have some over-acting! The special effects weren't even laughably bad, just bad. The bugs were utterly ridiculous; I'm surprised we didn't see the hands that manipulated them in a few scenes.

I'm sure there's an audience for this movie. But not at our house.",1172016000,,485,4.574712643678161
914298,3,6304699069,"Greetings From TroMinneapolis
During the mid-ninties, Troma released several films that changed the public's perception of the company, and the company itself, for the better. Films like ""Tromeo and Juliet"" and ""Cannibal! The Musical"" went on to great commercial and critical success, and are now considered classics amongst both the indepentdent film fanatics, and the sophisticated curious lovers of cinema throughout the world. Their tremendous success shadowed three other films that appeared as coming distractions on both tapes. Those films were ""Frostbiter: Wrath of the Wendigo,"" ""Wizards of the Demon Sword,"" and ""Bugged."" Troma went all out throughout October 1996 to promote ""Bugged,"" a thriller about exterminators who must rid a house of big disgusting insects aimed at all ages for the Halloween season, and although some embraced it, others either rejected it for not being another ""Tromeo,"" or ignored it. Six years later, Troma releases the ""Bugged"" DVD, which brings up the question, ""Is this Bug worth revisiting?""
The last time I viewed the film was during the summer of 2000, after seeing one of Troma's other recent DVD Re-releases ""Buttcrack,"" a classic by all means. After an enjoyable and informative introduction by ""Bugged"" star Pricilla Basque, Director Ronald K. Armstrong, and Tromallah Lloyd Kaufman,(which thankfully also appears on the DVD) I was ready for another wonderfully Tromatic expierence. Boy, was I ever dissappointed.
Bear in mind, my viewing conditions wern't exactly optimum. The sound quality on VHS was TERRIBLE, the picture wasn't exactly clear, and the certain Tromatic charm that seems to come with most Troma Movies just wasn't there.
It gives me great pleasure to say that, for the DVD, all of those problems have been corrected.
This exterminator of a film has gassed out all the bugs and now contains crisp, clear sound, a bright, stylish picture, and yes, that good ol' Tromatic Charm.
As far as for the entertainment value of the film, while not bad, it isn't quite great either. Some scenes are slow, some dialogue falls flat, and the film feels like RKA just didn't give it that extra push it needs up the hill of enjoyable cinema.
But the film isn't without it's great moments. The special effects seem campy at first, but the actors' reactions and intricate placing coupled with the overall style thrusts you into a world where the bugs seem, at times, real. Also, there are several memorable quotes, delightful antics, and a handful of genuine real scares.
The DVD has the usual deluxe Troma presentation. Aside from the old VHS intro I mentioned earlier (which now appears in the special features as ""Buggin' Out with Lloyd & Ron""), there is a new intro that involves Lloyd Kaufman, President of Troma Studios and Creator of the Toxic Avenger, singing ""Bugged""s praises, taking shots at ""Men In Black II,"" a plug for Troma's ""Def By Temptation,"" and a couple puns you can't help but burst out laughing after hearing.
The DVD also contains the original ""Bugged"" trailor, several other Troma Trailors, a mediocre at best Director's commentary, on/off English subtitles, and one of my new favorite DVD Easter Eggs. I'm not going to spoil the suprise, but the Easter Egg alone is worth the price of the DVD.
Overall, is ""Bugged"" worth the cost of reinfesting it in my house? The answer is a hesitant yes. Even if you wind up hating the film, there's still enough extras on here to not make your time a complete waste. Also, it is necessary viewing for anyone who witnessed the technically inept VHS expecting something more. Therefore, this film is only worth is if you purchase the DVD. Otherwise, squash it.",1035590400,3,3668,5.024630541871921

7876136,3,6304699069,"I'm a huge fan of new, inventive, independent filmmakers, and ""Bugged!"" creator and director Ronald K. Armstrong is all of those three. He also stars as literary exterminator Dave, who with his team takes on a cricket infestation in the remote home of a famous and beautiful poet, Divine (Priscilla K. Basque). I love the concept, and although the acting and production values will win no awards, it's still cheesy B-movie fun. The film opens with a run of the mill chemical waste and laboratory experiment gone horribly awry subplot complete with scenes of speed typing and a hilarious mutant mouse puppet. This is more problematic than it sounds as it's all background to set up the central giant cricket plot and it just drags on an on. Finally, the noxious chemical comes into the possession of some exterminators in a wholly realistic way and they immediately decide to spray the leading lady's house with it.

Along the way we get to a subplot that was my favorite part of the film, namely an insect-themed diorama building contest. That's a cinematic first I feel confident! Even though it takes half an hour to get the exterminators to meet the crickets, the pacing-challenged introduction is worth the yawns, as the film gets into high gear thereafter and the body count and the crickets continue to grow. I love the concept that an exterminator would recognize a celebrity poet, but after romance flourishes and subplots about papyrus and oatmeal are quickly introduced it becomes obvious that one of the crickets has learned to use a gun. I am not kidding. I could not have laughed harder at that moment and went back and watched it several more times. After faux poetry lover and fellow hero exterminator Steve (Jeff Lee) is turned into a skeleton in shocking way, it's all up to Dave to save the damsel in distress and take her away from the nightmare. Do you think he succeeds? I won't tell, but I bet you can guess.

The film has some bad acting especially in the introduction, but I thought that for their level of experience that Armstrong, Basque, and Billy Graham (no not that Billy Graham) as Gunther gave the most spirited performances. The DVD has several extras including a conversation between Lloyd Kaufman and Ron Armstrong which I really enjoyed. I appreciated Armstrong's candor and good humor, and thought he said something interesting when he said that he ""wanted to make a Troma film from an African-American point of view."" I get his point about the relative lack of minorities in other Troma productions, but to his credit he was creatively nuanced enough to make the film enjoyable by anyone who loves B-movies. There is also a director's commentary track, but it's very hard to hear Armstrong at times, which is too bad as he's an interesting guy with a lot to say about making low budget films. There's also a slide show, outtakes, and trailers, which are all par for the course.

""Bugged!"" is a rough early effort from a young filmmaker, and despite its obvious low budget I enjoyed it a great deal. It's silly and fun, and does Troma credit: it's not excessively gory and what violence there is is fairly cartoonish. I gave it three stars overall for pacing missteps in the first third of the film, but hang in there, the last two thirds are worth waiting for if you're a lover of camp cinema.",1435968000,2,3331,4.719931271477663
