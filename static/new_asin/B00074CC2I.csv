2200062,1,B00074CC2I,"This movie appears to have no rating but I wouldn't recommend watching it for those who have any sense of morals and decency and are Christian.  The description on the box does give a clue however.  It mentions lusty trysts and that is indeed what occurs here.  Tadeusz appears to be lusting after Telimena who is in turn is lusting after him.  You can see that she gives him the key to her room and in the middle of the night he goes in to her.  Just about throughout the whole movie, this Telemina wears about the lowest cut dress she can get away with.  Even worse, in one scene the camera zooms in on her bosom to emphasize the lust of Tadeusz and her seductive dress.  Here is a woman who is old enough to be his mother.  Then this Tadeusz dumps her for the much younger (14 year old!) Zosia and goes off and marries her in the end.  As a Polish-American, I am embarrassed that this is the best that an epic poem by Adam Mickiewicz can produce assuming that the movie is faithful to the book.  The family feud is an embarrassment also where the Warden had nothing on his mind but rage and revenge for the Slopica family.  This feud leads to almost bloodshed but later there is bloodshed as the Poles and the Russians mindlessly slaughter each because of an insult to the Major of the Russian troops.  I gave it one star for its immodesty, otherwise I would have rated it higher.  I would give it zeros stars if I could.  It seems that movie makers can't produce much of anything nowadays if it doesn't have sex or violence in it.",1251936000,4,1534,4.28125
2200063,4,B00074CC2I,"Andrej Wajda's Pan Tadeusz - pronounced, roughly ""Pon Tadoosh"", meaning 'Sir Thaddeus' - is based on the namesake poem by Adam Mickiewicz, and covers the life of the young Count Tadeusz in the era right before Napoleon invades. Around this illustrious figure, a cast of glittering characters swirls; a vengeful warden, a flirtatious aunt, feuding nobility, a priest with a secret to hide, all looking forward to the one event which promises to change their lives forever: the invasion of Napoleon, and the throwing off of Russian imperialism. Pan Tadeusz is a Romeo & Juliet style love story; Tadeusz, member of one warring family, falls in love with Zosia, of the other, to marry such that the ancient land feud will be settled so the war can be turned on the Russians.

Visually, Pan Tadeusz is amazing. Every scene is a treat to the eyes, from the verdant forests to the east-meeets-west Sarmatian decorations that adorn every house. Wajda has come very close to capturing the essence of the beauty of the fatherland that Mickiewicz conveyed in his epic poem.

The acting, too, is top notch, bringing together much of Poland's finest talent to tell this important story. Pan Tadeusz has many major characters, but the viewer becomes intimately familiar with them all by the end of the movie.

The story is compelling, too, especially for anyone with an understanding of Polish History. Once, Poland was a great nation, one that defeated the Ottoman Empire in war, and crushed Russia in another. Yet, as Prussia, Austria, and Russia rose to power, they saw Poland as an easy victim, and jointly conquered the nation in 1772 in a series of Partitions. Russia took the lion's share, and ever since, Poland resisted their control. Pan Tadeusz takes place in 1811-12, when Napoleon swept across Europe, and through Poland, giving the Poles a chance to rise up and ressurect their nation as the mighty Fenix. Yet, as the film closes, Napoleon's army is marching to its doom in Russia. For Poles, this film is deeply nostalgic, harkening back to the days when Pole resisted Russian. Indeed, Poland only became free of Russian control in 1989, with the fall of the Soviet Union, which is to say that all of the adult viewers in Poland know personally what it meant to resist Russian control. For they, like the characters of Pan Tadeusz, rose up against their Russian oppressors.

The film is not without a major flaw. Pan Tadeusz is extremely slow, running at 2.5 hours when it could have been trimmed down to 2 hours. Wajda included a number of scenes which add nothing to the movie, though were important in the poem. Among these is a slow-motion mushroom picking scene, several scenes focusing on the same swamp scenery (with no action), a five-minute long Polska dance scene which could have been 15 seconds, and so forth. Much of this could have been cut without hurting the movie, and in the process made it more engaging.

Pan Tadeusz is a foreign film, so will open doors to another culture for those willing to step through. In one movie, you get a sense of the basic struggle inherent in Polish history 1772-1989, a struggle of people more devoted to liberty than any other. The subtitles which guide you through this journey are top notch, and very little meaning is lost in translation. This may be because Pan Tadeusz is based on the verses of its namesake epic poem, as are the carefully worked out translations. Thus, the dialogue in both Polish and English is rich and poetic.

I fully recommend Pan Tadeusz for anyone interested in understanding something of another culture, but do come to the movie with an open mind.",1148169600,21,3632,4.793929712460064

8044641,5,B00074CC2I,"""Pan Tadeusz"" is a treasure of Polish literature, perhaps comparable in American culture  to ""Gone With The Wind"" in literature, or ""The Star Spangled Banner"" in music. It was written around 1830 by Adam Mickiewicz (1798-1855) who was what we would call their poet laureate, and was also a national hero, at a time when Poland (also called ""Lithuania"") was occupied by Russia. Poles had placed their hopes in vain in Napoleon to liberate their nation. Mickiewicz recognized the weakness of Poles to be their concern for personal affairs and an inability to work together for a larger cause. This theme is worked out in a conflict of two families over a piece of property, along with small land holders taking sides.

What the casual English-speaker will not detect is that the Polish version is in rhyming verse (150 pages in the original). This is possible in Polish, perhaps more-so than any other language, in that Polish is not word-order-dependent. (Neither is Russian, but the latter prefers the most natural word order.)  For the movie version, long discussions on art and nature have been edited out leaving the most relevant scenes, but still two and a half hours worth.

The book is available in book stores, including a version with Polish and English text side-by-side.  (You could do a lot worse than learning some Polish which 1930-60 was second language in the US.)

An aside:  take note of the oddly modern livery worn by servants on horseback accompanying their employer.",1352073600,,1488,4.928
8044642,4,B00074CC2I,"This is a fantastic historical film of Adam Mickiewicz's epic poem, Pan Tadeusz, which deals with the petty squabbles of two noble families before Napoleon's invasion of Russia and how they come together to fight against the Russians.  The cinematography was very beautiful and you really get a sense of the landscape.  Other people have given the plot synopsis, so I'll just mention that it was very engaging.  However, I'm sure it's better if you've already read the poem.  I have to admit I haven't.  Sometimes the narrative was a bit difficult to follow, and it is true that there were some over long scenes. Sometimes there were typos in the English subtitles. However, despite these issues, it is a film worth seeing, even for those who haven't read the poem.",1283904000,,765,4.809160305343512
8044643,5,B00074CC2I,"This is one of the best film adaptations of a work of Polish literature I've seen.  It really brings the book to life.  The movie is beautifully filmed, with plenty of picturesque scenes of the countryside.  The casting was perfect, and the acting was fantastic.  Everyone was exactly the way I envisioned them in the book.  I particularly enjoyed Boguslaw Linda as the monk Robak.  He really captured the character of a monk/soldier trying to reconcile two feuding families while fostering a grass roots uprising against the Russians.  The movie also paid attention to the little details that make the book so charming, such as the grandfather clock that plays Dabrowski's Mazurka and Robak's snuff box with the portrait of Kosciusko.

I also thought the movie did an unusually good job of conveying the spirit of the work.  Mickiewicz wrote Pan Tadeusz as an exile in Paris, and the work was meant to be a consoling and idealized account of his lost country.  To that end, the movie begins with Mickiewicz and his fellow ex-pats in a dreary room in Paris.  Mickiewicz, speaking lines drawn from the epilogue of Pan Tadeusz, begins to entertain his friends by narrating the story.  The movie ends back in Paris, with Mickiewicz delivering the famous opening verse, ""Litwo, ojczyzno moja...,"" which was quite poignant.  Mickiewicz narrates throughout, which gives the movie that fairy-tale like feeling the book has.  I thought it was wonderfully done.

The script is drawn from the text of the poem, and it's a real pleasure to hear Mickiewicz's beautiful language spoken aloud.  Linda in particular does an excellent job of delivering lines in rhymed couplets in such a way as to bring out the poetry while being utterly convincing as speech.  The scenes that stand out in my mind are when Robak takes leave of the judge (""Kto wie, czy wroce zywy! kto wie, co sie stanie / W Dobrzynie! Bracie! wielkie, wielkie zamieszanie! / Ten wariat Hrabia! slysze, pobiegl do Dobrzyna, / Nie moglem go uprzedzic, wazna w typ przyczyna: / stary Maciek mnie poznal..."") and Robak's final scene with Gerwazy (""Ja skarzyc nie mam prawa, ja jego morderca / Ja skarzyc nie mam prawa, przebaczam mu z serca / Ale i on..."").  The lines are delivered in an unaffected manner, full of emotion, and with an absolute awareness of the beauty of the language.

The humor of the book also comes through, particularly in the character of the Count, who, being so steeped in Romanticism, is completely divorced from reality.  I love his scenes with Gerwazy, particularly the one in which Gerwazy is planning the foray against the Soplicas while the Count comments on how such a Gothic-Sarmatian plan appeals to his imagination, and inquires whether the castle for which they're fighting has any dungeons.

This movie was clearly made by people who love the book.  For those who loved the book, you'll love the movie.  Those who haven't read the book should still see the movie, which is visually spectacular and tells an engaging story.",1260144000,10,3009,4.8799212598425195
