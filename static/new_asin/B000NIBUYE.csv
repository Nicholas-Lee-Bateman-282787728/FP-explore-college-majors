Belongs on my all time worst movie list.",1420675200,,156,4.064516129032258
8177899,3,B000NIBUYE,"Not real bad, but not very good either.
This is the type of Western that was made for no other purpose than to fill the bottom half of a drive-in double or triple bill. On the cheap (very cheap), quickly, in b&w and without any big name stars. The type of picture that almost always turned a profit simply because it couldn't help not to.

But even so, times were changing and television was quickly putting an end to this type of film. Westerns of this type were plentiful on the small screen and boasted the same look and budget. GUN FIGHT looks like a television episode from some lost Western series with location stock shots and much of the action taking place on obvious sound stages.

That doesn't mean this movie stinks or isn't worthwhile, but it pretty much condemns it to mediocrity. James Brown, an ex-cavalry officer, meets pretty saloon gal Joan Staley aboard a stagecoach that is held up by an outlaw gang lead by Jim's masked brother Gregg Palmer. Before it's over both brothers join forces on a cramped studio lot fending off the outlaw onslaught, with an occasional side step onto an outdoor set.

The acting is ok, the best coming from bad brother Gregg Palmer and his henchie, soon to be perennial tv bad guy, Ron Soble. The print and transfer are great! Sharp and clear although the audio appeared a little muffled. If you're a fan of Westerns and need to see mostly everything available I can recommend this film for your collection as you will most likely find something to like here. I did...I really liked the scene when James Brown returns to the Jackson Hole trading post from pelt hunting and he brushes off the snow covering him once inside the post. The snow is obviously those little white packing pellets and he looks as if he just can't seem to shake those styrofoam snowflakes.

All in all, a pleasant enough Western to occupy your afternoon with. Just expect something more akin to a tv episode of TOMBSTONE TERRITORY rather than something like RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.",1389657600,,2002,4.615168539325842
8177900,4,B000NIBUYE,"This movie is GUNFIGHT,it seems all the other reviews are for the movie entitled A GUN FIGHT which is completely different. Gunfight was made in 1960,and is about two brothers,one of which is an outlaw and a misunderstanding between them. Which leads to the GUNFIGHT. It is a B western with many of the same sets being used more than once, just a table cloth added here and curtins there,and it another room. Some of the acting is a little corny at times. However,I enjoyed this film. It is Black and White and is approx 65 minutes.",1371600000,,532,4.494845360824742
8177901,3,B000NIBUYE,"Gun Fight is not a bad western for the right price. The transfer is a 4 out of 5. Its a b&w 70 minute full frame movie. The acting,scenery,and storyline is good. The right price helps this western...support your favorite srtists.",1368921600,,229,4.609756097560975
8177902,4,B000NIBUYE,"This movie is not the best of westerns during the days, but it's decent to own. The acting is pretty good, except there are a few flaws with the scenery. Gun Fight is filmed in Full Screen format, is in BW with a really good transfer by MGM and runs for about 69min (1hr 9min). Overall this is a good movie to have for your collection. I would recommend this to anyone.",1331424000,,369,4.138888888888889
8177903,3,B000NIBUYE,"GUNFIGHT,  a movie I was happy to add to my collection. A good film for 1961, believable story, good acting, James brown plays his part well, as does Gregg Palmer who plays the outlaw brother. I like the western genre and I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any other western fan.",1287705600,3,291,4.388888888888889

SYNOPSIS--
While traveling on the westbound stagecoach, retired cavalryman Wayne Santley becomes friendly with a dance hall hostess named Nora Blaine. Santley's plans to join brother Brad at his ranch are ruined when Wayne discovers his brother is a cattle rustler. Instead, Wayne takes a job at a trading post and eventually he marries Nora.

A cohort of Brad's convinces him that Wayne was the one who led the sheriff to Brad's hideout. When Brad finds out the traitor was actually another man, he joins Wayne on a brotherly fur trapping expedition, but Brad's old gang is now after Wayne AND him.
