7883629,3,6305113114,this was not as good as the other Christmas concerts. it felt wooden or lacked something which I cant put a word to,1388966400,,115,4.043478260869565
7883630,5,6305113114,"This is an early concert of Andre' Rieu after his break through success.  It is recorded in Holland and has
an English introduction by Andre', then subtitles during the concert because it was done in Dutch.  The
music is traditional Christmas music.  I enjoyed watching it.",1386115200,,273,4.891304347826087
7883631,5,6305113114,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-I-Love/dp/B0062WR80U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas I Love</a>This is a very enjoyable dvd of Christmas music by Andre Rieu and his Orchestra.  I received my copy the other day and noted it looked the same as a prior Andre Rieu Christmas dvd.  I had purchased ""Christmas with Andre Rieu"" a few years ago, and compared the two dvds and they are the same with the exception of one song.  So, in my opinion, if you have the previously released ""Christmas With Andre Rieu"", you don't really need this release as it is essentially a re-release of ""Christmas With Andrew Rieu"". If you do not already have the previous release, then I highly recommend this release.",1335571200,7,744,5.566371681415929
7883632,5,6305113114,"""The Christmas I Love"" is a lovely collection of standard Christmas carols and holiday-themed classical pieces performed by Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra. It's an understated and enchanting collection of holiday music that captures the warmth and love of the season.

As stated on the reverse of the video itself:

For years it has been a dream of mine to record all the beautiful Christmas songs that I know with my own orchestra.  It is bound up with a lot of personal memories, such as serving as an alter boy at three masses in a row or singing as the highest boy soprano in the church choir at midnight mass.  - Andre Rieu
