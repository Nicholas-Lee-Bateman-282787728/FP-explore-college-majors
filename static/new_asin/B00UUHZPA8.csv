7071290,3,B00UUHZPA8,A great low budget sci-fi flick that scared the pants off me at the Hurstville Civic when I saw it as a kid. Good to see it get a DVD release at last. But these DVD-R on demand items are pretty pricey for just the movie. Maybe they could include some sub-titles for a change?,1435017600,2,275,4.0181818181818185

7071293,3,B00UUHZPA8,"Spoilers!  Space probe rover fails after 11 minutes on Mars.  Scientist leaves Cape Canaveral to spend a late Christmas with his estranged wife and family in the guest house of a California mansion.  They are all gradually replaced by energy beings who finally leave the grounds to ensure that other countries don't ""invade"" their planet.

Studio film made on low budget is creepy with few special effects.  Atmospheric if that is your taste.",1430697600,5,442,5.0

7071296,3,B00UUHZPA8,"Don't buy this if you want monsters and fast paced action (or if you demand things ""happening"" in general...) but if atmosphere and weird movies are your thing this could interest you. I actually enjoyed it, but then one of my favorites are Last Year in Marienbad. This is pretty much without the intellectual challenge, of course, in fact quite moronic at times, but the french classic was clearly an influence. I imagine this was made more for the love of movies than for money. Still, springing this on innocent unsuspecting american youths, what were they thinkig?",1428192000,2,568,4.865979381443299

7071298,4,B00UUHZPA8,It is a tribute to someone on the crew that a picture shot in one of Hollywood's most beautiful mansions can give you the creeps in broad daylight. The picture lingers in the memory in strange ways long after you've seen it. The image should be a little sharper but is not objectionable. Remarkable for it's budget.,1427846400,8,315,4.543859649122807
7071299,4,B00UUHZPA8,"Here's a nice treat for classic sci-fi movie fans who think they've seen it all.  Previously available in a cropped, public-domain print from Sinister Cinema, The Day Mars Invaded Earth finally makes its official widescreen debut.  Like all these made-on-demand titles, all you get is the movie.  No bonus features or even scene selections.  Just hit ""play"" and enjoy.

The film itself, while not quite a classic, is a good example of story over special effects (there are virtually none to be found here).  Owing its basic plot to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/B007Y1NNAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>&nbsp;or, maybe slightly more to the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Married-a-Monster-from-Outer-Space/dp/B001440WB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Married a Monster from Outer Space</a>, it's a rather talky film.  But it takes itself seriously, and it doesn't wear out its welcome.

I've owned the Sinister version for several years, and I can definitely say that Fox's print, while not quite pristine, is a significant improvement.  If you happen to be a fan of the film--and I am--this is certainly the only version you need.  But it's more likely you're not familiar with it, so it's a minor gem to be discovered.",1426723200,25,1385,6.319148936170213
8708340,4,B00UUHZPA8,"This movie really surprised me. The main character is a scientist who invented/is in charge of a probe of Mars. His wife is disgruntled because he's never home / always working. She's from a wealthy family, and is living with their two children in a gatehouse of a vast estate her family's in the process of selling. The scientists goes home, but lots of strange things start happening. The movie is very slow building, and there are a lot of scenes of a single person slowly looking around the really vast estate house. The movie really plays like a very atmospheric ghost story. Ending very modern. I recommend it - with the luxury of a fast forward button. The alien portion of this movie is hard scifi.",1503532800,,706,4.566929133858268
8708341,1,B00UUHZPA8,"I agree with C. Dickins.  This movie had to have a zero budget. The initial scene is almost realistic. That was the Mars probe on Mars. It looked almost like it does today considering we had no idea how Mars looked in 1963.  But after that . . . Nothing. You could nap through the rest of it. People just running around the house or a garden, occasionally bumping into a double then wondering if it actually happened.  I think it was supposed to be like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers but with absolutely NO special effects budget. Thank goodness I didn't buy this. I caught it on FXM movie channel. This is one I need never see again.",1498694400,,635,4.319327731092437
8708342,4,B00UUHZPA8,"I saw this on TV and I just had to have it.  Sadly, there are no extras (and I rarely purchase film DVDs without them) but I knew this was a film I would want to watch every once in a while.  If you like lots of action, you will probably consider this too ""talky,"" but I'm fine with that.  If you've never seen this, be aware that the ending will stay with you for a long time.",1497657600,,377,3.8076923076923075
8708343,1,B00UUHZPA8,"ZERO STARS. This is a truly terrible movie. I love 50's B & W sci-fi. I have a collection. I was really looking forward to this, despite some of the review warnings. But please DO pay attention to this review warning: Don't buy this movie! It is  a) REALLY boring- nothing happens except for people bumping into each other around a drained swimming pool  b) completely PLOTLESS. There is no plot. Somehow something alien gets into this family and ultimately they die- they apparently get electrified inside the drained swimming pool  c) Clearly the movie was made on SUCH a low budget that it's sometimes hard to believe it cost anything at all. There's a cast of 6, a sort-of office, a sort-of livingroom and a lot of paths and bushes and the drained swimming pool. That's it. Serves me right for buying this despite warnings. But please do take my advice. I'm not even giving this away. I always keep all movies, no matter how bad. This one I'm tossing.",1487376000,,955,4.573099415204679

8708345,3,B00UUHZPA8,"Uhhhhh, I am a huge van of Vintage Sci-Fi and I watch them multiple times. This one will get watched only once.  Supposedly, Martians come to earth and take human form, replicating people. Movie takes place almost entirely in one house. Low budget, yes, Bad Story, Yes.",1453939200,,269,4.723404255319149
8708346,1,B00UUHZPA8,Terrible movie.  Very poor rip-off of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Picture quality and case in excellent condition however.,1450915200,,127,5.631578947368421
8708347,3,B00UUHZPA8,not a great movie but needed for the old sci fi collection,1446595200,,58,3.9166666666666665
8708348,5,B00UUHZPA8,"Starts off in non-anamorphic mode and just before the Mars rover gets destroyed, it changes to anamorphic. At least it's not zoomed (1.85:1) that most TV stations are showing it at.",1437609600,,181,4.870967741935484
8708349,2,B00UUHZPA8,"It's very dull, nothing happens, a bit of cig smoking, some talk, but no ""Invasion of Earth"".  It has from The Narrow Margin (1952), Hellfire (1949), and The Killing (1956), Marie Windsor, who was age 45 here, but looks 52.  She was still cute, but doesn't have the acting chops to pull this snoozer through.  No one does here.

Still, get it to complete your 50's list of science fiction films.
