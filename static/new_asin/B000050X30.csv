1386772,3,B000050X30,"I have to say that Il Trovatore is one of my favourite Verdi Opera's, with a great mix of drama and suspense, twinned with the most unlikely of story lines! There are ample opportunities for the musicians and artists to shine, and some did in this production!
In particular, Dolora Zajick, much the best actor on the stage, gave a passionate and inspired performance as Azucena. She has a wonderfully resilient voice, and carried the role off superbly. I also enjoyed Sherrill Milnes' performance as the ""evil"" Count Luna. Milnes wouldn't be out of place as the baddy in one of those silent films twiddling his moustach! I found his powerful Baritone extremely convincing.
Pavarotti's voice is as agreeable as ever, but as usual his acting lets the overall performance down. He spends most of his time rooted to the spot with a perplexed look on his face! Mind you, I suppose if you've escaped death by fire at the hands of your mad gypsy mother at the age of 1, you'd look worried too!
Jeffrey Wells got better as he warmed up, but Eva Marton seemed totally out of place here with her ""the louder you sing the better"" approach. She was decidly flat in places, and didn't even attempt to sing some of the high notes, most noticeably at the end of act 1! The D'amour sull'ali rosee in scene 1 of act 4 is one of the most lovely solo's written by Verdi, however I'm afraid it was somewhat ""brutalised"" by Eva here, more subtley needed!
The sets were quite atmospheric, although everything obviously happened at night as it was so dark throughout! The Met orchestra were well controlled as usual by James Levine, although it was difficult to hear the singers at times - you often find this with some of Verdi's more dramtic moments!",1036454400,16,1729,4.598705501618123
1386773,2,B000050X30,"Oh, I had such high hopes for this one! I was, however, terribly disappointed. Forgetting the singers for a moment, let's concentrate on the sets. Dark and gloomy, with a pointless set of stairs dividing the stage in half. Basically, the sets were changed by moving around a bunch of ugly and useless columns. Apparently, this production was a cast-off of Joan Sutherland's, who hated it.
 Okay, moving on. The singers: Pavarotti was Pavarotti, singing fine but, my god, I've seen toddlers express more emotion over pet mosquitos they killed two seconds afterwards. I can't say it enough, his acting is painful!
 Eva Marton: This was my first exposure to Marton's voice, and if she is always like this, I'm hoping it's my last! Something went wrong with the tempo in ""di tale amor"" and many of her high notes were horribly flat. One in particular sticks out, at the end of her duet with the count, her last high note was spectacularly awful. Her acting is perfectly matched to Pavarotti's; need I say more?
 Sherril Milnes: Pretty good. His portrayal of the count is intelligent and human, but he should have retired years before. His top notes are strained, and he is obviously struggling with some problems, but on the whole, I really enjoyed his performance.
 Dolora Zajick: Gorgeous voice, very gorgeous voice. She acts relatively well, considering the plot, but she's at her best as Amneris in Aida. Still, very good, brava!
 So basically, the production has it's high points, (Zajick, Milnes) but mostly it consists of low points. Don't waste your money.",1028592000,17,1560,4.871698113207547
1386774,3,B000050X30,"The best things in this DVD are the superb singing of Milnes and Zajick, a very good performance of Metropolitan Chorus, and the conducting of Levine. Pavarotti sings well too, but he isn't a good actor here (in Rigoletto's DVD he is excellent as the Duca). Marton is the weak point of the production: too old for a plausible Leonora, and sometimes she doesn't sings in the right tempi. The scenario is very poor and dark (great scenarios you'll find in Metropolitan's Aida: incredible!).
However,is a worthy buy... especially for Verdi's fans. But we are all better served in productions of Rigoletto (Pavarotti, Gruberova, Wixell, Chailly) and Traviata (Gheorghiu, Lopardo,  Nucci, Solti). Let's wait for a almost perfect Trovatore in the future.",999475200,12,748,5.131147540983607
1386775,3,B000050X30,"It breaks my heart to admit that I agree with the vast majority of the reviewers.  Perfect sound, why wasn't this the case with the recently released Ballo?  But not a very well served document of Verdi's wonderful emotive opera.
OK, the production is dreadful - what were the Met thinking of?  It's like a production I would expect to see at the ENO in London.  Where they short of money that season, or did someone just want to get a kick out of watching perfomers attempt to navigate the set without falling over!!  Eva Marton is totally mis-cast as Leonora; it grieves me to say this because I adore her and have screamed myself hoarse at her perfomances of Turandot, Tosca and Elektra at Covent Garden - but here, oh dear.
Pavarotti sings wonderfully, as one would expect, but he seems totally oblivious to anyone else on stage - is it because he's worried that he might fall on those unnecessary stairs? Sherrill Milnes makes a good job as the Count de Luna and Dolora Zajick is just wonderful as Azucena - buy it just to see and hear this exemplary performance.  What a superstar she is - even being able to make a moving performance in this shambles of a production.
Well, what else can I say?  One fabulously fantastic performance, two reasonable ones and a dreadfully miscast soprano.  What a mish mash and shambles of one of Verdi's greatest music dramas.  Please someone, find the master tapes of Pavarotti as the Troubador in Florence in 1990 - or in Saltzberg.
I cannot honestly  recommend this to you as great music drama - but there are somethings to commend it too - especially Dolora Zajik.
So there, I sit on the fence!!  Sorry.",982972800,71,1647,4.549152542372881
1386776,3,B000050X30,"I agree with one of the other reviewers that the choice of Eva Marton for Leonora wasn't the best.  You notice right away in her first cabaletta, which is pretty bad.  The first act trio, though, rocks the hiz-ouse.  Sherill Milnes demonstrates much vocal bad-assery.  ""Il balen"" is great.  Pavarotti is okay too.  Warning, though:  This performance has cuts and transpostions.  The cabalettas don't have repeats, and Di quella pira is transposed down a half step.  So if you're looking for the high C, look elsewhere.",978048000,15,518,4.930232558139535
1386777,3,B000050X30,"Dolora Zajick is amazing and blows the roof off the house as Azucena.  Pavarotti's voice rings like a bell. Sherrill Milnes is incomparable. If you could only delete Eva Marton this would be 5 stars.  But it is still worth purchasing just to Dolora Zajick sing ""Nostre Monte"" and the final scene with pyrotechnics and all.",977529600,5,322,4.732142857142857
1386778,5,B000050X30,"Verdi can be a challenge both vocally and in terms of acting, but Pavarotti and Marton are sensational, and Milnes was still excellent although clearly near the end of his career.  The lyric beauty is there side by side with the dramatic power.  It's a shame DVD technology did not arrive earlier in all of their careers.",1395878400,,321,4.614035087719298
1386779,5,B000050X30,"Luciano Pavarotti is brilliant as Manrico. And Dolora Zajick is equally brilliant as Azucena. Sherrill Milnes may have been getting a bit old at this point, but he still sounded great as the Count di Luna. Some of the reviewers here didn't like Eva Marton as Leonora. But I think that she was wonderful in the role. A couple of the higher notes were transposed down for her, but she sang with great beauty. She has a powerful voice, and it worked well in her portrayal of the character. She didn't sing flat, she was right on key. And she is a pretty good actress. I also don't care if she and Pavarotti were no longer young. The important thing is that they were both great singers. The lead cast, the chorus, and the orchestra under the great James Levine were all magnificent. This is a classic performance of this masterpiece by Verdi.",1362441600,,839,4.490196078431373
1386780,4,B000050X30,"I had been avoiding this video recording for years because the reviews here are mostly mediocre at best.  I decided to watch it on the Met's website, and I was very pleasantly surprised, and equally entertained.  Here are my rebuttals to some of the common complaints:

Leonora - Eva Marton is hardly ""past her prime"" here as she has been labeled.  She was in her mid-forties, which is when a woman's voice is often at its best.  The Verdi repertoire is not her strength, and she misses some important notes, but her singing is still quite beautiful and powerful.  She also gives Leonora a depth of character that other sopranos who may sing this role better do not deliver. Her overall performance trumps the faults.

Manrico - It is fairly well known that Luciano Pavarotti's acting skills are not what made him famous. Yes, he stands and sings most of the time.  It does not seem to bother people much, and it certainly did not bother me here. His singing is fabulous.

Count di Luna - Sherril Milnes is a bit mature for this role, but the singing is still top-notch.  I would not call him a weak link.

The set - Simple, with different back drops added, making for easy and quick scene changes in this opera of four Acts with two scenes each.  No problem.

To sum up, this is good, old-fashioned grand opera from a house that is known for some of the best opera in the world.  I consider myself fairly picky, and I am not one to gush about every show I see.  This Trovatore has plenty to offer, and I believe I will watch it again to relive the thrill.  Recommended.",1255910400,17,1570,4.418118466898955
1386781,3,B000050X30,This was the video of an old performance of Il trovatore.  Well worth the price.,1249948800,,80,4.333333333333333
1386782,2,B000050X30,"As a production over all, this was definitely hard to stomach, an odd stage (though nothing too odd) and a dreadfully mismatched cast make it something I would not recommend.

Eva Marton is well past her prime at this point (and why she continues to sing to this day confuses me). As she struts around the stage missing notes, pushing her notes so hard it seems like she's about to cry (or generally explode). Forgetting that there is something called subtlety, she plays a Leonora who can be pitied it's true, but only because she still thinks she can play this role.  Admittedly Leonora is hard to cast, but Marton is dismal.

Pavarotti seems off his game, I can't quite put my finger on it but he seems distant, almost like he's forgotten that others are on stage and that there's an audience at all.  While all the notes are there his character seems to not be.  He was alright, but nothing like what he can be.  I'll admit though his ""Di quella pira"" was wonderful.

I don't know Milnes work particularly well, but opposite Pavarotti he doesn't overshadow him, nor is he overshadowed.  It's another average performance I suppose.

The highlight of the show is Dalora Zajick.  Absolutely stealing every moment of this show she's in.  Had I not seen her perform this well in at least ten other shows I would believe this was the role she was born to play.  Truly a master of the art, and alone almost enough to have me recommend this production.

This was my first exposure to Il Trovatore, and it wasn't until I bought the Milo, Domingo, Zajick, Morris CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Il-Trovatore/dp/B0000027UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Il Trovatore</a>&nbsp;that I began to see it's true beauty so stained was I to the opera upon having seen this production first.

In the end, an unfair representation of one of Verdi's greatest works.  I don't know any other DVDs that are good, (though that's only because of lack of exposure) but the CD I mentioned before is excellent if you are interested in only the music, and I'd recommend that well before this.",1244764800,2,2120,4.915730337078652
1386783,3,B000050X30,"Many parts in this opera seem mis-cast.  In particular, Eva Marton as Leonora was a bad choice.  I want a more girlish singer for the role of a young woman...not a late-middle aged matron with huge and glorious pipes.  Most of the characters were wooden and expressionless--Levine had more drama in his face than any of the players.  Pavarotti was incredible to listen to but very wooden to watch.  All of the players seemed to be watching their step all the time on that set. Zajik was the one singer who stood out to me.  Passionate, not just powerful; she took total possesion of the role.  One final complaint:  I thought the orchestra was too quiet on this disc.  I wanted to hear Verdi, not just his librettist.",1232409600,4,717,4.5390625
1386784,5,B000050X30,"I have never seen a better Il Travatore, with exciting singing all round and an emphasis on the role of fate. Pavarotti's duets with Dolora Zajick as the old gypsy are among the most affecting scenes in opera.",1210291200,6,209,4.526315789473684
1386785,5,B000050X30,"Now, we have a magnificent cast above all. Pavarotti looks simply divine, and his sparkle never leaves him. Eva Marton is generally regarded as ""miscast"", well maybe this is not a spinto part but her great, thrilling voice and subtle acting are always more than welcome. Milnes sings like a beautiful dream in his strong stage presence. And Zajick is simply awesome in her signature role. Wells is  a nice surprise as well.

Every one seems to hate this stage production.. But I simply adore it, and even consider it as the ideal stage production. Without forcing the singers to ""act"", it offers them a very comfortable stage which permits them to unleash their vocal powers to the highest point. while creating a unique atmosphere of darkness and tragedy with simple but effective lighting and very elegant (but not extravagant) stage designs, it imposes the whole power of Verdi's music on us who are never allowed thanks to masterful video direction by Brian Large, to focus on anything else but the singers who in their glamorous costumes are shining beautifully like their renditions, throughout this dream like production.

Recommended only for those who are looking for a solid opera production  which is inspired and colored by the music and nothing else but the music.

Karajan's Wiener production is a strong alternative which possess a more ""suitable"" cast but lacks the involvement and the music's dark atmosphere on stage that makes the met production such a powerful performance.

I can hardly wait for a dts re mastering that will allow this il trovatore to become an even more delightful experience.",1209945600,7,1615,4.985130111524164
1386786,3,B000050X30,"With a list of singers that includes Pavarotti, Milnes, and Marton, you'd expect a ""production of the century.""

Pavarotti's voice is in its prime--it will dazzle you with its richness.  The costumes are as lavish and appropriate as Pavarotti's superb voice.

Despite negative remarks by some reviewers, Sherrill Milnes puts forth a fine singing performance with even better acting and tremendous stage presence.

Yes, we all know that we are supposed to exercise our ""suspension of disbelief,"" but Eva Marton is simply too large and old to portray the young Leonora that these gentlemen are fighting over.  Dolora Zajick is scary and witchlike, which is exactly right for the gypsy woman.

So, why isn't this the dvd performance of the century?

One:  The stage is constantly too dark.  Really, it's hard to tell when there has been a change of the set, as it's simply too dark to tell the difference.

Two:  Leonora is miscast with Eva Maron.  Not criticising Eva--she's very good in other roles she has sung.  She's just not right for Leonora.

Three:  Too many cuts have been made, making it harder to follow the storyline because of minor but abrupt gaps in the action.

It's still an enjoyable production, but it could easily have been much better.",1144627200,15,1254,4.872037914691943
1386787,4,B000050X30,"I just love this video.  I often play it as an audio recording.  Pavarotti is great nothwithstanding his acting abilities.  His singing is the tops.  Marton has a big pretty voice of course, but she is a bit miscast here, as she just doesn't quite have the agility for Leonora.  I would still call her performance quite acceptable.  Zajick is great.  Her singing and acting are absolutely riveting.  Milnes is great - the voice seems to have started it's downturn at this point - a bit of struggling in the passagio, but it's not too noticeable.  He still produces some absolutely gorgeoues tones - a beautiful and touching voice, in my opinion.",1098144000,12,645,4.6875

I actually went to a live performance of this work many years ago and did not particularly like it at the time.  This production (DVD) was easier to live through (in the comfort of my living room), but gave me no reason to change my original opinion of  what I consider Verdi's ""not so great' effort.
