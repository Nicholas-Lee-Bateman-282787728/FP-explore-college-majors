8711128,2,B00VSHDRS6,"This is the only Staff Combat Training video I've seen so far, and I am not well pleased. Maybe I'm being too picky but there are several things that annoy me about this video and them with all of it combined its just terrible, to me.

Cons: video is fuzzy & unclear, poor lighting, only one distant camera - no close up shots, the sound is all off time with instructors lips. instructor has a speech impediment, none of the tactics are ever shown at full speed, the executions are not done in a sharp & convincing way....its more of just slowly going through the motions.
The instructor is old and I'm sure he knows his stuff. He tries to be professional, and isn't bad except for that speech impediment that I just can't shake off. I hate it. Sorry.
I'm gonna buy another training DVD from my local Martial Arts Supply Shop. This one is going to Craigslist",1440201600,,858,4.39622641509434
