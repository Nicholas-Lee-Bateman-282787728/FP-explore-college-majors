8180479,5,B000G1R498,"As I write this, we are seeing a renaissance of interest in real, old-school heavy metal in all its forms. A new group of youngsters that were taught that music began with Nirvana and have been inundated with years of musical pap are doing a little archaeology. They are finding that before 1991 there was a music called HEAVY METAL that blows Fred Durst all the nu-metal/screamo/this-and-that-core groups away, and they are rightly leaving the latter crap on the side of the road where it belongs. But in Germany, metal never died, nor was it diluted with all the fat, sloppy Taco Bell boys and their Loudness War distortion. The proof lies right here in this two-DVD document of the Bang Your Head Festival in Balingen, Germany, which is one of the largest and most famous German metal festivals.

The list of groups represented on this DVD are a true WHO'S WHO of metal and an amazing one-stop introduction to the genre. If you want to get past the obvious names like Ozzy and Metallica, this DVD will allow you to start digging. A bunch of metal subgenres are represented--you have NWOBHM (Saxon), thrash (Death Angel, Overkill), doom metal (Candlemass), extreme metal (Six Feet Under), 70's metal (Uriah Heep), power metal (Brainstorm), and even pop metal (White Lion, Sebastian Bach) represented. The names represent a lot of the classics and the best of the genre, and the performances are high-quality, one-of-a-kind performances.

Here's a full list of what's on this set:

The two-DVD set contains a twenty-page booklet that's loaded with photos and info on the bands. The DVD also features a compilation of footage from each year ofthe festival represented here with commentary from the promoters of the show (in German with no subtitles--sorry), and a gallery of still photos from each year. The total time for JUST THE PERFORMANCES is 160 minutes (2 hours, 40 minutes!), and the extras add another ninety minutes to that.

I think everyone will have different highlights and likes and dislikes on this amazing DVD set. The highlight for me (and the reason I bought it) was the performance by B-TCH. ""Live For The Whip"" is featured on the landmark Metal Massacre, Vol. 1 (1982) compilation which gave the world Metallica. This version features a new spoken-word interlude that is really well written. This also happens to be the band's first performance in Europe and their final performance with founding guitar player David Carruth. B-TCH frontwoman Betsy B-tch looks absolutely fabulous in this appearance too (she was working out 90 minutes every day that the time if that tells you anything).

Some of the other performances I really liked were as follows:

German power-metal band BRAINSTORM do a ridiculously overpowering song called ""Shiva's Tears"" from their 2003 album Soul Temptation; I loved the song so much that I bought the limited-edition German import version of the album, which has a live DVD added as an extra.

I ended up listening to UDO's ""Man and Machine"" over and over. UDO's lead singer Udo Dirkschneider was formerly in the group Accept, who are best known for the incredibly influential speed metal track ""Fast As A Shark"". The song ""Man and Machine"" is incredibly catchy, even though Udo looks like a 60-year-old Jason Alexander (George Castanza in ""Seifeld""), moves like he's in a body cast, and sings like Gonzo of the Muppets. Strange, but it works.

KROKUS are the German AC/DC more or less, and have a Bon Scott sound-alike for a singer. Their song ""Long Stick Goes Boom"" is included here; great tune any AD/DC fan will love even though the name of the song sounds a little funny.

DORO joins Betsy [...] and Ann Boleyn of Hellion as one of the pioneers of ladies in metal. Doro was the lead singer of a German group called Warlock, and their anthem ""All We Are"" is included here. Doro is a really hot blonde and incredibly lovable; she just adores the crowd while she sings her old band's most famous song.

The TWISTED SISTER song ""The Price"" is my favorite track from their classic Stay Hungry album. The best part of this performance is guitarist Jay Jay French's little opening spiel: ""People wonder why bands like Dio and Motrhead and us and Saxon and come back and play places like this... It's because eighties bands are not DEPRESSED like all these new bands! [...] If you're THAT depressed, go to a psychiatrist and DON'T POLLUTE THE AIRWAVES, alright? The EIGHTIES were about PARTYING, that's what makes it so much fun."" Amen, preach it brother! :D

There's so much more too; I haven't even touched on the unique MOTRHEAD, SAXON, and DIO performances and the other DEE SNIDER/TWISTED SISTER performances, or the HIRAX or Y&T stuff. I can tell you that if you love REAL METAL, this 2-DVD set will get tons of play and deliver hours and hours of good times. I cannot recommend it more.",1259020800,,5796,4.731876861966236
