8319846,5,B001LUH0FG,"This video was great! I got to learn about some things off the beaten path, especially some of the Iron Age and Neolithic sites. I actually ended up going to some of those when I went to Wales. This is a great introduction to Wales for a tourist going there for the first time! I found the DVD both informative and practical.",1398470400,3,325,4.258064516129032
8319847,1,B001LUH0FG,"I'm Welsh and I found this item Inaccurate, superficial, clich&eacute;d - I wouldn't want it seen by anyone who might be ill-informed enough to think it acceptable.",1380672000,6,164,5.111111111111111
8319848,5,B001LUH0FG,"This DVD is a must-see if you have interest in any aspect of Wales. I've been studying the language for several years, have been to Wales and am very involved a local Welsh group.  Yet I still found many things of interest and learned more about the history and culture of this beautiful country.

The photography is beautiful and listening to Welshman narrate brings alive the subject matter. But it is the overview of  the different periods of history that make this worth watching. Robert Jones' presentation  of the subject is easy to follow and the visits to relevant sites help cement the information.

I watched this DVD with some non-Welshophiles and they found it just as enjoyable as I did.",1231632000,25,700,4.75206611570248
