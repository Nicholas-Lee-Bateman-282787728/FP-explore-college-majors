I will be ordering this book to give it a read.  If you like this type of information, I also strongly recommend ""Without Conscience"" by Robert D. Hare.",1248220800,2,299,4.518518518518518

3490002,4,B001BEK8CO,"I agree with all that ""Most Evil"" is a well done and fascinating study in the Psychology of the criminal mind of murderers. However, I do take issue with Dr. Stone's 1 to 22 rating system.

For example, his ""15"" rating of Charles Manson baffles me.  Because he never actually physically murdered anyone in the Tate-LaBianca murders he is dropped seven points down on the scale?

By Dr. Stone's definition, Adolph Hitler would also only rate a 15.  That criteria is, of course, rediculous, and the orchestrator and main proponent of the mass genocide of over six million people by virtue of their religious beliefs is considered one of MOST EVIL HUMAN BEINGS in the history of mankind.  I dare Dr. Stone to use his same standards and publically rate Hitler in this manner.  He would be laughed out of his profession, as well as rediculed by the masses for the rest of his career.

I do agree that sadists and sociopaths who derive pleasure from torturing their fellow human beings are the ""most evil"", but those who order these same kinds of crimes share equally in that abhorent behaviour and evil intent.

The one thing that is fascinating about this series is Dr Stone's interviews with some of these most evil perpetrators.  It would have been hugely beneficial to clinical psychologists to have also available FBI Profiler John Douglas's jail interviews with Richard Kempler, the Son of Sam's David Berkowitz, Richard Speck, and the many others he performed in the late 70's and early 80's.  Why these felons commit these heinous acts is truly the most thought provoking contribution to society at large.",1235865600,8,1608,4.835766423357664
3490003,5,B001BEK8CO,"The series is informative and educational for my studies, i especially enjoy viewing them without commercial interruptions. So far as I know they are completely intact episodes without time edits or censoring. I look forward to the next series.",1232409600,,244,5.282051282051282
3490004,5,B001BEK8CO,"Rather than just show who these killers are and what they did (many of whom we already know about) Dr. Stone actually created a scale from 1 thru 21 and grades each killer according to their crimes and mental attitude. Its this take that makes the show different. The higher the score the more ""evil"" the  subject. As your watching your guessing who is ""Most Evil"". Who do you think scored highest? Dahmer? Bundy? Gines?",1223596800,19,420,4.6
3490005,5,B001BEK8CO,"this is the best dvd for people interested in the study of forensic psychology, criminal justice, law enforcement, etc....Dr. Stone did a excellent job creating the scale...i cant wait for season 3...",1222560000,21,200,5.28125
3490006,5,B001BEK8CO,"This is one of my favorite shows.  I have the tivo set to record it on ID.  I have seen many of the episodes several times. I love the doctor's varied and interesting hat choices.  I'm not sure if I have seen all the episodes, and I am always on the lookout for an episode that I haven't seen before.",1222300800,2,300,3.966666666666667
3490007,5,B001BEK8CO,"This is the best show from the Discovery Channel I never miss it and have actually seen every episode several times.  If you like to learn or just are intrigued about how a serial killer could it, this is a GREAT show.",1221782400,19,218,4.190476190476191

3490021,5,B001BEK8CO,"DVDs worked perfectly, and let me tell you, of all the serial killer shows out there THIS is the best one.  The scientist that created his scale of evil and is featured in every episode is amazing.  But they also include other scientists doing similar work making this very accurate and well, scientific!  The best part is they do interviews of actual famous serial killers (ones that are still alive anyway).  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in serial killers from a scientific/psychological perspective.",1395705600,,524,5.058139534883721
3490022,5,B001BEK8CO,"This program isn't intended to scare you & it's not filled with gruesome imagery. It is an in depth look into how & why serial killers (there are a variety of serial killer 'types') behave like they do. It IS scary in it's own right, just because you're amazed at how little compassion these individuals have. You wonder how, even after being caught, they have absolutely no remorse for their victims or the victims families. I would describe it best as 'chilling' & extremely informative.",1393286400,,489,4.764705882352941
3490023,4,B001BEK8CO,"Don't misinterpret when I say ""helps you understand criminals better"" with ""helps you want to become a successful criminal"". This dvd collection helps to understand the minds of the ""Most Evil"". In other words, why they committed their crimes, if they felt any remorse during or after the crimes and peaks into their childhoods to try to figure out where it all started for them.

If there is one thing we can all learn from this dvd collection, it's how sick, twisted and dark the depth of the human mind can go.",1392854400,,513,4.576086956521739
3490024,1,B001BEK8CO,"I purchased this DVD because I work in mental health, I was so looking forward to watching it but when I put it in my DVD player which by the way is a top of the range player all I got was a message saying not suitable for your region. As you can imagine I was pi--ed. I watched every episode on NG and it was brill. There is no warning on the DVD to say where it can be played so it is advisable to ask or find out whether it is compatible or not",1385251200,,447,3.6666666666666665
3490025,3,B001BEK8CO,"The studies conducted in this documentary are slanted in such a way, that anyone who can't take non constructive criticism is a confirmed narcissist. If you had framed it as, ""You could consider removing the apostrophe, and replacing it with a dash"", you would get widely different results. Any test is inconclusive unless it has been peer reviewed. So the test was already corrupted with confirmation bias from the get go.

One of the big things, is that the study ignores [...] in order to avoid many of the personality issues in relation to giving and receiving criticism. Because the ""blinded sample"" was only done on the ""narc"", and not also used to blind the scientist, the scientist made a slip up by only using critique that was not intended to be constructive and avoid personality issues.

 However this is a good resource, to understand the history of cults.",1384128000,,869,4.818791946308725

3490028,5,B001BEK8CO,"This series is very, very good.  For the price of the discs, you're getting a fairly recent look at some of the worst criminals and killers our society has experienced.  As I teach criminal justice coursework, I have found these discs helpful to accompany some lectures.  In preparing for how I would use some of the footage in my class, my wife became interested in what I was watching and now wants to watch all episodes on this set.  It really is well produced, has lots of factual information, and is presented with an entertaining approach that makes viewing these episodes riveting.  The total runtime of these discs versus he price make this purchase a bargain.",1360368000,3,668,4.724137931034483

3490032,5,B001BEK8CO,"If you are one of those people who like murder, the occult and mayhem then this is the perfect movie for you. It's three separate DVDs that break down the many types of real life horror.

3490033,5,B001BEK8CO,"An amazing series that gives you incredibly interesting insight into the psychology of why people kill.  I would caution you about buying this from Amazon, though.  As of the time of the writing of this review, Amazon seems to have a batch of these where disc #2 is a bad pressing and is un-readable by any device.  (I've had mine replaced twice, and disc #2 is always faulty.)  Hopefully they can get that sorted out.",1331078400,,418,4.533333333333333
3490034,5,B001BEK8CO,"Most Evil is an American forensics television program presented by forensic psychiatrist Michael Stone. On the show, Stone rates murderers on a scale of evil that he has developed. Dr. Stone researched hundreds of killers and their methods and motives to develop his hierarchy of ""evil"". The scale ranges from Category 1, those who kill in self-defense, to the Category 22, serial torturer-murderers. The show features profiles on various murderers, serial killers, mass murderers and psychopaths.

If, like me, Criminology is more than a passion for you then you must add this great DVD to your collection. Most Evil is simply the best show about Serial Killers. I don't usually gives 5 stars for a product ( after all nothing is perfect ), but this show deserves a perfect score, in my opinion one of the most fascinating show ever made.

3490035,5,B001BEK8CO,Most Evil really earns its name.  The mind is a terrible thing to waste.  Kudos to this one.  Scary and insightful for sure.,1318896000,,124,4.304347826086956
3490036,5,B001BEK8CO,"Serial killers and psychpopaths, their crimes and motivations, are things that have been of great interest to many people over decades of time.  To try to understand why a person would or could commit crimes so against the morals of our society can fill many with questions and intrigue.  To enter this world can seem morbid and full of depravity.  But these people are or have been a part of our society and interest in their actions makes sense.  Luckily we have a man such as Dr. Michael Stone.  He has dedicated his career to the study of murderers, psychopaths and serial killers.  To help him to understand these people he has come up with a scale from 1-22, an index of depravity if you will, which decodes a killers mind, method and motive and places them on the scale to help us better understand what made them commit the acts they did.  The scale ranges from level 1 being self defense murderers to level 22 which is held for serial torturers and killers.

Each episode takes a broad subject such as PSYCHOTIC KILLERS, STALKERS, SPREE KILLERS, MURDEROUS WOMEN and VAMPIRES/CANNIBALS.  He then picks various cases in each category and uses neurological, genetic and enviriomental research on these killers to place them on the scale of evil.  The show is very educational and provides great details into the workings of the criminal mind.  Neurologists, psychologists and forensic psychologists provide studies and research that help discover why these people behave the way they do.  Partial reenactments, news footage and many interviews with prisoned killers provide great depth to this already educational series.

We have the infamous killers such as Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer and Ed Gein.  But here we see more of their childhood, how their crimes developed and the scale proves to be quite accurate at placing them at a level that makes understanding their crimes make more sense.  It is very interesting to see how the followers of Charles Manson place much higher on the scale of evil than Manson himself.  Much of the subject matter here is very disturbing but it is handled well and not gratuitously.  This is a series by a very well educated doctor who wants to help us understand more the minds of these truly troubled and often depraved souls.  You will meet many criminals you have not heard of whose crimes may be worse than those that are infamous.  Cult leader Adolfo Constanzo is very disturbing.  But every muinute of this series is extremely well researched and uses every resource available to best educate on the subject.  I found out much more on infamous killer Betty Broderick than I had ever know before.  So if you are interested in serial killers and psychotic murders and what made them act as they did this is the place to go to have your questions answered as best as possible.  This dvd set comes highly recommended.  Finally a resource into a troubling subject matter that provides some answers to troubling questions.",1286582400,8,2979,4.818897637795276

8282852,4,B001BEK8CO,"very good explanations of the crimes of serious offenders. dr. stone speaks of what is known of their childhoods and any mental illness. he has spoken separately of the combination of genetics, childhood and personality disorders or mental illness in producing violent offenders.

my only complaint is that I have read a lot about some of these cases/killers, and the narration may have a couple of minor details wrong.

otherwise, I loved this tv cable show and wish it was still on. it's a great dvd if you like true crime and forensic psychology.

lots of photos, video clips of killers and others involved. dr. stone even interviews a few, including tommy lyn sells, one of the most evil serial killers in American history.",1442188800,,727,4.846774193548387
