4334060,5,B004DOTKDM,THESE MOVIES ARE SO MUCH FUN TO SIT AND WATCH BECAUSE YOU CAN SIT AND WATCH THEM WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...,1300924800,,112,4.136363636363637
4334061,5,B004DOTKDM,"This was well worth the money I paid for, three movies in one entire set! I've always watched the Ernest movies when I was younger and found them quite hilarious, with the exception of Ernest In the Army, which is actually pretty stupid and doesn't make sense to the average Army veteran. But these top three movies are excellent and actually have a pretty good plot to all of them, which are explained in the short version way.

""Ernest Goes to Camp""--Ernest P. Worrell is a clumsy groundskeeper at a summer camp who dreams about one day becoming a counselor at Camp Kikakee, which is an Indian tribal site that teaches the way of the Indian to the local youth. He gets his chance with the ""Second Chance"" boys, several city youth from a juvenile detention center who regard Ernest as nothing but a loser, even though Ernest is actually doing his best to keep them from being thrown out. But a danger to the camp's future arises when some local miners are trying to get the camp due to the valuable contents being located on the exact soil of the camp, and Ernest is the camp's last hope to saving the day!
Hilarious part: Ernest gets injured at least half a dozen times in this movie, in which case the camp boss walks over to observe what happened and then remarks casually, ""At least no one got hurt."" Classic!

""Ernest Scared Stupid""--Worrell is back as another average loser in a loser job, which only the kids seem to like in that local town, which has a local legend from when some inhuman monster was imprisoned in a tree by the townfolk over a hundred years back. You notice the local antisocial witch-like woman who doesn't like people being on her property and how Ernest wants to build a treehouse on GUESS WHAT???--the tree which still holds the local monster! The monster soon gets free on Halloween night and sets out to hatch the eggs of more monsters and to turn kids into wooden, mini statues. The monster soon goes on the rampage and nothing can stop him, except...perhaps dairy substances! Guess that the monster is lactose intolerant! Hee hee.
Hilarious part: The main monster cannot be defeated by the dairy products, and is only destroyed when Ernest dances with him and plucks a sloppy kiss on the monster's face. Ewwwwwwww-www! But that scene is guaranteed to have everyone laughing.

""Ernest Goes to Jail""--Worrell is the regular clumsy oaf who is now in charge of being the night janitor at a bank, hoping to be a bank teller someday. His antics only get him into further trouble, but he looks on the bright side to being called up to jury duty at the local jailhouse. Turns out, there is an inmate on Death Row who looks just like Ernest, and manages to make the switch when the jury comes by for a tour. So now the bad inmate is on the loose, hoping to rob the bank that Ernest works at, and Ernest is now on death row, hoping to pass himself off as the tough guy that his character is. But his execution date is coming fast and he must find a way to escape and set things right.
Hilarious part: When Ernest is switched places with the bad guy inmate, he goes about life as usual, and it takes him several hours before he finally realizes that he is in fact...IN JAIL!!! Why? Because of his incoherent belief that the jury members also share lunch with the inmates in the mess hall, and it takes a door of metal bars to be slammed in his face before the realization hits him. Don't we all know a few people as dumb as him? LOL.",1299715200,3,3457,4.440944881889764
4334062,5,B004DOTKDM,"I have to admit, for me at least, Ernest P. Worrell was an acquired taste.  It took awhile for the charm of the character to finally get through to me.  Probably the first Ernest appearance to really tip the scales for me was in Ernest Saves Christmas (not included in this triple pack, but readily available on a single disc DVD) which I saw in the theater, many years ago.  I'm a sucker for Christmas movies anyway, and ESC just hit all the right buttons for me.

Over the years, the genius that was Jim Varney slowly grew on me, catching the occasional Ernest movie that would turn up on cable TV.  I often entertained the notion of collecting the Ernest films on DVD, as they had come to be true guilty pleasures for me.  But other than the aforementioned Ernest Saves Christmas, I somehow never got around to it.  Then along comes this Mill Creek Entertainment Ernest triple feature for well under ten dollars.  What a deal!  The perfect way to kick-start my Ernest DVD collection.  I'm no expert, but so far as I can tell, the image quality of these DVDs is excellent.  Not much in the way of extras, but for the money, how can you go wrong?  Over time, Mill Creek has more or less built their name by releasing any number of public domain films in multi-pack DVD collections of wildly varying quality.  But the one constant has always been a great value for your hard-earned dollar.  Now with the Ernest movies, the Ernest TV series (which I have yet to purchase, but probably will), and several other recent top-quality DVD releases, Mill Creek has greatly enhanced its reputation, at least in my opinion.  Again, thank you, Mill Creek Entertaiment.  And THANK YOU, Jim Varney, may you rest in peace...

So, if you are a fan of Jim Varney/Ernest, this value simply cannot be beat.  Three TOP Ernest films in one low-priced package.  True bang for your buck.  Now go over and check out the terrific value on Mill Creek's Hey Vern, It's Ernest! TV series.  I know I will!",1295913600,12,1977,4.512676056338028
4334063,5,B004DOTKDM,"I've been a fan of Ernest my whole life.  The commercials are great, the series was excellent and I really like the first four movies.  After 'Ernest Scared Stupid' Jim made five more Ernest movies but the first four(the three on this set and 'Ernest saves Christmas')are what I personally think are the best!  So, In my opinion, this set gives you three of the four BEST Ernest movies!

 I own the dvd releases from 2002 of the three movies in this 2011 set.  The first thing I noticed was that 'Jail' and 'Scared Stupid' are in anamorphic widescreen 16x9.  Which I was happy to see because the 2002 dvds of those two films are in fullscreen.  Well, I compared the two and it seems that the widescreen is actually the fullscreen cropped to fit the 16x9 ratio.  I noticed that in 'Jail' when they show an exterior of Ernest's house you can not see the sidewalk in the widescreen version but can in the fullscreen.  It's too bad that they could not get the theatrical print* but it doesn't hurt my enjoyment of the films.  With most televisions widescreen I understand why they did it.  Some customers will not like this fact, I'm sure.

 There are two dvds, one has 'Camp' and 'Jail' on it and the other has 'Scared Stupid'.  The discs are in black paper sleeves and are held within a tray inside the package.  This works well enough, the discs seem decently protected.

 I think 'Camp' on this set is very similar to the 2002 version if not exactly the same, which was released in widescreen (Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1) from Buena Vista Home Entertainment.  As for the other two films, it seems that the picture has been cleaned up.  It seems a bit crisper to me.  I can't say for sure that it is, but I like the quality better with 'Jail' and 'Stupid' on the 2011 releases.

 A fun addition Mill Creek Entertainment made with these are the dvd menus.  The 2002 versions had a simple picture of Ernest and a Play or Scenes option, and while the new 2011 has the same options the menus are clips of the movie you want to watch ('Camp' and 'Jail' sharing a menu alternating clips between the two) and play music from them while you wait to hit play.  A fun idea and well executed.

 Keep in mind I'm a big Ernest fan and that's why I gave this five stars!  Sure there are no special features and there is the widescreen issue I mentioned, plus it's missing the fourth Touchstone film 'Ernest Saves Christmas' (although I'd guess that has something to do with Buena Vista), but for all the fun and humor in these three movies and the price you'll pay- it's a great set!
 If you have the previous releases it's really nothing new, but I'm happy to add the box to my shelf.  I think if you're an Ernest fan and have not been able to get these films, this is a great purchase.  Plus you can't beat the price, knowhutimean?

* EDIT: Marlowe7 added a comment with some great information that I was unaware of: These widescreen versions most likely are the theatrical versions. The full screen versions were just open matte. A lot of movies were filmed this way before widescreen TVs became commonplace. The extra space at the top and bottom of the screen in full screen really adds nothing, but was necessary in the VHS, square TV days.
-----Thanks to Marlowe7 for this information.  There are examples of movies that used this in Marlowe7's full comment that you can read by clicking on the 'comments' below.",1295308800,32,3397,4.462662337662338
4334064,5,B004DOTKDM,"I won't bore anyone with an actual review of the films. We all know Ernest is awesome, and these are 3 of the best Ernest films. I was pleasantly surprised with the video quality. They looked very nice played on my upscaling dvd player, and best of all, they are all anamorphic. A must buy for Ernest fans, especially for the price.",1295308800,20,332,4.370967741935484
4334065,4,B004DOTKDM,"For the most part, this is a great way to own three of the best Ernest movies.  The picture and sound quality of Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Jail are pretty good for standard definition DVD.  Image on these features are crisp and clear with little print damage.  Unfortunately, Ernest Goes to Camp is a disappointment; there's a lot of interlacing issues, lots of combs in the image and the picture looks fuzzy.  That's the only thing stopping me from giving this release the full five stars.  In short, it's a great way to own Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Jail, but you'd probably want to seek out the single-disc copy of Ernest Goes to Camp.",1499385600,,666,4.516666666666667

I suggest watching it first and determining whether you want to do away with that one before the kiddos watch it. I didn't.

4334218,5,B004DOTKDM,"I don't care what anybody says, you just can't match the genius that is the early Ernest movies.  It was quirky, silly, but didn't treat kids like they were too dumb like so many adolescent comedies do these days.

4334227,4,B004DOTKDM,I purchased this for a gift the person who received this dvd said it worked and loved that all three movies came on one disc,1389139200,,124,4.0

4334231,3,B004DOTKDM,Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail are mostly family friendly except for some cussing. Ernest Scared stupid has blatant witchcraft and demonic activity in it which was very shocking for an Ernest movie. Definitely would not recommend Ernest Scared Stupid.,1387670400,2,264,5.162790697674419

4334233,1,B004DOTKDM,Unfortunately I have a double digit IQ so could not digest two DVDs as Ernest Goes to Camp was enough mental abuse.  I believe threat of making your child watch this would be enough to qualify one as being an unfit parent.,1386201600,,222,4.285714285714286

I tolerated them because, of course, they were strictly made for kids...although I did find myself laughing at some of the goofy stuff he did.

We own all of the Ernest movies and these are some of the best.  Its silly clean family/kid humor. Lots of the same jokes over and over. Ernest is a goofy guy with a big heart and not a lot of childish brains who finds himself in strange situations and has to find his way out.  If you liked any of his movies, TV show, or commercials, give this set a try.

4334272,5,B004DOTKDM,"I grew up watching all three of these movies as a kid and now I am 23 years old and still enjoy them from time to time. I am not going to review each film individually since most of you have probably seen these films before, but I do have something to say about how the films themselves are presented and the quality of them. This is a two disc set with 3 films in total, Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail are on the first disc and Ernest Scared Stupid is on the second disc. Sadly, there are no special features or 5.0 Dolby Digital but I do have to say that for being a DVD the quality of the films is quite excellent. I watch them thru my Blu Ray player so the quality is upgraded somewhat so that it probably a plus if you do have a Blu Ray player. On the main menu there a buttons to play the movie and a scene selection menu as well, but that's it. Overall if you are a fan of Ernest and Jim Varney this is a steal especially for the price. Highly recommended.",1357084800,,976,3.9343434343434343

4334287,5,B004DOTKDM,We love Ernest and were so glad to get all three movies in one. Ernest goes to Camp has always been one of our favorites.,1350086400,,121,3.88
4334288,4,B004DOTKDM,"I remember when my mother was babysitting a grandchild once and they had rented a Jim Varney movie. It was probably Scared Stupid but I haven't watched that movie yet. I have watched Goes to Jail and Goes to Camp. Goes to Jail is a lot better than the camp movie. These movies are ok but the acting can at times, by the cast and not Jim, can be simply dreadful. The ""Goes to Camp"" movie featured ex pro football star Lyle Alzado and the ""Goes to Jail"" movie featured ex boxer Randall Tex Cobb in it. The camp movie also had the actual Indian actor Iron Eyes Cody from the 70's pollution tv commercials. The commercial I am talking about is the Indian in the canoe who has a tear in his eye because of the way we are polluting the world. I was glad to see him alive and in a movie. But what a sad movie it is. The acting is at the level of the worst B movie. And it was sad to see that actor in the movie. Jim Varney was one FUNNY guy and I love how he uses his voice and his face. His self monologues are great. As for the movies though they are at best for very young children, say Kindergarden to about second grade. The movies' plots can be very weak. I'm not surprised that only FANS commented on these videos because only a Jim Varney fan would enjoy these pathetic scripts. Jim Varney is a lot of fun but the movies can be quite retarded. The acting of the so called actors can also be simply awful. There is no comedic or dramatic tension. The movies are easy to SLEEP to. The movies are fun though just to watch Jim Varney. Rest in Peace Jim.

Update, I finally watched ""Ernest: Scared Stupid"" and it is by far the best of the three movies. Famous Black Actress Eartha Kitt as some old woman living in some old house on the property where a tree was planted over a troll that would come back to capture kids. The troll also cursed the Varney character's family so that each male descendant would get progressively dumber. This movie clearly has the highest production values and probably the biggest budget. So due to my including this movie in my review if the three pack of movies I felt it was only fair that I add one more star to this review.

Jim Varney might not have risen to the level of a Jerry Lewis but it might have been simply due to the movie company and the movie budgets. Back in the day when I was young Jerry Lewis and even a guy like Don Knotts could be featured in a comedy to appeal to young people and to families. Whatever the case I suppose Jim Varney remained a B movie star even when he was in his best movies. It's impossible for me to know if we saw the best of Jim Varney or if his fame could have been increased with better management. Either way Jim Varney will be remembered by his fans in a positive light. So what if the movies were not so great, Jim Varney was the reason for the movie and he was a funny guy. This world needs more people who help the world to laugh.",1348704000,3,2911,4.114235500878735
4334289,4,B004DOTKDM,"Ernest was a great comedy in years ago but still has the chrisma that holds your attention as in the top ten. The thrills and spills in all his shows will always shine now and in the future. They are amusing entertaining as well as charming. The stories are funny with a bit of difference, exciting and witty. A marvellous family show to share with all. It is a must see movie with plenty of laughs so get the popcorn out and sit awhile for some wonderful entertainment.
