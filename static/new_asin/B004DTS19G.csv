8425996,1,B004DTS19G,"This is a DVD that is produced by Amazon when ordered. Why on earth does it cost $30 for 5 episodes?  We love Mr. Rogers, we enjoy the show.

It is free on Amazon Prime, or $1.99 per episode, or you can purchase the entire season for less than $18, but that is an online version only through Amazon viewing (which is not always up to par). A DVD costs next to nothing to produce; the package likely a few dollars. But Amazon has set a high price because this can't be purchased anywhere else. That is sad. I wanted to purchase this as a gift; I wanted to have it so when we travel, it is available. However, at these greedy prices by Amazon, I won't be purchasing them. And I don't recommend them.

Believe me, I hate to give a Mr. R. product a low rating. This rating is not for the episodes, but for this product. I give this version, sold at this ridiculous price, a one star.
