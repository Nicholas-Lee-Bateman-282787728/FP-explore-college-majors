7991475,2,B00009L540,"This little nightmare of a film is the brainchild of Matt Walsh, who claims it is a romantic social commentary, although no matter how you slice it is just another splatter movie. The film follows Tempe regulars Ariauna Albright and James L. Edwards around Ohio on a killing spree. Ariauna wants to kill, and Edwards goes along with her insanity just to get a date. I gave it two stars: one for each of the interesting plot twists, both of which are fully confirmed near the end of the film (if you make it that far).

Despite the highbrow claims in the commentary track, this really is just a gorefest, with special bonuses like victims painted like clowns (with no explanation given), and a baby gunned down by a priest and a nun (a scene that tastefully cues Edwards to suck on a pacifier and causes Albright to dance spastically.) There are a few amusing lines (""You know, for a serial killer you sure are a drag sometimes."") and some decent acting (Randy Rupp excels as Rupert), but there are also endless, exposition-filled scenes in various basements featuring contrived, poorly delivered dialogue. The special effects are likewise terrible: the ""this little piggy"" scene and scene where Joe Daw gives Albright acid are especially amateurish looking. Speaking of Daw, he does a decent job in his role but is clearly uncomfortable with the part he was cast in. I was unsurprised to hear in the commentary that he did this only after being repeatedly begged to do it by Walsh: Daw's prognostications were certainly on target.

The film also gets kudos for a good commentary track. Among other things gleaned from the commentary is the fact that Edwards and Albright do not like each other, and Edwards' claim that this is his favorite movie he has been in, which is kind of sad. The film was based on a short feature called ""I've Killed Before"" also starring Albright and Edwards, which was thoughtfully included in the extras. It is interesting to compare the two, and the thoughts of short producer Ron Bonk are interesting to compare to the feature commentary with Walsh, Albright, and Edwards. Equally enlightening as the commentary is the ""making of"" feature. I found it interesting that everyone involved with the project was unhappy and considered it miserable to work on: this goes a long way toward explaining the end result. I also found it revealing that Tempe mogul J. R. Bookwalter (who I think is very talented) hated the short version, yet still allowed Walsh and company to make the feature.

Overall and despite the contentions of Walsh (who claims this is high-minded social commentary) and the actors (who claim this is merely a love story) this is just a feast of largely pointless gore, although I believe that the insane romance angle has more validity than the social commentary angle, especially in light of Walsh's contentions at the very end of the film. Amateurish, brutalizing, and frequently boring, I can't recommend the film to anyone other than a dyed in the wool gorehound.",1217635200,2,3011,4.820116054158607
7991476,5,B00009L540,"Bloodletting is one of the better low budget horror flicks to come out in the 90's. The main characters are Butch and Serena. The basic plot involves a demented tale of murder and mayhem with many twists and shocks. The Amazon Editorial Review states the plot rather clearly, so it's almost moot for me to extend upon it much.
Bloodletting was not an easy film to make. It's shooting time was only 3 or 4 days with a very meager budget. There was high tension on the set throughout filming and several friendships were tarnished for years. It's amazing that the final cut turned out to be a decent little movie.
This new DVD is packed with many bonus features. I was lucky to get it from Tempe a couple of months ahead of the release date. Although the picture and sound are nothing to rave about, it looks as good as it will ever look on DVD, especially considering it wasn't shot on 35mm film. It is presented in Full Frame, which is it's original aspect ratio. The new sound remix is leagues better than the old vhs edition. Now for the actual special features:
It includes the short film ""I've Killed Before"" which was shot before Bloodletting and also starred Ariauna Albright & James L. Edwards. This is basically a shortened version of Bloodletting with some minor differences in the story and names. Shot on video, it had a poor production that made the final product suffer...however it is still entertaining, if only to compare with the later Bloodletting.
A new and interesting ""Making Of"" feature sheds some light on the problems that plagued the production. Some deleted scenes are also worth it to buy this DVD. Trailers for Bloodletting and many other Tempe movies are also included. A still gallery is also very nice, with production photos and artwork of the various old vhs editions. A large section of Text Reviews from various sources are also included.
The DVD does include an inner insert with notes from Tempe's J.R. Bookwalter. Perhaps the nicest feature is the DVD-ROM feature. If you place this in the DVD drive on your computer you can access the FULL SOUNDTRACK for Bloodletting (previously for sale on CD) in high-quality MP3 format!
Not everyone will enjoy Bloodletting as much as some. Several scenes could be quite offensive to certain people. But, if you're a fan of low-budget horror then you really need to check it out......",1058659200,8,2360,4.716707021791768
7991477,5,B00009L540,"A splatter tragicomedy from writer-director Matthew Jason Walsh, ""Bloodletting"" focuses on a young woman named Serena (Ariauna Albright) who blackmails notorious serial killer Butch Harlow (James L. Edwards) into teaching her the craft of murder. They fall in love and go on a killing spree. Naturally, the young lovers eventually run into relationship problems, as Serena's ever-increasing bloodlust becomes too much for Butch to handle. Edwards and Albright play off each other beautifully, delivering passionate performances while sending up modern relationships and serial killing with giddy aplomb. The dialogue scenes between them amidst all the carnage are killer. Just wait till Serena, in the heat of a lovers' spat, cries, ""This is not about killing people anymore, Butch. This is about us!"" The showstopper, of course, is a wee little baby being splattered all over a wall due to an accidental shotgun blast. Yes, it sounds sick. And it is. But in the context of this delightfully twisted film, the exploding baby is as sly and funny as anything in ""American Psycho."" Sure, ""Bloodletting"" may be a bit rough around the edges, but its near-brilliant writing and the memorable, inspired performances by Edwards and Albright eclipse most if its micro-budget shortcomings. If you ask me, ""Bloodletting"" is the best serial-killer love story of all time.",1055030400,10,1359,5.325581395348837
