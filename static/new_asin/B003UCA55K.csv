4194871,5,B003UCA55K,"This movie is one that every Christian should own.  The story is one that we all can relate to in terms of dealing with pain and suffering in our lives.  It is hard to believe how well done this production is for the limited budget, but it delivers, and delivers in a powerful way.  The music score goes well with the movie and it really helps you feel the emotions involved in the story.  It shows that no matter what we go through in this life, God will never leave us and is always there, even if we falter.  I'll recommend this movie as an excellent choice.  Thanks to Praise Pictures and I look forward to the next movie.",1282867200,,626,4.218487394957983
4194872,5,B003UCA55K,Standing Firm is about a man that loses his wife in an accident all the while he struggles with faith in god. His journey back and everything that happens is so real and the movie is just amazing. It best selling point is it is so real. I could see myself in that position years ago with the anger but the journey is so awesome that you will be very fulfilled with this movie.,1282694400,14,376,4.094594594594595
4194873,5,B003UCA55K,"Standing Firm is a strong and clear picture of how someone shouldn't waver in their faith.  The Bible says that if you deny Christ before men, He will deny you before the Father.  Standing firm in your faith is a cornerstone of being Christian and this movie stresses this and shows you how it's done.  The storyline is great, the cinematography is up there with movies that cost a hundred times more to make.  This is Kyle Prohaska's first movie but shouldn't be his last.  I've got 4 movies at the front of my collection -- ""Flywheel"", ""Facing the Giants"", ""Fireproof"" and now ""Standing Firm"". A great movie for your collection and as a gift.",1282521600,110,644,4.565217391304348
4194874,5,B003UCA55K,"On a technical level, for this having been the writer/producer/director's first film, this is well done. And the story is very true (coming from real experience). I could be biased since I happen to believe in the Christ this story is pointing you towards, but, the challenge for meaning in pain and suffering is for anyone to answer. Will that answer be found in you or outside of you? Check out this film for an answer I believe gives hope. ""To God be the Glory"". :-)",1282435200,12,469,4.465116279069767
4194875,5,B003UCA55K,"I watched Standing Firm and found it to have two components often lacking in Christian Films; namely authenticity and believable characters and dialogue. I feel like the people in the film could have been people I know. When a key character comes to Christ, it's so classic to see him beating himself up because he couldn't lead his co-worker to Christ on his first day back to work since putting his faith in Jesus. I've seen new believers with that sense of ""What I'm experiencing is real, why can't I just share it""? and the passion to do so.

I pray that this film does great on DVD because it speaks to our times, dealing directly with God's providence and sovereignty in the flattening of the housing bubble and the economic crisis. I highly recommend this film.",1282435200,4,768,4.605839416058394
4194876,5,B003UCA55K,Standing Firm is a realistic portrayal of the struggles and pains that we go through as Christians. You faith will be strengthened and uplifted through the story of this film.,1282348800,58,175,4.866666666666666

4194935,4,B003UCA55K,"Standing Firm is a complex, honest, and realistic film. Many Christian films end with the person getting saved and everything getting better. In this movie, as in real life, it doesn't. The central theme of this movie is suffering, so Standing Firm is infused with a melancholic tone throughout. The pacing is slow, so if you aren't a patient soul, don't bother watching. But you will be challenged to really think about your faith as you watch this movie.",1395100800,,456,4.784810126582278

  A good movie touches you,  makes you think and provokes you to change.  I have some things I need healing from and for God to use this movie to reveal that need...there IS something powerful and quite unexpected in that.

This film would be better if it didn't spend so much time on this point.  The acting and production quality are fairly good.  Once the film finally picks up, it's not halfway bad at all--but it drags terribly until that point.

Evidence, that even though things may not turn out exactly as we had hoped and dreamed, God turns tragedy into triumph as long as we trust Him to do the leading.

It provides a clear picture of the grief process and the way it touches all areas of our lives, yet, through the strength of the Lord we are overcomers!",1328659200,,455,4.066666666666666

4194984,5,B003UCA55K,"While ""Standing Firm"" is not an Oscar winning film by any means, it is not a failure either. Made on a low budget by a first time filmmaker, this film has a quality that is quite surprising. I have seen many Christian films, and ""Standing Firm"" competes with those that are made on a larger budget by more experienced filmmakers. The film has its problems - the beginning is somewhat slow and the film can get melodramatic without timely reprieve, however the message is powerful and effective. There are uplifting comedic scenes that make you laugh and dramatic heart-felt scenes that make you cry. As far as the gospel is concerned, the film is not afraid to acknowledge Jesus (by name, which many mainstream ""Christian"" films have shied away from) and there is a form of a gospel message presented (although admittedly not clear cut with all points of salvation). It would be advised that if you are watching this film with someone who is unsaved or presenting it to unbelievers you would want to follow up with them on what it means to be saved. You should never let any movie, book, etc. speak for itself without actually discussing with the person about the gospel. Thus stated, this is an effective tool to open up the door for conversations and encourage believers who are in similar situations as the characters in the movie.
I give this film 5 stars, not because it is the most wonderful movie I have ever seen, but because of the power of God to use meager means to produce something that can make His name great wherever it goes. ""God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong."" As Christian movies continue to be made, lets hope they grow with the quality (as compared with budget) and uncompromising integrity of films like ""Standing Firm.""",1300060800,36,1767,4.6485623003194885

4194987,3,B003UCA55K,"The production quality of this movie isn't anything like ""Faith Like Potatoes"", but the message is very good nonetheless.  I also purchased this movie for a mission trip to Managua, Nicaragua.  We showed it to 25 teenaged girls living at an orphanage one evening.  It was well received and the girls were totally into the movie, clapping at scenes and jubilent at the story's end.  I would recommend this movie as a good Christian story that every one can relate to because we have all tried to witness to people who reject the message and us.",1298678400,3,543,4.625

4194989,5,B003UCA55K,I can't believe this is low budget.  You get so swept away in the storyline that all else fades away.

This movie encouraged me.,1297641600,,290,4.218181818181818
4194990,4,B003UCA55K,"I really enjoyed watching this film and was very impressed by its quality, especially considering that this is the director's first feature.

I'm looking forward to more movies from Kyle in the future.",1295308800,2,380,4.602941176470588
4194991,5,B003UCA55K,"The movie is definitely aimed at a Christian audience, but I think that is what makes it effective. It gets down to the basics of the Christian faith, without smashing the audience over the head with the steps to salvation.

Technically, there are great images from the Canon XH-A1. The audio on the film is quite nice in general, and the scenes that aren't quite up to par, still aren't awful. Some of the acting is a bit stiff, especially some of the one-liners, but there is still plenty of good material, specifically from Rob Reisman, playing Dave.

While Standing Firm doesn't have fast-paced action, and at 83 minutes isn't that long for a feature, it has an encouraging message packed into it, with some humor sprinkled in here and there. Singles, couples, and families alike are sure to be smiling by the end of the film. I know I was.",1295222400,4,844,4.582781456953643
4194992,5,B003UCA55K,"Kyle Prohaska is a young director. Yet he uses a maturity about certain issues in his script, and approaches the topic of a Christian son's relationship with an unbelieving father in a way that seems fresh, unique, and memorable.  After I watched the film, my family watched it together, and a friend of ours made the comment about the characters that, 'It felt like I spent the weekend with them.  There was a genuineness to the relationships that I could connect with.'

It's not a technically excellent film like a modern blockbuster; it actually feels more like you would expect of a first feature film from a young director. A sort of 'made for TV' film.  Single camera, clean environments, few characters; yet the film manages to avoid feeling stale, and avoid being distractingly low budget, as so many other films fail to do.

I encourage you to buy this film.  Not just for the film itself, but knowing who made it.  Watch the behind the scenes, watch the special features.  It's a really, really hard topic to tackle, and Kyle handles it with a maturity beyond what anyone would expect from a nineteen year old writer/director.

If you're expecting Amazing Grace or To Save a Life, you may be confused by the film. But if you know what you're watching; one nineteen year old's four year journey to communicate the gospel through his first film, you'll be touched, you'll be impressed, and the behind the scenes may just move you to tears.  :)",1295222400,4,1452,4.681102362204724
4194993,2,B003UCA55K,"This movie was just okay for me. It did not explain what you really need to do to be forgiven and to forgive. The son in the movie was the best actor of the whole movie. I just do not believe you can become a Christian by asking Jesus to come into your heart and be forgiven. There is more to it according to His word, The Bible. So, I was disappointed in this movie.",1295222400,6,367,3.9066666666666667
4194994,2,B003UCA55K,"An amateur production with a slow storyline made this film hard to finish. Watched it with unsaved family and I was equally disappointed in the lack of clarity in what was supposed to be a Gospel message and absence of scripture. Could have been a powerful tool (as the cover claims) but in the end is a sluggish feel good story about anger, loss, and regret.",1295049600,5,359,4.454545454545454
4194995,2,B003UCA55K,"I bought a bunch of Christian movies recently, but this is one of the slow moving ones. Though it is slow moving, it is believable. It addresses the fact that bad things happen to good people, and that we do go through difficulty in life, but that does not mean that God does not love us nor does it mean that God does not care. It talks about a man who lost his wife, and his journey to knowing the Lord. I personally did not like the abrupt ending.",1291852800,21,450,4.067415730337078

4195003,4,B003UCA55K,"Standing Firm is Writer/Producer/Director Kyle Prohaska's first film. To be honest, I was expecting it to look like someone's first film...not very good. Yet my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the quality throughout the film. The story is grounded in reality; we can all relate to pain, loss and grief. The characters are believable. The cinematography is pretty good given the limited budget. The bottom line is communicated excellently; despite great suffering, we can still have hope because Jesus lived, died and rose from the grave!

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it took me awhile to make an emotional connection with the lead character. It does come but not until later in the film.

You won't be disappointed with this film. Buy it!

As a side note, the future looks very bright for this young filmmaker. He is clearly wise beyond his years and well-grounded in his faith. I look forward to seeing more of his work down the road.",1284422400,7,972,4.773809523809524
