7906316,5,B00000F0PR,"Great video about life aboard an aircraft carrier.  What makes this even more likeable is that the ship they filmed it on, the USS Independence (CV-62), was the ship I spent a good deal of time aboard.  The video is accurate and loaded with facts.",1499212800,,247,4.466666666666667
7906317,1,B00000F0PR,"Of the multiple items I purchased this was the only VHS item. Be that as it may, a product should be in good working order when sold. The video was played only once by my husband, because during rewind, the tape tangled in our machine. I have no problems with other videos we still have and play in our home. I can only assume the product was defective  before it was sold to us.",1294704000,,379,4.121621621621622
