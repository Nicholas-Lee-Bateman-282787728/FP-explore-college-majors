7865306,2,6304234783,"On the 9th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...WCW Hog Wild. The Cruiserweight title match between Rey Mysterio Jr & Ulitmato Dragon was a high-flying,high-tech thrill ride. The Scott Norton-Ice Train match was like Cars 2,a dud. The Battle of the Bikers match between Madusa & Bull Nakano was not great but good. The Chris Beniot-Dean Malenko match was awesome even with the time limit draws. The World Tag Team title match between Harlem Heat & The Steiner Brothers while pretty good,the crowd hated the ending. The United States title match between Ric Flair & Eddie Guerrero was also...The Miz:AAAAAAWWWWWEEESSSSSOOOOMMME! The tag team match between The Outsiders(Kevin Nash & Scott Hall) against the team of Lex Luger & Sting was awful. The Worlds title match between Hollywood Hulk Hogan & The Giant was boring & awful. I give this PPV a 3 out of 10.",1356134400,,864,4.884353741496598
7865307,5,6304234783,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one which was the first ever WCW event coming from the annual Sturgis Biker Riley in Hog Wild (later renamed Road Wild).  This took place around one month after Hulk Hogan was revealed as the third man in the group now known as the New World Order (nWo) with Scott Hall & Kevin Nash and went through a transformation from the red & yellow ""Hulk Hogan"" to the black & white ""Hollywood Hogan.""

WCW Crusierweight Champion Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Ultimate Dragon - As put over by Mike Tenay, both men knew each other so well from their previous encounters all over the world that they were able to avoid & counter each others moves early while also trying to show each other up attempting the others signature moves.  Dragon grounded Rey & tried to work over his legs at one point with moves like the figure four while Rey was able to keep Dragon on his toes including one moment where he gave a baseball slide kick that ended up knocking Dragon off the elevated ringside area to the dirt floor.  They went back & forth with fast paced momentum including Dragon being able to dropkick Mysterio in mid-air in a very good opening match.

Scott Norton vs. Ice Train - Unfortunately the copy I watched for this match was very dirty during this area & I couldn't see the match clearly enough to comment on it.

Madusa vs. Bull Nakano - See above.

Chris Benoit vs. Dean Malenko - Dean Malenko was a ""hitman for hire"" by Jimmy Hart & the Dungeon Of Doom to take out Chris Benoit in order for Jimmy to use his influences to get Malenko title shots to regain the Crusierweight Championship.  Both men started off very intense & aggressive and never let down once.  Both men relied on such high impact moves like Benoit's snap suplexes & Malenko doing a leaping tombstone piledriver along with moves that ended up hurting themselves along with their opponent that caused Dusty Rhodes to make the statement that summarized each man's effort here, ""They've done everything but pin each other!""  Various submissions came into play such as the ""Canadian Crippler Crab"" & Malenko turning his Texas Cloverleaf into an STF.  They fought past the 20 min. time limit into a double overtime period where it took dirty tactics to get a winner but this was definitely a wrestling encounter that can be defined as a ""lost classic.""

WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat vs. Steiner Brothers - Well ""Heat"" was the right name for Booker & Stevie here because the crowd was all over them right from the start. Harlem Heat had their best series of matches in WCW against the Steiner Brothers because they just had that natural chemistry with each other. I'll go as far as to call this a lost classic when it came to tag team wrestling during this period of wrestling. One funny side note was to pay attention to Bobby Heenan's commentary since he kept forgetting that this PPV was on a Saturday, not a Sunday.

WCW United States Champion Ric Flair vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was the foreshadowing of the heel Eddie we would see later in his WCW career as he was able to return the mind games of intimidation that Flair was doing right back to him & took the fight right to Ric throughout the match. Great match that was so close that the ending can be summarized with one line from Dusty Rhodes, ""one mistake cost Eddie Guerrero.""
[Viva La Raza: Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

Sting & Lex Luger vs. The Outsiders - This started out between Luger & Hall with Luger keeping control of Hall early on before Nash got tagged in & called out Sting resulting in them trading punches & Sting slamming Nash.  The Outsiders were able to regain control & constantly worked over Sting while keeping him away from Luger for a majority of the bout.  This was a nice tag team match that played off the ""grudge"" that both men had against each other but the bigger story here was the involvement of referee Nick Patrick that was the determining factor.  As a side note, the commentary here is humorous at time as Heenan was such used to being a heel that he kept accidentally cheering The Outsiders at times.

WCW Champion Giant vs. Hollywood Hogan - Giant was in a dominate position early causing Hogan to keep rolling out of the ring after every move Giant got on him to break the momentum & slow things down.  Hogan was able to finally gain control in his power such as a test of strength & kept the Giant down by working on his arm.  At one point Giant was able to turn the tables on Hogan when he started to ""Hulk Up"" & nailed Hogan with his own big boot before we saw Hall & Nash get involved leading to Hogan capturing the WCW Championship.  However the most historic relevance of his match happened afterwords once we saw Hogan address the nWo's stance of ""business over friendship"" with Booty Man before leaving their mark on the WCW Championship.
[Hulk Hogan: Ultimate Anthology]

Overall this was one of WCW's best cards during this period from top to bottom as evident by WWE later using releasing many of the main matches off this set onto their own DVD sets so I suggest that even if you have most of the matches on DVD, still get this event as it was a standout card in WCW's history.",1306713600,,5334,4.488636363636363
7865308,4,6304234783,"This event was a very good follow-up to the two previous events before it.  Shows the NWO fully together and dominating for the first time in a pay-per-view.

Commentary: Dusty Rhodes, Tony Schiavone, and Bobby Heenan.

- Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. for Cruiserweight Title (4.5/5)
We all expect great things from Mysterio and Ultimo Dragon puts on a great show, with foreign submission moves that will leave your head spinning.

- Ice Train vs. Scott Norton (2/5)
Eh.  No one cared.

- Bull Nakano vs. Madusa (2/5)
A boring match, but you get to see destruction of a motorcycle.

- Dean Malenko vs. Chris Benoit (5/5)
This match was off the charts!  Both men gave it their all in this near 30 minute match.  It was back and forth the whole time.  It was long, but it never got boring.

- The Steiner Brothers vs. Harlem Heat for Tag Team Titles (4.5/5)
Well done!  I loved this tag team match for the wrestlers involved, the energy of the fans, and the Harlem boys who definitely got their heat.

- Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair for U.S. Title (5/5)
Another great match between two legends.  I think both styles, which were very opposite, seemed to go together like bread and butter.  One of Ric Flair's best matches, and Eddie Guerrero shows that he can go toe to toe with anyone.

- Lex Luger & Sting vs. The Outsiders (4/5)
Very exciting tag team match for the fact that the NWO was just formed.  The Outsider are my favorite tag team of all time, so any match with them in it keeps me glued.

- The Giant vs. Hollywood Hogan (3/5)
Not a very good match, but afterwards Hogan cuts a nice promo and beats up an old friend to gain some heat.

This is a must buy.  Especially if your interested in the roots of NWO, and outdoor wrestling events.",1230076800,,1752,4.398753894080997
