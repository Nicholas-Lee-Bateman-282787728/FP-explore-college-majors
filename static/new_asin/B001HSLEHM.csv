8309479,5,B001HSLEHM,"This is an amazing DVD, albeit a bit short. This tells the accurate story of one of the very few great gypsy improvisational guitarist Jimmy Rosenberg. I would reccomend it highly to anyone familiar with Rosenberg. Be careful as it may not play in all players. I have a multi-region player. Great interviews of his family and story of his life. If anyone knows what Rosenberg's current status is please respond to this review. His website hasn't been updated in over a year which sounds like he is back into the heavy drugs...lets hope not! Awesome DVD worthy of repeat watching!! This guy is just great!",1253577600,,604,4.7075471698113205
