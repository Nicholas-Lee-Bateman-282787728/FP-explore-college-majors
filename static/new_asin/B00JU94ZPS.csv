6390251,3,B00JU94ZPS,"As a rule, I mention it when a movie is made for a targeted audience; this one definitely is, and it hits the bullseye! Every 20'ish young man in the audience applauded with each knife thrust, bullet smack, beheading and torture. They laughed out loud at the R-rated vulgarities that flew off the screen and chatted happily as we exited the theater. Needless to say, I am NOT part of that targeted group, so I was less than thrilled.

We begin with an elite DEA undercover team as it raids a drug cartel's safe house. Our heroes do something illegal with $10M before blowing up the rest. When they go back to pick up their stash, it's gone. With the investigation that follows, our story begins....

One by one, our guys are killed in horrific ways (not necessarily in this order):
  * Arnold Schwarzenegger (""The Last Stand"") Breacher is the team leader. While he is under investigation, his team starts to suspect each other.
  * Sam Worthington (""Somersault"") Monster has one weakness: his wife.
  * Terrence Howard (""Prisoners"") Sugar keeps a low profile.
  * Joe Manganiello (""Magic Mike"") Grinder wants to set things straight.
  * Max Martini (""Captain Phillips"") Pyro is my favorite.
  * Mirelle Enos (""Gangster Squad"") Lizzy seems to be a loose cannon.
  * Kevin Vance (""End of Watch"") Tripod has his own safe house.
  * Josh Holloway (""Mission Impossible"") Neck has poor taste in tattoos.
  * Olivia Williams (""Hyde Park on Hudson"") is a homicide detective pulled in waaay over her head!

Writer/Director David Ayer (""Fury"") is far more focused on gruesome action than finesse. That suited his audience just fine. Not me.... If it's you, Amazon is at your service.",1399161600,10,1673,4.820422535211268
6390252,4,B00JU94ZPS,"Breacher (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads a group of DEA special ops who skim . On a big bust, they hide the money, only to discover it is missing when they go back for it. They end up in an internal investigation that gets dismissed. The group gets reinstated, but are now getting picked off one by one. Caroline (Olivia Williams) is an Atlanta City detective investigating the murders of this tight knit ""family"".

This is a ""B"" action/crime film. The whodunit plot I had pretty well figured out by the second kill. Our stars did not dazzle. No lines to take away. Arnold was rather dull and lifeless sitting on his rump, smoking a cigar. The film had some good action scenes, unfortunately the filler scenes didn't quite make it.

Makes for a good action rental. 3 1/2 stars

6390256,3,B00JU94ZPS,"Sabotage, 1936 film

The film begins in London at night. Suddenly the lights go out due to a power failure. Could a simple substance like silicon dioxide sabotage a big city? A blackout in peacetime? Will the patrons of the cinema get their money back? Mr. Verloc seems unconcerned. He is the owner operator of this small business, its not a big corporation. Is the grocer next door too interested in the cinema? Do terrorists stir up trouble at home so people ignore foreign news? Or is that how the news is played. Verloc meets his controller who asks him to leave a ""parcel"" at Piccadilly Circus to terrorize the population. Ted befriends Mrs. Verloc and her son at a restaurant. Verloc is under surveillance, they know who he meets and where he goes. The talk in the movie is meant to be ironic.

Ted notices friends of Verloc going into the cinema. [A great place for surreptitious meetings.] Ted is known to one of the conspirators, the operation is cancelled. [Undercover operatives should never be part of official operations.] Ted returns to question Mrs. Verloc. Verloc sees this and decides to use her son to carry the ""parcel"" along with some movie reels to avoid surveillance. Stevie walks through the London crowds on his destination. A parade through the streets delays him while time marches on. [There is always the unexpected in any plan.] The suspense comes from knowing the people in the film are oblivious to the danger that is around them. There is bad news!

Verloc blames others for his actions. A cartoon serves as an echo on the events. A mistake leads to rough justice, Verloc will not talk about this conspiracy. Ted and Mrs. Verloc have bonded. The police arrive to arrest the bomb maker and Verloc, but do not succeed. The film tries to create a happy ending; it doesn't work. This story about terrorists with bombs is not obsolete today. This film is adapted from Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent"". Was the novel better? Plots by anarchists were a danger from the end of the 19th century. Was there a similar threat in more recent times? Note the very large crowd scenes, you won't see this in later movies.

Perhaps you should know the background of this time (the Great Depression, the growing power of fascist movements) to best appreciate this story. Hitchcock's later films were better (less censorship?). Note his recurring interest in films about people who are not as they seem.",1514937600,,2418,4.75

6390321,4,B00JU94ZPS,"Having been a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger fan for nearly 30 years, I am always excited to see what the legendary actor is up to even today.  His cameo in The Expendables was good fun (although his appearances in the sequels leave a lot to be desired), and his roles in Escape Plan, The Last Stand, and most recently, Terminator Genisys, at least were entertaining.  The movie that gets the most scrutiny though since his full return to acting is Sabotage.  Honestly, that makes absolutely no sense to me, this movie is really quite a treat.

To be clear, this is not necessarily an action film.  It does have action elements, but I would classify this as a thriller/mystery first and foremost.  Schwarzenegger plays Breacher, the leader of an elite DEA squad of dirty cops.  This team is composed of a who's who of recognizable faces:  Sam Worthington (who has always gotten the short end of the stick from critics, but the guy has been the lead in some successful big-budget sci-fi films like Avatar, Terminator Salvation, Clash of the Titans, and Wrath of the Titans; here he is bald and has a tied up goatee beard); Mireille Enos (who is fantastic as a drug riddled and sex obsessed undercover member of the team; you might remember her as the wife in World War Z or the lead in AMC's The Killing); Joe Mangeniello (he's the big dude who looks like a supermodel in Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL; here he's got a graying beard and cornrows); Terrence Howard (the star of Hustle & Flow and Fox's Empire, as well as the original War Machine in Iron Man plays the quietest member of the group); Max Martini (you'll recognize him from Saving Private Ryan, Pacific Rim, and The Unit); and Josh Holloway (Sawyer from Lost).  The strong cast supports Arnold well, with Arnold easily giving one of his best performances on film as the tough-as-nails and infamous leader of the group.  After they steal money from the cartel, they are suspended for months until they are cleared to return when no one can prove their guilt.  Their reputation shot because of that theft, as well as their hard as nails attitudes and roughneck looks, makes them a force to be reckoned with as well as some of film's dirtiest lawmen.  The rest of film follows the group as they are killed in horrific ways and who is behind these attacks.  Investigating them are 2 agents played by Olivia Williams (the other star of the film, who does good work in support of Arnold) and Harold Perrineau (most recognizable still as Michael from Lost, but he's been around in The Matrix Reloaded, 28 Weeks Later, and many others).  They get involved in the web spun by these dirty cops, investigating not just the cartel who has a past in abducting, killing, and sending the body parts of Breacher's family back to him, but the cops themselves, who are all suspicious enough to have done any of the crimes and killings themselves.

The most obvious thing about this movie is that it is excessively violent.  Some reviewers have commented that it almost resembles a slasher film, which is a tad much, but could fit the bill.  I don't mind the violence as it fits with the tone set by the over-the-top characters that the film has introduced us to.  David Ayer is well known for delivering wavering and violent cops or armed forces in past films, from writing Training Day and directing End of Watch, Fury, and Street Kings (as well as handling both duties on the upcoming villain centric comic book film, Suicide Squad).  He does so here as well, giving us loads of blood, guts, and shoot-em-ups to match with Arnold and his corrupt team of police.  Speaking of Arnold again, as I said, he gives one of his better late career performances.  He is different than the usual heroic self, tattooed, grizzled, and somber in his old age and weary of everyone since his family has been killed in such a horrible way.

I suppose my love for this movie comes from the unity of such a hard nosed group of people working together for a cause, despite them being unlikeable a-holes.  The acting and comradely are top notch (in my opinion anyways), and I buy what the film is selling.  They work together like a unit similar to Arnold other great commando unit  movie, Predator, or even Stallone's Expendables.  The investigation leads to some dark scenes and gory deaths.  The film also does contain some good action, something else the film is often criticized for.  Unfortunately, the marketing dictated that this would be an action film, which it really is not.  The team building action is very cool and precise like that of a real SWAT unit, but few and far between with scenes of exposition, investigation, and talking filling the gaps.

The Blu-ray gives plenty more to fill in the gaps, in the form of deleted scenes and alternate endings.  A brief featurette also covers the making-of, mostly praising director Ayer and action star Schwarzenegger for their work on the film.  I cannot see this movie ever hitting cult status, but if it does, it would be nice to get more information on behind-the-scenes.

If you are a fan of Schwarzenegger, and want to see him do something a little different than most of his past films (but still be a badass), then open your mind, try not to read too much of the negativity this film has attached to it, and enjoy the proceedings.",1449446400,4,5319,4.636460554371002

Whats really sad is I've seen some of these other actors in other movies and they weren't this bad. This movie just butchered their chances at lighting up the screen and it is a shame. The only cool thing about this movie is whenever they clear rooms, which is about 11 minutes out of a 1 hour and 50 minute movie. 10% of this movie gets an 8 out of 10, the other 90% bets a 1 out of 10.

This is possibly the best film Arnold has made since his return to film. It is at least the most serious one from what I remember. This turned out to be a very good movie, in fact it was much better than the rep it has. When this movie came out it bombed and watching it now I don't see why. I wish I had gone to see it instead of waiting for the Blu-Ray. It was never boring, had great characters and the action and violence brings me back to that never boring thing. Also I loved the story here as it is about friendship that is tested.

The story follows a team of special ops DEA agents led by Arnold himself. They are really good at what they do but unfortunately they are also crooked cops. During one bust they steal ten million dollars and stash it to come back for it later. Once there though they find out someone has taken the money and they have no idea who. To make matters worse someone is also taking them out one by one, and doubt is cast among them all. Oh and did I mention that they are also being investigated for being crooked cops, just another day on the job.

Writers David Ayer [who also directed and Skip Woods I think created a very violent but very entertaining world here. Sure not all characters are not likeable but I feel like that is what drives the film. You want to see bad things happen because this is that kind of movie. Now don't think for one second that this is what the film is only about, the movie actually has some good acting as well as some over the top ones. All of it together makes for a really fun film and one that I think should have done better.

 With the combo pack you get deleted scenes, different endings, and a making of which I always enjoy. I really wish there would have been a commentary as those are always my favorite extra features. Still this was a good film that while not the best Arnold flick ever it is still better than its box office would tell you. I say give it a try because you may enjoy it.",1421712000,,1979,4.12987012987013

6390414,3,B00JU94ZPS,"Arnold Schwarzeneggers latest movie Sabotage attempts to be two things at the same time: action movie with realistic combats and Agatha Christine-like murder mystery. You may not believe me, but this is exactly what director David Ayer (End of Watch) is trying to do. Does it work? Well, I don't think so.

The film starts with a raid on a drug cartel, by a DEA team led by Breacher (Schwarzenegger). They steal the cartels money, $10 million, and hide it temporarily so that they can retrieve it later. But the money goes missing, and what is worse, the former members of the disbanded team gets killed one after another in a bizarre way.

I understand Schwarzenegger wants to do something different, something more edgy and story-oriented than his previous works, but I don't see the point of the film which tries too hard, taking itself too seriously. I find it hard to believe that more than one elite DEA agent gets killed just like that.

It is not just unbelievable; you really don't care if one of the cardboard characters gets killed. By the time the film finally reveals the truth, we will lose interest in the film.",1421625600,,1126,4.6767676767676765

As for the ""whodunit"" component, it was fairly obvious from the beginning who was off the reservation despite a couple of attempts to make you question the obvious.

6390431,3,B00JU94ZPS,"If you are looking for a film like Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"" or ""Raw Deal"", then you may be disappointed with ""Sabotage"".

""Sabotage"" is kind of a bridge from Schwarzenegger's old action films, to what I hope is a turn to more mature film roles for the aging star. Schwarzenegger plays ""Breacher"", the leader of an elite group of undercover DEA agents. During a raid on a cartel's warehouse, the team steals $10 Million dollars by hiding it in the warehouse sewer system. When the team returns after the raid to retrieve the cash, it's gone. Suspicion falls on the team when the money is discovered missing, and they are suspended for several months. But after repeated questioning, the investigation falls flat and Breacher and his team are reinstated. It's not long after their reinstatement that someone begins picking off the team members one by one.

There are a few surprises here and there, and the story moves along at a quick, bloody pace. I think the biggest problem with ""Sabotage"" is the casting of Schwarzenegger in the lead role. I never buy him as the hard-nosed leader of this rogue group of agents. It's almost like he's playing the typical ""lone wolf"" type character he's played in the past, and when his team members start dying, he seems unfazed and uncaring? There are no likable characters in the movie, and very little character development. Mireille Enos (""The Killing"" and ""World War Z"") as Lizzy Murray is probably the standout from the cast, as she puts in a great performance, chewing up scenery left and right. I'm so used to her playing quiet, introverted characters that it was about 20 minutes into the film before I realized she was the same actress that stars in ""The Killing"".

I would say ""Sabotage"" is worth a rental at least, but not a purchase as this is a film I wouldn't re-visit.",1419206400,,1823,4.744479495268139

6390435,2,B00JU94ZPS,"This started out a bit far-fetched, but had an interesting enough opening. Pretty good premise. But, no matter how hard I tried to ignore, they REFUSED to let me, spitting out the F-word as rapid fire as the machine guns they were using. What is wrong with these clowns? Do they truly think the box office head count is in direct proportion to the number of times they can use the word? I'm no prude, but this is beyond absurd. I don't give a ROYAL RIP what the friggin' word is; you cannot keep repeating the same adjective ad infinitum without it becoming tedious. Think about it!

6390437,3,B00JU94ZPS,"In Sabotage, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a seasoned DEA agent who leads an undercover special ops team, made up almost entirely of testosterone-fueled frat-boy types who appear to be suffering from severe cases of arrested development. It seems that Agent Wharton has managed to rope his buddies into stealing $10 million in drug money during a sting operation. When the loot goes mysteriously missing, the members of the team start being knocked off one by one. The question becomes is it the cartel whose money was stolen the ones doing the killing or are the murders being carried out by one of the groups own? Olivia Williams appears as the abrasive homicide detective whose job it is to investigate the killings.

This bad-cop version of Ten Little Indians has many of the elements of your typical overwrought action picture, but the fact that it isn't afraid to incorporate at least some level of moral ambiguity into its characters and storyline redeems it to some extent.

6390447,2,B00JU94ZPS,"didn't suck but could've been alot better.

strengths:
1. good acting;
2. believable DEA undercover party lifestyle featuring strippers, beer, etc. perhaps to relieve stress of high pressure job;
3. liked documentary shooting style.

weaknesses:
1. DEA probably has thousands of undercover agents worldwide. in real life they wouldn't be able to keep agents if agents had to fear that their families would be targeted by drug cartels. imagine that if families of agents began to be targeted the DEA and all security agencies would come down on cartels like a ton of bricks. a lone DEA agent who had his family tortured and murdered would not have to go rogue to get revenge - the government would have his/her back. so for me, though I admit ignorance of DEA's policies regarding employee's and their loved one's protection, felt totally bogus that the DEA wouldn't try to seek justice on agent's behalf;
2. mistake for writers to introduce agents as criminals. that they stole from cartels is not what I got, that they stole from the government and the American people was my takeaway. criminals stealing from criminals works in a franchise like Fast & Furious, but for me, not when officers are depicted as stealing - in my opinion, officers have a higher duty than criminals so Fast & Furious thieves stealing from thieves works, but here American officers stealing from the DEA isn't acceptable. the writer should've at the very least given a solid explanation for why they stole the money. risking their jobs and prison for John didn't work for me, even given the loss of his family;
3. agents weren't well written, not individual enough. no reason to care for them;
4. the story of a team of undercover agents imploding was not interesting to me - why did writers feel this story needed to be told? have no idea;
5. found it unbelievable that in a small tightly knit group that depended on each other for their survival, that one agent would cheat with another agent's wife, all within the group, and that no one knew about it;
6. agent's stole about a million apiece and when that went missing, the woman agent went crazy, but a million dollars is not enough money for her to have flipped out, even with her drug problem. assuming that the actors are depicting high level undercover drug agents, they must be making a good salary, at least $100k annually (admittedly I'm guessing). For someone earning a decent salary like that, flipping out over a million doesn't make sense;
7. Arnold Schwarenager (sp?)'s character plays a thief, a liar and a murderer, all to get revenge. I wish he'd been written more appealingly",1417219200,3,2624,4.777533039647577

Sabotage is the Governor's third starring role since returning from his stint in politics, and it's easily his best one to date. Schwarzenegger stars as Breacher, the commander of an elite DEA swat team, who agrees to help his under appreciated team take part in the theft of millions of dollars, from a top cartel boss. The heist goes relatively smoothly, but when the team goes to retrieve their money, they discover that one of them double crossed the rest and had stolen the pay day. Everyone is upset and trying to figure out who it was, when the cartel shows up looking for retribution. As the cartel picks off the team one by one, the remaining members have to ban together to try and stop them, except this time, they have to do it knowing that one of them is a trader. Arnold isn't doing the crazy stunts or fighting scenes that he's become synonymous for, he's in more of a leadership role in this film, but he's still the man when it comes to action films. Here he's paired with the Killing's Mireille Enos, who as the only female member of the team, gives an amazing performance. I'm used to her always playing these quiet, reserved, troubled characters, and it was a real treat to see her break out as the wild girl on a team full of men. Sabotage is the rarest of Action films, as it is one with a great storyline, that is as gripping as any drama. The film isn't just about killing people and blowing things up, it has plenty of that, but in the case of Sabotage, there is a reason for all of it, and this film will really keep you on the edge of your seat.",1416873600,,1633,4.288025889967638

6390461,2,B00JU94ZPS,"No, no, no.

Arnold has gone the way of Steven Segal.  Third rate action ""thrillers"".

Before you view this movie, watch Predator.  In that film Arnold plays the same character (Dutch instead of Boss, or Sergeant) but he is leading a team of professionals in Predator.  They act like professionals.  In Sabotage he is leading a band of neurotic, psychotic misfits.  All of them have anger-management problems, and are incompetent at doing their respective assignments.  All of them should be on Lithium or Prozac or Thorazine.  And these character disorders do not add to the excitement of the film.  It makes you think they are stupid and should never be allowed near a gun.  One ""loose cannon"" in an ""elite"" military group is acceptable, but for the entire squad to be nuts is absurd.

Yes, there is a slight ""surprise"" twist to the ending, but not enough of a surprise to make you sit through the entire film.

PLOT SPOILER:

At the very end, Arnold goes into the bad guys bar to kill three of the bad guys who killed his family.  Being a professional, don't you think he would have worn a bullet-proof vest under his shirt?  If you want to say he was on a suicide mission, then why bring a gun, why not just strap 20 lbs of C4 to you?  Think of the odds with a gun: Three bad guys, one you.  Odds are at least one of the bad guys will shoot you, therefore you do not accomplish your revenge mission of killing them all.  With C4 explosive, you kill every one -- especially the 3 bad guys -- in a one block radius of the place, if suicide is your goal.  By the way, everyone within a one block radius of the bar are bad guys.",1415923200,2,1628,4.327814569536423

In between the excellent ""End of Watch"" from 2012 and the just released (Oct. 2014) and equally good ""Fury"" director and screenwriter David Ayer piloted this over-baked bloody mess.  To its credit, the film features a credible performance from the governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Wharton, the leader of a DEA undercover unit.

They have just infiltrated a drug lord's manse and managed to locate a large pile of dollars.  Many millions of dollars.  The squad, acting in concert, sequester a large chunk of the money for pick up later and blow up the rest.  I'm not quite sure why they had to blow up the rest of the money as their backup was on their way and would have confiscated it.  When they return to get the stash, it's missing.  In any case Wharton and his crew are suspected of heisting the money, but have no proof.

Eventually, Wharton is sent back into action, rescuing his crew from each other while living together in a garbage infested house.  John's crew is made up of trite comic book-like characters.  A hardly recognizable Sam Worthington is `Monster' Murray who is married to Lizzy played by Mireille Enos.  Her character must have been a refreshing departure from the repressed cop she played on TV's ""The Killing.""  Here she's a strung out warrior who seemingly wants to bang the rest of the crew, husband be damned.  Terrence Howard is `Sugar', Josh Holloway is `Neck', Joe Manganiello is `Grinder', Max Martini is `Pyro', Mark Schlegel is `Smoke' and Kevin Vance is `Tripod'.  None are particularly likeable.

One by one they become a victim (in reverse order of their paycheck/billing), killed in a vicious way, reminiscent of the Mexican cartels they have just raided.  John teams up with a local cop (Olivia Williams) to discover who's doing the killing.  One thing we've learned from Ayer is that he doesn't shy away from violence and likes to put it all on the screen including all the blood and guts.  I'm guessing the budget for visual effects, sets and makeup was broken.

The biggest problem with the film isn't so much the story, the acting or the direction.  It's the absurd screenplay by Ayer and Skip Woods.  I was laughing and some of the dialog, and not when I should have been.  In the end, even after secrets are revealed, this is just an old fashioned revenge film.  And not a very good one.

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p resolution with an original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The digitally shot movie looks very good.  Detail is excellent.  Skin tones are realistic and the colors are bold and accurate.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is also very good if not exceptional.  For a high powered action film I was expecting a lot more from the surrounds.  Perhaps that's a bit overly critical because I didn't notice it at the time.  The dialog is clear and properly focused up front.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Extras include a making of featurette, some deleted scenes, a couple alternate endings and some studio trailers.",1414022400,,3048,4.731939163498099

He seems less wooden and gives the audience more emotion than normal for a heavy action flick. And there isn't any apparent CGI, so a great deal of effort was put into staging the scenes. Plenty of heart-stopping action with very realistic results.

But two issues really stand out that almost had me turning the movie off. The first was the language. Is it really necessary to drop an f-bomb into every sentence that involves any level of tension? Is this the only way to prove that someone is tough? There was so much swearing going on that at times it was difficult to follow a conversation. The other issue is that while the scenes were realistic, this is one REALLY gory movie.

Im giving this an Okay rating as I can recognize what was done well while acknowledging that the swearing and the gore were more than I enjoy watching.

Members of their team start to be killed and the question is who is doing it and is it about the missing money or a drug cartel's revenge.  A local homicide team gets pulled into the fray because of the murders.  Intriguing storyline and plenty of exciting action to keep you entertained and Schwarzenegger does a good job of not dominating the whole film and giving room for the story to develop.  The only flaw I saw was that if they blew up the money at the beginning, most of it burning, how come the FBI was so sure that ten million was missing.

In his performance he gives dark shading to his classic action hero much like John Wayne did with his Western archetype in ""The Searchers"".  I also liked the byplay between Schwarzenegger and Olivia Williams who plays an androgynous Atlanta homicide detective.  With all these superlatives the film isn't without its flaws.  The plot has any number of holes and inconsistencies.  Also Schwarzenegger's renegade DEA squad is comprised of foul-mouthed unsympathetic louts who you really don't care if they're getting bumped off.

6390504,3,B00JU94ZPS,"Buckets of blood & entrails peppered with as many f-words as possible & a hastily scrawled plot is the movie, Sabotage. Olivia Williams (Ghost [Writer] - Ruth Lang) gives an absolutely stellar performance as southern-drawled local Atlanta Police Department lead homicide investigator, Caroline Brentwood. Compared to the overacted & supposed-to-be raw-edged performance of Mireille Enos (The Killing - Sarah Linden) as married DEA agent Lizzy Murray, Williams nudged my review up by one star. Enos' too bright smile, open-too-wide eyes & self-destructive mien is more on par with someone who is mentally ill than reckless.

Arnold's performance as the taciturn patriarch of the band of crude DEA hooligans was...well, taciturn. His most expressive moment was when he became outraged by two federal interrogators & stormed out leaving in his wake a scathing insult - don't scream at me, you dumb f***, you - with your 48% body fat & you - you scroungy bastard."" I can think of menacing word salads with a more petrifying punch. Between having a cigar clenched between his front teeth & his accent, Arnold's delivery of dialogue reeks as much as the scripting itself.

With nicknames of Grinder, Neck, Tripod, Pyro, Sugar, Monster etc. the DEA agents are rather one-dimensional. We see them as beyond crass people who happen to be DEA agents. We see them steal drug money for personal gain. We see them kill, abuse drugs, get stinking drunk, beat up people because they can, insult investigator Brentwood, & womanize. Who are we supposed to be rooting for? Each agent is introduced during an interrogation session and their unsavory pasts are hinted. Conversely, we later learn that one agent used to be a Navy Seal. Their value as DEA agents is not disclosed. Agent ""Monster"" (Sam Worthington) tells APD Brentwood that they act as undercover agents infiltrating drug cartels. He shows her smartphone photos of dead enemies of the cartel who were also eviscerated. This is the only hint that their jobs are a nightmare & have sent them into the tailspin in behavior we see. Since we haven't been allowed to know just how horrific, we cannot be too sympathetic with their coping mechanisms. Arnold's character (John 'Breacher' Wharton) has suffered the loss of his wife & son by drugs lords who tortured them on camera and sent pieces of them to him over a long period of time. One wonders why he is still on active duty. We know he must be broken in some way, but we are only allowed to know that he watches the torture videos every night and later, that his team members think that he is obsessed with revenge.

In summary, this movie is about a plot to steal drug cartel money by DEA agents & after the money disappears, the agents are targeted one-by-one by an unknown killer. The DEA team lives a hard-partying, rabble-rousing lifestyle & apparently can be drug addicted, alcoholic, & prostitute-patronizing & continue to be employed by the federal government. All the agents in the movie seem to be able to function far longer in a hail of bullets (& bullets are flying everywhere) than is humanly possible. I think this movie was more suitable with some modification as a dark, horror-comedy.",1411776000,,3196,4.903881700554528

6390517,3,B00JU94ZPS,"OH Arnold......what were you thinking????  This is not a really horrible movie, and always nice to see Arnold, but a very disjointed movie.  When see DVD extras, deleted scenes, and realize that they tried to change emphasis of his character, understand where they went wrong.  SPOILER ALERT....I WILL TRY NOT TO BE TOO SPECIFIC BUT IF YOU WATCHED MOVIE YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT I MEAN......They partially changed a scene near end, where bad guy talking it up, but left in the female FBI agent's reaction to Arnold's characters action, that was totally unnecessary and very confusing. He reason for his action was clear in that version, although bad guy running mouth, also went for gun, so not the mystery they made it out to be.  Also given that Arnold's character and agent slept together, and she was given info about his personal past, you would think she would have pieced things together rather than wander around confused. Realize they wanted him to be hero, which is fine, that would have stayed in character as to what we had a sketchy understanding of character's life.  It is just that in removing part of movie that they reveal him as being surprise bad guy, they did not fix it properly.  Earlier portions of story also very disjointed. No real character building and only brief explanation as to why the good guy DEA agents had to act the way they do. I guess you just don't form any connection with any character, so when bodies start dropping it is more of like a slasher film than shock that these people protecting us from drug dealers are falling.  They just needed a bit more explanations.....just a bunch of fixes.  Seemed it was released before it was complete.  Not fully developed story. They also removed all scenes about subplot, but left in some dialog concerning it, just weird.  Shame, this probably could have been a really good movie.

6390519,5,B00JU94ZPS,"Well made movie, good acting, very interesting plot...and of course lots of action.  I was surprised that the movie didn't have any sex scenes, which for an action movie with lots of profanity is odd.  Getting back to foul language, I don't understand those people who were put off by the curse words in this film,...what did you expect? that they will speak a Shakespearean English? If you did not like Sabotage (2014) because of a ""presumably big amount of curse words"" used by the characters, than go watch a Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, and leave movies like Sabotage to people who live in real world and not fantasy.  Schwarzenegger even in his senior years is still kicking azz, and if you enjoyed watching The Last Stand with him (2013)------- -----you will like this one as well.

What really makes this movie is the intrigue and characters. The ""conspiracy"" plot is very-much Hitchcockian.  Sabotage reminded me of David Ayer's acclaimed action movie the Training Day (2001).  As a matter of fact,  Sabotage is very similar in nature to the Training Day and S.W.A.T. (2003).  You have the good characters, and the semi-good characters, and of course the bad guys or gals.  What also makes these movies similar are the: betrayals, revenge, redemption, and intense endings with the main hero being...$@#!%^ ---One thing is certain, David Ayer's films really stand out from all the other action movies produced in Hollywood these days.",1410739200,,1447,4.897540983606557

I have watched every one of your movies and since I was a boy of the 80's, I pledged my allegiance to you for life, so I must watch your films, no matter how bad they may be. But you are really putting strain on our relationship. This was such a test of faith. Your new post-governor phase of films are all terrible and I have watched them all, but this is the worst. It might seem like it's not, because it so ""gritty"" and ""cool"" and violent and directed by the writer of ""Training Day"" WOW! Everything about this movie is screaming and obnoxious, it feels like all your fellow actors and crew were on meth or playing a joke on you. In short, you look lost. You're old school, and yet I'm willing to see you try new things. I actually think you gave a good performance in Escape. I don't think you wanted this to be a post-modern satire on violence in movies. Is that what this was? Nah, can't be. You kind of did that with Last Action Hero. No, I think this was an attempt to be really ""edgy"" and ""intense"", and the only intense feeling this elicited was repulsion. We both know you have chopped, maimed, shot, stabbed, gouged and hurt hundreds of baddies in so many pioneering ways, but this is just so Sado-Masochistic, unrealistic, all male-posturing bull and no heart. Every single character is so unlikable, even you are a serious DB in this movie. Is it the lack of humor? We know you are at your best when there is an element of mocking to your persona and this has none of that. Sigh, I don't really want to get into spoiler territory, or even bother with specifics, because it's just too exhausting to rehash this steaming pile of cinematic garbage, but let's just say that there is not one good performance, moment, or scene. I kept waiting for the movie to change, because surely the entire movie can't be this - a cinematic version of a death metal band playing one four bar riff for and hour and fifty minutes?

I pray that this will be the nadir of our relationship and we'll be happier from here on out, and most importantly that this will not ruin your place in the pantheon of action gods. I pray...",1410220800,8,2161,4.322660098522167

I don't understand why people think it's cool to use the f-word or any other curse word over and over and over on a movie.  It ruins the enjoyment.  Literally, nearly every second there's ""f-this, f-that, f-you, what-the-f"" etc.
Number two: Arnold is getting for too old to do many more action films.  I liked Escape Plan but this one? Nah! It seems Arnold tries too hard to be the tough guy anymore.  I don't know.

I would say this is probably the most violent flick Arnold has ever done. And they drop the F-Bomb as much as the original Robocop movie. Which, I believe, actually detracts from the movie itself. I'm not a stick in the mud. I just think it's pointless having it be every other word! But, these really aren't good/nice people. And if that's what the director was going for, he pulled it off.

Drug deals gone wrong... competing gangs... corrupt government officials... and a DEA team (under Arnold) that disintegrates under criticism, suspicion, and a hatred the the team members develop for each other.  It's all just such a drag, in a 21st Century where nearly everything is becoming more and more of a drag everyday, anyway.  There's nothing interesting or clever about this movie.  It is ultra-violent, ultra-profane (how many times does ANYBODY use the ""F"" word in a normal conversation?), and it just leaves you feeling gutted and depressed by the ending.

The movie has a lot of action and gory which depending on your interest's that could be a good thing or a bad thing. This movie has been ripped apart by critics and I don't really see why. My only dislike for the film was the plot twist.

SPOILER ALERT: STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT SPOILED.

It was easy to tell that the killings were an inside job. It never had the feel that the cartel was there to kill them off for the money. The fact that Lizzy and Sugar were the killers was dull and had no pay off as far as a big plot twist.",1407801600,,635,4.072

The film begins as Ah-nold is watching his wife and son being tortured by members of a drug cartel on a video on a lap top..It seems(in details that come out as the movie progresses)that he and his gang of DEA misfits captured the ringleader of a Mexican drug cartel years before. During the hand over one of the Mexican cops shoots the leader dead. Before they leave Ah-nold is contacted and told the cartel is holding his wife and son. If he wants to see them released unharmed he must turn himself over to them. His fellow DEA members talk him out of it and they high tail it back to the U.S.For months after Ah-nold gets body parts mailed back to him. He becomes obsessed with getting the killer(s)who did his family in. He goes back to Mexico but cannot get the people responsible and members of his DEA team bring him back.
Fast forward to the present and Ah-nold and his DEA gang have intercepted $10 million in drug money. It is their plan to take most of it and blow up the rest. This they do but when they come back to get the stashed bucks,it has disappeared. Slowly  members of the team starts being picked off. Also the DEA team is investigated by their superiors,but it eventually goes nowhere. It seems Ah-nold has some inside pull after all these years.
The murders mount to more than half of the eight DEA team and the local cops now get involved much to Ah-nolds chagrin. In the end he plays the local cops like violins and is able to get a jump ahead on the action as a result. The Cartel sends four of its best hit men up, but three are found chest up in a local river,while the other is dead at the scene of one of the DEA members murders. Who has offed the assassins?
As the movie gets down to the nitty gritty we find out that two of the DEA agents have been in on their friends killings all along and want the money for themselves. A final chase(a prerequisite in any cop movie,right?) comes as Ah-nold and one of the local cops,are chasing the two traitors down. The driver gets killed in a crash and his accomplice sits bleeding to death in the back trunk. Ah-nold stands talking to the person and admits it was HE who stole the money. Before he can be shot at,Ah-nold shoots his ex team mate dead. As other local cops arrive on the scene, Ah-nold makes a hasty exit and disappears. The film's finale has Ah-nold back in Mexico bribing an official there to finally get the name and whereabouts of the killer(s)of his family. He enters a bar and shoots everything that moves,including the one who appeared on the video. However Ah-nold gets shot also and the film fades to black as he sits smoking a stogie and having a drink.
While the film could be a little hard to follow from just the dialogue alone,the most important thing to me was that it just never got up enough steam to turn my crank whatsoever. We have seen these types of films ad infinitum over the years,and all with the same traits such as rag tag,adrenaline pumped cops,another drug cartel,betrayal from within,and shoot-em-ups galore with the tag along violence,blood and gore. Now the better ones tend to give them a nice twist or two to shake things up,but in this one I could see the Ah-nold revelation coming not far into the film,even though they edited it so you only gleaned little bits at a time. Even though Ah-nold was the star,he couldn't even get up enough hutz-pah to liven things up or even go so far as to stick out amongst the rest.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras,surprise,surprise.
All in all this oh-so typical cops and bad guys drug film with a weak twist at the end, is certainly not one of Ah-nolds better films. Go watch The Last Stand or Escape Plan for something a little better in his more recent offerings. I'd give this one a pass. 2 1/2 stars.",1406678400,,4108,4.461436170212766

6390587,3,B00JU94ZPS,"The law must have done something really bad to writer/director David Ayer for him to make cops look like such despicable douche bags film, after film, after film, after film. ""Training Day,"" ""Dark Blue,"" and ""Harsh Times"" were all leading up to ""Sabotage,"" Ayer's newest and most brutal entry in the genre, although 2012's ""End of Watch"" may have made it an unexpected return to form as it depicted its protagonists with a sense of nobility. Here nearly every character is a loathsome pig and the longer the narrative unspools without character arcs, the more dismal and infected we become with their presence.

film opens with Arnold Schwarzenegger watching (and later we re-watching) a video of his family being tortured by a Mexican drug cartel (if that doesn't warn you about what you're getting into nothing will). From there, it takes us to his DEA task force infiltrating a cartel hot spot, and stashing $10 million of the cartel's money down a sewer pipe for safe and completely unorthodox keeping. Only when they come to collect their $10 million cash and find that it's missing, the Bureau begins a six-month long investigation into the missing money that splits the team up. Once the investigation fails to turn up anything useful, Schwarzenegger and his merry band of badge-carrying thugs are back on the job, while each are being murdered, one by one, for their past sins by an unknown, yet assumed, group of assassins.

The story has enough twists, turns, loops, and holes to keep one interested, along with confident acting that probably no one was expecting what with Schwarzenegger given top billing (he's actually pretty good here), but there's also a dose of brutality associated with it that can and will turn some viewers off. The gore can be pretty unsettling at times (the excess at some points seems to be done to test a viewer's tolerance for it as opposed to being a narrative necessity) and the fact that 99% of the task force act like repulsive a-holes can make ""Sabotage"" a film that's hard to embrace. Still, for those of you with iron stomachs, like myself, ""Sabotage,"" despite it's Michael Myers penchant for emotion, will resound as a weekend afternoon thriller worthy of your time. And for what it's worth, the two detectives working the case of the dying DEA agents (played by Olivia Williams and Harold Perrineau) provide brief moments of nobility (maybe not clean, but close) that help us to swallow the spoonful of cocaine and depravity Ayer gives us via Mireille Enos' balls-out performance (""The Killing's"" Sarah Linden like you've never seen her before and hope you don't see again).

""Sabotage"" is messy and dark, but better than the mud it's been dragged through by other critics. I say give it a shot if you like your cop dramas dirty and stay away from it if you don't.",1406505600,19,2814,4.821946169772256

6390597,2,B00JU94ZPS,"I know Hollywood's not necessarily begging Arnold to headline big-budget movies anymore, but I don't know why he keeps settling for such mediocre fare. Despite the face that some bigtime stars like Terrence Howard, Josh Holloway and Sam Worthington are playing backup to Ahnuld, this is still a completely unoriginal, straight-to-video type movie with limited budget, scenery, action and tired cliched characters. Despite the cast, the best character is actually played by a relative unknown because he's the only one who cuts loose compared to everyone else's identical uptight tough-guy schtick.

The only plot this whodunnit film has is its unrelenting triple-crossing twists, which come so often, that its impossible to really care about any of the characters. Are they good or bad, right or wrong? Check again ten minutes from now, and see if it even matters.

Considering his post-governor roles, Arnold seems to have comfortably settled into these grizzled old veteran heroes, but despite the age, he's always been at his best playing an over-the-top machine. I know he actually is an old guy now, but perhaps one of these new films will let him go nuts again as the alpha warrior, because movies are, you know, like, pretend.",1406073600,2,1233,5.129353233830845
6390598,2,B00JU94ZPS,"Having watched Schwarzenegger's last starring role--The Last Stand--I was interested in seeing Sabotage. Big mistake. This movie feels like it was written by teenage boys. It desperately tries to be edgy by dropping enough F-bombs to level a small country; every other word is (blank). The promise of tactical team-based action is never fully delivered on, as most of the characters are morally bankrupt white trash who consistently fail to get on the same page. Individually, I like all the actors in this film, but they've been crammed into a big mess here.

John 'Breacher' Wharton (Schwarzenegger) is the head of a special D.E.A. task force and they are the best at what they do. After taking down a local cartel's safe house they find an enormous pile of cash. Before announcing the all clear they skim a little off the top. Later that day when they go back to claim their reward they find it missing. The once close team now has a hard time trusting each other and the distrust turns deadly. First thing I have to say is that going into this I wasn't excited. I like Schwarzenegger OK but his movies are pretty much just look what I can kill and blow up in a few hours with no real story. I was expecting more of the same with this one. While it did start off that way the movie really became something I had never seen in one of his movies...suspenseful. The movie keeps you guessing as to who took the money and who is killing the members off. The fact that it keeps you wondering really helps the pacing of the movie and it really moves along quick. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is amazing and one of the best movies of the year but I will say this is Schwarzenegger's best since his return and one of his best ever. I surprisingly enjoyed this a lot and recommend it if you are looking for a great action movie. Overall, I liked it much much more then I was expecting to.

6390610,4,B00JU94ZPS,"The Good-  Arnold gives his most controlled performance to date.  He shows emotion and shows an acting range which fans will find surprising.  And as usual, Arnold has some funny zingers.  The action is realistic and gritty.  Nothing that happens in terms of action is far fetched (only slightly).  The blood in this movie is done old school where they busted out the blood bags/squibs.  No polished looking CG blood here (this movie is extremely bloody).  The rapport the characters have with each other is believable and occasionally witty.  The story rolls along and gives a nice back story to the characters.  The plot unfolds and it's interesting.  It is not a Michael Bay-style blow'em up, no/convulted plot movie.
The Bad-  The plot has several twists and turns.  In one instance, they leave a loose end for a very important plot point leaving you to make a big assumption.  There is also a strange development between two characters that comes out of nowhere, leaving you like 'huh?'.  No build up to it whatsoever.
The Deal-  This is a fine addition to Schwarzenegger's catalog. This movie has extremely violent action, suspense, comedy, and an overall good story.  This movie did not deserve to bomb the way it did at the box office.  But I don't think people want to see ultra-violent films like this one and would rather see super-hero action.

The director was probably more interested in everything else going on than getting the whole truth wrung out of the performances at all times.  To be fair, they're acceptable.  The looks (right down to the hair cuts, tats, digs, etc), written dialogue (side-step the how of the delivery to the what), procedures, tactics, close quarters shooting, and everything else visual, staged, set, decorated, or action-sequenced was essentially real as can be for a movie.  There are times when I was taken aback by just how non-movie-like and live footage it appeared, from gun shot wounds, to accident scenes, to just the physical mannerisms of the operators.  There's a lot of practice and training with professionals that went into the main cast's outcome.  Research also being done now by some writers, directors, and production staff, not to mention the stunts, squibs, and effects have come pretty much to the point of producing a sort of total realism.  These people dug into their subject matter and did something unique.  I have a lot of respect for what they pulled off in this film, and though the delivery could have occasionally been better, doing so might have compromised casting or the emphasis elsewhere in their shoot.  Maybe I'm being too kind, but spending all your time listening for something like natural voice inflections probably isn't the best use of attention when directing this type of movie... or this particular cast.
