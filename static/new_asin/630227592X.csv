The video was made in 1991 so you'll be getting the fairy tale story that I suppose most of us still believed in back then and is about 45 minutes long.",996537600,4,270,4.018518518518518
7824073,5,630227592X,"I bought this video to commemorate a time when Charles and Diana were the IT couple in my life - the stunning beauty made good, and the man who put her where she was.  I adored her and bought this video for more of an insight in to what their life may have been like.  Since her death Charles has 'made good', and has become the father and man she always wanted him to be.  She would be proud and this video should be viewed with the insight in to the man we now know, not as the man he was to her then.  A fine tribute to the married times of our favourite lady.",970617600,15,563,3.869565217391304
