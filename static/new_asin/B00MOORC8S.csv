8673466,1,B00MOORC8S,"This is Shirley Clarke's last film. Its a real mess. Its an overproduced experimental film where the film and video gimmicks overwhelm the actual content (Ornette Coleman). Its good in the sense that it adds to the not large amount of material about Ornette Coleman available. There is a horrible MTV 1980s video music quality to the editing with all sorts of fast cuts and non-linear presentation. The techniques were praised when the film was released, but now they seem really dated. Its ironic that the technical limitations in 1950s and 1960s experimental film sometimes led to better work being produced.

Its probably better to listen to it than to watch it.",1510012800,,665,4.9375
8673467,1,B00MOORC8S,"In my love of ornette coleman, and my sheer devotion to 'the shape of jazz to come' album, i am so sad to say how disappointed i was watching this documentary...

It's hard to even call it a documentary...it's more like a director's mess laid on top of snippets of jazz...and it''s not just a bad concert or anything, i am talking about a head trip film that takes disadvantage of constant computer gimmicks and has nothing to do with coleman except for about an honest 3 minute piece shoved somewhere near the end...

the only reason i can even give it one star is because there is nothing else about ornette on dvd...but trust me...even that's being way too generous...stick with the albums and just close your eyes...otherwise your eyes will never forget how bad this is...",1481760000,2,776,4.615942028985507
8673468,1,B00MOORC8S,"An insult to a great musician. this dvd is awful, it is all about the doco director and her wonderful artistic insights, with Ornette Coleman's music in little snippers (never a full work) in the background to all sort of 'clever' graphics. If you are looking to remember one of the greats DON'T buy this dvd.",1435449600,5,309,4.535714285714286

8673472,5,B00MOORC8S,"Thanks to the folks a Milestone Video and UCLAs Film Restoration Team, filmmaker Shirley Clarkes 1986 documentary on jazz legend Ornette Coleman is getting this new release and looking better than it probably did nearly 30 years ago. Its both a documentary of Colemans life  pretty much narrated by Coleman himself  and a concert which bookends the 78 minute film. That concert is a gala concert in his hometown of Fort Worth Texas, where he received the Key to the City and then performed Skies of America on stage with the Fort Worth Orchestra and his own Prime Time Band. Clarke spent 30 years following Coleman and we see his son Denardo start on drums at a VERY young age and later watch as Ornette visits his old neighborhood. I won't repeat more of Ornettes stories as they are more fun discovering for yourself.

The bonuses on this Bluray make this a jazz collectors must0have. There is a 32 minute interview with Denardo, A 58-minute interview with Clarke, the audio of a radio interview with Clarke (28 more minutes), and a funny 5 minute short that Clarke made on why she loves Felix the Cat. Theres also a booklet with reminiscences of Coleman.

This could be one of the most important jazz videos of 2014. Highly recommend to modern jazz lovers.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
