8334218,2,B001PPGAPI,"Good thing about companies like Alpha is that they release movies that aren't available on a DVD by the major companies who originally released the movie. Bad thing about Alpha is, that the quality of the movies on their DVD's leaves much to be desired. For instance ""Peck's bad boy"", a movie I loved when I first saw it on TV years ago, has a soundtrack that doens't have a clear sound, which is the cause that some of the dialogue is impossible to understand. The last reel of the movie on this DVD is very bad, with pieces missing.
Also the movie on the DVD is a 'blown up' version, probably to avoid showing the brand of a company that broadcasted this movie on TV.

Alpha calls this DVD-release a 'special edition'. God knows why, because there's nothing special at all about it. Let's hope that some of the true gemms which still haven't been released by a major company and are only available by Alpha etc., will one day get a decent release in good quality.",1262822400,8,965,4.421348314606742
