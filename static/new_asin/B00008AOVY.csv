1832878,5,B00008AOVY,"""The Story of Will Rogers"" is one of the best film bios you'll find, matched  only by James Cagney's bio of George M Cohan - ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942). Interestingly enough, both Will Rogers (1879-1935) and George M Cohan (1878-1942) were contemporaries and both were involved in the entertainment industry, and both film bios were directed by Michael Curtiz.

This 1952 film stars Will Rogers Jr. in the title role. Jane Wyman appears as his wife, and the film is actually taken from Mrs. Rogers book ""My Life with Will Rogers"". A great supporting cast includes Slim Pickens, Noah Beery Jr., James Gleason, Jay Silverheels, and we even have Eddie Cantor playing himself.

Will Rogers (for those too young to remember) held a unique place in American culture - so unique it's difficult to describe. Take Johnny Carson, for example, at his prime, and then eliminate any of his competitors, remove him from the commercial arena, and you begin to get a glimpse of how influential Rogers was. He was a stage performer, film star, radio star, rodeo star, and stand up comedian before there was stand up. Journalists hounded him for comments on any major event, and he rarely disappointed them. His witticisms became part of the language. Here's a taste -

 * ""America has a unique record. We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives.""
 * ""Be thankful we're not getting all the government we're paying for.""
 * ""Everything is changing. People are taking the comedians seriously and the politicians as a joke.""
 * ""I belong to no organized party, I'm a Democrat.""
 * ""A senator got up today in Congress and called his fellow senators sons of wild jackasses. Now, if you think the senators were hot, imagine how the jackasses must feel.""

Will Rogers Jr. (1911-93) stars and he not only resembles his dad, but he's capable of the rope tricks that brought his dad to attention early in his career. He appeared in a half dozen films, usually as his dad, and as many TV shows. In 1942 he was elected to congress from Southern California and worked hard to save the Jews from extermination in Europe, but when those efforts failed, he resigned and re-joined the Army.

Beautiful Jane Wyman (1917-2007) is best known for her Oscar winning performance in ""Johnny Belinda"" and her recurring role as Angela Channing on ""Falcon Crest"" (1981-90). Other notable roles include ""Lost Weekend"" (1945), ""The Yearling"" (1946), ""The Glass Menagerie"" (1950), and ""Magnificent Obsession"" (1954). She racked up 4 Oscar nominations, 2 Emmy nominations, and won the Golden Globe 3 times. She was Ronald Reagan's first wife (1940-48). She is marvelous as Rogers' wife.

Slim Pickens (1919-1983) plays Rogers' long time sidekick. He's best remembered for his role as the cowboy who rides a nuclear bomb in ""Dr Strangelove"" (1941), but this was only one of more than 150 great film roles. Personally I never saw him give a bad performance, and I remember him best in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973) as the aging Sheriff Baker who is gut shot and sitting by the river with his wife Katy Jurado as Bob Dylan sings ""Knocking on Heaven's Door.""

The versatile James Gleason (1882-1959) appears as Rogers' agent. Gleason made more than 100 films and was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" (1941). I remember him best as Cuke Gillen in ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958).

Noah Beery Jr. (1913-94) appears as Wiley Post, the famous one-eyed aviator. Beery was the son of silent film star Noah Beery and nephew of 30s mega star Wallace Beery. He made more than 100 films but is probably best remembered for his roles on TV as James Garner's father in ""Rockford Files"" (1974-80) and Uncle Joey in ""Circus Boy"" (1956-7).

Jay Silverheels (1912-80) has a small role as an Indian who grew up with Rogers. We know him best as Tonto from ""The Lone Ranger"" TV series (1949-57).

Look real carefully and you'll see veteran actor Hank Worden (1901-92) as an Okie extra. He was a cowboy turned actor. He's best remembered for his role as `ol Mose in ""The Searchers"" (1956).

Eddie Cantor (1892-1964) appears as himself, in two scenes, both times in blackface. Will Rogers Jr. makes an appearance as Will Rogers Sr. in ""The Eddie Cantor Story"" (1953).

Michael Curtiz directed. Curtiz is best known for his work with Errol Flynn - they did a dozen films together including ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936),""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), and ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Without Flynn,  Curtiz received  2 Oscar nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney (""Angels with Dirty Faces"" in 1938 and ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" in 1941) and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"" in 1942), one of eight they made together. Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared ""The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself."" Curtiz  was a good friend of Rogers.

This film is not only good entertainment, it is a look at American society from 1920 to 1935. Definitely should be seen.",1290384000,11,5073,4.767123287671233
1832879,5,B00008AOVY,"So many young folks today might have heard his name before but know nothing about him. This movie was based on a book written by Mrs. Will Rogers and is full of fond memories and family and friends, and what it meant to be an American during very hard times (The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and The Great Depression). There are no hidden ""messages"" in this film and it might seem hokey to some but it is very enjoyable and is a great story. Will Rogers was a very great man - great in his efforts to help people. You will find his comments about politics applies to today's politics too! If you are looking for a film the family can watch and enjoy, then this one is for you. Fine performances by Jane Wyman and Will Rogers, Jr.",1285286400,9,727,4.2
1832880,5,B00008AOVY,The perfect combination with the great Bob Hope telling the story of the fabulous Will Rogers.  A must have for people that like Will Rogers.,1167955200,10,141,4.64
1832881,1,B00008AOVY,Please be aware that this is an NBC News documentary released in 1961. It is not the 1952 Michael Curtiz movie by the same name.,1057104000,14,128,4.16
1832882,5,B00008AOVY,"As I was born in 1955, I loved this movie. It made me remember our countries strong points are in each other. His life is an insperation to us all to be ourselves. Being 1/6 native american, I realy saw his point on some things. This movie is one of the best about a life and times I have seen, with the exception of Mark Twain. Our country needs more movies like this today. back to what we are and what makes us strong.",1004832000,17,421,4.023809523809524
1832910,5,B00008AOVY,"It's as I remember it (I recorded the audio from the 1961 airing.) It has portions of the film ""They had to see Paris"" which are no longer part of some DVD copies.",1464048000,,163,3.9696969696969697
1832911,5,B00008AOVY,"Apparently i liked this more than other people who saw it, but I really liked it. I enjoyed seeing the images of Will Rogers in action. They were some old clips of his early work, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching him throw that lasso and make some of his short speeches.",1453939200,,271,4.333333333333333

1832919,2,B00008AOVY,"Don't mistake this for an American Masters-styled bio-pic from PBS. It's a very superficial account of Rogers career with way too much filler. For example, to depict the period in which he starred in the Ziegfeld Follies, 90% of the footage shown are stock-shots of Ziegfeld's ""American Beauty"" show-girls. Just one photo each of his co-stars Fanny Brice and W.C. Fields. In other words, this is strictly a biography for the tired businessman. Not very informative. It's chief merit lies not in the writing, but the fact that they hired Bob Hope to narrate it. PS: If you buy the First Volume of Universal's WILL ROGERS COLLECTION, you'll get a superb A&E Biography of Rogers which is infinitely better than this film. As a Bonus, you'll also get 4 of Rogers best films along with the biography and all for $14.95...at least as of July 2014.",1406073600,7,841,4.767123287671233
1832940,5,B00008AOVY,"What an inspiring life of a man!  This is so refreshing and meaningful to watch.
We thoroughly enjoyed the humor and meaningful personality of Will Rogers.
He was a great American!",1399507200,,180,4.806451612903226
1832941,5,B00008AOVY,Anyone who wants to get to know Will Rogers better needs to watch this movie. The movie clips are excellent as are the actual words of Will. A true American hero.,1393459200,,162,4.258064516129032
1832942,5,B00008AOVY,I remember seeing this movie years ago and is based on a true story. Very enjoyable and Will Roger's humor is legendary at least to me if no one else,1392940800,,149,4.0

1832944,5,B00008AOVY,"Will Rogers is a GREAT family picture!  There is something for everyone in this beautifully done true story.  Will learned he could only be himself but his dad had other ideas.  There are lots of laughs with much too consider throughout the story.
Working harder is not always the answer as Will discovered and you will too as you watch the Story of Will Rogers!",1381190400,,362,4.538461538461538
1832945,4,B00008AOVY,"It was especially enjoyable to me since I am a history buff. I wish all our young people today could see this in their history classes at high school. Will Rogers was so full of common sense that he had a powerful influence on this country  including the power centered politicians. Nearly all of them wanted his blessing. I have heard his statement ""I never met a man I didn't like"" most of my life. I don't think our youth have ever heard that bit of wisdom. This is a very authoritative and enjoyable story of a great man.",1374105600,,525,4.303030303030303
1832946,5,B00008AOVY,I have been a Will Rogers fan for 65 years.  Thought I knew all bout him.  Wrong!  Great film clips and quotes and great Bob Hope commentary.,1368230400,,141,4.148148148148148
1832947,4,B00008AOVY,"Enjoyed the movie as it appears to be the only visual history available for Will Rogers.

However, the book by Ben Yagoda is a must read follow up.",1359504000,2,147,4.25
1832948,5,B00008AOVY,"It doesn't get any better from director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy, so many Errol Flynn pix) and stars Will Rogers, Jr., Jane Wyman, Noah Berry, Jr., and James Gleason.  It doesn't get any better than this.",1356048000,,227,4.973684210526316

7981050,5,B00008AOVY,"What an interesting story.  And what a simple brave man he was to say the obvious that no one else dared to mention - and usually with hilarious humor, so that nobody ended up feeling offended.  I got to see him when he was real young and doing his famous rope tricks, that I hadn't known about.  He was probably more skillful at handling a rope than anyone who ever lived - funny tricks too, to make people laugh.",1505347200,,414,4.215189873417722
