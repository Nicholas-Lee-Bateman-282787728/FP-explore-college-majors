8315697,3,B001KP2YAS,For some reason I just enjoy the Harlequin novels turned to movies. They are definitely not Oscar winning material but personally I enjoy them just the same. This one is not amongst my favorites but it is alright and for the price I say it was worth it to me.,1259971200,4,259,4.2
