2879307,5,B000S1MM8E,"This is a fun workout.  I like to incorporate as much cardio into my workout routine as I can and I get both cardio and toning with this one.  I thought the moves and the instructor were fun.  I workout everyday and I would consider myself an intermediate/advanced level.  The cardio was not overly challenging, but it is a nice option for days when I feel like I would like something lighter.  That is not to say I don't feel like I worked out, because let me tell you, I do feel the burn in [...].  That being said, I would really recommend this being added to any fitness dvd collection.  It is great for beginners just getting started and a nice option for those more experienced who are looking for something that will give them a good workout that is fun!",1188518400,29,761,4.316901408450704
2879308,5,B000S1MM8E,"I really like Crunch workouts and this one is another great one from them.  This is easy to follow and it's only 40 minutes all up so it won't be long before you're done with a great workout that is fun to do and helps you tone up.
It's made up of aerobic/toning intervals and they go in easy stages and progress to harder variations.  There aren't any ultra dancy moves so if you aren't co-ordinated you'll get this down.  All the moves (aerobic and toning) are done with a base move that you can stay with or move with the transitions into more intense moves.  I like this because you can get a more effective workout, or back down if you are working too hard.  The instructor, Teri, is outgoing and encouraging and the entire dvd is a lot of fun.  This is probably more geared for beginner to intermediate, but even if you are already quite fit, you'll still enjoy this a lot.  I do.",1187740800,69,886,4.269461077844311

I would recommend this for people who are apprehensive to going to a class at the gym and want to follow one in the comfort of their own home. I do this with some running or kickboxing on alternate days, and starting to see some great results. Mind you you probably also should alter eating healthy foods not just rely on great workout video to see the effects.

2879320,3,B000S1MM8E,"This video is an average video with an average workout. The instructor makes an impression of an amateur. You can join those kind of classes on holidays with animator's team at hotels.  They can teach you aerobics, water-polo or anything else.

What I liked here:

1) Mix of exercises. Variable and not much jumps.

What I disliked here:

1) I don't like her outfit and the look. She doesn't look slim and her trousers makes her butt to look bigger. When the video is named - belly butt and thighs bootcamp, I do expect to see the instructor who has her own bum fixed and in shape. If not - the video is missing the trustworthy and credibility.
2) The video doesn't have the clear structure. No segments, it simply jumps from one part to another
3) She doesn't sound as a professional trainer. The way she comments the moves, talk with the audience, etc.

The conclusion is - the animator video for ladies who needs to do some moves to feel more fit.

It is an average workout with no wow factor. But it gives you exercises for the bum. You wouldn't love it, you wouldn't hate it.",1426204800,,1080,4.396984924623116

I don't always get to the gym and want a good workout for home.  In good Crunch fashion, they have delivered a great workout.  Teri is an amazing instructor, easy to following and her routines are great.  I definately felt this work out in my glutes and quads.  I was sweating when I was done.

2879335,4,B000S1MM8E,"When you think of ""Bootcamp"" you probably imagine you are going to get yelled at. This workout is however much more playful. The exercises definitely work you out but there are different levels so you can feel comfortable. Whether you want to push your limits or just casually exercise there is something for everyone. Most of the high impact moves are optional and I avoided them. I still felt I got a good workout even when I modified some of the moves. I felt this workout mostly in my thighs and abs. This is over forty minutes but it felt like ten. That is how quickly it went.

2879336,3,B000S1MM8E,"I usually like Crunch fitness videos, but this one wasn't my fave. I don't like doing jump-and-jack exercises, as I find it too jarring on the spine. But, I suppose I should have expected that with a title called ""Bootcamp"". Still, the video is okay and I'll do it every once in a while. I do like that it's cardio but feels like it's toning well, too. I know Teri Ann is trying to be motivating, but I mostly feel that she's yelling at me. Again, I suppose that's to be expected for a Bootcamp workout. I personally prefer Pilates or Yoga, which you work your body hard yet in a more relaxed atmosphere. If you like working out with someone talking loudly at you to get you motivated, then this DVD is for you.",1388793600,,711,4.274074074074074

This one is a pretty straightforward workout, around 40 minutes long and just good old fashioned cardio.  The instructor does a good job of cueing and there are no fancy moves so keeping up is no problem.  I've seen this instructor in the background of a number of other workout DVDs so it was nice to see her out front and leading.

While not advanced, the workout does a pretty good job of working up a sweat and I burned a decent amount of calories.  Most definitely a keeper.",1367971200,,626,4.362068965517241

This one was great b/c it pushed me ( heart up) but not too hard where I said 'forget it!'. The moves are easy to follow, with short intervals ( so you don't get bored), host is fun and yes, you can feel the burn.  My favorite thing, perhaps, is that it is only about 40mins long - that's a relatively easy amount to fit in your day.

2879349,3,B000S1MM8E,I am particular about my instructors. This girl is too perky for me but the workout is very good. If I could only stand to get past the perkiness I would keep this workout because it really does work you out.,1362355200,,208,4.097560975609756

I want to get toned and fit and I think this dvd is just it I barely have a week with it, I have been alternating, two days working out with the video one day rest and two days working out etc..and so far the times I have worked out with this video has left me sore (saying it in the most positive way) I am keeping my routine and maybe add another of their DVDs for upper body and more cardio, but TRUST me YOU WILL FEEL THE BURN!",1326240000,,728,3.86

2879363,3,B000S1MM8E,"I own a majority of the Crunch videos, and they do the job pretty well. Many video ""giimicks"" annoy me. I don't want a fitness video that is shot outside, or on a set that looks like a living room. I like when there are a number of people behind the instructor, so it is like a class. Having just the instructor talking to the camera is too much like a trainer, which is a concept I find really offensive. I am not a puppy! Crunch videos provide fairly rigorous workouts that are not too repetitive, in a class format, with instructors that are not too cheery or robotic. This video goes through aerobics and toning moves for the lower body, the pace is good, and the choreography is interesting. The whistle around the instructor's neck at the beginning of the video is the only part that is like a bootcamp, so if you are looking for that style of workout, this is not it. The big problem with this, and all the Crunch videos is that they are not long enough. I work out for 60-90 minutes. Most of the Crunch videos are 30-40 minute. Yes, you can pair them up, but then you have to go through the whole intro/warm-up process, and it interrupts the flow.

I was concerned about the difficulty of any workout considering the only excercise I did for 9 months was walking. This DVD pleased me so much because it was easy to learn and fun to do. The cardio sections of the workout are the best. The toning sections are not really difficult, and I only felt ""the burn"" for a day or so at first.  The video mostly works the thighs, and the cardio generally helps lose weight in the belly. My husband has noticed my weight loss in just 2 weeks! I think with continued use of this workout I will get back to my pre-pregnancy body. I do fear that it will become too easy though and I will stop seeing results. But so far this has been an excellent workout to start on the road to getting back in shape. 2 weeks ago I couldn't get my favorite jeans on up past my mid-thigh.

I really wish she had more DVDs out. I've added this DVD to my morning rotation of workouts and I look forward to doing it each time.  The ONLY reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the yelling.

This DVD had easy to follow steps; this made it easy for me to push my self to the next level.

One thing: if you have bad knees and can't do lunges and squats, be aware that this dvd is essentially lunges, squats and more lunges.  Know your limits and always be aware of your joints.  If this is going to hurt your knees, do a smaller range of motion or don't do it at all.

On the whole I've really enjoyed using this dvd.  I would recommend it to anyone with good knees .",1244678400,7,596,4.212389380530974

I rated it 4 stars because I wish there was more arm work.  When I finish I definitely feel my lower body and I think it's a great video.  The hooting and hollering some complain about, it really doesn't distract from the workout.  I would recommend this video.",1242345600,3,526,4.427083333333333
2879381,5,B000S1MM8E,"Perfect for a beginner AND an advanced exerciser since the workout is broken out into Levels (1-4).  Broke a sweat but was able to modify the exercises based on my energy level/abilities.  Looking forward to using this video for a while!

Update 2 years later...I let myself get out of shape since my initial review, then 8 mo ago got back into the exercise groove. I started by using this DVD in addition to some Jillian Michael and Jackie Warner workouts and within 6 months I was, to be blunt, kicking booty. By rotating workouts using DVDs like this one, and changing my eating habits, I've shed over 40 lbs and am getting into great shape.  **IF** you are able to do lunges (good knees) and situps (good back), then this workout is AWESOME. You get what you put into this, and by listening to the instructor's advice (""SQUEEZE!"") and pushing yourself, you too can lose your fear of lunges! Not to mention gain some very nice butt muscle...  My goal back in Jan was to be able to do this entire DVD using perfect form. Now that I've happily met that goal, I've rotated different workouts into my repertoire but still use this one occasionally.

A few more notes... this workout can be ""adjusted"" to use minimal space and it requires NO equipment, so it's a great travel workout. I love the instructor, Teri Ann Krefting...so much so that I bought another workout she was in just because of her (hated the DVD, unfortunately, but that's not her fault, she was just doing it, not leading it). Last but not least, the cool down is fantastic - I often use Teri Ann's instead of others (like Jackie Warner, whose cool downs are seriously lacking).

Overall, increasing review to 5 stars since this DVD has been so fantastic for me!!",1240790400,,1731,4.564516129032258
2879382,4,B000S1MM8E,"This is a fast-paced, relatively fun cardio and toning workout for beginner & intermediate exercisers.  It is 41 minutes long so it is pretty easy to squeeze into your schedule.  The instructor gives good cues and it is easy to follow her instructions.  The moves are not challenging in that they are easy to follow, but they really get your heart rate pumping.  It was also nice to see several different body types doing the workout and they have one exerciser doing the beginner options for moves that are more advanced.  I liked this DVD because I felt that slight soreness in my muscles the next day that let me know that I worked out, which I really like.  I found that I mainly felt this workout in my butt, then my thighs and lastly my abs.  I also liked the instructor.  She gave good cues and was upbeat and encouraging without being obnoxious.  The music is the fairly typical techno, forgettable soundtrack and did not really add to the workout or detract from it in any way.

The DVD starts with a warm up section that is short - mainly marching, step touching and a few stretches.  Next phase is a cardio burst, which is 4 different moves that are linked together.  They are referred to as ""stages"" in that you can pick the stage that is best for you.  You can do all 4 of them or you can still with stage 1 or stage 2 for a lower impact, easier workout.  The higher stages typically involve jumping and/or knee lifts or something like that so they can really amp up your heart rate in no time.  Then you switch to a toning section.  The toning sections are mainly lunges, squats and other fairly normal exercises.  The nice part is that you work your abs in every section, but most of the abs sections are standing with upright crunches or other variations.  There are a total of 3 cardio bursts & 3 toning sections, ending on the floor with mat work for your abs.  Then there is a cool down and stretch section at the end.

My main complaint with the workout is the very short transition between the cardio bursts & toning sections.  I am not in very good shape right now, but I could keep up with all 4 stages of the cardio burst.  However, if I did all 4, then my heart rate was up in the higher section of my target heart rate range and I felt like I needed more time to bring it down before I stopped to do the toning sections.  I just paused the DVD and did some marching in place and then was able to resume.  The only part that I really disliked in the workout was the cooldown stretching section.  I am very inflexible and it was not enough stretching for me and I could not do many of the stretches the way that they were shown on the DVD.  I did my own stretches at the end while the credits were running and that seemed to do the trick.",1239321600,,2762,4.243295019157088

Lunges and sqauts really target your butt & thighs while providing a good cardio  workout (check your  heartrate to see the effect) while additioanl work on the abs and some stretching completes the workout.

I was looking to replace my aging VHS tape of Crunch's ""Brand New Butt"" (love the title, lol!) and this was the closest thing I could find on DVD. Turns out, I like this at least as well. Teri Ann Krefting is adorable, likable, and motivating. She cues very well and keeps to the beat of the music, starting every set at the top of a measure, just where you'd expect. The stretch at the end is among the best I've seen on any VHS/DVD workout.

The music is cheesy and in some places just plain weird. The now-famous ""hootin' and hollerin'"" is a little over-the-top. And whenever she ties her comments to the Boot Camp theme (""Keep your feet quiet, so the enemy can't hear you!"")...well, it's really goofy.

The video alternates segments of cardio with lower-body toning, and toward the end you get a couple good total body moves incorporated. A short-but-effective abs segment at the end incorporates a couple really tough moves. You also get about 5 minutes of nice stretching at the very end.

I would highly recommend this video for anyone who wants to tone up the buns, hamstrings, inner/outer thighs and abs. If you're looking for upper body work, you won't get a lot of it here, but your heartrate will stay up throughout the video. Another bonus: no equipment needed (save a sticky mat if you want one for the abs section).I would recommend this if you like Crunch Boot Camp Training or other boot-camp style workouts.",1206489600,19,1058,4.713513513513513
