7463605,5,B01690GTKY,Breath taking. They have managed to portray the Virgin Mary perfectly.  I love how they kept it so close to Scripture and did not favor any particular christian doctrine. They just kept it simply scripture.  Just the TRUTH.,1452384000,27,223,4.842105263157895
7463606,5,B01690GTKY,"How does one capture the soul of perfection and try to bring it to life through a film? This task is very daunting, to say the least. Either the character is greatly exaggerated or greatly understated. This is especially difficult when one tries to portray our Lord Jesus or His blessed Mother. Mel Gibson pulled it off seamlessly with the 'Passion of the Christ'. Full of Grace comes a close second, despite it being an indie film without the big bucks.
Bahia Haifi portrays the Virgin Mary with the dignity, solemnity, the quietness of soul and the deep sense of maternity that is associated with the Virgin Mary.
Unlike other films on Christ or the Virgin Mary, this movie primarily deals with the life of Mary and the burgeoning church after the Ressurection and Ascension of Our Lord. This is the gist of the film; one needs to watch it to be imbibed with the beauty, gravity, solemnity and the meditative atmosphere that permeates this wonderful production.
This film is breathtaking in its filming, and the musical score is reminiscent of the Passion of the Christ and has tracks composed by St. Hildegard of Bingen. Also some aspects of the film is taken from the Didache - the earliest Christian writings we have.
The discourse given by Mary in this movie speaks to every heart, at every age, in every generation.it is so masterfully executed that we experience the love and wisom of a mother - of the Holy Mother of God.
This film is extremely Christian; for Protestants, Orthodox and Catholics, alike.
It is not a tear jerker. However it will leave the viewer greatly edified. At a time when society has emotions and feelings rule the way one thinks or behaves, this film serves as a great antidote.
Special features included on this DVD is an interview with the actress who plays Mary and a film trailer.

The story of the end of her life, Peter's struggles with how to lead the church, all the remaining disciples coming to her.  Perfect.  The music and the setting, the entire aesthetic of the full composition, was very peaceful, beautiful, and 'full of grace'.  Like our Holy Mother, herself.",1515715200,,361,4.682539682539683

7463615,1,B01690GTKY,"I took a chance.  I should have listened to the one-star reviews.  It was very dark - filmed either in caves (or facsimiles of) or at night - with only 'candlelight' to show one side of the speaker's face partially.  The few daytime scenes were most all simple scenes in high grasses, so no expenses with cinematic effects.  The narration was brooding.  Mary dies in the film, no not biblically correct.  I can see the spectrum of reviews, and glad it worked for some people if thought provoking, but I guess I need something more upbeat and visual.  .",1511395200,3,552,4.515151515151516

7463622,3,B01690GTKY,"Good movie, but Mary was not buried. She went up directly to heaven. Otherwise, I like the message and she did help and influence the apostles a lot. She was the inspiration and spirit of the Church for a while. Jesus knew what he was doing when He chose a young mother who would be strong enough to nurture the Church until it grew stronger. The stones she collects remind me of rosary beads. Great story.",1505433600,2,406,4.355263157894737

7463630,5,B01690GTKY,"BEST MOVIE DEPICTION OF MOTHER MARY I HAVE EVER SEEN - this portrayal and The Passion of the Christ convey Her the best we  can, with our limitations.  So far, I have purchased 12 of these movies in about a month after first seeing it on Netflix on Holy Thursday.  I have given it as gifts and to share to Rosary Prayer Meetings, 12-Step meetings, RCIA, a monastery of religious friars, a couple other friends. I have joked that there are only 3 things I would have suggested be altered ""if I were on set and consulted...."" (lol. anyone who knows me, knows I always have something to say!)  1.) During a discussion with the Apostles/other brothers, Peter makes the comment along the lines of, ""Did our Lord care about Tradition and the Law? He showed us Love..."" or something like that.  Ah - YES, HE DID CARE!! While it is absolutely true that Jesus revealed the Face of the Father God Who IS LOVE, Jesus FULFILLED THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS IN LOVE.  This may seem a trivial point but in our culture of throwing away Tradition, Law, reductionist behavior, I don't consider it trivial at all.  Jesus clearly said, ""If you Love ME, you will KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS.""  We obey Him because we LOVE Him, not because of a ""rule"" but LOVE.....And He didn't have different Commandments, after all, His Father gave us the 10.  He summed them all up in Love:  ""LOVE GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, MIND, STRENGTH, SOUL, LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.""  IMHO - That is the most glaring Hiccup in the production. 2) The Movie is a couple scenes TOO SHORT - I wish the production included the ending of St. Thomas arriving 3 days after Her dormition to discover Her body gone... you can google catholic exchange movie review full of grace to read a wonderful article about the Traditions of Our Lady's Assumption, and  3) - and this is really my personal preference! - When M. Magdalene runs to Our Lady in a memory of the Resurrection, the look on Our Lady's face seemed to be one of ""Is it True? Did He rise?""  I would have directed a more Motherly look of ""I'm so GLAD you Saw HIM..."" a more Knowing Look!
What impressed me the Most about this movie is how PRAYERFUL, HOW SILENT -- in the midst of Dialogue! (AWESOME! I have Never Experienced this before in a MOVIE!!!! - Genius! Inspired!)-- HOW BEAUTIFULLY CONTEMPLATIVE the conversations are between Mother Mary and St. Peter! Truly - I could never say enough great good about this movie.  Thank you! THANK YOU ACTORS. THANK YOU DIRECTORS. THANK YOU CREW. THANK YOU PRODUCERS.  THANK YOU, MOST BEAUTIFUL FATHER GOD FOR YOUR GIFTS GIVEN TO THESE PEOPLE. I love you all and pray you continue your Anointed Holy Work.!

7463648,5,B01690GTKY,"Wonderfully movie.  I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this movie and the creative thought that went in to the development of it. It takes place ten years after The Resurrection.  The ""Church"" is not really formed yet.  The apostles/disciples turn to Mary for guidance and counsel, and receive it in quite remarkable ways.  This is not a hokey sappy tale, but a study and recognition of who Mary was....and why she is Full of Grace.

Nothing spectacular and you may not like it the first time you see it; but if you persevere and see it a second time and listen well to the spoken words and imagery you will want to see it again and again; the problems presented by Peter are still so true today; Blessed Virgin Mary speaks about faith and Peter leaves her home, renewed and resolute to carry on the task given to him by Jesus Christ.",1480377600,,425,4.132530120481928

I have to admit that I started watching the film with some trepidation. I hadn't seen it advertised anywhere and many Christian films are either pretty inaccurate or so poorly made they are painful to watch. As a faithful Catholic, I also had my guard up for misinformation and downplaying her role. I was very happy and surprised instead to see a beautiful film with a stunning sound track that left me in tears. This is honestly one of the best films I have seen. On the Full of Grace website, it describes the film as a ""cinematic prayer"" and I totally agree. I may be buying copies for all of my family members for Christmas.

Personally, the film was a reminder and a call to me to follow Him, to remember Him. I needed to hear that message today.",1475712000,,983,4.395604395604396

The dialog most often sounds like two bible scholars commenting on Scripture, rather than dramatic push-pull between characters in conflict. The action is so underplayed that one can lose track of just what the conflict is: some vague, unspecified conflict in the ""Church in Pontus"". But the plot never advances much along this line.

I thought the doctrinal points of the film excellent, and I wish the filmmakers would have made a documentary out of the footage.",1469145600,2,636,4.888888888888889

7463692,5,B01690GTKY,"I recently saw The Passion of The Christ for the first time last week, and I was looking for a worthy successor that film that continued the story with the same emotion. I foolishly bought ""RISEN"" because I had read reviews online claiming it to be a spiritual successor to the Passion even if not an official continuation or direct intention to be as such. The Passion and this movie are leagues apart both conceptually and spiritually. The Passion, while brutally visual, captured what few movies of this genre captured - an intimate and real love. It captured the intimate and deep love between Mother and Son, and all the suffering and sorrow that went with that love under the circumstances as well as the complete resignation to God's will out of that same love. It successfully captured a single Sacrifice offered two-fold in both the Son and His Mother who had to experience all of Christ's same suffering in Her heart while witnessing it brought upon the flesh of her flesh and bones of her bones. The Passion ended as well capturing a Mother's solemn heart-felt pain and resignation when Christ's corporal suffering finally ended and His body was brought down from His cross and laid in Her arms, although not quite as successful as Michelangelo's Pieta. ""RISEN"", on the other hand was a very superficial and liberal take on the Resurrection and the events that took place. RISEN did not capture any of the emotion found in The Passion. The joy of the Resurrection could not be any more shallow. I especially dislike how Christ is essentially portrayed to be walking off into the sunset followed by an atomic shoot into Heaven at the end instead of trying to portray a proper ascension. I seriously regret purchasing ""RISEN"". If you want something more of a spiritual sequel to The Passion, I recommend this movie ""Full of Grace"". This movie succeeds in capturing a similarly deep and intimate love and bond between Christ, His Mother, and the apostles as well as the early challenges of Christ's Church. The movie takes place after Christ's ascension so He is not really present physically, but He is successfully made present in the telling of the story.",1465776000,6,2166,4.794117647058823

7463724,1,B01690GTKY,"1.) In Mathew 16:18, Jesus stresses that He is identifying Peter as ""Peter"" and not the ""Rock"". Then Jesus says, ""And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."" Jesus is telling you that he will be crucified ""on this rock"" in order to save the sinners of the world. Not that any church will be built through Peter that even Hades will not overcome it. Think about where Jesus is standing when He says this. The key word is ""on this rock"", not through this rock as in stating Peter. It's really simple English. Shouldn't be hard to understand.
2.) In 43 AD, Mary would be at least 63 years old. That is if she had Jesus at 14 and Jesus being born in 6 AD. The actor in this movie doesn't even look at least 63 years old. I would say that Mary would have been about 65 to 67 years old in 43 AD.

It's a slow, gentle film appropriate for all ages, though young ones might get bored as there isn't much action; Mary and Peter are the primary characters.  The roles were well-cast and the performances were good.  It might even be good to play for a teen religious education class; lots of opportunities to pause and discuss the challenges that faced the early Church and Mary's role as a guide and intercessor then and always.

1. If you can take that its an Indie movie and the cinematography is not the best although some of the scenes are quite beautiful
2. You can follow along with a story line that is not historically accurate and you are not disturbed by the constant use of the same flashbacks through out the movie
3. Then there is something here that comes together at the end and is very touching and worth the time to watch, plus the acting is excellent. These are my reasons for the third star.

7463791,5,B01690GTKY,"The Movie is billed as the life of Mary after Christ's return; however, in my opinion, the most compelling character of the movie is Peter. I remember reading how the creators of the movie wanted to artistically create a piece of art that would speak to a person no matter where they were in their personal lives and perhaps this is why at this time Peter speaks to me. Peter's story opens up when he is speaking to other Christians who are spreading false teachings of Christ, Peter rebukes them asking whether they had witnessed these events like him. Of course, they say no, and they ask Peter to lead them. Peter throughout the movie seems reluctant to lead the Church because he feels inadequate to fill the shoes of Christ. He struggles with his purpose in God's plan. The movie also has a beautiful scene with Mary preparing to leave the earthly world speaking about her relationship with her son, The Christ and very much our (The movie viewers) relationship with him. It's not a typical 1st-century Christian movie, instead the art is not to illustrate the story of those people living, which it does, but it is also a piece of art that seeks to speak to all Christians on how to live their modern lives in Christ's image. The movie acknowledges that it will be a struggle, but it gives a peace of mind that it will be well worth it.",1453507200,54,1342,4.504098360655738

If you have read Catherine Emmerich's LotBVM, the Church Fathers or need to be spiritually recharged this is for you. +JMJ",1453507200,23,243,4.651162790697675

7463794,5,B01690GTKY,This is the best movie ever.  If you want a contemplative movie which can really reclarify your faith.  This is a must.  Mary's actress is so strong.  I heard her in an interview and she is true to the movie with her real life.  If anyone ones more information I would gladly oblige.,1453248000,3,283,4.264150943396227
7463795,5,B01690GTKY,Recently there've been three or four movies about the life of our Blessed mother. This one is superb.  The acting and the writing is excellent and in my mind's eye I felt that I was transported back 10 years after Christ's resurrection and ascension.  I felt like a witness to the dormition of our Blessed mother.,1453161600,4,313,4.571428571428571

The actress played a very good Mary.. would like to see her in a more true biblical role as Mary. the assumption of Mary was .. was assumed to be in the movie but I didn't catch it.",1452643200,5,591,4.042735042735043

8735863,3,B01690GTKY,I got this because it was done by the same team that did Paul: Apostle of Christ which I had just seen in the theater.  Paul would be 5 stars.  Full of Grace is barely 3.  It's respectful but really slow moving and is more about Peter's self-doubt than Mary.  It was filmed in suburban L.A. and looks it.  The acting is OK but many shots linger too long with sometimes mumbled dialogue.,1523318400,,386,4.232876712328767
