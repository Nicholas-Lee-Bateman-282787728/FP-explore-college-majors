8287192,5,B001CDFY4G,What a Fantastic Show!!! I love it!!! Kat and Friends are enjoyable to watch and learn. They are all very talented.,1241654400,3,115,4.523809523809524
8287193,5,B001CDFY4G,"I seem to enjoy Miami Ink a little better than LA, but as an artist in many mediums, I find these shows addictive as can be.  You see art going from idea to design and then application of the final piece, there are exchanges and confessionals from musicians, artists, and the talent of the artists between both programs is worth anyone's time.  Also a great value with hours of shows for not a lot of cash. Highly recommended!",1239321600,3,426,4.448717948717949
8287194,5,B001CDFY4G,"This is a great season... cant wait for the next one.
