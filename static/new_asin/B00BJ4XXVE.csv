The main character Pauline is a really weird and sexually disturbed teenager who we realize  is more disturbed than we thought, Traci Lords is the uptight but desperate to be good mother and the little sister Grace is ill with cystic fibrosis which when combined with big sister Paulines thirst for blood and the macabre turns the plot from twisted teen to full out crazy someone should have locked her up whack job. I really loved it.",1491004800,,669,4.439024390243903

Excision reminds you that horror neednt follow or be formulaic, it can re-present reality with a new distinguished voice, or even a scream. Excision stands alone in its newness, but can be said to be a kind of female Donnie Darko with lots of other references. As a genre it might be surrealism, dark satire and body horror.

The main character, Pauline, beautifully plays the role of a teenager, not fitting in with conventional suburban life. Normal and popular aren't Paulines concerns. Shes different from the beginning. Accepting her individuality she plays one of the strongest female roles for a long time and in doing so holds a blood-black mirror to what it means to be female. And before everyone gasps at this comment, Im not implying its the universal mother of all films. To play one unique female voice is enough.

The film doesnt rest alone on her shoulders. All the characters are good, including a few stars. There are so many vignettes; some comic, some gory. One for instance is between the mother and a deaf head mistress who hilariously says shes pleased not to be able to hear the dialogue between Pauline and her mother  its a very cutting scene about the vacuousness of surface beauty and mannerly behaviour. And that reflects the tone of a lot of the film  the lies on the surface and what lies beneath. Through Paulines head we see her control freak model of a mother, her easy going, but controlled father, the tragedy of her sisters condition, popular but insipid girls at school etc.

Throughout this film you wonder what it is about Pauline, you want to run a comb through her hair, but she won't be tamed, shes a surgeon in the making. She can be very cold, too intelligent (intelligence defeats itself at a certain point) and only rarely does she reveal any feelings as though she is aching to be something or anguishing under some weight. All this is just teen angst? Whatever it is it sneaks up on you and takes a big bite.

For those who say Excision doesnt have references, these are some I thought of: Inside, Repulsion, Carrie, Exorcist (vomit), Ginger Snaps. But, yes, Excision is clearly unique.",1477785600,,2203,4.723958333333333
8569376,4,B00BJ4XXVE,"There are some very creative and disturbing ideas in this pitch black horror comedy, with influences including Lynch, Cronenberg, Paul Bartel and John Waters.  But theres also sophomoric humor and on-the-nose and obvious supporting characters that keeps it from quite living up to its potential.

A bright and manipulative outsider/borderline crazy teen (an excellent AnnaLynne McCord) is obsessed with blood, surgery and sexuality (she asks her sex ed teacher can you get an STD from having sex with a corpse?).  She uses her superior intelligence to try and get what she wants from those in the stupid suburbia she finds herself stuck in.  But despite (or maybe because of) appearances by John Waters, Malcolm McDowell, Ray Wise, et al. reminding us of its better predecessors (e.g. Serial Mom, Twin Peaks, If, Clockwork Orange), it never quite reaches the kind of heights that it aspires to.

That said, you have to tip your hat to ambition, and where it works it's excellent. Very stylishly shot, and Im glad I saw it, even if I don't think Ill feel the need to see it again.",1451088000,,1079,4.8743169398907105
