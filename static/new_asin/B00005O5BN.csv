1638985,4,B00005O5BN,"I bought thing DVD, and much like the show, it is a quality piece of work. Subtitles and audio options up the yin-yang (Listen to Jackie in Chinese. It's the funniest. thing. ever.)
As for the show, its a stupendous piece of animation. Not that typical 'bug-eyed, sweat-drop, overly unrealistic haircut' of japanime, this stuff is targeted for western audiences and does its job- It sure pleased me. Its great for kids, since the violence is mild but even Jackie Chan standards and is more acrobatic that vicious. Get it, watch it, love it. Thats my suggestion",1005782400,8,560,4.783505154639175

7948294,1,B00005O5BN,"Man, I love this show. I haven't seen it in such a long time, but it's still up there in my five favorite cartoons of all time. Which is why I'm very upset with the manner in which these episodes were released on DVD. I mean, really. What IS this? Is it so much to ask for this show to be released by season as most shows are, with complete theme song and credits for each episode and no editing? Jeez. I realize it's neither the most brilliant nor the most popular television program ever conceived, but c'mon, DVD people, throw us JCA fans a bone here! Everyone else is doing it right. Surely a regular DVD release is not so much to ask?",1093564800,30,639,4.161290322580645
7948295,3,B00005O5BN,"Having taped Jackie Chan Adventures on both Kids WB! and Cartoon Network, and having recently purchased all three JCA DVDs used (never pay retail!) I can WITHOUT A DOUBT say that these episodes are intact AND that they are edited.
Wha?! You ask.
Depends on the episode. Some are completely intact. Some are missing from a few seconds to a few minutes. This has more to do with each DVD's combining three episodes into a ""movie"". While some complain that the intros are missings, this is not completely accurate as some are and some are not. Some actually have trimmed scenes... Where these DVDs really deviate is by playing one opening credit, all three episodes in ""movie format"", then all three ""Ask Jackie"" spots and finally a combined ending credits. Strangely, though they use the opening theme music during the end credits as adopted in later seasons NOT the ""Chan is the Man"" song originally used.
Why Columbia/Tri-Star (Sony distributes the show, but not the DVDs) chose to go with the ""movie format"" instead of just a straight-forward Episode 1, Episode 2, etc. and then stopped making the DVDs with Episode 9 is beyond me. I would like to see a Season One, Season Two, Season Three, and Season Four box set (especially since JCA has been picked up for a fifth season) with each episode being treated as an individual, hence my only giving these DVDs three stars each.",1083542400,31,1377,4.741666666666666
7948296,1,B00005O5BN,"I have loved this series since the beginning, and that is the problem.  I bought the DVD thinking that it would be a favorite show on an excellent format.  However, much to my chagrin, Sony decided to omit the first minute and a half of every episode.  Seems pretty stupid to me.",1082937600,10,279,4.326923076923077
7948297,3,B00005O5BN,"Here's the thing I want you to know . . . I enjoy the cartoon.  I think the series is pretty good.  It's good a pretty good basis for an ongoing story.  The characters and enjoyed - the heroes are likeable and the villains are believable.  However, Columbia/Tri-Star never finished putting out the series on DVD.  So, you'll never know how the series ends if you stick to picking it up on DVD.  Sure you can catch reruns on Fox and Cartoon Network, or figures out good triumphs over evil.  But, just wanted you to know . . .",1053043200,16,524,4.232323232323233
7948298,1,B00005O5BN,I am extremely disappointed they omitted the teasers. Leaving out the trailers really detracts from getting into the story. I expected better from a Sony product.,1019433600,6,162,5.269230769230769
7948299,5,B00005O5BN,Jackie Chan rocks in this addictive cartoon! Jade is funny as you know what. I love how the bad guys the darkhand are stupied. Shendu is very cool when he is no longer a piece of rock. This cartoon rocks!,1012262400,3,204,4.125
7948300,5,B00005O5BN,"In this cartoon Jackie Chan must collect Talismans; all have different powers and get Jackie and his cartoon niece Jade and Grandfather into some wild perdicaments. Jackie and the crew need to figure out what powers the Talisman holds and locate it before the villans reach the Talisman's first.
I enjoy this cartoon because not only does it contain Jackie Chan but it also has a neat story line to follow and is quite entertaining. It is action packed without being as violent looking as some of Jackie Chan's real live movies.
I would recommend this cartoon for Jackie Chan fans. Even the adult ones.
It is worth the time and money.",1005782400,8,634,4.669642857142857
