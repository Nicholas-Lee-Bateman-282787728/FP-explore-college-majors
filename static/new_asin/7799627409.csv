8014954,4,7799627409,"Seoul Searching begins with the introduction of the characters who have come to Korea  to learn about the Korean culture. The film opens with
what seemed to be stereotypical teenagers.  I came very close to turning off the film. However,  I am very glad I did not turn it off because
the film is both entertaining and educational.  It begins by showing the many issues that these Korean girls and boys have all struggled with as they continue to grow through their teen age years as citizens of many different countries around the world.  These teenagers have come to a summer camp in South Korea that exposes them to an overview of various aspects of Korean culture.  But perhaps even more importantly they see how others like themselves have developed survival techniques in their adopted countries.  We  come to appreciate  how hard these Korean teens have worked to survive,  be productive,  and become good citizens in their adopted countries.",1513987200,,948,4.89937106918239

There were so many things I enjoyed: the character development, the 80's backdrop, the education about a cultural program I'd never know about, and the homage to Huston (director of The Breakfast Club and other 80's classics).  The movie showed great diversity within the Korean community while taking the audience on an entertaining ride that ranged from the slapstick ridiculous to heart-breaking sadness to the hysterical situations of the awkward teenage years. The social topics the movie covered were many, but still well-developed.  Although, the attempted sexual assault scene was acknowledged for being wrong and the perpetrator claimed wrong doing to another male, which is more than is usually done in films, he did not own it or apologize to the girl he attacked and that was an opportunity lost.  Overall, the directing was masterful in my opinion even when some dialogue/situations might have left something to be desired.  Still, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much and been run through the full gamut of emotions in a single film in a very long time. I laughed so hard in some places and sobbed to the point of embarrassment in others. Crawford has surpassed Huston's ""Breakfast Club"" with ""Seoul Searching"", in my opinion, because of the depth of the characters, although, Crawford did have more than a 12 hr time period to cover his subjects. My biggest disappointment is that I can't purchase it for my home collection.  When will this movie get distribution?!",1449705600,,1565,4.977011494252873
