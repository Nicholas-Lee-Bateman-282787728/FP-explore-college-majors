It ignores important facts on record,  does not ask hard questions and it does not offer a real apology.  The real question of whether we are responsible for our actions and their consequences remains.

This video, for the first time for me, shows what really happened from the people who were there and played the real roles they believed they were playing. Not the myths that the Israeli establishment propagated, not the hot-headed comments from the people on the beach, on the street, or at the bar, but the real story.
