8105129,3,B000E371PK,"This video takes a look at science fiction from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and Edgar Allen Poe to more contemporary times.  One question is can this be done effectively in the 90 or so minutes of this video, without merely scratching the surface.  This video probably does as well as can be expected.

It gives the impression that this was originally created as a two hour segment on the History Channel, who is responsible for this.  There are no clearly obvious commercial breaks, but there are segments that seem to go back and give a slight review, which would be more appropriate if there were commercial interruptions.  I will praise the editing to keep those commercial breaks from being obvious.

One might be surprised that ""Frankenstein"" and Poe were considered science fiction.  The video points out that Shelly's story did deal with a scientific hypothesis of using electric currents to create movement in cadavers (animals in practice).  Additionally, in previous stories it was religious figures and magicians and gods that were responsible; this was the introduction of the mad scientist.  Furthermore, it dealt with a common science fiction theme of man entering too far into God's domain.

It did a good job touching on the highlights of science fiction history, from writing (e.g. Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, and the pulps), to movies (e.g. the Flash Gordon serials, Godzilla, 2001:  A Space Oddessey, and Star Wars), to radio and television (e.g. Orson Wells' ""War Of The Worlds"", ""The Twilight Zone"", and ""Star Trek"").  However, the time constraints kept it from doing more to hit the highlights.  There was nothing more than a couple quick shots from the movie ""Fantastic Voyage"", and while it mentioned biological experiments, it didn't mention a perfect illustration of this theme, ""Jurassic Park"".

Likewise, it touches on certain themes of science fiction (such as if ""Star Wars"" is science fiction), but that's all it does.  I will be honest and admit this is the history channel, not another network fit more for the philosophical, but I would have loved a more philosophical look.  Just my opinion.

If you want a history of science fiction, this is an excellent choice.  If you want something to relax to as you waste an hour and a half, this would fit the bill as well.",1168128000,5,2311,4.94300518134715
