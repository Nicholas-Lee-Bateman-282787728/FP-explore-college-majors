8258781,5,B000ER3OP2,"Fat Pizza is a politically incorrect absolutelly hilarous slice of modern day Australian humour.  It is quite foreign to the American style but then so was Benny Hill and Monty Python in days gone by.  If you can drag your prejudices past seemingly broad jokes it is full of life and joy and wit.  It is destined to sink like a stone as a fish out of water - but its well worth a look if you have an open mind, a sense of curiousity, an innocent sense of humour, and a spare slice of cash.",1143331200,2,489,4.072916666666667
