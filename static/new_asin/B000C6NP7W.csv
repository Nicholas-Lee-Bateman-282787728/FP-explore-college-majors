8096106,5,B000C6NP7W,"Yes, the information about this film is misleading.  They're wrong.  I ordered this because I saw Tamura Masakazu's name on it.  It turned out to be the wrong film.  But to my surprise, it's very enjoyable.  After I watched the Grudge Song (the actual one with Tamura), I found Beast Stable to be better!  The shock elements are there and they're actually visually well-made.  (But be ready to see blood and gruesome acts.) One tends to sympathize with Sasori in this film cos she's trying so hard to live a normal, peaceful life, but the evil policemen just wouldn't leave her alone.  The small details are also thoughtfully-made and entertaining.  Cool stuff!",1163030400,2,661,4.830357142857143
8096107,5,B000C6NP7W,"I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song}) for some time.  I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series.  After just watching this film, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three.

All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito.  What is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are each vastly different from the others.

The first movie (Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie.  But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns.  And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material.

The second movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour-de-force.  Not so much a WIP movie as the bulk of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam.

This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito.  This one plays out as much more of a crime drama.  Once again, our heroine is on the run.  But this time out, she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway).  She gets a job, she finds a place to live, she makes a friend on the outside.  But, of course, everything has to unravel eventually.  FPS: Beast Stable has a more straight-forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors.  But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end.  And don't worry:  there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie!  But I think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in-your-face shock value.  Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed mightily.  But I didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story (well, maybe a time or two).

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary films.  FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (as can the first two movies) but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so.",1146700800,11,2374,4.7201946472019465
