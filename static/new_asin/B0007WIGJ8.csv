8052860,5,B0007WIGJ8,This was awesome. Recommended for any collector. If you got the diesel in the blood you must have this it is also great quality.,1402704000,,128,4.375
8052861,3,B0007WIGJ8,"I prefer historical footage of trains doing what they were designed to do.  ""When Giants Roamed"" from the History Channel is more to my liking.  Pretty pictures of fan trips on restored trains are not things I will watch over and over.  It's rather like watching a ride at Disney World over and over.  Unless you are actually on the ride it gets boring quickly.",1367366400,,361,4.507692307692308
8052862,4,B0007WIGJ8,"GIFT GIVER:  A great way to give the train lover you know the sight of something new and different. Age doesn't matter if knowledge of trains is what you are looking for.

GIFT RECEIVER:  The four volume set completed the series ""America by Rail.""  Four additional DVDs were included in the two volumes which added a different look to railroads and sortline trains operating in our country.  I'm pleased with all 8 DVDs.",1294617600,,420,4.698630136986301
8052863,5,B0007WIGJ8,"My father loves trains.  Unfortunately, he had a stroke last year and is still recouping.  During this time he has had a terrible time sleeping and has developed a fear of the bed so he stays in a recliner.  I bought these DVDs for him as a Christmas gift and he seems to really enjoy them.  I guess he finds some sort of comfort in watching them and hearing the trains and it seems to relax him and help him sleep.  I do agree with one reviewer - there could be less narration but anything that comforts my dad and helps him sleep is worth its weight in gold.",1262822400,,560,4.10091743119266
8052864,4,B0007WIGJ8,these are really cool movies.  My kids will sit for hours watching them.  If you like trains you should enjoy these.,1256169600,,116,4.476190476190476
8052865,5,B0007WIGJ8,We received this item in perfect condition; we are saving it for a Christmas present.,1226793600,,85,4.733333333333333
8052866,1,B0007WIGJ8,"I was disappointed in this train series.  I purchased it for my grandson, who loves train visuals.  This is a narrative format, which bores him.",1183507200,4,144,4.72
8052867,5,B0007WIGJ8,"my 3 1/2 yr old son saw these videos at his Pops house and fell in love with them.  He is obsessed with trains and watches these fabulous, real live footage of trains traveling the country.  The scenery is beautiful and he is learning a lot.  Will definetly purchase more train videos in the future!",1171411200,9,299,4.4
8052868,5,B0007WIGJ8,"well you could have a video of a fishtank on your screen for background noise or you could watch a nice cross country trip on some of americas forgotten tracks.

My interest in this is purely aestheic - I don't really care about train models or stats... what I like is the beauty of the land - though sometimes they could have cleaned windshields.

I love how ugly the east is though - Most of where the main travel video goes is from washington out to ohio through what is best described as the buttcrack of the country.

It doesn't really get pretty till the mountains of virginia.

Still, seeing the decay and mess that is the back of industrial america can give some pause.

Man's hands on the nation as Plowden once showed  is remarkable.

good for insomnia.",1140134400,5,763,4.446043165467626
