8302549,2,B001FSBGR2,"I guess if you know absolutely nothing about a bass (which is actually stated in the title of the DVD) you will find this helpful. It goes through things like tuning and a basic scale, an arpeggio and a minor arpeggio. As far as actually playing the bass, like maybe a song, or musical theory, this isn't going to help. I like looking at instructional dvd's of all levels thinking I can usually get something of use out of anything, but this didn't give me anything. I would say I am somewhere between a beginner and intermediate level player to give a point of reference.  Glad I got this from the local library and didn't buy it.",1483142400,,631,4.3931623931623935
8302550,1,B001FSBGR2,"If you're looking for a dvd that will help you to start playing music, give this one a skip. You will hear an unconvincing history of the bass, you will learn how to hold the instrument - described twice. You will learn some finger exercises, the major scale, and two arpeggios, but there is no description of just how these principles are applied to real music, and Phil goes on about how he's saving you time, but his explanation of how he does this is very flimsy. At the end of the dvd, you will not be able to play anything vaguely resembling music, so I'd recommend finding something else to get you playing the instrument. I know I will.",1302566400,4,644,4.375
