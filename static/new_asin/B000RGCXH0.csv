8200544,5,B000RGCXH0,"Exciting footage of steam engines across the nation! It even includes some of my favorite locomotives, such as the Norfolk and Western 1218 and 611, Southern Pacific Daylight 4449, along with Union Pacific's huge Big Boys and Challenger 3985. This is 1 train DVD that any fan of steam wouldn't mind adding to their collection.",1491523200,,326,4.945454545454545
8200545,5,B000RGCXH0,"If you like monstrous steam locomotives and the America that they prowled (still prowl), you'll love this DVD. The cinematography is crisp, powerful and inspiring. The narration is Pentrex - informative and pulls you into the scene and the action. Get this DVD!",1384732800,,261,5.093023255813954
