3875378,4,B0028YW36K,"This is one of those films where the countryside locations almost outweigh the film itself. And even though this was made 15 films ago for Donal Logue, this showed he has some love story chops.

The story follows a washed up alcoholic director being given a last chance to direct a small fishing show in Scotland. Along the way we watch him learn about his dysfunctions, finding love, being able to work again, and most of all see him finding the fish (you will understand that if you watch it). The performances were solid, especially from Tom Conti and that voice of his. I did not like the editing style (some of the split screen scene changes similar to the Odd Couple TV show) nor the intermittent Lifetime schmaltz once in awhile, but overall the scenery and impending love story make for a fun watch. The music score was standard, but they slipped in a not too often heard Phil Collins vocal piece for the end scenes.

The picture is good, the sound is average and sometimes off, and the supplements are decent. The main featurette lasts 12 minutes and has most of the standard everyone is awesome cuts, but a few nice tidbits. The deleted scenes last 14 minutes and had some unique footage, especially the opening scene that was removed (I had been able to play the whole film in the store and was not aware these scenes would be NC17ish - oops). A trailer and commentary are also included, I was mostly listening for where they filmed - awesome locations.

A decent watch overall for a Scottish locale love story. Would be rated a weak R for sexual situations, language and brief nudity - deleted scenes included would give it a solid R. Enjoy.",1249776000,8,1653,4.558922558922559

8357219,5,B0028YW36K,I loved it! Donal Logue is an excellent actor and grows better every year. The cast was amazing as was the story. You will laugh til you can't breathe and weep a lot too. I'm ordering more copies. I'm sure I will wear this one out!,1434758400,,231,4.043478260869565

8357222,4,B0028YW36K,"This movie is about an alcoholic TV producer who gets sent to Scotland to produce a TV show starring his ex-wife. The guy is a likable character and you find yourself cheering for him to finally give up the booze, but it seems like he continually slips back into drinking. When he gets to Scotland, his show sort of bogs down because they can't catch any fish which is what the show is supposed to be about. There are a number of interesting characters in the movie and they seem to have a decent deal of chemistry as they interact. There's nothing tacky in the movie, but there are also few innovative or interesting twists. In the end, the movie is a lukewarm feel-good love story when the main character befriends and falls in love with a local female fishing guide who is a single mother. This is a serviceable low-budget romantic comedy but it isn't terribly memorable. I think a little less focus on drinking problems and a little more development in the love story would have made this movie a bit better, but it's still work a look.",1383350400,,1040,4.478947368421053
8357223,4,B0028YW36K,"This movie has a similar feel to the Tao of Steve, but is more grown up.  I quite enjoyed it and have watched it several times now.  It's an unlikely story, but all the more real for it.  Unlike most romances, this one feels authentic.",1353196800,,235,4.177777777777778
8357224,5,B0028YW36K,This was a good movie i think you would enjoy it if your into romance it'll bring a felling over you like I need to call my lady and ask her out.,1323302400,,145,3.5625
