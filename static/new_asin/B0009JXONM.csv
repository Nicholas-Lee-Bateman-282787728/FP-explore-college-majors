8062199,5,B0009JXONM,"The film 'Night before Christmas' is based on a short story from Nikolai Gogol's work 'Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka'. The story opens with a stunning winter scenery of Dikanka, Ukraine with a witch flying across the night sky and the devil roaming around and tormenting people. Meanwhile, the simple village blacksmith, Vakula is pining away for a dazzlingly beautiful village lass, Oksana. With a caprice that matches her beauty, she teases him to bring her the Tsaritsa's slippers. In his love for Oksana, the blacksmith really sets out for St. Petersburg to ask Queen Catherine the Great for her slippers. 'Night before Christmas' is a love story that is charming in its simplicity.",1376265600,,688,4.991304347826087

I watch it in Russian only with no subtitles, so there were no problems. It is a favorite in my library of Russian movies.",1359072000,2,257,4.26530612244898
8062201,5,B0009JXONM,"Yes, sometimes it was hard to pay attention to the English translation, but I'm so glad we bought it. My kids who don't speak Russian that much loved the story and could follow it using both languages. What can ever beat a witch on the broom stealing stars from the night sky????? My daughter wants to be SOLOHA next Halloween!!!",1355443200,,329,4.5
8062202,4,B0009JXONM,"This is a wonderful movie.  I love Russian films from the mid Soviet period, and this is an excellent one.  Great for the technology that was available to them.

Anyone who is a student of a Slavic language or looking to delve deeper into their Slavic American heritage will enjoy watching this around the holidays.

One thing that prevented me from giving this film the extra * was the English dubbing.  I understand most of what they say, and if I don't, I make do with subtitles.  A friend insisted on watching the English language version on this disk, and I was very disappointed by the poor quality voice-overs.  They don't mute the original Russian speach, but play the English right along with it.  In short, it makes it so you can't make out either language, as their playing at the same time.

If you could do without hearing it in English, this is a 100% top notch film the whole family will enjoy for years.",1324771200,2,919,4.4879518072289155
8062203,5,B0009JXONM,"Quite surprised with this obscure Russian Christmas/Fairy tale which features a witch and the devil causing mayhem during the holiday season. The witch captures stars from the night sky and the devil has it in for the local blacksmith who has painted a rather insulting image of the devil being made to look ludicrous by the church. In order to gain approval and win in hand the young maiden, the blacksmith must procure a pair of royal slippers/shoes to present to his beloved, who appears a bit standoff-ish if you ask me!
All in all, a whimsical Christmas (in color) fairy tale for the entire family to enjoy...odd and enjoyable, strange yet familiar. Recommended.",1248480000,10,667,4.859649122807017
