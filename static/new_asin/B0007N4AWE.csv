2222618,5,B0007N4AWE,"This is a great series that originally aired on the BBC and also played on the Food Network. I saw it when it aired on the Food Network and I was so happy to see that it was coming to DVD. It's a great show that really gives you an inside look at what it takes to get a resturaunt off the ground. As if that wasn't hard enough, to do it with 15 untrained people who have a passion for cooking but no official experience is just a daunting task.

You'll see the frustration, and the aggrivation when things go wrong. As well as the jubilation when everything is going right, which is rarely the case it seems. Jamie is great at letting the camera see exactly whats going on in his mind. He rarely holds back and always speaks his mind when things aren't going his way.

In the end it's really a great look into how people cope with being put into situations they aren't used to and how far people will go when they are passionate about something. I highly reccomend this DVD to any fan of Jamie Oliver or any person thinking about getting into the resturaunt business. It's extremely entertaining and you won't be disappointed at all.",1115078400,15,1133,4.314553990610329
2222639,4,B0007N4AWE,"I am a huge Jamie Oliver fan.  He is my favorite chef and I truley enjoy his gift in cooking.

I was dissapointed that his reality series had a lot of foul language, so we chose to return this particular DVD, but his new cookbook and new cooking show are ""fantastic"" as he might say.",1203638400,2,283,4.127272727272727
2222640,5,B0007N4AWE,"This DVD surprised me.  I originally purchased it for my daughter who is a huge fan of Jamie. I thought it would be on the ""fluffy cook"" side, but was I wrong.  We watched the DVD together over Christmas holiday, and as someone who is working on a plan to start a rural kitchen incubator, the trials and tribulations of starting Jamie's Kitchen were a good reality check for me as I work through my own planning.  I found myself rooting for the kids to make it through Jamie's ""Fifteen"" program, and I was very interested in the way Jamie handled the young people while tweaking the ""Fifteen"" program AND getting the nuts and bolts of the restaurant together. What an amazing accomplishment!  I have watched the DVD in its entirety 4 times since Christmas, and I am not tired of it yet.  I would reccommend this DVD as a reference to anyone who is thinking about starting their own restaurant or commercial kitchen, or who is thinking about becoming a chef.",1199664000,3,957,4.540697674418604
2222641,5,B0007N4AWE,Excellent product. Just what I expected and more. I cant wait for Jamies next videos.,1199145600,,85,4.733333333333333
2222642,5,B0007N4AWE,"A wonderful DVD that shows the challenges one can face with the best of ideas.  Jamie Oliver is a hero for doing what few entrepreneurs even try to do... establish a thriving business while making a difference in the lives of young people who are unemployed and out of school -- by helping them to become chefs -- often despite themselves.  Jaime does this by putting his home and reputation on the line, and by sticking by his ""15"" even when they fail to fully appreciate the wonderful opportunity that they have been offered.  The journey they all travel together is funny, touching, depressing, and real.  Bravo Jamie.",1174435200,2,621,4.722222222222222
2222643,5,B0007N4AWE,"It was quite refreshing to see Jamie in real day-to-day stuff, even managing to burn his own breakfast!  I've loved his previous dvds which are all about having a good  time.  Here, he's to be applauded for embarking on the monumental task of taking kids off the street and eventually turning them (some) into real chefs.  The patience he shows some of the kids, who time after time start to throw away this chance, is remarkable. But he does get mad. He does grow impatient, as do his old teachers and mentors.  He's got a lot riding on the line; his own money and his reputation.  But he never really makes it about him.  He genuinely cares about these kids. And inspite of his success and wealth, he seems to be the same old Jamie ever ready with a laugh.  It's also fascinating watching the students. Some grow and mature into their new role; something they knew nothing about the year before.  Others fall by the wayside and we know, as viewers, they'll one day look back on this opportunity and reget having made excuses to walk away.

It's a heartfelt program and one I wish would continue being filmed . I'd love to see his next class and ride along on their journey as they make their way.",1156896000,5,1198,4.429223744292237
2222644,5,B0007N4AWE,"A great reality show, following a group of working class youths in England getting the chance to become cooks in a top UK restaurant for free.  It's highly entertaining and well worth the price.  We caught this show when we were visiting Australia and got hooked.  Also check out Jamie's School Dinners series, available on Amazon UK.",1149292800,5,334,4.824561403508772
2222645,2,B0007N4AWE,"If you like reality TV or soap operas, this DVD is right up your alley. Jamie is indeed informative and amusing during his cooking shows. I guess I expected something like that from this DVD.",1136678400,2,191,4.485714285714286
2222646,5,B0007N4AWE,"This is an amazing DVD to buy for anyone interested in cooking or, especially, owning thier own restaurant (and face it---how many people do you know that say, ""some day, I'd love to have my own little cafe..."").  This is one of the best shows I've ever seen---It's a cross between a soap opera, cooking show and reality show.  Once you start watching it, you'll be hooked.

Basically, Jamie Oliver (the ""Naked Chef"" for those of you not obsessed with the Food Network) takes a bunch of kids who are unemployed and completely unskilled (at least in the kitchen) and turns them into chefs.  Along the way, you get a glimpse into what it's like to be a celebrity chef, the pressures of opening a new restaurant (HELLO??? how can ANYone afford such a venture?) and how frustrating a project of this scope must be (especially when your every move is being watched by the cameras).  It's fascinating to watch the transformation of these kids (actually, they're in their early 20's, I think).

To me, this is just another example of how great British TV has become -- I highly recommend this DVD.",1117497600,20,1090,4.6217616580310885
2222647,5,B0007N4AWE,"My wife bought this and we watched it over the weekend, and I was looking here to see what other people thought of it and I can't believe no one has said how funny Jamie is. When he's not being ravaged with business decisions and dealing with personal issues, Jamie seems like a great down to earth guy. He had me cracking up quite a few times. I wasn't sure if I'd like this show as I had only seen his Naked Chef show a few times and I wasn't that excited about it. But this was great. I can't believe his resturaunt ever opened with these kids. They start out not knowing anything he turns them into hard working chefs. It's really amazing.

I don't know what to compare this show to but it's a reality series thats for sure. But not like other ones you've seen really. It's a lot more personal than other shows like it I think. I had a great time watching it and I think you will too.",1116892800,8,888,4.103448275862069
2222648,5,B0007N4AWE,"He may have, but that's half the fun of watching this series..

I wanted to write a review about this because I really loved the series. I'm hoping that he actually does the whole thing again. It was really exciting, and interesting to see a side of Jamie Oliver that you really never get to see on his cooking shows, even though those are based on a ""reality"". This is Jamie Oliver RAW. You see him out of the kitchen, dealing with the stresses of starting his resturaunt, the stresses of his gf's pregnacy, the finances, dealing with 15 kids who have never worked in a kitchen before. It's amazing the whole thing did not come falling down on him.

If you have seen Olivers Twist, or The Naked chef and enjoyed those shows then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It's not a cooking show, it's a reality show, but it's very worth the purchase. I can't wait to see the whole thing over again!",1115596800,10,903,4.305882352941176
8049215,5,B0007N4AWE,Was a Christmas gift - went over well for that hard to buy for person. Easy to follow recipes for that culinary person.,1438473600,,119,4.217391304347826
8049216,3,B0007N4AWE,"I am giving this three stars due to the foul language throughout this series.  It is very coarse and raw.  If it weren't for that I would give it four or five stars.  It is a fascinating look at the development of a real chef and shows the reality of the hard work involved.  It is also nice to see Jamie Oliver in real life situations.  It just would have been better if they had censured it a bit.  Also, the show emphasizes the students that have a hard time or are trouble-makers, and I would have liked to have seen more of the work of the high achivers as well.  Still, we watched it all but it is not a ""keeper"" for us.  Jamie has produced other DVDs that are much better.",1407369600,,679,4.052631578947368
8049217,5,B0007N4AWE,This series takes you through the heartache and turmoil as well as the joys and success that was Jamies Kitchen/Jamies Fifteen,1393891200,,126,5.0476190476190474
8049218,5,B0007N4AWE,If you like reality cooking shows this is a good one! You also get a glimpse of what Jamie's life is like.,1376956800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8049219,5,B0007N4AWE,"I ordered this DVD last week, and received it in the mail today. I sat down to watch one episode, and found myself totally entranced. I watched the entire series in one sitting!!  I can honestly say that seeing Jamie's commitment to those students, and the risks he takes for his belief in them is totally amazing.  I found myself completely connected to the kids through every failure and triumph.  As a future culinary arts student (start classes in January!!!), I can say that getting a glimpse into actual restaurant kitchens and the lives of those students has giving me more drive and determination to be successful. I would highly recommend this series!",1350604800,,660,4.823008849557522
8049220,4,B0007N4AWE,"First off, if you've ever watched ""Oliver's Twist,"" or ""Food Revolution,"" you may think you have a bit of an idea of what to expect.  You really don't.  What was a bit shocking at first was the prolific swearing coming out of Jamie's mouth.  The show starts with Jamie dropping the F-bomb shortly after the camera starts rolling, and this sets the tone for the whole show.  He basically doesn't stop after that.  This was a bit off-putting for me, but the rest of the series is actually pretty interesting.

What I loved is that it lacks the ""scripted"" feel that ""reality"" TV has today.  It felt very genuine and real.  Messy.  Disorganized.  But real.  It's not a perfect show, but I think it really delivers on its premise.  Give it a watch if you want something a bit more gritty than your usual reality TV fare, and are looking to know what a real kitchen is actually about.",1339200000,,878,4.452830188679245
8049221,5,B0007N4AWE,"The premise of this show is intriguing so I gave it a try. So fascinating I just watched the entire thing at once. I was supposed to be cleaning and now it's 10:15 at night and my place is still messy, haha. It's nice to see someone trying although frustrating to see people given opportunities and then not able to follow through.",1278633600,,331,4.354838709677419
8049222,5,B0007N4AWE,We love Jamie Oliver! These DVDs are great. Very well done. I wish he had more stuff available in US format.,1262822400,,108,4.190476190476191
8049223,5,B0007N4AWE,"I rented this DVD from the library and later-on had to buy it. The man is a dynamo; a great humanitarian. It's proof-positive that one person can indeed make a difference in the lives of others. The rise of his idea and plans for the restaurant and the subequent (sp?) choice of students and the amazing gigs he gets these kids; how he takes them from star-struck to truly trained chefs is incredible. And Jamie, as you'd expect, is both caring and focused, tough eventually (they are basically teens and young adults who get an opportunity so huge that it really doesn't dawn on the majority of them who think these kind of chances will come along every day - like we all do when we are young) but mostly he's just a brilliant, non-stop, take-no for an answer entrepreneur as always forcing his visions into reality. It's quite the gripping 'documentary'; it's amazing to me how much he gets done and how much you end up rooting for Jamie to get this endevor off the ground. He, of course, does, but how he does it is a journey deservedly filmed and shared. That cover with him looking like he's going to lose it if one more thing goes wrong? It's a miracle he didn't - and then have a nervous breakdown. Great DVD about the restaurant/cooking lifestyle and pulling off the ultimate culinary philantrophic feat.",1260489600,,1312,4.563559322033898
8049224,5,B0007N4AWE,I thoroughly enjoy this DVD and feel Jamie Oliver's pain trying to improve the lives of these rather irascible teenagers.,1239753600,,121,5.1
