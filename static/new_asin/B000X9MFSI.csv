8316591,4,B000X9MFSI,"I don't know how they do it, but the Best Motoring team keeps making their DVDs both fun and interesting.  I enjoyed this one as much as all the others I have.  Again, I found myself wishing there were an American equivalent to this series.  They drive cars striaght from the showroom, tuner cars and racing cars... and they have a great time trying to beat each other.  That's what makes these DVDs so entertaining to me.",1270339200,,422,4.441558441558442
8316592,4,B000X9MFSI,"I make it short but to the point.
- New Civic Type R test was good includes 0-300m test (not 400m test)& track battle.
- The Touge 300 was very good. Like usual Tsuchiya really push the sport cars to the limit at a narrow mountain side road. Very Crazy! you will love it.
- F599 review was not complete yet. No Track Battle, just driving feels compare to Gallardo with 520hp.
- Battle between Japan Drifter & US Drifter in US was fun too.

If you like Car Video, this DVD is recommended. More Hardcore test drive than Top Gear.",1199318400,,527,4.217821782178218
