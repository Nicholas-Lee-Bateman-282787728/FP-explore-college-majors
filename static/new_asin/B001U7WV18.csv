When I hit 'play program' I expect it to play THROUGH, not just one of the sections.",1392336000,,241,4.148936170212766
8343114,1,B001U7WV18,"I ordered this video for my four year old son who we believe might be autistic. First of all, the video is all of 15 minutes. Within the first two minutes, it has a group of children fighting and calling each other ""stupid."" Personally, we don't use words like stupid in our home, especially with a four year old. Second, it has a girl explaining that when you get angry, you should breath deeply and count to ten. Duh! We have certainly tried that route, so hearing it from some girl was not intriguing in any way. Not only was he immediately bored, I was as well. This video is poorly made and a waste of money. Wishing there was less than a one star rating.",1314576000,,660,4.246031746031746
