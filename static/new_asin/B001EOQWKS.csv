3556577,4,B001EOQWKS,"""Csak szex s ms semmi"" (""Just Sex and Nothing Else"") is a romantic comedy from Hungary, where it is reported the film became a huge hit in 2006. If you see the film, you will not be surprised.

After her disastrous relationship with a lawyer and very embarrassing incident on the balcony, a 32-year-old single woman Dra (Judit Schell) meets a handsome actor Tamas (Sandor Csanyi of ""Kontroll""). She takes an instant dislike to Tamas, a playboy who happens to be the star of the local stage ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (he is to play Valmont). Coincidentally Dra, a dramaturge, has been working on the script for the very production he is in. This means, like it or not, they have to meet each other.

Tamas is not a bad guy, as it turns out, but what Dra really wants is a baby, not a guy (hence the film's provocative title). Well, that is what Dra says anyway, being totally fed up with males. Things become complicated when she meets a kind and timid pianist / composer Pter (Zoltn Seress) who is attracted to her.

Krisztina Goda's film starts off with slick storytelling, using several set-pieces effectively to introduce the main and supporting characters including Dra's best friend Zsfi (Kata Dob). The story itself is predictable, and some of the episodes look very familiar with the likable heroine doing things at wrong time and wrong place (like, say, Bridget Jones), but the film, bolstered by the excellent acting of the entire cast, makes for enjoyable viewing, and would make you smile and giggle many times.

Probably the most notable thing about ""Just Sex and Nothing Else"" is that despite the film's potentially serious topics, the film remains charming throughout (it even has bloopers at the end credit). With a less skillful director the heroine Dra would have looked selfish or childish, alienating most of the audiences. Fortunately this doesn't happen here, thanks to the film's snappy pace and able cast. Not exactly the greatest romantic comedy, but the film is still funny and pleasant.",1245456000,11,2007,4.859649122807017
3556578,5,B001EOQWKS,"I've been waiting for this DVD after seeing this at a film festival.  Attractive 33-year old Dora works with the local theater group as a playwright/translator, but seems to have nothing but problems with the men in her life.  With her biological clock ticking, she would like a baby without the hassle of a husband, so she places a personals ad requesting ""just sex and nothing else.""  The plot gets complicated with the men who respond to her ad as well as the unwanted attentions of Tamas, the handsome actor at the theater where she works.  Memorable scenes include her getting stuck, nearly naked, on a balcony after her (unbeknownst to her) married lover's wife shows up!

A fresh and witty take on romance, this excellent screwball comedy has an attractive cast, clever dialogue, and is set in beautiful Budapest! Note of caution, this DVD release is not of the best quality, so it somewhat diminishes the experience, but I still recommend this for a very enjoyable romantic comedy.",1220140800,11,989,4.828402366863905
