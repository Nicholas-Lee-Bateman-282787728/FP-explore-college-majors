1854171,2,B00008NJFT,"This was an amusing movie, but the language is 100% gutter.  Rounded down from 2.5 stars to 2 stars for language.  I Acutally liked Analyze That a little better than Analyze This.  but now that I've seen them once, I see no need to see them again.",1057190400,2,247,4.212765957446808
1854172,5,B00008NJFT,"""You, you're good, you."" Yes! Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is brilliant as the mobster who cries and gives no mercy to his enemies. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) becomes his shrink after one threat and there goes on! ""Analyze This"" is funny with Sobel trying to get married, but Vitti interrupts his life and shoots pillows for no reason. ""Analyze That"" is funnier with hilarious parts including the woman and the midget picture, the tuna casserole, and the ""West Side Story"" sing-a-longs. Momentous! These are two funny movies that people need to see.",1054166400,3,547,4.89247311827957

1854187,5,B00008NJFT,"Billy Crystal and Rober Di Niro are so incredibly funny together. The plots (especially in Analyze That) are a bit thin and you so of have to suspend any grasp on reality to buy the premise, but once you do, these are very funny movies. My favorite scene in the sequel is Di Niro working as a car salesman--the scene is way too short, I would pay to see him in an entire movie in that character. Great films, worth the money, they never grow old.",1463097600,,446,4.1976744186046515

Lisa Kudrow is boring and you can't tell much of a difference in her performance than those on Friends. Where is originality Lisa? Otherwise I liked both movies very much.

1854314,5,B00008NJFT,"This is the only way to buy either of these movies.  One without the other just wouldn't do.  My wife and I had seen both of these, and watching them again was a great treat.  You expect Billy Crystal to be funny, but Deniro is just absolutely hilarious.  they play off each other perfectly - the chemistry is fantastic.

Unfortunately, Lisa Kudrow is in both movies, and it looks like they made her up to look like she was made of plastic.  And she's not really funny.  And her acting is not up to the same level as Crystal and Deniro.

And the guy who plays Jelly steals just about every scene he's in.",1356307200,,604,4.2368421052631575

1854352,4,B00008NJFT,"Billy Crystal is a comic genious,and ""Analyze This"" is hysterically funny! This is a 2-sided (Non-Blu-Ray) DVD (""Analyze This"" (side one) and ""Analyze That"" (side two)).I mention here that, as of this date (9-30-11), I have only watched ""Analyze This"". So that's the side of the DVD I'll review here.

The sound and picture quality are first-rate. I watched it on a Sony Blu-Ray player and Sony 40"" flatscreen TV (with 1080p capability). I also mention that the seller provided first quality service and the DVD arrived quickly in perfect condition. Good extras...especially the easy to navigate menu (with sound)featuring the trailer and scene selection (You'll want to replay the big ""meeting"" scene near the end of the movie multiple times! It's that funny!).

Now,about the film ""Analyze This"", just in case you have not seen it. DeNiro and Crystal are absolutely magnificent together, Crystal as a psychiatrist who,through a quirk of fate, inherits mob-boss DeNiro as his patient. Hilarious stuff! No wonder there HAD to be a sequel. And let's not forget the rest of the ensemble--everyone is first-rate,including Lisa Kudrow,as Crystal's fiancee...so quirky and realistically annoying that one hopes the on-screen marriage never occurs!(For Billy's own good!).

Oustanding script and direction...the movie flies by and you'll wish it was longer! I need to say that the big ""meeting scene"" near the end of the film is laugh out loud funny,replay it multiple times funny, and even laugh the next day funny! Billy Crystal is THE BEST...Wait until you hear his spiel at the mob meeting...you'll be in tears of laughter!

I purchased this DVD on the strength of having seen it on broadcast TV,and enjoying it so much. I do need to mention that I had to deduct 1 star because the ""R"" rating is well-earned here. Unfiltered by network TV, be ready for: A few sexual situations and some moderate violence, but the language is really coarse. Lots of F-bombs, etc.. If I could have the ability to filter that out (""Analyze THAT""???)...or at least tone it down some, I'd do it. Having said that, one might argue that the language was necessary to add the realism of the subject matter and the ""streets"". Perhaps...but this mars an otherwise 7-star effort.

There are no perfect movies out there...no perfect roses. HOWEVER, if one is able to look beyond the rugged language, which I would call the ""thorns"" of ""Analyze This"", one finds a BOUQUET of ROSES...a masterpiece of comedy. In this day and age, I think we all need a good laugh. And ""Analyze This"" delivers a huge helping of belly laughs! On a final note, I don't want to spoil the surprise, but amongst the wonderful music soundtrack of ""Analyze This"", look for a surprise and cool cameo by the great Tony Bennett. You'll love that extra treat!

I look forward to viewing side 2 of this DVD soon. If ""Analyze That"" is even half as good as ""Analyze This"", it'll be a fun ride!",1317340800,,2929,4.859719438877756
1854353,5,B00008NJFT,"I give this movie 5 stars, I wish it could be higher, it is a excellent film, very good acting between Deniro and Crystal, totally funny.

1854354,4,B00008NJFT,I had been looking for a combined feature of these two films for some time without much success until I found it at Amazon at a very favorable price.  These are 2 very funny films and their combination on a single dvd was exactly what I was looking for. Very enjoyable films.,1311638400,,275,4.288461538461538
1854355,1,B00008NJFT,"These comments apply to the ""Comedy Double Feature"" Blu-ray.

Inside the case, there is only ONE disc even though two movies are bundled together.

This would have been fine if they had used a dual layer (50GB) disc, but to me it appears that both the movies have been crammed in on a single layer (25GB) disc.

The bit rate is really low and the video quality suffers badly, to the point that it is virtually indistinguishable from that of a DVD.

Don't waste your money on this Blu-ray. Just buy the DVD or opt for the two dollar download.",1301097600,31,541,4.38
1854356,4,B00008NJFT,"I think more blu-rays should come in the cheaper double feature format. ""Analyze This"" is the best thing Billy Crystal has done -- he plays a jaded, milquetoast analyst living in his father's shadow, suddenly thrown into the world of the mob, while trying to start a new life with a new wife.  ""Analyze That"" continues when mobster-patient De Niro is released from prison in Crystal's FBI-imposed custody. What? A lot more talky than the faster, tenser, and funnier predecessor -- and no Chazz Palminteri. But it's not without its moments, namely De Niro's dream image of Crystal as a snorting Sigmund Freud, and outtakes during the closing credits.",1299888000,,649,4.954128440366972
1854357,3,B00008NJFT,"Analyze This and and Analyze That have two terrific stars - Billy Crystal, a natural comic, and Robert DeNiro, a brilliant actor, who is as adept at comedy as he is at anything else he portrays.  Of course in both films DeNiro's comedy is played from the mouth of a tough guy mafioso, which he seems, like James Cagney of another movie era, to do best.  ""...This"" has very funny moments all based on the fact that a genunine murdering fiend is suffering from having lost his father, and is no longer an effective killer.  Billy Crystal, a psychiatrist, about to be married for a second time, is pressed into duty, by the mobster.  By movie's end progress is made, and DeNiro reforms as he quits the mob and marches off to jail while singing Crystal's praises.
  The second film is simply terrific acting by the stars, who play their roles in a contrived story, and therein lies the problem of the second film.  Chas Palminteri is as good as DeNiro in his tough guy role.  All in all, it's fun entertainment based on an immoral premise.  ""...This"" is very funny; ""...That"" we can do without!",1287187200,,1090,4.520408163265306
1854358,5,B00008NJFT,DeNiro & Crystal are one of the best comedy teams I've seen in years.  I didn't think they could top analyze this with a sequel and yet they did with analyze that.  Couldn't pass up getting both these movies as a double feature on dvd.,1285459200,,235,4.2
1854359,5,B00008NJFT,"good series of movies, delivered on time as promised. I wish they wouldn't put two movies on one disk but the price was right!!!! Great addition to my comedy collection.",1284336000,,169,4.666666666666667

But main's ""This"" looks dark and soft (Like a Frantic/Presumed Innocent), but ""That"" looks great. So I liked ""This"", but I like to watch ""That"" now. So I think great buy!

1854362,5,B00008NJFT,"I've seen this movie on TV riddled with commercials, and still loved it.  ""Analyze This"" is a great movie and puts together to film greats (Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal).  You'll laugh until you cry.  I also have to put in a plug for Jelly (Joe Viterelli), which frequently played in mob pictures.  Joe plays such a great part and has some great dialogue, with a lot of laughs!  Buy this and you won't be sorry.",1257724800,,415,4.337662337662338
1854363,5,B00008NJFT,"As an avid viewer of the gangster genre, I went into this one with high hopes...and wasn't disappointed. This film paints mobsters in the same sympathetic light that the original Godfather does (not the other ones, of course). DeNiro reenacts his famous heavy-handed mobster role with a whole new perspective in this very entertaining comedy. His off the wall character of a mob boss who breaks into tears at random intervals is priceless. Crystal works as the perfect dichotomy as the nervous psychologist who winds up over his head before he knows what has hit him. This film, although nothing past a simple comedy, is terrifically written and has more than it's fair share of laughs. Watch it. Have fun.",1220140800,12,706,4.891666666666667

1854365,4,B00008NJFT,"still very funny depiction of mobsters and their doctors...

How can you go wrong with DeNiro and Crystal?

The scene with Chaz Palmenteri in the warehouse with Billy Crystal speaking for the Family is still one of the greatest scenes...

The sequel is good too but buy it for the original.",1215216000,2,290,4.647058823529412
