1715516,5,B000067IVT,"This is clearly one of the most cinematic shows in television history and it is the reason the DVD format is so wonderful. Now instead of watching (and re-watching) slowly degrading video tapes Farscape will be able to be viewed in all of its glory.  Why it took them so long to come out with a boxed set I have no idea.  The idea of buying 2 episodes at a time was ridiculous.  The success of other TV shows boxed set's (X-Files, Buffy, and the Sopranos, just to name a few) have proved that the full season boxed set is the way to go. I look forward to the bonus material they are bound to include.",1028851200,,600,4.155172413793103
1715517,5,B000067IVT,"If you're really needing a show that makes you feel as though you've left your living room and gone on one wild ride, this is the show for you.  I've not look forward to watching a show since STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION was on TV.  The stories are strong and engrossing and the characters are believeable.
Brian Henson (Jim Henson Company) has got a real winner with this show and now that the whole season is coming out on DVD, it will be difficult not to do a marathon all at once!
Save money, don't buy the individual discs...buy the whole season and have a family night.",1028851200,10,577,4.333333333333333
1715518,5,B000067IVT,"Well, well, it has taken over a year for ADV to finally realize that it needs to release a season of Farscape all at once in a boxed set.  Instead of 11 cases of 1 disc each with 2 episodes per disc, this boxed set will have 6 cases with 2 discs each with again 2 episodes per disc.  I'm guessing the 6th case will have a additional disc loaded with extras.  But don't hold me on that until the specs are released.
Now I'm calculating that this box set with ... displayed price it comes out to be that the price per episode will between 40 and 53% cheaper than if you were to buy them separately.  Not bad really.  That is the very reason why I refused to buy the 2-episode discs.  Insane marketing ploy.  Anyway, with this set and the apparent new way they're marketing Season 2, I think I may join the Farscape Fanbase.
Now with the Farscape premise.  Farscape is the story of an Earth space explorer who gets transported through a wormhole into an alien interstellar war.  He encounters and docks with a living spaceship called Moya who is carrying a band of escaped outcasts.  They join forces and experience a myriad of stellar space adventures against the evil forces of the alien system.
I haven't watched Farscape since the start of the series and I lost the time for it and interest about it.  But now with the advent of these series making it onto DVD, now's the time to jump back in.  Come join Chriton and Moya in a hellava ride.",1027728000,16,1441,4.315985130111524
1715519,5,B000067IVT,"In case you haven't guessed, I'm am totally thrilled about this collection.  The day that I got it, I sat down and watched six straight hours of Farscape.  Sweet.  The eps chosen are absolutely wonderful (DNA Mad Scientist has always been one of my favorites) and for someone like me who missed most of the first season, it was a geat way to pick up the good, essential moments from Season 1.  The only drawback that I can think of is that they could have released more eps (maybe 8 instead of 6) but I might just be saying that because I want to watch somemore Farscape now.  I am SO hoping that they decide to do this for Seasins 2 and 3 too.",1027382400,4,644,4.161290322580645
1715520,5,B000067IVT,"I don't have cable, but have heard a lot about this series from friends. Their consensus: they love it.
When this collection was announced, I thought it would be a good way to see what this ""Farscape"" thing is all about. Turns out, I now have a new favorite TV show...heck, even my wife got into it (""for the love interest between Aeryn and John"") and she is not a fan of science fiction. ""Farscape"" exceeds my expectations of what a TV series is capable of. It is safe to say, this series is better than most movies in vision, scope, and excitement.
My one warning to you is it will leave you wanting more (how did you long time fans survive between seasons 1 and 2?). I now HAVE to get Season 2, Volume 1 (last episode of this Best-Of set is the cliffhanger season finale), also counting the days until the Complete Season 1 Box Set is listed...so I can get my hands on the other 16 episodes not included in this collection.",1027036800,3,926,4.297142857142857

1715569,5,B000067IVT,"So, is there anyone out there that doesn't know what FarScape is about? I suppose there might be a few... OK, here goes.
This is the 'Anti-Star Trek'; a dystopian, nihilistic romp into another quadrant filled with Peace Keepers (PK) that aren't, a myriad of boogeymen with tentacles and often shifting loyalties. Technology is off the charts, psi-ability is not uncommon, the Scarrans are your worst nightmare and they are coming to a quadrant near you. The PK's are pooping their pants and here comes a half-Scarran/half-PK that is one of the best 'Villains' I have had the pleasure to meet... from this side of the tv thankyouverymuch. The dude totally creeps me out.
So John Crichton (JC) is sucked into a wormhole and lands right in the middle of a magnificent space battle between a few escaped prisoners aboard a living ship imprisoned by the PK, who want that ship and it's escaping prisoners. JC looks just like the species that are PK and that is not a good thing for JC. AND... so starts the fun and games.
If you like alien creatures, plot twists, awesome costuming (for the most part), great sets, excellent script writing with lots of silliness and pathos, love stories and betrayals, a certain way of leading you in one direction and dropping you into another dimension and a healthy dose of cynical reality about the attitude of humans towards 'Aliens'. Did I mention that Moya (the ship that's alive) and crew visit earth? It doesn't go well but what do you expect from humans, hm?
We have watched this series start to finish at least five times and we still love it. At the end of the series, there was such an outcry from its fan base (I was one) for it to continue that they made a movie so the story could have a good place to end... and it is a GOOD ending!
Highly recommended, buy it... you won't be sorry!",1475884800,5,1828,4.542424242424242

1715602,5,B000067IVT,"Loved this show back in 2000 when it first came out on SciFi network, even if some of the episodes are a bit cheesy and poorly written. Missed numerous episodes due to what seemed like flaky broadcast schedules (the show seemed to disappear from SciFi for weeks at a time and then would randomly reappear, and I missed season 3+ entirely). Gives me a chance to catch up with what I missed, and the show doesn't seem dated at all, despite being 15 years old now (hard to believe its been that long!)",1462406400,,498,4.365591397849462

1715627,5,B000067IVT,"I love the concept of peacekeepers being the bad guys. Very 1984. Maybe the UN needs to rename their own peacekeepers, but their peacekeepers don't really stop anyone from fighting. They just sit around with light blue helmets. Love the mix of puppetry and live actors. Some of the concepts are tired. One character seems Klingon, another Ferengi, but I like the humor of the Terran and the unpredictable however stoic behavior of the Peacekeeper. She keeps me glued to the show.",1445472000,,479,4.853658536585366

1715648,5,B000067IVT,"This is a great show that I just recently discovered. The characters are creative and interesting individually, but what I particularly like is their change over time in reaction to each other. And none become parodies of themselves or, as so often happens, become one-dimensional and boring.

Without going into details, the primary ""villain"" is one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen. Initially an evil monster he turns out to be incredibly complex with a humane side competing with an all-consuming goal that is not evil. I've never seen a character, particularly a bad guy, turn out to be so impossible to judge morally. I don't remember if he shows up in the first season, but he is in most of the rest of the series and is a primary reason to stick with it, even beyond the great main character.",1428278400,,816,4.706293706293707

1715935,5,B000067IVT,"Fantasico! I've loved Farscape since it first aired. The episodes are well written and the aliens are well done. John Crichton is the perfect everyman who helps us know what it feels like to be in their universe. ""Never swallow the dentik"" He is warned. He swallows anyway and says, ""Minty?"" in a hopeful way. Another favorite is when Crichton says: ""Don't move or I'll fill you full of little yellow bolts of light!"" The show is both inventive and funny. It is truly a gem.",1425081600,3,474,4.523255813953488

I find myself laughing one moment, frowning another, and near tears the next.  There is a depth of feeling from the beginning that captures the attention and the imagination and leaves one rather hungry for the next episode.  There is chemistry, bonding, friendship and dysfunction in this mismatched family of beings, yet I am drawn into their story more and more and find myself easily swept along with them through each episode.  And I shall never cease to be amazed by the ""soul"" that comes through the muppet characters, Rygel and Pilot.  So very expressive!  I know living, breathing people who exhibit far less emotion and depth of character than these muppets.  I think you will enjoy this series if you have not previously endulged.  If you have, then why not indulge again from the beginning.",1425081600,2,975,4.8545454545454545

1715940,4,B000067IVT,"This is a funny and interesting series. The base concept is very similar to Lexx -- a  living ship that  flies through the universe with a motley crew that includes criminals, tricksters, as well as honest persons and even rulers and law-enforcers. However, the treatment is very different. Lexx focuses a lot on sex and romance. Farscape focuses more on returning home. Returning home is the priority of every member of the crew. But even if everyone were able to return home, still, they would feel pain at parting. So there is a degree of ambivalence which makes the show interesting and also emotionally appealing.",1425081600,,618,4.876190476190477

Once you get past the lack of science based belief suspension, the show is actually quite good. The acting is very surprisingly good at times and the comic relief frequently provided to reset the tension is well timed. The show does not take itself too seriously, the animatronics are well done (thanks to the Jim Henson folks and a decent (for a change) budget).

(example the old Howdie Doodie show) for those of you old enough to remember that show. They were called animatronics and it took as many as 8 (Pilot) people to control them. If you want a series in your collection this is the one to have. I dare you to find a series with the make-up (Award winning Henson Creature shop) to match theres on a weekly basis.

1716172,5,B000067IVT,"I love this series.  Season 1 is by far my favorite in the FS franchise.  Jim Hensen did the puppets and they are very lifelike.  I still feel as if Rygel and Pilot are real.  Moya was totally believable as a living ship, the idea of a pilot being sucked through a wormhole on a test mission and being tossed into an alien world was a great premise.  It was very difficult to watch John Crichton and the actor Claudia Black not be together when they both moved to SG after the show cancellation.  Not to worry though, the show was revived for a final made for tv movie and it has a completed story arc.  The CGI still holds up by today standards.

First year characters are a demented captain out for revenge, a human, far flung cousins the peacekeepers, a race of toad like creatures, a living plant, a grey lady from Nembari, and a caste system peoples called the Luxons,  living ships called Leviathons animatronics by Hensen make these foreign creatures come alive.",1418515200,,969,4.4602272727272725

However, and I  haven't watched the entire series yet, the 2nd Season has gotten a bit old with Chrichton being too pushy and presumptuous in his 'knowing' what's the right way to do things.  I do like the way they are developing the other characters, especially Chiana, qwerky, but fun.  Not real fond of how they bounce D'Argo back and forth romantically between Chiana and Aeryn though.

1716234,5,B000067IVT,"I have always loved this show, so it was great to finally get to see an episode I had never seen before and revisit some old favorites.  Some people claim the first season was the only good one.  More people would say that it is something you just have to get through to understand bits of continuity that get mentioned in the other seasons.  I think the first season is pretty darn good.  There is evidence that indicates that they were still trying to figure out what kind of show they wanted to be as they went along, but that doesn't mean there are a bunch of dud episodes or anything like that.  What it does mean is that there are a few episodes that could be described as what one of the Star Trek shows might be like if they didn't always assume that the values and perspectives of the crew members from earth are better than those of the aliens they meet. So, that leads to some interesting situations where the guy from earth is wrong about how to deal with the problem they're facing that week.  Ben Browder once described his character John Crichton as the anti-Kirk.  That is especially true during the first season as he gradually goes from being mostly useless to the rest of the cast except when he's saving their bacon by negotiating with somebody to figuring out how to be a valuable member of the team.

The show originally borrowed heavily from stuff such as Blake's 7, Buck Rogers and the original Trek, so a hater might think it's just Blake's 7 with puppets, but they still did some really fun stuff with genre tropes in the first season. One of many neat bits is how they made Crichton genre-savvy so he can fake his way through situations because he has seen other SF shows. Another interesting thing is that they did a pretty good job of making genuinely alien aliens.  They usually aren't just people with weird nose ridges from cultures clearly based on something from our world.  They have religions, value systems, etc. that imply all sorts of things beyond what we get to see in the episodes so they feel more like they really came from another world.  Take Zhaan, for example.  Her New Age-y spirituality is very Nineties, but at the same time her dialogue feels very much like it came from a culture the writers took a lot of time to develop. Another interesting thing is that the human looking aliens are the bad guys, challenging a fundamental assumption of most SF shows.  This show embraces multi-culturalism in a way that is better than any other SF show I have personally seen.",1417305600,,2516,4.503296703296703

1716295,5,B000067IVT,"As a huge fan of science fiction shows who has grown tired of waiting for a new sci-fi or space opera series, I decided to check out some of the classic shows I missed during their original runs, including Farscape.

I admit to being skeptical about Farscape. There's the barriers of entry: heavy prosthetics, makeup, puppets, and the fact that this was produced in 1999. I was sure this would be cheesy, dated, and silly.  In fact, I was initially turned off by the lack of widescreen, HD video quality I have come to expect from streaming services and the awful opening credits sequence.  Thankfully, I stuck with the pilot and have now made it through the first season.  Farscape season 1 has been one of the most enjoyable TV seasons I have ever seen.

There's the cast of lovable characters, headed by the every-man character of John Crichton.  He's about as likable a main character as I could ask for: funny, handsome, smart, and has a good heart. He's supported by a blue-skinned , zen-like priestess named Zhaan, a ferocious, octopus-like warrior character named D'hargo, a small, toad-like puppet character named Rygel, the adorable Pilot, who is pilot of the living spaceship (yup!) named Moya, and one of the greatest female characters in all of science fiction, Aeryn Sun.  It is the adventures and bond of these characters that drew me in above all else.

If I can point out a few complaints, I'll start with the villain: Captain Crais.  In season 1, he is extremely cartoonish and one of the weakest links.  Also, some of the alien species are really silly, embarrassingly so.  Thankfully, the pluses of the show outweigh the negatives.

The plot of the first season, to be honest, is bizarre and should be experienced, not read about in a review.  There is definitely a serialized element, so you need to watch episodes in their original order, but there are also several stand-alone episodes mixed in that provide some nice character development and world-building.

If you're a fan of fun science fiction adventure, with well-developed, likable characters, do yourself a favor, and try Farscape.

Other science fiction I enjoy: Syfy's Battlestar Galactica, Lost, Fringe, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles",1415404800,,2228,4.935656836461126

1716316,5,B000067IVT,"A nice touch for the scifi scene that was desperately needed during the time it was running. The first season was a bit experimental setting up the story with only minor blemishes towards the end of season 1 and early season 2. The writers were able to balance properly a positive sense of tongue and cheek and making fun of overly repeated storylines to keep the episodic format from getting too stale. The later seasons is where the fans get to see the serious drama and opera that scifi fans love. I would credit Farscape's later seasons for paving the way for Ronald D. Moore's vision of Battlestar Galactica to bring the Serious Drama and raw nature characters that fans wanna see. Farscape doesn't get as serious and dark as BSG, unfortunately, but maintains the tongue and cheek throughout for a positive scifi experience for someone looking to break into the science fiction genre. Plus, if you loved the Jim Henson Trinitiy (  Never Ending Story, Labrynth, Dark Crystal ) growing up then this series is for you with an analgous style of sets and electronics.",1414454400,,1067,4.736559139784946

1716403,4,B000067IVT,"The show is awesome, but anyone who goes to buy this probably already know that. So instead I wanted to gripe about the 1080 transfer.

1) The audio is pretty bad. The audio transfer was definitely untouched. It may have been converted to lossless but it sounds no different at all from any old TV with awful speakers back when the show aired
2) Picture quality is no different than on Netflix, and anyone who uses Netflix knows that picture quality is poor at best. I use a 42"" 1080p 120Hz TV and I can still say that this picture transfer must have simply been upconverted and not actually digitally transferred like you may want (in other words blu ray will look the same as the DVD versions)
3) NOT WIDESCREEN---- BLACK BARS BUGABOO-- As with so many other blu ray converted TV shows, the BLACK BARS are a part of the picture, which means unlike with DVD versions, you CANNOT crop or stretch the screen. This is an eyesore. I have movies on DVD from 1930 that are less annoying than the black bars on this show
----I full understand that a TV show shot in 4:3 cannot actually become widescreen naturally, but this doesn't mean that the show MUST have black bars that are part of the image format. It prevents cropping and stretching for those who would prefer a forced widescreen rather than maintaining the aspect ratio. The DVD version can do this, why not blu ray!!",1411948800,2,1372,4.488

Ben Crowder's timing is also what makes this a great series.  Great addition and much fun when they did the last part of the Star Gate series.

1716539,4,B000067IVT,"An older but good science fiction series! A great premise, good acting but simple basic special effects.  Yes, some characters are puppets but the writing and the other characters interaction with them help you suspend your disbelief.  Complex yet family friendly problems, I found myself and my kids  entertained with lots to discuss after viewing ( what would they do if someone decided to be an enemy for a poor reason and wouldn't accept your apologies?).  It has witty dialogue  you don't want to miss.  Even with other more advanced special effect choices out there somehow I kept being drawn back to these episodes. Science fiction that teaches scientific principles is a precious thing, too. I actually understood things better because of the writing and the visuals. But most of all, I loved the main characters.

1716592,5,B000067IVT,"I have already reviewed the boxed set of Farscape that contains all four seasons.  I'm posting here in response to many of the low reviews.  It seems that a major complaint by viewers is against the muppets/puppets.  I have a hard time relating to this as I see Rygel and Pilot as real characters.  So real that they deserved their own introduction during the opening theme.  Bad acting is another complaint I've seen.  I don't know, maybe I'm just a bad judge, but the acting is awesome and totally sells the show.  The only character that I felt was uneven was Zhaan.  But having said that, her presence was certainly unique and helped give the show a recognizable face.

Here's the thing about Farscape.  At first the episodes are largely standalone episodes and the show is still trying to find itself.  But when two new characters are added to the show during the first season (episodes 15 and 19 to be precise), the entire show changes.  Yes, there's still a clunker here and there (although for the real fans, even a Farscape clunker is still pretty dammed good).  Plus, when I rewatch, I have a new appreciation for those early episodes, because I know where it's all leading.

Farscape was a very ambitious show and really struck a nerve with me.  Of course, it won't be for everyone.  For instance, after watching Farscape I just can't get into Firefly or Battlestar Galactica (the updated series).  Not every show is meant for every viewer.

But if you're new to Farscape or looking to give Farscape a chance, I recommend ignoring the muppet comparisons and the bad acting comments.  And get through season 1.  You will meet someone who can give Darth Vader a run for his money (and in my opinion, surpasses him).",1406678400,,1724,4.645695364238411

1716676,5,B000067IVT,"I love this show. It mixes the best of typical scifi tropes with good acting, unusual characters, and Jim Henson puppetry. Farscape is a more serious scifi that, if you were able to bear through seasons 1&2 of Star Trek: The Next Generation, will far and away exceed your expectations

John Crichton, our main protagonist, is a bit on the ""too good to be true"" side. He's funny, thinks out of the box, deceptively intelligent (given the jokes and references he makes, he comes across as more of a nerd than one would expect). Personally, it's his quirky nature that I find most enjoyable. It's easy to forget that he's actually supposed to be a smart guy, astronaut and all that, considering he gives off more of a country feel to his antics and personable nature. He's humble in some respects, arrogant in others. I like his character because he's relatable and more human than most human scifi characters.

I think the show is watching for him and his character development alone.",1404086400,,982,4.703488372093023

Some episodes of Farscape will play perfectly. Unfortunately random episodes are very dark
with poor resolution. To test I switched from HD to SD and still had poor results.

To be sure it was not my hardware/software causing the problem I played HD 1080p movie trailers
with 5.1 sound. They looked & sounded perfect.

This has happened in episodes from every season. I don't know if this also occurs with the DVD's

Ben Browder is a bit of the buffoon (would NASA really hire someone like this and give him his own program??), but the show has enough interpersonal character-building and revelation to make up for that.  No, it doesn't have the kind of cohesivity and panache that Stargate (at least, the first six seasons) had, but then it predates Stargate by a year.

Saying it isn't as bad as that dreadful ""Lost"" series is saying a lot.  [Gilligan's Island was better than ""Lost"".]

1716813,5,B000067IVT,"Sometimes sci fi, always adventure space opera, Farscape holds up well for being 15 years old. If you like a little bit of gritty, and a lot a fast action this is for you. The general plot is pretty generic (essentially Alice in Wonderland) but unlike most science fiction the aliens actually are alien. Some people can't get past the Jim Henson muppet-actors, but they still look good and CG eventually becomes dated.
Another thing that makes this show remarkable is the inclusion of strong female characters. Yes, they do have relationships, but that doesn't solely define them any more than the males.",1400284800,,604,4.87378640776699

John Robert Crichton, Jr. /kratn/, played by Ben Browder, is an International Aeronautics and Space Administration (most commonly referred to on the show as IASA) astronaut who, in the opening few minutes of the pilot episode, is accidentally catapulted through a wormhole across the universe, thus setting the scene for the show as a whole. As the only regularly appearing human on the show, he is the main focus and is the main character as he narrates the weekly credits and is the only character to appear in every episode. Along with Michael Shanks' character of Daniel Jackson in Stargate SG-1, Browder's Crichton has been called one of the sexiest male characters in science fiction.[1]

Although Crichton is a heroic and unwaveringly loyal character, he is also a mischievously comical one, so much so that he is the primary source of humor for the series. The show derives much of its humor from Crichton's habitual (and extensive) use of Earth-related pop culture references, often used as witty mockery in the face of danger or opponents who, being unfamiliar with the references, are unaware that they are being insulted. Although an occasional reference will provoke curiosity or confusion to his friends, Crichton's fellow shipmates are largely unaffected by these comments because they simply assume them to be native Earth terms that cannot be interpreted by translator microbes and merely extrapolate the meaning from its context.

Information about John Crichton's life before the first episode is only revealed slowly over the course of the series. He was the middle child born to Jack (an astronaut) and Leslie Crichton. He has two sisters, Olivia (his younger sister) and an older sister, Susan. He has a childhood friend named Douglas ""D.K."" Knox. John's mother died of cancer four years before his Farscape One accident. John Crichton followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an astronaut, flew on two missions prior to the Farscape incident and was Mission Commander on one of those missions.

In the first episode of season one, during a test flight designed to prove a scientific theory concerning the use of planetary gravity as a means for spaceship acceleration, a wormhole appears, and John and his 'Farscape One' module are pulled into and through it. On his exit from the wormhole, he finds himself in the middle of a spaceship dogfight, during which he accidentally causes the death of Tauvo Crais, the brother of Peacekeeper Captain Bialar Crais. Crichton's craft is pulled aboard a large spaceship named Moya, a Leviathan (a biomechanoid, i.e., a 'living ship'), where John meets his first aliens (Zhaan, D'Argo, Aeryn Sun and Rygel). Shortly after, John meets Bialar Crais, who wants revenge for his brother's death. John has to adapt rather quickly to a life with aliens, guns, and space travel, without the comfort of Earth culture. Toward the end of season one, Crichton encounters a mysterious alien race known only as The Ancients, who hide a repository of wormhole knowledge into his brain to guide him home, beginning a series-long chase by a Sebacean-Scarran hybrid Peacekeeper called Scorpius who hunts John and the rest of the Farscape crew to obtain that information.

Early in season two, Crichton learns that Scorpius has implanted a neural chip into his head, which causes hallucinations of a 'neural clone' of Scorpius, whom he dubs ""Harvey"". These hallucinations influence Crichton in an effort to get at the hidden wormhole knowledge. As a result, Crichton's behavior grows more erratic and unpredictable, even as he continues to have romantic feelings for Aeryn Sun. In the end of Season 2, the neural chip takes complete control over Crichton (resulting in a Scorpius/Crichton mixed personality with extremely dark humor) and transmits a message to Scorpius. Shortly after that Harvey defeats Aeryn in an aerial dogfight and kills her. After Aeryn's death, Crichton regains control. The chip is removed, but stolen by Scorpius. With the beginning of Season three, Harvey still remains in Crichton's head. A few episodes later, Crichton is ""twinned"" by another alien. Neither of the Crichtons can be called a copy, but are ""equal and original."" After the duplication it was soon discovered that Harvey was twinned as well. Eventually, the crew of Moya is split across the two Leviathans, Moya and Talyn, and they are subsequently separated from each other. Each ship has one Crichton. The Crichton aboard Talyn begins a romantic relationship with Aeryn while the Crichton on Moya continues studying wormholes, helped by the repository in his brain. Jack the Ancient finds the Talyn Crichton, forcibly extracts Harvey and unlocks the wormhole knowledge. Crichton later dies of radiation poisoning from a wormhole weapon. When the survivors of the two crews are reunited, Aeryn (in her grief) is very cold to the remaining Crichton(due to him having different memories about the last few months). The crew members of Moya start going their separate ways at the end of season three. Just after Aeryn Sun leaves Crichton, seemingly for good, he learns that she is pregnant with his child(whether the child belongs to the original Crichton or the Talyn Crichton is left unknown).

Early season four leaves Crichton with nothing but time to work on his wormhole theories. He eventually reunites with the crew members of Moya and Aeryn and Scorpius, who has fallen out of favor with Peacekeeper high command. Shortly, after arrival, Scorpius offers to remove Harvey. Due to the neural clone's longer presence within and increased familiarity with Crichton, Harvey's reaction includes persuasion and appeal to sympathy rather than threats. Crichton still agrees to allow Scorpius to remove the lingering neural spillover. Halfway through the season, Crichton finds his way back to Earth, but he voluntarily gives up the dream of Earth and returns to Moya. After a series of dangerous events (including Harvey's resurrection), Crichton and Aeryn find time alone together. Aeryn tells him he is the father of her child, and Crichton proposes to her. The moment she accepts, an alien craft melts the two and ends the season.

Crichton and Aeryn are revived at the beginning of The Peacekeeper Wars mini-series, and Crichton uses his wormhole knowledge to successfully force a peace treaty between the warring Peacekeepers and Scarrans. The wormhole knowledge in his brain is finally removed by Einstein the Ancient. During the mini-series, Aeryn gives birth to their son named D'Argo Sun-Crichton in honor of their late comrade.",1393027200,,6592,5.172446110590441

I realize this show was not filmed for HD, that's not the issue.  The video was so dark much of the definition was lost in many of the scenes, and given the show uses a pretty dark pallet when on Moya the video is unwatchable when the stream is even darker.  When I switched to my DVD's using the same connection/device (PS3) i use to stream with I had no issues with the video and the show looked great.  I have also not had any issues with other shows/movies from Amazon prime so I am very confident the issue lies with the video Prime is streaming for this show in particular.",1392940800,,805,4.269736842105263

By the end of the season it get's a little repetitive and they only mix it up every once and a while, but in my opinion it is worth it.  The premise may be a bit over played in the sci-fi genera but I give it a pass because they make it a fun show.
The creatures look wonderful as well as the set design, and the landscapes were very well captured.
In short, this show has all of the elements that the Sci-fi channel has forgotten about and would do well to try and recapture some of the magic that was one of my favorite space travel series... Farscape!",1392854400,,1098,4.3463414634146345

1717383,5,B000067IVT,"Who ever thought to create a story in which the human was the straight man to all alien characters and technology.  There are elements of this series that are reminiscent of ""Buck Rogers In The 25th Century"" with Gil Gerard back in the seventies.  Where Buck Rogers was a man out of time, John Crichton became a human out of place.  Due to an experiment in space travel gone wrong this John Wayne like astronaut finds himself far from home.  The aliens who become his companions, tutors and sometimes students take the viewer on a journey of alien worlds, cultures and  ways of thinking.

This story is truly one of the most innovative ideas in contemporary science fiction.  Ironically, John Crichton played by Ben Browder is an astronaut forced to live among aliens with no way to get home thanks to a wormhole accident.  Ben Browder later joined SG1 and traveled through wormholes each weak to the series' conclusion.  In this case he was the human who forced himself onto aliens and experienced the politics of his own people not mixing with other cultures.

Ben Browder's most recent experience in Sci Fi allowed him to play out his John Wayne like image to its ultimate expression as the sheriff of an old west town in an episode of Doctor Who.

One thing is for sure, Ben Browder seems destined to be a human among aliens in much of his career and for those who loved the pseudo western sci-fi of Firefly, Farscape is a good option to feel that same sense of testosterone driven, semi-sci-fi, semi-western persona on a large scale.",1391904000,,1538,4.638376383763838

""bad"" and ""good"" are subjective feelings and ideas about a person and how they should or shouldn't behave. instead of this black and white inaccurate sketch of beings across the world of farscape, characters act upon individual agendas (in which can be justified uniquely by the acting individual). perspective plays a secondary role in how we perceive these characters.",1389312000,,691,5.178571428571429

I loved the fact that the 2nd episode of the series has John Crichton(played by Ben Browder) being the first contact for another civilization after just having his civilizations first contact in the episode before. My next fave would have to be PK Tech Girl where Crichton has a fleeting moment with a Peacekeeper Tech that they find stranded on an old Peacekeeper ship that had disappeared a hundred years before and has been stripped down over time for salvage.

Then I grew up and became an adult, doing adult things. One day, by accident, I caught an episode of Farscape. I was hooked. My life was pretty hectic at the time, and there were times I would miss an episode. These days, I have much more time on my hands, and I am so glad to be able to go back and watch the story unfold from the very beginning. Farscape is the most original Sci-Fi series I've ever seen. The idea of a living organism as a ship, with a matched pilot itself is a new concept. The interplay between the different species on board, working together while at the same time being at odds frequently, is something that Star Trek did not play on. Yes, this is an original!",1389225600,,829,4.1875

It isn't until Chiana joins the crew where the show stops being stale and alternatively does a better job at exploring the dynamic between male/female interaction on a ship than TNG. The reality is that everyone is having sex with everyone else at different times and bonds are formed which evolve into whole constitutions between shipmates on general operating procedures. Farscape taps into this dynamic quite well, but only really like I said when Chiana joins.

1717984,4,B000067IVT,"I originally watched the Farscape series when it appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel. I recently found these series on Amazon. The series can be streamed for free if you are a member of Amazon Prime.

As a background, the series was originally developed for Australian television. Viewers who have watched other Sci-Fi series - most notably SG-1 - should recognize Ben Browder and Claudia Black. The Farscape series was produced by Jim Henson Productions. The characters of Rygel and Pilot are creations of Jim Henson's Creature Shop.

There are 4 seasons to the series which originally aired over the 1999 - 2003 timeframe. Unfortunately, the series was cancelled after the 4th season.

The series starts with Ben Browder who plays John Crichton. During a test flight, John Crichton is sucked through a wormhole. On his exit, he is in the middle of a space battle between Peacekeepers and a prison break aboard Moya. Moya is a Leviathan or living ship.

John accidentally causes the crash of one of the Peacekeeper fighters and the death of its pilot. This turns out to be the brother of the Captain of the Peacekeepers. This accident provides one of the series storylines as Captain Crais tries to avenge his brother's death by pursuing John Crichton.

On board Moya, John Crichton meets Zhaan, Rygel, Aeryn, D'Argo, and the Pilot.

The plots of the series focus on John trying to get back to earth, as well as the other characters trying to return to their own worlds, trying to keep away from the Peacekeepers, and the various interactions between the characters. The episodes can be a little dark at times. The characters of Zhann, Rygel, Aeryn, and D'Argo can be complex. The series slowly reveals more about each of the characters and why they ended up on a prison ship.

If you like the 4 seasons, watch ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" which was filmed later in 2004 as a follow-up to the series.",1379289600,,1900,4.792048929663609

1718063,3,B000067IVT,"The only thing worse than the acting in this show is the scripting. Whatever college intern who writes the dialogue and character actions should be fired. What the characters say, their actions, and behavior is so against what a normal person would do or say is almost insulting to the viewer. The show has a very loose plot based on a guy who goes ""Buck Rogers"" and finds himself in another part of the universe. Apparently being from a less technologically advanced world (earth) he is automatically required to act like an utter moron who gets beat up by a woman in every episode despite being a PHD holding scientist/astronaut with a good physique.

I started watching it after I ran out of Doctor Who and needed something to watch during lunch. It is entertaining enough to look past the insulting scripting for 45 minutes if just barely. I have to assume the writers went on to script other ""great"" shows like Arrow and Terra Nova. I will keep watching it as a show of last resort.",1377561600,,987,4.576271186440678

1718065,5,B000067IVT,"FarScape is one of those rare shows that transcends its genre and becomes something more. I discovered it by accident one night while flipping channels and was intrigued by what I saw, then entranced then addicted. Amazingly well written: watch the first five episodes and see how the groundwork for relationships, secrets and even medical/physical information about each of the characters is subtly weaved into the background of the A storylines and how that information has a ripple effect for the entire run of the show; and acted by everyone involved, including puppets, it is a mini movie per episode with production values that still stand up.",1377475200,,649,5.074766355140187

Farscape brought a new element to the science fiction genre.  They gave each participant a very distinct personality, from very different perspectives and backgrounds.  It made you understand how it takes many different elements to make up a truly remarkable team.  I occasionally find the originality in this series amazing.  Looking forward to enjoying this set for many years to come.  Thanks.",1377475200,,565,4.88421052631579
1718068,5,B000067IVT,"When this show started airing in 1999 it instantly became my favorite. I mean what was there to not like for a science fiction geek? All sorts of incredible spaceships, the living ship Moya being at the top of that list. Fantastic weaponry, alien races, and cultures, this show had it all for me. I had signed up for Dish Network not too long before that and they had this thing called a PVR built into some of their receivers, the name was later changed to DVR. In any case, mine was set to record this and another show by the name of Lexx every Friday night on the SciFi channel.
At first this show was relatively directionless, each episode fairly random in it's content but none the less enjoyable to watch. Toward the end of the first season the real plot begins to develop as the up till now main villain Crais is supplanted by an even more diabolical being known as Scorpius. Right around this time is where we also meet Chiana who only adds to the overall enjoyability factor.
This is also about the time the writers of this show seem to take the reins and come into their own as the story gets markedly better with the close of season one through the next few years. Then, much to my dismay, after four years of never missing an episode, WHACK! The show was cut and I was angry. I often have wondered why the creators of various TV shows bother to lay out intricate or elongated story lines when their is no loyalty to these shows from the executives from the studios. But then I realize the producers of the shows are working under the assumption their work will continue until they finish their story and have no real idea when or if the rug is going to be pulled out from under them by the money changers at the studio.
At least with Farscape we got a bit of closure when they came back with The Peackeeper Wars. And while I wasn't totally satisfied it was better than a multitude of other series that simply vanished from the TV lineup never to be heard from again.",1377388800,,1978,4.334231805929919

Amazon was the only place that had all the seasons for free if you have amazon prime so I was ecstatic and watched it! I remember loving it when I was younger but was never able to see the episodes consecutively. Boy am I glad I remembered it(not that you can really forget Farscape and John and Aeryn....you can't)...I mean I'm glad I searched it out finally! It is hands down my favorite sci-fi of all time...Roswell used to be my fav but it's now second and if you knew how obsessed I was with Roswell you'll know how hard it is to beat it which Farscape did.

Ben Browder is Commander John Crichton, who gets thrown through a worm-hole and transported to a far off galaxy populated by strange beings. He ends up on a living ship with a group of escaped prisoners that become his friends.

There are lots of 'aliens' some cute, some scarey, conflicts, shootouts, and moments. The series is the ""fish out of water"" person struggling to adapt to his circumstances.

The first few episodes took some getting used to--this seems to be the last of the good old fashioned Sci-fi-but it was fun once I got back into it.  I really enjoyed Ben Browder especially and how he plays Crichton--he's got a strong heart but a real guys-guy personality and its a great blend.

1718130,2,B000067IVT,"I'm surprised with the number of 5 star ratings for this show.  Soooo much of it is completely over the top.  They are constantly screaming and yelling, running around like chickens with their heads chopped off.  Firefights are embarrassing as literally 95%-99% of their shots miss, even when shooting from 3 feet in front of the target.  Then their lack of wanting to shoot at anything even when it's obvious they need to.  I.e. the enemy is shooting at them, attacking them and obviously trying to kill them, they will back up and go ""get away or I'll kill you"" then keep backing up, falling over, screaming in pain while they are being attacked, getting stabbed, and so on, but they won't pull the stupid trigger on the gun until it's almost too late, then of course they miss the target even though it's two feet away and the bad guy gets away to attack again later in the episode, sometimes over and over. It gets truly painful to watch.  I'm currently watching Episode 6 from season three ""Eat me"" and the main villain doesn't get shot at at all.  Even though he's just walking around attacking everyone, taking prisoners, etc.  The crew just plays the victim over and over.  Yelling, no no don't don't etc.  Then you notice they all have guns at their side the whole time, but never do they pull one out.  Arrrg!

And then many of the episodes themselves have just plain stupid themes.  By the time I got to season 2, I had started skipping episodes because they were just too stupid of a theme. Plus the whole ""we are in this together but we are going to constantly screw each other over every chance we get gets a bit old as well.  I also can't tell you how many times they get taken prisoner and have to be rescued.  probably 1/2 the episodes involve at least someone getting captured and needing to be rescued.

With each episode I watch it's gets more and more difficult to watch the next, and I'm a true blue sci-fi/fantasy fan watching tons of stuff that would be considered b movies at best.

All and all, I just don't recommend it.",1376524800,3,2047,4.445040214477212

The best that I could figure out was this was the reason for the movie, because, truthfully, the script was terribly written, the action was stale, the acting was, well, horrible.

They didn't have a zero (0) or negative one (-1) to rate it so I gave it the high score of ONE.

I guess you could probably watch this, if there was a Nuclear Holocaust and this was the last movie that was available. But, maybe only then. Watching the grass grow might be a better use of your time, or gathering nuts to eat...",1375574400,,634,4.319327731092437

You're thrown into the situation with aliens in another part of the galaxy with no warning, just like Chricton, and you have to puzzle out what's going on along the way.

This series was cut short when the storyline, the characters and the action was reaching a dramatic climax; wars, betrayals, budding romances, forgiveness, and the promise of cliffhangers, leaving the fans begging and longing for more.  Had it not been for the fans, their websites, chat-rooms and pleadings; when the series ended, the last scene would have left us wondering for years to come. Thankfully, as a devoted fan, the makers of Farscape didn't leave its fans wondering for long.  Like so many other programs, whose series end, without a proper ending, the same can not be said in this case. With the release of ""The Peacekeeper Wars""  this Farscape movie gave the fans what they longed for.  A sorrowful ending for some of the characters, and happy endings for others.",1374969600,,910,4.9605263157894735

Every alien concept is quite original and obviously has a background story which does not immediately reveal itself, but influences the events in the show directly.

I've since given it a better shot, and I wish I would have a long time ago. I'm through the second season, and I have found a universe(in lore and background) that is everybit as rich and developed as what I see in ST/B5.

1718362,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape appeals to a certain type of Sci-Fi fan base that includes me.  It's a combination adventure/fantasy with a measure of philosophy and a dash of ""will they or won't they -- of course they will eventually but we'll make them work for it"" romance between two of the main characters. The puppetry is nicely blended with the live characters to enhance the illusion.  The stories are strong enough that you don't find yourself looking for the seams in the costumes and sets.  There's a strong undercurrent of ""people are people"" and they deserve rights and respect whether they're human, alien, or whatever.  The series lasted long enough to migrate through a number of plot and character adjustments to keep it fresh.  Season one settled quickly into an enjoyable storyline with good acting and interesting twists.",1372550400,,818,4.985294117647059

Although the main character goes get a little annoying at times, I have to say that I have been enjoying this show very much from the moment I started watching it. It has interesting characters, a compelling story, and has really captured my attention as a quality sci-fi show.

I had read that the first season of the show wasn't that great, but I have to disagree. I think the characters are interesting, the pacing is very good overall, and the stories of individual episodes as well as the overarching storyline are very engaging.

1718391,5,B000067IVT,"Of the post-Star Trek TNG sci-fi series, Farscape is an enduring favorite that got cancelled mid-cliffhanger.  (I'm just a little bitter about that.) I gave it 5 stars because I just love it, but maybe should have given it 4 because it's not perfect. Sometimes the character John Crichton gets a bit hokey (how many Earth/US pop-culture references can I make in an episode kinda thing). But you gotta forgive the guy since he is, after all, a very long way from home and has no local cultural references to draw from. Eventually, he does start using the local slang, which is a good thing, but he sticks with the ""Earthican"" shtick too.

The characters from Jim Henson's Creature Shop--Pilot and Rygel--are wonderful. While sometimes the primary characters can be a bit two-dimensional,  they do have some appreciable depth to them. And the tensions are mounted well--we get to see them develop, with the exception of the initial conflict,  of course, in which Crais hunts Crichton for (accidentally) killing his brother.

Overall, the cast of characters is well balanced and not static in their hero or villain roles. The sets/visuals are beautiful and engrossing, which, for me, is important as it creates the reality Crichton has found himself in and allows the viewer to totally suspend disbelief.

Finally, the idea of ""translator microbes"" is probably one of the best up-front ways of dealing with obvious language differences in any sci-fi program I've seen. I'm so glad it's addressed here because everyone on the far side of the universe just happening to speak English would ruin that whole suspension of disbelief thing I mentioned earlier.",1371945600,,1651,5.007299270072993

Going back to the beginning has turned out to be a long delayed but wonderful treat. It is very much like visiting old friends. I am watching the show now with my boys, almost as fun as a campfire and more convenient by far.
I situations the group has to overcome are interesting the choices made by the characters are unpredictable as they have very disparate goals. I am amazed by what they did with puppets but I cannot forget that the characters are in fact puppets, a little blockade to my full immersion into the shows world. I would be just as distracting to have the little and big people in costume so not a deal breaker by any means. I also have a bit of a problem with the tension building statements like we only have 30 microns till (some dire thing happens) then there is a five minute speech (goodbye, wish me luck, You remember the sequence don't you? Yes! The sequence is Red button,Turn knob, then push hard! I know! Oh of course you do!)

1718498,5,B000067IVT,"Not only was Farscape one of my all time favorite shows, it has been one of the best kept secrets of the Sci-fi genre.  It's no wonder that when NBC acquired the Scifi network and abruptly canceled Farscape that the outcry among the fans was so loud and long; NBC had no choice but to give them a mini-series on Sci-fi to provide the closure required to such a phenomenal show in 2005, nearly a year and a half after the show was canceled.

Filmed in Australia and conceived by Rockne S. O'Bannon and Brian Henson, Farscape used CGI, puppetry of the Henson Creature Shop and lots of special effects, and a large variety of make-up, making it an expensive show to produce per episode.  As a result, the entire first season was shot as the pilot.  The show was highly successful for four seasons, always having a cliff hanger season finale which made the fans hungry for more.  Farscape developed an audience of highly devoted fans growing each year; not since Star Trek, has there been such a following.

John Crichton (Ben Browder) and his friend D.K. are conducting a ground breaking experiment to determine if a manned spacecraft can overcome atmospheric friction and exponentially increase its speed using only a planet's gravitational pull to propel a ship further into space; creating the first concrete step toward interstellar travel, if successful.  During the experiment an electromagnetic wave appears and opens a wormhole that John accidentally travels through.  He ends up in the middle of a battle in space, completely oblivious to what is actually going on around him, when a ship clips his module and crashes.  Suddenly his module is being maneuvered onto an extremely huge ship whose control he cannot break.

Once aboard, John is forced, by small maintenance robots (Diagnostic Repair Drones) to join the crew, in their frantic attempt to escape their attackers.  Members of the crew attempt to speak to John, but naturally, he doesn't understand, until a DRD painfully inserts something in his foot; a translator microbe that colonizes at the base of the brain to allow each of the aliens (and John) to understand one another.

It turns out that John was brought aboard because, to them, his ship appeared out of nowhere, technology they were not familiar with and were hoping would help them to escape.

John, in his confusion, learns that he is aboard a bio-mechinoid (living) prison ship, a Leviathan named (Moya), whose only weapon of defense is a technique called starburst, that causes the ship to disappear into a blinding flash of light to teleport to another location.  The ship has three very unique prisoners;

General Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) a Luxan warrior,
Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan (Virginia Hey), a beautiful Delvian priestess and
Dominar Rygel the XVI (the voice of Jonathan Hardy) a Hynerian ruler of over 600 billion, deposed from his throne, exiled and imprisoned while he slept.

Add to the crew one of their attackers, Officer Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), a violent Sebacean Peace Keeper soldier that happens to look human and you get the start of an interesting show.

The pilot of the ship that clipped John on his arrival belonged to the brother of Captain Bialar Crais (Lani Tupu, also the voice of Moya's pilot), the commander of the Peace Keeper ship that was attacking Moya; who does not care or believe that the accident was an accident and vows to kill John to avenge his brother's death.  When Aeryn tries to vouch for John, saying that she does not believe him to be brave enough or smart enough to have attacked Crais' brother or any other Peace Keeper, she is deemed irreversibly contaminated, a crime punishable by death.

The ship's crew are strangers that must rely on one another for their survival, not sure if they can trust one another and reluctant to remain together while having nowhere else to go.

The result is a never ending escapade of Crichton and the rest of the crew running for their lives and being doggedly pursued by the Peace Keepers and an array of other aliens into the uncharted territories.

As the ship's crew travels through space trying to avoid the Peace Keepers they find themselves dealing with problem after problem and for some reason, none of their plans ever works; at least not the way they plan them.

The crew of Moya develops a reputation so infamous that they not only are becoming well known throughout the galaxy, they begin drawing the attention of many other powerful Peace Keeper commanders and other alien species.  Moya's crew struggles with the reality that as the number of pursuers of her crew increases, so does the body count attributed to them.  All the while, Crichton, the subject of experiments and alien tortures, struggles to successfully to hold on to what is left of his sanity, as he searches for a way home through the use of wormhole technology he, at first, is unaware he has been gifted and doesn't know how to use.

For various reasons they acquire new crew members that are also misfits who cleverly fit into their Jerry Springer type family (John's description) and help to both muck up and save the day.

Farscape was a smart, funny, well written, funny, fun and completely action packed show.  One of the things that continue to make Farscape such a successful program is that rarely, if ever, did the writers insult the viewer's intelligence and the viewer is nearly always given a reasonable explanation why a condition exists or happens.  Even now, having been off the air since 2003, Farscape continues to acquire fans worldwide.",1370044800,,5550,4.825949367088608

It's a Jim Hesson production (The Muppets), so it has some puppet type characters.  I recommed it for it's story, I do enjoy watching it.  Don't try to compare it to todays syfy standard.",1370044800,,318,4.431034482758621

1718503,5,B000067IVT,I loved the whole concept of Farscape. I especially liked the episodes of season 1. They got off to a great start. Most were very original and very good. I was not as impressed unfortunately by some of the episodes of season 2.,1369958400,,227,4.3023255813953485

1718518,5,B000067IVT,Fun adventure. Original writing. Must watch the whole series to reap the context. The variety of characters is refreshingly unique. A must watch,1369785600,,144,5.304347826086956

1718520,5,B000067IVT,Farscape is one of those too short lived series. It was a great fantastical trip with John and the Crew. It evolved and matured so well throughout it's run.,1369526400,,156,4.413793103448276

1718571,5,B000067IVT,I enjoy this genre and knew this show from a while ago. It's fun in its interactions between the main characters,1368921600,,112,4.380952380952381
1718572,4,B000067IVT,I thoroughly enjoyed the first season. There is an interesting tension between hokey sic-fi and dark themes. I also find Henson's puppets a strange mixture of cuddliness and freakishness.,1368921600,,187,5.482758620689655

1718577,5,B000067IVT,"I was wandering through the Amazon library of streaming videos and came across one of my favorite sci-fi programs from the 1990's, Farscape. I sat down and started watching the pilot series (for those who watch and know Farscape, sorry for the pun), now 15 years later, and was still sucked in by the plot, characters and cinematography. I thought that I would probably be bored with the program, being that the graphics in most 1990's flicks no way compare to what we have in 2013. I was wrong. The graphics look like they could have just been created yesterday. And the plots equally are as fresh as anything currently on TV or at the movies. Within a week, I finished the whole first season (probably should have been doing some work instead). If you like a well-written, well acted out sci-fi program, then Farscape is the series for you.",1368748800,,842,4.62

1718599,3,B000067IVT,"I am a huge fan of space scifi (star wars, Star Trek, firefly, etc.) and this show certainly belongs in my collection. It is interesting and fun to watch and there is good character development. My only complaint is the image quality is not too great. It seems to be a little blurry (star trek Enterprise season 1 was like this too) and not the pristine quality that one expects from bluray. It is however still better than DVD, but I think it could have been transferred better. But most people don't watch this type of show only for the image quality, it's the story that counts here. And this show has some fantastic stories.",1368662400,,628,4.469565217391304

1718635,4,B000067IVT,"Although some of the effects on Farscape are a little dated....it is more than 10 years old, after all....the plots and characterization are actually quite good.  I missed this show completely when it was on originally, so it's a real treat to catch up with it on Amazon Prime.  By the way, Amazon pulled the show from it's free rotation a few months ago, which made a number of people (myself included) very unhappy.  They apparently got the message though, because it is now back on Amazon Prime.  At least it's nice to see that Amazon listens to its customers.",1368144000,,563,4.6

Some of the acting could've been more polished and a few of the episodes better written, but overall it still beats many of the productions coming out of the Sy-Fi channel.

Farscape had a great premise & exciting potential but suffered from poor quality control.  One of my peeves is the lack of true continuity between episodes.  I imagine, the producers wanted each episode to stand alone - but it made the show less engaging and compelling...",1368144000,,564,4.783505154639175

A puppet, a blue woman, a lost astronaut, a man with tentacles? I was confused to say the least. But I kept watching and as the season went on I found myself drawn more and more into the series and the characters. Dare I say I felt like the characters felt on the ship, a part of a family. Never expected that. Cannot recommend highly enough.

1718687,5,B000067IVT,"This is the first Sci-fi program I can remember that uses a living being, (Moya), as a space ship.  The series begins when an astronaut testing a space ship for Cape Canaveral, is sucked into a worm hole.  At the other end of the worm hole he finds himself positioned between the battling space ships of the Peacekeepers, (a humanoid alien race), and a peacekeeper prisoner transport ship currently commandeered by it's escaped cargo.
Tractor-beamed aboard Moya, the astronaut John, is rudely stuck with a Universal Language injection, (allows for full instant understanding of different alien languages).  Moya's Spartan crew are understandably desperate for immediately employable weapons technology. Moya starbursts and they make their escape.  Circumstances develop as they visit other solar systems & planets where they trade for parts & supplies. The alien characters are appealing, well developed and have depth.
Parts of the story are reminiscent of the plots of the older Sci-fi shows created for television; with a strong blending of more up-to-date visual art capabilities.",1367193600,,1084,5.396449704142012

It makes the story line flow so much better without all those interruptions. Now with all 4 seasons available I see the whole story line progress over the years (seasons).  This story line had great legs and could have goon on for another 6 seasons of more easily.  Dam the ""bean -counters"" at the Science Fiction channel for cancelling production when they did. Since it was filmed for non-HD TV originally, it is presented here in its original 4:3 ratio not 16:9 which will leave black bars along the sides of you screen.

I am very glad they made a final show, The Peacekeeper Wars, to bring final closure. I still don't understand WHY they ended it. I never will.

Watch the first season and you'll be hooked like the rest of us Scapers.

1718819,1,B000067IVT,"Am I the only one who's watched farscape and thought it completely sucked?

I mean really, I gave it a shot, watched from season 1 to almost the end of season 2 and still it really really sucks!

I watched over a season of Battlestar Galactica and thought nearly the same exact thing, same thing with Stargate Universe... all really really bad science fiction shows

Let me start with Farscape as it's the freshest on my mind...

1. The show is far more emotional than it is logical...

I'll try to be more specific,

Every freaking time a single bloody asteroid hits moya, everybody goes up in arms with one another...

I feel dizzy just thinking about it...

It's like these people are constantly bipolar or something, one moment they're talking casually with eachother, the next their yelling pointing a gun every which way...

Now I know you're thinking, well that makes it interesting or, that makes it fun...

No!... NO!... that makes it chaotic, and I don't know about you but I have enough chaos in my life...

I feel like I'm babysitting some really obnoxious children when I watch this show...

2. SHUT UP CHRICHTON!

It's a really really bad sign in a show when

One of the main characters is in peril and you're actually HOPING they're dying for good, because it means you won't have to see them anymore...

I found happening with several of the characters but most of all was Chrichton, who obviously is not going to die... damn...

In one episode they're invaded by a sphere of sorts, which creates a caveman (devolved version of Chrichton) and a super EVOLVED version of chrichton. The evolved version of chrichton was smart, and logical, and I couldn't help but hope that the evolved chrichton would take the originals place... even though he soon turned evil... and of course was killed in the episode...

Chrichton is like a little boy that thinks he's really tough and really smart and because he THINKS he's really tough he chooses to fight with even the tallest and strongest of men... he just has NO clue where he is...

He's just annoying... he's trapped lightyears from earth with these muppets in space, and he starts calling them ""SPARKY"" and says stuff like ""Well it's no dominos, but it got here in under 30 minutes""...

in one scene one of the other main characters tells him ""I like you chrichton, but if I'm honest I'll admit, half the time I have no idea what you're talking about""

It gives me a bad taste just thinking about it... he's put so many product placements into this show it's embarrasing... really...

but more than the product placement is his apparent unawareness of how very different this universe is from his own.

He charges into missions on worlds with unkown weapons, unknown defenses, and unknown customs and mumbles some stupid one liner about how he's going to pick up something from taco bell on the way back.. absolute gun blazing moron...

3. Farscape is a sci-fi show

With less to no of the sci and tons of the fi...

Seriously, one of the best aspects of watching a science fiction show is knowing that many of the story concepts originated off of real scientific theories... be it on paralell dimensions, or wormholes, or time travel... whatever, it's atleast PARTLY based on a scientific theory...

Farscape steps away from any real science roots and journeys off into fantasy...

Which is fine...

But... if it's fantasy...

Then it's not reallly... a sci-fi show.... now is it?...

Honestly... those who have watched farscape... would it REALLY be THAT drastic a change, to think instead of a space ship they were flying around in... it were to be a large water vessel... and instead of having hinerians, you would find orks or gobblins?...

It's REALLY not that far a stretch... all that would need be changed are the settings and some of the terminology... outside that, hardly anything couldn't be worked into a LOTR world...

4. Unclear longterm goals

Ok, yes I know that each character has their own objective, such as Chrichton wanting to get back to earth, Drok needing to go home to see his son, and so on...

But... where are they actually GOING...

Maybe they mentioned it several episodes ago and I've just forgotten, but a map, or a graph or a status report would be really nice about now...

I mean... they ARE in motion... they ARE going somewhere... and since they're in the space ship, it's gotta be really fast...

Every episode I watch they're closer (presumably to getting there)...

There mission isn't to ""seek out new life and civilizations""

So where the freil are they going?...

and for that matter

5. Who the freil is in charge!?

Maybe this is nit picking but EVERY sci-fi show I can think of has SOMEONE who's in charge... the captain, the leader... the one that push comes to shove makes decisions for the whole of the group...

Maybe that's why everyone seems so confused and lost in this show...

Even the freaking peace keepers (the bad guys)

Have a chain of command... and every world they visit seems to have one too... SOME guy who's the head hauncho...

Once again, maybe they ellected someone episodes ago and I've just forgotten, but it'd be nice if every once and a while they just sat down and discussed what to do without the camera doing that stupid dizzy vomit inducing shake thing...

and another thing...

6. This show almost BEGS you to call it ""weird""...

I'm fine by that... I love weird... I love different... I think there's far too much repitition... but just cuz it's weird doesn't make it good... and it's sad, but it feels like that's really all this show has going for it...

Once again, the chaotic tone mixed with overly emotional dialogues and weird camera angles just made me feel like I was having a fever dream...

7. The characters never EVER felt comfortable... as I said I kept wanting them to die... maybe I hated the acting, maybe the writing, who knows...

They never locked into place...

All in all, a really bad show",1363478400,3,5955,4.654214559386973

What just happened with Farscape is unacceptable and is a new form of bait-and-switch in my opinion.  They also did this with Babylon 5 at the exact time.

I was about to start watching episode 3 of season 2 when it was no longer available as part of Prime.  If they wanted to make it pay-per-view, then it should be fine for new members, who sign up AFTER the show was removed from Prime, and for those that do NOT already have it in their watch list.

In this day and age, it's easy to see who added a TV series to their watch list and/or started watching it while it was free under Prime.  Every customer should be able to watch the complete series once started.  It wouldn't surprise me if this something initiated by the studios.

I called support and was told by one person that it'll be back on Prime as it should because the engineers were updating the system.  Then the next day, another service rep tells me that the series' streaming rotation had expired.  So what's the real story here???  If video is streamed on a rotation, then put an ""end date"" on the series and all free Prime content so we know how much time we have to watch it before it's removed.  The fact that there was no warning of any kind when Farscape and Babylon 5 were removed is total BS.

In the end, we, the customers who work hard for our $$$, get screwed.  Needless to say I'm pissed like others here and wanted to hit the 1 star but didn't want to completely disregard the show's entertainment value.

I buy tons of stuff on Amazon and have been a long time customer and this is my first time delving into the world of streaming video.  If this is how it's done elsewhere, i.e., Netflix and so on, then it's a complete con job.",1361664000,7,1777,4.228486646884273

But to add my two-cents: This is the most unique take on the sci-fi space/alien genre that I had ever seen before, and I have not seen anything as distinctive since.  The universe in which it takes place, the approach to creature effects, the pop-culture influences are all amazing.  This show is, in my opinion, the only successful blend of a voice from the present in a futuristic world, and we have Ben Browder's performance to thank for that.  I have fallen in love with Virginia Hey all over again as the peaceful, elegant and beautiful Zahn and the terrifyingly confident, sexy-yet-alien-yet-immature-yet-masterful, Chianna played by Gigi Edgely.  Perhaps my favorite is D'Argo by Anthony Simcoe because his character begins a bit monotone, but follows a tremendous and tempered development that is amazing to watch over time.

This is such a great series, anyone who enjoyed star trek will surely like some part of this show.  It is about space travel and aliens and it is awesome!  It has a little cheesiness at some points, but didn't star trek?  This show brought me through a tough time in my life, I used to get lost in it for hours, watching episode after episode.  I love the characters (Areryn, Chiana, and Zhaan are all easy on the eyes), they are all unique, and each one brings in a cool back story.

1719039,3,B000067IVT,"I have always loved science fiction, but sometimes the genre can be a bit overdone. I actually liked the main characters in this series better when they became part of the Stargate SG1 family, although at that juncture, Stargate had most likely reached its saturation point and the producers needed fresh blood in an attempt to rejuvenate and re-inspire its fanbase.

Perhaps I would need to watch more than the first few minutes in the initial episode of Farscape, but I tired quickly of outlandish characters reminiscent of the bar scene in Star Wars: Episode IV, A New Hope. (Incidentally, as everyone knows, that particular movie was re-subtitled only to legitimize the prequels. I enjoyed it only as a farcical, juvenile romp that Harrison Ford - and only he, Ford - used as an audition for later, more satisfying roles. I even think the Star Trek prequel, with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, was a better prequel to a better series.)

I get more enjoyment from such offbeat series in this genre as Firefly, which didn't attempt to outdo its competition with the most outlandish alien beings. I saw a few Farscape episodes during its run, as well as a few reruns after that. It has its moments, but not enough to entice me to purchase the DVDs. I'm just glad I watched it as an Instant Video.",1349913600,,1297,4.684210526315789

Having A-Prime to be able to watch my own mini marathon is something I'm looking forward to.
*not a spoiler really, but just in case -ALERT* In this episode there's new characters and a sense of the direction that the series is going to take.

I watched the 3+ hour long show on Amazon Instant Video and my first impression was ""they got to be kidding"".  So I watched it again being all US male I thought that the ladies of Farscape were intriguing.  Chiana, delicious, Ayern, ooh smoking in a dark quiet sort of way.  Secousu (sorry about the spelling), very hot.  Jool, made me drool, and of course Zahn, wow, what can I say.  Other than that, I thought that the character interplay was unique so I believe I watched the last episode/mini-movie about 10-times and decided I would find out more about this show that was made by son of a legend Jim Henson.  Brian Henson and his pals got together and allowed the actors to explore the characters and this is what resulted.
The bad guys and girls are totally vicious and malevolent.  The good guys pull out of the fire at the very last moments always and the show always has time to be sexy.  There are more push-up bras than at JC Penney's.  Aside from the obvious unlike Star Trek; you have a bunch of thieves, killers, ex-prisoners and maniacs on a living ship with a symbiotic pilot that becomes a target for every criminal in the galaxy.  Like I say a good mix of action, violence, good guy to the rescue with consequences and throw in a liberal amount of sexy and you have ""Not Your Mother's Star Trek!  Good stuff.

So let me assure you that the quality of the video in this streaming version, while not HD, was absolutely acceptable. We watched it on a 55"" screen with the 4:3 aspect ratio maintained. The picture looked crisp and we didn't notice any oddness in movements on the screen, which happens fairly often with streaming video.

As to the show itself, we'd never seen it and were pleasantly surprised. I particularly liked an exchange early on between the star, Ben Browder and Kent McCord, who played his father in this episode. It was touching, honest, and satisfying ... a very well crafted piece of dialogue.

Special effects were quite acceptable looking, certainly seeming to match the standards of Star Trek shows and Stargate. The characters introduced were an interesting mix, and were convincingly acted. As a big sci-fi fan, I'm not sure quite how I missed this for so long. I think at the time there was just so MUCH sci-fi on that the field of viewing was a bit crowded back then, and this one just didn't make our schedule.

Now there is very little sci-fi on, so we're delighted to be able to watch this at our leisure with our Prime membership.

DVD's, Season One:

The clean show with no commercials was really fun to watch.  Darko, the alien warrior; Aerin, the former Peacekeeper; the priestess Zann; and the pompous, arrogant, selfish Hinerian, Rigel.

Many of the creatures are made with Animatronics which is really fascinating and different to see, produced by the Jim Henson Company (Sesame Street, etc.).  Brian Henson, the producer on the show, gives a couple of programs, a ""making of"" where he explains why the Australian area was the best place to film.

Production Value:

They didn't know how to do a fight scene with gymnastics, or how do you shoot with a green screen and process shooting.  They had to make up new ways for all this.  The result is one of the best polished science fiction program, unique and new, so innovative a series as Far-Scape.

Brian gives a lot of kudos to the SyFy Channel in picking up the show.  The show ran for four seasons!

""Creative liberating, logistically tough,"" says Brian.

Episodes:

Yeah, I'll give you a list, but I want to say a few of my favorites.  All of the episodes deal with Captain Crace, who wants revenge against John Crichton for killing the captain's brother (it was an accident).

I liked the shows where the biomechanic ship Moya had her baby and how the ship was trying to give birth to a new ship with weapons.

Or another show where John mistakenly assumes Moya has abandoned him and ends up on a green planet full of men and women who are like the Native Americans of today and where the women pick their mates.

Another show introduced Scorpius, a real bad, juicy Nazi-like character.

1719064,3,B000067IVT,"Farscape was something I kept hearing about off and on but never really knew much about. The user reviews finally got to me so I thought I'd give it a go. At least the 1st season. I figured I'd better hedge my bet and I'm glad I did. I liked it but not as much as the real fans.

First off I need to say I am a fan of Firefly and the two are strikingly similar. But as Firefly debuted in 2002 and Farscape debuted in 1999 I have to give Farscape the nod for format. In both series you have a group of disparate renegades on the run from the powers that be. Each group has a religious person, a soldier type and a guy who thinks out of the box to get them through tense situations.

The production values are similar as well. Many/most scenes take place within the ship but the outdoor scenes between the two seem similar, even though Farscape is Australian and Firefly is....American(?). In the 3rd or 4th episode of Farscape, after the exposition has been established, the crew decide to take on a freight job to get enough moolah to keep going. This is the center of nearly every Firefly episode.

Some user reviews figure Farscape to be far and away the best TV Sci-Fi series ever. I've not seen the ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboots or ""Stargate"" reboots or some of the others so I can't really say. But as good as it might be, it didn't knock my socks off so I'll probably stop with the the viewing of the first season.",1307923200,,1421,4.2555555555555555
1719065,5,B000067IVT,"Yes, I picked up this dvd set because of the ADV trailer. I'm glad I did so. I like how there are only a pair of epasides on the each of the disc to keep the bitrate up. IIf I had to describe FARSCAPE, my answer would be a bizzare combination of Kermit-the-frog and the original STARWARS TRILOGY. All in all, ADV have done a nice job promoting FARSCAPE.",1304899200,,353,4.130434782608695
1719066,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape is an incredible show. I thought the season finale was great as it brings the characters closer together and makes them realize that they not only need each other for survival but that they are turning into a family of sorts, albeit a dysfunctional one at that. If you enjoy sci-fi you will enjoy this show.",1303862400,,316,4.56140350877193
1719087,3,B000067IVT,"I felt that it might be useful to give my brief opinion on Season 1 of Farscape. This is the only season that I have watched, so I cannot comment on the subsequent progression of the show. However, based on this season, it truly astounds me that other reviewers say things like ""arguably the best SF ever produced for television"" and so forth. I almost wonder if I was watching the same show as them.

But I will allow that maybe it gets better. The first season is very slow, and does not even become baseline interesting (for me) until maybe the latter third of its episodes. It took me well over a year to watch Season 1, because I lost interest early and only came back many months later because I was bored and did not have anything else on hand. It does get better with episodes like ""Nerve"" and ""Bone to be Wild"" and once the character Scorpius is introduced. Great? No, but decent.

Have you heard/read the premise for this show? An astronaut gets sucked by a wormhole to someplace else in the universe? Not a revolutionary concept, but okay. He finds himself in the middle of a jailbreak, surrounded by aliens? More like gets drunk and wakes up on the set of a much less witty version of the Muppet Show. I love the Muppets, but most of these feel more like puppets (the pilot being the exception). They are all on a living spaceship? More like they're all on a nice television set that we are repeatedly told is a living spaceship. Claudia Black's character is an alien? Yes, but she looks like a human, just with invisibly different physiology. I say all of these things not to insult this show, but to point out that it's not quite as actually exotic or fantastic as it sounds. Again, maybe in Season 2+ it does live up to its hype. But not in Season 1.

The most unique thing about this show is its incorporation of Henson creatures, i.e. basically sci-fi Muppets and imaginitive costume and makeup creations. A few of them are outstanding, such as the pilot, the menacing catlike ""DNA Mad Scientist"" character and a few others. But some of them are like Halloween costumes, or cheap puppets. So this show cannot sell itself as too terribly serious. Okay, but does it have lots of humor? Not from my perspective. Ben Browder's character is a wisecracking, pop-culture-referencing type, but that only goes so far. The acting is not anything too outstanding. Is the writing good? Occasionally, but for as much people talk about Farscape being unique or surprising, Season 1 at least feels like just another cliche-ridden, predictable sci-fi series. Probably great if you are a kid. I really mean that. But as an adult, it just feels flat.

I love science fiction television, including most of the Star Trek versions (maybe not Voyager). I adore Babylon 5 and Firefly, and have a lot of respect for Battlestar Galactica. I've watched all ten seasons of Stargate SG-1. Amongst all of those, Farscape is clearly at the bottom in my opinion. Now, there is no accounting for subjective tastes. But making a case for this show as one of the greatest in sci-fi television seems like unwarranted hyperbole to me. That is just my take.",1301529600,,3137,4.5964285714285715
1719088,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape is a weird beast. Rarely have I felt such a sense of culture shock watching something. The first couple of episodes are like Trek meets Mad Max, with the added novelty of naked nymphomaniac aliens. These things don't inspire confidence, especially to the uninitiated.

But Farscape is sneaky. It slams you with plot turns that you don't see coming, and suddenly becomes one of the most emotional, artfully-crafted series ever produced. You need to ease into the waters slowly, though.

One example is John Crichton: on the surface, he's a snarky Peter Parker-wannabe, insulting all the aliens around him with 90s pop culture references. Ben Browder's style of acting can easily be mistaken for wooden, especially in the first couple of episodes when all he does is crack wise. However, as the plot wears on, you learn to keep on your toes with Crichton, because he's a multifaceted hero. He doesn't react to things the way ""TV"" characters normally do, especially for this genre; this unpredictability makes him seem more human to a general viewer. Crichton is also effortlessly cool. He grows on you quick.

Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun is the glue which holds the story together. This chick can seriously emote. It's a basic Sci-Fi action girl role, but Black invests it with an untold amount of depth. One senses this transition early on; in the first few episodes, there's not much clockwork inside Aeryn and you can predict her story arc pretty handedly. Judging from the commentaries, I suspect the show producers didn't realize what kind of supernova actress had fallen into their hands. They expected to cast a token bombshell and ended up with a seasoned genre actor who's ""been around the block"", in a good way. I can't gush about Claudia enough, so I won't try.

So, in short: This quickly went from being one of my least-favorite sci-fi shows ever to one of my Top 3.",1296086400,2,1885,4.826625386996904
1719089,4,B000067IVT,"I really like this series. It has little in common with Star Trek (which I love), so there's more to ""discover."" The first season does more than standard character development. It maps out the basic theme, ideas, yada, and pulls you into the saga. Crichton (the only representative of the human species) is likable, but we already know him--we're human too. It's the ensemble cast that glows.

The main character, John Chricton is enough to ruin this series. Can't act and his character is dumb for a NASA scientist.

Admittedly, I've only watched the 1st 2 episodes, but so long as the main character is so bad, it feels like a waste of time.

Apart from the usual infantile scripts, there are going to be so many inconsistencies/holes in the scripts it'll drive me nuts. (For example, already the writers appear to forget that aliens need a translation device to communicate with each other. And that's just between the 1st and 2nd episode.)

1719109,5,B000067IVT,"From the very first episode onward, it's pretty obvious that ""Farscape: The Complete Season 1"" is no ordinary sci-fi story -- the characters are outlaws, the ship is alive, and distant galaxies are full of gloriously weird and grotesque Muppets. Fortunately, it's not just unusual but brilliant -- full of irreverent humor, strange alien species, heart-pounding action and eerie sci-fi.

IASA astronaut John Crichton is planning to slingshot his experimental craft, Farscape One, as a one-small-step into interstellar exploration. Instead, he gets thrown through a wormhole, and ends up drifting in a firefight between a vast living prison ship called Moya and the hypermilitaristic Peacekeepers. Obviously, he wants to go home, but isn't sure how.

So he begins a journey with a gang of escaped criminals -- the Delvian priestess Zhaan, the bombastic warrior D'Argo, deposed dominar Rygel, and the prickly, surly ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun, and the grafted-into-Moya Pilot. But his new shipmates aren't the only problem for Crichton.

Among their problems: shapeshifting space bugs, a mad scientist who decides to transform Aeryn, Peacekeeper bounties on their heads, an energy-sucking sorcerer, a planet of turnip-farming hippies, a primitive planet's power struggles, a cult of insane Delvians, a century-old Peacekeeper with some sadistic personal hobbies, an allergy-causing asteroid, and the unexpected pregnancy of their ship. Yes, Moya gets PREGNANT.

But the biggest problem is Crais, a vengeful Peacekeeper commander who is determined to revenge himself on Crichton for the death of his brother. And with the Scarran/Sebacean hybrid Scorpius, he may get the chance to obliterate Moya's crew.

Most first seasons of a great show are either utterly brilliant, or are a slow ramp-up to the brilliance that the show will have in the future. ""Farscape: The Complete Season 1"" actually manages to be both -- it introduces a pretty amazing universe, full of flying Muppets, squeaking insectile robots, Leviathans, and blue-skinned telepathic plant people. There are lots of overarcing storylines twined with clever, intricate one-off episodes and solid personal subplots (such as Zhaan's struggle with her darker self).

And the dialogue is appallingly awesome (""I'm sure your world has no force so ruthless, so disciplined."" ""Oh, we call them linebackers. Or serial killers, depends on if they're... professional or amateur""). Crichton in particular sprinkles his dialogue with fun pop culture references and quotables (""Out the door, turn left at the creature"") but everybody gets great lines (""Mother always said I was the best looking. That's why she had my older brothers banished"").

Ben Browder's Crichton is a thoroughly likable hero -- he seems a bit flaky and utterly fish-out-of-water, but he's also clever, selfless and kind. And while Aeryn is hard-nosed and cold at first, the awesome Claudia Black chips away her iciness and reveals her fears and insecurities. Virginia Hey is brilliant as the walking talking plant-priestess (""You're a VEGETABLE?"") whose serenity hides a terrible past, and Gigi Edgley and Anthony Simcoe give good performances as the rebellious Chiana and hotheaded Luxan warrior. And while Rygel and Pilot are technically played by Muppets, they are gloriously three-dimensional and expressive -- think Yoda, but better.

1719115,4,B000067IVT,"1998 ushered in a new type of sci-fi television show. This was a show that dared to explore character development and story arcs that would last for more than a few shows. It was also a time when the Jim Hensen Creature Shop came into its own on television instead of just in feature films. However for all of its innovation the series had some hit and miss episodes and several bumps in the road on the way to what it would become in future seasons.

Farscape is the story of John Crichton (Ben Browder) who has been sucked through a wormhole and into a different part of the galaxy where a war is raging between a group of fugitives who have stolen a living spaceship and the galactic Peacekeepers who are supposed to represent order. Through 22 episodes Crichton and his fellow travelers encounter new problems and races of aliens that must be dealt with.

If you are a fan you are familiar with the premise of the show so this review will focus on the box set released by ADV Films. The set released in a number of editions has been long out of print. This has created a seller's market that is finally stabilizing. I bought my set for over 300 dollars but now the price is around 150.00. The episodes are presented two per disc with both Dolby 2.0 and Dolby 5.1 sound. While the surrounds are impressive sometimes the soundfield overwhelms the dialogue making individual episodes hard to understand. The picture quality is superb and makeup and black levels come across almost perfectly.

The extras are a series of video profiles of individual characters and crew and are well worth watching. The commentaries on eight individual episodes are also well worth a listen. Because of its cost this is a box set designed more for fans than for casual watchers of the series but it is well worth seeking out.",1236556800,2,1808,4.556923076923077

This show has blown me away, I bought the season after catching a few minutes of the Peacekeeper Wars on a PBS replay, I turned it off immediately, and ordered the first season because I wanted to know and understand it all. I have now completed season 1 and now am wrapping up Season 2, 3 and 4 and the PK Wars are on the way.

This show captures you, I can not watch just one, I am forced to go on and on. I am furious that SCI-FI just up and cancelled such a succesful show simply over cost, that is when you cut back, have a flashback episode, limit and cut back, but do not up and cancel a show when you had a 5 year deal with them. Allowing a 5th season would have done wonders, but I guess SCI FI is happy with the nonsense original movies they keep launching.

Anyway if you have the time, make FARSCAPE one of your next purchases, just know once you do, you will be as hooked as I am.

He joins forces with a band of outlaw outcasts and they all together try to make a better life for themselves.  John, the astronaut, is ultimately trying to find his way back to Earth.

This time for FS there was no one willing to pick up the program and finish. The Hallmark Entertainment left a taste of ash in the mouth when they pulled the plug in the middle of the fourth season. For reasons unknown the Hallmark Entertainment company was able to gather the cast and crew to gather to make an attempt to complete the series.

I gave the show the benefit of the doubt and was rewarded. It is one of the few series I have watched that became better as it progressed.  The show is definitely adult rated.  The humor can be sophisticated.  The characters are very well developed.  The plot has numerous twists and a few surprises.  The contrivance of an alien language for four-letter words was entertaining.  This is not a kids show by any means.  This is serious sci-fi.  If you are a true sci-fi fan then you owe it to yourself to check out this series.  I believe that you will be pleasantly surprised.  I like the show so well I have addd it to my personal library.  It sits there next to Firefly and Babylon 5.  Yeah, I liked Star Trek too, but I was never a Trekkie.

This is not a nice, ordered universe but one in which anything might and probably will happen.  The show also achieves something rarely accomplished in the Science Fiction TV arena - being sexy without coming across as completely contrived (the new Battlestar Galactica reeks of this poison).  An exceptional cast of mostly Australians give performances that are unforgetable.  Anthony Simcoe's character (Kar'Dargo) takes risks that most actors would flee screaming from.  Gigi Edgley gives an amazing performance as Chianna (comes in later in season one) which is unlike anything I have ever seen!  Virginia Hey as Zhan portrays a character which is probably one of the most unique spiritual characters ever put to film.  And of course the chemistry between exceptional actors Claudia Black and Ben Browder lights up the set!  This is a show that will move you on many levels.  Good on ya mate!

1719157,5,B000067IVT,"A very generous friend purchased the first season of ""Farscape"" for my birthday, knowing that I had never caught it during its run on television. After purchasing the rest on special at the local DVD store, I had the advantage of watching the entire series in a relatively short period of time (I averaged about two episodes a night), as one epic mega-movie.

John Crichton is an astronaut/scientist who sets off on a space-mission that involves using the Earth's gravitational pull as a type of slingshot into outer space (or something like that). During the experiment Crichton is catapulted through a wormhole and into a far distant part of the galaxy, smack-dab in the middle of a prison escape. Three dangerous alien criminals have taken over their prison-vessel and are being pursued by the galaxy's military arm: the Peacekeepers. After accidentally causing the death of the Peacekeeper Captain Crais's brother, Crichton falls in with the convicts on board their ship: an organic and sentient vessel known as Moya. Moya is piloted by a forth alien aptly named ""Pilot,"" who acts as mediator between ship and crew, and who is complicit in her rejection of the Peacekeeper control collar.

 Ironically, these escaped prisoners are Crichton's best chance for survival in this strange new world. They include the warrior D'Argo, the mystical priestess Zhaan, and the dispossessed monarch Rygel, each with their own mysterious back-stories centered on the crimes that originally landed them in custody. Seeing no other alternative, they grudgingly admit Crichton into their crew. But also on board is Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun, exiled after she deemed contaminated by extended exposure to the convicts. With nowhere else to go, she remains aboard Moya.

Now she's wanted along with the rest of the crew, a pursuit that is expounded by Crais's desire for vengeance against the man who ""murdered"" his brother. With single-minded intensity Crais hunts the fugitives across uncharted space, much akin to Captain Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick (a fitting analogy considering Moya, like the famous white whale, is known as a ""leviathan""). This motley crew is forced to work together in order to survive, evade the law, and adapt to the living conditions in a ship that is alive, conscious, and infinitely mysterious - such interactions make up the emotional backbone of the show.

The first three-quarters of Farscape's first season are rather episodic. No episode impinges on the next, and the events therein are so self-contained that they are often never again mentioned by characters after they occur. Without the presence of a strong story-arc, it does initially feel a little random at times. However, toward the end of the season things become a little clearer. Plots are tighter and the stakes are raised, particularly in the two-part special ""Nerve"" and ""The Hidden Memory."" By this stage the consequences of crucial events are carried on from one episode to the next, and reoccurring characters help to make us feel as though we're watching an unfolding multi-part story rather than a series of singular episodes that are constantly being clean-slated.

Before the plotting and characterization really begins to take off, the show's biggest draw-card is its stunning visual style. Designers utilize full-body prosthetics and make-up, expansive sets, gorgeous costumes, elaborate puppetry (courtesy of the Jim Henson Company) and surprisingly sophisticated CGI to make ""Farscape"" a feast for the eyes. From the organic halls of Moya to the starscapes of the galaxy, from the hours that the actors must have endured in order to don their costumes, to the expressive mannerisms of Rygel (who you soon forget is a puppet and regard as a fully-realized character), everything is crafted with an incredible eye for detail.

This is especially true of the cast of colorful characters that make up the main cast. Ben Browser plays Crichton as a surprisingly easy-going astronaut who relies on a constant stream of pop-culture references to keep his sanity intact. He's the typical all-American hero, a personality in stark contrast to Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun, the exiled Peacekeeper who also has to cope with a new life completely removed from all that she's known. Efficient, intolerant and droll, she ends up being the funniest character of the season what with her increasing exasperation with her surroundings.

D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) is the typical proud, brash warrior, with elaborate facial accruements and a volatile temper, and yet is allowed to display on several occasions both a gentle side and a sense of humor, whereas Virginia Hey endures blue body-paint as an alien priestess whose calm and wise exterior hides a darker side to her personality. This core cast is joined later in the game by Chiana (Gigi Edgley), a devious little fiend who would like nothing better than to rob them all blind, but whose sense of fun keeps her hanging around the one ship that's guaranteed to get her into trouble.

At first glance, each would seem to be basic archetypes (the stoic warrior, the mystic, the trickster, etc) but the actors are talented enough to bypass any initial clichs, and the writers soon follow up with stories that delve into each character's past. In such a large ensemble cast, it's easy to pick a favorite character and watch their development unfold.

The first season of ""Farscape"" is all about the actors, writers and audience settling into the show. With viewer's interest piqued, it's a strong base upon which to build bigger, richer stories and to expand on the characters and world that is already well-established by the finale. Ending on something of a cliff-hanger, the season as a whole is entertaining, imaginative, exciting, amusing, visually splendid, and a promising start to a strong story arc and a great show.",1149465600,,5850,5.122641509433962

1719160,3,B000067IVT,"I didn't watch this series when it ran on TV, but heard about it first here in Amazon reviews. Since it had so many loyal  fans, I decided to give it a try. I'd have to say I was somewhat disappointed - it's not bad, but it's not great either.

What I liked:

I thought two of the female characters, Zhaan and Aeryn were well done and intriguing. I liked Zhaan best early in the season when she was still a priest and could be counted on for wisdom, morality and a sense of mystery. Later, she became just another character, only blue. Aeryn is tough but vulnerable, always an appealing combination, and the chemistry between her and John works well. Chiana, another female character introduced later in the season, ALMOST works, but they couldn't seem to quite settle on just what kind of character she was supposed to be. Maybe that got worked out in later seasons.

What I didn't like:

In one word: Crichton. John Crichton is supposed to be a highly intelligent scientist/astronaut. So why does he so often look and act like a dumb jock? To recreate his most characteristic facial expression, do this: Open you mouth slightly. Now, direct your gaze upward and lower your eyelids to half-mast. Get the picture? He looks dumb, or sleepy, or maybe dumb AND sleepy. Since he is the main character, this is a major problem for me.

Some of the episodes seemed as though different parts were written by different writers, with little communication between them. For example, in one episode, John is sent off on an urgent  planetside errand to obtain an emergency medical supply for the ship, which is a biological entity. He ambles around with no apparent sense of urgency, meeting the locals, eating meals with them, etc. Meanwhile, back on the ship, things become desperate and Zhaan has to mind-meld with the ship and share its almost unbearable pain. Seems like one set of writers had a storyline ""John shows his sense of wonder at meeting aliens"" while another set had ""Zhaan shows her priestly powers and empathy"" but they forgot the two storylines were supposed to be one story.

It is not unusual for the first season of series to be a little rough. Writers often need time to see what works, and iron out the details of the characters, relationships, and chemistries. With that in mind, I think the show has possibilities, and maybe the subsequent seasons improved on the first. So far, though, I haven't felt inclined to shell out for season two.",1130630400,12,2454,4.664351851851852

The reason the first season as well as the first four episodes of the second season are the only ""season"" worth watching is because it is the only time the plot was good.  Only the John/Aeryn relationship was covered in detail, although clues were dropped about other relationships and their repercussions.  Sadly, early in the second season, it became ""who's screwing who"" in the Uncharted Territories.

was a small irritation in the programing where two or three of the disks did not want to start when I selected ""start movie""

The characters are fantastic, esp. Ben Browder's John Crichton. Some lead characters in a series like this will tend to be overpowered by supporting characters, but John really is the heart of the show. I loved his relationships with Aeryn, Rygel, and D'argo. And this show succeeded in doing something that normally ticks me off: introducing a major character later in the season (Chiana). It didn't work in Roswell, but Chiana manages to endear herself quickly in a way that Tess never did.

Also, puppets rule! As a kid of the 80s, I was reared on muppet sci-fi and this show upholds the legacy of films like the OT Star Wars, etc. Rygel and Pilot are sublime.

Crichtons unique situation of being the only Earthling amongst a galaxy of aliens creates some interesting word play at times that would not be funny in any other situation.

1719168,5,B000067IVT,"Too much to say, and sadly, not matter how flowery or refined my words will try to be, they will never do justice to the greatness of this show.

I'm a recent addition to the 'Scapers' movement, meaning that unfortunately, while the series was on Sci-fi, I was unable to watch it. Mostly because I was away in College, and their cable package did not include the Sci-fi channel.  I always did hear good things about it, but I never got to see this beautifully done series.

I'm a lover of Sci-fi in general, and after having purchased the Babylon 5 series, I started looking around for other great Sci-fi series to buy.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw that Farscape was now available as box sets- I was jumping up and down in glee, when I realized I could watch the entire run of the series-another reason to love DVDS.

Needless to say, I bought the entire Farscape run in one swoop (It was probably the best half grand that I've ever spent). I also got the Peacekeeper wars.

The moment the first episode began to play, I was sucked immediately into the world of Farscape, I knew then, that I would never regret buying this series.  The quality of it was just so amazing, considering that it was a TV show. The characters were interesting and fluid, Rygel was just so freaking funny, I always forgot he was a puppet- the Henson company did a tremendous job on animating him and giving him a personality and character of his own.

And then, there was Claudia Black.  She captivates me like no other female character in Sci-fi has ever done.  Her eyes, her mannerisms, and the way she acts, Aeryn Sun is the archetype of the sci-fi female heroine.

I'm also, for the most part, a hopeless romantic, so the instant chemistry you see between Aeryn and John told me that this was going to be a Sci-fi romance for the ages.  They way the two actors play off each other makes you get involved in their struggle to understand each other, and their own initial denial to what they are both feeling is just so enticing.  The fact that Aeryn is a Sebacean, an alien who looks a lot like a human, makes their interaction all the more interesting.  She's a genetically bred warrior, a PeaceKeeper, who has been raised in a society where she only knows how to fight but not feel.  It must have been exasperating to John, trying to figure her out- no more so, when in one episode he asks her, ""what about compassion?""  It's not a surprise that there is no Sebacean word for compassion, as Aeryn tells him, and that she's never felt the feeling he's trying to describe.

So far, I've only completed season 1, but already I'm seeing how John's humanity is starting to affect Aeryn, and how maybe, they'll find that they aren't so different after all, and that love can cross all boundaries....

I'm sad that this show only had 4 seasons, and while I'm glad it got closure with the follow-up mini series, The Peacekeeper Wars, I do hope that they will make either a feature film, or somehow, someway, get funding for season 5.  It's been almost 2 years since it went off air, I think, but you never know, sometimes miracles do happen.  Although it's getting harder and harder to believe it will, since Ben Browder and Claudia Black are now working on Stargate Sg1 (another show I love, but it's not the same.)

Buy this series, if you have any love for sci-fi, you won't be disappointed.  Yes, the boxsets are expensive compared to other shows, but you know what? After seeing season 1, and hoping that by supporting Farscape with my wallet so that somehow Farscape comes back in some form or another, I would gladly pay the price ADV is asking.",1110240000,3,3638,4.4803030303030305
1719169,5,B000067IVT,"I ordered Farscape Season 1 in December 2003. Until recently, I had watched an episode here and an episode there, picking my favourites because I had watched the whole series on Space.  I loved the episodes, the extras are fabulous, but the cases are a bit of a nuisance.
I finally had the chance to watch the whole series marathon style, including a plan to watch the more recently purchased Seasons 2 and 3. I had waited on purpose until I would be able to purchase and watch the whole run.
Much to my dismay, I discovered that Disc 10, containing the two part episode Nerve and The Hidden Memory was damaged.  Nerve was fine but The Hidden Memory was completely unwatchable.
Imagine the horror!
I had stayed up way too late, watching Nerve, and on seeing ""To be continued..."" decided I could stay up just a bit longer but it was scrambled!!!!!
Since more than a year has elapsed, I guess Amazon will not be willing to replace it (at least I haven't found a way to do it) so now I'm going to have to spend even more than the $193.19 (total including tax - I bought it as soon as it came out) just to get this one, very crucial episode.

1719172,5,B000067IVT,"When Farscape premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1999, there was something about it that set it apart from other original shows that aired on the cable channel: it was good.  Working from conventions associated with Star Trek and Babylon 5, Farscape took leaps and steps beyond the grain by having vast production sets, amazing and imaginitive make up and effects, and superb writing.  As the series begins, we are introduced to astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder), whose experiment in wormhole technology sling shots him to the other side of the universe where he finds himself in the middle of an interstellar prison break.  Now, John is a passenger on board a living ship called Moya, and he finds himself allied with the convict alien beings on board including the warrior Dargo (Anthony Simcoe), a blue skinned priestess named Zhaan (Virginia Hey), and an exiled diminutive king named Rygel who is brought to life via Jim Henson's Creature Shop.  John is also the target of the Peacekeepers, a group of intergalactic, fascist cops who are similar to humans, and renegade Peacekeeper Aeryn (Claudia Black) is also a passenger on board Moya, as John finds himself inexplicably drawn to her.  Later on in the season, we are introduced to who would become Crichton's arch nemesis, the nefarious Scorpious (Wayne Pygram) who will do anything to get the wormhole technology that a whole war will develop over.  This is just skimming the surface of the series however, as there is much more to be had as revelations are abound, and the season finale will have you salivating for more.  All in all, the first season of Farscape marked the way sci-fi TV should be: intelligent, amusing, cerebral, and full of brilliant ideas.",1105142400,2,1723,4.9206896551724135

1719174,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape shares quite a bit with another cult inspiring hit TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Snappy dialogue.  Tons of pop culture references.  Tons of weird characters and make-up.  The biggest one, though, is that the over arching plots of this space opera are all character driven.

There's not an interchangeable character in the bunch, and they're not afraid to off their characters as they go along.  Two very notable deaths occur in season 3.

The first half season is very much like Buffy's first couple of seasons, spent trying to feel out the tone of the show and the way that the primary characters inter-relate.  By the end of season 1, they have it down pat and the last three seasons were the wildest TV serial ride ever.  I kid you not.

Writing, costumes, special effects, make-up, all are top notch.  Set design sometimes leave a little to be desired (a la you can see the wheels on some of Moya's sets to facilitate rolling them on and off the sound stage), but are still visually captivating.

All of the characters are intriguing.  Each has a distinct personality, and even if they're not likeable, (Rygel), they are unpredictable and edgy enough that you can't tear yourself away. If nothing else, though, watch it for the consistently superb Claudia Black (Aeryn Sun).  Her strong, understated performance is reminiscent of Bill Murray in Lost in Translation.  However, Ms. Black manages to keep up this mastery of her craft for pretty much four straigh seasons.  Unprecedetned, and unbelieveable.  You'll just have to watch and find out.

1719178,5,B000067IVT,"I remember seeing my first episode of ""Farscape"" - a Saturday afternoon re-run - and getting interested. Fortunately, the following week had the show on every night, and the next episode I saw was the excellent ""PK Tech Girl"" - and suddenly I was hooked on the story of lost astronaut/scientist John Crichton and his misfit companions aboard Moya. Right up to the point where the Sci-Fi Channel short-sightedly cancelled the show and it ended after 4 seasons on a major cliffhanger.

Season One is uneven, especially during the first half, while the writers and production team are trying to find the show's voice and direction. But even mediocre Farscape is better than most other shows at their best, and it becomes clear as the season progresses that (1) this show is not about the FX, the action, or any of the other things most SF shows are about - it's about the characters, who grow and change as time passes,(2) the production team are willing to take major risks with the sotorylines, which typically pays off handsomely, and (3) despite the focus on the characters, the production values are superb (acting, FX, all are absolutely top-notch.)

If you like character-driven SF, I can't recommend this enough. But be warned - you may get hooked, just like I did. If you do, you have a wild and enjoyable ride ahead of you... and watch out for the upcoming ""Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars"" miniseries on the Sci Fi Channel!",1094342400,5,1426,4.769230769230769

Well, that may or may not have been true, but when it became available on dvd, I felt I had no excuse. I originally checked this out from the library (because of the high price tag). But now? I own all four seasons on dvd!

Wow! What a great show this was. Start with season one and work your way through. You won't be sorry. There's everything -- great character-driven plots, special effects, more popcult references than MST3K, love & romance, sex, weird aliens, weird aliens  having sex, Beavis-worthy bodily functions humor and a wonderfully refreshing habit of not tying each episode up neatly with some sort of easily-attained morality lesson.

This is messy, realistic, wacky, sometimes heartbreaking/sometimes funny, sexy and always engaging science fiction.  Sure, there was a clunker or two (""Jeremiah Crichton"", I'm lookin' at you), but what TV show doesn't have one of those? For the most part Season One did exactly what it should have: set up the premise, introduced the characters, started to give some big chunks of overall plotting, and hooked you in and made you want more.

The Season One dvd's have loads of extras too. Lots of commentary and great audio and visual quality. Well worth the investment! Start now and know what's going on in time for the mini-series!",1093996800,4,1483,4.7734375

This ain't kiddie sci-fi.  This quirky, adult, complicated drama gleefully stomps on cliches. Multi-dimensional characters evolve and grow.  Plots that may seem familiar veer in tantalizing, sometimes uncomfortable directions, and skewed humor winds all through it!  The writing and acting flat out rock!

Great drama and great fun all rolled into one!  It made me laugh. And squirm.  And yell, ""What are you frellin' doing?"" at the TV!

1719182,5,B000067IVT,"Many people are apprehensive about investing in ""Farscape"" because of the Sci-Fi label attached to it. When in reality, ""Farscape"" is far from any type of Sci-Fi show you may have seen before. The critically acclaimed series that ran for four years on the Sci-Fi channel destroys all of the conventions of is predecessors, by driving the series through the characters instead of techno-babble. The grand irony of it all is that this approach ultimately doomed the series to cancellation for being too serialized. But through it's four season run, ""Farscape"" created a fiercely loyal following of fans. So much so, that when the announcement of it's cancellation by the Sci-Fi channel was made, fans banded together to purchase a full page add in ""Variety"" magazine ($$) to try and save the show. And it worked, at least to a certain extent.

""Farscape"" returns in October for a limited time with an eight-hour mini-series that will tie up most of the loose ends created by the abrupt end of the show.

If you are curious and wish to get familiar with the series before it airs, then this is a great place to start.

Ben Browder (Party Of Five) stars as protagonist John Crichton, an astronaut shot through a wormhole while testing his experimental spacecraft. He ends up in a far quadrant of the galaxy in league with a group of escaped prisoners. The subsequent relationships he forms, and they way these diverse characters interact are the heartbeat of the show. Browder is perfect as the flawed hero doing his best to cope as the fish out of water, and the range of emotion and humor he brings to the role creates an innovative approach to the genre. The chemistry between he and leading lady Claudia Black, as Officer Aren Sun, is unmistakable. The underlying love story between the two of them is the lifeblood of the series. The cast is rounded out by a wonderful group of Australian and British born actors (and even a few puppets) that are forced to fulfill their roles through layers of heavy make up and prosthetics, and each one does so flawlessly.

But don't be fooled by the special effects and the elaborate sets, this series boils down to simple character development. If you are even a fringe Sci-Fi fan, then you should really give this one a chance, because it truly is a great piece of television.",1092355200,5,2316,4.711111111111111

1719185,4,B000067IVT,"I first heard of ""Farscape"", ironically, just after it had been cancelled. There was such an overwhelming outcry over this, that I felt the series was worth taking a look at. So, I bought the entire first three seasons (yes, I'm impulsive that way) and I'm glad I did. The first season is surprisingly good, although it took me a while (still not quite there, actually) to get used to some of the characters. Almost immediately though, I fell for Ben Browder as John Crichton, not only because he is gorgeous, but because he is an amazing, amazing actor. Honestly, I can think of very few people who possesses the acting chops the way that this guy does. He just amazes me to no end. And so does Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun. The interaction between these two, and later on - Scorpius, is what drew me into the show.
As far as the episodes go, I really like them all (well, except for the bucket of dren that is ""Jeremiah Crichton"", but we won't speak of that) but of course there are some that stand out more than others. The first couple of episodes pretty much introduces the whole Farscape universe to the viewer and you spend a lot of time (or at least I did) being almost as confused as Crichton originally is. Then you start to get into it and before you know it, you're hooked. Favorites include ""The Flax"" (first signs of the Aeryn/Chrichton relationship, what's not to love?), ""A Human Reaction"" (Crichton is back on Earth... or is he?), ""Through The Looking Glass"" (amusing shifts in reality aboard Moya), the two-parter ""Nerve""/""The Hidden Memory"" (first encounter with Stark, much Crichton/Scorpius-banter and lovely buddy-buddy prison scenes) and the season finale ""Family Ties"" (when John cries, I cry, too).
There are flaws, such as it's not the easiest show to get into, and some of the characters, like I said, are a bit ... weird, for lack of a better word. But, still, I'm so glad I watched it because it is a ground-breaking and daring show that is willing not only to take risks and go the distance (which becomes even more evident in seasons two and three) but it's also quite the emotional rollercoaster. And I love that. I'm sure you will, too. Go on, take a chanse.",1088640000,5,2189,4.572519083969466
1719186,4,B000067IVT,"First, a bit about me, I'm 26, I really enjoy sci-fi but I am no longer avid. (I was a huge Trekker at the time of ST:TNG) Now I primarily concern myself with entertainment that has quality story, quality acting, etc and if it happens to be in a sci-fi setting, all the better, for I know the potential. I bought this DVD set not having watched a single episode of Farscape before. I was going purely on the reviews here at amazon. If you read them you will find a plethora of 5 star ratings and a few that say this is absolute garbage. Here's why: the first few episodes are nearly unwatchable for those with a discriminating taste, although I can understand how, someone who eats up almost all the sci-fi that television has to offer, could love everything in season one for its freshness and creativity. As for me, I was thoroughly convinced I had bought a dud as nearly all of the first half of this season has moments of weak direction (the fight scenes specifically), weak story, weak acting, and weak dialogue. But just as I was about to crush my own head with a cinder block for paying $150 for this set, I watched the episode DNA Mad Scientist, and I realized that the weaknesses had slowed or even disappeared, and that without them, this was some quality science fiction. Although there were still some shakey episodes to come, there were also some flawless ones. When this show works it really works. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for ST:TNG, but I have to say that Farscape has even more potential and has some episodes that rival TNG for quality even in season one. By the end of the season I was already wishing I had season 2, as it seemed they were pumping out quality episodes consistently. All facets of the show had improved, the acting was seamless, the writing was intelligent, nothing detracted you from being immersed by the story and believing the characters. That being said, I'm not a fan of the occasional sexual immorality that is included in some episodes.
Overall, the creativity and the boldness to go where no Star Trek episode has gone before actually does make this show a must-see for any sci-fi fan, as many of the reviews say. If future seasons are full of episodes like the good ones of season one, then I would give them 5 stars, but as this season, as a whole, is very hit and miss, I can only give it a 4, even that's a bit generous. Season 1 has five star moments, nearly all of the last half, but when it's bad, it's really bad.
As for whether you should buy this set, you have to decide whether $150 is worth spending for a season where the show is only finding its legs. I dare say that for some people, the steep price will be worth it, hopefully my review will help you determine if you are one of them.
Some other reviews here that are pretty accurate IMO are the ones by: Scott Wance, a customer from vancouver and a customer from BC.",1087776000,7,2895,4.3729128014842304
1719187,3,B000067IVT,"Let me dispense with a few negative comments, and then finish with compliments.
1) They used Fox studios in Australia.  If I'd known that Fox had any part in the making tof this film then I wouldn't have bought it.  Fox's politics are reprehensible, and giving them money is a way of rewarding bad behavior.
2) Ads.  On several of the DVDs in this set, one is launched AUTOMATICALLY into advertisements for non-Farscape crap, as the DVD launches.  Pushy advertising, on something WE PAID TO SEE, is 100% unacceptable.  On this basis alone, I won't be buying any more in this series, if this is what they do on later DVDs.
3) Sometimes the plots are a little ... unoriginal.  Elements like EVERY attractive woman flirting with Our Hero, and characters ALWAYS surviving their exploits, are a little tired.
4) Characters are too often bipedal, human-sized, human-lookin'.  One wishes that a SF series would embrace a higher standard of experimentation.
OK--- on to the compliments.
A) Refreshing dialogue, at times.  Our Hero is a slightly too-super, too-successful guy, but at least he's a normal guy thrust into a spectacular world, and able to SAY all the things that we SF fans would want to say-- ""Hey, he looks like Yoda !""  ""Shut up, Darth Vader Wannabe !""
B) Good special effects.  The DNA Mad Scientist, for example, has refolded legs that bear watching and re-watching...and the lip-synching done on The Pilot and Rigel are terrific. (Although, the sound company and the person who plays Rigel are not present in later seasons.  So, perhaps later seasons won't have this quality.  Drat.)
C)  Things EVOLVE.  One annoying aspect of almost any TV series is, things never change.  Episodes can be re-run in any order, with viewers never noticing a change.  FarScape, however, has broken free of this mode.  Episodes make regular references to events earlier on, characters evolve, plots evolve.  Main characters DO get added (and, I hope, subtracted).",1085616000,10,1955,4.926605504587156

1719190,5,B000067IVT,"Oh the irreverent humor! Oh those nasty Peackeepers. Luxans, Delvians, Hynerians - oh my! So much more than the bumpy heads of Star Trek. Gone is stick up the butt prime directive. Gone are the sterile environments of starships. Gone are the impeccable makeup and hair. Welcome to the rough and tumble jungle of the Uncharted territories. Farscape is pure space opera - a tale of a lost human astronaut who's tossed out of a wormhole right into the thick of a Peacekeeper battle. He gets picked up by a straggling crew of prisoners in a living ship called Moya. They get dirty. They get shot at, sliced, and tortured. They don't always do the right thing but they are survivors and fighters. Now this is real shoot em up nitty gritty space adventure!
Scientific and political proselytizing is fine, but every once in a while you just want pure entertainment. Farscape mixes the occasional sci-fi ""conundrum"" episodes with storylines that arc across seasons. Each character's personality is dynamic. Villains become allies. Allies may even betray each other. John Chrichton initially seemed too young and jockish. He remains goofy but becomes quite a compassionate and heroic character. He is what the captain of ""Enterprise"" should have been. The emotionally inept Aeryn Sun is the best badass sci-fi female hero on TV. Rigel ""Dominar of Hyneria"" - his witty repartees leave me in stitches. Zhaan - the Delvian priest - her ""secret"" was quite shocking! D'Argo I'd have to say is the weakest character - too irritable and not much of a warrior. They all flee the scene of the battle with a crazed vengeful Peacekeeper captain named Crais on their tails. Chiana, a prisoner of the brainwashing Nebaris is introduced in this first season. And last but not least - dear sweet Pilot. He is ET come alive. Henson & co have achieved a remarkable feat with these puppets - they ARE real. The cliffhanger introduces a cold calculating half-breed villain named Scorpios who has the best office chair outside of a dentist's office.

It is true that there is the occasional fart joke and base humor. They swear, they screw, and sometimes are plain insane. Some episodes verge on madness. The pop culture references will make you giggle. The costumes and alien settings are always immaculate. If you watched ST enough you'll realize that they use the same 5 landscapes for every world. In Farscape, you'll see: Bladerunner-esque cities, bars full of aliens like the Mos Eisley Cantina, a cemetery planet, even a mining colony inside a space creature's carcass. At last some new ideas on the same old tired space stations and antiseptic new age architecture! I can see why the Sci-fi channel couldn't keep funding it.

1719191,5,B000067IVT,"Though I can't say much about Stargate, nothing bad or good haven't seen it, I can say that this is by far the best sci fi series I have seen since Deep Space Nine.
In terms of quality it far surpasses most other shows right from the getgo.  Most shows will have a shaky first season, then pick up once they are allowed a bigger budget.  This one hit you with its high quality costumes and surreal imagery from the first episode.
The charaters are well balanced and interesting.  They are all former prisoners, and not all good people, but they all have a certain depth to them.  The noble but violent D'argo, the peaceful and sexual Zhan, the selfless Pilot, the arrogant and devious Rygel(my favorite), the emotionally challeged but fierce and competent Aeryn Sunn, the sometimes thick headed but innovative Crichton, and Chiana the classic preachers daughter(wild and willing to do anything).
The storylines were interesting and had an energy to them.  Aliens being some of the best in years, all had a surreal and organic quality to them.  Not like the sterile and too human Star Trek NG types.
The bad guys were threatening and had depth.  The Peacekeepers being a totalitarian millitary regime, remenicent of the Federation from Starship Troopers.  Supposedly supporting peace and order, but brutalizing and killing to achieve that and enforcing their ways on others.  The character Crais was excellent as the crazed general hunting down Crichton for allegedly killing his brother.  Scorpius in the later part of the series creates a classic villian, well spoken, cold, calculating, intelligent, mysterious, and ruthless when getting what he wants.  He isn't some screaming psychopath that rants and rages, he is a cool and collected baddie, which I find much more menacing.  His interrogation of Crichton was one of the creepier parts of the series.
This series has appealed to many types of people, including those who normally don't like sci fi.  Watch it, and you won't be dissapointed.",1082505600,9,1996,4.957957957957958

1719193,5,B000067IVT,"This DVD set is perplexing.  The television series FARSCAPE is one of the finest television shows of recent years, and is unquestionably one of the great Sci-Fi series in the history of television, joining a short list of shows such as the various Star Trek series, BABYLON FIVE, and FIREFLY.  Apart from the various design and technical problems that other reviewers have noted, it is very definitely not priced to own.  While comparable series--such as the BUFFY THE VAMPIRE and ANGEL sets--currently retail for $60, this set retails for $150! making it one of the most expensive series available anywhere.
I should dock the set a star for the cost and/or the poor design, but it is such a superb show that it is almost impossible to do so.  FARSCAPE comes across as STAR TREK: VOYAGER crossed with the pop cultural savvy of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  In some ways it is a very traditional Sci-Fi series in bringing together a group of humanoid aliens for a journey across space.  It is, however, unusual in the degree to which it makes the characters differ from one another.  For instance, on of the major characters is actually a plant-based life form, one humanoid is especially sensitive to heat, another has three stomachs, while all have significantly better eyesight than the lone human on the ship.  The ship itself is alive, helped made believable by having bonded with a pilot who can speak for the ship.  All of this stretches the Sci-Fi genre in new and interesting ways.  Only FIREFLY has surpassed it in breaking down traditional Sci-Fi conventions (e.g., by having no aliens at all).
The show in the first season is often flawed.  The acting isn't always the greatest (Ben Browder is appealing as John Crichton, but he is not Laurence Olivier), and I personally detest the puppet character Rygel (though the puppet Pilot is superbly done).  Although there is an overall arc, too often the show has a stand-alone feel to the episodes.  Inevitably in a show like this, where alien life forms constantly tax the powers of invention, some of the aliens are less than convincing.  Nonetheless, the sheer inventiveness and passion of the show's makers overcomes all lesser deficiencies.  Most of all the show succeeds because everyone involved is willing to take chances.
The first season introduces several of the major characters who will appear in the series as a whole, beginning with John Crichton, a human, an astronaut who accidentally enters a worm hole in an experimental early 21st century spacecraft and pops out in a completely different part of the universe.  He enters a living spaceship named Moya where he meets and eventually befriends (though only gradually) a warrior named D'Argo, a priestess named Zhaan, a flatulent toad-like dethroned emperor named Rygel, and the ships pilot.  They quite accidentally take on a Peacekeeper (they are the chief bad guys on the show) who is forced to join them named Aeryn Sun (played by the beautiful and talented Claudia Black).  Later in the season they shelter the catlike Chiana.  While the first season is not as good as the show would get in later seasons, it was by any standard a most auspicious beginning.
Anyone who loves Sci-Fi will love this.  I only hope that they bring out an affordable edition of this otherwise superb television show.",1080864000,7,3319,4.882352941176471
1719194,1,B000067IVT,"I had high expectations before I purchased this DVD Box Set as I had never watched a single episode. To set the tone for this review I must disclose that I am a huge Sci-Fi fan who has spent more than $1,000 on Sci-Fi DVDs & Videos. But to the set itself:
First, on the technical side it is not at all user friendly. Each DVD starts out with a commercial for some ridiculous cartoon and then you have to hit menu to bypass the commercial. Also, although there are generally 2 episodes per DVD the main menu does not allow you to select the 2nd one to play, you have to skip to the scene selection screen and tab down past all of the scenes from ep. 1 before you can click on the 2nd episode.
Regarding the content, the episodes are very erratic and slow moving. The characters are poorly written including the ""hulking warrior"" D'Argo. D'Argo is the most inept warroior to ever grace the screen and reminded me of the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz. Every punch he throws in season one misses, every time he uses his sword he misses, every time he fires his sword/gun he misses, and he gets himself captured almost in every episode. Very Lame! The main character, Ben Browder (John Cricton) can't act although the two women characters, Zhaan & Aereyn are OK. The best characters are the Jim Henson muppets by far!! Some of the shows are extremely slow moving and by the 3rd episode you ask out loud ""because 1 or 2 of the crew are down on a planet when are the rest going to have to follow them to get them out of trouble""? Each time the one trying to do the rescuing are bound to get in more trouble... It is too predictable!!
I suggest that if you want to save money that you watch the first episode and the last and see if Season 2 improves. Huge waste of time.",1080172800,11,1763,4.234421364985163

1719196,4,B000067IVT,"Overall, a great set of DVDs. There are 6 boxes, 2 DVDs per box, 2 episodes per disk. There are overall only 2 minor complaints that I have about this set:
1. The paper insert between the DVDs is supposed to be something...but I can't figure out exactly what it is. Looks cheap, feels cheap, doesn't do anything.
2. I do feel that track list for each episode could be better. There are only 4 tracks per each 1 hour episode, and you can not skip the opening credits (which I found very convinient on other DVD sets like Simpsons) with ""Next Track"" button...but you can always fastforward through them.
Otherwise, a great purchase.
P.S. One of the reviewers said that they were forced to watch ADV previews every time a disk was put in......never seen it happen. I have to sit through the obligatory FBI warning, but then I can skip right to DVD menu.",1078790400,5,850,4.455128205128205

ADV has produced one of the worst DVD's I have unfortunately ever owned.
You are forced to watch ADV's previews every time you put a disk in your player.  This may be player specific but, my player will not let me advance throught the previews to get to the show.  I think it is a DVD mastering trick to force you to watch the previews.  I don't know about you but I don't want to watch ADV's comercials on somthing I just payed for.

1719200,3,B000067IVT,"The only reason I bought the dvd of this show is because I really enjoyed what I had seen on SciFi channel, but was confused about the plot lines due to seeing only 10-12 episodes and seeing them all out of sequence.  The original show is very well done, but the editing of the dvd wasn't up to the price being asked for it.  The transitions where the commercials were in the tv show are glaringly obvious, and detract from the flow of the story.  The extra material is redundant from one dvd to the next.  The same clips are used over and over and over again, so that I stopped watching the extra material in the middle of the third dvd.  I felt a little cheated by paying so much for a product which seemed thrown together, rather than crafted into a coherent whole.  I saw the first 4 seasons of SG-1 on dvd recently and felt that they had done a far better job of creating a good product for viewers.

Certainly, I wouldn't shell out a hundred dollars a season for any other show, but the alternative would be watching my favorite show on the the channel that killed it.

The quality of the picture and sound on these DVDs is excellent. The series is intelligent and provacative. We highly recommend you buy these since unfortunately the series was cancelled by the SciFi channel.

The stories are fresh and very different from any series I have followed before. I have also noticed that women and men alike seem to be intrigued by this series. Unlike some SciFi series that had more appeal to men this one seems to be well rounded. I wouldn't say it is always polictically correct, after all in space the cultures you run across don't usually care about what our values are on Earth.

Any fans of movies like ""Blade Runner"", ""Dark Crystal"", or ""Heavy Metal"" should enjoy them. Great cast, direction, sound and music, and incredible production values make these more like movies than a TV series. I am not sure why the SciFi channel did not appreciate the following of fans this series has, but fortunately their lack of intelligence is not shared by those producing these wonderful DVDs.",1065571200,,1133,4.66

  Noted as the only watchable thing on the Sci-fi Channel (a station so bad you pray for commercials...SG-1, Tremors, Scare Tactics...you see what I mean) it was cancelled for some illogical reason at the conclusion of Season 4.  An immensely enjoyable show, you appreciate even more if you have the opportunity to see it from the very beginning.
  The characters grow on you, the plots are great, the dialoque is the best in television, and the special effects are both special and effective.  This is a Jim Henson production and it lives up to it's creators well deserved reputation for cutting edge puppetry and effects.  The only side effect of this series is that it renders you incapable of watching lesser material without a grimace.  For instance, I can't enjoy the Scott Bacula Star Trek show anymore.
  I need to warn you though, The series theme song is godawful (perhaps worse than the afore mentioned ST (stuff) ballad)but fortunately the ululating space sopranos diminish and disappear bu Season 3...you'll see what I mean.

Farscape is a truly amazing ride.  The characters, even the ones that are puppets from the Jim Henson Company's Creature Shop, have real depth and emotion (and that's saying something, for a puppet!) and quickly become real people to the viewer.  Farscape will engage your mind and your emotions.  You find yourself thinking about almost every episode for days afterward, and each time you re-watch an episode (and you WILL watch them again, trust me on this one) you will get something new out of the experience.

The cancellation of this show after only 4 seasons is a terrible injustice and will go on in history to reflect a period where people would rather watch degrading reality shows over creative and quality programming.,1049241600,2,488,5.1125
1719217,4,B000067IVT,"I remember my brother watching a few episodes of farscape and I would sit their and be fairly impressed with the show. Sadly I was one who could not devote my friday nights to watching a show but I knew I was missing out on something special. Thanks to TV on DVD I can make up for past mistakes. Watching this show is such a treat, not only are all the witty pop references hilarious, but the Jim Henson company have done wonders and truly show why they are still the best despite the wide use of CGI instead of electronics. It sorta makes you wonder why George Lucas didn't incorporate their talents for the new Star Wars movies. It's amazing that a show that was meant to be a showcase for Jim Henson Lmtd. turned out to have so much depth and emotion behind it's many cast of characters. I am not even halfway done with season 1 and I am in complete awe at it's instant character development. Everytime you THINK you have a character figured out something comes up that makes them more conflicted, complex, and far more interesting then they were before. It truly takes risks with it's material and plot twists. I am now a fan (far too late I'm afraid) but I do look forward to experiencing all 4 seasons thanks to the greatness of TV on DVD.
It's not just hype. This show was proof that TV doesn't have to be mindless reality shows or cliche family  sitcoms. If you're into Farscape I highly suggest Buffy the Vampire Slayer (has alot of character depth as well) or the X-Files. Two classic shows that are now very easily seen on DVD.",1049068800,4,1538,4.358885017421603
1719218,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape is doing for TV, what the original Star Wars did for movies back in 1977. Only it has an advantage over the movie, it is not limited to the 3 hour time constraint movies have. Believe me, Farscape uses every second for plot development and adding a richness to the characters rarely seen in both movies and TV.
Like Star Wars, Farscape combines humor, action, & drama with state of the art F/X and creatures (two of which are regular characters). The characterizations are so strong you will forget that Zhann is blue, D'Argo has tentacles, & Rygel is a puppet. Farscape's tends to leave you with a feeling that you just peaked into the characters' lives, as opposed to have just watched a scripted TV show.
While watching this box set, you will notice there is something right about Farscape. Over the course of the season, the characters grow from distrustful individuals to a functional team/family of sorts. Don't get me wrong, everyone on board the living ship has their own agenda, and one betrays the group at the beginning of the last episode ""Family Ties."" Season 1 slowly builds momentum then kicks into overdrive with episode 18 ""A Bug's Life."" The last five episodes will be difficult not to watch in one sitting. Whatever the creative forces behind Farscape tried to do, they definitely accomplished it!
If you never have seen Farscape and are hesitant by the price of this box set, I suggest getting the Best of Season 1 set (type B000067IVT in the search box) first. It contains 6 amazing episodes which are a great introduction to the series...you can always lend it out to friends later. Once you've experienced these episodes, you'll need the rest of the season & can order this box set then. Also keep in mind, Farscape is known for its cliffhanger season finales, & season 1 began this tradition in an explosive way. So it would be a good idea to keep Season 2, Vol. 1 (type B000068TOM in the search box) ready to order in your shopping cart.",1048809600,47,1971,4.650429799426934

Problem 1) Lots of add junk before the menu comes up.  Each has it's own track, so you have to do a lot of skipping to get to the menu.
Problem 2) There are two episodes per DVD, but the menu doesn't let you go directly to the second episode.  You have to play and then skip through the first.
Problem 3) No subtitles.  If you're running sound through a stereo, not the TV and thus can't use CC, you're out of luck if you just don't get what that alien said....",1048204800,8,536,4.037735849056604
1719220,4,B000067IVT,"Not having cable or satellite, I had only watched Farscape a few times when I was at a friend's or relative's house (normally after watching an episode of Stargate SG-1).  I always thought of the show as weak, with the ""muppet"" characters as a poor attempt (though at least SOME attempt) to have regular alien characters that weren't always humanoid.  But I kept on hearing people rave on and on about the show, so I figured this ""Best of"" set would be a way to get the background story, and see if I'd get hooked.
Good news:  This is a well thought out SF series (though be warned that I am only judging it from the first season.  I thought ""Earth: Final Conflict"" was great, and was saddened as it  consistently got worse season after season).  You do need some background to appreciate some of the subtleties of what actually is going on in later episodes, and this set will help you make sense of other episodes.  I do now plan to buy/rent later discs and follow the continuing storyline.
...
Bad news #2: The last episode in the set is a season ending cliffhanger (with the conclusion in the next season).  While this isn't the fault of the series, I would have preferred NOT to be not-so-subtly coerced into buying more discs.  Save that for the complete season sets, not for a ""Best of"" collection.
Bad news #3: This disc is not consistently captioned - some episodes have CC, others do not, and none are subtitled.  I read someone else's review of another Farscape set which said that subtitles WERE available via the DVD remote, but that is NOT the case here (believe me, I tried).  If you're deaf or hearing-impaired, this set may frustrate you.  And lip-reading isn't even a remote possibility when two of the main characters are puppets!
Bad news #4 (well, not bad but annoying):  Can somebody PLEASE produce a science fiction movie/series that DOESN'T take place at the ""other end of the..."" (universe, galaxy, dimensions, etc)?  Space is big, REALLY big, REALLY, REALLY big.  If someone went through a wormhole that took them into the galaxy CLOSEST to our Milky Way, that is going to be far enough away to convince the viewer that they aren't going home for awhile (hopefully at least for 5 seasons!).  Saying ""the other end of"" insults the intelligence of many of the viewers.  Remember, Gilligan got lost for years after only a three hour tour (and rumor has it that he was actually on a Hollywood soundstage for the entire series!).  :)
All that said, this IS a good set to watch if you feel the need to try it on for size to see if it fits your style of SF.  Even if you end up not buying any more, having only the ""Best of"" set will look more complete on your DVD shelf than having volumes 1,2 & 3 sitting there whispering at you to ""Buy volume 4... Buy volume 4..."".",1047340800,4,2787,4.483168316831684

However, the characters and the world they are in really grows on you. I am now approaching the very final two episodes of season one and feel a little bit sad to leave this little fictional universe. I am looking forward to the second season. It is a great show and if you love Sci-Fi I cannot see how you would not be drawn to this creative work. The only drawback with the series is that it is difficult to jump into (i.e. it is helpful to have followed the series). Even though many episodes are self-contained there are several story lines that connect the episodes. I personally first saw episodes from season 3 and was thoroughly confused. When I bought season one I got the opportunity to follow the buildup of the characters and the plot. I love this show and highly recommend it!

This is a very professionally done series, but, it is written for a younger audience. In my estimation, the writing and plot is geared for the young teen set: were I 12 years old again I would love this.
But now, in my advancing adulthood, the heavy soundtrack, the silly bodily-function quips, the one-dimensionality of the characters, just does not appeal.
A very good show, but not for adults

1719228,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape is the best show on TV. I recommend anyone who enjoys science fiction to buy the series. The combination of excellent writing and outstanding acting makes this show unique in today's world of uninspired action shows. All of the characters are well played, but my favorite is John Crichton. Ben Browder's portrayal is both poignant and funny. His comments and jokes add humor to otherwise tense situations, while his longing for home adds a touch we can all appreciate.",1042070400,5,477,4.975
1719229,4,B000067IVT,"Flung into a distant galaxy via a wormhole and thrown in with a bunch of ""criminals"" on a prison transport ship, John Crichton has suddenly crossed over to the borderland of insanity. He's in new territory never experienced by a human before. That's not to say that his primative spacecraft (a modified Space Shuttle)couldn't hold its own--Crichton's quite proud of his little ship and he should be because it's propelled us and him into the best written show on television.
It all happened one stormy evening in 1998 on, of all places, the sci-fi channel (yes, the same folks who cling to inept series like Crossing Over and that new ... dream interpretation program). This was when the channel actually had ambition. Between Dune and Farscape, Sci-Fi managed to trump all the networks. Not only did they have the best adaption of a science fiction novel for television (anybody remember the wretched Martian Chronciles?)but they also [took] the crow from Star Trek.
Ben Browder is terrific as sarcastic, energetic and confused (at least for the first season)John Crichton. When Scorpius is finally introduced the series really gained steam; he's the ultimate villian akin to Q from Trek but without any redeeming social value. Any television series is only as good as its villans and Farscape has terrific bad guys hidden up every sleeve.
The DVD collection basically collates the entire single disc two episode releases. There's no additional extras that I could see--but each disc already came with audio commentary on key episodes by creator Rockne O'Bannon and the cast, as well as, previous unseen footage. There's also deleted scenes on a number of the discs and production notes, etc. So while this doesn't have anything new to add to the mix, bit does bring together the entire set in an affordable package (you'd pay twice as much to buy individual disc). Since the discs are arranged chronologically, if you buy some there's a good chance you'll get both the duds and the classic episodes and miss out on some of the best episodes.
The packaging isn't anything to write home about (unlike, say The Next Generation) and the information enclosed isn't all that great (unlike, say, the Back to the Future set)but you get them all the good, the bad and the ugly. I wouldn't have it any other way.",1041897600,5,2304,4.8951406649616365

1719234,5,B000067IVT,"Definitely an auspicious beginning for what would be, for 3 seasons, one of the most intelligently-written, fabulously trippy, ""out there"" shows on TV.
You've heard it all by now, John Crichton is an astronaut who gets sucked through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy.  Yes, the BUCK ROGERS paralells are rather strong.  However, it's not a retelling of BUCK ROGERS by any means.  You've got the Peacekeepers, who look human but most assuredly aren't.  There's Dominar Rygel XVI, a deposed Hynerian ruler and one of the crew's resident con artists.  Zhaan, the spiritually enlightened priestess/healer.  Ka D'argo, a wrongly-imprisoned man in search of his son.  Chiana, rebellious youth and the other resident con artist.  Aeryn Sun, the irreversibly-contaminated reluctant heroine.  And then there's Crichton, the human simply in search of a way home.  All of these beings live on board Moya, a biological ship with the wonderful Pilot.
Don't let Henson's involvement with this make you believe that these are just Muppets in Space.  They're far beyond that.  The Creature Shop has achieved what the FX teams on more than a couple of current SF series can only dream of, truly believable aliens that actually come alive right before your eyes.  Let yourself be drawn in, and you won't believe what you see.

Note to the studio:  Bring the price down and I and many others would be only too happy to add this to our collections.

Real problems and unreal problems alike are confronted.  A living ship is devoured by another entity, and the only way out is to make the creature vomit.  On the other hand, relationships between the crewmembers are endangered when buried feelings reveal themselves in inconvienient situations.  A thrilling ride.

1719240,5,B000067IVT,"SAVE FARSCAPE!!  This show had the potential of an epic Star Wars like franchise with adults in mind.  ""Sex Drugs and rock and roll in space"" I've heard it described.  I prefer to to think of it as imagination unleashed, and the technical wizardry to back it up.  The sex part is subtle and the drugs part is even subtler, the cast of aliens had grown to Star Trek like proportions, and although typical humanoid aliens were present, they weren't the majority; some greatly superior to humans physicaly, such as the scarans or the Luxans; intelectually superior? That remains to be seen.  Our only earthling; John Chriton; on board an escaped prison ship, comes with a cocky attitute and a mix of scietific genius and fisticuffs to back it up, the ladies seem to rather enjoy him as well.  As for ""can kids watch it?""  Depends on the episode, some get fairly graphic, which general audiences eat right up.  I can't begin to understand SciFi's decision to cancel the 5th season, but let it be known ""Crackers DO Matter!""",1034121600,6,1019,4.653631284916201
1719241,5,B000067IVT,"Farscape is arguably the best SF ever produced for television. It takes a fairly common storyline of a group of travelers thrown together and being pursued by individual of near obsessive (and evil) qualities. This formula has gone bad before in several genres, western, SF, road movies etc. Here, an contemporary American astronaut is sucked through a wormhole into another side of the galaxy where he is immediately caught up in a ""prison break"" in space. What makes Farscape so successful is a mixture of qualities.

First the casting is excellent. Filmed in Australia, most of the characters (except the lead, John Crighton's) are from there giving it an ""off"" feel to American ears which contributes to it's alieness. Each of the character's is part colorful stereotype, has weaknesses and is extremely individual. The chemistry is fantastic, especially after the first two or three shows in the series. Especially notworthy is the chemistry between the love interests played by Claudia Black and Ben Browder (John Crighton).
Another plus is the writing. Non-stop action and story telling is the hallmark of this series. Little time is spent creating mood or atmosphere (that is done by the characters and background), everything advances the plot line. Additionally, most episodes are connected in that previous storylines are built upon and create a chronology of events for the later stories.
Farscape space is inhabited by aliens who pass gas, burp, have intimate relations, love, hate, get hungry and can be fairly dirty in their habits. Add to this the great cultural references made by Crighton, the viewer gets the feeling that this is a bit like what space would really be like. A far cry from the antiseptic cleanliness and ""wonder"" of the Star Trek franchise.
Lastly Farscape has a timeline in the sense that it's not an endless variety of adventures for no particular reason there is an actual endstate the writers and producers have in mind at the end of the series.

Let's hope that Sci Fi Channel has the good sense to let Farscape complete its last season and reverse its cancellation. Shows of this quality and with such a loyal fanbase are rare.",1033689600,132,2168,4.986187845303867
1719242,5,B000067IVT,"I've collected a lot of DVD's, some good, some bad, but there is no better set than Farscape. No matter what you crave, be it action, romance, drama, comedy, special FX, you will find it with FS. This is no ordinary series, the storylines, characters, acting & cinematagraphy rival that of movies like Star Wars, Star Trek & such. I don't think I've ever connected or gotten attached to characters as much as these. The acters are little known but they shouldn't be. Their skills rival the best that Hollywood has.
As you've probably read, Farscape is due to be cancelled which is to me just ridiculous being one of the most popular shows out there. However, it's rumored that if their ratings go up before the end of season 4 they may not cancel it.
Season one introduces you to the various characters, good and bad,and revolves alot around the main character, astronaut John Crichton. Most of the time you feel lost as he does trying to cope with new surroundings & a new way of life(which is very good acting by Ben Browder).
Season two evolves the other characters and their relationships towards each other.
Season three is loaded to the max with drama.
Season four is only halfway through but so far so good.
Each DVD is loaded with extras:Character back stories, acter biographies, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, interviews, artwork, specialFX, Photo galleries,& even alien language and meanings. You definitly get your money's worth.

1719244,5,B000067IVT,"I am writing this review with a heavy heart.  Shortly after I first started writing this review I learned that The Sci Fi channel/USA Network had decided to cancel Farscape at the conclusion of it's fourth season (which will probably happen around March of 2003).  Stupid, Stupid, Stupid.
Farscape is truly the best show on television - not just science fiction television.  What the ""science fiction"" aspect does, or did, was open it up and allow the writers and actors to push the envelope and keep the audience guessing and surprised while offering just plan good stories. The characters and stories are extremely well written, complex, multi-layered, dramatic, quick-whit funny, and often a little (or very) twisted with direction and visuals worthy of any big screen motion picture.  It's got everything you could possibly want.  There's sex, there's violence, there's partial nudity, and there's colorful language as well as, you're-the-love-of-my-life romance, personal sacrifices for greater goods, humility and elegant prose.  And on top of all of that, special effects, costuming and make-up that makes those folks over at Skywalker Ranch and Industrial Light & Magic go, ""Wow.""  (And believe me, Farscape is what the current Star Wars films * should * be.)
Listen, if you don't enjoy Farscape it's just something wrong with ya.  :)  If you don't believe me, access the reviews of any professional entertainment critic who's seen it and read what he or she has to say.  I'll bet you'll find the reviews to be at least 95% positive.  But here's the real kicker - they're actually correct!  How often does it happen that the audience and the critics are in agreement?  I guess in hindsight, this should have been the first red flag that the show was doomed for a premature demise.  [Sigh]  Farscape is truly the whole package.  Did I mention that the powers that be at The Sci Fi Channel/USA Network are stupid for canceling it?  Oh yeah, ... I did.  Anyway, run, do not walk, your mouse over to the shopping cart and drop this puppy in.  Pick up every Farscape item you can find for that matter.  I guarantee you will not regret it.  The only bad thing is the profits The Sci Fi/USA Network will get from your purchases.  [Sigh]  There's just no justice in the world - or at the other end of a wormhole.",1032393600,11,2312,4.7974683544303796
1719245,4,B000067IVT,"If you don't know what Farscape's about, Amazon's plot synopsis will give you an idea much better than I could. Here's what makes Farscape Season 1 special:
- Irreverent humor. Farscape's unique among sci-fi shows in that its hero is himself a sci-fi fan. Seeing Ben Browder's John Crichton toss off references to Star Wars, Star Trek and other classic sci-fi tales is funny. Seeing his alien crewmates' puzzled reactions is even funnier.
- Unpredictability. Like Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Farscape gleefully takes all the worn-out stereotypes of its genre and blows them to pieces. If you're used to sci-fi where the good guys never make mistakes, and you always know how the show will end well before the third act, get ready for something very different.
- An unconventional hero. In later seasons, tragic and fairly nasty experiences will lead John Crichton to adopt a draw-your-gun-first, ask-later viewpoint. In Season 1 he's still full of wonder and scientific curiosity, and he's prone to think his way out of a crisis rather than relying on firepower.
- An equally unusual crew dynamic. Later seasons see the crew getting along more or less harmoniously. Season 1 allows new viewers the genuine treat of watching a group of irritable and potentially dangerous protagonists forced to work together to save their own lives. Moya's crew members don't always like or trust one another, and it makes for satisfying and intriguing entertainment.
If you've ever wished that someone would apply Buffy's signature mix of humor, darkness and intelligence to space opera; if you've ever wondered what Star Trek would be like without that gigantic stick up its port nacelle; or if you're simply curious to see what the company that brought you The Muppet Show can do with science fiction... Farscape will thrill and entertain you tremendously.",1032393600,32,1840,5.075907590759076

Unfortunetly, the Sci-Fi channel is currently making a big mistake by cancelling the show due to buget problems with the series. I think that they are forgetting the simple fact that Farscape made the Sci-fi channel a viable station.  Well, they will learn their lesson soon enough if one of the big fish like HBO or showtime snatch up this tremendous show.
Come to think of it, I think I would like it better on HBO or showtime since there will then be no more bombardments of commercials ever five minutes. Hmmmmm. . . perhaps this is a good thing.
Either way, snatch up all of the episodes in the DVD Box sets as they are released.  They are soooooooo worth it.

Farscape is the best show on television!  It is the best thing that the Sci-Fi Channel has, has ever had, and probably ever will have!  Farscape is better then the new Star Trek, ""Enterprise,"" and the last two Star Wars films, combined.  For some reason though, (they claim ratings and cost, but it's been the #1 show for them for four years, and advertisers love it), Sci-Fi Channel has just cancelled this wondrous program.

You can go to savefarscape.com to find out what you can do, and make sure to support the show by buying these DVD's, the video game, t-shirts, posters, etc., to show your appreciation for the series, and to show Sci-Fi that Farscape is their greatest asset, and that it should remain on their programming schedule for years to come!",1031961600,72,1185,4.751219512195122

This seems to be all 11 discs originally released one at a time packed into 6 page filled keep cases. The box itself seems to be very decorative to the Farscape scenes, covering one side with one of the most memorable scnene, the pod trwirling into the wormhole. Many believe they may a have put some new effort into the box set by releasing an 12th disc to fit the last case, but all is just speculation.
The discs will have the same stuff, down the the very menus, but the cases that they are stored in are being re-designed to fit the first season better. Hopefully the open side will be very presentable like the StarGate SG-1 box sets with un-cluttered spines like many ADV cases never seem to do. But as long as all the episodes are present and they are presented in all their glory, nobody should reject this set.

It's like Rocky Jones TNG. It's boring and silly. The screechy theme song is ear-splitting. The Muppets characters are childish, the Ben Browder character is Frat Boy In Space, and much as I like to watch Claudia Black, she was given much less to do here than in Stargate SG-1, another lousy sci-fi show but brightened by her work in the last two seasons.
