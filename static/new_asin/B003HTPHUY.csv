4125945,5,B003HTPHUY,"After viewing the trailer of this movie I had low expectations of the movie, because the trailer looked kind of cheesy. But, because I love sci-fi movies and the plot looked interesting I bought the movie anyways.  After watching the movie I was really impressed with the effects, the acting and the story line. Adrian Paul and Danny Trejo were good as always and Julie Horner was AMAZINGLY good looking!",1279670400,3,404,4.771428571428571
4125946,5,B003HTPHUY,"I rented this movie with no expectations. It was in the new release section with only 3 copies available. I was impressed with this film, because the acting was good, special effects were good, and it had a nice story-line. During most movies you can pause it at any point, and pretty much guess what is going to happen next. Hollywood seems to use the same formula to write most movies. This one was different, and it was a very nice change. This story-line surprised me more than once. I think it makes a great rental, but I don't think it has much replay value, which is pretty much my point of view on most movies with a lot of suspense.",1278892800,8,641,4.305785123966942
4125947,5,B003HTPHUY,"I too saw this movie at a premier. I also got a chance to talk with the director and his wife who wrote the screenplay.  I'm not a really big fan of action movies, and this definately had a lot of action, but it was really the dialog that I felt sold the movie. It's witty, fast-paced and more importantly contained a pertinent message. The cast for the most part were great, especially Adrian Paul. He really made the movie. The special effects were good, the robots were believable. The only thing I didn't care for was the jumpy filming at the very beginning of the movie. It was intentional but I didn't think it was necessary. Either way, it didn't last long and so didn't distract from what was a very good movie. Well worth purchasing, especially if you are a fan of Adrian Paul.",1277942400,23,786,4.383561643835616
4125948,4,B003HTPHUY,"I saw Eyeborgs at its premier screening in St. Pete Beach, and it is a fun ""killer robot"" movie wrapped around a moral/political message. If you want to pay attention, you can catch the allegories to real-life situations equally involving privacy of citizens, and trusting the media and government. However, in essence it is a fun movie about robots being used to take over society. An independent film with a very high production value and excellent special effects. The robots, especially the ""Reapers"" are extremely well done. Very good performance by Adrian Paul as the Department of Homeland Defense Agent. I definitely recommend this movie for sci-fi fans.",1276992000,38,662,5.138888888888889
4125949,3,B003HTPHUY,"Again, no new ground, no stand out acting nor special effects nor plot line. Worth a free or cheap rental.

Oh, heck yes check!  ...and then we watched the movie, and got to the end saying, wow, this movie had no right to be this good.  multiple viewings have just made me appreciate it more, as I see how things tie into the plot.  This movie should not have been good.  But it is.  If you like killer robot movies or are an Adrian Paul fan, it's worth checking out.  (also, this movie has some of the cutest killer robots EVER.)",1377216000,2,561,4.266666666666667
4125954,1,B003HTPHUY,I like B grade SF.  Ever since I was a kid watching TV on rainy Saturday afternoons. This one has few redeeming qualities. Acting not bad enough to be unique. Story line based on the concept is watching you and that's it.  Watching you with big and small Eyeborg robots.  Oh and they can also Zap you with built in stun guns.  Maybe other capabilities but I didn't get past the interrogation scene.  One star be size it is Science Fiction,1376956800,,438,4.3580246913580245

4125956,3,B003HTPHUY,"This was not the sleekest execution of a cautionary tale in the vein of ""1984"" where Big Brother is Watching or ""Minority Report"" where a collaborative of Psychics by virtue of their consensus decree a pre crime has been committed. What makes this one particularly unnerving is that it is depicted in post 911 America where in the face of terror we are willingly giving up our freedoms and subjecting ourselves to an increasing police state under ""Homeland Security"". The movie addresses the prevalence of cameras and projects a bit further and almost laughably where robot cameras equipped with weapons not too dissimilar to the present day drone strikes now that I think about it(Hmmm, maybe not so laughable in theory but at least in cheesy execution).It really addresses such issue as the relinquishment of arms to a government bent on protecting you from the terror that is outside your door. This film has extreme and sadly increasing relevance with Wiki leaks and Edward Snowden being depicted in the Media as enemies of the State vs Heroic Champions of the people's rights. While it is somewhat cheesy in it's execution this movie addresses post 911 paranoia and life under scrutiny by Big Brother. i agree with those that categorize this as apolitical statement with a ""B"" movie feel about it. If you want a more buttoned down movie with similar content and better execution, see Equilibrium starring Taye Diggs and Christian Bale and the Bradbury Masterptece, Farenheit 451.",1372204800,,1484,4.987903225806452

4125958,3,B003HTPHUY,"The story was pretty good for a tired idea.  Machines taking over the world has been done many times before, but this story reflects our times which made it easy to relate too.  The acting is weak at times as is the CGI, but there are also some really great moments in both of these areas and the screenplay and directing is good enough to keep you interested.",1370390400,,360,4.279411764705882
4125959,1,B003HTPHUY,"I don't know where to begin with this..... This was probably one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. I feel noticeably stupider from watching this,  The only movie I think is worse than this is Eden Log. I would give it no stars but I cant do that if I want to leave a review",1368921600,,281,3.9298245614035086
4125960,4,B003HTPHUY,"Fantastic look at how things could be if we continue down the current path we're on.  Similar stories have been done time and time again, but this throws a unique look at it ala Starship Troopers style.  There were plenty of great camera angles, good ambient lighting, and thoughtful direction indicating a bunch of people really cared about making this movie.  The acting was above average for a B movie, and the actors sold the majority of the scenes well.  The special effects were believable, and the CG artists produced some great meshes and renders that blended with the environment and live actors 95% of the time.

I really only had 1 small complaint, and that is with some of the camera work in the outdoor dialogues, the cameraman seemed to be a little low on blood sugar, or in the early stages of Parkinsons because the camera work was a little too shaky for my tastes.

Overall, if you're a fan of a Starship Troopers style story highlighting what happens when we trade liberty for security via spybots and you don't require a bunch of overdone special FX to sell it, this is most definitely worth a watch.",1368748800,,1119,4.597989949748744

4125963,1,B003HTPHUY,"This movie leaves a bad residue on my palate. Bad acting, bad screenplay. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 star was due to the ""Eyeborg"" special effects; besides that one reason I would have given it a 0(Zero). I love Sci/Fi Action movies and this one just doesnt cut the mustard.",1364515200,,285,4.296296296296297
4125964,2,B003HTPHUY,"Moderately entertaining dystopian sci-fi flick with a decent b-list cast, but seriously, it's just libertarian propaganda.

4125965,3,B003HTPHUY,It reminded me of 1984. The action wasn't great and neither was the dialogue but I had fun watching it.,1361145600,,103,4.2
4125966,5,B003HTPHUY,Adrian Paul was superb in this movie and I HAD to get it when i saw it a year or so ago. Shows how multi-talented he is as a Director and an actor. Very futuristic with surveillance theme. Get it !!,1360108800,,198,3.8536585365853657
4125967,3,B003HTPHUY,"""Eyeborgs"" is a post-modern sci-fi film that asks: ""Who watches the watchers?""

Instead of a motley collection of costumed superheroes, the watchers in question are the titular ""eyeborgs,"" robots used by the government to spy on everyone.  These eyeborgs range from the Q-bert-esque two-legged walking cameras to human-sized crab walkers with multiple legs and a single eye.  There are other robots too, ranging from medical assistants to roving tank-like assault mechs.

Our hero, Agent Gunner (Adrian Paul), was at least partially responsible for the proliferation of these eyeborgs after a lone gunman murdered his wife and child at a playground in open daylight.  If the authorities had been paying attention, he could have been stopped, and popular outrage led to a law passing eyebots in every day society.  Eyeborgs are capable of assisting in arrests, which makes their authority all the more frightening.

When lone gunman Sankur (Dale Girard) attempts to assassinate punk band singer Brandon (Devin McGee), muttering about the robot conspiracy, Gunner's curiosity is piqued.  He's one of the few people uncomfortable with the idea of eyeborgs roaming the streets.  When Sankur is murdered in custody and the blame is pinned on him, Gunner realizes something is very, very wrong.

""Eyeborgs"" is as much about perception as it is about privacy and civil liberties, heady stuff for a small independent film.  When your primary interaction with the world is through a digital lens, whoever controls the lens controls reality.

Unfortunately, the cast isn't quite up to snuff.  Paul is passable as the ambivalent lead, but Julie Horner is pretty terrible as newscaster Ronni, spouting her words like the lead of a high school play.  The special effects easily upstage them both, a credit to the film's wise use of budget and lighting.

Given the nature of the society it chronicles, ""Eyeborgs"" can't end well for its heroes. Instead it opts for an open-ended conclusion that could easily be the pilot for a series.  The credits go a long way to help repair the ending, but sci-fi fans may walk away feeling unsatisfied.  Your enjoyment of the film is likely a matter of perception.",1349827200,,2186,5.112676056338028
4125968,4,B003HTPHUY,"I liked it a lot! Sometimes it seemed slow & awkward, but overall it was a very good movie. Don't let the naysayers of this movie deter you. It is worth the watching. It could have been the precursor of Terminator, but it stands alone still. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because Amazon refuses to implement CC. Which I need when they are whispering and during loud action scenes. Boo-hiss-hiss Amazon!",1343347200,,410,4.554054054054054
4125969,4,B003HTPHUY,"I just finished this one, I was more than pleased with it.

On a scale of 1 to 10:
1 (total crap) and 10 (all kinds of awesome)
I'm giving this one an 8, because the conspiracy plot of this film really had me.",1338422400,,209,3.75
4125970,5,B003HTPHUY,"This is one of the most thought provoking movies I have seen in the last decade.  Every American should watch this film at least once.  I enjoyed this film so much that I immediately ordered it on DVD and Blu-ray immediately after watching it as a rental.

It takes place in the not too distant future.  It is about VERY mobile security cameras that are only supposed to observe.  Nothing else.  What the public does not know, is that each eyeborg is fitted with at least one weapon.  Even the tiny eyeborgs.  The movie provides a very realistic example of how technology can be exploited and abused by government.  It even quotes Benjamin Franklin: ""Those who would sacrifice freedom for safety, deserve neither.""

Do yourself a favor, watch this and think about it.  Tell everyone you know about this movie.  The more people that see it, the better.",1337212800,3,851,4.675675675675675
4125971,3,B003HTPHUY,"The storyline is pretty good but the script needed a bit more work. The cgi had a few flaws (i.e. when the killer robots entered the secret passage)and could learn a few things from SyFy's ""Sanctuary"" computer modellers. The background masking left much to be desired. But after all is said and done, I'd give it a ""B"" Movie ""B minus"". Mainly because I found myself wondering if it could be a series or have a sequel.",1332806400,,417,4.428571428571429
4125972,2,B003HTPHUY,Poor production quality and directing. Not much to the storey either. Toward the end of the movie a woman cop gets killed during a shootout with the robots and a few scenes later the same scene is used again. If you like the movies that the SiFi channel makes you will probably like this one. I had to fast forward through all the time wasting arguing scenes (a favorite way to fill time when there's an idea for a movie but no storey). I would say it could have been cut down to 30 minutes with the material they had to work with.,1331769600,,531,4.165048543689321
4125973,5,B003HTPHUY,"Creators went totally overboard conjuring this unbelievable world, where under the disguise of protecting its citizens the government takes shortcuts trampling on basic rights and civil liberties, ending up as a dictatorship disguised as a democracy.  To boot all of this is done through the use of media and autonomous drones.

The storyline focuses on number of characters who slowly, and mostly by chance, learn the truth behind secretive, high tech security program - ODIN - that was supposed to protect the children and guard from terrorism...

4125974,3,B003HTPHUY,"Eyeborgs was about a 7 on a scale of 1-10, in my opinion.

Please check out my all time favorite TV series ""Misfits"" online at hulu.",1324512000,,269,4.74468085106383
4125975,4,B003HTPHUY,"A good sci-fi movie to watch on a rainy afternoon. The story is a modern day version of Big Brother, where the government is always watching. It leaves some things unanswered which is better than the usual ""tie everything up in a pretty bow"" type movies. Lots of political commentary on where our freedoms in the US might be headed without being preachy, which is what a good sci-fi movie should do.

As always, Adrian Paul is hunky man candy to watch. Very good and worth watching compared to so many b-type sci-fi movies out there. The ending left me wishing they would have turned it into a tv series.",1321660800,,604,4.490909090909091
4125976,4,B003HTPHUY,"i give this video 4 out of 5. its not the greatest but id put it right up there with speed and war of the worlds. the only recognizable charachter is Adrian Paul (Highlander TV series) and i've always liked him so he kinda made the flick for me. but all in all, its a good SkyNet style story line and full of action. thanks amazon for making this free with my prime.

4125977,4,B003HTPHUY,"Adrian Paul definitely makes this movie.  He doesn't have much of a supporting cast, but the writing makes this movie watchable.

All you really need to do is at the end have the President's nephew say he is John Connor.  (Spoiler)  In this movie people make machines to watch out for crimes.  So everyone in monitored and it is really really hard to do any terrorist stuff.  The robots get upgraded and eventually kill off the president, fix votes and slowly take over the earth.

4125983,3,B003HTPHUY,"This movie has some good points. Great acting, great special effects and technical artistry and it really does have a good story. But it is very radically political and since this came out of Hollywood you can guess what side it will take. If you are even just a little conservative you will find yourself a target of this film and called an A$$Hole every few minutes. This movie even goes so far as to imply that fear of terrorism is simply paranoia and that terrorists are an invention of Right Wing conspirators. Since I know people who have lost family members in the 911 attacks I can assure you that they are not a computer generated illusion and I find this insinuation profoundly insulting. Sick. It is also deadly serious and has no sense of humor at all. Its Metropolis again. But this time, instead of Maria we have mobile cameras that follow you around in public and are now sneaking into peoples houses. The fact that these things are roughly the size of a softball and have legs makes it seem pretty silly that no one ever notices them hiding behind their sofas. Why is hiding so much easier in movies than in real life? Does everyone have glaucoma? We also have cops using contemporary forensics to find digital clues, when it is obviously far into the future. It is as if robotics leaped 200 years into the future and everything else just froze in time. I would say its a sort of would be Robocop, but that film knew its limitations. It had a simple message of good against evil. Eyeborgs (I can't help but think that this movie might have gone farther if it had a less silly title) Reaches to every extreme. White men aren't to be trusted. Anyone over 25 cant be trusted either. A black woman is inherently good a white man is inherently evil. (Bigotry and racism is okay if it is directed at white men.) You get the picture. There is also the issue of impracticality. How many of these things are there and how many of them are wasting their time following around someone who comes home from work at McDonalds and isn't doing anything but lying around playing X Box with a bag of Cheetos on his gut. Incidentally, you cannot invade someones privacy when they are in public. Public is the opposite of private. To be a little optimistic, the twist ending is quite brilliant, if derivative of another series of cyborg movies, and mitigates many of my complaints and I can say that ultimately I think its a good film. But its radicalism left a bad taste in my mouth and I can't say I walked away with clear conscience. The same sort of uneasy feeling I have when I see a Roman Polansky, Woody Allen or Victor Salva movie being shown on TV.",1303516800,,2653,4.449691991786447

4125988,4,B003HTPHUY,"Despite having a raging headache, I enjoyed this movie on a Saturday afternoon. The plot centers around a cop, Adrian Paul who's big idea of robot eyes used to catch criminals gets out of hand. His wife is killed by a criminal that is never caught and these eyes are his idea to prevent it from happening again. However, a Dick Cheney type character gets his hands on them and turns them into a 1984 type monster political machine and well, you see where things go from there. Soon the eyeborgs take on a mind of their own and soon mayhem ensues.

For a movie done on the cheap, it was pretty well made. The special effects are not that bad and it is fairly believable. Mr. Paul is still a bit hard to picture without the ponytail and the sword but I got used to it. I got a real kick out of Danny Trejo as G-Man. He is one of those guys that makes a movie as a ""character.""

4125991,4,B003HTPHUY,"This film is an enjoyable sci-fi thriller/action movie. On the surface it may appear just to be another technology gone wrong movie, but it may be a preview of sorts as to where the society may be heading.

The movie starts out where the ""The Freedom of Observation Act"" has become law in the United States. This law allows the use of ""Eyeborgs"" and other technology to keep tabs on anyone that the government may be of the opinion is a risk to the national security of the country.

ODIN (The Optical Defence Intelligence Network) is the agency manages the Eyeborgs that have the capability to intervene at a crime scene. However, their full range of capabilites, seem to have been kept from the public.

Agent Reynolds (Adrian Paul) and his partner visit a potential crime scene with intel from the eyeborgs. It turns out that the target to be executed is the nephew of the president of the United States. From then on the plot thickens to the point where recorded reality starts to change as the Eyeborgs cleverly start to edit and adjust the videos produced.

However, a nosey reporter, gets her suspicions up and the eyeborgs go on a campaign to cover their tracks. The action continues as different persons are targeted.

There is a lot of tight action sequences and a lot of all out gun battles. The CG work on the eyeborgs is flawless and the acting is quite acceptable.

In the end it may leave you thinking, as technology develops, how will it really affect our privacy as well as the freedoms that we now enjoy?",1290988800,,1522,4.577205882352941
4125992,5,B003HTPHUY,"Here is a movie that I didn't go into with much as far as expectations go. But, boy, was I surprised. It started off a little slow with, other than Adrian Paul and Barbara Hawkins, who both gave excellent performances, quite a bit of cardboard-like acting...and, of course, this sort of thing can be expected from an obvious 'B' movie with 'B' actors. But by mid-way into ""Eyeborgs"" I was totally sucked in. The robots were creepy as they began to display behaviors involving independent thinking and murderous intent. When characters that mattered started dropping like flies, I realized then that the movie-makers, Fran and Richard Clabaugh, had every intention of creating a creepy and suspenseful flick for all to enjoy. Even with the limited budget, they managed to pull it off too. The CGI effects were obvious in some parts, in particular, where they forgot to add shadows, but overall, they were quite convincing, and after being immersed in the better-than-average, engrossing, political story and plot, the small distractions were unnoticeable altogether. There was a nice twist at the end as well that tied it all up into a nice Sci-Fi movie that should not be missed!

If you like Sci-Fi and/or action flicks, this one's for you!

It's not Terminator 2, but given it's limited budget, it still pulled off five stars for me. Bravo to all involved! *****",1290729600,,1364,4.9004329004329
4125993,3,B003HTPHUY,"OK, I'll admit it: I bought this primarily because much or most of the action was filmed in my home town and inside my office building. But it's actually not a bad storyline and the acting ranges from OK to good. Trust me when I say it's MUCH better than the fahrbot dren movies SyFy throws together for Saturday retch-fests.",1286668800,4,325,4.433333333333334
4125994,4,B003HTPHUY,"IM A BIG ADRIAN PAUL FAN. I THINK HE WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT JAMES BOND. HE HAS HAD SOME ODD CHOICES FOR STARRING ROLES SINCE THE HIGHLANDER. THIS ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT WASNT A POOR CHOICE, NOR A GREAT ONE. THE EFFECTS WERE PRETTY GOOD FOR A MOVIE OF ITS BUDGET, BUT THE STORY COULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMPELLING. IN THE END, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WOW EFFECTS AND TOP SHELF SCI-FI... THIS AINT IT. IF YOU WANNA SEE ADRIAN PAUL IN A MOVIE OF C+ TO B QUALITY BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAN OF HIS... THEN THIS IS FOR YOU.

4125995,4,B003HTPHUY,"Sci-fi ""B"" movie fans are used to taking their passion with a grain of salt-- bad dialogue, cheesy effects and low budgets are all par for the course.  ""Eyeborgs"" is occasionally guilty of all these things, but more often than not it is tense, believable, and clever.  Very clever.  If you were willing to even glance at this review, you should be buying or renting ""Eyeborgs"" right now.",1285200000,3,387,4.661764705882353
4125996,4,B003HTPHUY,"I bought the Blu-Ray, thinking I was getting a sci-fi film that I hadn't heard any buzz about.  It IS a sci-fi movie, but what you need to know, in order to know if you would like it is that it's really a political commentary.  If you took Oliver Stone, Roger Moore, the movie Hardware and Terminator: Rise of the Machines, and mixed them all together, you might get this film.

It's sometime in the unspecified future and Homeland Security has expanded.  Dramatically.  All surveillance cameras (public and private) have been linked together into a single ""anti-terrorist"" surveillance system under the ""Freedom of Observation"" Act, a follow-up to the Patriot Act.  This surveillance has been greatly enhanced by the creation of mobile observation bots (the eyeborgs), which are ubiquitous.  They aren't SUPPOSED to enter private property without a search warrant--but for law enforcement and Homeland Security officials, getting a search warrant is as automated, and takes about as long, as it takes you to make a small-item purchase by swiping your credit card.  These eyeborg surveillance bots come in a variety of sizes, shapes (and functionalities).  In this environment the story line is told via a purple-haired heavy-metal rocker who happens to be the nephew of the President, some DHS agents, a female newscaster for the major TV network, and some lesser characters.  The eyeborgs are out of control.  They don't just survey, they have weapons, too.  (Why haven't people noticed this yet?)  There seems to be some kind of plot-to blow up the President?  And who is controlling these out of control eyeborgs?  Is it the President?  The Vice-President?  Someone unidentified in the vast security network that's been created?  Some anti-technology, anti-surveillance underground movement?  Foreign terrorists?  The machines themselves? (like Skynet?)

The movie starts out kinda funny, and then it gradually gets scarier (more reminiscent of the Terminator films) as we follow this cast of characters trying to figure out what is going on and who'se behind it.  This movie takes all kinds of modern-day trends and just extrapolates them: CNN (I swear one newscaster sounds somewhat like Rick Sanchez).  Homeland Security.  Patriot Act.  Gulf Wars.  War against terrorism.  Total Information Awareness.  9/11.  Loss of constitutional freedoms.  Distrust of big government.  Stolen elections.  And whether technology is a tool, or whether it is controlling our lives as much as we are controlling it.  Who will guard the guardians? And more.  The movie's central (political) thesis might best be summed up by a quote from Ben Franklin, delivered partway through, something like, ""Those who value security more than freedom are deserving of neither one.""  By the way ""eyeborg"" being the play on the word ""cyborg"" that it is, I thought the whole title was a misnomer since these are purely machines with no biological components--until I thought about this concept that technology is developing us (as a society) just as much as we are developing it--perhaps this is a notion the scriptwriter had in mind with the title-that our whole society is coming to resemble something like a cybernetic organism.

The acting is not great but it's OK.  The CG machines are decent enough.  The action is OK, but nothing compelling.  The music is not my kind of taste: too much on the heavy-metal side for me.  All-in-all, this is like the 2010 film update to the old classic ""1984""--asking us just where we are headed as a civilization--off the cliff?  Can we stop?  The only thing that kept me interested all the way through was this underlying social commentary.  I personally wouldn't find it all that interesting as a plain sci-fi or action film.  I hope this allows you to decide if you want to see it or not, without giving away too many plot spoilers.",1283126400,23,3849,5.0701754385964914
4125997,3,B003HTPHUY,The makers of EYEBORGS have to be congratulated that they make no attempts to hide that they are presenting a B-Movie. It's a very typical killer robots story. Adrian Paul turns in the best performance possible under B-Movie restrictions of a less than edge-of-your-seat script. The cheese factor is pretty high.,1282867200,4,312,5.137254901960785

8397200,4,B003HTPHUY,"Went into this one expecting little else than a ""watch once"" extra-time burner, and from the opening moments it seemed to be fulfilling that expectation. But remarkably, even though it's still not the most ""polished"" piece of audio-visual entertainment out there, I nonetheless found myself being drawn in ever so gradually and consistently until I found myself constantly guessing at which of unusually numerous potential outcomes would come to fruition, even right up to the very end when I'd pretty much anticipated the big surprise reveal but still got thown a curve ball as to the whole reason why such a scenario came into existence in the first place.

And here is yet another example of what ""Hollywood"" needs to get a clue about regarding why so much trash talk surrounds many (if not most) of the movies its been in the habit plopping onto our plates like yesterday's stale hash for about the past decade and a half -- that loud booms, hyperactive editing, and flashy eye-candy F/X are not in and of themselves what equate into good moviemaking, but that it's all wasted effort & expense if you don't have a good and well-executed ""STORY"" to back it all up! This movie struggles with its ""unrefined"" look & feel in the visual glitz & acting departments, but its intriguing and nicely paced story was enough to keep the mind from focusing too heavily on those minor flaws, and made not only for some decent ""popcorn"" entertainment but also, in the end, some very ""thought-provoking"" entertainment as well.

This movie went directly to home media... but it should've been given it's own time in the sun on the Big Screen beforehand, and in exchange for this about half of all the other crapola that saw theatrical releases around the same time should've been the ones to get the DHM treatment.",1458518400,,1801,4.787781350482315
