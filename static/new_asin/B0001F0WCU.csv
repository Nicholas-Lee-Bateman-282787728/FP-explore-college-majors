8011553,3,B0001F0WCU,It was an O.K. movie. It got a little silly.,1445904000,,44,3.5
8011554,1,B0001F0WCU,"One of the worst movie ever made. A total waste of great acting talents,  including the Producer and Director, the very talented : Stanley Donen",1443830400,,144,4.76
8011555,5,B0001F0WCU,Thanks...it arrived to me may the 27th....thanks,1434240000,,48,6.0
8011556,3,B0001F0WCU,"This movie was ""okay"" but was not anything special.
It had its light and humorous parts but nothing that got a big laugh out of me, (and I'm a pretty easy touch as far making me laugh).
Yeah, it was ""okay"" but that's about all I can say about it.",1431043200,,246,3.94
8011557,3,B0001F0WCU,"When a friend of Noel Coward complimented him on his performance and 'stealing the picture' he replied: 'My dear, it was petty larceny.' And so it proves.

As much as I admire the Master and I bought this film to see him in particular, I find the best and most appropriate performance comes from Mitzi Gaynor as the showgirl friend of exiled gangster Yul Brynner. Poor Yul, overacting to the max to inject some humour into his cartoonish character. Even the Master has to to use all his professional experience to inject life, variety  and even  sense into some of the most lugubrious and long-winded dialog ever to be foisted on professional actors. Which he does. Screenplay author Harry Kurnitz was a noted Hollywood wit, but he apparently left his wit at a Hollywood cocktail party as there is virtually none of it here.  And.. this was filmed partially on the island of Rhodes and it's in B & W.  And to top that, the director was Stanley Donen of ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers""  and ""Charade"".
Oh dear.

So what are the good things,
Christopher Challis did the cinematography.
Coward performs his only recorded  Sammy Cahn, James van Heusen work in a jazz combo setting of the title song, that features Mitzi dancing.
The supporting character actors.
Seeing two diverse acting personalities such as Yul Brynner and Noel Coward (in an extended role) together in a movie.
And last but certainly not least, Mitzi Gaynor injecting some 'reality' into the goings-on.

The word Misfire comes to mind, but if you are a fan of the people involved, it's watchable.",1407024000,,1587,4.762773722627737
8011558,4,B0001F0WCU,"It's cute watching Yul Brynner in this movie, he is usually stereotyped as a macho guy, but in this one he is always down on his luck, stuck with a silly girlfriend and not to mention penniless. It's one of those feel good movies.",1376092800,2,230,4.25
8011559,5,B0001F0WCU,"This one is in black and white, which somehow was a surprise - but it gave it a certain charm. Yul Brynner was fun as a fast-talking crook who has been deported to a small Greek island but still dreams of bigger things. He even stayed in character when required to act as though he had no idea what he was hearing when Noel Coward said ""good-by"" in a couple of different languages! Mitzi Gaynor was delightful as the not-so-dumb blonde. Noel Coward is the sophisticate in this one, and does it ever so well. I'll watch it again, it's just plain fun!",1362614400,3,549,4.339805825242719
8011560,5,B0001F0WCU,This was purchased as a gift for friend of mine who is Mitzi Gaynor fan. He loves it and was appreciative.,1358726400,,106,4.095238095238095
8011561,4,B0001F0WCU,"Fun to see Yul rynner in comedy movie .  It's a complete change and shows how versatile Yul was.  Mitzi is another Marilyn and Noel Coward, in a rare appearance is very sophisticated similar to his own plays.  Its a very very Surprise Package.",1318032000,5,243,4.4772727272727275
