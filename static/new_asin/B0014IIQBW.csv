3133479,4,B0014IIQBW,"I'd been considering purchasing the entire Marvel collection separately for awhile.  When I saw this box set was being released, I rushed online to find the best price.  I will agree with the poster above me...it's not worth the Amazon price (sorry guys...);  BUT...after clicking the ""New and Used"" link, I ended up buying the box set for about $38 TOTAL (tax, s/h).  It arrived in 4-5 days, even with standard shipping!

I'm not a big fan of DVD extras, really...just give me the movies themselves, and I'm happy.  I have to be honest...I actually really liked the DD Director's Cut.  It gave DD more of an actual story feel to it.  Elektra was, well, Elektra.  Getting the X-Men Trilogy was worth the price, and throwing in the 2 FF movies makes this box set a convenient way to complete your Marvel collection (already had Spider Man trilogy, Ghost Rider/Punisher/Blade on the way).",1213142400,15,886,4.738562091503268
3133480,5,B0014IIQBW,Bought it for my 5 year old nephew. He just loves it. Can't get enough of superhero movies. His brother and sister love them as well.,1387324800,,133,4.153846153846154
3133481,4,B0014IIQBW,"I know what you're thinking. Daredevil? Elektra? Fantastic Four 1 and 2? X-men 3? There's only two good films in this set.

I'd argue there's only two bad films in the set. Although they have charismatic leads, Daredevil and Elektra just don't work. X-men 3: The Last Stand is certainly the weakest of the 3, but it has some great action set pieces and some pretty shocking twists. Finally, the Fantastic Four films. Everyone seems to hate them, but if you approach them as geared towards a younger audience, I think you might see they're pretty harmless fun. Yes, Galactus is a big space cloud rather than a purple-skirted giant planet eater, but would the latter have worked either?

Great price if you don't have these films.",1384387200,2,728,4.724409448818897
3133482,5,B0014IIQBW,"Yes, I'm an old guy. I've loved the Marvel Superheroes since they began in the 1960s. This is an excellent package. It's a great way to get so many superheroes all together.

3133483,5,B0014IIQBW,Such a great price for all these movies! I could not believe that I found 7 movies form my list all in one box set and for only $12!!!,1383868800,,134,3.6551724137931036
3133484,1,B0014IIQBW,"I asked Amazon if they would cut open the box and remove Daredevil, Elektra, and Silver Surfer. They said that they were unable to do so... so instead I purchased all the other movies separately which cost more, but it was worth it. I did not want anymore of my money going to Daredevil and Electric Nachos. The last time I watched these movies, I had 2 of my teeth turn brown, only to find out that they were dead on the inside. I googled it and found out that other people are experiencing a foul toxic smelling being emitted from the television while these two movies are being played. Then it clicked, I totally smelled it the same day my teeth turned brown, within 15 minutes after watching the movies. The smell is similar to a hot car engine after the oil has been changed, and the smell of a freshly exposed polaroid picture. I just didn't know it was possible for a movie to do that. Anyways... other people are experiencing same symptoms: dead teeth, excessive ringing in ears, etc. As for Silver Surfer, I just didn't like it. That was not a good movie.",1374969600,2,1064,4.406091370558376

3133486,4,B0014IIQBW,"I got this for my son for Christmas. He loved opening this up and seeing all the super hero movies, the only thing that we did not like is that there was a dvd in there with just comics on it that you couldn't even read. We thought it was a dvd of another cartoon, so it was kind of dissapointing. Other than that!

3133506,4,B0014IIQBW,"It was delightful to have all of these movies in one place, especially the sequels. I think we've all seen them, but if not, I'd say that you must see the X-Men movies, that I really liked the Fantastic Four movies, but not all of my friends did, and that Daredevil and Elektra were ok, but why did Elektra get brought back to life just so that she could never see Daredevil again? I guess I should have read the comic books.

I had a ball with the language options and special features. If I were a collector, I would have been transported by all of the goodies that came with it, but then, if I were a collector, I would have bought an extra set to leave in the wrapping and never to touch.

I'm not much for the goodies, though, and I would have traded a smaller bookshelf footprint for the little comic books. That's definitely up to the individual, and if you do like them, these were cute and attractively (and intelligently packaged).",1225411200,,941,4.340909090909091
3133507,5,B0014IIQBW,"I bought this as a deal for somewhere around $27, and it was well worth it.  It has all the orginal movies and all the extras, plus the Fantastic 4 cartoon shows (I believe 4 episodes) and 2 reprints of old X-men comic books in it.  Great for doing a marathon event.  Considering you can't even get the X-Men trilogy for that price, it was a smoking deal.",1225324800,,355,4.1911764705882355
3133508,4,B0014IIQBW,"I got this Marvel Collection on a Gold Box buy one day and it ended up being less than $30 for the whole set.  I personally think the X-Men movies are really good and worth the price of this set alone.

Daredevil and Elektra are some of the weaker movies but Fantastic Four and Rise of the Silver Surfer were good.  There are also extras like the Fantastic Four cartoon DVD and Marvel collectibles with comics and downloadable content for your PC/Mac.

All in all, this feels like a set that someone who is a fan of Marvel would love but also for the casual comic fan provides interesting looks into the world of Marvel.",1225238400,,620,4.3652173913043475

I think we've all seen them, but if not, I'd say that you must see the X-Men movies, that I really liked the Fantastic Four movies, but not all of my friends did, and that Daredevil and Elektra were ok, but why did Elektra get brought back to life just so that she could never see Daredevil again? I guess I should have read the comic books.

I had a ball with the language options and special features. If I were a collector, I would have been transported by all of the goodies that came with it, but then, if I were a collector, I would have bought an extra set to leave in the wrapping and never to touch.

I'm not much for the goodies, though, and I would have traded a smaller bookshelf footprint for the little comic books. That's definitely up to the individual, and if you do like them, these were cute and attractively (and intelligently packaged).",1225411200,,941,4.340909090909091
3368004,5,B0014IIQBW,"I bought this as a deal for somewhere around $27, and it was well worth it.  It has all the orginal movies and all the extras, plus the Fantastic 4 cartoon shows (I believe 4 episodes) and 2 reprints of old X-men comic books in it.  Great for doing a marathon event.  Considering you can't even get the X-Men trilogy for that price, it was a smoking deal.",1225324800,,355,4.1911764705882355
3368005,4,B0014IIQBW,"I got this Marvel Collection on a Gold Box buy one day and it ended up being less than $30 for the whole set.  I personally think the X-Men movies are really good and worth the price of this set alone.

Daredevil and Elektra are some of the weaker movies but Fantastic Four and Rise of the Silver Surfer were good.  There are also extras like the Fantastic Four cartoon DVD and Marvel collectibles with comics and downloadable content for your PC/Mac.

All in all, this feels like a set that someone who is a fan of Marvel would love but also for the casual comic fan provides interesting looks into the world of Marvel.",1225238400,,620,4.3652173913043475
