8549843,3,B00ABMAENK,"Narrated by Australian actor Tom Burlinson this product does what it says on the tin, discusses a range of lighthouses in Australia. The one hour, 43 minute DVD takes the viewer on a journey that criss-crosses the nation in no particular order and all up 19 lighthouses are featured. As you can imagine, with 19 lighthouses covered and around 100 minutes programme time... well you can do the maths regarding the sort of times devoted to each point of interest. Not massive but probably adequate.

Effectively each lighthouse is introduced, its location discussed and snippets of information are sprinkled into the viewers ear and if there are interesting historical or social footnotes relating to the lighthouse those are included too. These are most often in the nature of discussion of some boating tragedy in the area. Lighthouse keepers and members of historical societies are given the chance to speak about some of the structures in question and in some instances the workmanship and construction methods are discussed. All this is wrapped up in some nice footage of Australian coastlines and some of these structures are in very pretty locations.

This won't bore the pants off you with details of architectural foibles nor is the DVD equivalent of a coffee table book. It isn't a treatise on Australian maritime or social history. It is a little of each and if you are interested enough in such a product to be perusing its page here then you can probably buy safely, it's cheap enough after all and a curio subject.",1376611200,,1526,4.910852713178294
