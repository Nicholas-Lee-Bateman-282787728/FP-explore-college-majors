8683309,5,B00ODUOYGY,"A master piece of Spain's movie industry. The acting, the correct use and pronunciation  of the old Castilian language,the  production values, the settings (old castles, convents and cathedrals) yet in existence from those days (15th and 16tcenturies). The suave display of the cameras' movements and last but not less the background music makes this production
something extraordinary. Beside this we are relating ourselves to the life and times of the greatest Queen in the history of
the world, that ever lived. She constructed Spain as one and solid nation. The story is, as far as our knowledge goes i
accurate.
-Isabel la Catlica. Had she  being British more, across the world would have being known and appreciated of this giant of
Spain history, creator of the first ever, nation-state, who manage  to make Spain a truly Spanish per se conglomerate of otsne,
people.
One, Big and Free (of foreign occupation). ... and if this hasn't been such achievement, still She had time to impulse the discovery of a
New World; but that's theme for another day.",1523232000,,1057,4.988636363636363
