5942958,2,B00ET6K40C,"My review isn't so much on the movies (which are all top-notch) as it is the product (the 3-disc Blu-ray box set), itself.  I bought the trilogy expecting to be able to download the digital version of each movie.  I went to the Universal Ultraviolet website and attempted to enter the first code.  I received an error message stating that the code is only valid in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  I then attempted to enter the other two codes, and received the same message.  I contacted Universal, offering to give them my invalid codes in exchange for ones that would work in the US, and they replied with the following message:

""You seem to have purchased a UK package. Unfortunately, we cannot assist you.  As noted on the authorization code insert, this Digital Copy/UltraViolet feature requires that the '...customer must reside in the United Kingdom or ROI.'

Some third-party vendors sell products that are imported from other countries - with expired offers or with offers that are valid only in the country of origin.  Please contact Amazon Customer Support for further assistance.""

In other words, I'm out of luck.  I'm going to contact Amazon Customer Support to see what, if anything, can be done to remedy the situation, but I'm not planning on having much luck.  I double checked the packaging, the insert, and the product page to see if maybe I missed where it said the included download codes are only valid in the UK/Ireland.  I found it - but only on the insert (in the small print) and on the outside case (in even smaller print), neither of which are visible on the product photos.  Nowhere on the product page does it say that the codes aren't valid in the US.

To sum up, if you're buying this set because it's an awesome deal for 3 Blu-rays as well as 3 downloads, don't - it's not what you're getting.  The only reason I'm giving this product two stars is because I love the movies.",1407888000,9,1910,4.623145400593472

5942960,5,B00ET6K40C,"Yeah, baby, yeah. Edgar Wright's love poems to the films that he grew up with may be the greatest film trilogy in cinema history. They're more exciting than ""Star Wars"", more hilarious than the ""Monty Python"" movies, provoke as much debate as Kieslowski's ""Three Colors"" and are every bit as artistic as Satyajit Ray's ""Apu"" films. These three movies are killer comedy, each one turning their respective genres on their head while delivering an abundance of laughs to those who need a good funny-bone fix. Best of all, they're on a Blu-Ray set that dazzles in visual resolution, audio quality and supplements. The ""Flavours Cornetto"" movies belong in every Blu-Ray collection. And if you don't like them, then in the words of Simon Pegg, ""Get Out!""",1400803200,,748,4.944444444444445
5942961,4,B00ET6K40C,Overall the movies are 100% perfect I've been a huge fan of their films since Shawn of the dead. However the digital copy's of the movies won't work unless you're in the UK or Ireland which sucks big time. Other then that great collection!,1466726400,,239,4.454545454545454
5942962,4,B00ET6K40C,"First is about this package then about the movies... First thing to read... If you buy from this vender and you are in the USA, you will not get to use your Ultraviolet codes. I eventually had to use TunnelBear to make it work. It was not mentioned in the description that this would be the case. It is a UK product, not US.

That said... This is Edgar Write in full on awesomeness.  I had seen Hot Fuzz before, but not the other 2. I loved HF, and had a great time with Worlds End too. I had no idea what it was about, but having enjoyed all his other films, I didn't watch any previews or read about it. I am so glad I did it that way, and if you don't know about it, DON'T read about it, you will thank me later. Just watch it. Shaun of the Dead was fun, but I think I am a little over the zombie thing, so it's not the movies fault, just burn out within the flavor.",1465084800,,869,3.8764044943820224
5942963,5,B00ET6K40C,"This is amazing. Exactly what I was looking for. They do not have a region lock on these movies, so you can play these movies on any Blu Ray player. The only bad thing is that the Digital HD codes only work in the UK and Ireland.",1460419200,2,229,3.893617021276596
5942964,2,B00ET6K40C,"Movies are great, if you are buying for digital and live in the us, they will not work... you need to live in the UK for the download to work.
