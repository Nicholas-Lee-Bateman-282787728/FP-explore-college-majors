8316707,3,B001KZVQ8O,"I just got this DVD and I was disappointed by the lack of substance. The guys who build these cars to compete against one-another are given 2 days to do the work, even though they've never really worked on turbocharged cars. There hardly are any details as to the products they are using, and even less details as to how to install them.

They do provide a little bit of decent history on Grand Nationals and the GNX, so that's the good part. But if you are thinking (or hoping) that this short, made-for-TV show, will give you info on how to get your Grand National to perform even better than the day it rolled out of the assembly line, think again! These ""souped up"" GNs are shadows of the originals. Darn shame.

However, for only a few bucks, I guess you could do far worse, so I am giving it a 3-star rating.

But, if you want a far-better documentary on the history of the Buick Grand National and the GNX, you want to check out ""Black Air."" Although the DVD is not available here, if you are a Prime member you can watch it for free (extras are not included though).",1375660800,,1074,4.280788177339901
