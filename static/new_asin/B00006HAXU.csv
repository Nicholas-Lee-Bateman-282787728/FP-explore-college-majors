7968787,5,B00006HAXU,"I've enjoyed many Globe Trekker episodes in the past, but this one outdid them all. Not only from an entertainment perspective, but from a - Oh My Gosh! - perspective. This 2 hour DVD visits sites in 25 countries - all of them UN World Heritage sites (Read: spectacular) most likely.

This DVD shows us 1st hand, the remains of our previously failed experiments in trying to build a sustainable society. I have traveled extensively to 35+ countries all over the world for many months at a time - as a backpacker and businessperson - and was still impressed with this DVD. There were quite a few places I had never even heard of (Despite having the 2005 official UN World Heritage Map on a wall!). Leptis Magna in Libya was particularly interesting to view.

Seeing the collage of all these places at once, helps to connect the dots of what they all mean. If you enjoy this video you may enjoy reading A Short History of Progress by Ronald Wright (Only 132 pages!), and Why We Lie by David Livingstone Smith.

As for DVDs - other titles to enjoy are Globe Trekker Great Festivals, Frontline Persuaders, Charcoal People, Commanding Heights, National Geographic's Strange Days on Planet Earth, and NG's Beyond the Movie series for Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring, and Return of the King. As for fiction - Rapa Nui - which is another name for Easter Island, the last destination on this DVD.",1132790400,12,1398,4.606425702811245
