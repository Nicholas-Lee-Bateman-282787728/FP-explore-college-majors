8133879,1,B000GQMLCI,The vhs jumps up and down in the middle and you can't see a lot of it.....I bought it so a friend of mine could put it on a dvd but it is useless the way it is. I don't understand why the other three dvd's play perfectly and this one won't work...because the dvd didn't work is why I bought the vhs tape...so buying the dvd and the vhs tape was a total loss.....,1453766400,,362,3.84

8133882,2,B000GQMLCI,"This weird and wacky combination of THE SHINING meets DAS BOOT features
a rusted old Nazi torture vessel that goes around sinking luxury liners and then picking up the survivors to kill them and live off their life force.
Has some rotting corpses on deck and blood but few kills and a cast better suited for Love Boat then Death Ship...Still not awful and much better then
Ghost Ship 1 and half stars.

8133883,1,B000GQMLCI,Time hasn't been kind to this sad sack tale of shipwreck survivors finding a boat floating near them. The boat is the title vessel and the Nazis used it as a torcher ship. Silly plot and poor execution rob what little spark it might have had. Really poor all around,1176768000,,265,4.32
8133884,4,B000GQMLCI,"I definetly remember this movie back in the early 80""s when I was 13-14 years old and it was quite creepy but well done I thought. Once the difters did board this old creepy ship-all kinds of twists and turn games begin, and they did scare me! the music, scenery, and expressions on the people faces were scary, I thought it was well done without all the blood and gore like todays newer films, I intend to but this video too beacuse Iam a nostalgic junkie for classics like this!",1126656000,,480,4.344444444444444
