367784,3,6301777700,"The film dramatises the last days and eventual suicide of Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker during April 1945. It was made for English TV back in 1973 but both the color and sound have transferred well to DVD. This was probably the earliest of a number of dramatised versions of Hitler's last days and suffers a bit in comparison to later productions but it is still an interesting and well performed drama. Note that since this production, a number of distinguished actors have portrayed Hitler on screen: Sir Alec Guinness (Hitler: The Last Ten Days), Sir Derek Jacobi (Inside the Third Reich), Sir Anthony Hopkins (The Bunker) and Bruno Ganz (Downfall).

In this version the very talented English actor Frank Finlay takes on the role of Hitler and not only gives a powerful performance as the raging and manic Fuhrer but also shows a more subdued and cynical character, particularly in scenes with his long-time mistress Eva Braun. In 1974 Frank Finlay deservedly won the British equivalent of an American Emmy for this role. Caroline Mortimer's portrayal of Eva Braun as a bright, lively and likeable young woman is also effective; so much so you start feeling sorry that she will soon die by Hitler's side. Much of the private dialogue between Hitler and Eva is obviously fictitious but the screenwriter (Vincent Tilsey) provides us with an interesting view of their strange relationship and, in the end, who can say what went on behind those closed doors. The rest of the cast work well to bring the other characters in the bunker to life, particularly Ed Devereaux as the creepy Martin Bormann. The problem is that most of the time we have no idea who these people are and what they do. Unless you have some prior knowledge of these events and can make educated guesses, this is certainly annoying. Yet the opening scene starts with a narrator who then fades away when he is most needed.

There are some historical inaccuracies in this production. The scene where Dr. Gebhardt (Head of the German Red Cross) explains that a lampshade in Hitler's study is made from human skin is pure invention. Even among all the horrors of the Holocaust, no evidence of this specific crime has ever been found. The scene where Hitler verbally abuses his secretaries for mislaying the order to physically liquidate the European Jews is also pure invention. According to the memoirs of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, he was always kind and courteous to his female staff right to the end. However, more importantly, we know from so many confirmed sources that this particular order to Himmler was verbal and was never put in writing. In any event, if Hitler had really wanted to claim responsibility for the murder of the Jews, he had the opportunity in his final political testament but failed to do so.",1208476800,12,2805,4.817427385892116
7815637,5,6301777700,"Great movie, hidden gem, classic, and true treasure.  This is hitler's final days, full of anger, insecurity and losing sanity.  He's raving mad, and yelling at everyone.  As other reviewers have said, who knows if its historically accurate, but I tend to grant creative licenses to any director portraying a man that commitsmass genocide as crazy, and losing it... especially as ally forces advance and his empire falls apart..  Couldnt be more entertaining, especially when he goes off the rails.",1508371200,,498,5.1875
7815638,1,6301777700,"Not good at all. Der Fuhrer looks like Bob Denver (Gilligan). Should not have been made/produced/filmed. Thank God I have ""Downfall.""",1502064000,,133,5.380952380952381
7815639,3,6301777700,I saw this movie years ago. It kind of comical in some ways. Perhaps it was meant to be a kind of satire. It definitely inferior in all ways to Downfall.,1489622400,,153,3.967741935483871

7815641,4,6301777700,"This plays more like a stage play and british documentary but it's still good. The story takes place inside
the bunker and shows Hitler going more and more out of touch and insane as he learns Berlin is being
attacked and it's only a matter of time til the enemy finds the bunker. The actor playing Hitler does a
really good job and it's pretty creepy and disturbing performance. The story moves a little slow at times
but if you like movies about the Nazis and Hitler instead of the basic WWII movies you will like this.",1402790400,2,521,4.381443298969073
7815642,1,6301777700,"This was a terrible production  It was dreadful to watch and cannot be taken seriously by any historian.  The acting is woeful, one-dimensional and it is more of a parody.  After watching the excellent 'Downfall' ( Der Untergang) I was shaking my head in disbelief at many of the scenes in this shoddy movie.",1401494400,2,308,4.666666666666667
7815643,5,6301777700,"A pretty good showing of Hitler's last days and worth seeing for anyone interested on the subject.
I am keeping it with my other movies on the matter.",1356480000,3,150,4.392857142857143
7815644,5,6301777700,"I've been studying the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich for about forty years...off and on of course. I've probably viewed every movie made about Hitler, W.W.II, The Holocaust, etc. I've read quite a few books as well but only a fraction of what has been published. Frank Finlay is absolutely perfect in his portrayal of the Fhrer.  The whole cast is superb.  I've watched this movie at least a dozen times over the past few years.  Each and every time is a new and wonderful experience.  I am always more than satisfied, always learning and experiencing something new and unique; something more to ponder. No movie has ever held my fascination as this English Drama.  I like American movies but when it comes to drama, the English are clearly superior.  What else?  Shakespeare is all that's left.  I recommend this movie 100%.  I bought two copies from Amazon...one to lend out of course.  I now have one.  It wasn't too long ago when copies were very rare.  I remember quite well one being available for ""only"" $100.00.  Grab your copy.  Get a VCR if you must.  It will be well worth it.",1307923200,4,1090,4.546391752577319
7815645,1,6301777700,"Recently I saw this British TV production from early 1973 to compare with: ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days""; ""The Bunker"" and ""Downfall"" (A/K/A Der Untergang). Of the four, it is by far the worst. It's hard to know where to begin. The production is cheap, has choppy edits and scenes, simplistic ""wooden"" portrayals, and puts forth a blatant agenda shown in contrived scenes throughout. Hitler is one dimensional and over the top in presentation (to a higher degree than even Sir Alec Guinness in the one star production of ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days""); a tough feat. The acting is sadly comical. Hitler comes across as an insistent child; no flashes of the strong charismatic leader. Hitler goes around either - yelling, crying, or telling people, ""...are you mad?!""

An example of the production: Dr. Goebbels and Hitler are sitting at a small table when they look at each other and then start pounding the table with their fists and yelling, ""Blood, blood, blood, blood, blood!"" They then laugh as if they were Dr. Evil from an Austin Powers movie.

In this version, principle players of the last days are missing. Eva scolds Adolf in the bedroom; Speer yells at Hitler and ""dresses him down."" Goring with a bad toupee cries like a baby at a military conference. I could go on but will just say, it pales beyond belief next to ""Downfall""; especially if one has read more then Hugh Trevor-Roper's old book on the subject (see my review of that book) or seen the other Hitler films. It really is like watching a bad soap opera. I just wish I could give it zero stars.

At least the presentations of Hitler's last days have gotten better with every attempt. This one is by far the least accurate and worst as far as acting and production quality. Next in line is ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"", which is almost a parody of the facts (see my review of that film) but rates higher then this one. Then would come the HBO production ""The Bunker"", with Sir Anthony Hopkins. The best and most accurate film to date on the subject is the German feature film, ""Downfall"" (A/K/A Der Untergang).",1240531200,16,2077,4.623306233062331
7815646,5,6301777700,Arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.  Looking forward to viewing it.,1210809600,,81,4.785714285714286
