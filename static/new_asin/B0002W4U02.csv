2128512,3,B0002W4U02,"JIGSAW has just enough going for it to merit recommendation, with emphasis on the word `just.'  It's a ramshackle story of an assistant New York City district attorney (Franchot Tone) who's hot on the trail of the shadowy racist hate group, the Crusaders.

  With low-key photography and acting, JIGSAW has a naturalistic look and feel to it.  It's one of those late 40's gray city movies that included scenes taking place in real locations - real dirty city streets with real cats rummaging through overflowing trash cans.

  There's a mystery behind the confused mystery the movie presents.  While Tone's character is investigating what was then a stereotypical Communist group, JIGSAW includes a number of cameos by prominent stars, many of who were targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) as belonging to subversive organizations prior to World War II.  It was a time of loyalty oaths and black-listings, so perhaps the cameo stars appeared to indicate their opposition to such organizations as the Crusaders.  Two of the cameo stars belonged to the Committee for the First Amendment, which publicly called for the abolishment of HUAC, so perhaps the ""harmless lunatics"" who support mob-run rackets like the Crusaders aren't Trotskyites after all.  Considering the political manipulations this movie exposes, you might even interpret the Crusaders as a front for a HUAC-like politician.

  Such is the sea this movie swims in.  There's the Good Girl brunette and the Bad Girl Blonde, the political fixer and the exasperated boss.  Standard stuff ably handled and nicely photographed.  I won't spoil the surprise by naming any of the cameo stars, but the first one appears about 15 minutes into the movie.",1101081600,11,1730,5.184115523465704
8033684,2,B0002W4U02,"Remastering? I THINK NOT!!!
Horrible transfer of movie with all the defects in glorious view. Lots of clicks, lines running throughout film, jumping scenes, poor definition.
The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it has Marlene's Dietrich's cameo which is less than 10 seconds!!!!! I needed this to be able to have a complete collection of all her talkies (I Loved A Soldier was never completed and from what I understand only a few stills remain from this production). AND!!!! THE CAMEO has lines running right though her appearance and face!!!!
WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!",1514937600,,577,4.8979591836734695
8033685,4,B0002W4U02,The theme of this movie is the influence of hate speech and it is once again relevant today.,1461196800,,92,4.166666666666667
8033686,3,B0002W4U02,"This was a strange movie in that is seems to have been conceived as a propaganda piece to confront hate groups that hid behind patriotism. I am not precisely sure what specific movement this movie was confronting in 1949 America - social Darwinism and fascism are singled out as the specific philosophies, though - but the flick is worse for it as it makes the first half of the movie seem like one of those film lectures you would get in social studies. I think the producers recognized this because they helped the medicine go down by sneaking in cameos from a number of big stars in the first half (Henry Fonda, Burgess Meredith, and Marlene Dietrich to name just three!). However, I have to say the second half of the movie was MUCH better as the propaganda part was largely dropped, with the movie focusing on the core ""whodunit"" that started the movie when a printer, and then an investigative journalist, is murdered. This second half is absolutely stolen by the lovely Jean Wallace who plays the femme fatale & gunmoll Barbara Whitfield, with co-star Franchot Tone giving a solid but unremarkable performance as an assistant district attorney investing the murders. Lastly, this movie had a contrived but fun shootout in an art gallery, which may be a first for any film noir I've seen. Jigsaw is another ""B movie"" that gets a...""B"" from me. Fun, but nothing great.",1461024000,,1373,4.725
8033687,4,B0002W4U02,I really liked this movie.  It's a good example of Film Noir.,1454716800,2,61,4.083333333333333
8033688,5,B0002W4U02,This is a good old movie.  A lot of familiar faces as cameos.  Loved watching it as a late Saturday night movie.,1447200000,,112,4.045454545454546
8033689,4,B0002W4U02,It may be a low budget film but it's clear to see that everyone involved was seriously committed to a film that spoke out against race-baiting hate groups in post-war America.,1435017600,,175,4.67741935483871

8033691,2,B0002W4U02,How can they say digitally remastered when it is not!  This is no better then any other public domain copy!  I gave it 2 stars because it is watchable.,1422921600,2,151,4.172413793103448
8033692,3,B0002W4U02,"""Jigsaw"" opens on a big city. A ship's whistle sounds. A lone man walks on the sidewalk. There is a shot. Was it a suicide? Is there a connection to the ""Crusaders""? Are they a racket? Charlie Riggs is an investigative reporter. ""Fear is a terrible weapon."" Will somebody shut Riggs up and make it look like a suicide? But his briefcase is missing. Howard Malloy investigates a name. Will he be attacked in his apartment? Malloy visits the Mohawk Political Club to meet The Angel. Later he visits a warehouse to learn more about the ""Crusaders"". Grace Hartley meets Malloy and says he will be appointed ""Special Prosecutor"". Widow Borg will be kept as a material witness.

Malloy meets powerful people at a cocktail party. Does one man have fascist sympathies? Malloy meets Barbara Whitfield, the singer. A photo is taken and is printed in a newspaper. Is there a hidden purpose? We learn more about the scheme. It is a well-laid trap to ruin Malloy! But no plan is perfect, and Kosterich shows up. Kosterich has hidden the evidence behind one of his paintings at the museum. Who will go and get it? Shots are fired, some are killed, the good guys survive for a happy ending.

This is a good film that would have benefitted from a bigger budget and a better script. It shows how the wealthy and powerful use politicians and criminals to accomplish their goals. This story obscures the purposes behind these actions.",1261612800,,1415,4.678714859437751
8033693,3,B0002W4U02,"This movie is a film noir classic It concerns a quest to find out who is behind a hate group which is run by murderers and power mongers. Franchot Tone is the Assistant District Attorney and Special Prosecutor who must do battle with these forces of evil.

 The tone is dead serious about the dangers of prejudice and hate. There are some comments about the need for tolerance and understanding. Similar in a way to movies of the time, like ""Crossfire"" and ""Home of the Brave"", Jigsaw is an interesting movie. There are many twists and turns in the plot and the acting is good.

Winifred Lenihan (in her only movie performance) shines, as does Jean Wallace as the femme fatale. The print is murky, but the photography is good, with some unusual close-ups.

Jigsaw has a special treat for movie fans. There are cameos from Burgess Meredith, Henry Fonda, John Garfield, Marsha Hunt and Marlene Dietrich. They are lending themselves to the cause of anti-fascism, but they do it in a humorous way. Some of them mug towards the camera and it is fun to try to identify them. Jigsaw is a film noir with a different slant.",1138924800,6,1114,4.582914572864322
