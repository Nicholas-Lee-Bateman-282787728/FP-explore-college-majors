8752733,5,B01CDT62OI,"Being a fan of westerns and comedy and an obsessed fan of Maverick, this was a find for me. The three disks include the ""pilot,"" the 1978 movie, The New Maverick, with James Garner and brief appearances of Jack Kelly. I enjoyed seeing Garner and Kelly 16 years after the original. Kelly seems kind of beat, but Garner is the same Maverick. The film is flawed by the bad background music so common in the 1970's (think snare drum and trumpets playing semi-randomly) but great sets and in color.  IMDB incorrectly says James Garner is in the first episode, ""Clancy."" Bret Maverick is mentioned but Garner does not appear. The series includes a number of recognizable actors who had storied careers in TV and film. In ""Clancy,"" the opposing boxer is played by Burton Gilliam, who played Lyle, Taggert's sidekick, who had some of the funniest lines in Blazing Saddles. The series recurring Marshal Troy is played by John Dehner, who played the crooked banker in ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres,"" arguably the best of the original Maverick and a precursor to The Sting. James Woods is in two episodes and you will see a number of very recognizable guest players. Don't get me wrong, Young Maverick isn't Maverick. Nothing is. Just the pilot movie was worth the price of admission.",1525564800,,1270,4.746606334841629

8752739,2,B01CDT62OI,"Young Maverick: The Complete Series was an attempt to recapture  twenty years later  some of the magic of Maverick, one of the biggest TV hits of the late 1950s that starred James Garner as gambler Bret Maverick.

The title character of Young Maverick is  Ben Maverick (Charles Frank), the son of Brets first cousin Beau Maverick. Ben is Harvard-educated and inherited the familys good looks and charm along with its traditions of gambling, willingness to bend the law whenever profitable, and the belief that cowardice was the best way to avoid being killed on the rough frontier. With the help of original series stars James Garner and Jack Kelly, the character of Ben was introduced in a TV movie called The New Maverick (included in this collection) that served as pilot for the new series.

Bens frequent nemesis, partner, and romantic interest, Nell McGarrahan (Susan Blanchard), is a sharp grifter in her own right who hopes to marry Ben one day. Marshal Edge Troy (John Dehner) always seems to be on hand to protect Ben from bodily harm. He had arrested Bens father many years earlier. All business, Marshal Troy never understood Bens humor.

Unfortunately, the magic was never recaptured. Charles Frank didn't have that twinkle and attitude that made the original Bret Maverick so popular.  Though he did his best, he was merely a serviceable character with not a lot of charisma. The stories, for the most part, were routine variations of stories that had been part of the original series.

Mr. Frank and Ms. Blanchard were already well acquainted before the series aired. They spent a number of years playing husband and wife on the ABC daytime soap opera, All My Children, and were married in real life.

Young Maverick premiered on November 28, 1979. Its final broadcast was January 16, 1980. Only six hour-long episodes were aired, leaving two that were filmed but never shown. All eight episodes appear in this set. Guest stars include James Woods, Donna Mills, George Dzundza, Howard Duff, Harry Dean Stanton, and Morgan Fairchild.",1460419200,6,2047,4.961988304093567
8752740,3,B01CDT62OI,"Surprisingly I liked these episodes of the 1979 revival of the Maverick TV series much more than I expected.  Being a devoted fan of the original series, I have pursued every opportunity to acquire all productions of this legendary franchise.  Realizing that the ABC TV movie, ""The New Maverick"" that served as a pilot for this TV series was mediocre at best, my expectations for this limited run series were marginal.  Upon viewing the 8 episodes (including 2 episodes that never aired initially), I was pleasantly surprised at the details suggesting deference to the original series concept.  Such details included the continuing use of the original theme song with an updated arrangement, the town and ranch scene sets, the costumes, the casting, the screenplays showing card playing, and moving the Maverick character from town to town each week.  It was also a great touch to include the great character actor, John Dehner as Marshall Edge Troy.  John Dehner appeared in arguably the most famous episode from the original series, Shady Deal at Sunny Acres.

Even though this short series revival suffered from some of the same shortcomings as other attempts to update the Maverick character, it had an underlying authenticity sadly lacking from the miserable formulaic Bret Maverick series that aired for one season, two years later on NBC.  All attempts at reviving Maverick, including the theatrical release starring Mel Gibson, have simply played the comedy too broadly, rendering the shows much too silly.  The original series, created by Roy Huggins, wrote Maverick as a serious western anti-hero character who would do almost anything to avoid conflict and inconvenience but NOT as a con artist coward as subsequent efforts suggested.  When pressed by circumstances in the original Maverick storylines, our main character always stood up to the bad guys, often finding ways to outsmart them.

In the Young Maverick series, Charles Frank looked the part and played it as well as he could under the circumstances.  The bad guys in each episode had enough of an edge to make them appear to be a believable threat within the story line and Ben Maverick always showed an appropriate Maverick concern for bringing them to some sort of frontier justice.  The fatal flaw of this series was including a female tag-a-long character named Nell McGarrahan, played by Susan Blanchard, the real life wife of the lead actor Charles Frank.  Even though she was a very pretty face to grace the screen in each episode, her character basically just served to distract from the storyline and also created a silly kid-show type of framework in the series.  Remove that character and provide a little more seriousness to the Maverick role and this series would have been a successful revival of the original show regardless of the length of its run on CBS-TV in 1979.

One huge disappointment in the release of this series on DVD is that, for some odd reason, it did not include the well documented first 15 second scene from the opening episode that aired on November 28, 1979.  That scene showed Ben Maverick having a chance encounter with Bret Maverick played in a cameo by James Garner.  In this scene, Bret said to Ben ""expect to see more of me"" in your travels.  I cannot image why it was not included in the DVD unless it was somehow filmed separately from the episode in which it appeared and served as more of a teaser promo to build interest in the new series.  Whether it was ""lost"" within the Warner Brothers vault or not included for some other reason, it was still a great disappointment not to have been included in this package.

Overall this series was a surprisingly good attempt to revive Maverick from the 1950's, especially when compared to the Bret Maverick series from 2 years later.  Fans of the original Maverick TV show will likely enjoy this very limited run series which has not been seen in almost 40 years.  One final note is that the best episode in the series is ""Dead Man's Hand"" which aired as a two part episode on the 4th and 5th weeks of the series after 3 other episodes had already aired.  It seems obvious that this was intended to be an extended 2 hour premier of the series because of the inclusion of introductory devices for a number of issues including the continuing character of Nell McGarrahan.",1459123200,9,4331,4.845318860244233
