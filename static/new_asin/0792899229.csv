156909,5,0792899229,"I watched both ""Jean de Florette"" and ""Manon des Sources"" as a part of my French class this year.  I have never seen better films.  The acting is incredible and truly, I didn't even notice  that I was reading subtitles.  The views of the Provencal countryside are  beautiful.  The movies are among the saddest that I have seen, but they are  masterpieces of their time.",952387200,3,369,4.584615384615384
156910,5,0792899229,"Not to be missed.  This is one of those sub-titled movies that you watch and don't even realize it's sub-titled -- kind of like The Red Violin, another of my all-time favorites.

156911,5,0792899229,"A masterpiece especially after watching its equally wonderful and surprising sequel, Manon of the Spring. The realism and attention to detail not to mention the scenery make the difference.  The story starts as a city  man moves his family to the countryside of Provence to start a new life.  His enthusiasm for this venture is contagious but eventually is not enough.  Auteuil, Depardieu, Montand are marvelous in their roles.",912816000,,427,5.144927536231884

there should be part 2. But, this next film is not to be found on Amazon Prime. I checked out the titles ""Manon of the Spring,"" which would be
the logical choice for part 2, but this is not available on Amazon. If there is a different title that I should be searching for I wish someone
would suggest it to me. At the end of this film, the young daughter, Manon, witnesses the 2 evil neighbors unplugging the spring on the property. The knowledge of this spring was kept hidden from her parents by the 2 neighbors; and this spring could have saved her father's life and also the family if they had known about it.",1461024000,2,787,4.116883116883117

156934,5,0792899229,"Jean De Florette and its sequel, Manon Des Sources, are my favorite French films and high on my list of all favorites.

Jean De Florette stands well on its own as a drama about idealistic dreams vs. insular self-interest.  The plot revolves around  a city man who inherits a rundown farm in the french countryside who moves there with his wife and young daughter to pursue the dream of an idealized country life.  He comes into contact with the two remaining family members of an old local faming family who have their sights set on owning the same farm, and the drama unfolds from there.  When combined with its sequel, Manon Des Sources, the dramatic story of Jean De Florette attains Shakespearean proportions and delivers a moving story you will never forget.

Fine performances are delivered by the entire cast.",1456531200,3,816,4.792857142857143

I wish Amazon would make the sequel--Manon des Sources--available.  This is just part one; it's frustrating not to be able to follow it up with part two.

156949,2,0792899229,"I gave it two stars because of the excellent acting and the cinematography. I don't like the message of this film which seems to be very anti-morality and anti-God. It's like the story of Job, but without Job being rewarded by God in the end. The message of this film is that there is no reward for being good and there are no consequences for being evil.

In my oppinion, Jean de Florette is an enjoyable example of the brilliance of how well Acted, written, produced and anyone involved in the making of this Film makes normal people love watching a teamwork of film making craft.

BTW, read the Good Reviews about it, it's a great Movie (2 set).
Now, the BAD reviews are about the VIDEO and Subs quality, not the quality of the Film or Actors, it is confusing, so, careful where you get it from, it's Not HD, but still enjoyable for the content of a very well made Drama.

156981,5,0792899229,"If a perfect film exists, it is perhaps Jean de Florette, a masterful film of stark contrasts in Post-World War I France.

This is a brilliant film of contrasts. On the one hand is the breathtaking beauty of the Provence near Marseilles. On the other the is devilish, calculated manipulation of Cesar (Yves Montand), who, with the assistance of his dim-witted nephew (Daniel Auteuil), covets and ultimately acquires property inherited by a newcomer (Gerard Depardieu) by encouraging his vulnerabilities.

Another contrast is the pure enthusiasm and goodwill of the newcomer to his new home, and, on the other, the craven cunning of Cesar.  All three actors give iconic preformances. The cunning of Cesar is brilliantly portrayed by Montand, the defining role of his long career.

Jean de Florette is the first part of its sequel, Manon of the Springs. Both films should be viewed together for the full effect. Manon of the Springs holds a secret that is not revealed until the very end. It will blow the viewer away.",1391126400,,1016,4.958823529411765

156988,5,0792899229,"Two part film, that was 1st released as two separate features.  Terrific telling of a complex story of intertwined farming families in rural France in the early part of the 20th century.

The acting is mostly of the highest order.  Yves Montand, one of the most suave men in history is completely believable as a rough hewn, self-centered farmer, Gerard Depardieu, also cast against type, as a gentle, educated city born man trying to make it as a farmer also is astounding.  Almost as good is Daniel Auteuil as Montand's not-very-bright son.

 Only Emmanuelle Beart, gorgeous though she may be,  doesn't quite convince me as the wild woman of the fields. Some of it is performance, some of it is how perfect she looks.

The story is wonderful in a Dickensian sort of way, with clues and character elements showing up early, only to pay off three hours later.  I love the first part even more, somehow it feels more truly tragic and dense, the 2nd part just a bit too neat by the end.

But mainly, the characters are so interesting and the plot reversal so surprising that you watch in amazement.  Also, there's great sympathy for the both of the main characters and how thing go so differently from what they expect.  Depardieu and Auteuil are stunning.",1336521600,,462,4.679012345679013

With its sequel,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manon-of-the-Spring/dp/B000053VBP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manon of the Spring</a>&nbsp;(Manon Des Sources) [DVD], it tells a bittersweet tale of life among the peasantry of the time. It is based on a novel, with which I am not familiar, by Marcel Pagnol, with whose work, I regret, I am also not familiar, tho I believe he was a screenwriter of note. It was adapted for the screen and directed by Claude Berri. The original score was written, and performed by Jean-Claude Petit and his orchestra; there are musical snatches throughout of the opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-La-Forza-del-Destino/dp/B000009NIX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: La Forza del Destino</a>by Guiseppi Verdi.

Central to the tale are the schemings of Cesar Soubeyran, known as ""Le Papet"" locally, wealthy, almost last survivor of a dynasty of hard-working, successful peasants, and treated with great respect in the village. As played by the magnetic, older Yves Montand, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wages-Of-Fear-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B001PYD0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wages Of Fear - (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>];<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diabolique-The-Criterion-Collection-Spine-35/dp/0780021940/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diabolique (The Criterion Collection) Spine #35)</a>), he is as hard a man as his long life has made him. Then, his possibly not all there nephew Ugolin, played by Daniel Auteil, always so successful at playing not particularly bright characters (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Closet/dp/B00005OSLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Closet</a>) comes home from his stint in the army. The older man is anxious to see his nephew married, with children, settled locally, and making a living before his illnesses end his life. Accordingly, Cesar has his eye on a plot of land that adjoins his holdings, and several healthy looking girls in the village.

But the land the Soubeyran family covets is sold to an outsider, a tax collector civil servant; a luckless hunchback played by the magnificent Gerard Depardieu, (&nbsp;).who comes bearing some regulation outsiders' French name, and a family to support. However, if Jean had been called by the name he should have been in the village, had they known who he really was, he would have been known locally as Jean de Florette, the title character. At any rate, the Soubeyrons, Cesar and Ugolin, pretend to befriend and help the naive and generous hunchback, who is inexperienced in farming, but has many ambitious plans, some of which are entirely unsuited for the location. Nevertheless,the Soubeyrons secretly work against the would-be farmer, most importantly by depriving him of water.

Greedy, cruel behavior to be sure, with tragic consequences. The film may be thought to have dated a bit, to be a bit too reliant on coincidence. Still, it seems to me grounded in reality. We watch the first telephones and automobiles creep into town, the appearance of new styles of dress. And I believe that French peasants, any peasants really, have historically wanted only certain things: land, with water on it; real gold, not paper scrip, and the success and survival of their families. The film, which was nominated for a Golden Globe, and won several other awards, is moving, its visual leitmotif, of red carnations, will stick in the mind; and it gains immeasurable power from the outstanding performances of its three stars.",1285113600,,3873,6.222014925373134

156993,5,0792899229,"Jean de Florette is a moving and poignant story of a city tax collector who recently inherits land and a home for his wife and daughter. He loves nature, has farming knowledge, follows a plan, and exudes a desire to become successful and profitable.  What he is unaware is that he is up against an evil landowner Cesar Soubeyran and his nephew, Ugolin, who with greed, scheme and plot to take the land away.

The soil is rich, but the supply for water has been plugged by Soubeyran and Ugolin.  As Ugolin, the middleman sets up the evil deeds, he watches with interest how de Florette's farming techniques prove successful.  He provides assistance, loaning his mule and water to Florette.  Impressed, Ugolin tends to show a little more heart than his uncle Soubeyran.  Every step is a challenge as Florette manages his plan, addresses struggles, loses the land's water, and yet he still prays for rain. He is driven to the ultimate torment with devastating consequences.

The acting by the main actors, Montand, Depardieu and Auteil brings a greater depth to the story of good versus evil.

I'm not quite sure what the appeal is to this movie, but it's definitely there. I've watched this several times in the past 15 years and always got involved with it....and it's companion piece, ""Manon of the Spring."" If given a choice, I prefer the latter movie, only perhaps because this is a frustrating story, seeing a good man get ruined simply for greed.

Both stories are well-done.

This tragic tale of two greedy people driving a nice man and his family off their land is not only frustrating but sad, especially since their is no happy ending, with the man dying while trying to salvage his property. The second film is years later when the daughter, now grown up, gets revenge.

Gerald Depardieu is the nice guy here, the one we all root for while Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil are the greedy jerks. These three are famous French actors who always give their audiences good performances.

A big plus in this film is the very nice cinematography, which is why I bought this when it first came out on DVD. This is a fine visual movie, not just  good storytelling.",1235952000,,1116,4.582914572864322

Stunningly picturesque, ""Jean"" reaches a high watermark for period drama.",1183939200,,539,5.506024096385542
156998,5,0792899229,"I have a general rule when it comes to Gerard Depardieu, if he's playing sexy then pass but if he's playing a character then keep.

Depardieu is the title character in Jean de Florette.  Jean has inherited his mother's family farm.  He is bringing his wife and young daughter Magnon.  Jean did not grow up in the area so even though it is his family farm, he is an outsider. To further complicate things, he has a slight hunchback, which the villagers take as a curse.

Caesar (Yves Montand), the farmer next door and his nephew (Daniel Auteuil) would like to buy the land and expand their holdings. But Jean looks at this as a chance to build a new life and refuses.  Therefore Caesar plots to force Jean out, including stopping up his spring.

Jean's new life is hard but he makes it work.  That is until there is a drought.  Jean eventually works himself to death.  His widow sales the farm to Caesar.  The final scene is Caesar and his nephew unplugging the spring but unknown to them, little Magnon sees this.

Claude Beri is on of the great French directors.  He has captured the flavor the rural France at the turn of the century.  This is Depardieu's finest performance and is the first film that brought future French superstar Daniel Auteuil to the American filmgoer.  And it is nice to see Yves Montand again.

This is part one of two films call Pagnol's Water Stories.  The second is the even better, Magnon of the Springs.  But both films stand alone and you do not need to see both - but it is recommended.

156999,5,0792899229,"This movie has the simple feel of a provincial or pastoral folktale. A farmer, Le Papet (played by Yves Montand) and his nephew, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) scheme against the city inheritor, Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu) of a neighboring farm, keeping secret from him the whereabouts of a hidden spring. Ugolin wants the land to grow flowers on; Jean has plans for breeding rabbits and growing vegetables. Jean comes with his books and statistics about crops and the weather; he has faith in his knowledge, but believes in God's providence, too. He is a hunchback as well, which only adds to our sympathies. A drought comes and sure enough the lack of water ruins him and the farm is sold to Ugolin. But Jean's little daughter learns of the spring just before they leave, which sets up the action for the sequel: MANON OF THE SPRING.

Like all good folktales, the story here is simple and straightforward, and the telling is always interesting. The characters are all well developed and their motivations are complex enough to keep them human and not types. The movie is a real throwback to pre-New Wave classics such as HARVEST (1937). A comparative fortune was spent in making this movie, but it was money well spent. Definitely worth a watch.",1133395200,4,1244,4.813084112149533
157000,5,0792899229,"Jean de Florette (1986) is the screen adaptation of Part 1 of Marcel Pagnol's superb novel, L'eau des Collines (The Water from the Hills, 1963). It is the story of two competing projects, one carried out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasants Ugolin and Cesar Soubeyran, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s.  Since I assume that by now everyone is familiar with Pagnol's story, let us briefly examine what makes this story so compelling.

A good story must have a plot, a compelling conflict, and characters that we care about who change as a result of their experiences. This particular story qualifies unquestionably as a good one, on all the points.  One of the main reasons for its success is the fact that the viewer is kept in suspense, continuously questioning the outcome of the story.  We can see that a large part of the scriptwriter's role is to ask questions, and then provide the right answers at the right time.  These answers can be partial, ambiguous, even contradictory, in order to reinforce the viewer's suspense and questioning.

The first question posed in Jean de Florette concerns the success of Ugolin and Cesar in their ""carnation project.""  Will they succeed in getting the critical water necessary for the cultivation of these flowers?  This question interests us because these two characters have been introduced as somewhat likable, worthy of our support.  Later on in the film, we have second thoughts about the integrity of Ugolin and Cesar, who now appear to us as violent and deeply unprincipled.  However, the positive, first impression made by the two Soubeyrans still persists within us.

A second question rises with the arrival of Jean Cadoret.  Will his project of raising rabbits, a project directly in conflict with Ugolin's, succeed?  Although we may have considered at first Jean as an intruder who comes and upsets Ugolin's plan, we also realize that the dice are loaded in Ugolin's favor, and our sympathy slowly shifts toward Jean.  But we still keep a somewhat favorable image of Ugolin and Cesar, still hoping for positive answers to the first two questions that are raised.

Pagnol now determines that the progress of the drama toward its conclusion, that is to say the answers to these two questions, will depend on subjective, internal factors, such as the personalities or the stubbornness of the characters, and not on external or providential circumstances.

Thus, the new questions now being posed are about the nature of the characters.  Can Ugolin carry out his duplicitous game to its conclusion?  Will he make a mistake and be discovered, or will he be overcome by a sense of guilt and help Jean by revealing the presence of the spring at ""les Romarins?""  The viewer hopes that in the end Ugolin will give in to his positive instincts.  As for Cesar, the spectator knows that he will never abandon Ugolin's project.  Yet the viewer has detected something peculiar concerning Cesar's reaction when Florette's departure from the village is mentioned.  We therefore suspect that somehow Florette's past relationship with Cesar could bring about a positive change in his behavior.  Independently, Jean's character will also dominate the outcome of the story.  We wonder if his enthusiasm, boundless optimism, and his erudition will somehow contribute to his failure

We are torn between the two conflicting wishes for the success of two conflicting projects.  This is the originality of Jean de Florette and what distinguishes this story from the usual, vulgar Manichaean novels or films.

The themes are the city versus the country, modern versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.

Jean, returning to the country to cultivate the ""othentic,"" is an idealist, more or less in the Jean-Jacques Rousseau tradition.  He has abandoned the city life to return to his country roots.  His knowledge has all been acquired in books.  He speaks in the idiom of the bureaucrat that he was.  He constantly quotes statistics to guide his project and to convince himself and his listeners how Nature should and will behave.  He tackles his project with a definitively modern, scientific approach, having made the proper calculations for his project.  Nothing is left to chance: everything is anticipated and calculated.

To Ugolin, Cesar, and the villagers, because of his language, education, and culture, Jean is a kind of pedantic usurper colliding with the peaceful, traditional aspects of their village life.  They make fun of Jean because his knowledge was acquired in books, not by experience.  Their conversations, Cesar's in particular, are peppered with old, colorful sayings and local proverbs.  The villagers are isolated from Jean's world by their hills and seldom leave their village.  They are attached to the land they have worked for centuries and to their way of life.  The peasants use their traditional methods to cultivate their vines, fields, and fruit trees by hand, without the benefit of any machinery.

In concluding the first part of his story, Pagnol, by presenting us with Jean's failure, seems to distance himself from the intellectual tradition. However, at the same time, he does not consider the country life as a perfect universe, without conflicts.  He illustrates the violence that can result from the peasants' deep attachment to their lands.  Pagnol exposes us to the tribal mentality of the villagers against ""foreigners,"" such as the inhabitants of the nearby village of Crespin.  Finally, Pagnol shows us the deep motivation of Ugolin and Cesar that is also easily understood by a city-dweller: making money.",1128816000,2,5673,5.09967497291441

157012,5,0792899229,"""Jean de Florette"" is a classic French film about the tragic consequences of greed and envy.  Jean (Gerard Depardieu) leaves his job in the city and brings his wife and little daughter, Manon, to live on the farm he has just inherited.  He does not know that there is an excellent spring on his land, but his neighbor Cesar (Yves Montand) and his nephew Ugolin know, and they want it for themselves.  They plug up the spring, planning to force Jean to sell the property (to them).  Jean is an idealist and joyously begins raising rabbits and planting vegetables with the help of his trusty manuals, but there is no rain and the crops will die if something is not done.

The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, allowing plenty of time to get to know loving Jean, unscrupulous Cesar, and simple Ugolin. The pace of village life is slow and the land is hard; the scheme to drive Jean away gradually gets more sinister.  The three lead actors are all excellent and so convincing you'll be mesmerized.  The photography is quite lovely.  The ending may come as a surprise if you don't know that this is part one of two films; the second, ""Manon of the Spring,"" continues the story.

157014,5,0792899229,"Released within a year of each other, ""Jean de Florette"" and ""Manon des Sources"" (aka ""Manon of the Spring"") are often viewed and reviewed separately, but the truth is that they're integral parts of a single story which needs to be seen in sequence for its full impact to be revealed.

Set in the 1920's, both explore the stark realities of the tough existence and myopic intrigue that was an integral part of life in the Luberon's stunningly pretty countryside & villages before the march of time transformed them into ""must see"" tourist destinations. Beautifully filmed and meticulously crafted, their brilliantly effective evocation of the realities of this now lost and very different world elevates each into the category of truly outstanding cinema - visual feasts that re-create what life was really like, good and bad, in what we now see as an ""idyllic"" time.

And, as entertainment? Well, ""Jean de Florette"" wins in terms of having the stronger and most obvious ""plot"", enhanced by Gerard Depardieu's tremendous performance as a man seeking to realise his vision in the face of insurmountable odds. But that is, as ""Manon des Sources"" reveals, only half the story, for beneath the tragedy of ""Jean de Florette"" is a much more tragic sequence of events. Slower, more reflective and, in the end, deeply moving, ""Manon des Sources"" is not simply a ""follow-up"" but the key to understanding the full story on offer.

Individually each ""works"" and, as such, stands in its own right as an excellent film, but it is only when seen together that their true power is revealed. You really do need to see both...",1106784000,4,1609,4.886446886446887
157015,5,0792899229,"The acting--pick any of the three stars, Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil--is superb, and the supporting cast excellent.  But what makes this and its sequel, Manon des Sources (1986), jewels of the French cinema is the story and the characterizations, which go hand in hand.

There is genius in how naturally and almost inevitably the story unfolds.  Although I haven't read the novel by Marcel Pagnol, I'm sure he's the genius.  And this is not to slight Claude Berri's direction which is invisible and at the same time in total control, so that the film is simply a work of art.  The characters are true to themselves, and what they do seems natural because of who they are.  Jean Florette (Depardieu) fails because he puts too much faith in science, knowledge and the good will and fairness of his fellow man.  (He should have listened to his suspicious wife!)  Ugolin (Auteuil), whose selfishness and little guy envy lead him to do the harm that he does, is not a despicable character.  We do not hate him the way Manon understandably does.  He is a man of weakness who gave into greed.  Papet (Montand), believes in the lineage of man, in property, money-all the standard burgher values.  He is led to do his dirty deeds because of who he is.

What is so, so superior in ""Florette"" compared to most movies is the lack of propaganda, the lack of adherence to some political or philosophic preconception.  What shines forth is people living their lives and falling into some very human traps.  I am reminded of Balzac and Guy De Maupassant in the depiction of the petit bourgeois life of the French peasantry and attendant psychology.",1093478400,44,1651,4.743859649122807

 Jean de Florette (Gerard Depardieu) is a city man whose inheritance of a small tract in rural France encourages him to abandon his urban life and become a farmer. Confident that the land holds a spring to quench the parched earth, Jean becomes obsessed with applying his newly learned agricultural skills. Although Jean understands the science of agriculture, he's innocent as to the mindset of farmers such as his neighbors played by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil. His idealistic notion of pastoral life deceives him into thinking that his neighbors are welcoming and honest folk who wish to help him in his pursuits: he couldn't be further from the truth. In the end, Jean becomes the victim of his own credulity and of his neighbor's schemes. Befriending Jean, the neighboring farmers actually want the land for themselves and will do anything to keep it barren.

 This is an extremely good movie with rich detail and metaphor. The acting is top knotch and the cinematography is stunning.  I strongly recommend this film.",1090454400,5,1285,5.0424528301886795

The story is quite simple. Depardieu tries to find a new life in a farm on the hills of a village, whose people don't see him very well due his hauntchback.

Jean Cadoret comes to take on the land he inherits from his late mother Florette, along with his wife (Aimee Cadoret) and daughter (Manon), Jean initiates a utopia of peace and beauty, contemplation and inner state of grace. Little does he knows the faithful tragedy this countryside means, every effort to overcome is a step closer to despair, poor Manon, such an unnecessary faith, the Hunchback is finally aside their mean intentions.
After doing his time in the army, Ugolin comes back to meet his only alive relative, Cesar Soubeyran (Le Papet), with a little red torn plan to become rich, and it is in this moment when Papet sets Ugolin to carry on his will for the sake and perdurability of the Soubeyran strong and respected name, only one obstacle stands in, the necessary land, and most important, an spring overwhelming enough to drank the flowers towards their red adult state, this is Florette's land, now in the hands of his son, the Hunchback, known here as Jean De Florette. And so, Ugolin fakes a friendship with Jean, only to systematically destroy this man's fair dream, Jean Cadoret will die ignoring the existence of the spring that could have turned on his despair into a bliss. Revenge will be at Manon's hands.
Directed by the audacious Claude Berri (his directorial credits includes, A Man and a Woman 1966, and Germinal 1993), the film narrates the perils and sorrows of a man and his determination to confront adversity within hope and emotion, cruelty is the other side of an envy worthy of any cold hearted patriarch, and Papet represents the director's composure of the survival instinct. Rhythm and straight sense conveys the images into a poem of loss, Magnificent. A greening accurate scenery, along with an amazing and light photography, makes justice to every countryside frame, it is both exquisite and delicate, perfectly blended into images, a little shining jewel enhanced by an smooth and classical music score by Jean-Claude Petit (including the overture of Giuseppe Verdi's Opera: La Forza del Destino, or The force of Destiny, 1862).
The film carries on the strong and near perfect performances of its three huge protagonist, the late Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, and Daniel Auteuil. Montand commands all his actor experience and knowledge into a mesmerizing portrait of envy and supremacy, and absolute masterful performance, Depardieu expresses with histrionic sense and candor, all the sweetness and tragic personality of that beautiful character that is Jean De Florette, a brilliant work, and last but not least, Auteuil conveys the slimy ways and contradictory conscience of Ugolin, bringing to screen a versatile view of this man, a much keen and deep superb work. Take into consideration, that these three actors are the best ones of their respective generations, big words to say. The supporting cast also brings artistry and intensiveness to the story. Based on The Water of the Hill, by Marcel Pagnol, the screenplay is one of those very strange occasions when an adaptation is as good as the original text, and the film is the cinematographic equal to the novel.
The Region 1 DVD is good, Widescreen Letterbox Edition 2:35.1, with Dolby Digital 2.0. offers a fine choice, but an improve version can make more justice to this great film.
Jean De Florette is only half of the story, the second part, Manon of the Spring, continues this unforgettable tale of envy and true introspect of greedy behavior. A real lesson for those ones that don't care for nothing more than their own interests.",1068076800,,3891,5.090766823161189

When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.
The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs.",1064102400,2,714,4.257352941176471

157043,5,0792899229,"This is the first half of a two-part movie, the second half being MANON OF THE SPRING.  One of the things I love about this movie is that you don't really realize what it is about until the very end of the second film.  When you reach that point, and all secrets have been revealed, the story that the film tells is seen to be both extraordinarily beautiful and horrifically tragic.
The first film is a story of pure rapacious greed that stoops to subterfuge and cruelty to obtain its desires.  Yves Montand, in the last great achievement in a remarkable career, plays a grower who covets the water on an adjoining property, and with the help of his subservient relative Daniel Auteuil, they plot to frustrate the attempts of the land's new tenant, a middle-class hunchback named Jean de Florette, played by Grard Depardieu, to work the property.  Jean, who is goodhearted, generous, and kind, is a firm believer in scientific principles, and hopes to make a success by applying the most up-to-date methods in his efforts.  Unbeknownst to him, the spring that was to provide him with most of his water is blocked by his neighbors, and his experiment is doomed to failure, with tragic consequences.
The plot of the two films is one of the best I know of in the past several decades, but unfortunately to relate it would be unfair to those who have not seen the film.  I'll content myself with saying that the film contains several major surprises, but surprises that are not there simply for the sake of shocking, but fulfill the potential of the story as a whole, and give the film a rich and deep significance.
Grard Depardieu is extraordinary as the unhappy Jean de Florette, and Yves Montand despicable as Le Papet, the neighbor.  Although throughout most of his career known as a sophisticated, debonair, and charismatic leading man, in this film Montand plays completely against type.  He is thoroughly convincing as a covetous, petty, and vicious rustic.
This film can definitely be seen on its own, apart from MANON OF THE SPRING, but one must remember that doing so will leave many hidden aspects unexplored and resolved.  Together, these two movies represent one of the great cinematic experiences of the past couple of decades.",1054684800,28,2237,4.774611398963731

This one, together with ""The Return of Martin Guerre"", ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and ""Tout les Matins du Monde"" made him what he is today. Unfortunately, he seems to have forgotten.
Granted, it is a foreign movie, a French one at that, but the humanity contained in it, prevails over mountains and oceans.
A story of greed, love, hate, passion, jealousy and everything that comes with life.
A simple and yet complex story, which could easily be transposed anywhere and yet, in its French setting it seems more poetic.
Its beautiful music, adapted from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"", will make you hum it without end.
But, if you are truly interested in the full story, you will also have to buy ""Manon of the Spring"". Without it you may still love this movie, but will never understand its ending.

It's interesting that although she doesn't have very many speaking parts, her body language expresses her character's feelings very well.  I also enjoyed Grard Depardieu's performance as Jean Cadoret.  The viewer really gets a sense of Jean's nave, but optimistic attitude toward farming.

I just wanted to comment on the review that suggested that the film-maker's motivation in splitting the two parts was financial.  Look closely - the sequel takes place some 10 years later and uses the same cast.  The story had to be broken up to allow everyone - especially the child Manon - to age sufficiently to continue.

The conflict is so classic: a good and dangerously naive man (Depardieu) falls prey to a calculating and evil neighbor (Montand), who is helped along the way by a hapless relation (Auteuil). These actors form a trio that is unsurpassed in French cinema and their chemistry is so painfully believable that it is hard to watch the events unfold.
The prolific Depardieu has never been better as the well-intentioned hunchback returning to his inherited land to live a more natural life. Montand, his murderous neighbor who covets the land, is so believably evil as a dried up and selfish man that it is truly chilling. And Auteuil is so weak and pathetic as he participates in Montand's machinations, yet so lonely that he is sympathetic as well.
It is so refreshing to see a film that is so un-Hollywood, so self-consiciously determined to tell a great tragic story rather than some syrupy mishmash.

I loved them as a 17-year old after stumbling across a special broadcast on PBS, and I love them today as a 29-year old recapturing the magic on DVD.
It doesn't get any better than this, folks.  These films are simply bursting at the seams with poignant lessons on humanity.  One which I admire the most is the tax collector-turned farmer's (Gerard Depardieu) single-minded perseverance to realize his dream.  One might argue that he selfishly ignored the well being of his wife and child in pursuing his dream.  But I contend that he would not have chosen this path had he thought for one second that his family did not share the same passion.  In fact, we observe nothing but unwavering love and support from his wife and child.
For you travel lovers out there, is there a better way to immerse yourself in life in a quaint French village without leaving the comfort of your living room?  This is one of the reasons I love well-made foreign films.  They transport you ever so eloquently to another land and time.

It also shows how one person's act of evil can mean no more than the changing of one's shoes, while to the victim it is a challenge of the will to survive, the struggle to believe that there is a reason for everything and all the while maintain a deep faith in God and His acts.  A must!(and to be followed with ""Manon of the Spring"")",990921600,,546,4.44
157069,5,0792899229,"This beautifully filmed and acted masterpiece must be seen with its companion film and conclusion of the story, Manon of the Springs, to be fully appreciated.  Although each film stands on its own, it is the full story that they, combined, tell that makes the experience of the film so profound.  It is a crime that they are not offered together.
The story of greed and deception, of cruel avarice leading to tragic consequences, is further enhanced in the  terrible irony and effect of mistakes and devastating secrets revealed in the second film.  However, this film is complete in telling the first part of the story as we watch a kind and humane man, albeit naive, the Jean of the title (Depardieu) undone by two neighbors (Montand & Autielle) who covet his farmland.  Jean's desperation and anguish as he struggles to keep his dream alive is achingly conveyed by Depardieu in a brilliant performance.
The two films also gave that old master, Yves Montand, one last magnificent role to cap his career.  He is simply wonderful as a shrewd and coldly calculating patriarch, his lazily sly eyes bitterly amused by his manuevers,  setting in motion events that will reverberate and return to him in ways he could not possibly fathom.  It is so rich and full a performance, that spans both films, that you will be surprised by your different emotions about this man.  Montand's work here should not be missed by anyone who loves great acting.  He is ably matched by Daniel Autielle as his torn, sad, and conflicted nephew.
Directed with great care and beautifully filmed in the countryside of southern France, Jean de Florette is a fine film by itself.  But, when seen with Manon of the Springs, the two together make a masterpiece of the consequences of cruelty and greed.

Often some people just hate French movies, because they are so pecked with meaning and philosophy, and they are so lengthy and slow.  Although, I can not say that this movie is too different from the typical european cinema stereotype, Jean de Florette is very moving and powerful movie.  These two movies, together, bring to us the historical picture of the late 19th century, France.  I thought the movie had a great theme: intellectual man, who wants to live like a Roussau's noble savage(man of freedom), move into a small rural, agricultural town.  He tries to use methods developed by scientists and rationalists into farming.  At the same time, the story introduces a native farmer with dark intentions, jean de florette.

As one New York critic put it, you get to watch Depardieu haul water in various containers for most of the movie. So, why see it or buy it?  Because it is necessary to see this film to appreciate the second part of the story MANON OF THE SPRING.
Jean de Florette returns to his home in Provence leaving his life in Paris behind. His wife, an opera singer (who warbles a few convincing notes from time to time) and his young daughter Manon accompany him. Manon is named for the operatic 'Manon' -- but of course.

The style may be slow for some, but the depth of the characters, the realism of the story, and the tragic unfolding of the narrative will undoubtedly inspire more thoughtful viewers.
The film is only the first part of an unfolding story, which concludes in Manon de Sources (Manon of the Spring). As a whole the story is well rounded, true to life and deeply fulfilling.

157114,5,0792899229,"This is the film that got me on to French cinema.  Actually, I made a mistake and watched Manon of the Springs first, but still found de Florette  stunning.  Perhaps the need to rely on subtitles combined with my very,  very poor French forces a better level of attention and use of the mind.  More likely, this work is just so stunning in concept and execution that it  left an indelible impression.  In any event, I was so spellbound by the  Marcel Pagnol story and Claude Berri film that I couldn't rest until a few  weeks later, when I found the novel during a business trip to LA (this was  before Amazon).  Surprisingly, the film made every essential point  contained in the written work, even in the short time available and nothing  crucial was missed.
This film reminds me of someone's quotation about  Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac:  it's not a great play, merely a perfect one.  The performance by Yves Montand, sadly his last, as the elderly patriarch  of a dying out peasant clan was monumental.  Depardieu is excellent, but  that's nothing unusual.  What is unusual is that he still excels in a film  where the other actors are the real focuses of attention.  In every way  this movie is the polar opposite of the standard dreck that comes out of  Hollywood.  If I had the opportunity, I would rate it at 25 stars instead  of 5.

157116,5,0792899229,"this is really a very very touching video, my first time viewing this video lead me to think about the evil side of human being. I have viewed this video several times still with the same impression. why people are so  greedy even in a beautiful village? I have recommended this video to all my  friends and colleagues that love films. Anyone who see this film would have  to view ""Manon of the Spring"" also which ends the story.",960768000,,429,4.405063291139241
157117,5,0792899229,"Just brilliant. Having seen it on video several years ago I wasamazed to see it on DVD now.
Nothing was left out, it was as if youwere there.  Simply amazing. The second half cannot be forgotten about, they are a pair.  Compulsive viewing. For a similar film, see Babettes Feast (French), yet another master piece.  END",955065600,4,319,4.660714285714286
157118,5,0792899229,"Lots of people hate foreign films mostly because they haven'tactually watched one. They think only stuffy, arty, pretentious peoplepretend to enjoy them. JEAN DE FLORETTE and its sequel MANON OF THE SPRING are the films I've shown relatives and friends that have converted them.
Starting the first film, you may think' ""Ugh. Fours of a French movie with subtitles."" Then you get awestruck with the landscape, laughing at the nephew's goofiness, and involved with the intrigues. When it ends, you're going nuts wondering about what's going to happen in the sequel and how soon can you view it. At least that was the reaction of my friends when they saw it.",954892800,9,655,4.90990990990991
157119,5,0792899229,"The common misconception with foreign films is that they are lurid and difficult to relate to. This film delves into the evils that all men possess, and the beauty which exists on the fringe of reality.  This is  truly an international masterpiece, and one that I have amazed friends with  over ten times.  And each time I walk away from watching this series, Manon  Des Sources included, my jaw is left dangling and those others in the room,  especially first-timers, watch desperately as if another scene would follow  to relieve their anguish.  Jean De Florette possesses too much dimension to  be called an action film, and too much suspense to be shrugged off as a  drama.  It is, in all its entirety, a reflection of the human spirit, and a  documentary on what forces bend and break us all.",953856000,11,797,4.654676258992806

While we have no time to watch the 2nd part (the second film, Manon des Sources), I tell them how that one goes and they end up liking this one even more.",1524009600,,299,4.067796610169491
7792650,5,0792899229,"This film, along with the sequel ""Manon of the Spring"" is my favorite movie of all time.  Such a profound example of how we reap what we sow, and the true brotherhood of man.  You must see both films to get the message.

7792654,4,0792899229,"This is the first of a two-movie set. The second film is Manon des Sources (Manon of the Spring). I watched this as part of a French language class (fortunately with subtitles!). The story is of a gentleman that tries to grow flowers and crops in a valley. Others did not want what they perceived as a different-class individual in their midst, and they dammed up the flow of water, effectively putting him out of business and leading to his demise. Film two is his daughter, Manon's response to these less-than-friendly neighbors. The acting is well done, the scenery beautiful, and by the end, the viewer feels vindicated.",1506297600,,624,4.787037037037037
