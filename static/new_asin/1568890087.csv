8592207,5,1568890087,"Although the delivery of the information is poor, this tape is full of very informative facts about herbs in general and about specific herbs. The intro has a great explanation of the concepts behind herbology which is enlightening and provided me with a different and valuable perspective. The author shows how to harvest each herb, and its specific uses. She also covers how to use the herb (tea, tincture, etc...). Even though I have been studying herbs for several years I still learned a lot of new information from this tape but it starts with the basics so a beginner would learn a lot as well. Well worth it !",977529600,10,617,4.618181818181818
