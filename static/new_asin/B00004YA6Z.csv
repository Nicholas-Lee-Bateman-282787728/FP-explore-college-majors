1375554,5,B00004YA6Z,"This is a TV special that aired in 1995. This is a very entertaining documentery on the real lives of the Brady Bunch-when the cameras were not rolling. They were normal kids who liked to have fun. They were very good at goofing off-they were just being themselves.

Robert Reed-who played the father-Mike Brady on the show gave each one of the kids super 8 cameras. They all made home movies with these cameras and now for the first time ever, several of these movies were compiled into this tv special. I find these home movies very fascinating. It shows what these kids were really like when they were not filming.

I think the main thing about this special is that it shows how these kids established a chemistry on the show and why it worked so well. They liked being with each other even off the set. And so when one watches the Brady Bunch, it's easy to see that they had a great chemistry and that's what made them so believable.

My favorite home movies here are those of Mike Lookinland(Bobby)this was one goofy kid when the cameras were not rolling. His home movie of the dogs and cats is very funny. It also shows why he is my favorite Brady kid-he was a real charmer!

So, you want to know what these kiks were really like in real life? Then get this DVD!",1132444800,6,1268,4.360169491525424
1375555,5,B00004YA6Z,"Before reality TV swept the nation, Robert Reed (who played dad Mike Brady) had the genius idea to take ALL of the kids on vacation with him and give them portable cameras to record the event.

Even if it ruinned the serenity of his usually quiet vacations, this same decision would ultimately provide the BEST footage of the 'Bradys' as most people never saw them previously. Thus, unlike a lot of retrospective titles, this entry consistently keeps audience interest.

As chronicled in Growing up Brady: I was a teenage Greg, these movies ultimately provided lot more realistic depiction of the six kids than anything Sherwood Schwartz wanted to produce. Like other teens their age, the 'Brady Bunch''s young actors coupled up and made out with each other There is some really interesting commentary on these films.

Reed might have gained intra-set infamy for his opposition to bubblegum plotlines, but this is easily overshadowed by his genuine concern for all of the kids. Before he died of complications from AIDS, many of the kids honestly considered Reed their second father. The tribute included in this DVD stresses that the sentiment the kids and Reed felt towards each other genuinely was familial.",1104192000,20,1210,5.04
1375556,5,B00004YA6Z,"I loved this DVD. It was funny and touching at times (especially the cast member's tribute to Robert Reed). I had never heard of a ""Super 8 camera"" before, so I enjoyed seeing what it could do and the quality of it was really good. The whole content of this DVD was absolutely wonderful and the stories to go along with it were equally funny and touching.",1097971200,7,355,4.313432835820896
1375557,2,B00004YA6Z,"Eve Plumb seems to be the only former Brady that's made anything of herself that isn't totally focused on the Brady-glory-days. She's an established artist! The 2 stars are for her alone. Seeing her with her art work was worth watching the disk...but not worth owning it.
Oh, Ann B. Davis is really cool too! She's a stage performer now.
If you're a Die-Hard Brady Fan and can't get enough of 'em then this disk is for you. Sure, you'll see some of their home movies...they say ""Never before seen footage..."" But, none of it was a real big suprise to me. I've seen their home movie footage on several TV Tabloids, encluding E True Hollywood. Their playful banter with each other seems VERY scripted and phoney.
Personally, I'd like my Brady Memories to remain with the show that made them all famous to begin with.
Bring their Series episodes to DVD Format. I'd line up to buy those! I'm not kidding!!!!
This was too cheesy.",1019952000,9,924,4.572289156626506
1375558,4,B00004YA6Z,"...all ""Brady"" kids got 8 mm silent movie cameras as gifts. The movies they made with these cameras is what basically makes up this television special. Better and more interesting than most of the Brady specials/documentaries. This special was put together by Susan Olsen (Cindy), which gives it some genuine Brady cred. Cast members are present as well to lend commentary where appropriate. Some footage is from the cruise Robert Reed took the kids on (the trip where Greg tried to put the moves on Marcia, er, rather, Barry tried to put the moves on Maureen). Surprising it didn't air more than once, considering it rated well on it's first and only CBS airing.  This special was filmed after Robert Reed's passing.",999129600,36,717,4.877049180327869

7927319,5,B00004YA6Z,"Brady Bunch Home Movies never would have been were it not for the fact that Robert Reed, who played the father on the hit series, was kind and generous enough to give out 8 mm cameras to everyone in the cast. Therefore, what we get here is roughly an hour of terrific ""home movie"" footage shot by the cast members (especially the child actors) as the series ran its course over several years; and it's great fun to watch this DVD. The pace of the footage flows along against the backdrop of a ""family reunion"" as most of the cast was able to get together much more recently to reminisce about the series. For example, they recall that the original title for the pilot episode was ""The Brady Brood"" instead of ""The Brady Bunch."" The quality of the 8 mm footage is certainly not the best but it's thoroughly entertaining and I enjoyed watching it tremendously.

The footage is truly fascinating; we even get television footage of the actors before the series even began! There's a great clip of Ann B. Davis (who played Alice the homemaker on the series) acting on the Bob Cummings TV show for which she got two Emmys; and we see the majority of the child actors in TV commercials as well. There's also a good amount of footage shot when Robert Reed took the cast--at his own expense--to New York and then to London on the QE2; Reed wanted the children to understand and appreciate the arts and acting and he certainly succeeded. Even though Reed wasn't initially too keen on working with children, he became a father figure to them as they worked together.

As far as extras go, there are the ""interviews with Bobby and Cindy."" These are professionally shot interviews with Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen as they recall the show and their experiences while doing the show. It's a terrific extra feature.

Overall, this is a must-have for fans of The Brady Bunch. Sadly, it is out of print as of the time I am writing this, but maybe that will change in time since the show is very often shown in syndication. Fans of the actors in this series will also want this for their collections.",1267315200,2,2085,4.525198938992043
7927320,4,B00004YA6Z,"I remember when this first aired on television. While I thought that it definitely could have been longer, I also enjoyed it because I was able to see a new side to the Brady's, so to speak. And from someone who grew up with Brady's, at least in re-runs, it was fun to see them as actual kids, being goofy.

If you missed this when it first aired, and are a Brady fan, it's definitely something that is worth watching. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because I feel it could have been longer, and wish that Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb would have been with the rest of the cast during this little mini-reunion. However, as a plus, at the end, there are interviews with Susan Olsen and Mike Lookinland, that stretch to a pretty good portion, which is definitely another plus, as long as you are a Cindy and Bobby fan.",1207785600,,843,4.30188679245283
7927321,4,B00004YA6Z,"Robert Reed gave all the Brady kids Super 8 cameras. Unbeknownst to him, he initiated the concept of REALITY TV! There's no nude scenes, ambush confrontations or interventions, but if you were/are a fan of the Brady Bunch, you will adore this DVD. It is, in reality, a contribution to the documentation of the world of pop culture way-back-when, definitely worth your attention.",1200960000,,378,5.015873015873016
7927322,5,B00004YA6Z,"If you buy the DVD & Play it as I did you'll be displeased as I was for how they took out the very essence(s)of the special once they took out The intro comment by ""Carol"" of ""This is our first reunion since the Girls got Married,"" along with the typed data across the stars'photos saying for one example Florence Henderson a.k.a. Carol Brady & changing it to a still sign saying Florence Henderson's pictures. But other than this with the very essence that it was first seen with on TV with some of their pre & post Brady follow-ups & even if not all them to date at that time on that Wednesday Night in May of 1995 on CBS.so that I want all fans of whom are reading this to write Rhino Home Video,10635 Santa Monica Blvd,Los Angeles CA 90025-4900 but now that I found this P.O.Box was closed the next step to go is to [...] Also in the mean time until the original way of which it was seen on TV gets on DVD I dock this rating from 5 stars to 3",1184976000,,946,4.064171122994653
7927323,3,B00004YA6Z,"Watching the footage filmed by the Brady kids is oddly like watching one of your own family recordings.  Jumping from scene to scene, jerky and out of focus - but there is no doubt the level of love and happiness in eyes of the talent.

Added to this vision is a fascinating reunion with the Bradys (and Alice).  Their respect for Robert Reed (who gave the kids the orginal cameras to film with) is obvious and the long standing friendships between the actors driven out of this wonderful series is great to see (if not something of a relief these days!!).

A most enjoyable DVD for Brady fans.",1170374400,3,594,4.472222222222222
7927324,5,B00004YA6Z,"As I said on another site and as The ""Mother"" starts off this special their saying how This is their first reunion since the girls""Got married.""It's a very good follow up on all the original tv show's members of the original tv show's cast and each just as famous for their real/stage names as they are for their a.k.a. Brady role names including one of Robert Reed but under his birth name saying John Robert Reitz a.k.a. Mike Brady each followed by some but not all of their pre and post Brady roles but still a very good follow up. The cast members each share all of they're favorite memories of Bob including Chris Knight a.k.a. Peter Brady crying & saying how there were a Number of things he would've loved to have shared with Bob but didn't get to of which many times is the case with someone who's no longer with us. There were very good clips of their ""reunions"" too Yes as with The Brady Bunch Variety Hour,A Very Brady Christmas,along with The Bradys. Let's look forward to & clamor for the possibility of further future Brady Bunch Reunions in TV Show continuity perspective of which they still can have further reunions but no more pregnant jokes,the last of which was used in a Very Brady Christmas. There's also a good follow-up on their trips with the Super 8 Cameras of which Bob gave them for on at least one of their trips. Please also do check this special out on the ImBD site.",1137715200,4,1398,4.443579766536965
7927325,2,B00004YA6Z,"I must say I was dissapointed with this movie. What's the deal with the loud pop/rock music that plays totally from start to finish!!???. It's like someone forgot that we were actually meant to hear what was being said!!!.

The film footage was excellent & even better than I expected but don't even attempt to try and drag the 70's into the 90's at all, and especially with that shocking music throughout, it just didn't work at all!!.

Production companies should try and remember that the people who buy these features actually want to go back to ""THAT"" time totally, and that any attempt to ""modernise"" a window in time is a HUGE mistake.

Sorry to sound so critical, but I was really looking forward to a ""total voyage"" back to those 70's ""Brady Days"".

My suggestion, turn off the volume!.",1133308800,10,795,4.617021276595745
