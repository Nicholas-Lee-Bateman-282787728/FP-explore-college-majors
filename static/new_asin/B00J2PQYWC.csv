6316600,5,B00J2PQYWC,"I was in the audience at Unity in Ashland, Oregon when James Twyman announced he was making this movie to honor ""Golden Indigo's"". I kept up with the production in the Ashland newspaper and then I got to see it in the spring at the Ashland Film Festival. Number 1 I love Shirley Knight in it and Tom Skerrit has always been a favorite since the TV show Picket Fences. The scenery of the Redwood Highway is really the Oregon/California Redwood Highway it's lovely and so are the coast scenes. It's a sweet story, an almost possible story, not sure I could walk 80 miles in a few days but the people and relationships are authentic. I got to see the movie a second time in Santa Fe and it seemed better then the first time even. Love the scenes best with Shirley and Tom. As I approach 65 I realize we are never 'old' inside, we are still an ageless spirit full of life and vitality that's what this story is about.",1403913600,2,913,4.283236994219653
6316601,5,B00J2PQYWC,"People do a lot of things for a lot of reasons, but how often do you see someone putting down their pride and doing something for the sake of love?",1403827200,,147,3.933333333333333
6316602,5,B00J2PQYWC,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and I am not even part of the target audience (baby boomer, I am a Generation X person looking for good films).  I highly recommend this movie.  Lets put this way my family even took a trip to the Redwood Highway just to see the areas that are featured in the film.",1403827200,15,323,3.878787878787879
6316603,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Shirley Knight is SUCH a natural in the role of Marie, an older person who has been lately ignored by her family and decides to journey out alone, on foot, on a long journey to find her ""roots."" It's always a pleasure to see veteran actor Tom Skerritt, too, as one of the people she meets, who decides to befriend her.

No spoilers, here, except to let you know that there IS a happy ending! A great film for the entire family.",1403136000,22,427,4.2073170731707314

6316626,5,B00J2PQYWC,Unexpected and quite the movie.  Shirley Knight excelled in this movie about aging and independence.  A bonus was some amazing photography of a beautiful area.,1516147200,,159,5.32

6316629,1,B00J2PQYWC,"What a terrible movie. Poorly developed characters.  Recycled themes, boring journey of unlikeable character that somehow manages to make deep connections with those she meets on her way.  How does this movie have such good reviews?!? XD!!!",1514678400,,240,5.45945945945946
6316630,1,B00J2PQYWC,Waste of 90 minutes. Terrible script. Not believable. Painful to watch,1512777600,,70,5.454545454545454

6316633,3,B00J2PQYWC,"Wouldn't have watched it if I'd known...  The film is focused on actress Shirley Knight, who just does not shine, in my opinion.  What she does is make her costars look great!  I'm not talking 'looks', I'm referring to acting ability.  From the first scene, I got the sense that Knight was trying to project something in a character that I just didn't believe.  Others in the film did a better job of being a believable character.  And I didn't find the ending to be worth the whole film; it wasn't that satisfying.",1508630400,,515,4.483870967741935
6316644,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Being 66 and slowing loosing my youthful aspirations, appearance and health; I was encouraged by this movie to continue to walk with the expectation of good things to come. Thanks to the makers and actors of this movie and all that made this human statement of determination, kindness and love, with a little bit of danger (reality) thrown in.",1507852800,4,343,4.830508474576271
6316645,5,B00J2PQYWC,"This is a truly wonderful movie. In this day of fast and furious action movies, this one really held its own and didn't fall flat. We need so many more slower moving, close to reality movies like this. So many people are mentally and physically sick from the pace of media and politics jerking us all around with fear-fright-highs-destruction. Make more of these. Not sappy ridiculous Lifetime movies, but more of this kind, calm and real with a good story.",1507161600,2,457,4.725

6316647,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Nice movie. I've experienced people wanting to help me when I've been in awkward spots so I know these moments can happen. I've been privileged to see some lovely country but never any of Oregon so this movie is as close as I'll ever be and I'm happy the cinematography was so brilliant. The movie does start a bit slow so be patient, but the pace is nice. Any faster and the self-discovery couldn't have occurred as the journey turns out to be not only geographic but of herself.",1503878400,4,480,4.404494382022472
6316648,1,B00J2PQYWC,"This is the , SLOWEST, STUPIDEST, movie I have ever seen. I have no idea who gave this move a good rating, maybe someone who lives in a box. What a waste of time!!!!!",1497398400,,166,3.911764705882353
6316649,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Well, after a heart attack and reaching the age of sixty five I can definitely relate. Hard headed, stubborn, lack of fear, I can do this type of attitude will keep you going even when you should probably stop.  This movie shows that the elder can learn from the younger and vice-versa.  Life is a circle and we need to remember that as we face the trials and experiences in life.  Well done Marie.",1495152000,3,398,4.351351351351352

6316651,5,B00J2PQYWC,"I really enjoyed this video and Shirley Knight was great in her performance as Ann Marie.  The story is about an older person traveling not only down a physical highway but her walking trip was also a journey into self discovery as well as facing some of her own demons as well as her past.  Tom Skirrit was excellent in his support role.  While I though the other actors portraying her family were a bit stiff and stilted, the people she met were the most real.  I could identify with the main character because her spunk and determination and stubbornness that could get her into trouble reminded me of something my own mom would have done.  I could identify with the family worry but see how the older woman needed to do this walk down Redwood Highway for her own sale.  Excellent video, little profanity, some adult situations and enjoyable!",1492732800,3,845,4.6

6316664,4,B00J2PQYWC,"Heartwarming and captures a valuable intergenerational life lesson very well. Moves slow, but then again the story probably shouldn't move fast because of the subject matter. Not a ""fun"" entertaining film, but not dark either.",1490659200,,226,5.485714285714286

6316669,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Intense. Not exactly cheery, but inspirational nonetheless. At 66 I try to put myself in her shoes and I think, ""No way."" I'd like to be that brave and determined. I guess I am in other ways, but not like this character. Living in Oregon and enjoying the scenery from Grants Pass to Brookings was pleasant.",1486857600,5,306,4.482142857142857
6316670,2,B00J2PQYWC,We found this movie confusing.  From the start we didn't know what the point of her being moved from Bend over the mountains to the retirement home. The home did not seem to be close to anyone in her family. And what kind of opposition to the move and the taking away of her automobile did she make?  What specifically was her anger about?  And what was the objective of the son in doing it to her?  We needed more story information to give this a higher rating. Since the movie had 2 well known actors.................we expected more.,1486857600,,536,4.438775510204081
6316671,2,B00J2PQYWC,"I was really disappointed with this movie, I thought it would be more moving.  To me it was unrealistic for Marie to walk 80 miles alone just to get to her granddaughter's wedding.

6316721,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Lovely scenery.  The story is very relatable with anyone who has had to put a loved one in one of the places like this one.  Even how nice it is, not the same.  Her story motivated me to start planing a trip, in my car, alone across country.",1485388800,,241,3.9791666666666665

6316766,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Shirley Knight-bless her heart IMHO has never gotten  the recognition she deserves as an actress. I believe she was in her late 70's when this fine movie was filmed- and she displays the energy and stamina that would put to shame most folks 1/3 of her age.  This movie is a delight and I recommend it to all. It has the qualities that matter to me in a superior film- that I are hard to find in todays films. First-it is not too long nor too short. Second, it has characters that the viewer will care about. Third it has magnificent scenery, photographed from Shirley Knight's perspective-that is of a walker or hiker- which is a more thoughtful and reflective and meaningful perspective that that of most of us in our chaotic and busy world of work and automobile travel.  Fourth it shows a profound truth about America's ""ordinary people""-workaday folks- that I have heard from many people who have immigrated to America and have lived in several developed and developing countries- that Americans on the whole are overwhelmingly ""GOOD"" people- and this is NOT universally true across the globe. Fifth like the excellent movie ""Suffragettes"" with Helena  Bonham Carter-is shows a subtle sophisticated modern and discerning feminism throughout-in the interactions conversations non verbal communications woman -woman and man-woman that are a joy to watch. Sixth  I think whomever directed this movie did a superb job- as like all good movies-there was zero ""waste"" in this movie-every prop scene word in the movie (like a superior theatre production() moved the plot along or unfolded a nuance of the character that deepened our look into their world-what that means to the character-those they interact with and what it means to us.
  Seventh- there is a discerning optimism and hope about life in this movie. The characters all grow and change in the movie. The conversations of the characters ring true. When it rains in Oregon (there the movie was filmed) you hear the rain gently falling on the soft earth in a rural area and you can almost smell as well as see the freshness of the soft earth.
  Eighth  Tom Skeritt is a good actor- or to me at least a ""re actor""-in a strange way like a more famous and very different personality of a much earlier film era- John Wayne who ""re acted"" to others in the cast with his dialog and remarks. Skeritt and Knight's character's  chemistry  is  palpable and a delight to watch.  Skeritt played a pivotal role in this film as intentionally or not mentoring Knight in a gentle and profound sense in her movement to get in touch with herself and come to terms with what she wants from life at this stage in her life.

that it is a lot farther than 90 miles from Ashland, OR to Brookings, OR. by road. I guess artistic people don't always care about facts.

At least she had her wits about her and grit, too, but it was quite an adventure in its mellow way and felt good to see the ending as it turned out. How strange it is, getting older..., is something many can relate to. This movie is rather slow; some who probably wouldn't like it. But the overall feeling I was left with is the preciousness of nature, may it be saved in these corporate pollution days; and of good people, may they remain as the human angels they are, and the freedom of being alive and following your heart, amidst the odds. .",1481241600,6,691,4.323076923076923

6316831,4,B00J2PQYWC,"This was a feel good movie that was a light and easy way to spend an evening.  The plot is pretty simple, and a lot of it is left up to your imagination of what is going on in her thoughts and what exactly is happening with the visions of 'Thomas,' who I believe was her husband that had passed on many years ago.  The story was uplifting to see all the good people she meets along the way- and it was great the way she dealt the the scary meth head druggie guy that was trying to rob her!  I can see the allure of a long walk to help you think about life, especially since Marie's has changed so much in recent years with her being moved from her hometown to the retirement community (which most of us would happily move into with the pool, breakfast buffet, fireplaces in the rooms, and hot tub!)  Overall, it was a nice movie that was clean and entertaining.  While it would be safe for the whole family, I think the movie is more aimed toward adults, as some of the issues are deep and I am not sure a child would really understand.  The movie also had a lot of beautiful scenery of Oregon, so that's a plus as well.",1480809600,10,1120,4.091324200913242

I enjoyed the themes of an older woman empowering herself, and that life-affirming, soul-fulfilling journeys are never out of reach. I also enjoyed the gentle story-telling of how the paramount individual freewill that each of us needs and seeks can get trampled in the culturally accepted and well-intentioned yet often misguided attempts to be responsible and care for others, especially loved ones.",1479600000,3,549,5.310344827586207

I liked Redwood Highway a lot for several reasons: 1) Marie is a PERSON, not some caricature of an old person,  2) what happens is believable, quite realistic, and  3) it's a revealing character study.  It also has a spiritual/supernatural twist that appealed very much to me.  We're on a quest along with stubborn Marie, a woman who perhaps foolishly refuses to be constrained by age and circumstance.  She meets some interesting people along the way.  And, she learns a thing or two- growth/change is possible, at any age.  Great, satisfying ending.",1479427200,3,762,4.592592592592593

6316899,3,B00J2PQYWC,"Nice character study of a woman newly widowed, newly retired in a retirement community within 4 hours of her son.  I had some problems with it.
First, the son moves her, WITHOUT HER CAR!, to a town closer to him but 4 hours away from him.
Why not put her in the SAME TOWN as he lives if he is going to make sure she doesn't have a car?
She does not have sight or hearing or thinking problems.  It is about her 3 day walk on Redwood Highway to her granddaughter's wedding.  So 4 hours x 65 car miles is 260 miles that theoretically she walks (with a few car rides here and there).  She is in GREAT SHAPE!  She has sweet little adventures with helpful people (and one scary guy) on the road.  She has an issue from her pass that haunts her.  She is a very good camper and walker.
I am approaching retirement so I was interested in seeing movie versions of how people do this.  The son seems to have moved her away from her little town of Bend, Oregon right after her husband dies and now she doesn't have a support system because he is still 4 HOURS AWAY!
But she is so independent, I can't see her agreeing to the move unless she was so done under by her husband's death, but it seems her son would have been more sensitive to that and let her wait to make a decision since it is common knowledge that you shouldn't make any major decisions until at least 6 months after a major death in your life.  So 3 stars but lots of plot problems.  Nice acting, though.",1478217600,,1458,4.120141342756184

Aside from the beautiful scenery, excellent cinematography and Tom Skerrit's performance in a small role, the overall quality of this film is barely above that of a glorified TV-movie-of-the-week, but aimed at cheaply manipulating the emotions of an older audience.  There are many films of this kind that earn the emotions of their audience genuinely and truthfully: Ikiru, Atlantic City, Umberto D., Tokyo Story and A Trip to Bountiful.

The scenery and local landmarks were nicely captured, and that is the main reason I gave it three stars.

6316964,3,B00J2PQYWC,"Although I enjoyed the movie, I didn't find it particularly convincing. Maybe it's because I had to be responsible for my mom when we had to move her 600 miles from her home to an assisted living facility and then be responsible for her welfare for 2.5 years. I also am not a Shirley Knight fan. Anyway, the gist of the movie is people who are caustic and intractable create huge gulfs for their family members to cross and get tired of trying. Then when the family backs away, they feel sorry for themselves. I can see her walking 80 miles just to prove a point that she is still capable and independent, but I can also she that if she got hurt or killed, she wouldn't mind at all if the family felt guilty. I just found the ending implausible because people who live 70 years with such abrasive personalities do not suddenly see the error of their ways and apologize for their harsh comments and behavior and then live happily ever after.",1476576000,,940,4.408045977011494

Bring 'em on!--and Shirley Knight does a fine job of portraying a difficult woman in a culture that puts old folks in a jar on the shelf. Thankfully, the ""cute little old lady"" syndrome is not inhabited by her.  One can see why she is queasy about the granddaughter's choice of mate; but it is also not her business to protest in the way she first attempts.

I guess she was supposed to be gutsy and independent, but I found her selfish.  If I was supposed to see her as a poignant figure, I missed it. It's also highly unlikely she could have walked 12 miles a day.  A young, conditioned hiker could, but it's unlikely an overweight, elderly person could.  The other thing that struck me was her being forced into a retirement community. People can only be forced if they are found incompetent, which she clearly was not.

6317550,3,B00J2PQYWC,"I thought this movie, while interesting in premise and subject material, was not done well enough to be really worth the time. I'm sure the plot is meant to be uplifting as Shirley Knight's character perseveres doggedly in her determined effort to make the trek to her granddaughter's coastal wedding all on her own. The plot is predictable and there is no real reason for the viewer to connect with the woman, unless perhaps admiration for her grit through all her trials and tribulations. Not enough was explained to create real sympathy for her character, because even as she comes to change her mind about judging her granddaughter, her behavior is thoughtless as to the tension she is creating for her family.  As to Tom Skerritt staring in the movie, he really was only in a small portion of the action.  Much more could have been developed with his character's interaction with Knight's.  It's just not a movie I'd want to see again.",1471910400,,940,4.754601226993865

The acting was just OK but, the story line was really weak. The ending on the beach was so unrealistic it just ruined the whole movie for me.

However, as always, my experience with Amazon Prime movies is not what I would refer to as easily accessed.

With all of her faults she grows and succeeds in her journey, proving that as old as she might be, she's not ready for the proverbial pasture.  This  movie is probably not for a younger crowd,  but I believe more ""seasoned"" people will enjoy it.

Given I am fairly close in age to the main character, I could relate to what she was doing. More than that, I could relate as to why she was doing it. So often as we age we are restricted by our families or my our own self doubts by what we will go out and do.

As movies go, it filled the time, but it's not going to make you get up and want to change the world.  Character development lacking... why is she the way she is?  What's the rift all about?

After a terrible argument with her son and granddaughter, over her granddaughter's decision to marry young, the old gal finds herself estranged. She swears that she will take revenge on her daughter by refusing to attend the wedding. She regrets the ultimatum and, in an impulsive move, she loads up a backpack and begins a long walk to the wedding. its a couple days' worth of walking and she is never far from her own first love. Like an odyssey, each experience she has enlightens her, and the viewer. To understand that junction between the fear that one's own experience will be repeated, and the hope that one's granddaughter will enjoy the happiness in an early marriage that her grandmother was denied, that is the internal walk this old woman takes.

The main character has been moved into Mountain Meadows Community (a real place, the real name) in Ashland.  But they show her crossing the Redwood Highway.  Sorry, cant get past it.  Redwood Highway, US199, DOES NOT RUN THROUGH ASHLAND.  Scenery was nice for the 5 minutes I watched it, though.

It also seemed a bit overacted.  I also agree with other reviewers that if she is able bodied enough to walk daily, why would her son be able to move her into a retirement community?  Completely implausible.",1458259200,,774,4.625

Too many unanswered questions about the lead character (the always wonderful Shirley Knight), especially her totally nonsensical refusal to accept a ride from either of the two great people she met along the way. And I'm not even mentioning Tom Skerrit's character who, from their brief contact, truly had an interest in her, but was simply another road to nowhere. It's not that I want every film to wrap everything up with a big red bow; I don't! But I do like to feel that there was a point to be made (sorry, none noted).

I am watching a film (one of my favorite things to do) and Shirley Knight is delightful as a retired red-head in this low budget sleeper that is worth AT LEAST 2 hours of your time. She meets a handsome widower, some oriented hikers, a bartender-nurse as she seeks the fellowship of her granddaughter's wedding. I'm not sure about you, but to me, this is a coming of age flick. I've traveled the Redwood Highway myself in the past few years. So Shirley as Marie walks the Redwood Highway because her son took her car from her. Her legs and per pride are the only things left perhaps, but Marie proves to have formitable legs as she dances into your heart in this favorite movie. The Redwood part of my motivation to move up here to the Pacific NW and this movie highlights some favorite scenes from this area of the US. If you haven't flown into Sacramento, driven to Northern California along the coast to the Redwoods, it's time to go.... Marie moves pillows at stops along the way like she's home, because Marie IS home inside her skin. Marie is not ""nuts"" in my book, son , but I'm thinking about an homage to Knight for giving me permission to be weird in yet another way. REI, here I come.",1449446400,2,1260,4.412017167381975

6318834,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Great movie with a nice message.  Everyone started out trying to engineer everyone else (son tried to manipulate the mother; the mother tried to manipulate her granddaughter); through a series of experiences (and a ""vision""), they came to respect each other for what they were.  I don't think I'll buy the movie, but I did enjoy it.  Once again, it is nice to find a movie that is respectful of the older population.",1446508800,,416,4.671232876712328

Main character takes a 60-mile  hike down the Redwood Highway to attend the wedding of her grand daughter all by herself.  She gets help along the way from strangers and proves her ability to survive, yet still knows she needs help from others.  In the end, she realizes the only way to truly survive is with the assistance of people in her health care facility and her son.

You know that she HAS to be this person. All the supporting cast are true as well and a joy to watch. Tom Skerritt reminds us that men can continue to be hot as hell well into their 70's and beyond.

 This film was a dreadful trough filled with horrid acting, a dry-as-a-bone script, amature filming, an unrealistic story line...the whole shebang. Totally unlikeable characters.  The mother is supposed to be SO old that she can no longer drive or live on her own...but she can walk 40 miles with a backpack and camping gear, set up camp, cook over a fire she made herself, and fend off drug addicts????  AND! in their great search for her, no one noticed an older woman walking 40 miles, alone, on the highway?  Just a ridiculous, horrid film.

Surprisingly, it was better than I expected, with a great supporting cast.  They made it more of a guy's movie and almost got me into a trip down memory lane with my list of paramours and escapades with the ladies one of which could have been this one!  Her character reminded me of one I thought I was in love with, but she got into some heavy drugs like heroin and pretty much ruined any chance we might have had, plus she hung out with a guy I knew and well, that kind of killed the romance for me!  Drugs really took a toll on some very potentially nice and decent people and I belove, that's the main theme behind the scenes in this film!",1442620800,,780,4.18

6318956,3,B00J2PQYWC,"Interesting idea. I like journey stories. But there were a few things missing. One big one was why did she not want to go to the wedding in the first place? What made her change her mind, and why did she want to walk there? Perhaps it was explained and I just didn't get it because I was home sick with a fever while watching this. The acting was good at times, and at other times I felt as if I was watching someone giving it a first try. There is one scene in the woods where she thinks she sees someone, and then has an emotional reaction. I wish the camera angles were tighter and maybe swirled around her with a few extreme close-ups. Because instead we were left with wide and mid-shots of her throwing fits, and we are left to focus on how silly and childish she looks. Her body language in these moments was just strange and forced, in my opinion.",1442361600,,855,4.1878787878787875

What was the ghost of her husband trying to show her?  She yells out to him asking the same question.  Then there's a young family enjoying their time at the edge of a lake.  Who were they?

6319007,3,B00J2PQYWC,"I live in Brookings, OR (approximately 5 miles north of the California/Oregon border on the Pacific coastline), and I watched this movie for the scenery, to see how much of it I would recognize.  There was a lot of scenery I recognized, but since I know the area, I also know that some of the scenes were preposterous.  Like when she drops out of the Redwood Forest (which is in California, by the way), and suddenly she is on North Harris Beach, which is on the north side of Brookings, and 30 miles north of the Redwood Forest and the Redwood Highway, walking south from an area on the beach that has no access but from the direction in which she is going.  The Redwood Highway is known to us locals as ""199"", and it mostly runs through the northern part of California, with just a little bit in Oregon.  We never call it the more romantic name of Redwood Highway, because we all hate it, due to the hairpin curves it is comprised of, and because if we want to head to civilization, we have to take 199 for 2 hours (in a car, not on foot!) to get there.  There are some beautiful places along 199, especially in the few miles there are that go through the Redwoods, but it is mostly just curve after curve after curve.  It was fun to see many places in this movie that I know and live around, but I thought the story line was pretty lame.

The best part was when she fought off the bad guys with ""Bear Away.""  The climax of the film was the dramatic lead-up to a steamy romance between Granny and a young, super-gorgeous woman she met on the road (after Granny bashed her head on a rock while casting a fishing line into the river)...afterwards when she was ambling along the highway, she got picked up by the great looking babe , who then took back to her barThey really got us on that one, because after all the lead up, nothing happened. The romance just fizzled out when the booze wore off. But we should've seen that one coming after the almost triste between Granny and the elderly Burl carver at the beginning of her adventure.

She did manage to make it to her granddaughter's wedding (to a personalty-less drummer).

We were left wondering who had to foot the bill for the massive police Granny Hunt. Those cops sure were determined, but Granny stayed ahead of them all along the way of her back-packing, foot blistering journey. We had wondered if this film might have a hidden and subversive message about police work -- C'mon, a state-wide wo-man hunt eluded them day after day--  even though she was wearing a huge backpack while walking in broad daylight down the only highway to the coast. Hmmmmm. Sounds Fishy. What do you think?  After all was said and done, it's a real heart-warmer not to be missed.",1440201600,,1505,4.5762081784386615

6319049,1,B00J2PQYWC,"I'll be the odd rating since I thought Marie's son and even her granddaughter were selfish. The son sticks his mother, played by Shirley Knight, in a nursing home, probably for some of the same reasons it's done every day. Marie's granddaughter is irritated because her grandmother, who is a bit more experienced and wiser in life than she is, disapproves of her marrying an older man. (A musician who plays drums and he didn't appear very successful). The granddaughter phones her grandmother and tells her she can live without her and she's marrying the guy anyway. I would never have said such a thing to either of my grandparents.
To prove she's capable and still has her facilities and strength, Marie walks 80 miles to the wedding with a lot of diversions along the way. Here you have a son and his daughter who stand there on the beach, all dressed up for the wedding while Marie is still missing. The granddaughter is going to go ahead with the ceremony anyway with high approval from her dad. How's that for selfish when the search should have continued for Marie.

6319052,5,B00J2PQYWC,Wonderful story of an older woman and the people she meets on her journey to her granddaughters wedding.  She has a never give up attitude.,1439164800,,139,4.56

6319054,5,B00J2PQYWC,"I totally enjoyed watching Redwood Highway.  I marvelled at the strength and independence of the main character.  She was stubborn and opinionated and harbored a lot of anger towards her son - mainly for feeling like he gave her no choice or input of where she would live - and towards her earlier self as a young girl, not following her heart to be with her one true love.  When she decided to journey the 80 miles to her Grandaughter's wedding, she packed and planned with good planning and thought.  The anger slowly softened and 'settled' as each mile came and went.  She met some good, honest people as well as a few lowlifes along the way.  All of which seemed to teach her acceptance of how and what her life had become.  I won't spoil it for you as far as how far she went and what ultimately happened - you just need to watch it!  The scenery is beautiful - I'll bet you'll want to ""walk in her shoes"" after you see this!",1439078400,2,930,4.274285714285714

6319079,4,B00J2PQYWC,"This movie is charming and very well done as well as a feel good story.  Shirley Knight is perfect as the displaced senior moved from all her familiar places and friends into an assisted living environment where she didn't want to be.  Her family lived a good distance from her home and moved her to be closer and more able to help her when needed.  Good intentions can be the road to ruin.  When she runs away from the assisted living development the real story begins.
The area where this movie was filmed is some of the most beautiful country in Oregon.  The movie is worth seeing for the scenery alone.  I loved the area and the story was very sweet.  Don't miss this movie if you like a good story with very good people in it.",1437868800,16,731,4.291970802919708

6319264,2,B00J2PQYWC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have travelled and hiked through many of the Redwood Giants forest and must say that is definitely God's Country. Was hoping to see the majestic warriors that protect the skies and was well compensated in many scenes.

My biggest complaint is how horrid this old woman is, was, and perhaps continues to be, but everyone loves her to pieces, even complete strangers! I mean you would not have this kind of luck hiking on a lonely highway for miles if you were mega hot. I am rather confused at how I am supposed to believe that she hasn't hiked all that much in 45 years but eeks out 80 miles in a few days. Good on for her!

The wedding scenes were awesome, the clean, deserted highway a dream, and the independence at that age inspiring. I guess if you truly love your family, go through extreme lengths to care for them, never see anyone make them such a high priority, then I guess you have it coming to you. Hmmmmph!!

High recommend for gorgeous Oregon country and sea side. Campers will cringe at how unprepared this woman is but might reminisce about their joyous moments doing same. Not a good lesson presented here, be selfish, mean, and stubborn and attract the love of the world.",1428969600,,1234,4.495535714285714

It is a great reminder to all those young folks who have that challenge ahead of them. And a lesson to old folks that it's o.k. to let it all hang out once in a while but to use discretion and care in doing it because there is ever present danger in our society that we have to be mindful of.,1412121600,,471,3.9166666666666665

6319294,3,B00J2PQYWC,"I enjoyed this film for the scenery along the Redwood Highway, which seems especially attractive to me, living as I do in a particularly unattractive part of Texas, and for the professional performances delivered by Shirley Knight and Tom Skerritt.  As for the story, I find it unlikely that a woman as vital and independent as Ms Knight would allow herself to be wrenched from her friends and community, moved to another town, and parked in a retirement home.  She obviously doesn't need any help, didn't want to move, and I'm pretty sure wouldn't want to spend the money retirement homes can cost.  I don't blame her for hitting the road, even though her digs look pretty posh compared with many such establishments in my area.",1411257600,,729,4.76984126984127

6319301,4,B00J2PQYWC,"Ann Marie, who says she goes by ""Marie"" (Shirley Knight), decides to take her own ""Sentimental Journey"" on home - carrying memories of her marriage and former life.  A trek of 80 miles on foot to reach Brookings, Oregon to make amends with her granddaughter, Naomi (Zena Grey).  Upon learning of her wedding to a man who is twelve years older than she, Marie just did not agree and felt the marriage would be a huge mistake.  Problem is, Marie does not mince words and is quite perturbed with the situation, although, she has a much bigger issue with her son, Michael (James LeGros).  Needless to say, they have not had a tight relationship, mainly tumult since her husband passed away when Michael was quite young.

He has coerced her to move into a retirement home far from the town she loved so much and speaks of always, Bend Oregon.  He wants her closer to him without having to drive about four hours to visit, which he did prior to moving her.  Marie calls this a straight up nursing home and is not happy, not in the slightest.  I won't mince words here either; Marie hates it and why wouldn't she?  The loss of one's autonomy through your own ability to decide matters is almost a death punch.  I could understand both of their points of view.  Michael gets exasperated with her when she just takes off on her walks away from her 'home' during which she will walk for hours a day - sometimes to the point of people asking, ""Where has Marie gone to now""?

Gary Lundgren directs a very spirited, and tenacious as a Jack Russell Terrier, Marie on a sojourn to see the Oregon coast of her past and to reach a touching destination.  This coastline has seduced her and never ceased in calling to her wanderlust to go back after 45 years.  The tall, and beckoning redwoods and pines that scrape the sky, insist that Marie packs up and leaves after a bitingly spiteful phone call from an afterwards fully remorseful Naomi; a bit too little and a bit too late.  What follows is the highlight of the film itself.

A cantankerous although sensitive Marie is slowly traveling along some of the most magnificent scenery of our own gorgeous country (Fabulous cinematography by Patrick Neary). I loved following each of her footsteps along with her, marveling over how she does it and how she views things in her life.  Marie meets some people along the way, one is a wonderfully friendly and flirty, Pete Peterson (Tom Skerritt).  Who only wants to aid her along in her journey?  You decide.  She sleeps in the woods, makes her own fires, does a little fishing, cooks her own food and vanquishes help as much as she can.  Meeting a particularly sweet and lovely young woman, Stacia (Michelle Lombardo), from an occurrence on the trip allows Marie to finally let her hair down in a full-blown and fun Girls Night and a much needed indoor night of sleep, then up and onward again...

I fully enjoyed this journey on the ""Redwood Highway"" that Marie shares as I felt it was very personal.  The casting of the film is flawless as Shirley Knight does the ultimate portrayal of elder angst and rebellion tempered with a polite sweetness that spills out often.  A film that a family can enjoy together and one you will definitely appreciate if not for the scenery alone.  This is a brilliant trek that proves it is never too late to go back to your own roots.",1408838400,30,3347,4.538333333333333

6319303,5,B00J2PQYWC,"Wonderful movie!  Shirley Knight has you not only seeing but feeling her character's frustration struggling to maintain her independence in a new phase of her life. After losing what was home and life  to her, she is unhappy living in a comfortable ""retirement"" community.  She retaliates,reluctant to attend her grand daughter's wedding.  She rethinks and decides she is going to walk the beautifully scenic Redwood Highway to attend  the wedding after all  even though she isn't invited. Along the way she meets incredible people who participate in the journey as well as her own personal healing. She walks with sheer determination, devotion and spunk finding herself  healing old wounds and new ones along the way. She comes to realize something we all need to remember in our lives., That we are never too old to learn new things about life and about ourselves. Each time I watch it, I find treasures I missed.

6319306,4,B00J2PQYWC,"What vivacious retired woman wants to be placed in a retirement home, even though it seems to be a nice one. Marie, played by Shirley Knight goes out daily for long 4 hour walks. She is quite disturbed that her son talked her into moving to this retirement center from her beloved one in Bend, Oregon. But her son, Michael, played by James Le Gros, wanted her nearer to him. The four hour drive to Bend was too much. It seems Marie and Michael have always had somewhat of a contentious relationship. Marie's husband died early on in their marriage when Michael was small.

Marie's granddaughter is getting married to a man twelve years her senior, and Marie thinks she is making a mistake. Michael wants to drive her to the wedding, but Marie refuses half indignation and half stubbornness. Then she feels regret, and decides to strike out on her own to walk the 80 miles to Brookings, Oregon, on the ice an front. Of note this area has great memories for Marie at the beginning of her marriage. The film is essentially Marie's walk to Brookings, full of highlights and lowlights.

Shirley Knight gives us a bravura performance, a woman at retirement age who can walk 80 mikes is something most women her age would be very happy to do. Walking the last miles so to speak. Liked this film a great deal, and viewing the sights of Oregon from someone who has been there, is a lot of fun. The film has a gritty real feel to it. No fancy, dancy motels or posh meals, the fireside meals of apples, bananas, and muffins taken from the retirement center. A real walk in the woods. A film for the family, recognize your grandmother?

6319309,5,B00J2PQYWC,"A walkabout movie that doesn't dwell in sentimentality. The protagonist, Marie, or Ann Marie Vaughn is a study in frustration --a senior citizen who no one listens to anymore. Moved into a retirement community against her will, the only way Marie can express her independence is by taking long walks everyday. Perhaps the daily journeys off the beaten path through town are a symbol of the restless spirit, not ready to have decisions made for her, even if they're made by family. She's no wimp --forthright and opinionated, Ann Marie is continuously annoyed.  After having a falling out with her granddaughter, Marie decides to walk 80 miles through the lushly forested Oregon Redwood Highway to make amends at granddaughter's wedding. Acted with a light touch, Shirley Knight  owns the role of Marie, and portrays a woman regaining her spirit on this long, and often difficult journey. Tom Skerrit gives a delightful turn as a local burl wood carver who aids her. The simple acts of caring mixed with playful flirtation is so lightly played, and one  hopes that Ann Marie will one day return to the charismatic Pete Peterson.
This isn't a film with drama just for the sake of it. Rather, it follows a character that most people would just as soon forget, instead watching her grow as she rediscovers her spirit within. In all of this, an Oscar nod for Shirley Knight.",1407542400,,1369,4.8418803418803416

I also enjoyed the messages in this film and, of course, the scenery.  Makes me want to move to Coos Bay.  Not to spoil the ending, but I wondered if in fact that wasn't one of her imaginings, as she had during the entire film.

When I began hearing from friends who were lucky enough to still live there and see it in a movie theater, I knew the movie would be worthwhile....and it was more than that.  A sweet sensitive story of determination with a little orneriness that is so typical of my generation.  And Shirley Knight was wonderful at portraying it.  Tom Skerritt was an absolute natural displaying the genuineness of many men who live in the area where I grew up.  I will watch again and share it for memories and for lessons to learn.  No surprise ending, but a touching one just the same.

And yes - if you are going to be a purist - I have heard your complaint:  It is Coos Bay, not Brookings - so what I say!",1404604800,,780,4.258503401360544

The film was so well paced that my interest was held every minute, and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. Most of all I loved the Divine synchronicity of how Marie kept encountering loving, caring folks along the way who provided her with exactly what she most needed along her journey. It is just like that in life--we are never left alone--always along our Soul journey there will be angels in all types of guises looking out for our well being.  Well done James Twyman, cast and creative team.

The main character reminded me of my mother, a little lost with her roll in life now that she's older in age and her children have children of their own.  The protagonist doesn't just want to lay down and wait for death and she doesn't want people telling her how to live.  She's frustrated that people have placed restrictions on what she's capable of. She's got something to prove to others but more importantly to her self.  I think she needs to prove to herself more than anyone else that she can make the walk and I think she comes to terms with accepting help and admitting that she can't handle every situation alone.
