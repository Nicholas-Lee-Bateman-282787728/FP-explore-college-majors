8701981,1,B00TJ57TG0,"terrible movie. porn scenes with unattractive people. plot doesn't make sense, why were those actors pretending to be those people? what was the guy getting out of having sex with the wife? why was the blond ok with posing nude and having released???just dumb. very violent ending trying to make up for stupidity of movie by shocking the audience, did not work. bad bad bad.",1533859200,,374,4.769230769230769
8701982,5,B00TJ57TG0,"I loved this film. it starts off one way and goes dark real quick. From what I can tell this is based on a showtime show which I would love to find but cant seem to find it. are there lapses in the ""reality"" sure. is it a bit too ""sexual"" sure. All I can say is the last act of the film I was standing up and getting close to the tv because the events that transpired in the film were riveting. Its one of those films that after you see it your mouth drops and you feel like you've seen something you want to share with people because it left such an impression on you. A dark Truman show. I absolutely loved this film and I would suggest everyone see this if you even have an interest in reality shows. truly I didn't know where this film was going and when it went where it did it was totally unexpected and horrifying.",1440892800,,821,4.012195121951219
8701983,4,B00TJ57TG0,This movie is insane. Reality television deserves to be satirized and Shooting the Warwicks is happy to oblige. Just wait to see what the tv producer does to this family in the second half of the film. Horrific... but sometimes hilarious. Is that wrong?,1439510400,,253,4.7727272727272725
8701984,5,B00TJ57TG0,"This reminds me of an updated version of NETWORK meets NIGHTCRAWLER.  This is one of the most insanely fun films I've seen in a long, long time.  Brilliant in my opinion.  The sh*t this guy puts this poor family through had me on the edge of my seat.  A must watch!",1438214400,,265,4.137254901960785
