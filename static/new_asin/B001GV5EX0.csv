8307224,3,B001GV5EX0,"The whites live separately from the blacks in South Africa, and once Ben, a white, middle class school teacher with a family, fully understands the horrors of apartheid, he involves himself in the struggle. This is a brutal movie with explicit displays of the torture and murder of blacks of all agesincluding children and the complicit behavior of the whites in supporting the criminal behavior of the authorities. The movie certainly makes its point about apartheid, but its a sluggish story with explosive moments of violence and a few horrifying scenes. Sutherland shows no passion and seriously underplays his part. Sarandon has only a bit part in the film, and Brando returns from retirement to play a courtroom lawyer for a few scenes of the movie. Entertainment value is average.",1494460800,,787,5.061538461538461
