7666254,1,B01BQPZUXE,I had high hopes for this show but it really wasn't very good. Very cliche and rambling story line.,1465516800,,99,4.2631578947368425
7666255,3,B01BQPZUXE,"Vinyl: The Complete First Season,"" created by Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, and Terence Winter, takes place in the music business in 1970s New York City. Richie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale, Boardwalk Empire), president and founder of American Century Records, is trying to save his company, which has suffered from expensive releases and shady business practices. The company is now on the verge of being sold to a German conglomerate. After a tough week of negotiations, Richie treats himself to a cocaine binge, then determines to save his company by planning a leaner future for it. He deals with many musicians  some real, others fictional  and finds himself embroiled in a deadly plot with a radio station owner (Andrew Dice Clay). On the personal front, Richie is dealing with a crumbling marriage.

The series is an often entertaining blend of classic rock, punk, glam, funk, along with original music in these styles. There are characters who devote themselves to hedonistic pleasure and a considerable dose of violence and an organized crime influence, which have always been present in the commercial music milieu. Flashbacks provide insight into how Richie grew up loving blues and jazz and how he got into the pop music business, grooming a serious black musician (Ato Essandoh) into a pop star.

Additional storylines deal with Richies employees, particularly ambitious assistant Jamie (Juno Temple), the go-to gal for whatever drug you want. James Jagger, Mick Jaggers son, plays Kip, the singer who fronts the fictional band Nasty Bitz, modeled on the Sex Pistols. Other actors portray members of Led Zeppelin, Stephen Stills, David Crosby, Alice Cooper, and David Bowie.

Though the series follows the template of many HBO shows by providing multiple storylines with intertwining plot tendrils, it doesnt have the same must see quality as such episodic series as Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and House of Cards. For music fans, it will be a nostalgic look behind the scenes of a big-money entertainment industry in which drugs and excess in general were rampant. Cannavale, who has been excellent in high-profile supporting roles in many movies and TV shows, takes on his first starring role in Vinyl.

Bonus extras on the 4-disc Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette; audio commentaries with Bobby Cannavale, Olivia Wilde, and Terence Winter; and details about specific episodes. A digital HD copy is included.",1465171200,7,2428,5.22879177377892
7666256,5,B01BQPZUXE,"VINYL is EXCELLENT!  NOT A SCRATCH!!!  NO HISS!  Smmmmooooooth sounding!  Great for the eyes and ears!  I watched this on HBO, every episode (there are 10, but 11 hours), every week for 10 weeks.  Goes fast, plus I grew up this music, this time, in this era. 60s-70s-80s were  THE BEST!  And those 3 decades had the best music ever.  I want to buy this on bluray.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE / loved this series!  HBO in past 2 years and more, putting on the best TV. HBO has done it again.

7666295,4,B01BQPZUXE,"I have enjoyed this season 1 of the HBO TV series Vinyl only to find out this is it!
There apparently be no more. As the series progressed it reminded me a lot of Breaking Bad with the drug & criminal activities. I liked the music content but the punk theme was a bit strange considering it it set before the punk movement. Overall it had huge potential but sadly we probably will never find out what happened to the record company and the mob issues that were growing considerably.",1475193600,,482,4.366666666666666

7666297,4,B01BQPZUXE,"Aside from the unneeded mafia stuff, Vinyl was a refreshing look at the groovy 70s music scene.  It easily became the second best HBO show after GOT.  But, in good old HBO fashion, they prematurely cancel it.  Although the characters were left hanging, it is certainly a show worth checking out, especially if you enjoyed Mad Men and Netflix's excellent show, The Get Down.",1472774400,,373,4.796875

7666301,3,B01BQPZUXE,"The shows kind of a mess but has some good moments. Regarding the subplot about the birth of punk in New York, anyone who really cares deeply about it will find it sacrilegious to have an Englishman leading the charge. Especially as the future Ramones stand in the audience taking notes. Kip Jagger (son of producer Mick) fills the aforementioned roll and is really out of his league, sneering his way through the series with a one note performance that finds the middle ground between Richard Hell and Johnny Rotten with none of the wit and humor of either.",1471219200,,558,4.646464646464646

7666303,5,B01BQPZUXE,"I enjoyed the show immensely and was looking forward to the second season. The creators of the show got the era with the cars, offices, the hair and make up of the 70s just right!!  I was excited to get a further glimpse into the era of the 70s record industry and the fictional people in it, but HBO had to cancel the series!! I canceled my HBO....",1470096000,,349,4.132352941176471

product and seller were AAA+++",1469577600,,123,4.391304347826087
7666325,4,B01BQPZUXE,"I am so sorry this series was cancelled.  Perhaps it was too expensive.  I so enjoyed the acting, the settings, the clothes and furnishings and all the interesting characters.  I left the U.S. in late 1971 to live in England and Australia and did not return until 1979 so I missed this period  (1973) in New York and did not really get to appreciate talents like Patti Smith and the Ramones. This helped to fill in the some of the gaps of my generational angst.  I did get to love Bowie because his star was rising in Australia and England at the time. in fact, I remember his Ziggy Stardust ""retirement"" was all over the U.K.  newspapers.

I digress.  I did love Vinyl, I thougth it was such a rich motherlode of material and people and colorful events and clothes and music.  Of course I should have said music first. I enjoyed the Chelsea backstory and Warhol (John Cameron Mitchell was the best Warhol I have ever seen on film, he  presented him as a human being not  a freak) Olivia Wilde was divine, the splendid Bobby Cannavale was robbed of awards and the part of a lifetime, his Richie was unbelievably horrid yet you could see why he was so successful when his savvy and creativity came to the fore.  His relationship with his father was fascinating. The Holocaust backstory with the gorgeous Swedish actress was fascinating and I am sorry I will not get to see how it would have progressed with her daughter, played exquisitely by Juno Temple.  Yes, I am sorry they cancelled Vinyl.  I am going to cancel HBO, so there.  At least we have the Blu Ray, a lovely reminder of what could have been if they gave a show like this, so original, so expensive, so colorful, more of a chance.

7666330,5,B01BQPZUXE,"One of the best shows on tv. Bobby Cannavale nailed it (who would have thought!). Many interesting subtleties like in Mad Men for those who pay attention. It's not The Wire, Deadwood or even FNL, but it's definitely fun to watch.",1466294400,2,229,4.609756097560975
7666331,2,B01BQPZUXE,"Vinyl bordered on bad... an expensive good looking bad, but the story and main character were BS. Not nearly as much fun as it wanted to be, somehow made 70's fashion and hedonism kinda boring, and seems like more of an odd take on alternative reality than historical. The show both worships and laughs at the 70's music scene, all with a simplistic self righteous 2015 viewpoint.

Certainly some of the writers knew their history and music, but they didn't seem to know how to make a show out of it. The writing of the show is clearly looking back with a laughably cliche 21st century viewpoint.  After taking part in a murder, getting really messed up on coke, and implausibly surviving the New York Dolls absurdly literally bringing the roof down,  Bobby Cannavale's record company exec character has an epiphany... ""I know, I'll save my record company with cool non-commercial music instead of the regular crap that sells, because I'm so awesome"". Hey, good luck financially saving your record company with punk, underground dance, and hip hop in the mid 70s, instead of 70's music that actually sold records in 1974. I wonder, if only some record exec in 1974 had been smart enough to release underground music that would have been considered cool 20-40 years later, they would... well probably end up broke, divorced, and in jail just like the Vinyl record exec should have by the end of the first season. But wait, the lead character is real ""rock and roll""... really? Cannavale's character is an annoying selfish jerk that really doesn't help create anything except drama for those around him, but he is supposed to be the heart and soul of rock and roll? This is as much a total fantasy based on an idealized framework of history, just like Boardwalk Empire.",1466208000,3,1767,4.76797385620915

7666333,4,B01BQPZUXE,"Like other HBO and cable shows, VINYL is full of flawed characters, none more so than the lead Richie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale). He is the head of the fictional American Century record company thats struggling financially in 1973 NYC. Hes also addicted to booze and cocaine, cheats on his wife, steals from his business partner, and commits murder in the pilot episode.  Violence, sex and nudity is all here but necessary. The profanity IMO is a little overdone. Im no prude but there are so many f-bombs in each scene its enough to shout Enough already so they could tone down that aspect.

The show is produced by Mick Jagger and Martin Scorcese who are perfect to oversee a show like this because if anyone knows anything about rock-and-roll and film its these two. If youve a fondness for the era, youll definitely enjoy this show and its attention to period detail. Maxs Kansas City is featured as well as a dive bar that will eventually become CBGBs. The casting of the iconic performers who pop up is extraordinary. Being a big fan of Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, I was thrilled to see them in the spotlight. The music performed as part of the scripts is all newly recorded too and surprisingly sounds very close to the originals.

The background music is largely original, with some re-recorded versions and you know they are putting money into this thing when you hear a Beatles original. It takes an episode or two to catch on to the splintered structure as the timeline jumps around a bit and there are these clever short transitional scenes that delve into the characters minds through vintage songs performed by lookalikes in hazy focus. Any Classic Rock fan will be delighted as the performers who pop up include Elvis, Lou Reed, Joplin, Karen Carpenter, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Marley, John Lennon, Robert Plant, David Bowie, Ruth Brown, Jan & Dean, Ted Nugent, Buddy Holly, Conway Twitty and Tony Bennett.

Ray Romano shows his flair for drama as Richies put-upon business partner, and an unrecognizable Andrew Dice Clay shows up in the pilot. The rest of the cast are excellent too with not a weak link in the bunch. I eagerly await Season Two!",1465948800,4,2167,4.7097625329815305
