3668596,3,B001KQS3TI,I like some of the exercise routines but not all.  I haven't used the DVD as much as a result.,1353196800,,94,3.7
3668597,5,B001KQS3TI,"What I really like about this DVD was the way it was both challenging, but at the same time clear and easy to follow.  I was super excited when I realized that Amy Dixon was the teacher I remembered from my gym who used to kick everyone's butts but still be nice about it.  She was an extremely popular instructor and it's clear why - she has easy-to-follow instructions, good tips, and her routines are doable but also very complete.  Even my husband, a marathon runner who never does exercise DVDs, tried this and got a great workout.

All in all, best workout DVD I've ever purchased.",1294531200,2,587,4.457943925233645
3668598,2,B001KQS3TI,We expected a full work out with several targeted work outs.  The targeted workouts are good but the full work out does not have a long or good enough stretching session to warm up your body.  The back ground is lifeless and I would prefer to have individuals showing modifications on some of the exercises,1287014400,,306,4.545454545454546
3668599,4,B001KQS3TI,"These are great workouts. The only issue I had was it was a little hard to tell which used weights and which were strictly cardio. I only do strength training every other day so I need to be careful when planning my workouts. I bought this one and one other from the same company at the same time. I am able to create alternating workouts for each day but sometimes I have to switch discs in the middle.
If someone only wanted to workout for 20 minutes at a time, this disc wold be ideal. For those of us who need a longer workout, some effort is required to pair up the workouts appropriately.
The workouts are good and the trainers are very pleasant. Overall, well worth the money.",1283040000,,683,4.3023255813953485
3668600,4,B001KQS3TI,"How nice to find an inexpensive workout DVD with two of my favorite ExerciseTV trainers: Amy Dixon & Kendall Hogan. This DVD has lots of options that you can mix and match for the type of workout you want. I'm a moderately fit early-40's woman, and I find the workouts to be the right intensity for me -- and of course when you know what you're doing, you can kick up the intensity on days you want to really go for it and take an easier approach on days you're not feeling as sparky. I need variety in my workouts, and I was happy to add this to my library of exercise DVDs.",1271721600,,575,4.097345132743363
3668601,2,B001KQS3TI,"I was really hoping this cardio workout would be higher impact, but it was really easy. I barely got out of breath.  There are different sections and the two that used weights were a little more high impact, but still not challenging enough.  I am underweight, but pretty weak and flabby, so I think this is too easy for beginners even.  I do not see how anybody could really get in shape doing this.",1268956800,3,400,4.378378378378378
3668602,5,B001KQS3TI,"I purchased this DVD because I absolutely love Amy Dixon's Women's Health DVD workouts, but Kendall Hogan's 20 minute Calorie Burning Interval is this winner on this program. Amy's workout on this DVD didn't thrill me (she's not as dynamic and routine isn't nearly as fun).

I love Kendall's workout because it's fun, effective, and quick. I have another workout video with him (Crunch, Total Resculpt) that I don't like at all (him and the students are both pretty phony and goofy), but this workout is genuine, personable and like you have your own great look' in trainer right in your own home!!! He splits the work-out with 1 minute cardio and 3 minute strength training. Also, there is a countdown clock so you know how much time is left in your workout.

For the current price of $6.98 on Amazon this is a good bang-for-your-buck video. You get two 20-minute workouts (Amy's and Kendall) and two 10-minute workouts, plus five 2 minute exercises. That's over an hour workout segment that you can mix and match to make a longer workout or do each one individually (although you have to pick each one for the menu, there is not a matrix system available).

My only disappointment was that exercise tv gives you a store coupon code that you can use on-line for a free workout, but the code did not work when I went to check out. Their live chat wasn't working at the time and I am still waiting for a response back from them.",1263427200,4,1427,4.56640625
3668603,5,B001KQS3TI,"This series is awesome. I own all 4 of the cardio/weights DVDs and they offer a huge variety, but I was mostly surprised with the intensity. I consider myself advanced (Cathe, Amy, Mindy, etc.) and this series really worked me over. But most of all, I felt I broke a plateau and had fun doing it. I highly recommend it.",1253491200,5,319,4.333333333333333
3668604,4,B001KQS3TI,"I ordered a six-pack series of the Exercise Tv Presents Ulitimate Body.  For the price, this series is a great place to start or add to your exercise DVD library.
This particular DVD, Complete Cardio, was one of my two favorites.
Complete Cardio is a compilation of 2- 20 minute programs and 2- 10 minute programs offered on Exercise TV, put together for you. There is also a 10 minute bonus workout.
The first program ""Complete Basic Cardio"" is instructed by Amy Dixon. This 20 minute program is a good place for beginners to start.  The exercises are all well cued and not at all dancy or difficult.  Intermediate or Advanced exercisers will need to ""pump it up"" by doing the moves with extra jumps or weight
The second program is Cardio Burning Intervals. Kendall Hogan is the instructor and one of my favorite instructors in the series.  He is always positive and encouraging. As the title states, this program switches between cardio and strength moves.  The 20 minutes flys by because it feels like you're only doing a move for a short time and then going on to something else.  If you have knee troubles, careful....
lots of lunges, jumps and squats with weights.
 The next program instructed by Jessica Smith focuses on the lower body.  This was a tough workout, but my least fav of the group, only because I like standing leg workouts....a personal choice, so don'e knock the DVD because of this section.  You may like it..
Next is a full Body Cardio Burn led by Teri Ann Krefting.  Although it was a cardio blast, I felt it mostly in the core area.
The bonus workouts are 5 (2) minute exercises focusing on the shoulders, core, lower-body, torso, and a full-body workout.
I had originally rated this 4 1/2 starts, but am bumping it up to 5.  The warm-ups of the segments that follow are easy enough to intensify, so that I was able to keep my heartrate up in between segments, which was my gripe.  (I think I mixed this up with the ""Star Cardio"" DVD that Exercise TV puts out.  This is one of my favorite intense cardio DVDs. I give this DVD 5 stars for the content, adjustable time for workouts, instuction, and intensity.",1245369600,21,2133,4.566929133858268
3668605,5,B001KQS3TI,"When I first got this DVD, I tried all of the workouts, which really was probably asking too much.  Lately, I've been combining one of the 20 minute workouts with a 10 minute workout for 30 minutes of good intensity.  I was very impressed with all of the workouts on this DVD, and I enjoy that you can do 10, 20, 30, or any 10-minute increment up to 70 minutes.  There is enough variety on this DVD to workout 4 days a week and not get bored or too used to any workout.  I am a huge Amy Dixon fan, and I was really impressed with the two contributions she made on this DVD.  Finally, the thing I seemed to like most about this workout was the individual countdown clocks on each one.  I think that you'll enjoy knowing how much time is left in each, which to me was great motivation to give it my all in the last few minutes of a workout.  This is fast becoming one of my new favorites!",1242518400,18,886,4.057471264367816

8315902,5,B001KQS3TI,"Great for when you only have a few min to work out. Easy , but burns calories fast. Also great for combining with other exercises, I combine mine with running.",1370131200,,159,4.333333333333333
8315903,3,B001KQS3TI,"I love love love Amy Dixon!  I was not loving this video.  I work out 4-5 times per week, so I'm not a beginner, but I'm not a hard core work out fiend either.  This video is okay, but I really don't feel challenged by it.  This is the first time I haven't been sold with one of Amy's workouts.",1364860800,,294,3.85

8315905,5,B001KQS3TI,"I really love this workout DVD - especially the workouts with Amy Dixon and Kendell Hogan. I was sad when Exercise TV went off the air, but I'm glad to have found some of their workouts here on Amazon. Like any routine, if you do it often enough, it gets boring, so I alternate these workouts with other DVDs from Exercise TV and Jillian Michaels.

Even though I've gone on to more strenuous routines, I still like these for when I'm not feeling super athletic. I recommend this DVD to anyone who hasn't worked out in a long time (or ever) as they're not intimidating or difficult. All the trainers are pleasant and upbeat.",1361923200,,623,4.464912280701754
