2785880,4,B000NVIGDO,"Lucy the babysitter and Lucy meets John Wayne make this DVD set worth the spare change I paid all worth it alone. This set is filled with funny, classic episodes. I really like this show. I really hope a good company will release a better quality set of this show. It deserves the treatment. I love I LOVE LUCY but this show is just as fun in it's own right. It's a great series and it will make you laugh.

The DVD:
The image quality is not the worst I've seen, but it's not been polished at all, colors are washed out at times, theres some speckling and print damage. The sound quality is kind of low compared to most DVDs. It just hasn't been restored with alot of care. The first disc is defective, and I'm not the only one who's had this problem with this set. The first disc only plays about 2 episodes before stopping and not playing completely. The disc makes a lot of noise in the player 2, but the other discs in the set play fine. Recommended for fans who want to watch some classic Lucy episodes, but I really can't wait for a big studio to release shows like this in a fully restored set, that would be great!",1235865600,4,1122,4.194444444444445
2785881,5,B000NVIGDO,"I'm a huge I Love Lucy fan and after watching a few Lucille ball movies I realized, I'm a huge Lucy fan altogether.  I'm 26 so I did not grow up with Lucy at all (minus the re-runs on Nick at Night). All of these shows are really funny and the bonus disk of Life with Elizabeth were all really funny too.  I never heard of that show until now.  I will actually look forward to ordering some of those shows as well.  It is quite disappointing that they don't sell the entir Lucy Show seasons... I wonder why.  This is the only set I could find with the most shows on it.  I'd love to order the entire seasons.  It's not restored.  It's not HD TV but who cares.  It doesn't matter, HD TV is just something the world doesn't need.  It still plays wonderfully. I recommend this to ANY Lucy fan!!!  Amazing price and as always Excellent service from Amazon!!!",1223251200,6,854,4.209876543209877
2785882,2,B000NVIGDO,"Luckily I picked up the Best of Lucy and Friends for $5 at Walmart in a discount bin. It was the only copy so I grabbed it. The first disc doesn't even play. It got through most of the first episode then it refused to play. I put it in another new DVD player and it did the same thing, which is a shame because I do enjoy this show. Luckily, the other discs play fine, so far. The picture isn't too great but I didn't expect it to be pristine, with the DVD being so cheap. What I really enjoyed was the bonus feature 6 episodes of ""Life With Elizabeth"" with Betty White on Disc 4. I had never seen this show before & enjoyed it very much. This disc played perfectly and I had no problems with it at all. Hopefully, you'll have better luck with your discs than I had.

2785883,3,B000NVIGDO,"My 9 and 16 year old sons (and me and my wife) enjoyed watching these with my mother-in-law.  I got it for her for Christmas because she's a true Lucy fan.  The boys were laughing out loud at some of the scenes.  A good value, though it's a very bare-bones set of DVDs.",1199145600,5,269,4.037735849056604
2785884,5,B000NVIGDO,"This is the best collection of all 30 public domain episodes out there.
The quality and sound are also the best that I've seen with these episodes on dvd.  I would suggest any Lucy Fan purchase this!!  Maybe it will suggest to the Powers that Be, that fans want complete season releases of The Lucy Show.",1185580800,18,304,4.410714285714286

8181957,5,B000NVIGDO,"All 30 public domain episodes are included in this set.  And, they're in chronological order, which is what all the other companies should've done!  The quality is better than most companies, and the full version of ""Lucy Gets Jack Benny's Account"" is here!  Most other companies only have the 21:50 edited print.  There are some edited prints.  I know ""Lucy and the Efficiency Expert"" and ""Viv Visits Lucy"" are two that are.  But, that aside, this is the best set of public domain episodes available!  It also included six episodes of Betty White's first sitcom, ""Life with Elizabeth.""  The quality of those episodes aren't as good, but, it's an older show (1953-55).  Higly recommended!",1451606400,,688,4.964912280701754

8181960,4,B000NVIGDO,"The Lucy Show was great, Great price for 4 DVDs, Love the Betty White bonus too, she's a precious treasure we have on TV now. Two thumbs up very satisfied!",1321488000,,155,4.2
8181961,1,B000NVIGDO,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291593600,,615,4.811320754716981

Throughly enjoyed watching these shows and it will be a great collectors item.",1268352000,,147,4.6923076923076925
8181963,3,B000NVIGDO,"While the quality of the episodes ia great, I am disappointed with the chosen episodes. I was expecting to see a lot more episodes with Vivian Vance but there are only 2. The rest of the episodes revolve around guest stars and really aren't very funny at all. I will wait for the official first season because it seems that there will be many more episodes with Vivian.",1244419200,2,369,4.4411764705882355
