8520664,3,B007PTZV08,"This video is short. Does not shown much different means of fixing some issues. But great thing to do to connect and relieve some of your horse pains. It is hard to tell where a horse may hurt and this video shows you how to check some areas, and how to help them.",1482105600,,264,4.0

8520666,4,B007PTZV08,The information is great. The presentation needs work. She goes to fast and the horse needs a handler. I would of liked to seen more about the hunter's bump solution.,1406160000,,166,4.566666666666666
8520667,4,B007PTZV08,"Overall, uncomplicated delivery, clear and concise. It's easy to use the methods demonstrated in the video. And...it works! (I kind of wish she had gone into more detail, but if someone is a novice, this will be very easy to understand. As someone who has taken the Masterson Method weekend course, has had chiropractic and massage regularly done on my horse, and has had horses for thirty years, I am more advanced in my knowledge, but I found that this complements all of that.) Interestingly, several of the stretches are the same that my horse's chiropractor has shown me, but he didn't explain them as relieving pain points as Lorrie does.

My only reason for not giving it five stars is the quality of the video. While the images are clear, the sound between the menu background music and the actual video varies greatly in volume. The transitions between moving video and stills is abrupt, so the first time through I wasn't sure if it was a video glitch or intentional, but I realized it was intentional. Also, the endings of each segment are abrupt, no segue or transition to indicate that they're done.

There are a couple places with the first horse, Dan, where Lorrie actually seemed to get mixed up on which side of the horse she had found the problems, and she indicates a digestive point that she says she'll get back to but doesn't.

Otherwise, it's a good start to something very simple that anyone can do.",1394236800,,1423,4.661354581673307
