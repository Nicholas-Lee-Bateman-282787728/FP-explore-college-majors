Moreover, the coaching is less than mediocre. I believe I don't need a DVD to teach me how to use a shock collar on a dog. Anyone can use a shock collar, but not anyone can train a dog. I don't understand how this person can be a professional dog trainer. She doesn't seem to show any training, teaching and leading confidence in any of her work.
I would strongly stay away from utilizing her advice.
Bottomline: Save your money. the only professional thing about this DVD is the front cover picture...",1312070400,,734,4.568181818181818
