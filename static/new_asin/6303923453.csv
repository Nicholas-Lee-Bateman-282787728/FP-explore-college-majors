748540,1,6303923453,"Although Eric is great to watch, that is the only reason to buy this video.  As a user of several different video aerobics workouts, I can say this is one of the least legitimate workouts I've ever seen.  They are not actual instructors and the workout is not actually an aerobic workout.  In fact, I bought two of the MTV workout videos thinking they may be a good ""dance"" workout (plus I could watch Eric) and both are disappointments.  The routines are taught by ""kids"" rather than legitimate instructors and it quickly becomes clear why aerobics instruction isn't something any one off the street can do.  There is a correct way to teach aerobics and a correct way to ""call"" the workout so that people can actually follow you.  These MTV videos do none of that.  Bummer.  Looks like some of the moves could be fun, but the instruction is so sloppy and amateurish you will likely never achieve any level of competency where it can be fun.  SO, after all of that, I recommend the Kathy Smith videos.  There is a reason she is the queen of workout videos-she is good!  She knows what she is doing and she instructs VERY well.  You can pick up the routine after one viewing and it just continues to become a better workout the more you use it.  And, if you are like me and the sight of a cute shirtless guy helps motivate you to watch the video (come on, lets be honest here) I actually also recommend the ""Lucky Vanous: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout"" video.  It is actually really great.  Lucky isn't the greatest instructor, but they knew that and brought in a professional to do the actual instruction and Lucky is the window dressing that motivates some of us to continue to watch.  Great routine and I don't get bored of watching it!",989107200,2,1737,4.484076433121019
748541,1,6303923453,This video is not very smooth and you can hardly hear the music. The routine is very erratic. Fat Burning Grooves is an EXCELLENT alternative if you like the MTV Grind Series.,981072000,3,175,4.5
748542,3,6303923453,"I have all of the other Grind workout videos, and this one I have to say is the worst.  The moves from the others are more exciting and innovative.  I felt like I spent an hour warming up and then all of a sudden I was cooling down.  Wasn't there supposed to be some sort of a workout here?  I expected more from an A-List choreographer (Tina Landon).  The moves were far too easy.  I think the best Grind workout overall is Fat-Burning Grooves but the most complicated is Dance Club Aerobics.",975283200,3,493,4.304347826086956
748543,4,6303923453,"This video does provide a great workout.  It has fabuous stretching at the beginning and a cool down at the end with yoga.  During the workout a lot  of time is spent learning the dance moves with the dance being preformed  after you learn each new move and then doing the dance in it's entirety  about 5 times at the end (before you cool down).  I think once I've  mastered these dance steps that it will be boring going over this every  time since the whole video is about learning the dance.  The dancers are  great, it was cool seeing Eric, and Tina does a great job.",966643200,2,571,4.252336448598131
748544,2,6303923453,This tape is alright but it doesn't exactly make you excited to exercise to it. The main instructor doesn't seem to have a lot of enthusiasm. The moves are kind of complicated adn they don't spend enough time explaining  hem.,939340800,2,225,4.625
7857860,2,6303923453,A 10 minute warm up for a 15 minute workout out. What sense does that make?,1515456000,,75,3.75
7857861,5,6303923453,"As I wrote in the original Grind workout review, this was one of my favorite ""workouts"" in the 90s.  I think these videos catered to ""my"" generation.  I was a teen in the 90s and loved R&B and hip-hop.  Back then, I didn't really have workout goals, let alone workout to lose weight or for health matters.  I just liked to do whatever was fun and got me moving.  The Grind videos gave me exactly what I needed, something fun, with great music that I could do with my sister and my friends.

I'm actually kind of stuck in the 90s (music-wise) so I'm a bit biased because I love the feeling I get when I hear 90s hip-hop/r&b.  This video takes me back to a fun time when I actually had the time and desire to follow bands/artists and watch their music videos.  If you're a dancer and grew up in the 90s, then you know what kind of an impact Janet Jackson had on our generation.  I thought this video was so cool back in the day because Janet's choreographer was actually the main instructor (along with Eric, who can't dance if his life depended on it) in this video.

This video is more laid back than the first one, but it's still really cool and fun. If you're totally uninterested in the music and groove of the 90s, you'll probably  want to pass on this one.  But if you're like me, and still request 90s songs at parties and weddings, you'll be kicking yourself for not finding these videos sooner.  This series is ""da bomb"".",1323648000,,1429,4.287313432835821
7857862,1,6303923453,"The whole tape is really boring and dated, and the dance moves are just repetitions of each other.  How can a routine be at all interesting if it's just adding one move to the next and repeating it from the beginning, then in the end doing the same thing over and over????  Very disappointing.",1117065600,,293,4.407407407407407
7857863,5,6303923453,"I love this video I bought all the Grind videos along time ago and I love them all but I think Hip Hop is my favorite.  I have a blast doing these vieos and wish that they would come out on DVD so I can upgrade from VHS to DVD.  I personally find them fun and full of ""exercise can be fun"" attitude.  Check these videos out if you liked the Grind on MTV or if you like dancing as everything is broken down so that you can pick up the moves.",1107820800,,440,3.760869565217391
7857864,2,6303923453,"As others have said, this is a fun workout even if the music/hair/outfits are somewhat dated.  My biggest issue is that the sound quality is pretty awful - you can hardly hear the music behind the vocal instructions!  And working out without music just isn't that much fun.
Try the Hip-Hop Aerobics video instead, it may still be dated but at least the sound balance is right!",1084320000,2,376,4.597014925373134
7857865,3,6303923453,"I had wanted to get this when it first came out back in the days of the Grind.  Today this tape is a little outdated but still fun.  Eric is a little cheesy (yo yo yo!) but I still think he's cute!  Tina Landon is awesome, altho her hair is really scary in this video.  The moves are not too advanced but still fun for more experienced dancers.  The thing I didn't like about this video (which is a common problem in workout videos) is that a lot of times when you're trying to watch what they're doing, they cut to a shot of someone's face for way too long and you miss the moves.  But overall it's a fun tape, it got me moving & burning calories, also there are some basic yoga stretches at the end if you are interested in yoga.",1082592000,,731,4.041666666666667
7857866,5,6303923453,"I absolutely dread exercising, but this tape was over before I realized that I had worked out for 50 minutes (including warm-up and cool down).  This tape is a complete TOTAL BODY Workout.  I recommend this to beginners, it's a really great way to start yourself to a new YOU.  I use it twice daily.",1049760000,,299,4.4
7857867,5,6303923453,"This is a great way to spend 30 minutes working out with fun people, rather mild workout but entertaining, not boring, good motivator... but good luck finding the tape!",1047168000,,168,4.827586206896552
7857868,5,6303923453,"They label it ""light aerobics"" but you definitely work up a sweat, get your heartbeat up all while having fun.  All the Grind dancers participate.  A work out you can actually look forward to.  The dance steps are quite easy to follow and only a couple took me a second or third viewing to get.  Highly recommend if you want a fun exercise tape.  50 minutes including 10 minutes of yoga stretches at the end.",1023840000,,408,4.386666666666667
