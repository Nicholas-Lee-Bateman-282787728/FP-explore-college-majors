8526074,5,B000QFAFR2,"Being a native and current resident of Louisville, Kentucky of course it was big fun seeing something shot entirely in Louisville, and the locations are effectively used to establish both the period setting and the sense of community important to the film, but I think Paper Cut holds up beyond that hometown context, with an interesting story and solid acting. It was particularly pleasing to me that my favorite performance was from Patrick Tovatt, long an important presence in Louisville theater, but I thought the overall quality of the acting was very good.  The three leads were very engaging, most especially Estaban Powell, who is very funny and has the right kind of screen presence to render the offbeat tone of the film. Nora Dunn delivers a nicely observed supporting performance as the hero's mother, with a subtle accent that rings true to a native Kentuckian.

The writer-director, Archie Borders, did a nice job capturing a time, a place and a feeling. Give a small, independent movie a chance and check out Paper Cut.",1182211200,4,1035,4.942528735632184
