As a teacher of young children the tapes present math, problem solving, colors, numbers and a even Spanish and French in an age appropriate manner.

There are tons of illogical things that happen on screen. Why to stacking rings get put on by an invisible hand? (We only see the shadow.)  Why to objects instantly appear. ""It's like magic!"" But it's not magic, and it's not logical.

1689244,5,B000063CEL,"The Brainy Baby series is fabulous and perfect for babies/toddlers because it is slower paced, engaging, and something you can learn from.  My kids didn't like Baby Einstein, which is louder with a faster pace than Brainy Baby, but they loved this.  Brainy Baby is really fascinating as it shows interesting mechanics including balls rolling, toys spinning, babies smiling, bright colors, etc.  There is a lot of ""learning"" as well with letters/numbers/etc.  In retrospect, I think I would have bought the left & right brain dvd's only, the others were good but those were the best.

I am very wary of the negative impacts of TV on babies/toddlers and even older kids (my kids are now 5, 7, & 9), there are a lot of studies showing correlations between TV watching and problems like ADD.  However, sometimes a parent needs a way to get things done (or, when I had my second baby, a lot of the time), and Brainy Baby along with a few other select videos tided me over during those younger years.

I don't know if it will make a kid smarter, but I feel sure a kid won't get ADD watching it thanks to the simplicity and the lovely leisurely pace.  While not everyone's going to love it, kids are all different,I would imagine in some cases a baby/toddler who is used to watching faster paced things might not take to this right away.  It might be a process getting them to engage with this, as opposed to other shows that are flashier to grab a child's attention.",1370563200,,1460,4.541984732824427

1689251,5,B000063CEL,"This is an excellent DVD for 6 Months (or even younger) and older. I bought the Brainy Baby: Left Brain for my 6 months old son, along with a few of the LeapFrog DVDs and the Your Baby Can Read Collection. Within a month, I quit using the LeapFrog products and have been repeatedly using The Brainy Baby: Left Brain DVD. My son is immediately attentive whenever I put the DVD on. I love the separation of Chapters, the mixing up of the subjects and the different subjects; I love the speed of delivery, and I love the breaking of the monotony. My son amazingly watches the DVD entirely, every time I put it on. He is especially transfixed on the Alphabet Chapter, the Counting Chapter and the Shapes Chapter. The instructor's voice is clear, soft and soothing for learning. Excellent learning idea for the little one. I regret not stacking up on the Brainy Baby products before I left the U.S. I am reserving the Your Baby Can Read until later. But I highly recommend starting out with the Brainy Baby: Left Brain.",1318377600,,1014,4.516304347826087

I had observed my baby for the first few days. Apparently, she is more interested in Barney and Sesame street. My wife and I are very happy that we can have time to ourselves.

The funniest thing that never fail to make me laugh is that when we switch to this video, she will watch for less than 2 minutes and start to crawl and struggle for remote control to turn it off. Unbelieveable !!!

Having said that, it really depends as different baby respond to different videos. Perhaps mine like songs, dances, and brightly coloured creatures moving around. She will clap and move excitedly together with Barney. So I will stick to Barney for the moment until she is older.",1317859200,25,750,4.381294964028777

1689259,5,B000063CEL,"I am a working mom so I can't spend as much time as I'd like teaching him myself so I found this to be a great tool to use during the day. I highly recommend the Brainy Baby series and the Left Brain video specifically. As a matter of fact, I have purchased it for two other moms. My son started identifying letters & numbers at about 17-18 months. Now at 20 months, he shouts out letters when we pass signs and counts as we are going up and down stairs.  He requests to see this video EVERY DAY - multiple times a day. I have to say no sometimes because I don't want him to spend too much time in front of the tv. It may not work for everyone but it has truly been a great tool for me.  I will continue to support and recommend Brainy Baby videos.",1253577600,2,748,3.947019867549669
1689260,5,B000063CEL,"I recently bought this DVD, as well as the Laugh and Learn, Peek-a-Boo, and Right Brain DVDs for my 2-month old. These DVDs are part of the 'Infant Learning Pack' which Brainy Baby also provides. My son LOVES them! Any time I put these DVDs on, he gets excited and starts smiling... he sits down, really focused on the videos. Not even his Father or Grandma can distract him when he's watching these videos.

In Left Brain, he seems to like watching the different shapes and colors shown, the ABCs and 123's as they dominate the screen in bold colors, and the pictures of other children playing and learning.  He also seems to respond well to the brief exposure to foreign languages in this video. I love the way that many of the concepts, including ABCs and 123's, are weaved in throughout this series.  I definitely plan on purchasing other Brainy Baby videos.

I sit with my son as he's watching these DVDs #which is highly recommended in the enclosed parent guide#, and repeat some of the concepts with him, and he loves this as well. I also read books to him, which he seems to enjoy.  The one primary benefit I have noticed as a result of these videos is the increased level of focus he seems to have on everything.  Whether he is listening to me read, watching the DVDs, listening to others speak to him, or just playing with his toys, he is very focused and concentrated on what he is doing.

Other great features of these DVDs are the Activities and Games section, as well as the Sneak Peeks, which show sizeable clips of other videos in the series. These are very helpful in deciding which DVDs to purchase next for your child.

All in all, in my humble opinion, the Brainy Baby series is well worth the purchase, or should I say, investment, in your child's education.",1243900800,3,1779,4.503105590062112
1689261,5,B000063CEL,"We the parental units are very familiar with the Baby Einstein series.  Yes we have them ALL.  They rightfully deserve their earned accolades.

But the Brainy Baby series is much better. Brainy Baby approaches teaching in a more direct 'scholastic' manner.  Presenting basic fundamental learning more directly than Einstein.  Having a classroom-like feel about them.  Yet very child friendly.

Solid 45 minute length.
Supplemental 'extra' material.
Adult classical background music.
Interactive mind activating visual presentations which stimulate learning, logic, patterns, sequencing, analysis.
And No puppets!

Together a very impressive collection of videos to get little minds engaged in primary academics.  In today's competetive educational environment these videos shall stimulate your childs brainpower.

Personally we have seen advancement in the young members of dream factory which we attribute to this learning experience.  Directly parent to parent = You shall not be disappointed with Brainy Baby.  Another recommendation is the 'Laureate Learning System'.  But that is straight forward interactve tutoring.",1243123200,3,1122,6.025316455696203

I'm not that crazy about some of the voices in it, but I observe that my son is engaged while watching the DVD and I recognize that he's getting different things out of it at different times. I think this DVD is a must for a child's DVD library and I imagine my son will still enjoy this for another year.

Now that they are toddlers at 22 mos, they've been enjoying Brainy Baby better. They still like Baby Einstein but since that only has music they just get the enjoyment of the pictures and music and such and the visual fun. With Brainy Baby, they are now learning because the narrator will say what's on the screen instead of just seeing it, so they are learning more now and understanding. For us, Baby Einstein is better for the infants, where Brainy Baby is better for the toddlers ages 1+ to start. But we love it!

1689268,5,B000063CEL,"I purchased these used from a bookstore that buys and resells used books and videos.  I think my baby boy was about 5 months old at the time.  These were the ONLY videos that ever captured his attention at that young age.  Any other video--Disney, Baby Einstein, etc.--just had him crying within a few minutes.  These, though, he would watch to the end, fascinated.  To this day, he loves them, and he is now 15 months old; the tapes are WORN OUT so I am reordering them both.  Not only does he still love them, but I just had a new baby, and I am hoping they will entertain her just as much.  In fact, the other night, we accidentally woke him up and he cried and cried and wouldn't go back to sleep.  Finally, in desperation, my husband popped one of these into the VCR, and my son was INSTANTLY quieted the moment he heard the familiar music; in no time at all he was ready to go back to bed.

We have since purchased most of the other titles in the Brainy Baby series--he loves them all, the music, the images of the babies, etc.  The ABC video is especially well-done.  He also gradually learned to enjoy other types of videos by Baby Einstein, Sesame Street, etc.  But these two left & right brain videos are still his very favorites.",1134259200,8,1240,4.297413793103448

1689270,2,B000063CEL,"Sorry, but I have to give this DVD a negative review.

First of all: what age is it really for?  There are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition. Don't you think it's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old (and probably even 3)?  The DVD needs much more real life objects, it sounds and looks VERY dull and boring. I always thought  that children learn through play, songs, rhymes, and etc, but  not through dull repetition. Even alphabet is introduced without well known ""ABC song"".  I am giving this DVD two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son (so far we saw it ones). As much more age appropriate material I would recommend:

Hap Palmer ""Baby songs: ABC,123, colors & shapes"";

Bee Smart Baby- Vocabulary Builder;

Baby Babble - speech enhancing video;

Baby Einstein- Van Gogh (world of colors);

The Wiggles-""Toot-Toot""",1115856000,30,903,4.7243589743589745
1689271,5,B000063CEL,"This is the review that almost wasn't. We bought this DVD months ago, and our daughter cried within moments of it coming on. She was very much a Baby Einstein kid. Recently, she actually asked for this DVD (luckily we hadn't given it away yet). She's 25 months and speech delayed. She usually sits quietly when a show is on. After watching this a couple of times, she was repeating sounds and actually tried to recite the alphabet. The repetitive nature of the DVD series seems to be the key, here. We've since acquired Right Brain, English and ABCs, all of which she loves and responds to. I can't wait to get more.",1112140800,8,616,4.460176991150442

Our daughter is either busy trying to find the flash card that goes with what is being shown on the screen or she is twirling to the music. Either way she is learning and that is the whole reason we bought these in the first place.

I tried the Baby Einstein videos and Baby Mozart held his interest for a bit, but nothing like the Brainy Baby series.  I've noticed that at first he loved the Right Brain the most but as he gets older he is becoming more and more interested in the Left Brain Video.

(Not to mention that Brainy Baby is 50% longer than Einstein for the same price). Brainy Baby has not only taught our 17 month old daughter the ENTIRE alphabet, but it has been a lifesaver for my sanity too! I can't imagine any home without Brainy Baby.

My 3-year old, Sam, can read and spell hundreds of words, identify (and spell) shapes and colors and loves listening to classical music.

1689280,2,B000063CEL,"The production quality is good and I do appreciate that the music is played by an orchestra and not a lone synthesizer but overall I can not reccomend these videos as development tools for infants.
There are many concepts introduced but few are repeated and most are introduced quickly and dissapear quickly. There is also little continuity between concepts. It doesn't seem to me that these videos are based on any research on how infants learn from television but, even so, the videos sure do make rather bold educational claims.  I am sorry to say that these videos are not ""a breakthrough in infant development"" as they say, but yet another spin-off of the toys-moving-to-music format.
Some of the moving toys attracted my infants attention but I don't agree that these videos are learning tools. Maybe for a toddler but not an infant. For many infants these videos will be nothing but a fancy mobile - and there's nothing wrong with that.",1037232000,36,943,4.820987654320987

7958970,5,B000063CEL,"I bought this for my 5 month old boy.  He loves it and is glued to the tv, usually from start to finish.  My 2 year old gets so excited when she hears it coming on and also usually sits through the whole thing.  She and my 4 year old shout out the alphabet or answers to ""what kind of animal is this?"" along with the video.  It is set to a lot of classical background music which I like.",1445817600,,387,3.8
