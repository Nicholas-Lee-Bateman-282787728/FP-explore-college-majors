4511346,5,B00501IDR6,"I love this collection.  The making of the movies is Lord Basil Epping, a character played by Leon Errol. It is slapstick comedy at its best!",1423008000,,141,4.423076923076923
4511347,5,B00501IDR6,"Lupe Velez, the girl from Mexico plays Carmelita Fuentes and later as Carmelita Lindsay. Producer Robert Sisk Brought Lupe Velez back to the movies after 18 months of absence. She is cast as a fiery Latin entertainer who turns Manhattan topsy-turvy with her madcap activities; at best she is the Latin version of Lucille Ball. Donald Wood as bewildered ad-man becomes weak to the romantic onslaught of the Mexican Spitfire, and strongly supported by Leon Errol as uncle Lindsay/Lord Epping. Girl from Mexico became the pilot of the RKO's Mexican Spitfire series.

The Mexican Spitfire film is about Linda Hays as the former fiance of Donald Wood and Elisabeth Risdon as her aunt to break up the marriage of Woods with Carmelita. Leon Errol plays the dual role of uncle of Donald Wood attempts to straighten the martial problems of the newlyweds and also as Lord Epping, the whiskey baron who is the client of Donald Wood acts in antagonistic fashion towards Linda Hays and his wife Elisabeth Risdon. RKO made a loss of $4,000 at a cost of $102,000 in 1939 in making this film, but it was hit in other ways and the studio went on to make several Spitfire movies that included; Mexican Spitfire out West, Mexican Spitfire's baby, Mexican Spitfire at sea, Mexican Spitfire sees a ghost, Mexican Spitfire's elephant, and Mexican Spitfire's blessed event.

This DVD set is an absolutely a great purchase and I am sure you will like Lupe Velez and her madcap acts. If you like Lucille Ball, you will like Lupe Velez.",1416355200,,1510,4.781609195402299

4511349,5,B00501IDR6,"I've been watching reruns of the Mexican Spitfire movie series on late night TV, and, have occasionally looked for them on DVD, to no avail, until now. Lupe Velez was gorgeous, and very talented, and had a natural rapport with Leon Errol, another natural comedic actor. I think these movies stand the test of time, Sure, they've been copied from old black and white film, so may appear to be of lesser quality to those who have been spoilt by CGI effects, etc, but I enjoyed every minute. Black and white film fans will love this collection.",1403395200,,541,4.587628865979381
4511350,5,B00501IDR6,This is great comedy. CLASSIC in fact.  Hair trigger timing and not a wasted minute in the whole series of films. Leon Errol is THEE most underrated comic actor of all time.  Just about forgotten now he was popular in the 30's and 40's and if you watch these films you'll laugh your head off.  Highly recommended.,1403049600,2,313,4.456140350877193

4511352,5,B00501IDR6,"I discovered these old classic movies through T.C.M. & couldn't stop laughing!!!! I was very pleased to see that Amazon.com has taken the time to gather all the movies in the series into one easy to collect box set! If you grew up watching & laughing at the antics of ""Lucille Ball & Desi Arnes"" in ""I Love Lucy"" you will undoubtedly enjoy these great classic comedies! Its easy to see where the idea for the ""I Love Lucy"" show came from when you watch ""The Mexican Spitfire series""!  The number one review of this series says it all, which makes it difficult to write a review. But facts are facts & when you are watching a comedy alone & catch yourself laughing out loud ...to the point of tears I might add, then you can rest assured its a good comedy!!!! Now out of eight films each individual will find their own personal favorite, for me it is the fourth installment ""The Mexican Spitfire at Sea"". The scene were a woman is trying to read her play & for reasons unknown to her everyone is yelling in her face & making hilarious faces at her makes me belly laugh every time I see it!!! I am sure new generations of fans will fall in love with Lupe Velez & Leon Errol for as long as these classic films stay in circulation. And thank you Amazon.com for compiling these great comedy's together, making them easy to collect & introduce to my kids! Lupe Velez & Leon Errol are a comedy team as powerful as any I can think of!",1398902400,6,1426,4.301115241635688
4511353,5,B00501IDR6,"The person who received the Mexican Spitfire film series DVD set was very pleased with it, and I received his thanks for the gift.",1387324800,,130,4.458333333333333
4511354,5,B00501IDR6,"Its easy to judge comedies.
You don't need critical faculties.
You laugh or you don't.
Laughter is contagious.
Its easy to laugh when other people are laughing.
People usually don't laugh out loud when they're all alone.
I watched ""Mexican Spitfire Out West"" (1940) on Turner Classic Movies all by myself one night.
I laughed myself silly.
I re-watched it several times over the following month.
Still laughed myself silly, even though I knew what was coming.

The first half-hour is nothing special - basically just a set-up for the last 40 minutes, when everybody heads to Reno (Divorce Capital of the U.S.A.)

I liked it so much I ordered the complete eight film series (1939-43) on 4 DVDs from Amazon.
The other seven films were good, but not up to the level of ""Mexican Spitfire Out West"".

The Mexican Spitfire series is a virtual prequel to I Love Lucy, with Lupe Velez a remarkable combination of both Lucy and Ricky.
I now have a major crush on a woman who committed suicide in 1944.
Can't help it.

In the first film, ""The Girl from Mexico"", Carmelita meets her future husband Dennis (stuffy),
his Uncle Matt (nice), and Aunt Della (nasty).
The second film, ""Mexican Spitfire"", introduces Lord Epping (very British), played by Leon Errol, who also played Uncle Matt.
Lady Epping arrives with film three, ""Mexican Spitfire Out West"".

Films 2 through 8 have the same plot:
Carmelita notices the strong resemblance of Uncle Matt to Lord Epping.
She devises a wacky plan to have Uncle Matt impersonate Lord Epping.
The real Lord Epping shows up unexpectedly, followed by Lady Epping.

Not very promising, but it works to perfection in the third film, ""Mexican Spitfire Out West"".
Its a bedroom farce with Carmelita threatening to divorce Dennis and run off to England with Lord Epping (Uncle Matt in disguise).
The real Lord Epping arrives unexpectedly, followed by Lady Epping.
A comedy of mistaken identity.
Maybe the funniest movie ever made.
I can't help it; I couldn't stop laughing.

Had she lived this would have made a very funny TV series - a kid of reversal of I LOVE LUCY - a Spanish wife and American husband.  Leon Errol is top notch and works so well with Lupe.  Really enjoy these series - would also like to see JOE PALOOKA, THE WHISTLER, BOSTON BLACKIE, JUNGLE JIM, ELLERY QUEEN and others.  I know some of these like Jungle Jim and Boston Blackie are out as single features at $19.95 EACH TITLE - - but please we are fans - not suckers - or millionaires....",1451865600,2,531,4.176470588235294
