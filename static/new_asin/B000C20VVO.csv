8095290,5,B000C20VVO,My son who has autism and is non-verbal loves this DVD! Thanks!,1408406400,,63,4.333333333333333
8095291,5,B000C20VVO,"We love the Wubbulous World series.  The characters are Dr. Seuss wacky, and many are well known from the stories (such as Horton, the Cat in the Hat, Sam I Am).  Each video has several vignettes, with silly songs and lots of action.  Each vignette has a moral, that is subtle yet worthwhile.  The videos appeal to parents due to the clean language and subject matter.  They appeal to boys and girls ages 3-8 due to funny puppets, voices, and situations.",1276992000,,454,4.555555555555555
8095292,5,B000C20VVO,My 14 month old daughter loves all the Dr. Seuss/Cat in the Hat movies! I have six of them and they all hold her attention--even better than Sesame Street videos! I can't speak for all children but I definitely recommend purchasing one and I'm sure you child will like it!,1152316800,2,272,4.46
8095293,5,B000C20VVO,We actually have a differnt one but in the same series.  Both my kids (4 and 2) love it.  They originally appeared on Nick I think and were done by the Jim Henson company.  They aren't annoying like other kids shows either.  We are looking to find more to buy.,1134259200,2,260,4.14
