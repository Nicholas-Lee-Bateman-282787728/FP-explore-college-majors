4484629,4,B004VW4V76,"I completely disagree with another reviewer that calls this film ""pro-abortion"".  I never got the sense that the film took any side in the debate, it just showed an average American family dealing with a difficult decision.  I thought the film did a great job of painting a picture of both ""Americas"" that exist today, smaller-town vs. big city.  The performances were very good and believable.  The earlier review also referred to the Josh Hopkins character as the ""good guy"", but I disagree with that as well.  As one of the 2 central characters, you think he's going to change and grow as a person from his time in Lebanon, PA but in the end, I don't think he changes much at all.  I found this film to be thought-provoking, well-acted and beautifully shot.",1309305600,15,760,4.634328358208955

It is such a pleasure to see such fine work from young new film makers. This movie, although gets some similarities to ""Juno"" has some more to give. The Characters take us in an emotional and we get tangled in some of their miscues in their life! Sorry for the lack of better words. All in all it is a wonderful story and the acting by all the characters are truly captivating! And I mean by all of them;the Director/writer did a wonderful job with casting of these characters which can always make or break a film!! He did a super job in that and I look forward to seeing more films by him in the near future!!! NOT A GREAT MOVIE BUT A REAL GOOD FILM",1363651200,,792,4.183006535947713
4484631,1,B004VW4V76,"Where should I start. First of all what a mess. Lead actor needs acting lessons. He is not convincing at all. Its a poorly written script. We have a guy here who has no problem sleeping with a married woman and running away with an 18 year old girl.. No regrets no problems with it. But he is such a weak actor and because of the poor script, he has no depth . I can't see the woman having an affair with him so quick. Oh yeah,she just had an argument with her husband so that makes it ok.  We know nothing about the husband and he might be the greatest guy in the world.  The 17 year old girl, the first time she see's the main character, he is naked. She then has a crush on him because he listens to her. Matter of fact she likes him better then her own dad who has been a single parent raising two kids after the death of his wife. Then when she needs the main character he shoos her aside like she is a piece of dirt on her birthday so she throws birthday cake at him(really good listener huh?) Later when she apologizes for throwing cake at him ,he makes no apology for shooing her away and not listening, matter of fact he says he probably would have enjoyed the cake. Yet she still has a crush on him. The premise here is he is a stud and that is why he is so wise and special. Matter of fact when we meet the teachers husband he is puny and bald.(of course) In reality the main character  is weak and self serving. When the main character gets beat up he rips off his pro abortion sticker from his car so he doesn't get beat up anymore.  Now that is conviction and strength of character for you!! Then to make things even worse her teacher(after having an affair) drives the now newly 18 yr old to an abortion clinic to have an abortion because she had one when she was her age.  Anybody get it yet. All the main characters are as selfish and self serving as any I've seen. That is except the father who is the only one who really cares about anything. He is hurt and ashamed that his daughter had an abortion against his values(there's a word missing in this script)with a stranger  and the main character knows exactly where they are. Is he psychic? So the teacher loses her job as she should and the characters make it seem like she shouldn't have.  Give me a break,there should probably be a law suit too. There is a scene where the brother is sneaking out of the house after being grounded as he should,for not coming home the night before,where his sister gives him condoms which makes everything all right.(great message there) The daughter goes away to college with the main character leaving the viewers wondering who will pay for this and how can she do this to her dad. Again all self serving decisions with no thought to the consequences.  Anyway this is a very thinly disquised pro abortion movie. The man outside the clinic seems like a madman,the priest appears to be 100 + and the discussion to give the baby up for adoption is so negative its pathetic. Does anyone realize that just before the abortion, she is so upset she smacks her best friend in the face. Maybe it would have been wise to wait a few days till she can make a rational decision and even if its the same decision it shows responsibility. I am all for Independent movies when they are responsible with good scripts and good acting. This one however is neither good nor worth the time to watch it.",1359504000,,3389,4.26791277258567
4484632,3,B004VW4V76,"Will (Josh Hopkins), an account manager for an ad agency in Philadelphia, attends his father's funeral in Lebanon, PA. While he's back in his hometown seventeen year old CJ (Rachel Kitson) tells him something she's hasn't shared with anyone else - she's pregnant.

I'll begin with this: I would have liked the relationship between Will and Vicki (Samantha Mathis) if the circumstances were different.

The film clearly shows the problems that arise when a teenage girl gets pregnant, when a teenage boy makes a baby -how it puts a strain on the young parents-to-be and their parents.

CJ : It didn't seem to me that this teen was struggling to decide if she should or shouldn't have an abortion. What I saw was a pregnant girl who knew what she wanted to do, but needed someone to tell her the choice was okay.

Lebanon, PA deals with the delicate issue of abortion. I thought it was handled quite well, because it wasn't one-sided; however, I didn't like the way Vicki responded to CJ's question. It was like she was telling the girl the decision to make without actually saying the words as if that would free her of any responsibility.

There were things I did not agree with, but this was an okay movie. Also, there wasn't much profanity, the shower scene was tastefully done (not much was revealed), and even the act of violence wasn't all that intense. What I liked most was seeing characters praying `in the name of Jesus' - that doesn't happen a whole lot in films.

4484633,4,B004VW4V76,The plot and characters are engaging and make it an enjoyable movie. It was well done and captures some real life drama and decisions.,1325808000,,134,4.625
4484634,5,B004VW4V76,"Unlike films like Juno, Lebanon PA tackles real life issues as you would expect your friends and neighbors to wrestle with making life changing decisions. Characters deal with mid life crises; young people find themselves faced with adult issues while still living in an adolescent world.  You have the relationship between an adult child and an aging parent. You force viewers to consider aspects of the aftermath of divorce when children are involved. The film unravels smoothly and evenly even though the issues could take many divergent pathways.

4484636,4,B004VW4V76,"LEBANON, PA. is a quiet little conversational film that is a microcosm of the interrelationships of families and the issues that affect us all.  It is this straight forward, no pretenses stance that makes the film work.  The story takes place in the town of Lebanon, Pennsylvania and is portrayed as a place where values are traditional and immutable. But after viewing the film, one wonders if the reference to this very church- oriented place might be the biblical one: Jeremiah 22:23 'O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in travail!'  Just  a passing thought....

A death has occurred at film's beginning: Will (Josh Hopkins, another actor to add to the Hunk list) has driven form his advertising firm in Philadelphia for the funeral of his distant father, a teacher and toy boat maker who left his family when Will was young to live in this picturesque but doggedly small town mentality haven.  He stays with his cousin Andy (Ian Merrill Peakes), a devout Catholic whose wife died giving birth to his second child Chase (Hunter Gallagher). His daughter CJ (Rachel Kitson) is the woman of the house despite the fact that she is only seventeen and in high school.  Will attends the sparse funeral of his father: his mother (Mary Beth Hurt) is conspicuously absent, preferring to remain in Philadelphia because of her longterm resentment of he departed husband.  Will finds the slow motion of Lebanon enticing, makes regular visits to the local bar (Christopher Mann plays the observant bartender) where he meets school teacher Vicki (Samantha Mathis), hits on her, falls for her only to discover she is married.

CJ has a problem: she is pregnant by classmate Pete (Josh Hunt) but has told no one - until she shares her with Will, a man she feels she can trust.  CJ has dreams of attending college in Philadelphia but her current pregnant status threatens that. She is faced with a major decision: keep the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption or terminate the pregnancy to get on with her life.  Will is supportive as is Vicki with out telling CJ what to do but assuring her she has options.  Andy discovers CJ's secret (as does the entire gossipy town) and on religious grounds demands that she have the baby. How CJ comes to a decision is as tough as the decision Vicki must make about her deep feelings, reciprocated, for Will, and Will must decide whether to follow his father's pathway to isolation form the city or maintain his status quo. The interaction of all these characters results in some tough but realistic decisions about those things we all face in life.

Ben Hickernill wrote and directed this film which at times feels like a Hallmark special and at other times like a solid and brave little statement about the cultural divide in America.  Grady Harp, July 11",1309910400,5,2867,4.742454728370221
4484637,3,B004VW4V76,"I'm a native of Lebanon, PA so this movie had a lot to live up to. I was a little put off by the filmmaker's choice to show Lebanon as kind of a country, hick town. We aren't. We are actually a mix of all sorts of people. The older generation probably would see this movie as the way they see Lebanon life. However, not everyone in this town is a religious republican, so I was put off by that. They painted the kids with the same strokes as they painted the parents and I knew that just wasn't correct. I wouldn't be offended seeing a bumper sticker that mentioned pro-choice or going green. I also didn't think Josh Hopkins would stick out like a sore thumb in our town.  Seriously, it's not that tiny. We do have men that look like him. Those things are nit picky because I'm from here, so it did detract from the story for me.

That said, as the story unfolded and I got to see where exactly it was  going, I really started to get into the characters.  The two youngest who played siblings were my favorite relationship in the film.  The film did remind me of Juno in that the young girl is faced with similar choices, but I actually found this one to be a lot more mature about it. This girl knew who she was and knew the right questions to ask herself. You hope she makes the right decision, but I realized in watching this, you hope she makes the right decision for her. It wasn't about pro or anti abortion, it was about what a young girl facing a lifelong decision goes through to reach her final choice. They wrote her character in such a way that you know she will make the choice that will be right for her and she will be comfortable with that choice. Isn't that what matters in the end? What is right for me isn't what's necessarily right for someone else. I thought this movie was great in giving that message.

The side story with the married teacher could have been fleshed out a bit more. I thought the talents of Samatha Mathis were a bit underused. She was a major part of the story in the end, but her character didn't come off as all that important until the last few scenes.

If you liked Juno, I do think you will enjoy this film as it deals in the same issues, but with a greater maturity than Juno. Josh Hopkins was a great lead and I'm hoping the teens will be able to jump start their careers with this movie as both of them were very good.",1309651200,5,2368,4.1798245614035086

4484639,5,B004VW4V76,"I confess up front that I was attracted to this film because it was shot on location in Philadelphia (where I currently live) and Lebanon, PA (where I'm from; well, the nearby town of Richland, actually).

But I was immediately swept up by the characters and the story. Will is a Philadelphia advertising executive who finds out that his father, whom he barely knew, has just died. Coming right on the heels of a breakup with his girlfriend of four years, he suffers a crisis and heads to his father's house in Lebanon, PA to try to sort things out.

Initially, he's captivated by what he sees as a simpler lifestyle in the rural community and begins to get involved in the lives of his father's neighbors, and especially with a married teacher that he meets while playing darts in a local bar.

The story progresses from there, as he gradually learns more about the values and lives of the local folk. The story grabbed me emotionally and never let go, even as I sometimes didn't like some of the decisions the characters made. But they rang true for the most part, and the actors did a great job of bringing them to life.

My one quibble is that for a movie entitled ""Lebanon, PA"" it didn't actually show much of the city; mostly there were shots of the surrounding farmlands. And nobody actually spoke like they do in Lebanon; they didn't even pronounce the name like locals. It should be LEB-nin or LEB-uh-nin, not LEB-a-non (as has been pointed out elsewhere).

Nevertheless, a very good movie. Highly recommended.",1309478400,9,1519,4.631970260223048

8444103,3,B004VW4V76,"This movie attempts to tell a story that is somewhat of a fish out of water story, but one in which the person is out of their element after traveling to their family's hometown. The protagonist is someone who lives in the big city of Philadelphia, PA, and their family's small town is Lebanon,PA. Lebanon is not large, but it is not that small and it is surrounded by suburbs and the northeast corridor. This only matters because the movie makes it seem as though the community is isolated. It is not. You are a half hour from large metro areas. So, to think that it is so backward is wrong. Is it conservative? Yes, it is. But that it not what is in the movie. Consequently, I think the movie should have been set in the western part of the state. That is quibbling. In addition to this gripe, I felt the acting was not great as was the script.

8444108,3,B004VW4V76,"I bought the Blu-Ray version of the movie and I am not sorry.  It reminded me of a Hallmark Channel TV movie without the happy ending.  Some have commented that it is a pro-abortion movie but I didn't take it that way.  As with others who have commented on the movie, I thought it was a real-life story that dealt with an issue that can tear a family apart.  I was less interested in the relationship between Will and CJ, and much more interested in the chemistry between Will and Vicki, CJ's married teacher.  I had just watched Samantha Mathis in ""The American President"" where she played the shy character Janie Basdin.  Her character in this movie was much more fun to watch.

My only complaint with the movie is the name - Lebanon, PA.  Sorry, but I was born and raised in Lebanon, PA, and I attended Drexel University in Philadelphia.  Except for a few establishing shots in Lebanon City, the movie could have been shot most anywhere.  And if you didn't know that most of Drexel's buildings are constructed with orange brick, you wouldn't recognize Drexel either.  I can't for the life of me understand why the creators of this movie chose Lebanon, PA as the title, but I'm sure there's a good reason, and I'm probably nitpicking?

The truth is, it was the title of the movie that attracted me, and if it had been titled ""Brattleboro, VT"" I probably would have passed!",1375660800,,1374,4.540650406504065
