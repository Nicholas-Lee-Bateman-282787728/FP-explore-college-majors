7352569,5,B012IO4TGG,"I arrived with minimal expectations, I left completely impressed by one of the best horror movies of late. If you're familiar with the franchise, then this is a suitable conclusion to a series that had somewhat lost its way over the last few entries. If youve never seen one of these before, then thats likely for the best, as everything is only that much more surprising and shocking.

The most important metric to gauge any horror movie is fear, and in that regard, this film is a complete success. Its scary like few others ever are. The tension may not always build and sustain as skillfully as the earliest films, but it is not lacking either. Following in the familiar blueprint of escalating nights of terror, the film utilizes a rich trove of sly tricks to intimidate and create dread. Certainly the ambushing jump attacks are quite vicious, yet the filmmakers are always restlessly messing with the viewer to create constant confusion and unease. Including odd angles, off-kilter framing, smash cuts, background sounds, or visual distortion, these simple tricks could be called cheap if they weren't so effective in making the viewer a bit more nervous throughout the entire ordeal by its unnatural rhythms. There are many ways the viewers are teased with fear beyond the usual loud whams, ranging from the subtly creepy to the bombastically terrifying.

Yet beyond the scares, this film ambitiously evolves the genre to be a meta-masterpiece. There have been many movies about ghosts, haunted houses and demons, and certainly a slew of found-footage imposters along the way. Yet this 6th film in the series is the appropriate evolution of all of those ideas, synthesized into a scarier and deeper film than usual.

Part of its greatness is its simplicity. If other films strive for depth and substance with hokey back stories and subplots, this film is lean and mean with none of the fat. A cast of beautiful people playing the average family - their gorgeous home and lifestyle are things the viewer both admires and envies - this is all it takes to create the appropriate connection with the characters. Forget all the complicated exposition about how things work or why. The focus is on momentum alone. Theres just enough nods to a Christian mythology too to inject things with an additional level of Exorcist-like intensity. With its yuletide backdrop during the few weeks before Christmas, now is the ideal time to experience this film for maximum immersive intimacy with the movie as something that could happen to your family inside your home, a modern torchbearer in the Poltergeist vein.

Despite a low budget, its pace is strong with ample scares and numerous FX shots. Theres an intelligent beauty to the relatively small amount of time this movie spends wondering whats happening versus just getting into the confrontation with the entity. Again, other films usually waste the majority of runtime with characters investigating what the viewer long knows, and keeping things frustratingly concealed until a big reveal. While prior Paranormals might reserve their money and effects for one climactic Boo!, this movie has over a dozen of those, making this the big-budget entrant to the series. And unlike other films which follow pat rules and rote formula on who is expendable and when, this one still smartly places all characters in harms way, sparing no one from the unstoppable brutality.

The villain is your usual nebulous spirit/entity/ghost/demon/force. But what's unusual is this character's especially ingenious design, where it can be both invisible to the characters yet still given form and shape to the viewer. This novelty alone is worth the price of admission. To see the lurking menace silently stalking everyone is a rare treat, a creature thats not content to always hide from view, yet sometimes gleefully revels in its menacing presence. If one were to reach for philosophical heft, the entity is an evil embodiment of the lurking tensions amongst the family dynamic. But the thing just looks downright cool too. Though borrowing from other designs of past, the monster takes both many forms and none at all, making every encounter something new. Oftentimes, the thing can be completely camouflaged in plain view, giving it the magical power to appear instantly from a spot which the viewer had already been unwittingly staring at. There is one part where the monster goes under a blanket to appear like the traditional white-sheet, cheap-Halloween-costume ghost. In yet another little flash of brilliance, this amazingly simple manifestation has never really appeared on screen before in a serious live-action setting outside of some childrens cartoons.

There is a great sense of mystery still informing this film. Viewers expecting all questions ever to be answered will be disappointed. But while the film builds and explores the mythology (mostly from the third film) in new but limited ways, the general enigma of the plot is commendable for resisting the temptation of easy and dumb answers. There is a Lovecraft-like manner in its creation of indefinable horrors which cannot be easily categorized. So it still plays for newbies to the series just as well.

There are a few flaws to the film, including numerous missed opportunities to take greater advantage of its unique premise, or connect it better to the series as a whole. The acting can be weak, especially from the father where the viewer often cannot tell whether he is scared or amused. And a superficial examination of the film will make it seem like a generic rip-off of an overdone genre. Haters can gleefully nitpick its apparently simple characters and story, especially if they resist immersion by laughing at it in a brightly-lit room surrounded by other mocking friends.

But anybody who actively watches horror films will recognize the sly subversions of genre tropes and its deft employment of filmmaking craft. Just as the meta-narrative involves this new family watching what happened to the old ones, this film takes old and common clichs to new and exciting heights, a triumphant zenith to found-footage ghost stories which the series helped to invent.

7352572,3,B012IO4TGG,"The film opens in Santa Rosa 1988. A cult like family are encouraging their special daughter to talk to an invisible entity named ""Toby."" In 2013 a new family moves into said house and find their camera and VHS tapes. This is a special camera is equipped with ""spirit photography"" capability. Their daughter Leila (Ivy George) starts speaking to ""Toby"" as brothers Mike (Dan Gill) and Ryan (Chris J. Murray) film spirits and watch the old tapes of a young girl who eerily describes what she sees in their time period.

The film attempts to have a few cute moments before it gets serious, but the script wasn't there. The feature is all low budget hand held camera including the green cam, but doesn't give us the dreaded foot cam. The movie isn't too deep and allows the viewer to get caught up with the events. Could have been better without the insistence of using a cheap camera for the entire film.

WHO FILMS THEMSELVES 24 HOURS OF THE DAY & REACT WITH SUCH DUMBNESS TO NOISES THAT ARE NOT EVEN SCARY!!!???? From the beginning of these series of movies my thought was WHAT A STUPID A RIP-OFF of a great original concept that was started by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. That movie was scary because it sold me into the idea that the found footage of the 3 students lost in the woods at the mercy of an unseen evil force was real. Then everybody jumped on the band wagon to try to capitalize on the novelty that has finally worn it's welcome. With the exception of a handful of really frightening movies that used that formula everything else fell into the category of cheaply made, cheaply looking, cheaply acted movies, NOT SCARY JUST PLAIN STUPID!!!! AND FOR MY TASTE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY MOVIES FALL INTO!! Only THE MARKED ONES had a little bit of an interesting story.

They changed the story so that Christie and Heather are schooled to become what they become but then disappear.  Except they didn't disappear in the first one.  They survived a fire.  If you stretch really hard you can make that work.
The end is disappointing but there are some great scares along the way.  The build up is so good, in fact, that the ending might not actually be that bad, but just doesn't live up to the cool story.

7352595,5,B012IO4TGG,"I've now seen all of the PA and I understand this isn't everyone's cup of tea that's fine.

Hell I never thought it would be MY cup of tea but I was pleasantly surprised .

I've enjoyed all of them despite the very predictable endings in each film.

They kinda established what these movies were all about in the first three films after all.

I found the fourth one good also but kinda dull in parts and as I said earlier pretty predictable .

This has been my favorite entry so far especially considering the fact that the mom for a change catches on fairly quick as does the father and his friend that something is off.

It didn't take them anywhere near as long to figure it out as it did all the others in the last four films .

They also made fairly smart decisions to monitoring their child at night to see what happened so they could actually protect their child from whatever it was that was there.

To getting an exorcist to cone to their home and see what he could do to help.

I found the characters more interesting and likeable as well in this entry.

I also loved the colors and all the Christmasy stuff that was going on and I watched this in December mind you.

To each their own some may hate this franchise others may love it I became a fan after watching the sequel in 2014 I taped it on a movie channel to give it a fair shot and wound up really enjoying it.

I've been a fan ever since then .

I also found the other plane more interesting as well as the overall special effects .

It was very cool how they made it look.

I wasn't lucky enough to see this in 3D I saw it in 2D but I sure it must have been nice to watch in theaters .",1465603200,,1655,4.049230769230769

7352609,1,B012IO4TGG,"Note: To those who have not seen this movie yet, there might be a few spoilers within my review, but I assure anyone reading that I am only voicing my discontent with the entire franchise, particularly with the newest installment.

Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension arrived to theaters last year and I ordered my DVD almost immediately after. The first few weeks of watching the movie were somewhat thrilling, but now I'm finding that the more I watch this film, the more difficult it is to sit through in its entirety. Call it an epiphany! Nevertheless, I am utterly disgusted with the premise of this film and as equally disgusted with the writers and director! There was a brief moment in the movie where there appeared to be a glimmer of hope, as the family and a Priest gathered together and actually captured the demon, Toby, with a blanket. But then, as usual, evil prevails and wreaks havoc on all who are present, leaving only the little daughter, Leila, as the sole survivor. I am sure that some, like myself, may find this ongoing theme to be a bit boring, or maybe even downright annoying. I have come to the realization that the murders of the parents and family members are just plain vile!

There is absolutely nothing interesting nor appealing about the typical outline of this movie, and the idea of killing off innocent family members is simply disgusting! Sure I have parts 1-5, and I have been a faithful follower of each film, but I feel that I am now over it. No one ever survives, parents come and go in succession and evil powers through without a care to spareit's sick! If you ask me, I believe that it is time for the writer(s) and director to move on from this franchise and aim for something higher and a little less tasteless. I guess I'm just glad that I have finally seen the light (no pun intended). These films are simply too much evil to even have in my home and I can't continue to support this franchise.

Movie begins in the month of September 1988 in Santa Rosa, California.  In a scene left-off from Paranormal Activity 3  (2011), Dennis (Chris Smith) is trying to get up off the living room floor, but the witch, Grandma Lois (Hallie Foote), controls his body and makes his back bend backwards, crushing his spine. The girls, Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), are sent upstairs to meet The Teacher. He tells them that today is a new beginning and then tells them the future about what will happen in their lives.
  Now the story forwards to Santa Rosa on November 29, 2013, fifteen years later. Uncle Mike (Dan Gill) comes to visit, from Chicago, for a couple weeks to stay with his brother, Ryan (Chris J. Murray) and his family, his wife Emily (Brit Shaw) and daughter, Lelia (Ivy George). Mike is trying to get over a break up of a girlfriend. A woman, Skyler (Olivia Taylor Dudley), a friend of the family, possibly Emily's friend, is also visiting for a week during the holidays.
  While putting up the Christmas decorations outside, an old strange video camera is found in a box from the garage. When Ryan used the camera in the house, he is able to see some ghostly 3D images.

Also in the cast: Don McManus, Michael Krawic, Cara Pifko, Mark Steger.

Option of language: English, French, Spanish. English Audio Description.
Option of subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portugues.

Sorry, to see this is the last film they will make, but I guess they are not making the kind of money from the movie theaters they were hoping for.  This last movie is not very good.

7352628,4,B012IO4TGG,"Though I have enjoyed all the entries in the Paranormal Activity series as standalone movies to some degree (part 5, The Marked Ones, is the only one I might say comes close to bordering on dull) the problem is that the last three or four installments have all ended up in more or less the same spot and have failed to move the arching storyline forward in any significant way. Too long have we been teased with subplots that, though obviously connected, have been recycled endlessly and gone nowhere, and its been frustrating. I honestly almost forgot the latest film, The Ghost Dimension, even existed until I happened to see it on the new release endcap at the store, but in spite of my criticisms my curiosity got the best of me and I picked it up blindly. And you know what? Im glad I did!

I won't rehash the entire plot as many others here have done already, but suffice it to say some secrets are at long last revealed and things finally start to move forward and develop more fully, especially where our demon friend Toby is concerned. Now, granted, the ending is still set up to be sequel bait, as I expected it probably would be, but in spite of that I would say this movie still accomplished more on its own than the three preceding it combined. Im actually kind of surprised at all the negativity it has received; this is definitely the one that has revived my interest in the series and Im looking forward to how they handle whats coming next.

With all that said, I don't want to build it up as the greatest thing ever. The characters are somewhat cookie-cutter and forgettable, and the weird little girl trope has grown rather stale in movies like this, but its all serviceable enough for what they were trying to do here and I have certainly seen worse. I will acknowledge the somewhat misleading title of the movie  we don't actually get to SEE another dimension or where the ghosts and demons reside, exactly, but rather we see the entities themselves appear on video for the first time via a special camera that allows such things to be captured on film. So, same setting, really, but with an extra dose of sometimes-questionable CGI. (Im a clairvoyant and see spirits and energies manifest as abstract shapes all the time, and some of it was a little eye-roll inducing even for me, lol.)

I won't get into the subjective argument of whether these movies are still scary. I will admit they may have since lost the edge so brilliantly captured by the first one, but as they become more and more plot-centric and veer away from the jump scares I still think they succeed just fine at setting a certain unsettling overall tone nevertheless. Also, if you're viewing Ghost Dimension at home on bluray, do be sure to check out the deleted scenes, as most of them are pretty good and probably should have made it into the main cut.

But anyhow, long story short, if you have kept up with the series and have liked it, this will probably satisfy you. If you never got into these movies at the start, this one won't change your mind now. If, like me, you enjoy the movies but your interest has strayed along the way, this one may just bring you back into the fold. Not to say the negative reviews don't present any valid points, but looking at this film in the bigger context of the entire Paranormal Activity franchise, I daresay it might actually be the best one since the first one.",1453334400,,3396,4.5064935064935066

I've always just viewed these as a little bit of entertainment, and for fun. None of them were ever going to win an Oscar for acting or for best picture, they were just quick blast of tension, with a couple of random unexpected things to make you jump out of your skin now and then.

This movie was just....boring. It had none of whatever it was that made the other films enjoyable for me. Lets just say that I'm very happy that I rented it rather than bought it. I cant recommend this one, sad to say.",1452988800,,644,4.235772357723577

This final film just totally blows it however. The HUGE amount of CGI plays against everything that made the previous movies creepy, that what you don't see is scarier. The writers do tie back into the series mythology, connecting to the 3rd movie in particular, but they just squander everything by slathering on visual effects and taking everything to a climax that adds absolutely nothing to the series overall story and is a huge disappointment.",1452902400,,680,4.870689655172414

7352633,5,B012IO4TGG,"this is the best of the series.  And it uses 3d in a very inventive way.  When they use a old camera to film what's going on , you can see the evil spirits and such.  In fact this has some great shots of things coming at you and in the theater I saw this at , a person passed out.  This occurred because a black spirit comes at you and hits you  Your mind says it hit you and you shudder.  Many 3d films today are too scared to do such a shot.  Thank you paranormal for doing that kind of in your face 3d!  The story is similar to the other movies but it's much cooler this time.  The 3d blu ray is THE ONLY way to watch this movie.",1452643200,5,632,3.727272727272727
7352634,2,B012IO4TGG,"Saw it in theaters and thought it would be amazing since it's supposed to be the final film. Well I waited for something that never happened. The special effects really ruined the whole film. When you watch the first one and compare it to this one, you can see that it lost it's essence. The point of PA was that you never saw what was coming next. In Ghost Dimension you see it all before it happens and it ruined the scare. It has to be the worst final film to end a series ever made in the history of Horror franchises. Don't buy the dvd. Wait until it's $.99 cents later on. Don't waste your money.",1452556800,,602,4.153846153846154

Then I saw it was going to be available in 3-D so yes, I had to get it. 3-D definitely puts a different twist on this movie. Yes it's still a bunch of twentysomethings, in a huge house, with a little kid, with too much stuff. Storyline of same old same old so why the five stars? Because for a change, this movie tied in the first four making it seem more complete. To me that means that they had to put some thought into the storyline which again to me makes it five stars.",1452556800,12,718,4.128571428571429
7352636,1,B012IO4TGG,"Being a veteran paranormal activity fan, I expected good things from this iteration of the franchise. However what we got was a convoluted story that left more questions than it did answers.
The ghost camera was a good idea to finally  ""see"" the ghost but the way it was executed was disappointing; it was handled with bad CGI and
Deafening Lo-fi screeches does not constitute horror.
Verdict: 1/10, I would not recommend anyone to see this ""film"" or let alone buy the bluray",1452556800,,475,4.72289156626506

Excited about the find he begins to walk around filming everything. He begins to notice strange things through the lens and when he looks at tapes of movies filmed with the camera he makes a horrifying discovery. This is a series that has been on the decline ever since the first one. Each one tries to do something different than the others, and this one actually shows the activity rather then showing things happening without knowing why. This new idea makes things not as creepy to me. Seeing a chair start to rock without seeing something do it is scarier then seeing a ghost move around. This movie, however, much like every other sequel, is almost review proof. This is the 5th movie in the series and by now you are looking forward to the new one or not. As for me this is a series that should probably stop. If you can't improve on the last one don't make it. They haven't reached Batman & Robin status with the franchise yet but they are on their way. Overall, not un- watchable but another drop off from the previous one. I give this a C+.",1452470400,,1202,4.4434389140271495

7352639,1,B012IO4TGG,"Honestly, I'm not sure why I was expecting anything different?! They had a cool idea at least. Well, cool as far as ""Paranormal Activity"" (now in it's FIFTH installment) can be. There are so many places you can with this, but the route they chose went NOWHERE! Uuuugh. Such disappointment. We have here yet ANOTHER family that finds themselves wondering unknowingly into the hiding spot of a ruthless demon. Another kid that is taken over by said spirit and another ""comic relief"" character (Dan Gill) that is easily mistaken for Badger (Matt Jones) from Breaking Bad.

*******Spoilers*******

Hey Fleeges family,...you get a good deal on that house? Maybe, too good a deal? Ever wonder why? Didn't think so. Here we have the Fleeges family, Ryan (Chris J. Murray), Emily (Brit Shaw), and Leila (Ivy George). They got a smoking deal on a new house and have recently moved in. I must have missed it somewhere in the mix (or was too busy staring) when Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley) was introduced, but she's there too. I'm thinking she's a friend of Emily's, but don't hold me to it? (Honestly it doesn't even matter) Also, roughly five minutes in, we are introduced to Ryan's dimwitted brother, Mike (Dan Gill). For the most part, Mike is the only reason this movie was even bearable to watch for more than 10 seconds (after he is introduced).

They move in and quickly discover a camera that is stored away in one of the rooms. Being a typical human being, they opt to take a look through the lens and quickly realize that this camera is different from others. Not only does is have six picture tubes (instead of the usual three - who knew?!), but they can see odd visuals through it that can't be scene with their other cameras. Now,...one could chalk that up to a broken camera (which they do, at first) but instead they continue to film with it, even though they are pretty certain it's not working properly. Not only do they uncover the camera, but they also unearth a ton of old VHS tapes that they can't wait to get their grubby hands on. After watching the first, I would have probably taken them to the dump (sold the camera on eBay) and been done with it, but instead they decide they must continue and watch them all (or as many as they can). Meanwhile back to Leila......

I'm not sure about you, but when I was a kid, I was pretty much scared of ANYTHING! Had I witnessed a floating blob of pure evil (Tobi) in my bedroom at 2 AM, not only would I NOT have carried on a conversation with it, I would have pooped my pants and run out screaming for my parents! Leila doesn't react this way. The becomes friends with Tobi and ignores everyone around her.

Once again, when Ryan and Emily actually discover something is amiss, they don't pack up and leave,...NO....they decide to set up cameras and see what's what. Good plan.

You can guess what happens from here. Or maybe you can't? Either way, don't waste your time. It's a shame, because while the acting was pretty bad,..I don't blame the actors themselves. I really throw that at the writers (there are FOUR,.....F-O-U-R (4)) The material was so bad, they couldn't do anything to save it.

Final Verdict: Sit in your room with the lights off. Guarantee you it's better than sitting through this movie.",1451347200,2,3266,4.582191780821918
7352640,5,B012IO4TGG,"It was said best by film critic Chip Chipperson when he said ""Tsss""!  This film is so last year.  Boo!  One thing can be said for sure. . . The ghost loves herself!",1450483200,,164,3.909090909090909
7352641,3,B012IO4TGG,"Over the recent years, friends and family members have one by one fallen away from the Paranormal Activity movies.  PA4 is usually the final straw for people...perhaps the weakest in the series, and truly the one that felt like beating a dead horse.  Only my wife and I made it to THE MARKED ONES, and I didn't find it half bad.  Now THE GHOST DIMENSION comes along, ostensibly the finale.  First of all, I think the series needs to end because people have kinda stopped paying attention.  Even THE MARKED ONES, on opening night, attracted a full house (mostly teens)...but we saw this most recent movie on opening night with about 20 other people in the theatre.  The way it was released, with a more limited run and then followed fairly closely by VOD release indicates that even the creators know the end is nigh.

Creatively, the movie still had a few new things to offer.  My favorite is the overall premise...a new family moves into the infamous house where so many of the previous movies took place.  They discover a trove of all VHS tapes and start watching them.  And it becomes clear that the folks in these tapes, decades ago, are actually LOOKING IN AT the ""new, current day family.""  Some of this stuff was actually pretty creepy and effective.  So much of the filming style (long takes on empty rooms in the middle of the night, and nothing happens) are still in place, and they've ceased to be terribly effective.  The family members filming things long after any sane person would have dropped their camera...this has now become annoying and laughable.  This latest film ups the ante on special effects a little bit, and some of the elements of children in peril are pretty well done.  But the film still has a rushed, inconclusive and frustrating ending (like all the others except #1).  It's short, but feels longer, because so much of this is familiar ground.

I still had an okay time watching this, and if you've stuck the series out this long, go ahead and take a look.  If you are unfamiliar with the films or abandoned them somewhere along the way, there is no reason to think you should spend time with this film.

One final, IMPORTANT note:  We saw this movie in 3D.  DON'T BOTHER.  For a big chunk of the film, I thought the 3D was off...I kept taking my glasses off to check and really couldn't see a difference with or without.  Occasionally, this ""entity"" shows up that pops out in 3D a bit...but trust me, it is not worth even an extra 10 cents to upgrade to 3D for this film!",1450310400,3,2507,4.522222222222222
7352642,2,B012IO4TGG,"If you are hoping for anything other than exactly what you expect, don't bother. Yes, you do get to see more of the ""ghosts"" than previous entires and there's some decent use of 3D and special effects. Whether that makes it better or worse is up for debate.  It's just the same pacing and plot. Things moves, people don't leave, cameras are deployed, cue ominous bass.
I'm a fan of ""found footage"" when done well, and this franchise has at least had some chilling moments throughout its run. It's not even that this franchise is bad, and if you are actually into the ""mythology"" of this series it might be enough to be enjoyable. It's just not enough to ever be scary or to be called a good film. Worth it for big fans of the series only.",1450224000,9,738,4.3478260869565215
