8335910,5,B001QJTP5K,I watched it over and over and have made plans on how to make my loft better.  It has been a real help.,1400284800,,103,3.4782608695652173
8335911,4,B001QJTP5K,"Jenner & co. have produced a very, very interesting DVD on a very, very difficult matter; and although there are examples ad lib. I miss out on the ""basics of ventilation"", a chapter that might turn this educational production into a ""must see"" for everyone in the project of constructing (or changing) a pigeon loft. I feel left back with an impression of ""this just might work"" - not the ABC of ""how to make it work"" - but perhaps this is the essence of the matter: no ""one solution fits all"" do exist in reality. At least any person watching this DVD will definitely be armed with a lot of inspirations and ideas.",1320969600,,616,4.412280701754386
8335912,5,B001QJTP5K,"I cannot believe how much information was packed into this movie! Some of the secrets are so intuitive, I can't believe I hadn't thought of them. This is such a great deal, thank you Mr. Jenner... you always seem to know what I'm interested in learning more about!",1299628800,,264,4.520833333333333
