7002357,1,B00T6SZNOA,A great movie to experience if only MST3K were still around to make comments of it.,1432944000,,83,4.25
7002358,1,B00T6SZNOA,"I have no idea what this movie is about because it is so boring, I kept falling asleep. Reading the phone book would have
been more entertaining.",1432771200,4,145,4.407407407407407
7002359,4,B00T6SZNOA,I'll admit I had to watch parts over and I started last night watched some this morning and finished it this afternoon. It's a complex concept with a few extra concepts thrown in. But... i wanted to finish it. I think the critical reviews are a little harsh,1511827200,,257,4.375
7002360,4,B00T6SZNOA,"....it is true that this movie is hard to follow in the beginning, but if you stick with it, even if it does seem to go off into left field, there is a payoff at the end. The acting is really good as the players are asked to take on some pretty challenging scenes and did a great job doing it. If you are one of the single star folks rating this, take the time to go back and watch it again, I think you will find it is worth more than one star. This is very good sci fi within a genre of young adult to adult I haven't seen before. I liked it a lot. Don't follow the reviews on this so much and just take the time to watch it all the way through yourself. I think you will agree with me on this.",1511481600,,696,3.741496598639456

7002362,5,B00T6SZNOA,"It's a mindbender. I loved it, but you need to be ok with a very twisting, winding plot structure. The packaging of this film is confusing, for what it is. But then again, it would be hard to package a film which doesn't fit comfortably into a single genre. But it has a payoff. I had to watch it more than once.",1506643200,,312,4.048387096774194
7002363,5,B00T6SZNOA,"Lowbrows Beware! If you're not into intellectual thrillers, you won't appreciate this film! Hopefully, less texting while driving as a result of this psychological gem!",1505433600,,168,5.76
7002364,1,B00T6SZNOA,tip of the hat for those who managed to watch to the end. My heroes.,1499040000,,68,3.6
7002365,2,B00T6SZNOA,title and description make no sense the whole story is nothing but a story of letting a friend in a coma pass to the after life . Really not worth 2 stars,1496016000,,154,3.84375
7002366,1,B00T6SZNOA,the movie just made no sense. the girl is just bouncing around different realities if you want to call it that. i had to stop the movie after 30 minutes of sheer nonsense.,1495929600,,171,4.212121212121212
7002367,1,B00T6SZNOA,This is the dumbest movie I have seen in a long time. I think I lost some brain cells watching this garbage. Why?,1492905600,,113,3.9565217391304346
7002368,1,B00T6SZNOA,this is clearly a joke,1492732800,,22,3.6
7002369,4,B00T6SZNOA,"This is a very unusual script no matter what genre it is marketed as.  It seems to be more of a psychological mystery than a sci-fi.
I liked it but found it hard to watch at times and not always with enough patience to see the outcomes.  It does seem to be about choices as well as quantum understanding. It seems to be more about possibilities, love, and acceptance, than about fiction. So, I give it an A for being unique along with transcendental. I like the actors and the general script. I guess we all have our ""black holes"" and we all have to look in the mirror in order to find our way.",1490745600,,594,4.156521739130435

7002371,1,B00T6SZNOA,I only wish I could give it zero stars. You will regret any time you waste on this movie.,1487808000,,89,3.736842105263158
7002372,5,B00T6SZNOA,"Think you want to be in someone else's head. Think again! This film explores the theory of Quantum Exchanges. Five main characters drive the narrative with the added extra of interesting secondary ones. It moves at a quick pace and brought this viewer through a full range of emotions. The music was excellent. The ending did not disappoint. Recommended for viewers that enjoy supernatural sci-fi without much violence and for those who appreciate science in new, interesting ways.",1486771200,2,481,5.17948717948718

7002377,4,B00T6SZNOA,"Forget the title, forget the poster, forget this being classified as sci-fi. If you are looking for a space adventure -- and given the way it's presented, who could blame you -- you are being set up for disappointment. Instead, this is a very interesting and trippy psychological, philosophical piece, not unlike something David Lynch would do. It's well written, well acted, well directed, and has a tight musical score. I really enjoyed it, but I'm probably more able to roll with whatever comes than some audiences. I don't know what caused them to change the title from ""The Mind's Eye"" to ""The Black Hole"". but it was a bad move, and whoever made that poster image to represent this lovely movie should be fired.",1483056000,6,717,4.744
7002378,1,B00T6SZNOA,"Very misleading title. It has nothing to do with blackholes, just a ditzy girl experiencing hallucinations.",1482969600,3,107,5.75

7002381,5,B00T6SZNOA,"I have Amazon Prime on my Roku, and I just watched this move, not often a movie hits a cord with me, but his movie, if you like sci-fi, alternant realities, and awesome twists, and ok I will quit nurding out now, it's a good movie. Lately when I watch movies, I don't feel anything I guess after watching a life time of movies, they become dull, but this movie moved me with feelings. I can say it will do the same for anyone else, I liked it.",1482192000,2,443,4.045454545454546

7002390,5,B00T6SZNOA,"I just watched this on prime. The title isn't well chosen but setting that aside, the movie was excellent. Some reviewers described it as Twilight Zone, but when it is finally reviewed that it is love and hate trapped in a teenage mind, the show makes sense. Hopefully each of us has someone in life who we have a deep connection to. Even more so, I hope each of us matters so much to another human that they/we can't let each other go. In a day and age of disposable everything, It is refreshing to explore our meaning to others.

Maybe I'm not normal, but this movie had great meaning for me.",1472688000,3,594,4.303571428571429
7002391,1,B00T6SZNOA,Very bizarre movie - it will give you a headache trying to follow it.  Only watch it if you don't have anything better to do.,1472515200,,125,4.0

7002403,1,B00T6SZNOA,"Insufficient special effects, drama, scientific explanations, intellectual debate, and actors were not convincing. (Anemic acting)",1436745600,,130,7.733333333333333
7002404,4,B00T6SZNOA,"The story centers are Mattie Carver (Izzie Steele) who is a high school student with reality issues. Scenes, as well as people and places change around her. An explanation is offered at the Revelation Church, but it may not be complete. This is an odd production that would be a 60's acid film.

The film is science fiction, but only as a background to the events.  The film is self described as ""A sci-fi/thriller centered on a high school violinist who witnesses the collapse of space and time."" This explanation may be correct, but it does not exactly come out in the film itself, but other explanations are offered. The original title of the film was ""Mind's Eye."" There is a movie theater poster with this title as Mattie says she would like to see that film. This surreal comic reference is lost with the title change. In fact the title alters the explanation to the collapse of space and time from the explanation offered in the film. I suggest the title change and time/space collapse explanation was done for marketing and does a disservice to the film and Mark Steven Grove, director and writer of the film.

4 stars for the bizarre. Not for everyone. If you like this type of film, check out ""Foxfur"" which may be free on line somewhere. DVDs were never produced for the market.

Guide; No swearing, sex, or nudity. Natalie Distler is short plaid skirt.",1436054400,3,1364,4.62396694214876
7002405,4,B00T6SZNOA,"This movie is hard to discuss without spoiling certain things, but I shall do my best. Mark Steven Grove's latest directorial effort is a genre-bending sci-fi drama. Dean Cain gives a very good performance, one that is pretty different from his usual action fare (""Dark Descent"", etc.). He is very lighthearted and fun. Izzie Steele plays the lead, Mattie Carver. For someone who has been acting for just a few years, she gives a dynamic and engaging performance, and convincingly sells the whacked out things that are happening. Malcolm McDowell has a fun little role.

The cinematography is lush and beautiful, with a very dreamlike quality which fits. The editing is excellent and precise, with some impressive dissolves and hidden cuts that make the transitions from the various realities very cool, visually. The script though, isn't quite as good. This is specifically talking about the story. There are certain things that just don't add up- a character at the end that either is imagined, or real but only one person can see her, huh?

But despite that, and that this runs 10 minutes too long (the middle has some repetitive scenes), the movie is mounted well enough to overcome these issues.",1434067200,2,1200,4.965174129353234
7002406,1,B00T6SZNOA,I gave this movie a chance b/c I like Dean Cain. But even he could not save this movie. I kept falling a sleep about 20 minutes in. Take my advise even Superman could not save this movie. Save your money.,1433376000,2,204,4.0
7002407,1,B00T6SZNOA,"Uhh, I thought it was going to be SciFi!
Plus, I was hoping for some mean, twisted Malcom McDowell...

7002408,3,B00T6SZNOA,"The working title---and it's mentioned in the end-credits---""Mind's Eye"" is a more appropriate title for this movie.
The cover art makes it LOOK like it's a disaster movie. It is NOT. It is a mind trip with quantum physics' problems

 With all those older---and there will be newer---movies with the same title, buy this BLACK HOLE only if you have
two hours' of spare time.
Repeat: this is NOT a disaster movie, though the movie---itself---MAY be a disaster if you can't/won't follow along.
 IF your mind wanders while t-r-y-i-n-g to figure out what the hell you're watchin', take an intermission, ingest some
caffeine, pop some corn, and continue scratching your head.

8700649,1,B00T6SZNOA,I can't imagine why Dean Cain and Malcolm McDowell agreed to be in this film.  Their good sense must have been sucked into a black hole.,1529798400,,136,4.230769230769231
8700650,3,B00T6SZNOA,"Unlike most movies on this theme this story has both a clear point and a satisfactory explanation.  A very strong suspension of disbelief is required to appreciate this movie.  The science and premise is simply a tool in which to tell a story that is distorted in time, space, and perceived reality.  At first the experience is jagged, isolating, and confusing.  I found that to be a useful tool for setting the audience off-balance in the same way the characters are.
I particularly enjoyed the ambiguity of the ending.  The ability of Maddie to move on in her life in what appears to be a short time to older folk makes sense in the life of a teen.",1529366400,,650,4.47457627118644
8700651,3,B00T6SZNOA,"Very strange movie.  Impossible to follow or figure out ... even at the end.  I like time-space continuum and alternate reality themes, but this was really unusual.  Not in a bad way ... just didn't make much sense.",1516752000,,215,4.605263157894737

8700653,5,B00T6SZNOA,The film moves very fast but still does a great job of developing the characters and a twisted plot. The ending wrapped the story up in a way that left me very satisfied.,1514851200,,170,4.181818181818182

8700655,5,B00T6SZNOA,This clip shows how out of the world the modern scientific world has become on alternate reality. It is good to see Hollywood run with the stupidity of the people who believe in an alternate existence.  I may be wrong but each and every decision we make can not possibly end in a whole new universe exiting? Then for them to cross over into each other? It is so much easier to just believe in God and to go from there??? It takes more faith to get into the science than it does to just know God. This proves a point to me. I have been to the other side and know the truth and the new theory of some other time and some other place has not been proven to me but the existence of God has! Worth watching no matter what you want to buy. make your mind up and we will see.  SOME TIME?,1512604800,,780,3.961783439490446
