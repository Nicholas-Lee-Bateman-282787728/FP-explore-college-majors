8490422,5,B0060KGSFU,"Thoroughly enjoyed this psychological thriller. Delivered very promptly,arrived yesterday,watched late last night with the lights low. Creepy George Macready plays another psycho and he's an absolute joy to watch in action. He had much fun in the steamroom,almost killing Jim Bannon. Laughed when he was getting the neck massage,plotting and scheming. Was supposed to be part of the I Love A Mystery package,but done as a separate film,not part of the series.",1470096000,,459,5.388888888888889
