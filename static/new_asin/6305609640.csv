1064051,5,6305609640,"Could there possibly be a more universally loved actor than Tom Cruise... I don't think so, and these three movies prove it best. In all three he is at his most charismatic and they are three of his most popular. I will now  reveiw them individualy.  TOP GUN. The film that cemented Tom's career. It  is pure entertainment. Thrilling fight scenes, a good love story that  doesn't detract from the action. Anthony Edwards is great as the sidekick  and Meg Ryan is also great in a small part. Sit back and enjoy. DAY'S OF  THUNDER. ""Top Gun on Wheel's"". Again a great cast and Brilliant  directing make a possibly average movie brilliant. Nicole makes a top love  interest aswell. Robert Duvall is a standout. MISSION INPOSSIBLE. Many  people found this a little confuseing at first, (even me) but on second  veiwing it became one of my favourite movies of all time. The plot twists  are great, the action is greater, plus, one of the best climaxs on film.  (or in this case.. on DVD)",945043200,7,982,4.580459770114943

7893618,5,6305609640,"I was hesitant to order something ""used"" as I have never done that before.  The item came in ""like new"" condition and all movies played just fine.  I got the set for my husband and he was very happy with the purchase.",1358899200,,217,4.142857142857143
7893619,3,6305609640,"This was purchased years ago and I remember watching the videos and finding that the picture quality was less than I expected. Maybe that was becasue I was watching it on a 62"" HD tv that showed more definition than the movie was orignally recorded on DVD and intended to be viewed?",1325808000,,282,4.4423076923076925
7893620,5,6305609640,"First, I must say that the fact that I found this set at a bargain-priced fifty bucks could be a major motive in me giving this Tom Cruise Action Pack such a great rating. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that this set is worthy of five stars. Tom Cruise is a blockbuster only type actor, and it definitely shows in this DVD set. The best of the bunch would have to be Top Gun, and that is for its ability to keep you coming back to watch it again and again. Days of Thunder definitely has the same type of appeal that Top Gun has, with Cruise being a young gun that has to face many challenges and ultimately becomes the best of the best. Mission Impossible is different from the other two, mostly because of its plot, which at times can be nearly insane. Mission Impossible still shows off Cruise's heroic character in dazzling action sequences regardless of how lost you may be in its story. The bottom line here is that this DVD set is a desirable addition to your collection and is a must for any Tom Cruise fan. These movies do exactly what they need to do; entertain. They aren't epics or love stories; they're action movies, and Cruise makes sure that they are respected through his stellar performances.",991785600,2,1211,4.434977578475336
7893621,5,6305609640,Each of the three movies in this collection are classic Tom Cruise. The  only problem you may have is that you might already have one of them. That  really doesn't matter since the price is still cheaper than buying two of  them separately!,968284800,,240,4.534883720930233
7893622,5,6305609640,"This is the best ""Bundle"" pack that you can get to show off your  home theater system.  The surround sound from ""Top Gun"" and  ""Days of Thunder"" really push your home theater speakers to the  limit!  After watching all 3 movies in my friends house, I can't wait  untill I recieve my order!!!",968284800,,291,4.39622641509434
7893623,5,6305609640,"One Name: TOM CRUISE - This series presents Tom Cruise at his versitile  best.  First as the cocky fighter pilot Maverick in Top Gun - the movie  that put the team of Bruckheimer and Simpson on the map.  It stars Kelly  McGillis as Charlie, Val Kilmer as the Iceman and Anthony Edwards as Goose.  This is one of the few movies that everyone I know can quote a line from.
Then there's Days of Thunder the movie infamous because it signals the  meeting of Tom and Nichole his future wife.  A great story of Tom at his  cocky best learning some hard lessons on life and Race Car Driving from  veteran actor Robert Duval.  One thing Tom has always done is pair himself  with good talent.  Great popcorn flick.
And finally Mission Impossible -  The debut of Tom as Ethan Hunt and the first in a new franchise.  Espionage, thrills, chills this one has it all, and plently of style to  burn with Brian DePalma at the helm.  Tom produced this one, a first for  him as producer, and again surrounded himself with killer talent - John  Voight, Ving Rhames, John Reno, and of course the scene stealer, veteran  british stage actress Vanessa Redgrave.  This movie rocks!
You can't go  wrong with this deal.  Get yours today; I've got mine!",968284800,5,1227,4.4772727272727275
