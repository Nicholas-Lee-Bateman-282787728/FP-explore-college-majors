8329749,4,B001O6YH44,I love these outdoors dvd's they are really good especially if you probably won't make it there kinda lets you feel like you are there,1372291200,,134,4.4
8329750,1,B001O6YH44,"This is a perfect video for the stay-at-home eco-tourist who want to substantiate their preconceived notions about climate change without ever examining or understanding the science.  Full of one narrcistic t.v. personality and several made-for-tv, mantra-chanting professors out on a well-funded jaunt through parts of Alaska using internal cumbustion enegines that add to the global warming issue to which this video addresses.  Add to that one silly ultra-light and its noise pollution.  There is an air of 'science' to the narrative, but, for those who listen carefully, there is no substance, just innuendo and conjecture.  Poorly edited, poorly scripted, poorly cast.",1344729600,2,673,5.633663366336633
