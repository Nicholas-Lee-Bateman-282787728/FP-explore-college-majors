2509416,5,B000E8N8L6,"They finally are going to release this. I saw Born Into This in a small theater in NY. I have always been a big fan of Bukowski ever since a friend loaned me ""Roominghouse Madrigals"". I corresponded with CB briefly just before his death.

I have always felt that eventhough Bukowski was/is incredibly famous by any ""poet"" measure, he has been sadly overlooked by the scholarly crowd. I can't imagine anybody reading a substantial portion of his work and not agreeing with me that Buk was one of the most influential and important writers of the last century. There have been several biographies written about Buk, none of which did him justice. This film is the first one in my opinion. You get a real feel for what made him tick, his genius and at times his recklessness. You also get a look at the love he had for his last wife and her unflailing patience with him.

The entire film is entertaining, touching, educational and everything else you could ask for.

My recommendation is see this even if the only connection you have to Buk is watching Barfly. You'll be picking up Post Office in no time.",1137715200,67,1102,4.555555555555555

Matt Dillon did a follow up also written by Bukowksi. I bought ten of his books and it is like reading emails. Easy to read and I feel that I myself am close to his memories too. I drank in some of the same bars he drank in. I never met him in person. In ""Bar Fly"" he was in the Kenmore Bar, (no longer on 3rd street). That was my hang out too.

2509424,5,B000E8N8L6,"This is one of those rare documentaries that should appeal to viewers who are newcomers to the Charles Bukowski mystique and also to those of us who know a lot about him.  It covers his biography, from the abusive childhood (in a chilling clip, Hank is filmed at the house where the abuse occurred), to the post office years, to the significant women/womanizing.  Some attention is also given to the influence he had on other artists, such as Steve Richmond, Tom Waits, and Bono.  We see Hank at his best (being a father, and thoughtfully discussing Life at the end of his own life) and worst (cursing and kicking his last wife, Linda).  At the end, I felt I knew him as well as anyone can know a born loner, and was left wanting to read more of his writing and learn more about his life.  It was a rich life, with a lot of hardships (often self-inflicted), which should inspire many of us with slightly raggedy lives to achieve meaningful art.",1407974400,4,944,4.465116279069767

How easy it would be to imagine him working for the post office for 30 years and then writing poetry and stories in a dingy apartment that only a few hundred readers of an underground newspaper would ever read.  It's fascinating to hear how getting beaten by his father every day ""stripped away all the pretension"" out of his writing and left only what was honest.

2509428,5,B000E8N8L6,"As a die hard Bukowski fan, I of course had to watch this documentary. I must say though, there was so much about him I didn't know, which I learned in this film.  Very informative, and really covers every single part of his life, from his childhood up until his death. I also loved that it was filled with footage of Bukowski himself, doing interviews, poetry readings, etc.  Another added bonus was that Tom Waits was interviewed in this doc...which in and of itself was enough reason to watch it, as I simply love Tom Waits! I was so mesmerized by this film, that I could not stop thinking about it for days...one poem in particular, ""Bluebird"" which Bukowski himself reads aloud, hasn't left my mind.  Prior to watching this doc, I'd never heard that poem so one more reason I'm so glad I watched it.  In fact, I loved this movie so much, that only 4 days later I invited a fellow Bukowski loving friend of mine over to watch it w/ me :)  He was just as impressed! Even for those of you who don't know a whole lot about Bukowski, I'd recommend watching this...as it's just chock full of pertinent information.

2509434,5,B000E8N8L6,"There are certain small members of modern day society who cannot live like most people do.  They cannot get up every morning and work a routine job, raise children, or hold long relationships.  Something must have occurred during their developmental phase that made them this way; it is hard to tell if they were ""born this way"" or they became this way through their life experiences.  On many occasions, these individuals are prisoners or criminals.  They can also be artists.

I believe I have not read the poetry or writing of Charles Bukowski.  I learned about him many years ago and saw the poor film 'Barfly' (based on him) some years ago.  Just recently, I began to learn more about him and his writings.  To me, there is no doubt that he was an extremely gifted poet.  He was a kind of 'real poet'; one who wrote about real problems about his life and society, and not one who wrote about fluffy things like flowers and nature.  He grew up in an abusive household, he had trouble holding a job all his life, he was a severe alcoholic, and he lived on skid row most of his life.  At times, it is very sad and moving.  At times, the viewer may be in complete disgust with Bukowski.

A tremendous amount of prosperity exists in the United States, but at the same time, a great underclass exists (and this underclass seems to be growing with each passing year).  This underclass may never know 'The American Dream', and Bukowski was the kind of writer that spoke to those people.  The film 'Born Into This' is a wonderful documentary about his life and his writings.  It tries to have an objective viewpoint about his life by showing the great talents but also the great flaws of the man.  He was far from 'perfect', but which human being is if they open themselves up to the world?

Why was Bukowski what way he was?  That is question even the most trained psychologists cannot answer.  But, maybe we should not even seek that answer.  Perhaps, through his poetry, we can learn something about ourselves and modern day society.",1320192000,2,2032,4.542699724517906
2509435,5,B000E8N8L6,"This biopic is truly a must for avid Bukowski fans. The man was a legend in his own time, though he roamed under the radar for decades before being published. His lifestyle was so typical 1950's southern Californa that it brings back images of growing up middle-classed and Catholic in my own mind. Buy it!!!",1285718400,,308,4.618181818181818
2509436,5,B000E8N8L6,"Frankly, I thought I'd outgrown the beatniks, my high school heroes who motivated me to be a geek without apologies.  I was initially thrilled to hear and meet in person the likes of Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, William Burroughs (never caught Kerouac, though he of course was #1).  But by the time I got to graduate school, the primary appeal of the beats was their attraction to jazz and their aesthetic passivity (T. S. Eliot's definition of art--if it moves you to ""do"" something, it's propaganda), all of which distinguished them from the ""group-think"" of the '60s flower children, the Dylan (Bob) acolytes, the Woodstock generation--a lot of hair covering empty heads filled with little knowledge of art, literature, the past.  Still that distinction didn't earn for their predecessors, the Beats, the respect I'd developed for Chaucer, Shakespeare, Donne, the Romantics and the ""Lyrical Ballads,"" Keats, R. Browning and Pound.

But Bukowski is a seducer, a curious combination of utter, disarming honesty and fascinating, even charming ""performance artist.""  He's not an unattractive man, and he possesses just enough of a lisp to muffle, elevate, and lend a touch of playful mischief to the brutality, sexism, tough talk--and frequent resorting to the scatological and  the bottle (the latter an escape, an excuse, a ""prop"" essential to his ""act"" when reading in public performance).  Like Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, he was a heavy drinker, but had any of America's literary alcoholics been capable of living up to their reputations as drunks, it's unlikely few would have produced the body of work we associate with their names.

The film makes clear that, far from a free spirit, Bukowski was a highly disciplined machine when his survival depended upon it.  He could work interminable hours at a mindless post office job.  It comes as no surprise, then, to learn about his obsession with writing, his prolific output despite mountains of rejections to match it.  Like most writers (and orchestrators) he forced himself through countless hours of writing--unshowered, ungroomed, subsisting on""Payday"" candy bars as nourishment--quickly adopting the self-description ""dirty old man"" (a phrase that seems tailor-made for writers).  The man pre-dates and outwrites the beats (forget about the hippies) because of his work ethic, unflinching honesty, and freedom from all illusions.  Asked when he ""realized"" he was a writer, he answers: ""You don't realize you're a writer. You think you're writer.""

For the amateur psychologizers, Bukowski's insecurity and its possible sources are all too apparent, from his extremely pock-marked face, near-diminutive stature, and frequent beatings suffered at his father's hands (or whip).  In one sense, he answered the brutality he had received with his own version of it--a facade that most viewers (and listeners) should have no trouble penetrating.  Bukowski mocks the American dream and the illusions it fosters, especially among the young--or the parents of all those gifted children.  Life is exceedingly tough in Bukowski's world.  He acknowledges it, but then dares you to deal with it.  Unlike Steinbeck and the Romantics (including their descendants, the Beatniks, who retained a Whitman-like wanderlust and mysticism toward nature), Bukowski doesn't appear to have left the bars and gutters long enough to discover the world of nature--followed by the inevitable disillusionment.  He simply has no illusions.

He likes to reduce life's complexities, including love/sex, to a power game, but the viewer senses it's a game for him, a role he's expected to play and is good at. (Good enough to make the viewer hate him for a few brief moments during the film.)  What the film fails to do is reveal the work habits of the writer--from conception to implementation (pen? pencil? typewriter? revisions? time of day? Did he, like Faulkner, go into an alcoholic stupor upon completion of a manuscript?)  On the other hand, the movie, despite lots of fuzzy and non-cinematic images, also has lots of Bukowski--and that's enough.  None of the acquaintances, friends, women, wives, publishers  who are interviewed seem very interesting--but probably because they suffer by comparison with Bukowski himself.  And though it tries to fulfill viewers' expectations of Bukowski the filthy animal, the evidence argues to the contrary.  The man's ""poetry"" is admittedly prosaic (the comparison of him, in the movie, to Wordsworth is not completely off the mark),  but it's original, imaginative, and it's more about straight-talk and truth than self-aggrandizement.  Which is not to say that he doesn't come off as potentially dangerous--especially to women seduced not by his vulnerability (that's Chet Baker) but  by his power and apparent virility along with his capacity to be self-aware and, yes, vulnerable as well (we hear him singing to his beloved the old standard ""Mean to Me"").

If you want the story of a sexual libertine, go to Lord Byron or Larry Flynt; if you want the scatological, check out ""The Aristocrats.""  For Bukowski, sex is a metaphor--moreover, it's his only one, allowing him to avoid the painful subject of love.  At one point, the metaphor fails him.  While reading a poem about a woman, he chokes up and curses the interviewer for getting him to read it.  He also cries at his wedding.  And by now he at least has the good sense not to blame the officiating minister.

One caveat, or warning:  Best ignore the sophomoric attempts by some of the film's talking heads to explain Bukowski's ""art."" The film's director attempts to bring closure through the use of a scrap of a poem, a didactic one at that, representing Bukowki as significant because, above all, he somehow liberated spirit from the restrictive limits of poetic form (tell that to Shakespeare or Keats).  But putting the scrap of paper aside, the movie allows us to see that Bukowski himself was, no less than his published works (or, in his case, his ""effluence"") an avatar, a work of art by virtue of his not merely writing about life but living it.  It's unlikely the viewer will find much that's ""spiritual"" in the film or its subject.  But you will meet a spirited man--carnal, profane, scrappy but also courageous, unflinchingly honest, and inarguably talented.  I'll risk one last thought that came to mind while watching Bukowski in this film: he's the common man's Henry Miller.",1256256000,7,6450,5.19825918762089
2509437,4,B000E8N8L6,"Back in the early 1970's, well- before he became a cult figure of some stature, someone, somewhere directed me to some articles written by the king of ""gonzo"" journalist, the late Doctor Hunter S. Thompson for the then radical political/musical ""Rolling Stone"" magazine. Readers of this space are well aware of my affection for the writings of the good doctor. Around that same time the same person who ""turned me on to"" Thompson, as the expression of the day went, also mentioned that if I liked Thompson then I would definitely go for the then emerging Los Angeles literary cult figure under review here, Charles Bukowski.

I then read some of Bukowski's stuff, mainly poetry from the various ""little"" presses like City Light but I was not that impressed. Later, in the late 1980's, when the movie ""Barfly"", starting Mickey Rourke as Bukowski, came out I again tried to read his work, this time mainly the novels. Still no sale. Now, however, with this rather well done documentary that details the ups and downs of this literary figure who may have had the same kind of feel for the dispossessed, the ""street people"" of L.A. that his near contemporary Nelson Algren had for Chicago I think I have to take another look.

This documentary puts together the various aspects of Bukowski's life (and incidentally demonstrates how tough it is to be an avant guarde artist in America) from his broken childhood to his struggle to find work, but most importantly, his struggle to write with the deck stacked against him. Add in a mercurial personality, some physical facial deformities (due to severe facial acne) and a very heavy drinking problem, including periods of abusive behavior to his girlfriends and others, to help drown his sorrows and one does not get a pretty picture. The film also gives enough snippets of his work (including some readings by Bukowski himself) to intrigue me to go back and check him out.

But here is the kicker. I am always on the lookout for those who will speak for the dispossessed (like Algren, James T. Farrell, the young Dos Passos, etc.) even if there is no direct political linkage. Maybe I missed something before. Moreover, the ""talking heads"" that naturally populate a documentary like this included Tom Wait, Sean Penn, Bono, and Harry Dean Stanton. These are the same guys who provided commentary on a couple of Hunter Thompson documentaries that I have reviewed in this space recently. So, maybe I did miss something. Who would have thought?",1238112000,,2485,4.856132075471698
2509438,5,B000E8N8L6,"So John Martin, Black Sparrow publisher, describes Bukowsky in John Dullaghan's film bio ""Born Into This.""  Tom Waits, one of the friends of Bukowsky interviewed in the film,* says something similar.

This ""writer for the man-in-the-street"" mantra is pretty frequently invoked when speaking about Bukowsky, but I don't buy it.  It seems to canned, too ready-to-hand.  Certain Bukowsky's prose and his narrative poems are written in a sparse, deliberately frill-less style.  Perhaps this is what prompts so many ""man in the street"" descriptions.  But it seems to me that Bukowsky is above all a chronicler not of the common man, but of Bukowski.  There are few authors whose work is more autobiographical.  Everywhere, even in Pulp, Bukowski's primary subject is himself.  And whatever else one can say about him, whether you love or can't stomach his stuff (I fall somewhere in between), one thing's for certain:  he wasn't your common guy in the street.

On one level, Dullagham's film is an excellently crafted biography of Bukowski's exterior life, interspersed with marvelous footage of Bukowksi at poetry readings as well as private interviews (there's also the famous clip of a drunken and enraged Bukowski kicking his wife, Linda Lee).  We get a feel not only for the celebrity Bukowski, but also an appreciation of his devotion, as one of his acquaintances says, to the ""de-Disneyification of America"" through his in-your-face writings.

But one another level--the one at which the film really shines--we get a glimpse of the inner, fragile, lonely Bukowski.  The exterior Bukowski at times outmachos a Hemingway or a Mailer, is an obnoxious drunk, and a disgustingly nasty misanthrope.  But the inner Bukowski is the kid who was regularly and savagely beaten by his father, ignored by his mother, overwhelmed by life, stuck in a mind- and body-killing job, unrequited in love, shunned by peers.  This Bukowski is wounded, telling one interviewer that love is as fleeting as morning fog; writes in a poem that ""there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out""; and in one of the film's most poignant scenes, breaks down weepinig as he reads a poem, ""The Shower,"" mourning his lost love Linda King:  ""Linda, you brought it to me.  When you take it away, do it slowly and easily.  Make it as if I was dying in my sleep instead of awake""; and, in describing the manic-bedhopping that served as the basis of his novel Women, softly confesses to an interviewer that he eventually stopped because ""I became ashamed of what I was doing.""

I make no predictions about Bukowski's enduring place in American letters.  But I do know that Dullagham's excellent film has helped me better appreciate new depths in Bukowski the man and the artist.  And for that, I highly recommend it.

2509440,5,B000E8N8L6,"Pork Chops with Chinasky
By Christopher C. Happ 2008

A review of:
Born into This
 Magnolia home entertainment 2003

I am interested in the great authors of the 20th century.  I have studied the Beats: Kerouac, Burroughs, Corso, Ginsberg and other 20th century writers like, Hemingway, Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Upton Sinclair, Dos Passos, Kafka and many others.  I have had a fascination for the less than mainstream writers like Hunter S. Thompson and lately, Charles Bukowski.  I did not read Bukowski in the 20th century.  I had heard of him and even saw his books on the shelves at City Lights bookstore, the home and spawning grounds of the Beats, although Bukowski never felt a part of that group.  His work was innovative, talking about the seedier side of our existence.

I was sorry that I came to his work, so late.  In honor of the man, I prepared a pork chop dinner and drank cheap beer and wine to get in the mood.  He used the pseudonym Henry (Hank) Chinaski, in his novels and in Barfly, starring, Faye Dunaway and Mickey Rourke.

This is a glimpse of a 20th century writer, like many at that time, a heavy drinker and womanizer.  Bukowski was as comfortable in a bar fight as he was at a poetry reading.  Like many writers, he talks about the need to write, in order to understand this life and keep him from going crazy.

The documentary opens with Bukowski at a poetry reading in San Francisco at Lawrence Ferlinghetti's, Poet's theater. Founder of City Lights and publisher of many a Beat writer.
There is a refrigerator on stage and he drinks beer after beer and wine while reading his work and chiding naysayers in the audience. ""One more beer and I'll take you all!""

Bukowski started out writing poetry and short stories, which he submitted to the top magazines at the time, like Atlantic Monthly.  Finally, one of his stories was published and he wrote hundreds of poems.  The movie Barfly based on his life, a blur of alcohol, women, cigarettes and a trail of meaningless odd jobs.  As most writers, the passion for writing was a driving force, eclipsing all else. He lived in drab flophouse rooms and went from job to job.

The documentary shows Bukowski in the 1970's, on his way up and the 1990's, after he had arrived.  We watch him read poetry, play the horses and there are interviews with his women and publisher John Martin, of Black Sparrow Press.  Martin offered Bukowski $100 per month for life, after tallying his monthly living expenses. ($80 for rent, $19 for food and $3.50 for cigarettes.) That was in the 1960's and of course, any writer would jump at the chance to have such a stipend to be able to write full-time.  His work started in the LA Free Press and Martin published chapbooks of his poetry.  His column Notes of a Dirty Old Man got him recognized.  Martin asked him to write a novel, because of the much greater financial possibilities.
A good biography of Bukowkski is, Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life, (1998 Howard Sounes)

His first novel: Post Office, (1971 Black Sparrow Books.), about his life working for the post office as a temporary carrier and clerk, a job he truly hated.  In the late 1980's Martin raised his monthly stipend to $8,000 per month.  The success of his works led to a house in San Pedro, a BMW, an Acura, a Macintosh computer and the ability to pay cash for them.

He wrote Ham on Rye, (1982 Harper Collins.) the story of his childhood and adolescence. He had acne vulgaris and in his words, ""Was not a pretty guy"" He describes regular beatings by his father with a razor strop and the alienation he encountered in school due to the acne and boils. His novel,  Factotum , ( 1975, Harper Collins.), now also a  movie, is a running account of his years as a bum, drinking, fighting, smoking and doing odd menial jobs.

Bukowski was a misogynist and unlucky at love. The documentary is a great insight into his life in his later years.  He was really getting famous in the 1970's and died in 1993.  The documentary is a portrait of a tortured writer and his disregard for the establishment.  A story of redemption; although he drank, gambled and womanized until his death.  Bukowski's story gives me hope. Hope that the art in one's soul can eventually lead to a life unencumbered by the 9-5 thing, with enough to live on and the ability to put all energies into one's art.  This film is insightful of a writer's life and a slice of literary history.  Bukowski had more than forty books published, some novels: Women, (1978) Hollywood, (1989) and a variety of poetry and short stories.",1207008000,2,4568,4.580049261083744
2509441,5,B000E8N8L6,"Sometimes, things can creep up on you and slap you right across the face, unsuspecting, as if you not only saw it coming -- but didn't know that you were about to get a beat down. There are no words I can use to describe the way I felt after watching this movie other than `kicked into submission'. Charles Henry Bukowski is not what I thought going into this film, and he definitely was far more than I ever imagined coming out.

This is a must see film for anyone interested in writing, poetry or Bukowski. This is also a must see documentary for anyone who wants, or needs to know what it is like to work away in obscurity like you never had right to a voice, never had a chance or anyone on your side who believed in you - and you felt as if you were never going to rise above it. While Bukowski had hopes and dreams that he would rise to fame, he felt `shielded by God' for years, making him suffer in exile wanting him to hone his craft in pain and anguish. Sound familiar?

The film covers Bukowski from a few angles. One is from the eyes and mind of a Documentary Filmmaker who had captured most of the Bukowski footage presented here, which is absolutely captivating. Another is from the perspective of his Publisher who had founded Black Sparrow Press, which comes across as a bit dry and dull but lightly interesting. Other perspectives include other poets, musicians like Tom Waits, Bono, other friends and contemporaries and even some complete strangers. But it's the film and his poetry that win the day.

There are great moments of Bukowski reading aloud `Dinosauria We' and `The Genius of the Crowd' put over some basic montage footage of Hank rambling around a Los Angeles that you may recognize in certain places, and which may look like a rocky plain on Mars as it has changed so much since then.

If you don't like poetry, or understand poetry; if you've never known truth or always felt poetry and literature pretentious ... then this film is for you -- and it is as important as anything you'll probably see for a long time to come.",1203811200,2,2054,4.425925925925926

Kudos to director John Dullaghan for producing and directing this sensational, in-depth documentary of Charles Bukowski (he devoted seven years to this project!).  As a huge fan of the avant-garde writer and poet, I was quite impressed with this film.  Like Hank himself, the film pulled no punches.  Whatever your feelings are about the man and his art, there is no denying one simple fact - the man was truly an original through and through.  There has never been anyone like him.

This documentary exposes all of his complexities - the good, the bad, the ugly - while never venturing into the maudlin (although it could have done sans the pretentious Bono interview).  One moment we love him, the next moment we abhor him, but that is the beauty of Bukowski.  For me personally, he is so real and true to himself and his art that no matter how vulgar, and vile, and repugnant he often times was, I admire the man for his honesty and vulnerability.  And what I most admire about this man is his remarkable courage.  Like his novels and poetry, this documentary has Hank baring it all.  It may not be pretty, but in a world populated with celebrities and their affected, artificial auras, at least it's real.  With Hank, it's simple, as the great comedian Flip Wilson used to say while playing his famous female character Geraldine - 'what you see is what you get!'

I think Tom Waits put it best when he called Bukowski 'the writer for the dispossessed; people who didn't have a voice.'  This film really shows just how true that statement is.  He was born into this crazy, cruel world poor, raised by an oppressive, abusive father, with one of the worst cases of acne you'll ever see, etc... He grew up in the lonely jungle of Los Angeles, where the separation between the haves and the have nots is never talked about in the media, but oh so real.  A lonely child, a lonely teen, a lonely man, whose only real desire in life was to write.  It's easy for the high-brows of the world to dismiss this artist as a drunk, sex-crazed, ignoble hack.  However, I challenge those of you who disdain and/or dismiss this man and his work, to watch this film.  He didn't have an easy life (to put it mildly!) but he persevered because of his art.  And I, for one, am very happy that he did.

This is a very enlightening, interesting documentary regardless of how you feel about the man.  If you are a fan of Hank's, then you will really be in for a nice suprise.  One of the best documentaries I have ever seen!",1191715200,3,2578,4.482832618025751
2509443,4,B000E8N8L6,"I am not judging this documentary on the lighting or cinematography whatever (you wouldnt want me to anyways).  I gave this documentary 4 stars because of the info relayed and the moments that we saw captured in Bukowski's life.

My negatives about the documentary: I watched this film on a whim and was so engrossed in the info I received, I just couldn't watch the film in an objective way to relay a good mix of negatives.

However, I do agree with another commentor how some of the interviews were a bummer.  From his last wife, Linda #2, I didn't feel any sincerity or care or emotion coming from her as she stood today.  And I feel as if thats an unfair statement to make about the documentary's appeal because I was truly doubtful of Linda's ""love"" for Bukowski versus being doubtful of the credibility of the documentary.

And then some of the other interviews ... like the guy who was Bukowski's first publisher, Bono, etc, I just found them really un-enlightening.

My main love for this documentary comes from my assumptions about Bukowski (through his poetry) being discredited by seeing the real man on this film.  I thought Bukowski was just a loud, ""dirty old man"".  And, in some sense, he was - but not in the way I had perceived.

Some of you guys might think Im simple but . . .

Good points

- I really loved hearing Bukowski's poems being read by Bukowski. He has a scratchy, but somehow gentle voice.

- I liked how Bukowski answered questions asked by reporters.  They certainly asked him the rollyoureye questions, like ""what is love?"" but he played along and answered them - in a very poetic way.  You could see him give the question considerable thought. Then he'd smirk and say something beautiful.

- I liked learning about the major ""points"" in his life.  Learning about his job.  His finances. His parents. His acne. The type of women he liked.  Nothing too in depth here, but enough.

- I don't think I fully understand Bukowski's view on women.  Despite the inadequacies in my interpretation, I was still engrossed by his relationship with women.

He was a virgin until he turned, what was it? 24?

He dated almost plain, sometimes ugly, even fat women sometimes.  (which was shocking.  i have read some of his short stories - and he did comment on the ""ugly"" appearance of his women, but i just somehow couldn't believe him bc of the way he talked about beautiful, young women in his poetry. but the documentary relayed that he almost would seek out the women weathered by life, the ugly ones).  egs, one of Bukowski's women who was interviewed had long white moustache hairs growning out of her chin. It took me awhile to stop focusing on the hair and start focusing on what she was saying.

And THEN there was the 'behind the scenes' taping of Barfly, where Bukowski momentarily turns into the very man he hates, his father, and kicks Linda #2.  TOTALLY did not see that one coming.

[another reason why I cant give a fair judgement to this doc ... I knew NOTHING about Bukowski but I've always been curious - so his life lived up to my expectations.  How can I fairly critique a film that tells me his life in such a way?]

Lastly, seeing Bukowski reading a poem about the very gender he ""disrespects"" ... and then crying.  That had to be my favorite part.

- Another scene I liked.  Regarding Barfly - I cant remember who played him (brando?), but Bukowski mentioned how the lead actor barged into the bar, chest pumped out, and exclaimed to everyone his entrance.  I forgot the exact saying, but Bukowski said the actor's line how he [bukowski] would have REALLY said it - subdued, with a sense of sadness.

Yeah.  I liked it.  Its one of the few documentaries I could watch more than 2 times.",1177286400,10,3730,4.545045045045045
2509444,5,B000E8N8L6,"Much like Charles Bukowski's writing itself, this outstanding film is both a labor of love and inspiration.  With ""Born Into This,"" John Dullaghan has provided us with a delectable and essential document, detailing one of the greatest writers and poets of the 20th Century.  Painstakingly interviewing everyone from former postal co-workers, artistic colleagues, biographers, childhood neighbors, and relatives in Germany to the likes of Tom Waits, Sean Penn and Harry Dean Stanton (and yes, Bono), Dullaghan spent years and almost went bankrupt in producing this wonderful work.  He even hired PI's to find people and went through Hank's FBI and employment files.

Now, all of this exertion, while heroic in and of itself, could still have resulted in a disjointed, rambling mishmash of a film.  After all, culling from so much material and sculpting it down to less than two hours of celluloid is no mean feat.  But with a yeoman's effort, Dullaghan has managed to make a compelling and coherent portrait of the artist as both a young and old man, and for this I thank him.

And while this film won't win any awards for sound, cinematography or editing, it is the substance in the subject matter, and the care of the filmmaker in choosing what we see, that makes this such a terrific film.  Besides, Dullaghan himself says in the director's commentary that ""to make a highly stylistic film would have violated his (Bukowski's) style.""

And he's right.  So we get grainy black and white footage of Chuck walking through LA, or driving the streets peering out from behind his cracked windshield, or drinking his way through some of his famously contentious poetry readings.  But in this film's case (as in Buk's writing) form is overwhelmed by function.  Thus, we get to be there when Charles breaks down in tears, later in life, reading a poem about a lost love.  We get to see the infamous footage (also found on the Bukowski Tapes) of Charles kicking and berating his wife.

But Dullaghan clearly loves his subject matter, and in presenting the many conflicting aspects of this complicated man, from the harsh to the gentle, Dullaghan does what any good documentarian would do: show every side of the argument and let the audience make up its own mind (and so far the audience has responded enthusiastically, to say the least).

That said, the filmmaker does try to provide a summary of the man himself by including the poem ""bluebird"" as a sort of soliloquy in the final act.  But even this choice is incredibly apt, as Bukowski's words do well to encapsulate the man himself (and who could do better?): ""There's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out, but I'm too clever - I only let him out at night sometimes when everybody's asleep.  I say, 'I know you're there, so don't be sad.'  Then I put him back.  But he's singing a little in there.  I haven't quite let him die.""

In ""Bukowski: Born Into This,"" we get a laser-focused look at this man who liberated poetry from the academics and gave it back to the people, bluebird and all.",1173571200,3,3046,4.752851711026616

2509447,2,B000E8N8L6,"Lots of fairly interesting clips of Bukowski speaking. Some of the bits of other people speaking on Bukowski are interesting, some are irritating. There is some of Bukowski's poetry recited in the film, though more would have been welcome.

 The film starts out ok and weaves poetry, clips, and anectdotes successfully. The film moves in a linear fashion through Bukowski's life and gets sidetracked and boring frequently. To the point that you start to get annoyed.

 Its pretty interesting seeing Bukowski, and some of the interviewees are intersting. I just didn't like the film however, it somehow struck a sour note despite some of the good material contained in it.

 I've given some thought as to why I didn't like this documentary, and I have come up with my answer.

 The documentary writer doesnt let Bukowski breathe in this film. He has Bukowski all 'figured out' in his mind and dissects him and then stuffs in clips to fit his little intellectual framework. Its kind of funny in the film how the Black Sparrow guy says that form comes in when spirit leaves. How arrogant of a documentary director do you have to be put a clip of that in your film and not see how structured and dull your film is? The funny irony of that clip is the highlight of the film.

 In a documentary on Bukowski I want to see him breathe, I want to connect with the essence of the man.

 So with that in mind that explains the negative feeling I had for this film. Restraining Bukowski and dissecting him in that manner is insulting and condescending, by the nature of the act.

 Heres a lesson for this documentary writer and all documentary writers: if you pin the butterfly down it croaks. Let it fly.",1170374400,7,1693,4.6

His drunken anger with his last wife caught on film, really made me see the pure alcoholic in him. But at the same time i could not but help loving Buk seeing him in this fashion. A fashion of honesty, sexuality, poetic sensitivity...in the midst of his alcholoic stupors and the painful childhood lurked a true overcoming bum...a revenge of the bum so to speak...he was awesome...",1156377600,4,711,4.696
2509451,5,B000E8N8L6,"So says the grave of Charles Bukowski a man who, behind his pocked and weathered face, had an ambition of which no one would have guessed. At this point, readers may have grown tired of hearing me rave about this or that documentary--as I have seen so many excellent ones over the course of the last year; however, ""Born Into This,"" is as good a bio-pic as any ever made. It is unbelievably interesting and artful. The director knew Bukowski well, and this footage is extremely intimate. Stylistically, its strongest feature is the superimposing of Buk's poetry and sentences across the screen--which are then reproduced at the same speed at which he speaks. It creates a powerful effect and this is never more true than when he passionately mouths the title poem.

It's really not a pretty tale. Bukowski led a sorrowful life. Although, its damage was somewhat mitigated by his later, unforeseeable, success in which ""the blondes with the [certain unmentionable physical attribute] came too late."" There was a certain, dare-I-say, nobility about this dirty and talented old man. He existed to drink, write, and have sex. He was what he was, and how many people can say the same? There was not a once of pretension in him. He had a high level of artistic integrity and wrote diligently every day. Even if one doesn't like Charles Bukowski or feels repulsed by him, his perspective was so unique that one must appreciate him. What a life!

2509453,5,B000E8N8L6,"I was abroad when this documentary came out, and never had the chance to see it before the DVD arrived. As a documentary, it's about as solid of a work as I've ever seen. Excellent effort by the filmmakers at assembling footage of Bukowski enduring interviews and the pressure of the stage. They also gathered a strong selection of people who were part of Bukowski's life to speak frankly about him -- from friends to essential interviews with publisher John Martin and, of course, Linda Bukowski, his wife of many years, who delivers the films final eulogy in a very touching moment.

The work is balanced in presenting the genius, the sadness and the anger of the man - all the elements that made him geniune, tragic and real. I did regret that there was one piece of footage missing from the film, which appears among the interviews shot of Bukowski by Barbet Schroeder, in which Bukowski says that he always tried to put humor into his work. That was a very illuminating moment for me and I think an important aspect of Bukowski's work, in particular, with his prose. Bukowski was a dark humorist which is one reason I enjoy him so much. Otherwise, I am quite pleased with the portrait they paint of this great writer.

I know alot about Bukowski. When I was in my 30's, I was dying to be a poet. But. instead, I decided it would be a good idea to run a poetry magazine -- just I loved poetry. I was living in Princeton and I began a poetry magazine. The mag was called ""Now This.""

I was so exhausted and moved by watching ""Born Into This"" that I waited a day later before even glancing at the bonus section. There, I saw a chapter titled ""A home movie of Charles Bukowski."" When I started my magazine and, naturally I had hoped and prayed Bukowski would contribute. In the end, he generously contributed eight poems to my magazine. The bonus DVD footage that I mentioned is the last footage of Bukowski ever giving a reading - and it was made for my magazine. Linda Bukowski had taped it and sent it to me for my magazine's first poetry reading in Princeton. What a trip to see that old fond memory of mine on dvd. I've had a copy of that tape since that time, but out of respect to the Buk and Linda I never tried to sell it or anything, though people begged me to. (I did give a copy of it once to a biker who worked the counter of Mondo Video A-Go-Go in LA, just cause I liked the guy). But I'm really glad to see Linda decided to release it for this DVD. It gave me high to see my great Princeton literary folly preserved into the digital millenium. Ah, Buk. You are missed. Thanks for releasing the tape, Linda.

I never met Hank, but I am grateful to him because his words helped me make sense of my life at a time when nothing else made sense. When I read Hank's books, it was like he understood my heart and it felt like he was a friend talking directly to me. Hank told it like it is for a lot of people and this is why his books will be read and loved for as long as there are lonely people in the world. I'm truly thankful to those who made this film for making it possible for me to see someone who means so much to me.

2509455,5,B000E8N8L6,"I'm glad this was made! Saw it in a theatre when it opened about three years ago and was happy to see it was out on DVD recently--and snapped one up off the amazon site right away.

Props to the filmmaker! A big thank you to Tom Waits (another favorite) for making an appearance and for reading the Buk poem. Others have tried to read Bukowski's stuff, and it just doesn't work, doesn't come off right. Waits is absolutely perfect for this sort of material and ought to consider doing an entire album of either Buk's prose and/or poetry.

Back to Bukowski for a minute: I don't care what his detractors continue to moan and gripe about when it comes to the man's work--because I said it more than 25 years ago and I'm still saying it today--and I will say keep saying it until the day I die: he was a mad genius!

 One good/solid third of his output is pure GOLD--and I am talking about the best stuff. As a result, he will be read forever. In my opinion, this guy remains the greatest American poet of them all, period.

A third of his output is fair, and the last third is quite lousy, in fact, unreadable (and I place Pulp in that last third bunch; some of the stories in Hot Water Music are weak; the novel Hollywood is really not as good as it otherwise might have been, etc) -- but, so what? How many great hitters, get the best,  can hit a homer each and every time at bat? Every single time? No way.

Did the writer have flaws and weaknesses as a man? Hell, yes! Who isn't flawed? I'm not perfect, and neither are you--or anyone else. All I have to say just take a real good look at what the man endured as a child, look what he lived through. And if you can't understand that, and don't get it, or simply REFUSE to get it...well, there is nothing else to be said.

I was pleasantly surprised to see how truly insightful Taylor Hackford's take on the man was, also Linda Bukowski's comments were quite poignant.

Where was the other Linda, by the way? Why was Linda King left out? And why was Ben Pleasants not included as well? And what about Dan Fante, the late, great John Fante's son?

Okay, I could be nit picking...

The one individual who to me, and this was some kind of downer, did not come off as incredibly bright (and by that I mean lacking true insight into Charles Bukowski) was his long-time publisher John Martin. Yes, give him credit for having had at least enough intelligence for seeing value in Bukowski's writing, but that's about it.

I could be wrong here, and I hope I am, but I have this feeling that the reason some of Buk's poetry lacks his verve and profundity/punch could be because Martin (or someone  employed by him) may have done some ""minor"" editing and/or trimming here and there. Like I said, I am only guessing --but some of the lines come across as truly weak and pedestrian in various volumes written towards the end of the writer's life.

Again, I could be wrong, but some of the material just does not hold up. Could have been Buk (having some off days; it happens--and I am talking about stuff written way before  illness was upon him) or it could be something else.

By the way, when will the Bukowski Tapes (shot by Barbet Shroeder)  be put out on DVD? Isn't it about time? Come on, Barbet!

John Dullaghan: again, thanks for hanging in there!

He is a gentle terrified boy underneath, but a sardonic and at times an abusive man on the outside.
It's comical in a dark sense to watch Hank being filmed as he drives around in his frugal automobile with a broken windshield going to the Laundromat.

Those who have never been to LA (as I have not) but have read much of Bukoswki's work will be able to fill in some gaps as to what his world looked like. The movie also has some interesting commentators, from Bukowski's editor at Black Sparrow Press, to his wives, to one of his co-workers at the Post Office.

At another point, he explodes with rage at his wife, who he thinks is cheating on him because she likes to go out. Buk also ""loses it"" on a French interviewer who wants to reduce his writings to being only about objectifying women. It's not really important whether you like or dislike Bukowski after seeing this. What is important is that it documents the life and works of one of America's best writers.

And there is footage of his private side - a gentle, family man living in the shadow of his cruel, abusive father.

Born Into This paints a fascinating portrait of a crude, hard-drinking man given to bouts of paranoia and jealousy. Bukowski led a hard life but one devoid of sympathy for his plight because it was a life he chose to lead. Dullaghan has put together a compelling doc that succeeds at dispelling many of the myths surrounding Bukowski and manages to celebrate his work while also showing his less than savory side. This doesn't demonize the man but rather humanizes him, presenting a fuller picture.

Six previously unpublished Bukowski poems are reproduced on this DVD. They will eventually see the light of day in a new collection to be published in January 2007.

""Bukowski's Final Home Movie Footage From 1992"" was shot by his wife and is considered to be the last known footage of him before his death in 1994. In it, he reads a couple pieces of his work.

There is a deleted scene where publisher John Martin recounts a story of how a female fan wrote to Bukowski, they met and spent a night together. He ended up writing about the experience. She is interviewed and recounts the experience from her perspective.

Also included are ""Extended Interviews"" with the likes of Taylor Hackford who gives us a walking tour of East Hollywood where Bukowski used to live and work as a postal carrier. Bono talks about the layers to Bukowski's work and its truthfulness.

Both Tom Waits and Bono read some of Bukowski's poetry. Waits, in particular, has that great gravelly, weathered voice perfect for the man's prose.

""Born Into This: Behind-the-Scenes Featurette."" The director talks about how he got into Bukowski's work and the impetus for the documentary. He credits Linda Bukowski with opening a lot of doors and giving him access to people like Bono and some of her husband's close friends.

Finally, there is an engaging audio commentary by the film's director John Dullaghan. The director talks about the extensive research and leg work he did and also goes into detail about Bukowski's life, pointing out things that didn't make it into the film. Best of all, he tells all sorts of great Bukowski anecdotes in this enjoyable track.",1143590400,7,2710,4.912472647702407

That said, I honestly think even people who don't like him should see this, as it's incredibly well-made.  Dullaghan, the director,  did an amazing job.  This really comes off as a labor of love.

I disagree with the people complaining about famous folks showing up in this.  If you want a balanced account, you need this element as many many many talented SOBs appreciate the genius of Buk.  Hearing from his friends and loved ones was great (esp. John Martin, his brilliant publisher).  All the video footage of Hank is priceless.  I have a new favorite movie!  Seriously.

How bitterly ironic that this amazing film about this incredible talent had a US box office of $0 million (according to the ""Theatrical Release Information"" listed on this page).

If you're a Buk fan, you should own this!  If you're Mr. Dullaghan, you should continue making films.  If you're not a Buk fan, you're no friend of mine.  Peace.",1143417600,3,948,4.795031055900621
2509462,4,B000E8N8L6,"If you want to get a fuller, more objective and less stylized picture of this man, I recommend Howard Sounes' excellent bio ""Bukowski: Locked In The Arms Of A Crazy Life.""  I found Bukowski much later than I would've liked...sadly enough, as an Ivy League English Lit major I had never even heard of him as an undergrad and after reading most of his work (in my late 20s while living overseas) I can see why.  The man spits in the face of every politically correct, East-Coast ivory tower, WASPish social and literary convention in existence...God bless him!  It's easy to see how feminists, cultural conservatives, lefty academics, ""New Yorker"" subscribers and all the other usual suspects would revile him.

This film is a great intro to Bukowski, I had never seen him on film before and he was an interesting subject to watch.  Just as scar-faced and ugly-looking as he often described himself, but surprisingly very soft and gentle most of the time---spoke in a very quiet and laid-back voice not the tough-guy snarl that he usually affects in his writing.

And that's always been the central enigma about Charles Bukowski, as both writer and individual: how to separate the pose from the person, the devil-may-care drifting and brawling barfly poet covering up for the terrified and tender little boy underneath?  Sounes' bio does a wonderful job of debunking many of the prevalent myths that have sprung up about Bukowski, most of them encouraged if not cultivated by the man himself.

This film barely touches on that, but for the most part its main aim is to present the writer and his writerly persona and body of work as one unified whole, with the decaying landscape of urban LA as the backdrop.  Several of his poems are read throughout the movie, sometimes by Bukowski, sometimes by celebrity admirers like U2's Bono and Sean Penn.  There are film clips of a few of his readings, still photos of him at the horsetrack, subtitled interviews he gave to European journalists.  The only darkish moments we see of Bukowski are when he becomes abusive towards Linda Lee (the woman he would end up marrying and spending the rest of his life with) after a few drinks during an interview and when he goes back to his childhood home and describes the horrifying abuse he suffered at his father's hands.

You can't really fault the filmmakers much since they have to work with whatever material is available, especially so many years after his death.  But it would've been nice had they also interviewed more of Bukowski's detractors and critics (which Sounes' book does), to get a more balanced view of the man.  Not that it would've done any damage to his reputation...once you've read Bukowski, it's darn near impossible to change your opinion of his work pro or con.  Instead this film sometimes feels more like a hero's tribute than a real documentary, which is disappointing.

At the very least however, this film deserves credit for giving wider exposure to Bukowski's work, which it richly deserves.",1143158400,10,3009,4.83625730994152
2509463,5,B000E8N8L6,"As the proverb states, in simplicity there is truth. So, I'll keep this short. This is THE documentary everyone has been waiting for on the late writer Charles Bukowski. The filmmaker approached the subject with an integrity and thoroughness that leave no questions unanswered. There are interviews with celebs, yes, but it's the interviews with Bukowski's more pedestrian intimates that will never be replicated, as some have passed on, and others are not likely to participate in such a project ever again. If you like Buk, get it. If you want to know more about Buk, get it. If you don't get Buk, get it. This filmmaker got it...and it shows.",1142899200,3,645,4.81981981981982
2509464,4,B000E8N8L6,"Like most i caught this in an Art House theatre (only one screening at 9 am on a Sunday morning), but i'd go so far as to say that if you've never even heard of Bukowski before, you need to watch this film...nothing i've seen goes further to destroy boundaries between the artist and the crowd, showing him as nothing other than a human who explored his talent for no other reason except that he had to...the pinnacle of integrity...one singer who features in this film could learn a little from him i think, and it's the appearence of a few of these 'celebrities' patronizing his work that knocks the review down to 4 stars...it's not needed...by Bukowski or the viewers...as the film shows ultimately - he stands alone, and he stands alone by choice...end of story...",1142640000,4,769,4.62043795620438
2509465,5,B000E8N8L6,"This documentary accomplishes what very few documentaries are able to: at points, you can see the real Bukowski seeping through. The vivid, sometimes uncomfortable footage of Bukowski coupled with interviews of friends, family and an impressive ensemble of famous friends and admirers (such as Bono...why is that guy everywhere?) makes this a very dimensional film. Bukowski's own interpretation of 'Bluebird' at the end is particularly powerful.

Beware, however, that some of the personages interviewed present some very misguided arguments concerning the validity of poetic structure. Not to worry, though. This film is so well made that it is easy to see their error.

PS- Film released 2002. Dvd released 2006. It's been a long wait for fans of this film! Enjoy.",1141084800,6,767,5.330578512396694
2509466,5,B000E8N8L6,"I stopped watching television about 14 years ago becasue of all of the commericalized garbage flooding out from the little screen into my home. I do watch videos and DVDs and it is a pure delight to me that they are bringing this extrodinary Bukowski documentary out on DVD. I saw it in a theatre here in San Fransico and I loved it so much. Why? Well becasue it was so real. It was about this man, Bukowski, survior of the United States Post Office that somehow, with poetry no less, escaped and soared from the really wretched miserable corner he was in and created his own life on his own terms. And he did it with with honesty to make a Santa Cluse blush. It is a powerful story and Born Into This needs to be given credit for not merely being superb film-making but for going behind the myth and introducing the very sensitive, teddy bear Bukowski behind the mask. That wrote as the great musicians make music. Before I went to see the film a young woman said it made her cry and I went and saw it and I see why. It doesn't hurt at all having Bono sitting down and singing Bukowski's praises either. I have two wishes. That people that have misjudged Charles Bukowski will watch this DVD and give him a chance and then go out and read his work. My second wish is that David Chase will make a Dirty Old Man series to follow his success with The Sopranos to prove it wasn't a fluke. And I hope John Dullaghan who made this fine documentary will make many more films. I guess that was three.",1140048000,11,1493,4.26056338028169
