2438027,5,B000BQYWT8,"A perfect guide for beginning and intermediate Texas Hold'em enthusiasts. A. Duke covers the basics of strategy and importance of thinking rationally when engaging the various betting positions, hands, flops and pot sizes.  She also explains the relationship of win expectation when gambling to make a particular hand. A definitely recommended video to play successful poker.",1221523200,5,375,5.696428571428571
2438028,5,B000BQYWT8,"I am truly a beginner, and this DVD was exactly what I needed. Annie Duke has a great demeanor, and she clearly explains the basics of Texas Hold'em in a manner that shows why this game is so popular. She has fun with her topic, clearly explains the basics, and gets into a fair amount of strategy. She discusses things like why one should or should not bet on a given hand--especially depending on their position at the table. She also discusses etiquette, and goes into great detail on a wide variety of ""what ifs"" that can take place during a game.

Highly recommended.",1188259200,11,572,4.5
2438029,3,B000BQYWT8,if you've never watched Hold'em on TV then you will find this video helpful but it is way too basic for anyone who has played in a casino or who has played at all in a home game with the exception of the small section on hand odds and pot odds...  It is nicely filmed and moves along well but is just too basic,1145318400,5,310,3.84375
2438030,5,B000BQYWT8,"I came across this DVD while at a poker trade show in Las Vegas.  I already own How to Beat the Big Boys and thought I would check this one out.  What a great way to learn the game.  As with her first release, Annie is an absolute genius at explainging the game of poker.  This is the only Poker DVD that I've seen that talks about Hold Em Basics in an interesting way.  I have been playing for a long time and even picked up some great tips.  I recomend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn how to play hold em.",1134864000,29,513,3.8846153846153846

8091161,2,B000BQYWT8,"There are a few things I didn't like about this DVD.
1) The production quality is quite poor; the picture is dark and the audio scratchy.
2) The graphics look cheap and contain spelling and grammatical errors.  For example, ""even if you play correctly, sometimes you will still ""loose"" (instead of lose), and ""in a home tournament, third place should receive 20% of the prize ""poll.""
3) Annie is a great poker player but not a very good instructor/speaker.  Too many ahs, ums, and okay? for an instructional video.
4) If you are a true beginner, having never played Hold 'em at all, her basic instructions go too fast and are confusing.  If you know just the basics, you'll be able to follow but won't learn anything new.
5) I was surprised that she claimed that there are ""two hands"" that will beat Quads; a straight flush and a Royal Flush.  A professional poker player should know that those are the same thing.  A five high straight flush is known as a Steel Wheel and an Ace high straight flush is known as a Royal Flush.  They're both just straight flushes.  It's like saying you can beat Quads if you have four Aces.",1394928000,,1123,4.502463054187192
8091162,5,B000BQYWT8,Just a beginner in Texas Hold'em. Love this video; it has been very helpful for me. I highly recommend it for beginners.,1392940800,,120,4.5
8091163,5,B000BQYWT8,"I bought a used copy of Annie's DVD not knowing what I was going to get.  I've just started learning how to play poker and at the age of 64, learning new things isn't that easy.  Having a background in video productions, I tend to be critical of video production and the quality people put into their product. I can't say enough good things about Annie's DVD.  Annie does an excellent job of explaining the game from start to finish, and the bonus features gives you a heads-up on what to expect when you go to a casino. The video quality is excellent and if I had any negative thing to say, it would only be that I would of liked to of seen Annie in a more professional looking wardrobe.(trivial comment compared to the quality of the DVD)  I'm so happy with her video, that when this one get used to a point of no return, I'm going to buy another one, but it will be a new copy.  I've already purchased her other video on how to beat the pro's, so the bottom line is:""Don't be a fool and buy someone else's video, when you can get hers for a great price, and really learn the game with a great deal of proficiency and skill!""",1340150400,,1127,4.175115207373272
8091164,4,B000BQYWT8,"This Video concentrates alot on the ""Etiquette"" of playing in a live game. It also covers playing position and some other very basic concepts. It is a good video for a total novice or someone who has never played live before. The price is a little much for this information as there isn't alot of stratagy here. Ed Miller's video cover stratagy very well.",1293753600,,355,4.5625
8091165,5,B000BQYWT8,Annie Duke covers all the basics those seeking to make the jump from watching the pros on TV to playing yourself need to know.  She is very personable and covers even the parts requiring math skills at a pace anyone could follow.,1253059200,10,229,4.4523809523809526
8091166,5,B000BQYWT8,"This is an EXCELLENT DVD for us beginner's out there. Annie moves from table etiquette and terminology, through cards to start with and from what table position, to playing strategy. She covers a lot of information thoroughly so by the end of the DVD you'll feel comfortable sitting down at a casino (or home game) without making a fool of yourself.",1238457600,5,349,4.737704918032787
