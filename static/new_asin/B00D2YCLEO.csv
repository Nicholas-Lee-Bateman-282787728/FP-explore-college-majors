5769763,5,B00D2YCLEO,i love his dvds. he makes you love yoga. he brings it down to doable level and makes it enjoyable for every day's people,1389139200,2,120,4.041666666666667
5769764,5,B00D2YCLEO,I love Rodney yee routines. This is a good basic workout to add to your library  I have enjoyed it.,1386115200,,99,3.95
5769765,5,B00D2YCLEO,Rodney Yee is one of the best yoga instructors on DVD. I have several of his DVD's and I love them all!,1384041600,,103,3.727272727272727
5769766,2,B00D2YCLEO,"I really like Rodney Yee and look forward to Yoga time.  However, this new DVD did not meet my expectations. I would not have purchased this one if I knew it was yoga with a chair. It is great for those looking for that but I was not.",1380672000,10,234,3.875
5769767,4,B00D2YCLEO,"This purpose of the 5 videos included on this dvd is for relaxation/stress relief. Don't expect it to be any type of power yoga or ""workout"" type of yoga. In fact, it would be good to do any of these right before going to bed (or a couple while in bed!). As with most of Rodney Yee's videos, there is a beautiful background, quiet music, and his soothing voice leading you through the positions. You will need to use a chair for all but one of the videos. Each video is 20 minutes in length, except the last one (meditation) which is 5 minutes.

Awaken & Energize: In this video, you start seated in the chair and go through gentle stretches like spinal twists, forward bends, then move on to using the seat of the chair for stretching your legs, hips, so on. The last 5 minutes is mostly relaxation pose. The stretches are gentle which is good for the morning.

Gentle Relaxation: Forward bends are utilized in this video (seated forward bend, head to knee, etc). You use the chair to rest your arms and forehead on.

Restore & Rejuvenate: Just about the whole of this video is relaxation pose. You start using the chair to open the chest (just for a couple of minutes, if that) then transition onto your back.

Soothe and Stretch: This is probably the most ""rigorous"" of the videos. No chair is used. He leads through standing forward bend, intense side stretch, wide legged forward bend, cobbler's pose, head to knee pose, etc.

Mountain Meditation: A bit different as Rodney Yee does not lead you through this 5 minute meditation. A woman who is not identified on the video guides you through the meditation.

Overall, good if you keep in mind its purpose- stress relief and relaxation. And ignore the upward facing dog on the dvd's cover as I don't believe that pose is used at all in any of the video's included!",1378252800,59,1818,4.51063829787234

5769778,1,B00D2YCLEO,"I had just bought 3 of Rodney's CDs for beginners. Beginner: a person just starting to learn a skill or take part in an activity.
They do not show any modified positions instructions on how the body stretches and how to release point of pressure to obtain these advanced positions they show on all of their CDs that I bought. The CDs are not for beginners they show nothing but advanced poses. I was hoping that they would show how to achieve an advanced pose from a stiff body...you cannot achieve the poses they show as a beginner.

Rodney Yee has a very soothing & gently approach into working out & relaxing your muscles...which helps with my anxiety, stress & other issues I suffer from.  I highly recommend this DVD.

5769820,4,B00D2YCLEO,"I'm new to Rodney Yee's DVDs. Normally I do more intense exercise, like Jillian's Michael's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-Body-Revolution/dp/B0091UIMK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels Body Revolution</a>, but I've been wanting to try something more gentle.

This DVD is mostly what I wanted it to be. There are five different routines, each about 20-25 minutes, though the fifth one is more of a 5-minute meditation than a full on yoga session. Three of the routines use a chair, which annoys me--but I know enough about yoga at this point that I can modify and do everything without it. If you are super beginner, the chair will probably be fine (and helpful) for you.

But I really like Yee's voice and the things he says during each workout. His voice is very calm, and he tends to frame the positions as positive, relaxing questions, like ""Do your eyes feel soft?"" or ""Is your neck long?"" I just like the way he ""directs.""

It's also nice that he encourages ""small adjustments"" during the moves. There is no push to be perfect or to nail that pose right from the start. He encourages you to listen to your body and adjust as needed. His laid back approach is actually a really nice change from the more intense ""PUSH YOURSELF HARDER!!!!"" approach that is common in high intensity interval training. I finish these routines and feel really calm. It's a nice start to my day.

I also bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rodney-Yee-s-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B001F76OKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners</a>, and I like it, too. There are only two routines on it, though--no chairs, but one of the workouts is with a different yoga instructor (a woman whose voice isn't as relaxing). But I am definitely becoming a fan of Yee's, and I plan on checking out more of his DVDs.",1461024000,2,1916,5.462837837837838

5769835,5,B00D2YCLEO,"I love Rodney's soothing voice. His cues are very detailed. The setting is pleasant. You need a chair for all but one of the videos. The chair has to have a back and it can't be too high or low. Your feet will need to be able to touch the ground comfortably. The videos are only 20 minutes long, and the one I've been doing: Soothe and Stretch, can be as challenging as you want to make it because you can go more or less deep into each stretch. This is the one that you can do without a chair. I have been wanting to get into yoga, and I think this is the perfect starting point for me to make it into a daily practice. Rodney models deep, deep stretching. His flexibility inspires me to challenge myself and to try to get as deep as he can into the stretch. I have a long way to go!",1448668800,4,784,3.9683544303797467

5769840,4,B00D2YCLEO,"I love Rodney Yee and have been using his yoga DVDs for almost 8 years intermittently. I've tried other instructors, for example, Shiva Rea, and while I think she is good her instruction just doesn't do it for me like Rodney. I find myself getting frustrated with the quiet pose descriptions she uses (a lot of something something asana something something asana and chuttarunga, whereas Rodney will just say ""push up position"") and often times she lacks verbal instruction, just intermittently skipping instruction at certain movements so I have to constantly be craning my neck at the tv rather than getting into a nice flow like I can with Rodney. Also, I find her program can feel much too slow, I have a limited time to workout and I really don't have time to spend 20 minutes doing mountain/breathing and heart prayer. I realize yoga is a combo of breathing, meditation, balance, strength and stretching but I like to get to the nitty gritty of it before my one year old wakes up from her nap :)  Rodney is my go to guy.
So I bought this Back Care Yoga dvd because after having two children int he past 3.5 yrs and being 40 my back has taken a beating and was hoping for some real back strengthening/stretching to relieve stiffness and pain. It wasn't quite what I was hoping for.
The reasons for the four stars instead of five is that this dvd is WAY too easy. It is not exercise at all, it's merely easy, simple and light stretching. I feel the DVDs title/description is lacking a bit. I gave this dvd to my 74 yr old dad and he is enjoying it.",1446508800,,1552,4.445614035087719

5769849,3,B00D2YCLEO,"I rented this DVD from the library instead of buying it on Amazon. I personally didn't care for these routines -- you use a chair for 4 of the 5 workouts instead of doing floor work, and the DVD is true to the title and focuses 100% on slow, gentle positions to slow down your body and mind. You also hold each position for a pretty long time so you're able to really relax and deepen into each one. There's no problem with any of those things; it's just not what I'm looking for in a yoga DVD. That being said, Rodney Yee is a gifted instructor who gives very structured, in-depth guidance on how to correctly do each position. The yoga moves themselves are great, too. This DVD would be especially good for people who want to get into yoga but need a starting point that is gentler and more joint-friendly than floor work.",1439078400,7,824,4.32258064516129

5769885,5,B00D2YCLEO,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that web site for more details.

Although this DVD is similar to many of instructor Rodney Yee's prior offerings in that it features several different yoga routines, each about 20 minutes in length, Yoga for Energy & Stretch Relief does have something a bit new to offer:  its three main practices all incorporate use of a chair.  (There is also a ""bonus"" routine which does not use the chair as well as short meditation segment which does.)

Yee instructs the four yoga practices outdoors in a pretty wooded setting (the bonus setting is oceanside); as is typical for him, he provides non-mirrored cueing via voiceover.  For the meditation segment, the setting shifts to an indoor studio with a fake nature background, and Yee is joined by his wife, Colleen Saidman, who provides the voiceover instruction.  I have given times and broken down each practice (as listed on the Main Menu) in greater detail below.  (Note:  The Main Menu of the DVD also includes an ""Audio Setup"" option which allows users to select ""Full Instruction"" or ""Music Only."")

AWAKEN & ENERGIZE (20:29)
This routine focuses on hip/hamstring stretches using the chair.  Yee begins seated on the chair for seated cat/cow, twist, and wide-legged forward bend.  Coming to standing, he places one foot on the chair for a half forward bend, performing full forward bend between sides.  Remaining standing, he also performs one-leg hamstring stretch on the chair followed by pyramid pose, head resting on the chair.  The final standing pose is wide-legged forward bend, head on the chair.  Yee then comes to seated with the chair resting behind his back and the hands in a meditation mudra.  The practice concludes with an approximately one minute relaxation (calves on chair) before finishing seated.

GENTLE RELAXATION (23:15)
This segment revolves mainly around a series of seated forward bends assisted by the chair.  Yee sets up seated with the chair in front of him; for each seated forward bend, he bends at the hips and rests his head on the chair.  The postures include cross-legged seated forward bend, cobbler's seated forward bend, one-legged seated forward bend, wide-legged seated forward bend, and full seated forward bend.  This routine ends with a lengthy (5.5 mins.) relaxation, resting the calves on the chair, several minutes in constructive rest pose, and very slowly coming back up to finish seated.

RESTORE & REJUVENATE (19:23)
This routine is an extended guided relaxation, using the chair to assist.  Yee begins by briefly sitting with the back to the chair in cobbler's pose.  Lying in front of the chair in cross-legged reclined pose, he performs a shoulder stretch/release.  Next, he rests with the calves on the chair and moves through about five minutes of guided relaxation.  He continues with several more minutes of constructive rest, and then the practice concludes with several minutes of seated meditation, placing the hands in the traditional meditation mudra.

SOOTHE & STRETCH (20:18) ~bonus
This routine also centers around hamstring openers, this time without use of the chair.  Yee opens with a standing forward bend and then moves right into a lunge/pyramid pose flow on either side.  He finishes the standing work with two variations of wide-legged standing forward bend.  Halfway through the practice, Yee moves to the floor for cobbler's pose, staff pose, one-legged forward bend, full forward bend, and wide-legged forward bend.  He comes briefly into constructive rest before concluding with a short (about 1 min.) savasana and final seated pose.

MEDITATION (5:28) ~bonus
As noted, this segment is led by Yee's wife, Colleen Saidman.  Saidman and Yee start the practice with relaxation, resting their calves on the chair.  After about 2  minutes, Saidman cues to come seated on the chair, shifting from relaxation to more of a body scan for the remainder of the routine.

Overall, I found this to be a well-done DVD.  Yee establishes a slow, methodical pace throughout these routines, fitting for a release aimed at ""stress relief.""  (A note about the title:  Gaiam released a prior video titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Stress-Relief/dp/B00002EPXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Stress Relief</a>&nbsp;that also incorporated use of a chair; it is unfortunate that Gaiam has not done a better job at differentiating the titles of their offerings.)  Both ""Awaken & Energize"" and ""Restore & Rejuvenate,"" with the many wonderful hip and hamstring stretches, would make great post-workout routines, and ""Gentle Relaxation,"" which is full of forward bends, would be perfect to facilitate restful sleep.  I found Saidman's meditation to be a bit of a weak link:  the short relaxation and brief meditation felt like not enough of either.

Although some might not enjoy the addition of a chair as prop to their yoga practice, it can be used to great advantage, and for the most part, Yee definitely does so here.  For this reason, I would recommend this DVD, rating it 4 1/2 stars overall.",1391817600,8,5173,5.211864406779661

8588793,2,B00D2YCLEO,"I usually love Rodney Yee's yoga videos, but this one was a miss for me. If you have mobility issues or do not want to do any ""active"" poses than this might be a great DVD for you. But if you have some basic yoga practice, this whole DVD just felt like sitting on a chair and laying on your back. There was barely any movement at all. It didn't feel like yoga at all. There is so little movement. I'm sure it would be relaxing if you just wanted to lay around and chill with his soothing voice calming you, it would serve that purpose. But for a girl who does yoga almost every day, this just was too slow, too boring, and just not for me. If you like chair yoga (I don't) you will like this.

I'm glad I got this from my library to try before purchasing. I will definitely not purchase one - I'll stick to my other RY yoga DVDS.",1527724800,,829,3.9939759036144578
