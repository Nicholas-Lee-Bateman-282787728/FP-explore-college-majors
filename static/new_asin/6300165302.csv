211774,5,6300165302,"This movie has been with me for about 10 years. It grew on me quickly and it has become one of those movies I watch again and again, usually about once a month. First of all, Jean Claude Van Damme is not in this movie, contrary to what you may read in the reviews (I just love that careful attention to detail from most reviewers). However, the people that *are* in the film do a fine job, particularly Walter Matthau who in my opinion is a very, very believable pirate. What is so interesting to me about this movie is that it is one of the few films where you legitimately feel as though you are just peeking in at a tiny episode in the lives of the characters. The film, in fact, ends exactly where it begins, and you are left with a sense that you've seen only one miniscule adventure in the lives of these pirates, who have had and are yet to have countless more. I would have to say that if you are even remotely interested in this era of our history, watch this movie. It is not the epic that ""Cutthroat Island"" tried to be (and failed at), but rather it is the somewhat comical and adventurous story of Captain Red trying to get his gold, at any cost whatsoever. I hope they eventually put this out on DVD, but I won't hold my breath.",987206400,25,1242,4.179166666666666
211775,5,6300165302,"""Arr, mateys, shiver me timbers!"" is what you feel like shouting while watching this involving modern pirate movie that should become a classic. Roman Polanski had wanted to make a pirate movie such as this one for a long time, starting in the Lodz Film Academy in Poland, and finally did it - unfortunately, the problems he had affected the movie and made it a theatrical flop. Quite unfairly, as it has everything a pirate fan might want - a lovely score, breathtaking scenery, props and settings, a script that is adventurous and funny, good acting - and plenty of fun and adventure! And, most importantly, the amazing Walter Matthau as the best stereotypical pirate cap'n you'll ever see! Matthau performance is breathtaking - I can see his Cap'n Red standing arm-in-arm with Blackbeard, Black Bart and Captain Kidd, shouting orders at the ""mateys""... Highly recommended for any fan of swashbuckling adventures - and for everyone else!

By the way, this film is easily available here on DVD. The DVD has ""Pirates"" in an uncut 2.35:1 widescreen version, with DTS/DD5.1 sound, and costs the equivalent of 5 USD. I've heard the film still has not been released in the USA - I wonder if it's true, and if so, why...",972172800,16,1215,4.785714285714286
211776,4,6300165302,"Walter Matthau is pricelessas hell bent on Gold Cap,n Red. Along with his Left Tenant Frog. I just love theway the script was written. Its worth watching just for the dialog. Seven and Twenty Years of unstinkin toyel,All  me savins! Matthau is perfect with every line. The wardrobe and scenic  locations are very convincing of that era and time. Cap,n Red and frog start  the movie on a raft afloat at sea,Frog just wants to not be eaten by the  Captain. But both are picked up by the Hated Spaniards and they soon  discover the ships cargo is a Gold Throne. From then on nothing else matters  to Cap,n Red. It has fantasticHumor woven in with real to life Pirate  action. This truly is a must see. And I still do not know how Matthau was  able to pull off the illusion of the pegleg. See what you think.",955238400,8,804,4.348993288590604
211810,5,6300165302,"One of the all-time best pirate movies, this one really should be distributed on DVD. Walter Mattau's portrayal of Captain Red was heavily copied in the new ""Tintin"" movie as Captain Haddock. The comedic action set the stage for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series. The period humor is subtle, the dialog funny and the characters highly entertaining as Captain Red's determined pursuit of a golden throne drives the story in some really crazy directions.",1369612800,,456,5.093333333333334
211811,5,6300165302,I've seen this movie several times and it is a terrific work of period drama / comedy. Walter Matthau's performance as Captain Red is one of his best roles ever and seems to be the inspiration for Captain Haddock in the new Tin-Tin animated movie. It's time to add this to my DVD collection to share with family and friends!,1358121600,,324,4.416666666666667

211813,5,6300165302,"If You think Walter Matthow is funny, this is a ""Side Splitter"". He even tapes His leg up to wear a ""Peg Leg"" like Kirk Douglas did in Snowey River"". Great adventuring from the start where starving on a ""Life Raft"" with ""Froggy"" is even hilarious..YUP.!  YoMatey.!  G-G",1350000000,2,269,4.583333333333333
211814,5,6300165302,This was one of my favorite movies growing up and after watching it it still is a really fun movie to watch. I only wish that I could find this on DVD at a fare price and in english. I guess if you want to look at the bright side of it all the VHS reenforces the nostalgia. If you haven't seen it I recommend that you go over visit your friend who has good taste in movies and borrow it from him.,1325894400,,396,3.783132530120482
211815,4,6300165302,"Because Pulanski was hit with criminal charges, and ran to Europe to escape, the Federal government banned his stuff.  I saw it in the 80's and now I am a history teacher.  The movie puts it an an authentic situation. The large chain that protects the harbor of Maracaibo, the ship, the costumes.",1316822400,3,296,4.566037735849057
211816,1,6300165302,"I'm a huge Polanski fan but this is poor and easily his worst film. Boring, dull, silly and lifeless.
AVOID",1269734400,,107,4.4
211817,5,6300165302,"This is one of my all-time favourite movies.  Of all the pirate movies I have seen, this one is so great because it is the most realistic.  While it is fanciful and crazy, the elements that are portrayed within this film and they way they are portrayed make you feel more like you are watching a film about actual pirates, as opposed to say Pirates of the Caribbean, where you feel as though you are watching a beautiful and epic piratical fantasy.  Walter Matthau, hands down, delivers one of the best pirate portrayals I've ever seen.  He's dirty, greedy, conniving and crazy, with grandiose leadership qualities.  Some people may be turned off by the relatively slower pace of the movie, but I find it to be perfect.  A brilliant movie and one my collection would not be complete without.

211818,5,6300165302,"My kids are also older now but these songs will forever remind them (and me) of when they were little!

211819,4,6300165302,"I have seen this film when it was released in VHS format. It was indeed bawdy but in a non offensive humorous way. When we got the DVD we were troubled by how it had been needlessly sensored. Scenes that were suggestive but less graphic than most TV dramas had been cut and the film lost a lot of its flow and in fact logic. I was terribly disapointed and continually search for an un-cut version. In its original form, it is a very funny twist to a pirate's tale and a tribute to the late Walter Matthau.",1217635200,5,505,4.163265306122449
211840,5,6300165302,"I saw this movie years ago and loved it. I used to think that Long John Silver was the penultimate pirate character but, then came Captain Red. The performance was top notch, and the story was entertaining with just the right touches of humor and adventure. I couldn't wait to get a DVD of this movie so I bought the foriegn version that plays well once you get past the start menu. This movie will not disapoint the pirate fans out there...it's a must see for any one who enjoys a good swashbuckler. I don't understand why this movie isn't available in the US on DVD!

211842,5,6300165302,Polanski may have his issues... But this movie seems more true to what a Pirates life was like than any other pirate movie I've seen!

211843,3,6300165302,Arrived very promptly.  Movie was in only fair condition.  Picture quality a bit muddled and pasty probably due to age and wear; but probably as good as could be expected from a well-used VHS tape.,1201392000,2,197,4.6
211844,3,6300165302,"First, this is a poor quality DVD with quite a few glitches.
That aside, the movie is....well...different.
I especially liked Captain Red's dialog. It was colorful.
The movie was not nearly as ""bawdy"" as I had been led to believe, but it does have one catch.
Any other pirate movie you see, the pirate actually is a good guy, just misunderstood, somehow.  The pirate always gets the girl, and the girl is always some duchess or something that is far above the pirates station in life.
Not this movie.
Pirates really went to sea for gold.  If they came across anything else, they would take it, too.  In this movie, that is what happens.  The pirates live happily everafter because they got the gold.  The girl got away, the pirates were a bunch of low lifes, very different from the way these movies have always played out in the past.",1183852800,13,835,4.54

211846,5,6300165302,"This movie may still hold the record for being the biggest money loser of all time, but it happens to be one of the funniest movies people have never seen. While slow at times, the outlandish sets, costumes and action more than make up for it. And if you love the crusty, crotchetty Matthau at his best, this is a must-see. I can not recall a movie with less dialog that has more humor in it. Who can ever forget lines like, 'What have you got in your little basket?' spoken when they are nearing execusion? Or 'It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needel than for an officer to enter the kingdom of heaven!' shouted as he insights a riot on ship? The final scene is the very definition of irony. My only hesitation is seeing this come to video is that ""Pirates"" may loose it's status as the biggest loser in Hollywood...",1156723200,4,837,4.270440251572327
211847,5,6300165302,"This film about a Pirate is not what you would expect. It is deceptive, bold, daring, and above all funny, very funny. I don't think that the original actor asked to do this film could have made it any better. Jack Nicholas could never be Walter Matheu and that is what makes this film different, very different. Usually Pirates in the Caribbean were different, but not like this, as I have read. This Pirate does get his gold though and has no crew, except for his Fighting for Love Leutinent Dunderhead ""the Frog"", whom is a young learning Pirate. The reason to be a Pirate in the first place, is the real reason they do so in the Caribbean at the time -- lack of jobs and lack of a life. The New World was just not as they expected and life back then was rather dry, boring, and near death if one was expecting any fun. If you knew the times that they lived in, and the conveyence of the Good Life of the Governors and others and the dancing of the time, chuck it all, for one must be insane according to those bold enough to think about being a Pirate and rather the extraordinary. The way the film goes about it though just has to bring a smile to your face, as you watch and view this film about such a insane Pirate in the first place. In this film, this Pirate is not dumb, but such an annoyance, he makes very little sense at all. The fact that he has faced death, and will defy everything is what makes this film funny. Walter Mattheu as Captain Red a real Pirate back then in the late 1600's even has philosophy and is a learned man and a very clever man, and had to be to sail a ship in the Caribbean. The way the film starts and ends just leaves the one viewing the film to never ever consider becoming a Pirate like they are -- ever - in the first place though. Anything back then in that Time would be better than to be this Pirate and that is even being considered of being a slave to the Spanish. But by the film you will dance, drink, play a game with other people and have a real sense that humans back then would do just about anything to try and end their life without really trying to end their boring life. Without hope, love, respect, or anything good, these type of humans did exist, and became a legend in their Times. I think the film is fiction though as only an adventure such as this could of came from Roman Polanski because I don't think another Director or Producer would consider making this film in the first place. It is creative in that respect and just demands a certain respect for making such a film in the first place. It is bordering on 'Gross' depending on how you view it, and still not so 'Gross' as to 'Gross' you out, but it may. It just becomes funny, very funny, after viewing the film though to those sitting and watching the film. The scenes may stick in your mind though off and on over the years though as you just have to remember this film as no other film you have ever seen. Doest Captain Red gain your respect or would you fear a Captain Pirate such as this one? Which ever way you think about the film at the end, you will think about this film.",1143072000,2,3104,4.175
211848,5,6300165302,"...There was Captain Red! This movie has to be one of the all time great pirate movies. It has everything you can ask for in a pirate movie. Action, Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Treachery, etc. Walter Matthau gives one of his most convincing and comedic performances as the the surly but benevolent Captain Red. All in all the film is a lot of fun. I'm surprised they haven't put it on DVD yet, but be sure that when they do, I'll be the first one in line.",1115683200,16,455,4.3023255813953485
211849,5,6300165302,"Pirates is one of Roman Polanski's most underrated films along with The Fearless Vampire Killers and the Tenant. While the latter two films are masterpieces, Pirates is a very good pirate film that's never received it's due.
Polanski redefines the pirate film while still paying tribute to the swashbuckling genre. This film is the perfect companion piece to The Fearless Vampire Killers. Walter Matthau gives an excellent performance as the fearless Captain Red and the rest of the cast's performances hit all the right notes. Polanski's direction is masterful as always. The photography and musical score are also very good. From a purely technical standpoint this film is excellent. The script is really the only thing that keeps this film from attaining greatness.
MGM who now hold the DVD rights (they now own the rights to the entire Cannon film library) must release this film as soon as possible in it's uncut, 124 minute widescreen glory (I suggest emailing MGM).",1085529600,6,972,5.08125

7803606,2,6300165302,"What a disappointment !!! This is the worst Polanski's film I have seen so far.  Its far worse than Chinatown (1974) and Tess (1979).  First of, the movie does not make much sense.  There are just too many plot-line gaps.  The film feels like a mash of individual scenes with identical beginning and ending.  The French actor playing the Frog, must have been the worst actor I have ever seen.  Everything about this film, except for the exotic filming location/setting and costumes, is terrible.  The special effects are laughable.  Instead of a parody of a historical piece about buccaneers, Polanski gives us kitschy and poorly made comedy with grumpy old Matthau and a plot that falls apart and does not engage the viewer.

7803610,5,6300165302,"Walter Matthau makes a great pirate & I don't know why it should have been a surprise to me looking back on all the cranky, crotchety characters he has played through out his career. With his sardonic humor & most of his characters having the self centered attitude of me first me second & me, me me!!! I am surprised he hadn't been cast as a pirate before this movie. Matthau is perfect in this light hearted comedy & I am sure with his talent he could have pulled off a terrifyingly cruel pirate had Polanski gone for a more serious movie. This is one of those movies that didn't get the recognition it deserved probably because there is a lot of subtle visual humor that's easy to miss. I like the fact that the pirates are not romanticized in this movie they are what they are greedy scoundrels with little to no moral center. This may be another reason the movie didn't do that well at the Box Office. I give this movie five stars for its outstanding set & period costumes & casting Walter Matthau as Captain Red a pirates pirate! Captain Red sets a straight course & doesn't deviate...GET THE GOLD!!!! No delusions of a Governorship,  no delusions of getting the beautiful young duchess as he hobbles around on a peg leg probably more concerned with passing a Kidney stone!

First, instead of relating the story of one man, Johnny Depp, there are two! The opposition between captain Red and Frog brings a game constantly renewed about the "" pirate identity "" or something like that.

Next, they are ugly and mangy , they are pirates ! there's no zoom-in and low-angle shots to glamorize a set of actors who finds its value in itself.

Also no time to lose for romantic intrigues. Let us say that the action itself is enough to comprehend the violent passions of the characters.

Finally, of course , the quest of the treasure . It must be said that the entire film is oriented toward it. We pay the consequences at the end which brings us back at the starting point. A good marketing operation ...",1397433600,,811,4.386666666666667
