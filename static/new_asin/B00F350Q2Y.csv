I happen to like the video graphics & the blending back and forth from the players and the graphics. I also have TD going back to Zeit. I did find the more I watched this the better I liked it, it kind of grew on me. At first I played it and set it aside for a month or so, but I came back to it later and dug it more the more I watched it.",1390435200,2,447,3.4356435643564356
8611827,1,B00F350Q2Y,"As a passionate Tangerine Dream fan since the early 1980s, and as the owner of almost 200 of their CDs and over a dozen of their DVDs, I never could have imagined myself giving anything they released less than four stars.
However, this DVD is a total disaster. Rather than focus the camera on the group as it performs live, the majority of the focus is on computer generated graphics, with a few fuzzy, poorly-lit shots of the band actually performing, and most of these shots only showing up half-screen. An incredibly frustrating 2.5 hours. One may as well just listen to the CD of this concert (which is excellent). There's really no point watching the DVD at all.
For fans who really want to see the group in action, in glorious color with incredible camera work, you can't go wrong with the ""Loreley"" DVD. While there are many other excellent Tangerine Dream concert DVDs, ""Loreley"" really showcases the genius and energy of this incredible band better than any other.",1383955200,4,973,4.729411764705882
