And none of it seems the least bit forced.  Great reminders that you become like those you hang out with, and the right choice needs continual reinforcement.",1349568000,,317,4.543859649122807
7950298,5,B00005QAS4,"This episode has no problem carrying out all of the characteristics of ""Little House on the Prairie"" that makes the series so wonderful. In this story, the Ingalls' adopted son Albert is forced to get a true taste of prejudice at a young age. The people who are supposed to be his friends turn on him and call him a ""Jew lover"" when he befriends and becomes the apprentice of a kind, elderly Jewish craftsman. Albert and the craftsman carry this episode all the way through--they are two beautiful people who come together to address the issue of prejudice and stress the meaning of love. Great acting, great story--I recommend it",1018137600,4,630,4.684684684684685
