4004717,5,B002W2U8V0,"Being Brazilian, and seeing no review of this movie, I felt compelled to write a few words recommending it. Excellent film about an impossible love between a poor boy and a rich girl (an inverted Sabrina-like story, if you like) with a not-so-happy ending, much like a modern Shakespearean drama set in a Third-World stage. Though predictable, the script is a very good. Good acting, fast action, very good photography. Not so impacting like the document-stylish City of God, and certainly not so chocking. But the film portraits very realistic situations and  reflect the true preconceptions, the parallel universes, and the divide between social classes in Brazil and specifically in Rio de Janeiro. A perfect tale about the downward spiraling effect of poverty: once you are poor, all your universe drags you even further down with very little chances of getting hold of a life-saver. This film is a good heir to Latin American reality cinema. I strongly recommend it.",1266796800,51,971,5.06875
4004748,5,B002W2U8V0,"Once Upon a Time in Rio is a beautifully moving movie about two people who fall in love. Their blooming relationship is ""doomed"" from the start because the young man, De', is from the most notorious favela (slum) overlooking Ipanema Beach in Rio, Brazil. The view from the favela is breathtaking, but the violence, gangs and drugs inside the hills of the favela take one's breath away! After violence strikes De' and his family, he grows up and works at a kiosk selling hot dogs, soft drinks and snacks on the Ipanema Beach boardwalk where he looks up and sees a beautiful young woman - clearly with a rich family to be living in such a high-rise building. Once Upon A Time in Rio will pull at your heartstrings as this movie is a modern-day Romeo and Juliet story! The beautiful views are breath-taking and sync-up with the 2014 World Cup views that Brazil gave to us during the competition. A Must-See!",1406160000,,904,4.58641975308642
4004749,2,B002W2U8V0,"Reviews on this films were way over its acting, production, location. Acting is really bad and the story brings nothing new to the table. Although I might keep it, I expected much more based on the reviews.",1397952000,,206,4.594594594594595

4004752,5,B002W2U8V0,This film shows the reality of the poor people in Brasil! Also the reality of the drugs traffic and its consequences.,1371600000,4,117,4.619047619047619
4004753,5,B002W2U8V0,"I truly love this movie!  It's filmed with very talented and passionate actors who really take you on a trip through their lives and love.  Having roots in Brazil, I (and really anyone) can see the big difference in the social classes there.  The education and chances for the poor are not good.  The two main characters did an outstanding job showing their family lives, surroundings, friends, personal circumstances, and finally...the way that they fell in love!  Its a sweet sad story, beautiful, but painful...as love in a divided country can be.  If you see it, you'll cry, laugh and love right along with them...Obrigada!",1337904000,9,627,4.923809523809524
4004754,5,B002W2U8V0,"This was an excellent independent film, however it is in Portuguese since it takes place in Brazil. The shipping took a day too long when i paid for expedited shipping. Other than that, the movie was new and in great shape!",1331769600,,223,4.463414634146342
4004755,5,B002W2U8V0,"I've watched this movie yesterday and, as a Brazilian, I am proud of it. ""Once Upon a Time in Rio"" became one of my favorite movies ever. The plot is about a love story, but the boy lives at a slum (Cantagalo) and the girl, at the most expensive neighborhood of Rio (Ipanema). He had a very sad life in his childhood, facing the problems of drug wars around the corner. Although being a hard-working guy, nobody looks at him just as a human being, but as someone who lives in a 'favela'. One important point in the movie: all you see could really happen - unfortunately. The most interesting fact is the main actor, Thiago Martins, was born at Vidigal (a favela) and, although he became famous, he still lives there. Asked why he didn't move, he replied: ""I thought of buying a house out of Vidigal to my mother, but I gave up. If I lived at Barra da Tijuca, nobody would ask me if I would move. I'm in peace. My background is there"". According to the actor, there is another benefit of living at Vidigal. ""I have the most beautiful landscape from Rio and people there cheer on me. Living in a slum makes me enjoy life. I am doing my best to succeed in my career and I am happy to show everybody that our community has its values"". This is a very sensitive story. I do recommend.",1325894400,15,1279,4.267489711934156
