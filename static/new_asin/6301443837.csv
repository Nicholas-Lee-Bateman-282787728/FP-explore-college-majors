340618,5,6301443837,"I agree with Megan S. that this is the greatest comedy routine ever.  I've loved Louie Anderson since his early days on the Tonight Show back in the 80s.  And being from North Dakota I have an appreciation for his midwestern family humor.  I originally had this on VHS but lost it many years ago.  What a treat to finally have it available on DVD.  Louie's brand of family comedy is absolutely wonderful.  No matter how many times I watch this routine, I still laugh outloud throughout the hour performance.  It's filmed at the Guthrie theater in Minneapolis, MN (Louie's home state), so the audience is naturally loving of both Louie and his routine.  This is the finest performance from one of comedy's greatest stand up comedians.",1190764800,3,733,4.716535433070866
340619,5,6301443837,"I love Louie's kind of humor, about family and growing up...and best of all, it is completely clean.  No bad words or offensive material.  Great fun!!",1186444800,,150,4.730769230769231
340620,5,6301443837,"It's a exercise DVD realy.  5 Second abbs. ""It's that funny"" This movie is one of the only comedians I understand and I have true laughter because of it.  Im just waiting for someone to beat me up for this dvd.  I havn't watched the shows with Eddie Murphy but I do know that there are now white people jokes.  This is defanatly part of my collection since there is no drama or violence.  Thanks again.",1182988800,,402,4.2368421052631575
340621,5,6301443837,"I just loved his show.  I saw this years ago and was looking everywhere to purchase it on DVD. Louie is so funny and I can relate to his adventures.  My family and I have a running joke regarding his ""Shirley lives here"" routine.  I think everyone would enjoy this show.",1171584000,8,270,4.254901960784314
340622,5,6301443837,"This hysterical family comedy hour will bring tears to your eyes and a stitch to your side. So many times we yell, ""My mom does that!"" or ""My dad sounds just like that!"" A laugh-romp from start to finish, you'll see yourself and your family in every joke. Love it!",1036540800,,264,4.3
340623,5,6301443837,I grew up watching this video and it is a total must see!,1014422400,,57,3.4615384615384617
340650,5,6301443837,I watched this originally years ago (in the 80's?) and have constantly stolen jokes from it to amuse people.  This video is probably the best stand up in Louie Andersons career IMHO.  It is almost clean enough for a family to watch together but some of the parts are a bit rough and adult....very little if no swearing however.  I need to convert it to DVD and get rid of the tape!,1376352000,,381,4.263888888888889
340651,5,6301443837,I have been searching for this video for a long time! Received it fast and it was in great condition. Thank you so much!,1359331200,,120,4.041666666666667
340652,5,6301443837,"Don't buy this for $100 from any of these sellers. Visit Louie Anderson's personal website. You can get a signed copy of this dvd for only $24.99 or an unsigned copy for $19.99.

LOVE LOUIE ANDERSON!",1329523200,19,199,4.527777777777778
340653,5,6301443837,"This is my all-time favorite comedy/stand-up routine.  Louie Anderson's facial expressions and body movements add so much to the hilarious material he does, poking fun at his family and himself.  And it's wonderful that it's CLEAN humor, no ""dirty"" jokes or cursing as far as I can remember...I haven't watched it in a while, but I have watched it at least 10 to 15 times, maybe more!  I wish I could find some more Louie stand-up, he was awesome!",1271721600,2,447,4.632911392405063
340654,3,6301443837,"While your service was excellent, the DVD did not contain the scene in it I was looking for that has become a family punch line over the years. So I purchase a DVD I didn't want really.

340655,5,6301443837,"My wife had mentioned seeing this standup with me a long time ago. Searched Amazon, and there it was. This is the best Louie, clean comedy, and funny like comedy should be.",1221264000,,172,4.40625
340656,5,6301443837,I agree with another reviewer that his acts now are better than his old ones. You can go to his websites and youtube to see his new stuff at the excalibur hotel. His old stuff focused mainly on his family which is still funny nevertheless. Im still waiting for life with louie to show up on amazon.,1214956800,,298,4.245614035087719
340657,3,6301443837,"I was nice to see an older video of Louie. Although some of the material was funny overall I found myself not amused. I have seen Louie in person a few years ago, and his material now has this older stuff beat.",1213920000,,210,4.023809523809524
340658,5,6301443837,"This is absolutely the funniest concert I've ever seen! It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud.  I had to pause this concert constantly because I was laughing so loud!  I've been quoting it for years! My friends and family quote me quoting Louie...they've never seen it since my vhs tape was stolen.  ""it's a good shoe""  ""it was only a quarter""  ""the cranberries!""  I'm cracking up now just from typing my favorite lines!  I'm so excited that it's out on DVD....it's timeless!  I'm ordering my copy right now!!  I can't wait to watch it with my family...it's wonderful knowing I won't have to worry about offending anyone.  They'll finally hear all my lines in context! LOL  I may have to get more than 1 so I have one to lend....",1200873600,4,732,4.428571428571429
340659,5,6301443837,"I have seen this several times and recently bought it as a gift for a friend.  If Louie's family isn't your family, you probably know one just like them!  I laughed till I cried at his look at real life, and recommend this to anyone who's ever been put in a head-lock, or accidentally re-started their car.  One of the best Stand -Up Acts ever recorded and he did it all without the ""F"" word.",1197504000,,392,4.2

7813237,5,6301443837,As stated previously. DO NOT BUY this DVD go to Louie Anderson's website and by a signed copy for 29.95. $100 for a DVD is absolutely criminal !!!!,1442793600,,147,4.285714285714286
7813238,5,6301443837,"An early show, full of homespun humor.  Not much need for cussing here for laughs, none at all.  Just his expressions can roll you on the floor.  I still am hunting for his routine about donuts and French Fries.  I pray that it is on disc somewhere.  Meanwhile, this set is hilarious.  Boyhood with a little brother?  Yoicks!",1423612800,,325,4.5
