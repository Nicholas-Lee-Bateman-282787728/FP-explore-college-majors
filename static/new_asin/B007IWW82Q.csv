5090384,3,B007IWW82Q,"James Bond (Marcus Dean Fuller) a man with an unfinished past takes a 200 foot fall off a local landmark. He survives; not only that but finds in the process that he has gained the power to heal people,

As with all people that gain abilities he must figure out why (if there is a why) and how to handle it. Eventually he will have to go home and come to grips with whom he is and in the process wrap up some unfinished business.

The pace is a bit slow and it counts on more visual than verbal description. You get the feeling that this is an independent film.

5090385,3,B007IWW82Q,"I admit that I was initially intrigued as the movie began; the characters were some what interesting, the music was decent, but at the half way point I began to wonder, is this movie going somewhere?  Where is it going?  I have to give credit to the leading man, he wrote both the story and screenplay, as well as directed and starred.  Ultimately though the movie, in my opinion, didn't arrive anywhere.  What was the ""choice"" that the ""hero"" was supposed to make?  The end was quite nebulous, which ruined, for me, any sense of connection with the film up to that point.  Maybe someone could explain it to me?",1339632000,,611,4.509090909090909
5090386,3,B007IWW82Q,"This is a bit like ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta but lacks, by comparison, in essentially every category.

Here's the scoop. James takes a dive off a 200 ft. cliff. But instead of buying the big one, he survives only to find out he now has the power to heal others. He does a stint in jail, for reasons I won't divulge, but heads back home after his release to try and put his life back together.

This started out pretty good. I found myself drawn into the story early on and found I liked the characters at first glance. But as things progressed I started to get frustrated. I don't want to say the story lacked focus but, for my dollar, they needed a more dynamic path to the end. I got it. I got what they were saying, but it needed more umph. Some of the scenes were a bit too cute and some didn't make much sense. Marcus Dean Fuller, the writer, director and lead actor, has spent most of his career in TV and it shows. The way some of the characters were drawn and the shots set up were very TV.

Fuller wrote the script for himself and he's the hi-light as far as the performances go. The other primary actors do a decent enough job but things slide down from there. The outdoor sets were cool. The indoor sets were run of the mill. The music was decent enough.

This is a decent indy effort. It's not a bad watch. Just don't expect too much out of it.",1339459200,,1362,4.167300380228137

8518066,5,B007IWW82Q,I know Marcus from our teenage years and I am proud of what he has accomplished towards his vision of his life. The movie is complex and interesting.,1500076800,,149,4.357142857142857

8518068,5,B007IWW82Q,"i loved this movie because of the simple human frailty it shows.  it makes me question how I would behave in these circumstances.  when James says his reality is nothing like Bruce Wayne's - it is easy to be a benevolent superhero when you are a billionaire, but a janitor suffering from guilt and living a life filled with loss and regret?  I thought it was well written and each actor played their parts perfectly.  it made me think, it made me feel- for me that means it gets 5 stars.",1431043200,,487,4.318681318681318

8518070,3,B007IWW82Q,"Not a bad movie.  From the previews I was expecting more.  Irritated that the previews came out back in 2011, but then I could never find a copy to watch.  Too much anticipation for too little payoff.",1393545600,,200,4.351351351351352
8518071,3,B007IWW82Q,"Almost all movies have closed caption feature. I assumed this did as well. I am deaf, so I really could not enjoy it. I gave it away rather than sending it back.",1389484800,,161,4.0625
8518072,2,B007IWW82Q,"The story was slow to build and I gave up on it after 45 minutes. The lead actor was not as good as the supporting actors. He was trying too hard to act, with exaggerated facial expressions, it just doesn't look natural. Not a bad movie but definitely not a must see. If you feel compelled to buy it ... wait for it to hit the bargain bin at the store.",1366588800,,352,3.971830985915493
8518073,3,B007IWW82Q,"I enjoyed the flick, but you have to have some suspension of belief to go along with the story line which wants you to believe it at face value.  I like surrealism, but I have to admit it seemed a bit on the corny side.  Nonetheless, I pulled for the main character so I must have been hooked...",1353369600,,295,4.068965517241379
8518074,1,B007IWW82Q,"This film has an interesting premise; however, it is poorly executed. The ending is not satisfying as there are loose ends left hanging. Confusing scenes and seemingly arbitrary actions and reactions give a disjointed feel. I watched it on Netflix. Glad I didn't pay for it.",1346457600,,274,4.978260869565218
8518075,4,B007IWW82Q,"The credits are still rolling as I write this, and I'm a little sad and a little hopeful at the same time. I think that's about the most you can expect from any drama: to feel something.

This is very much an indie film with an indie budget. It's also every bit a postmodern tale, so some plot points aren't fully explained. As another reviewer noted, the ending is a bit nebulous; it's the least satisfying part of the tale. The good thing about nebulous endings, though, is that you can decide for yourself what happened. In that regard, it reminds me of the infamous final episode of ""The Sopranos,"" which was sort of a Rorschach test; viewers had to interpret it for themselves.

I won't recount the plot, as others here have done that, but I will say that the lead -- who also wrote and directed -- was the strongest member of the cast. Other characters weren't fully realized, which could be a flaw or a device to keep the main narrative on track.

All in all, though, I found it an effective and thoughtful movie. The credits have stopped now, but I still feel that mix of hope and sadness. I still feel.",1346112000,,1111,4.383495145631068
