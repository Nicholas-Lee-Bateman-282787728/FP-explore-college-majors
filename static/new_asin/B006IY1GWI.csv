Corny.
Slap Stick.
Bawdy Vaudeville, strip club & back room comedy shows.
Oh, & nudity.  Cant forget the nudity.
Bunch of vignettes.  Overall, fun.  Can be a tad much at times.
Quality of the print I have isn't that great so there are a lot of scratches & pops.",1342569600,,270,4.36
4992400,5,B006IY1GWI,"This was just what it said on the tin! Good old fashion sex comedy, brought it for my wife who watched it years ago and she still found it so funny. Service was great and arrived in good time, thanks",1336953600,,199,4.0

4992402,1,B006IY1GWI,"I have spent so much time looking for this movie since I was a kid.  I really loved the follow up ""Can I do it til I need glasses.""  However, that film is selling at a ridiculous $180 for a DVD copy.  I've been told it is because Robin Williams had some nude scenes, and once he became wealthy, he purchased as many copies as possible to have them destroyed. So it is very rare.
However, this film sucks.  The jokes are old and funny, but this isn't an original DVD of the film.  This is just a copy, burned to a DVD and sold with a cheap sticker on it.",1473465600,,553,3.945945945945946

4992411,4,B006IY1GWI,"Not for everyone.  I saw this movie in 1974 and never thought I'd see it again.  Seemed a bit corny this time but I still laughed a lot.  I wish they would get the sequel  ""Can I do it until I need glasses..""",1454630400,,208,3.7674418604651163
4992412,4,B006IY1GWI,"Saw this in the theater back in the 70s, with some friends. Found it on Prime, which continues to add a nice selection of exploitation movies. Well done, Amazon. This movie is corny as all get out, with lots of nudity. Basically it's a series of dirty jokes we've all heard filmed in a cornball manner. Loved it.",1453507200,,312,4.396551724137931

4992414,1,B006IY1GWI,This video is a waste of time. It is cheaply made  and very awful and very sexist....avoid this video at all costs. Benny Hill did better with very similar material...this is a very blatant rip off of Benny Hill's antics instead watch Benny Hill if you must for this type of stuff.,1446336000,,281,4.403846153846154

4992421,5,B006IY1GWI,"Lots of dumb jokes, female nudity and skits.  I saw this in a theatre in 1983 with a similar feature.  Not bad...",1430697600,,113,4.090909090909091
4992422,2,B006IY1GWI,"It has a few decent yucks but for anyone over 40, and many under 40 also, these are the acting out of jokes we have mostly heard. If there is any cost involved, I would not see it. For free, it might be worth the time, but I make no guarantees. Some will like this movie, which I barely did, but I'm not going to be watching again with my brother-in-law or other family or friend.",1426982400,,380,4.0131578947368425
4992423,1,B006IY1GWI,"I thought it might be fun to watch this as I knew it was related to ""Can I Do It Until I Need Glasses"" which I hope to eventually see.  The first joke, lame.  The second joke, lame.  The third joke, lame and offensive (rape was the punchline.)  These aren't rapid-fire jokes, these are jokes that take a good minute to set up.  I turned it off after the third joke.",1426809600,,365,4.084507042253521

4992434,3,B006IY1GWI,"A series of scenes, ranging from sight gags and one-liners to little skits, in the spirit of Kentucky Fried Movie and others of that ilk.  Most are at a level that would make 12-year-old boys giggle, but I got a few good laughs.  And there's lots of T&A, enough to keep someone like me watching and waiting to see what comes next.

The picture quality is terrible, a poor transfer of a VHS tape that was none too good to start with.  You can still see the lovely naked bodies, though.

Worth a look for someone who enjoys raunchy humor.",1410393600,4,536,4.32

4992439,4,B006IY1GWI,"This movie is insane.  I would almost describe as a raunchier version of Kentucky Fried Movie, that being said I laughed a lot.  There are laugh out moments and some groaners, but worth a check if you enjoy sketch comedy movies.",1403049600,,228,4.536585365853658
4992440,1,B006IY1GWI,It's a very old movie. Seems like it was from the 60's. I'm sure it was good back then but times have changed and I expect more out of movies now. It was so bad I couldn't finish watching it and that really says something about the quality of this because I have sat threw some real turds before in hopes that they would get better. I am actually insulted that my amazon prime suggested it. Take this movie out of the rotation and leave it on the junk pile.,1402790400,,457,4.088888888888889
4992441,1,B006IY1GWI,"I guess I had higher expectations for this one, but not sure why.  It was corny.  I only made it through about 10-15 minutes before turning it off and taking it out of my Watchlist.",1401840000,,181,4.142857142857143
4992442,5,B006IY1GWI,This was a great movie for anyone with an open mind.  Those who voted 1 star or 2 stars are probably those who are informed citizens who also don't understand what is going on in the world today.  Wake up US and enjoy life.  Hopefully Amazon will put more of these very enjoyable movies to choose from in the future.  I also have Netflix and will now spend more time searching Amazon for preferred movies.,1401062400,,405,4.36
4992443,1,B006IY1GWI,A curiosity piece to remind us about how cheesy and acceptable soft core sex comedies were in the 70s.  I decided to stop watching about fifteen minutes in and I can still see!,1398902400,,176,4.333333333333333

4992445,4,B006IY1GWI,"These are old old jokes. Some are probably older than written language. There is a reason they have been told down the centuries.

They are funny.

They are not all funny to the same people all of the time, but they are all funny to some people some of the time.",1393459200,,262,4.117647058823529
4992446,1,B006IY1GWI,I thought this movie was dumb. The idea of a movie based on the oldest sex jokes out there and you couldn't even keep up whither the different jokes,1391817600,,148,4.137931034482759
4992447,5,B006IY1GWI,I saw this movie at the drive in and it is still just as funny. I am sharing it with my friends,1390780800,,95,3.3636363636363638

4992450,4,B006IY1GWI,"Other than trailing off at the end with the ""Sex Awards"" it was a pretty good sketch-comedy piece reminiscent of Kentucky Fried Movie.  There was way more nudity in the opening credits than in the rest of the movie, so it doesn't just rely on T&A to keep you interested. Some of the jokes I'd never even heard before,  so that was refreshing.  Some of them I had heard however,  but they weren't done justice in the film (bad comedic timing or cutting the jokes short). If you have Amazon Prime and don't get offended easily it's a good film. I wouldn't recommend anyone actually buy this though.",1388793600,3,596,4.4907407407407405
4992451,3,B006IY1GWI,It was a fun and sexy movie.  Very old school and cheesy but worth the time.  It's good for a laugh but past that not much else.,1387584000,,128,3.7037037037037037
4992452,2,B006IY1GWI,"some funny moments, but not enough to warrant sitting through the whole thing. the girls were mostly pretty, males were sleazy looking.",1383436800,,135,5.181818181818182
4992453,3,B006IY1GWI,This is a tacky but funny  set of raunchy jokes. Would be a blast at most college parties. :) One more word was required. Here it is ..... word. :),1376092800,,147,3.9
4992454,4,B006IY1GWI,"My husband saw this movie years ago and nearly laughed himself sick over it, so when I saw it advertised on Amazon I bought it for him for our anniversary (how romantic! lol). Not really my kind of humor (give me the Coen Brothers, any day), but hubby got a huge charge out of it, so if he's happy, I'm happy. Apparently this flick is pretty difficult to find, so was pleased to see it available here.",1370995200,,401,4.220779220779221
4992455,1,B006IY1GWI,"Another horrible Amazon Prime freebie better left in the trash bin. If it's supposed to be Prime why is it that evey time I watch something ""Prime"" I always get about 5 minutes into it and then start fast forwarding it to see if it gets better. Guess what they never do, Prime indeed. Even being free this isn't worth the bandwidth.",1366761600,,332,4.370967741935484
4992456,4,B006IY1GWI,"Classic sex jokes played out in real life with 70's style.  Quite funny.  Pull up your couch, grab a drink, shut off your brain,  and enjoy.",1360454400,10,140,4.3076923076923075
4992457,4,B006IY1GWI,"A really stupid movie.  It was a lot better when I was younger. But, I guess you could regard it as a classic and a must-have for any serious collector.",1355529600,4,152,4.066666666666666

Still funny.",1355356800,,97,3.85
4992459,2,B006IY1GWI,"Can I do it till I need glasses was a ""Classic!"" This was just average.  I bet if you are on something, it would be a funny movie!",1355097600,,130,3.642857142857143
4992460,5,B006IY1GWI,"This was a good copy of an old ""B"" movie.  Still filthy dirty funny and was a great trip down memory lane.  The pop one reviewer mentioned I remember being in the movie at the drive in so it was a flaw from the original.
