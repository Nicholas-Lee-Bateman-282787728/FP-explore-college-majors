2199974,4,B00074DY6G,"Whether or not you enjoy this movie will likely depend on the following two things: 1)Do you require a lot of action in your movies? If so, this one is not for you. 2) Do you enjoy movies about people and relationships (a 'chick flick' to give it a name, although I think this tag too often turns off people who might still like a movie)? If so, you may enjoy this one. The reason I only say ""may"" is because this is a movie with a cause - to stop the needless development of farmland - and the cause at times takes over the whole movie (and I say that in spite of the fact that this is a cause I can certainly get behind).

Beyond this one flaw, however, I enjoyed the scenery and the character development. I did think that it was unnecessary - maudlin, actually - to have the possibly HIV-positive storyline with Kimberly Norris Guerrero's character come up halfway through the movie. Her visiting out of pure nostalgia would have suited me just fine and would still have been quite believable.

I recommend this one if you want to feel like you've spent a couple of hours in a beautiful and quiet area of the country with some good friends.",1157068800,5,1144,4.316279069767442
2199975,4,B00074DY6G,"The story line is very touching and overall this is a good family movie. I have two children, ages 10 and 13, and I found nothing in this film offensive or gratuitous. (Truly suitable for all ages.) I live in Northern Michigan where Barn Red was filmed and the scenery is spectacular! I especially enjoyed the use of the area's ""old family names"" to give a personal touch to the script.",1128988800,12,386,4.450704225352113

8044582,4,B00074DY6G,"This was a much appreciated gift. Borgnine is always enjoyed in anything. People of a ""certain age"" should find it enjoyable. Delivery was prompt.",1365120000,,146,5.125
8044583,5,B00074DY6G,I never heard of this movie until the passing of Ernest Borgnine and while looking up what was available on Amazon I came across this movie and others. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and story.,1344988800,,211,4.435897435897436
8044584,5,B00074DY6G,As usual Mr. Borgnine was excellent. Talk about an actor getting better with age. God bless him and I hope he has more movies in the works. I read his book and he has no intentions of quitting. Kimberly Guearro was great. I am now a huge fan of hers. The story line was very real and true. It is sad to think that maybe someday farms as we know them now will no longer exist. I highly recommend this movie.,1339113600,,406,4.0246913580246915
8044585,4,B00074DY6G,"We have enjoyed this movie over and over again.  It was filmed in our neck of the wood and I love the lead actor.  Not a award winner, but we sure do enjoy watching it.",1290470400,,168,3.7714285714285714
8044586,4,B00074DY6G,"There is no denying that this film lacks the polish of a major studio release, but its heartfelt charm and sincerity makes the absense of theatrical ""slickness"" a true benefit.

The acting may be uneven and rough at times, giving it the look of a dramatization but the end result, remarkably, is a realism that makes other films seem artificial and contrived.

I can honestly say the film appeared to be made by ""amateurs"" -- but only in the true sense of that word: one who does something out of love rather than for money.

Borgnine, who talent has always been greatly undervalued, is perfect as the aging farmer facing a world pushing him to sell his farm. He exudes the type of all-American nobility that is more myth than reality, but the movie never depicts him as a caricature. Scenes of him cooking and baking, for instance, show that he's not your stereotypical 'farm boy.'

Guerrero is equally convincing and ""real."" Although attractive, her beauty never draws primary attention or makes her simply another pretty face. She's smart, compassionate, and comes with a complete set of personal issues that give her character dimension.

The villain is the only weak character, comical to the point of absurdity. Sadly, in real life, developers are usually far more clever and effective in manipulating zoning laws and come with an army of lawyers in tow. But that's a minor flaw in the film.

As a resident of Oregon, which is in the midst of a land use crisis, the issues explored in this film are close to my heart. Yes, I recognized that the real purpose of the movie was to promote proper land use policies, and I think it worked on that level. But it also worked on the level of good entertainment with people we care about and can root for.

I applaud all those involved in making this movie and recommend it.",1194652800,3,1821,4.636645962732919
8044587,4,B00074DY6G,I would have liked to see more veiws of the farm. Reconized Bingham township hall but not much more. I bought the movie because the farm used was of a relitive of mine. A great film on the plite of small farmers being forced out of farming by governemnt and housing marketers who have little concern for local areas and its inpact.,1175817600,5,331,4.354838709677419
8044588,5,B00074DY6G,I grew up on a family farm in Michigan and I am aware of the many problems facing them today. Farm land there is slowly being sold for development. It was very encouraging to view a film that correctly addresses many of those problems along with long term solutions.,1174608000,2,266,4.448979591836735
